a general stationary rotating axially symmetric extremal black hole. One of
particles is critical (with fine-tuned parameters) and moves in the outward
direction. The second particle (usual, not fine-tuned) comes from infinity. We
examine the efficiency $\eta $ of the collisional Penrose process. There are
two relevant cases here: (i) a particle falling into a black hole after
collision is heavy, (ii) it has a finite mass. We show that the maximum of
$\eta $ in case (ii) is less or equal to that in case (i). It is argued that
for superheavy particles, the bound applies to nonequatorial motion as well. As
an example, we analyze collision in the Kerr-Newman background. When the bound
is the same for processes (i) and (ii), $\eta =3$ for this metric. For the Kerr
black hole, recent results in literature are reproduced.

engineering features used by learning algorithms. Recent research in the
broader field of representation learning has led to significant progress in
automating prediction by learning the features themselves. However, present
feature learning approaches are not expressive enough to capture the diversity
of connectivity patterns observed in networks. Here we propose node2vec, an
algorithmic framework for learning continuous feature representations for nodes
in networks. In node2vec, we learn a mapping of nodes to a low-dimensional
space of features that maximizes the likelihood of preserving network
neighborhoods of nodes. We define a flexible notion of a node's network
neighborhood and design a biased random walk procedure, which efficiently
explores diverse neighborhoods. Our algorithm generalizes prior work which is
based on rigid notions of network neighborhoods, and we argue that the added
flexibility in exploring neighborhoods is the key to learning richer
representations. We demonstrate the efficacy of node2vec over existing
state-of-the-art techniques on multi-label classification and link prediction
in several real-world networks from diverse domains. Taken together, our work
represents a new way for efficiently learning state-of-the-art task-independent
representations in complex networks.

sensor-rich embedded platforms such as autonomous vehicles, wearables, and
others. A central problem in the design of such systems is the need to extract
information locally from sensed data on a severely limited energy budget. This
necessitates the design of energy-efficient sensory embedded system. A typical
sensory embedded system enforces a physical separation between sensing and
computational subsystems - a separation mandated by the differing requirements
of the sensing and computational functions. As a consequence, the energy
consumption in such systems tends to be dominated by the energy consumed in
transferring data over the sensor-processor interface (communication energy)
and the energy consumed in processing the data in digital processor
(computational energy). In this article, we propose an in-sensor computing
architecture which (mostly) eliminates the sensor-processor interface by
embedding inference computations in the noisy sensor fabric in analog and
retraining the hyperparameters in order to compensate for non-ideal
computations. The resulting architecture referred to as the Compute Sensor - a
sensor that computes in addition to sensing - represents a radical departure
from the conventional. We show that a Compute Sensor for image data can be
designed by embedding both feature extraction and classification functions in
the analog domain in close proximity to the CMOS active pixel sensor (APS)
array. Significant gains in energy-efficiency are demonstrated using behavioral
and energy models in a commercial semiconductor process technology. In the
process, the Compute Sensor creates a unique opportunity to develop machine
learning algorithms for information extraction from data on a noisy underlying

the data and hyperparameters can be quantized heavily without incurring much
penalty in classification accuracy when compared to floating point
implementations. These works suffer from two key limitations. First, they
assume uniform precision for the classifier and for the training algorithm and
thus miss out on the opportunity to further reduce precision. Second, prior
works are empirical studies. In this article, we overcome both these
limitations by deriving analytical lower bounds on the precision requirements
of the commonly employed stochastic gradient descent (SGD) on-line learning
algorithm in the specific context of a support vector machine (SVM). Lower
bounds on the data precision are derived in terms of the the desired
classification accuracy and precision of the hyperparameters used in the

non-star-forming ensemble. However, in a previous study we reported the
discovery of two embedded clusters (ECs) far away from the Galactic plane
($\sim5$ kpc). In our recent star cluster catalogue we provided additional high
and intermediate latitude cluster candidates. This work aims to clarify if our
previous detection of star clusters far away from the disc represents just an
episodic event or if the star cluster formation is currently a systematic
phenomenon in the Galactic halo. We analyse the nature of four clusters found
in our recent catalogue and report the discovery of three new ECs with
unusually high latitude and distance from the Galactic disc midplane. All of
these clusters are younger than 5 Myr. The high-latitude ECs C 932, C 934, and
C 939 appear to be related to a cloud complex about 5 kpc below the Galactic
disc, under the Local arm. The other clusters are above the disc, C 1074 and C
1100 with a vertical distance of $\sim3$ kpc, C 1099 with $\sim2$ kpc, and C
1101 with $\sim1.8$ kpc. According to the derived parameters there occur ECs
located below and above the disc, which is an evidence of widespread star
cluster formation throughout the Galactic halo. Thus, this study represents a
paradigm shift, in the sense that a sterile halo becomes now a host of ongoing
star formation. The origin and fate of these ECs remain open. There are two
possibilities for their origin, Galactic fountain or infall. The discovery of
ECs far from the disc suggests that the Galactic halo is more actively forming
stars than previously thought and since most ECs do not survive the
\textit{infant mortality} it may be raining stars from the halo into the disc,
and/or the halo harbours generations of stars formed in clusters like those
hereby detected.

objective is estimation of the tensor of connection probabilities $\Lambda$

graphon. In particular, in the context of the DSBM, we derive a penalized least
squares estimator $\widehat{\Lambda}$ of $\Lambda$ and show that
$\widehat{\Lambda}$ satisfies an oracle inequality and also attains minimax
lower bounds for the risk. We extend those results to estimation of $\Lambda$
when it is generated by a dynamic graphon function. The estimators constructed
in the paper are adaptive to the unknown number of blocks in the context of the
DSBM or to the smoothness of the graphon function. The technique relies on the
vectorization of the model and leads to much simpler mathematical arguments
than the ones used previously in the stationary set up. In addition, all
results in the paper are non-asymptotic and allow a variety of extensions.

in the understanding of sparse linear estimation problems as well as in
algorithms to solve them. It has also triggered a new wave of developments in
the related fields of generalized linear and bilinear inference problems, that
have very diverse applications in signal processing and are furthermore a
building block of deep neural networks. These problems have in common that they
combine a linear mixing step and a nonlinear, probabilistic sensing step,
producing indirect measurements of a signal of interest. Such a setting arises
in problems as different as medical or astronomical imaging, clustering, matrix
completion or blind source separation. The aim of this thesis is to propose
efficient algorithms for this class of problems and to perform their
theoretical analysis. To this end, it uses belief propagation, thanks to which
high-dimensional distributions can be sampled efficiently, thus making a
Bayesian approach to inference tractable. The resulting algorithms undergo
phase transitions just as physical systems do. These phase transitions can be
analyzed using the replica method, initially developed in statistical physics
of disordered systems. The analysis reveals phases in which inference is easy,
hard or impossible. These phases correspond to different energy landscapes of
the problem. The main contributions of this thesis can be divided into three
categories. First, the application of known algorithms to concrete problems:
community detection, superposition codes and an innovative imaging system.
Second, a new, efficient message-passing algorithm for a class of problems
called blind sensor calibration. Third, a theoretical analysis of matrix
compressed sensing and of instabilities in Bayesian bilinear inference
algorithms.

that the particle wall layer, previously observed and found to be responsible

$A$ and isospin $T$ can be used to test the isobaric multiplet mass equation
(IMME), which has, in most cases, been validated to a high degree of precision.
A recent measurement [Kankainen et al., Phys. Rev. C 93 041304(R) (2016)] of
the ground-state mass of $^{31}$Cl led to a substantial breakdown of the IMME
for the lowest $A = 31, T = 3/2$ quartet. The second-lowest $A = 31, T = 3/2$
quartet is not complete, due to uncertainties associated with the identity of
the $^{31}$S member state. Using a fast $^{31}$Cl beam implanted into a plastic
scintillator and a high-purity Ge $\gamma$-ray detection array, $\gamma$ rays
from the $^{31}$Cl$(\beta\gamma)$$^{31}$S sequence were measured. Shell-model
calculations using USDB and the recently-developed USDE interactions were
performed for comparison. Isospin mixing between the $^{31}$S isobaric analog
state (IAS) at 6279.0(6) keV and a nearby state at 6390.2(7) keV was observed.
The second $T = 3/2$ state in $^{31}$S was observed at $E_x = 7050.0(8)$ keV.
Isospin mixing in $^{31}$S does not by itself explain the IMME breakdown in the
lowest quartet, but it likely points to similar isospin mixing in the mirror
nucleus $^{31}$P, which would result in a perturbation of the $^{31}$P IAS
energy. USDB and USDE calculations both predict candidate $^{31}$P states
responsible for the mixing in the energy region slightly above $E_x = 6400$
keV. The second quartet has been completed thanks to the identification of the
second $^{31}$S $T = 3/2$ state, and the IMME is validated in this quartet.

and intermittency play an important role in the dynamics of these events. In
this work we investigate this fragmentation in high-resolution simulations of
jets in the closed-field corona. We study two realizations of the
embedded-bipole model, whereby impulsive helical outflows are driven by
reconnection between twisted and untwisted field across the domed fan plane of
a magnetic null. We find that the reconnection region fragments following the
onset of a tearing-like instability, producing multiple magnetic null points
and flux-rope structures within the current layer. The flux ropes formed within
the weak-field region in the center of the current layer are associated with
""blobs"" of density enhancement that become filamentary threads as the flux
ropes are ejected from the layer, whereupon new flux ropes form behind them.
This repeated formation and ejection of flux ropes provides a natural
explanation for the intermittent outflows, bright blobs of emission, and
filamentary structure observed in some jets. Additional observational
signatures of this process are discussed. Essentially all jet models invoke
reconnection between regions of locally closed and locally open field as the
jet-generation mechanism. Therefore, we suggest that this repeated tearing
process should occur at the separatrix surface between the two flux systems in
all jets. A schematic picture of tearing-mediated jet reconnection in three
dimensions is outlined.

$(H/h)^{d}/(\log(H/h))^k$, where $H/h$ is the ratio between the coarse and the
fine gird sizes, $d$ is the physical dimension and $k$ is the local stochastic

semidefinite with rank $K \le N$. Our goal is to decompose $A$ into $K$
rank-one matrices $\sum_{k=1}^K g_k g_k^T$ where the modes $\{g_{k}\}_{k=1}^K$
are required to be as sparse as possible. In contrast to eigen decomposition,
these sparse modes are not required to be orthogonal. Such a problem arises in
random field parametrization where $A$ is the covariance function and is
intractable to solve in general. In this paper, we partition the indices from 1
to $N$ into several patches and propose to quantify the sparseness of a vector
by the number of patches on which it is nonzero, which is called patch-wise
sparseness. Our aim is to find the decomposition which minimizes the total
patch-wise sparseness of the decomposed modes. We propose a
domain-decomposition type method, called intrinsic sparse mode decomposition
(ISMD), which follows the ""local-modes-construction + patching-up"" procedure.
The key step in the ISMD is to construct local pieces of the intrinsic sparse
modes by a joint diagonalization problem. Thereafter a pivoted Cholesky
decomposition is utilized to glue these local pieces together. Optimal sparse
decomposition, consistency with different domain decomposition and robustness
to small perturbation are proved under the so called regular-sparse assumption
(see Definition 1.2). We provide simulation results to show the efficiency and
robustness of the ISMD. We also compare the ISMD to other existing methods,
e.g., eigen decomposition, pivoted Cholesky decomposition and convex relaxation
of sparse principal component analysis [25] and [40].

information embedded within online health content that are good features in

techniques to identify candidate answers from resolved QA. In order to rank
these candidates, we implemented a semi-supervised leaning algorithm that
extracts the best answer to a question. We assessed this approach on a curated
corpus from Yahoo! Answers and compared against a rule-based string similarity
baseline. On our dataset, the semi-supervised learning algorithm has an
accuracy of 86.2%. UMLS-based (health-related) features used in the model
enhance the algorithm's performance by proximately 8 %. A reasonably high rate
of accuracy is obtained given that the data is considerably noisy. Important
features distinguishing a valid answer from an invalid answer include text
length, number of stop words contained in a test question, a distance between
the test question and other questions in the corpus as well as a number of
overlapping health-related terms between questions. Overall, our automated QA
system based on historical QA pairs is shown to be effective according to the
data set in this case study. It is developed for general use in the health care
domain which can also be applied to other CQA sites.

perform large scale data analytics. Since DRAM memories are expensive, some
researchers are suggesting to use other memory systems such as non-volatile
memory (NVM) technology to build large-memory computing systems. However,
whether the NVM technology can be a viable alternative (either economically and
technically) to DRAM remains an open question. To answer this question, it is
important to consider how to design a memory system from a ""system
perspective"", that is, incorporating different performance characteristics and
price ratios from hybrid memory devices.
  This paper presents an analytical model of a ""hybrid page cache system"" so to
understand the diverse design space and performance impact of a hybrid cache
system. We consider (1) various architectural choices, (2) design strategies,
and (3) configuration of different memory devices. Using this model, we provide
guidelines on how to design hybrid page cache to reach a good trade-off between
high system throughput (in I/O per sec or IOPS) and fast cache reactivity which
is defined by the time to fill the cache. We also show how one can configure
the DRAM capacity and NVM capacity under a fixed budget. We pick PCM as an
example for NVM and conduct numerical analysis. Our analysis indicates that
incorporating PCM in a page cache system significantly improves the system
performance, and it also shows larger benefit to allocate more PCM in page
cache in some cases. Besides, for the common setting of performance-price ratio
of PCM, ""flat architecture"" offers as a better choice, but ""layered
architecture"" outperforms if PCM write performance can be significantly
improved in the future.

two-layer fusion method which takes advantage of global and local cues and
ranks database images from coarse to fine (C2F). Departing from the previous
methods fusing multiple image descriptors simultaneously, C2F is featured by a
layered procedure composed by filtering and refining. In particular, C2F
consists of three components. 1) Distractor filtering. With holistic
representations, noise images are filtered out from the database, so the number
of candidate images to be used for comparison with the query can be greatly
reduced. 2) Adaptive weighting. For a certain query, the similarity of
candidate images can be estimated by holistic similarity scores in
complementary to the local ones. 3) Candidate refining. Accurate retrieval is
conducted via local features, combining the pre-computed adaptive weights.
Experiments are presented on two benchmarks, \emph{i.e.,} Holidays and Ukbench

explain the inner-mas structural changes. Observations with the GMVA offer
approximately double the angular resolution compared with 43 GHz VLBA
observations and allow us to observe above the synchrotron self-absorption peak
frequency. The jet was spectrally decomposed at multiple locations along the
jet. From this we derived estimates of the magnetic field. How the field
decreases down the jet allowed an estimate of the distance to the jet apex and
an estimate of the magnetic field strength at the jet apex and in the broad
line region. Combined with accurate kinematics we attempt to locate the site of
Gamma-ray activity, radio flares and spectral changes. Strong Gamma-ray flares
appeared to originate from either the ""core"" region, a downstream stationary
feature, or both, with Gamma-ray activity significantly correlated with radio
flaring in the downstream quasi-stationary feature. Magnetic field estimates
were determined at multiple locations along the jet, with the magnetic field
found to be >1.6 G in the ""core"" and >0.4 G in the downstream quasi-stationary

quantum chemistry and in computational material sciences. In this work we show
that density functional theory could shed light on phase transitions and
entanglement at finite temperatures. Specifically, we show that the equilibrium
state of an interacting quantum many-body system which is in thermal
equilibrium with a heat bath at a fixed temperature is a universal functional
of the first derivatives of the free energy with respect to temperature and
other control parameters respectively. This insight from density functional
theory enables us to express the average value of any physical observable and
any entanglement measure as a universal functional of the first derivatives of
the free energy with respect to temperature and other control parameters. Since
phase transitions are marked by the nonanalytic behavior of free energy with
respect to control parameters, the physical quantities and entanglement
measures may present nonanalytic behavior at critical point inherited from
their dependence on the first derivative of free energy. We use an
experimentally realizable model to demonstrate the idea. These results give new
insights for phase transitions and provide new profound connections between
entanglement and phase transition in interacting quantum many-body physics.

we consider the case that a WIMP pair predominantly annihilates into an
on-shell $\phi \phi$ pair with $\phi$ mainly decaying to $\tau \bar{\tau}$. The
masses of WIMPs are in a range about 14 - 22 GeV, and the annihilations of
WIMPs are phase space suppressed today. In this annihilation scheme, the
couplings of the $\phi$ - standard model (SM) particles are almost arbitrary
small, and the WIMP-nucleus spin-independent scattering can be tolerant by the
present dark matter (DM) direct detections. A scalar mediator-Higgs field
mixing is introduced, which is small and available. The lower limit on the
couplings of the $\phi$-SM particles set by the thermal equilibrium in the
early universe is derived, and this constraint is above the neutrino background
for scalar DM in direct detections. The WIMPs may be detectable at the upgraded
DM direct detection experiment in the next few years, and the exotic decay $h

hydraulically servo-controlled testing machines currently in use shows that
their grips are much too soft and light for observing the postpeak softening.
Based on static and dynamic analysis of the test setup, far stiffer and heavier
grips are proposed. Tests of compact-tension fracture specimens of woven
carbon-epoxy laminates prove this theoretical conclusion. Sufficiently stiff
grips allow observation of a stable postpeak, even under load-point
displacement control. Dynamic stability analysis further indicates that stable
postpeak can be observed under CMOD control provided that a large mass is
rigidly attached to the current soft grips. The fracture energy deduced from
the area under the measured complete load-deflection curve with stable postpeak
agrees closely with the fracture energy deduced from the size effect tests of
the same composite. Previous suspicions of dynamic snapback in the testing of
composites are dispelled. So is the previous view that fracture mechanics was
inapplicable to the fiber-polymer composites.

  included here in the appendices",,,,"math.ST stat.ME stat.ML stat.TH","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We study the residual bootstrap (RB) method in the context of
high-dimensional linear regression. Specifically, we analyze the distributional
approximation of linear contrasts $c^{\top} (\hat{\beta}_{\rho}-\beta)$, where
$\hat{\beta}_{\rho}$ is a ridge-regression estimator. When regression
coefficients are estimated via least squares, classical results show that RB
consistently approximates the laws of contrasts, provided that $p\ll n$, where
the design matrix is of size $n\times p$. Up to now, relatively little work has
considered how additional structure in the linear model may extend the validity
of RB to the setting where $p/n\asymp 1$. In this setting, we propose a version
of RB that resamples residuals obtained from ridge regression. Our main
structural assumption on the design matrix is that it is nearly low rank --- in
the sense that its singular values decay according to a power-law profile.
Under a few extra technical assumptions, we derive a simple criterion for
ensuring that RB consistently approximates the law of a given contrast. We then
specialize this result to study confidence intervals for mean response values
$X_i^{\top} \beta$, where $X_i^{\top}$ is the $i$th row of the design. More
precisely, we show that conditionally on a Gaussian design with near low-rank
structure, RB simultaneously approximates all of the laws
$X_i^{\top}(\hat{\beta}_{\rho}-\beta)$, $i=1,\dots,n$. This result is also
notable as it imposes no sparsity assumptions on $\beta$. Furthermore, since
our consistency results are formulated in terms of the Mallows (Kantorovich)
metric, the existence of a limiting distribution is not required.

the time-dependent density functional theory is reported. The inter-band
process is attributed to the dominant in HHG above the band gap. The photon
energy is set to 1.55 eV, and the cutoff energy of the plateau region is found
to be limited at the 19th harmonic (30 eV). The dependence of the HHG
efficiency at the cutoff energy region on laser intensity is consistent with
that of the hole density in the lowest-lying valence band. Numerical results

to twisted boundary conditions depending on an infinitesimal angle $\phi$ can
be used to analyze the Many-Body-Localization Transition. The sensitivity of
the energy levels $E_n(\phi)$ is measured by the level curvature $K_n=E_n""(0)$,
or more precisely by the Thouless dimensionless curvature $k_n=K_n/\Delta_n$,
where $\Delta_n$ is the level spacing that decays exponentially with the size
$L$ of the system. For instance $\Delta_n \propto 2^{-L}$ in the middle of the
spectrum of quantum spin chains of $L$ spins, while the Drude weight $D_n=L
K_n$ studied recently by M. Filippone, P.W. Brouwer, J. Eisert and F. von Oppen
[arxiv:1606.07291v1] involves a different rescaling. The sensitivity of the
eigenstates $\vert \psi_n(\phi) > $ is characterized by the susceptibility
$\chi_n=-F_n""(0)$ of the fidelity $F_n =\vert < \psi_n(0) \vert \psi_n(\phi)

displaying power-law tails $P_{\beta}(k) \simeq A_{\beta} \vert k

where $\beta$ is the level repulsion index taking the values $\beta^{GOE}=1$ in
the ergodic phase and $\beta^{loc}=0$ in the localized phase. The amplitudes
$A_{\beta}$ and $B_{\beta}$ of these two heavy tails are given by some moments
of the off-diagonal matrix element of the local current operator between two
nearby energy levels, whose probability distribution has been proposed as a
criterion for the Many-Body-Localization transition by M. Serbyn, Z. Papic and

simplicity of the new approach is very costly on other aspects: we find that
the SMA does not respond appropriately to changes in the risk profile of a

profiles across banks; that SMA capital results generally appear to be more
variable across banks than the previous AMA option of fitting the loss data;
that the SMA can result in banks over- or under-insuring against operational
risks relative to previous AMA standards. Finally, we argue that the SMA is not

importantly, it fails to create any link between management actions and capital

induces outgoing wave modes in the downstream plasma. For a fast shock wave,
the incoming wave modes can either be fast magnetosonic waves originating from
downstream, outrunning the shock, or eigenmodes of the upstream plasma drifting
through the shock. Using linear perturbation theory in relativistic MHD, this
paper provides a general analysis of the corrugation of relativistic magnetized
fast shock waves resulting from their interaction with small amplitude
disturbances. Transfer functions characterizing the linear response for each of
the outgoing modes are calculated as a function of the magnetization of the
upstream medium and as a function of the nature of the incoming wave.
Interestingly, if the latter is an eigenmode of the upstream plasma, we find

magnetically ordered insulating phase. Recently it was found that at low
temperatures, the heavily Cu-doped NaFe$_{1-x}$Cu$_x$As ($x > 0.3$)
iron-pnictide is an insulator with long-range antiferromagnetic order, similar
to the parent compound of cuprates but distinct from all other iron-pnictides.
Using angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy, we determined the
momentum-resolved electronic structure of NaFe$_{1-x}$Cu$_x$As ($x = 0.44$) and
identified that its ground state is a narrow-gap insulator. Combining the
experimental results with density functional theory (DFT) and DFT+U
calculations, our analysis reveals that the on-site Coulombic (Hubbard) and
Hund's coupling energies play crucial roles in formation of the band gap about
the chemical potential. We propose that at finite temperatures charge carriers
are thermally excited from the Cu-As-like valence band into the conduction
band, which is of Fe $3d$-like character. With increasing temperature, the
number of electrons in the conduction band becomes larger and the hopping
energy between Fe sites increases, and finally the long-range antiferromagnetic
order is destroyed at $T > T_\mathrm{N}$. Our study provides a basis for
investigating the evolution of the electronic structure of a Mott insulator

unknown due to rather weak spectropolarimetric signals. We address the matter
by using the 2D inversion code that is able to retrieve the information on
smallest spatial scales, up to the diffraction limit, while being less
susceptible to noise than most of the previous methods used. Performance of the
code and the impact of the various effects on the retrieved field distribution
is tested first on the realistic MHD simulations. The best inversion scenario
is then applied to the real Hinode/SP data. Tests on simulations show: (1) the
best choice of node position ensures a decent retrieval of all parameters, (2)
code performs well for different configurations of magnetic field, (3) slightly
different noise level or slightly different defocus included in the spatial PSF
produces no significant effect on the results and (4) temporal integration
shifts the field distribution to the stronger, more horizontally inclined
field. Although the contribution of the weak field is slightly overestimated
due to noise, the 2D inversions are able to recover well the overall
distribution of the magnetic field strength. Application of the 2D inversion
code on the Hinode/SP internetwork observations reveals a monotonic field
strength distribution. The mean field strength at optical depth unity is $\sim
130$~G. At the higher layers, field strength drops as the field becomes more
horizontal. Regarding the distribution of the field inclination, tests show
that we cannot directly retrieve it with the observations/tools at hand,
however the obtained distributions are consistent with those expected from
simulations with a quasi-isotropic field inclination after accounting for
observational effects.

access networks (CRANs). In the studied model, the baseband units (BBUs) can
predict the content request distribution and mobility pattern of each user,
determine which content to cache at remote radio heads and BBUs. This problem
is formulated as an optimization problem which jointly incorporates backhaul
and fronthaul loads and content caching. To solve this problem, an algorithm
that combines the machine learning framework of echo state networks with
sublinear algorithms is proposed. Using echo state networks (ESNs), the BBUs
can predict each user's content request distribution and mobility pattern while
having only limited information on the network's and user's state. In order to
predict each user's periodic mobility pattern with minimal complexity, the
memory capacity of the corresponding ESN is derived for a periodic input. This
memory capacity is shown to be able to record the maximum amount of user
information for the proposed ESN model. Then, a sublinear algorithm is proposed
to determine which content to cache while using limited content request
distribution samples. Simulation results using real data from Youku and the
Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications show that the proposed
approach yields significant gains, in terms of sum effective capacity, that
reach up to 27.8% and 30.7%, respectively, compared to random caching with

that the influence of the magnetic part of the Weyl tensor increases as the
number of masses in the universe is increased. We also find that the influence
of the magnetic part of the Weyl tensor increases with time, relative to the
leading-order electric part, so that its contribution to the scale of the
universe can reach values of ~1%, before the Taylor series approximation starts

privacy-driven is achieved by analyzing the semantics of the messages to be

semantic annotation mechanism that, by using knowledge bases and linguistic
tools, is able to associate a meaning to the information to be published. By
means of this annotation, our mechanism automatically detects the information
that is sensitive according to the privacy requirements of the publisher of
data, with regard to the type of reader that may access such data. Finally, our
access control mechanism automatically creates sanitized versions of the users'
publications according to the type of reader that accesses them. As a result,
our proposal, which can be integrated in already existing social networks,
provides an automatic, seamless and content-driven protection of user

We detect high-J (J_up > 13) CO lines and/or H_2O lines from 5 of 8 PBRS and
only for those with detected CO outflows. The far-infrared CO rotation
temperatures of the detected PBRS are marginally colder (~230 K) than those
observed for most protostars (~300 K), and only one of these 5 PBRS has
detected [OI] 63 micron emission. The high envelope densities could be
obscuring some [OI] emission and cause a ~20 K reduction to the CO rotation

that rotates clockwise or counterclockwise around the propagation direction of
the wave. According to the handedness of this rotation, its \emph{longitudinal}
spin angular momentum density is either parallel or antiparallel to the
propagation of light. However, there are also light waves that are not simply
plane and carry an electric field that rotates around an axis perpendicular to
the propagation direction, thus yielding \emph{transverse} spin angular
momentum density. Electric field configurations of this kind have been
suggestively dubbed ""photonic wheels"". It has been recently shown that photonic
wheels are commonplace in optics as they occur in electromagnetic fields
confined by waveguides, in strongly focused beams, in plasmonic and evanescent
waves. In this work we establish a general theory of electromagnetic waves
{propagating along a well defined direction, which carry} transverse spin
angular momentum density. We show that depending on the shape of {these waves,
the} spin density may be either perpendicular to the \emph{mean} linear
momentum (globally transverse spin) or to the linear momentum \emph{density}
(locally transverse spin). We find that the latter case generically occurs only
for non-diffracting beams, such as the Bessel beams. Moreover, we introduce the
concept of \emph{meridional} Stokes parameters to operationally quantify the
transverse spin density. To illustrate our theory, we apply it to the exemplary
cases of Bessel beams and evanescent waves. These results open a new and
accessible route to the understanding, generation and manipulation of optical
beams with transverse spin angular momentum density.

dynamics, with no approximations, is equivalent to that of two non interacting

non-intuitive nesting are systematically exploited and various intriguing
features consequently emerging in the dynamics of the two qutrits are deeply

Non-Orthogonal Multiple Access (MIMO-NOMA), in which a base station with $N_r$
antennas serves $N_u$ sources simultaneously. Both $N_u$ and $N_r$ are very
large numbers and we consider the cases that $N_u>N_r$. The GMPID is based on a
fully connected loopy graph, which is well understood to be not convergent in
some cases. The large-scale property of the MIMO-NOMA is used to simplify the
convergence analysis. Firstly, we prove that the variances of the GMPID
definitely converge to that of Minimum Mean Square Error (MMSE) detection.
Secondly, two sufficient conditions that the means of the GMPID converge to a
higher MSE than that of the MMSE detection are proposed. However, the means of
the GMPID may still not converge when $ N_u/N_r< (\sqrt{2}-1)^{-2}$. Therefore,
a new convergent SA-GMPID is proposed, which converges to the MMSE detection
for any $N_u> N_r$ with a faster convergence speed. Finally, numerical results
are provided to verify the validity of the proposed theoretical results.

Gaussians describing a metal-rich sub-population with means and dispersions
(-0.74, 0.18) dex and a metal-poor with (-1.33, 0.27) dex. The metal-rich
sub-population has a velocity dispersion ~ 8 km/s, whilst the metal-poor is
nearly twice as hot ~13 km/s. For the leading stream, the MDF is again
well-described by a superposition of two Gaussians, though somewhat shifted as
compared to the trailing stream. The metal-rich has mean and dispersion (-1.00,
0.34) dex, the metal-poor (-1.39, 0.22) dex. The velocity dispersions are
inflated by projection effects to give 15 - 30 km/s for the metal-poor, and 6 -
20 km/s for the metal-rich, depending on longitude. We infer that, like many
dwarf spheroidals, the Sgr progenitor possessed a more extended, metal-poor
stellar component and less extended, metal-rich one. We study the implications
of this result for the progenitor mass by simulating the disruption of the Sgr,
represented as King light profiles in dark halos of masses between $10^{10}$

Truncated Flat potential in the first phase of accretion and a triaxial Law \&

must have been $\gtrsim 6 \times 10^{10} M_\odot$ to reproduce the run of
velocity dispersion with longitude for the metal-rich and metal-poor

hence needs to be based, at least partly, on the knowledge of its specific

is used to describe the engine, obtained for example thanks to Finite
Dimensions Thermodynamics, such characteristic curve is often difficult to
obtain and takes an explicit form only for the simplest of these models. When
more realistic models are considered, including complex internal subsystems or
processes, an explicit expression for this curve is practically impossible to
obtain. In this paper, we propose to use the called Graham's scan algorithm in
order to directly obtain the power vs. efficiency curve of a realistic Stirling
engine model, which includes heat leakage, regenerator effectiveness, as well
as internal and external irreversibilities. Coupled with an adapted

gravity- and/or gravito-intertial modes that probe the inner stellar region
near the convective core boundary. The non-equidistant spacing of the pulsation
periods is an observational signature of the stars' evolution and current
internal structure and is heavily influenced by rotation.
  AIMS. We aim to constrain the near-core rotation rates for a sample of gamma
Dor stars, for which we have detected period spacing patterns.
  METHODS. We combined the asymptotic period spacing with the traditional
approximation of stellar pulsation to fit the observed period spacing patterns
using chi-squared optimisation. The method was applied to the observed period
spacing patterns of a sample of stars and used for ensemble modelling.
  RESULTS. For the majority of stars with an observed period spacing pattern we
successfully determined the rotation rates and the asymptotic period spacing
values, though the uncertainty margins on the latter were typically large. This
also resulted directly in the identification of the modes corresponding with
the detected pulsation frequencies, which for most stars were prograde dipole
gravity and gravito-inertial modes. The majority of the observed retrograde
modes were found to be Rossby modes. We further discuss the limitations of the
method due to the neglect of the centrifugal force and the incomplete treatment
of the Coriolis force.
  CONCLUSION. Despite its current limitations, the proposed methodology was
successful to derive the rotation rates and to identify the modes from the
observed period spacing patterns. It forms the first step towards detailed
seismic modelling based on observed period spacing patterns of moderately to
rapidly rotating gamma Dor stars.

spontaneously in rotating planar convection. Here we examine the dynamo
properties of such flows in rotating Boussinesq convection. For moderate values
of the magnetic Reynolds number ($100 \lesssim Rm \lesssim 550$, with $Rm$
based on the box depth and the convective velocity), a large-scale (i.e.
system-size) magnetic field is generated. The amplitude of the magnetic energy
oscillates in time, nearly out of phase with the oscillating amplitude of the
large-scale vortex. The large-scale vortex is disrupted once the magnetic field
reaches a critical strength, showing that these oscillations are of magnetic
origin. The dynamo mechanism relies on those components of the flow that have
length scales lying between that of the large-scale vortex and the typical
convective cell size; smaller-scale flows are not required. The large-scale
vortex plays a crucial role in the magnetic induction despite being essentially
two-dimensional; we thus refer to this dynamo as a large-scale-vortex dynamo.
For larger magnetic Reynolds numbers, the dynamo is small scale, with a
magnetic energy spectrum that peaks at the scale of the convective cells. In
this case, the small-scale magnetic field continuously suppresses the
large-scale vortex by disrupting the correlations between the convective
velocities that allow it to form. The suppression of the large-scale vortex at
high $Rm$ therefore probably limits the relevance of the large-scale-vortex
dynamo to astrophysical objects with moderate values of $Rm$, such as planets.
In this context, the ability of the large-scale-vortex dynamo to operate at low
magnetic Prandtl numbers is of great interest.

next-to-leading order corrections to linear and non-linear evolution in QCD. We
assume that the renormalization scale is the saturation momentum and found that
the scattering amplitude has geometric scaling behaviour deep in the saturation
domain with the explicit formula of this behaviour at large $\tau = r^2 Q^2_s$.
We built a model that include this behaviour, as well as the ingredients that
has been known: (i) the behaviour of the scattering amplitude in the vicinity
of the saturation momentum, using the NLO BFKL kernel, (ii) the pre-asymptotic
behaviour of $\ln\Lb Q^2_s\Lb Y \Rb\Rb$, as function of $Y$ and (iii) the
impact parameter behaviour of the saturation momentum, which has exponential
behaviour $\propto \exp\Lb -\, m\, b\Rb$ at large $b$.We demonstrated that the
model is able to describe the experimental data for the deep inelastic
structure function. Despite this, our model has difficulties that are related
to the small value of the QCD coupling at $Q_s\Lb Y_0\Rb$ and the large values
of the saturation momentum, which indicate the theoretical inconsistency of our
description.

interferences influence quantum transport in an intricate manner. However,
symmetries of the single-particle transformation matrix alleviate this

predict final states to occur with a vanishing probability due to total
destructive interference. Here we investigate the symmetries of hypercube
graphs and their generalizations with arbitrary identical subgraphs on all

self-inverse symmetries of the hypercube, lead to a large number of suppressed

symmetry, while the fraction of suppressed states is given by the number of
independent symmetries of the initial state. Our findings reveal new insights
into particle statistics for ensembles of indistinguishable bosons and fermions

that H{\sc i} absorption may be largely due to star-forming gas in their hosts.

the presence of disorder. Disorder leads to localization in the form of the
localized Anderson modes (AM), while nonlinearity is responsible for the
interaction between the AMs and transport. The dynamics of an initially
localized wave packets are concerned in both classical and quantum cases. In
both cases, there is a subdiffusive spreading, which is explained in the
framework of a continuous time random walk (CTRW), and it is shown that
subdiffusion is due to the transitions between those AMs, which are strongly
overlapped. This overlapping being a common feature of both classical and
quantum dynamics, leads to the clustering with an effective trapping of the
wave packet inside each cluster. Therefore, the dynamics of the wave packet
corresponds to the CTRW, where the basic mechanism of subdiffusion is an
entrapping of the wave packet with delay, or waiting, times distributed by the
power law $w(t)\sim 1/t^{1+\alpha}$, where $\alpha$ is the transport exponent.
It is obtained that $\alpha=1/3$ for the classical NLSE and $\alpha=1/2$ for
the quantum NLSE.

applied in [4-5] in studying high Tc(~100 K) in a FeSe grown on SrTiO3 [4] and
TiO2 [6]. The EPI is due to a long-range dipolar electric field created by the
high-energy oxygen vibrations (E0~90 meV) at the interface [4-5]. Besides
obtaining new results we also correct some misleading results from the recent
literature. We show that the mean-field critical temperature Tc0 is an
interplay between the maximal pairing potential and the FSP-width qc. For
Tc0~100 K the gap (G) is G~16 meV in agreement with ARPES experiments. We find
that in leading order Tc0 is mass-independent and there is small oxygen isotope
effect in next to leading order. In clean systems Tc0 for s-wave and d-wave
pairing is degenerate but both are affected by non-magnetic impurities. The
non-magnetic impurities are pair-weakening in the s-channel and pair-breaking
in the d-channel. The normal state self-energy at the Fermi surface gives rise
to the ARPES quasiparticle band at E=0 and to a replica band at
Er=-E0(1+l(m))^1/2, respectively. The EPI coupling l(m), which enters the
self-energy, is mass-dependent - the fact overlooked in the literature, makes
at low energies the slope of the self-energy mass-dependent. The smallness of
the oxygen isotope effect in Tc0 and its presence in the self-energy in FeSe
films on SrTiO3 and TiO2 is a smoking-gun experiment for the application of the
EPI-FSP theory to these systems. The EPI-FSP theory predicts a large number of
low-laying pairing states (above the ground state) thus causing internal pair
fluctuations. The latter reduce Tc0 additionally, by creating a pseudogap state
for Tc<T<Tc0. Possibilities to increase Tc0 by designing novel structures are
discussed in the framework of the EPI-FSP theory.

attributed to post starburst regions that do not have ionizing photons anymore

the gas presenting larger velocity amplitudes than the stars, with a deviation

effective rate to design two association schemes for load balancing in
heterogeneous cellular networks (HCNs), which are both formulated as such
problems with maximizing the sum of effective rates. In these two schemes, the
one just considers user association, but the other introduces power control to
mitigate interference and reduce energy consumption while performing user
association. Since the effective rate is closely related to the load of some BS
and the achievable rate of some user, it can be used as a key factor of
association schemes for load balancing in HCNs. To solve the association
problem without power control, we design a one-layer iterative algorithm, which
converts the sum-of-ratio form of original optimization problem into a
parameterized polynomial form. By combining this algorithm with power control
algorithm, we propose a two-layer iterative algorithm for the association
problem with power control. Specially, the outer layer performs user
association using the algorithm of problem without power control, and the inner
layer updates the transmit power of each BS using a power update function

normal-state and superconducting properties of the iron-based superconductors.
Because these materials are mostly metallic, a good starting point is an
effective low-energy model that captures the electronic states near the Fermi
level and their interactions. However, in contrast to cuprates, iron-based
high-$T_{c}$ compounds are multi-orbital systems with Hubbard and Hund
interactions, resulting in a rather involved 10-orbital lattice model. Here we
review different minimal models that have been proposed to unveil the universal
features of these systems. We first review minimal models defined solely in the
orbital basis, which focus on a particular subspace of orbitals, or solely in
the band basis, which rely only on the geometry of the Fermi surface. The
former, while providing important qualitative insight into the role of the
orbital degrees of freedom, do not distinguish between high-energy and
low-energy sectors and, for this reason, generally do not go beyond mean-field.
The latter allow one to go beyond mean-field and investigate the interplay
between superconducting and magnetic orders as well as Ising-nematic order.
However, they cannot capture orbital-dependent features like spontaneous
orbital order. We then review recent proposals for a minimal model that
operates in the band basis but fully incorporates the orbital composition and
symmetries of the low-energy excitations. We discuss the results of the
renormalization group study of such a model, particularly of the interplay
between superconductivity, magnetism, and spontaneous orbital order, and
compare theoretical predictions with experiments on iron pnictides and
chalcogenides. We also discuss the impact of the glide-plane symmetry on the
low-energy models, highlighting the key role played by the spin-orbit coupling.

clinical tool for functional imaging. A limitation of current SPECT systems is
the use of mechanical collimation, where only a small fraction of the emitted
photons is actually used for image reconstruction. This results in large noise
level and finally in a limited spatial resolution. In order to decrease the
noise level and to increase the imaging resolution, Compton cameras have been
proposed as an alternative to mechanical collimators. Image reconstruction in
SPECT with Compton cameras yields to the problem of recovering a marker
distribution from integrals over conical surfaces. Due to this and other
applications, such conical Radon transforms recently got significant attention.
In the current paper we consider the case where the cones of integration have
vertices on a circular cylinder and axis pointing to the symmetry axis of the
cylinder. As main results we derive analytic reconstruction methods for the
considered transform. We also investigate the V-line transform with vertices on
a circle and symmetry axis orthogonal to the circle, which arises in the

first grid-based 3D magneto-hydrodynamical simulations investigating the
evolution of magnetic fields during merger events. For this purpose, we employ
a simplified model considering the merger event of magnetized gaseous disks in
the absence of stellar feedback and without a stellar or dark matter component.
We show that our model naturally leads to the production of two peaks in the
evolution of the average magnetic field strength within 5 kpc, within 25 kpc
and on scales in between 5 and 25 kpc. The latter is consistent with the peak
in the magnetic field strength reported by Drzazga et al. (2011) in a merger
sequence of observed galaxies. We show that the peak on the galactic scale and
in the outer regions is likely due to geometrical effects, as the core of one
galaxy enters the outskirts of the other one. In addition, there is a physical
enhancement of the magnetic field within the central ~5 kpc, reflecting the
enhancement in density due to efficient angular momentum transport. We conclude
that high-resolution observations of the central regions will be particularly
relevant to probe the evolution of magnetic field structures during merger
events.

(NTL), which are losses that occur during the distribution of electricity in
power grids. In this paper, we build features from the neighborhood of
customers. We first split the area in which the customers are located into
grids of different sizes. For each grid cell we then compute the proportion of
inspected customers and the proportion of NTL found among the inspected
customers. We then analyze the distributions of features generated and show why
they are useful to predict NTL. In addition, we compute features from the
consumption time series of customers. We also use master data features of
customers, such as their customer class and voltage of their connection. We
compute these features for a Big Data base of 31M meter readings, 700K
customers and 400K inspection results. We then use these features to train four
machine learning algorithms that are particularly suitable for Big Data sets
because of their parallelizable structure: logistic regression, k-nearest
neighbors, linear support vector machine and random forest. Using the
neighborhood features instead of only analyzing the time series has resulted in
appreciable results for Big Data sets for varying NTL proportions of 1%-90%.
This work can therefore be deployed to a wide range of different regions around

stochasticity means that two stars with exactly the same `$x$', will have
slightly different `$y$'s. The relation between short-timescale brightness
fluctuations (flicker) of stars and both surface gravity and stellar density

framework, using Hierarchical Bayesian Modelling (HBM) to constrain the
intrinsic scatter in the relations. We find evidence for additional scatter in
the relationships, that cannot be accounted for by the observational
uncertainties alone. The scatter in surface gravity and stellar density does
not depend on flicker, suggesting that using flicker as a proxy for $\log g$

that the observational uncertainties tend to be larger for dwarfs.

significant X-ray spectral variation, a sharp spectral drop at $\sim$ 7 keV,
strong soft excess emission, and a hint of iron L-edge feature, which is very
similar to the NLS1 1H 0707$-$495. We have proposed the ""Variable Double
Partial Covering (VDPC) model"" to explain the energy spectra and spectral
variability of 1H 0707$-$495 (Mizumoto, Ebisawa and Sameshima 2014, PASJ, 66,
122). In this model, the observed flux/spectral variations below 10 keV within
a $\sim$day are primarily caused by change of the partial covering fraction of
patchy clouds composed by double absorption layers in the line of sight. In
this paper, we apply the VDPC model to IRAS 13224$-$3809. Consequently, we have
found that the VDPC model can explain the observed spectral variations of IRAS
13224$-$3809 in the 0.5$-$10 keV band. In particular, we can explain the
observed Root Mean Square (RMS) spectra (energy dependence of the fractional
flux variation) in the entire 0.5$-$10 keV band. In addition to the well-known
significant drop in the iron K-band, we have found intriguing iron L-peaks in
the RMS spectra when the iron L-edge is particularly deep. This feature, which
is also found in 1H 0707$-$495, is naturally explained with the VDPC model,
such that the RMS variations increase at the energies where optical depths of
the partial absorbers are large. The absorbers have a larger optical depth at
the iron L-edge than in the adjacent energy bands, thus a characteristic iron
L-peak appears. On the other hand, just below the iron K-edge, the optical
depth is the lowest and the RMS spectrum has a broad dip.

assumptions among latent and observable variables characterize the uncertain

modelled by specifying probability distributions that can depict different
response styles characterizing the uncertain raters. A marginal parametrization
allows a simple and direct interpretation of the parameters in terms of

functions. A true dynamical symmetry, where the Hamiltonian is block-diagonal
in subspaces defined by the group, is rare. More likely is a quasidynamical
symmetry: states with different quantum numbers (i.e. angular momentum)
nonetheless sharing similar group-theoretical decompositions. Purpose: We use
group-theoretical decomposition to investigate backbending, an abrupt change in
the moment of inertia along the yrast line, in $^{48,49,50}$Cr: prior
mean-field calculations of these nuclides suggest a change from strongly
prolate to more spherical configurations as one crosses the backbending and
increases in angular momentum. Methods: We decompose configuration-interaction
shell-model wavefunctions using the SU(2) groups $L$ (total orbital angular
momentum) and $S$ (total spin), and the groups SU(3) and SU(4). We do not need
a special basis but only matrix elements of Casimir operators, applied with a
modified Lanczos algorithm. Results: We find quasidynamical symmetries, albeit
often of a different character above and below the backbending, for each group.
While the strongest evolution was in SU(3), the decompositions did not suggest
a decrease in deformation. We point out with a simple example that mean-field
and SU(3) configurations may give very different pictures of deformation.
Conclusions: Persistent quasidynamical symmetries for several groups allow us
to identify the members of a band and to characterize how they evolve with
increasing angular momentum, especially before and after backbending.

rooted in early insights in bibliometrics, and is compared with several
established field-normalized indicators (e.g. the mean normalized citation
score, MNCS, and indicators based on percentile approaches). Garfield (1979)
emphasizes that bare citation counts from different fields cannot be compared
for evaluative purposes, because the ""citation potential"" can vary
significantly between the fields. Garfield (1979) suggests that ""the most
accurate measure of citation potential is the average number of references per
paper published in a given field"". Based on this suggestion, the new indicator
is basically defined as follows: the citation count of a focal paper is divided
by the mean number of cited references in a field to normalize citations. The
new indicator is called citation score normalized by cited references (CSNCR).
The theoretical analysis of the CSNCR shows that it has the properties of
consistency and homogeneous normalization. The close relation of the new
indicator to the MNCS is discussed. The empirical comparison of the CSNCR with
other field-normalized indicators shows that it is slightly poorer able to
field-normalize citation counts than other cited-side normalized indicators
(e.g. the MNCS), but its results are favorable compared to two citing-side
indicator variants (SNCS indicators). Taken as a whole, the results of this
study confirm the ability of established indicators to field-normalize
citations.

particle (denoted as the searcher) that is terminated when it reaches (detects)
a target particle or area the first time. In intermittent search the random
motion alternates between two or more motility modes, one of which is
non-detecting. An example is the slow diffusive motion as the detecting mode
and fast, directed ballistic motion as the non-detecting mode, which can lead
to much faster detection than a purely diffusive search. The transition rate
between the diffusive and the ballistic mode (and back) together with the
probability distribution of directions for the ballistic motion defines a
search strategy. If these transition rates and/or probability distributions
depend on the spatial coordinates within the search domain it is a spatially
inhomogeneous search strategy, if both are constant, it is a homogeneous one.
Here we study the efficiency, measured in terms of the mean first-passage time,
of spatially homogeneous and inhomogeneous search strategies for three
paradigmatic search problems: 1) the narrow escape problem, where the searcher
has to find a small area on the boundary of the search domain, 2) reaction
kinetics, which involves the detection of an immobile target in the interior of
a search domain, and 3) the reaction-escape problem, where the searcher first
needs to find a diffusive target before it can escape through a narrow region
on the boundary. Using families of spatially inhomogeneous search strategies,
partially motivated by the spatial organization of the cytoskeleton in living
cells with a centrosome, we show that they can be made almost always more
efficient than homogeneous strategies.

GW150914 at 1Gpc, SNR$\sim 90$ is achieved with the definition of Pre-DECIGO in
the $0.01-100$Hz band. Pre-DECIGO can measure the mass spectrum and the
$z$-dependence of the merger rate to distinguish various models of BBHs like
GW150914.
  Pre-DECIGO can also predict the direction of BBHs at $z=0.1$ with an accuracy
of $\sim 0.3\,{\rm deg}^2$ and a merging time accuracy of $\sim 1$s at about a
day before the merger so that ground-based GW detectors further developed at
that time as well as electromagnetic follow-up observations can prepare for the
detection of merger in advance. For intermediate mass BBHs at a large redshift
$z > 10$, the QNM frequency after the merger can be within the Pre-DECIGO band
so that the ringing tail can also be detectable to confirm the Einstein theory
of general relativity with SNR$\sim 35$.

candidates using the centroid shift of the images, which is induced by the
non-synchronous variations of the two nuclei. In this paper, a known binary AGN
(SDSS J233635.75-010733.7) is employed to verify the ability of this method.
Using 162 exposures in the $R$ band of \textit{Palomar Transient Factory}
(PTF), an excess of dispersion in the positional distribution of the binary AGN
is detected, though the two nuclei cannot be resolved in the images of PTF. We
also propose a new method to compare the position of the binary AGN in PTF $g$
and $R$ band and find the difference is highly significant even only with 20
exposures. This new method is efficient for two nuclei with different spectral
energy distributions, e.g., type I + type II AGN or off-set AGN. Large-scale
surveys, e.g., the Panoramic Survey Telescope and Rapid Response System and the
Large Synoptic Survey Telescope, are expected to discover a large sample of
binary AGN candidates with these methods.

flaring rates become increasingly higher for greater degrees of upward
evolution through the McIntosh classes, with the opposite found for downward
evolution; (ii) the highest flaring rates are found for upward evolution from
larger, more complex, classes (e.g. Zurich D- and E-classes evolving upward to
F-class produce >C1.0 rates of 2.66 +/- 0.28 and 2.31 +/- 0.09 flares per 24

all flare magnitudes, even when sunspot groups do not evolve over 24 hours.

and stripyhoneycomb lattices in lithium iridate (Li$_2$IrO$_3$), we study the
possible spin-singlet superconducting states on the whole series of harmonic
honeycomb lattices. Beginning with an isolated out-of-plane twist making the
honeycomb lattice three-dimensional, we find that the chiral d$\pm$id state,
well-known from the honeycomb lattice, is realized in the largest members of
the series at low to intermediate doping. Along the twist, four chiral edge
states form a two-dimensional dispersive band. Reducing the distance between
the twists to form the smaller members of the harmonic honeycomb lattices, the
degeneracy between the d-wave states is lifted, which finally destroys the
chiral state. By analyzing the hyper- and stripyhoneycomb lattices and
generalizing using the $D_{2h}$ point group of all the harmonic honeycomb
lattices, we show that the superconducting state often belongs to the trivial
irreducible representation. This state has nodal lines at low to intermediate
doping, which is possible because the full lattice symmetry allows sign changes
between different sets of bonds. We also find time-reversal symmetry broken
states, which are either fully gapped or feature nodal points, in certain parts
of the phase diagram. Finally, we draw a comparison between the states
classified in terms of the $D_{2h}$ symmetries and those observed on the

from pulsars and other millisecond-duration transients at low observing
frequencies and/or high DMs where time broadening of the signal due to
dispersive smearing would otherwise severely reduce the sensitivity. The
implementation, called 'cdmt', for Coherent Dispersion Measure Trials, exploits
the parallel processing capability of general-purpose graphics processing units
to accelerate the computations. We describe the coherent dedispersion algorithm
and detail how cdmt implements the algorithm to efficiently compute many
coherent DM trials. We present the concept of a semi-coherent dedispersion
search, where coherently dedispersed trials at coarsely separated DMs are
subsequently incoherently dedispersed at finer steps in DM. The software is
used in an ongoing LOFAR pilot survey to test the feasibility of performing
semi-coherent dedispersion searches for millisecond pulsars at 135MHz. This
pilot survey has led to the discovery of a radio millisecond pulsar -- the
first at these low frequencies. This is the first time that such a broad and
comprehensive search in DM-space has been done using coherent dedispersion, and
we argue that future low-frequency pulsar searches using this approach are both
scientifically compelling and feasible. Finally, we compare the performance of
cdmt with other available alternatives.

by the high-resolution HI data, shows low peak HI column densities and low HI
fluxes as compared to the molecular IVC. The molecular IVC exhibits a rich
molecular structure and most of the CO emission is observed at the eastern edge

transient and, thus, non-equilibrium phase. The average $X_\rm{CO}$ factor is
close to the canonical value of the Milky Way disk. We propose that the two
IVCs represent different states in a gradual transition from atomic to

there is a distinct class of events which are much more luminous (by $\sim2$
mag) than canonical core-collapse SNe (CCSNe). These events with visual peak
magnitudes $\lesssim-21$ are called superluminous SNe (SLSNe). Aims: There are
a few intermediate events which have luminosities between these two classes.
Here we study one such object, SN 2012aa. Methods: The optical photometric and
spectroscopic follow-up observations of the event were conducted over a time
span of about 120 days. Results: With V_abs at peak ~-20 mag, the SN is an
intermediate-luminosity transient between regular SNe Ibc and SLSNe. It also
exhibits an unusual secondary bump after the maximum in its light curve. We
interpret this as a manifestation of SN-shock interaction with the CSM. If we
would assume a $^{56}$Ni-powered ejecta, the bolometric light curve requires
roughly 1.3 M_sun of $^{56}$Ni and an ejected mass of ~14 M_sun. This would
also imply a high kinetic energy of the explosion, ~5.4$\times10^{51}$ ergs. On
the other hand, the unusually broad light curve along with the secondary peak
indicate the possibility of interaction with CSM. The third alternative is the
presence of a central engine releasing spin energy that eventually powers the
light curve over a long time. The host of the SN is a star-forming Sa/Sb/Sbc
galaxy. Conclusions: Although the spectral properties and velocity evolution of
SN 2012aa are comparable to those of normal SNe Ibc, its broad light curve
along with a large peak luminosity distinguish it from canonical CCSNe,
suggesting the event to be an intermediate-luminosity transient between CCSNe
and SLSNe at least in terms of peak luminosity. We argue that SN 2012aa belongs
to a subclass where CSM interaction plays a significant role in powering the
SN, at least during the initial stages of evolution.

between the monochromatic radio luminosity $L_R$ and the 2--10 keV X-ray
luminosity $L_X$, i.e. the correlation is unusually weak with $p\sim 0$ (in the
form $L_R\propto L_X^p$) when $L_X$ is below a critical luminosity, and steep
with $p>1$ when $L_X$ is above that luminosity. Such a hybrid correlation in
individual AGNs is unexpected as it deviates from the Fundamental Plane of AGN
activity. Interestingly, a similar correlation pattern is observed in the black
hole X-ray binary H1743--322, where it has been modelled by switching between
different modes of accretion. We propose that the flat $L_R$--$L_X$ correlation
of NGC 7213 is due to the presence of a luminous hot accretion flow, an
accretion model whose radiative efficiency is sensitive to the accretion rate.
Given the low luminosity of the source, $L_X\sim 10^{-4}$ of the Eddington
luminosity, the viscosity parameter is determined to be small, $\alpha\approx
0.01$. We also modelled the broad-band spectrum from radio to $\gamma$-rays,
the time lag between the radio and X-ray light curves, and the implied size and
the Lorentz factor of the radio jet. We predict that NGC 7213 will enter into a
two-phase accretion regime when $L_X > 1.5 \times 10^{42}\, {\rm erg\,s^{-1}}$.
When this happens, we predict a softening of the X-ray spectrum with the
increasing flux and a steep radio/X-ray correlation.

stations (BSs) to boost their capacity and offload their traffic by exploiting
the underused unlicensed bands. However, to reap the benefits of LTE-U, it is
necessary to address various new challenges associated with LTE-U and WiFi
coexistence. In particular, new resource management techniques must be
developed to optimize the usage of the network resources while handling the
interdependence between WiFi and LTE users and ensuring that WiFi users are not
jeopardized. To this end, in this paper, a new game theoretic tool, dubbed as
\emph{multi-game} framework is proposed as a promising approach for modeling
resource allocation problems in LTE-U. In such a framework, multiple,
co-existing and coupled games across heterogeneous channels can be formulated
to capture the specific characteristics of LTE-U. Such games can be of
different properties and types but their outcomes are largely interdependent.
After introducing the basics of the multi-game framework, two classes of
algorithms are outlined to achieve the new solution concepts of multi-games.
Simulation results are then conducted to show how such a multi-game can
effectively capture the specific properties of LTE-U and make of it a

heating and ionising source, we constructed the photoionisation model with
CLOUDY that matches the observed spectral energy distribution (SED) and the
line fluxes in the UV to far-IR wavelength ranges simultaneously. We could not
fit the ~1-5 um SED using a model with 0.005-0.1 um-sized graphite grains and a
constant hydrogen density shell owing to the prominent near-IR excess, while at
other wavelengths the model fits the observed values reasonably well. We argue
that the near-IR excess might indicate either (1) the presence of very small
particles in the form of small carbon clusters, small graphite sheets, or
fullerene precursors, or (2) the presence of a high-density structure
surrounding the central star. We found that SMC C60 PNe show a near-IR excess

maintain a structure nearby their central star.

a high coupling strength for the $\sigma$ band with $\lambda$ values of up to

This value is consistent with the recently observed kinks in the $\sigma$ band

multi-user MISO systems in the eyes of service integration. Specifically, we
combine two sorts of services, and serve them simultaneously: one multicast
message intended for all receivers and one confidential message intended for
only one receiver. The confidential message is kept perfectly secure from all
the unauthorized receivers. Our goal is to jointly design the optimal input
covariances for the multicast message, confidential message and AN, such that
the achievable secrecy rate region is maximized subject to the sum power
constraint. This secrecy rate region maximization (SRRM) problem is a nonconvex
vector maximization problem. To handle it, we reformulate the SRRM problem into
a provably equivalent scalar optimization problem and propose a searching
method to find all of its Pareto optimal points. The equivalent scalar
optimization problem is identified as a secrecy rate maximization (SRM) problem
with the quality of multicast service (QoMS) constraints. Further, we show that
this equivalent QoMS-constrained SRM problem, albeit nonconvex, can be
efficiently handled based on a two-stage optimization approach, including
solving a sequence of semidefinite programs. Moreover, we also extend the SRRM
problem to an imperfect channel state information (CSI) case where a worst-case
robust formulation is considered. In particular, while transmit beamforming is
generally a suboptimal technique to the SRRM problem, we prove that it is
optimal for the confidential message transmission whether in the perfect CSI
scenario or in the imperfect CSI scenario. Finally, numerical results
demonstrate that the AN-aided transmit designs are effective in expanding the
achievable secrecy rate regions.

differ (albeit temporarily) from the monitor model assumptions.

completely different considerations.

  dissipationless spintronics and new (quantum) anomalous spin Hall effects","5 pages, 7 figues",,"10.1093/nsr/nww069",,"cond-mat.mes-hall cond-mat.mtrl-sci","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  It is proposed that the new generation of spintronics should be ideally
massless and dissipationless for the realization of ultra-fast and
ultra-low-power spintronic devices. We demonstrate that the spin-gapless
materials with linear energy dispersion are unique materials that can realize
these massless and dissipationless states. Furthermore, we propose four new
types of spin Hall effects which consist of spin accumulation of equal numbers
of electrons and holes having the same or opposite spin polarization at the
sample edge in Hall effect measurements, but with vanishing Hall voltage. These
new Hall effects can be classified as (quantum) anomalous spin Hall effects.
The physics for massless and dissipationless spintronics and the new spin Hall
effects are presented for spin-gapless semiconductors with either linear or
parabolic dispersion. New possible candidates for Dirac-type or parabolic type
spin-gapless semiconductors are demonstrated in ferromagnetic monolayers of
simple oxides with either honeycomb or square lattices.

  Classifier Ensemble",,,,,"cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In this paper, we present the design of error-resilient machine learning
architectures by employing a distributed machine learning framework referred to
as classifier ensemble (CE). CE combines several simple classifiers to obtain a
strong one. In contrast, centralized machine learning employs a single complex
block. We compare the random forest (RF) and the support vector machine (SVM),
which are representative techniques from the CE and centralized frameworks,
respectively. Employing the dataset from UCI machine learning repository and
architectural-level error models in a commercial 45 nm CMOS process, it is
demonstrated that RF-based architectures are significantly more robust than SVM
architectures in presence of timing errors due to process variations in
near-threshold voltage (NTV) regions (0.3 V - 0.7 V). In particular, the RF
architecture exhibits a detection accuracy (P_{det}) that varies by 3.2% while
maintaining a median P_{det} > 0.9 at a gate level delay variation of 28.9% .
In comparison, SVM exhibits a P_{det} that varies by 16.8%. Additionally, we
propose an error weighted voting technique that incorporates the timing error
statistics of the NTV circuit fabric to further enhance robustness. Simulation
results confirm that the error weighted voting achieves a P_{det} that varies
by only 1.4%, which is 12X lower compared to SVM.
