learning a model of the object's appearance exclusively online, using as sole
training data the video itself. Despite the success of these methods, their
online-only approach inherently limits the richness of the model they can
learn. Recently, several attempts have been made to exploit the expressive
power of deep convolutional networks. However, when the object to track is not
known beforehand, it is necessary to perform Stochastic Gradient Descent online
to adapt the weights of the network, severely compromising the speed of the
system. In this paper we equip a basic tracking algorithm with a novel
fully-convolutional Siamese network trained end-to-end on the ILSVRC15 dataset
for object detection in video. Our tracker operates at frame-rates beyond
real-time and, despite its extreme simplicity, achieves state-of-the-art
performance in multiple benchmarks.

attention has been paid to convex $\varphi$-divergences, such as
Kullback-Leibler, Jeffreys-Kullback, Hellinger, Chi-Square, Renyi, and
I$_{\alpha}$ divergences. While $\varphi$-divergences have been extensively
studied in convex analysis, their use in optimization problems often remains
challenging. In this regard, one of the main shortcomings of existing methods
is that the minimization of $\varphi$-divergences is usually performed with
respect to one of their arguments, possibly within alternating optimization
techniques. In this paper, we overcome this limitation by deriving new
closed-form expressions for the proximity operator of such two-variable
functions. This makes it possible to employ standard proximal methods for
efficiently solving a wide range of convex optimization problems involving
$\varphi$-divergences. In addition, we show that these proximity operators are
useful to compute the epigraphical projection of several functions of practical
interest. The proposed proximal tools are numerically validated in the context
of optimal query execution within database management systems, where the
problem of selectivity estimation plays a central role. Experiments are carried
out on small to large scale scenarios.

excitation power used in experiments. For two-dimensional (2D) semiconductors,
laser excitation effects are anticipated to be vastly different due to
complexity added by their ultimate thinness, high surface to volume ratio, and
laser-membrane interaction effects. We show in this article that under laser

Most surprisingly these effects take place even at low steady state excitation,
which is commonly thought to be non-intrusive. In low temperature
photoluminescence (PL) we show for monolayer (ML) MoSe2 samples grown by
different techniques that laser treatment increases significantly the trion
(i.e. charged exciton) contribution to the emission compared to the neutral
exciton emission. Comparison between samples exfoliated onto different
substrates shows that laser induced doping is more efficient for ML MoSe2 on
SiO2/Si compared to h-BN and gold. For ML MoS2 we show that exposure to laser
radiation with an average power in the $\mu$W/$\mu$m$^2$ range does not just
increase the trion-to-exciton PL emission ratio, but may result in the
irreversible disappearance of the neutral exciton PL emission and a shift of

that self-propelled particles can actually diffuse in either direction with
respect to the wave, depending on its speed and waveform. Moreover, chiral
swimmers, which move along spiraling trajectories, may diffuse preferably in a
direction perpendicular to the active wave. Such a variety of tactic responses
is explained by the modulation of the swimmer's diffusion inside traveling

family $\mathcal{F}$ of subsets of $\{1,2,\dots,n\}$ has size at most \[
|\mathcal{F}|\leq3n\sum_{k\leq

a set $A\subset(\mathbb Z/D \mathbb Z)^{n}=\{1,2,\dots,D\}^{n}$ for $D>2$ is
sunflower-free if every distinct triple $x,y,z\in A$ there exists a coordinate
$i$ where exactly two of $x_{i},y_{i},z_{i}$ are equal. Using a version of the
polynomial method with characters
$\chi:\mathbb{Z}/D\mathbb{Z}\rightarrow\mathbb{C}$ instead of polynomials, we
show that any sunflower-free set $A\subset(\mathbb Z/D \mathbb Z)^{n}$ has size
\[ |A|\leq c_{D}^{n} \] where $c_{D}=\frac{3}{2^{2/3}}(D-1)^{2/3}$. This can be
seen as making further progress on a possible approach to proving the
Erd\H{o}s-Rado sunflower conjecture, which by the work of Alon, Sphilka and
Umans is equivalent to proving that $c_{D}\leq C$ for some constant $C$
independent of $D$.

models are becoming increasingly sophisticated. Despite a need for
population-level inference, animal movement models are still predominantly
developed for individual-level inference. Most efforts to upscale the inference
to the population-level are either post hoc or complicated enough that only the
developer can implement the model. Hierarchical Bayesian models provide an
ideal platform for the development of population-level animal movement models
but can be challenging to fit due to computational limitations or extensive
tuning required. We propose a two-stage procedure for fitting hierarchical
animal movement models to telemetry data. The two-stage approach is
statistically rigorous and allows one to fit individual-level movement models
separately, then resample them using a secondary MCMC algorithm. The primary
advantages of the two-stage approach are that the first stage is easily
parallelizable and the second stage is completely unsupervised, allowing for a
completely automated fitting procedure in many cases. We demonstrate the
two-stage procedure with two applications of animal movement models. The first
application involves a spatial point process approach to modeling telemetry
data and the second involves a more complicated continuous-time discrete-space
animal movement model. We fit these models to simulated data and real telemetry
data arising from a population of monitored Canada lynx in Colorado, USA.

well as through spectral modeling of each system. Our spectral modeling also
provides fundamental parameters for the stars and winds in these systems. The
results on WR 138 provide evidence that it is a binary system which may have
gone through a previous mass-transfer episode to create the WR star. The
separation and position of the stars in the WR 137 system together with
previous results from the IOTA interferometer provides evidence that the binary

this leads to specific poles in the Mellin representation of the correlator.
The sign of the residue at these poles is fixed by unitarity. We consider
solutions consistent with crossing symmetry and this pole structure. We show
that in a certain regime all solutions result in a negative contribution to the
anomalous dimension of twist four operators. The reason behind this is a
positivity property of Mack polynomials that leads to a positivity condition
for the Mellin amplitude. This positivity condition can also be proven by
assuming the correct Regge behaviour for the Mellin amplitude. For large $g^2N$
we recover a tower of solutions in one to one correspondence with local
interactions in a effective field theory in the $AdS$ bulk, with the
appropriate suppression factors, and with definite overall signs. These signs
agree with the signs that would follow from causality constraints on the
effective field theory. The positivity constraints arising from CFT for the
Mellin amplitude take a very similar form to the causality constraint for the

technique for complete characterization of ultrashort laser pulses. In FROG, a
reconstruction algorithm retrieves the pulse from a measured spectrogram, yet
current FROG reconstruction algorithms require and exhibit several restricting
features that weaken FROG performances. For example, the delay step must
correspond to the spectral bandwidth measured with large enough SNR a condition
that limits the temporal resolution of the reconstructed pulse, obscures
measurements of weak broadband pulses, and makes measurement of broadband
mid-IR pulses hard and slow because the spectrograms become huge. We develop a
new approach for FROG reconstruction, based on ptychography (a scanning
coherent diffraction imaging technique), that removes many of the algorithmic
restrictions. The ptychographic reconstruction algorithm is significantly
faster and more robust to noise than current FROG algorithms, which are based
on generalized projections (GP). We demonstrate, numerically and
experimentally, that ptychographic reconstruction works well with very partial
spectrograms, e. g. spectrograms with reduced number of measured delays and
spectrograms that have been substantially spectrally filtered. In addition, we
implement the ptychogrpahic approach to blind second harmonic generation (SHG)
FROG and demonstrate robust and complete characterization of two unknown pulses
from a single measured spectrogram and power spectrum of only one of the
pulses. We believe that the ptychograpy-based approach will become the standard
reconstruction procedure in FROG and related diagnostics methods, allowing
successful reconstructions from so far unreconstructable spectrograms.

A number of recent papers have claimed the discovery of an X-shape
structure in the bulge of our Galaxy in the population of the red clumps.
  AIMS. We endeavor to analyze the stellar density of bulge stars in the same
regions using a different stellar population that is characteristic of the
young bulge ($\lesssim 5$ Gyr). Particularly, we use F0-F5 main-sequence stars
with distances derived through photometric parallax.
  METHODS. We extract these stars from extinction-corrected color-magnitude
diagrams in the near-infrared of VISTA-VVV data in some bulge regions and
calculate the densities along the line of sight. We take the uncertaintity in
the photometric parallax and the contamination of other sources into account,
and we see that these errors do not avoid the detection of a possible double
peak along some lines of sight as expected for a X-shape bulge if it existed.
  RESULTS. Only a single peak in the density distribution along the line of
sight is observed, so apparently there is no X-shape structure for this
population of stars. Nonetheless, the effects of the dispersion of absolute
magnitudes in the selected population might be an alternative explanation,
although in principle these effects are insufficient to explain this lack of
double peak according to our calculations.
  CONCLUSIONS. The results of the present paper do not demonstrate that
previous claims of X-shaped bulge using only red clump stars are incorrect, but
there are apparently some puzzling questions if we want to maintain the
validity of both the red-clump results and the results of this paper.

that a new condition poses effective limitations to their framework and we
provide quantitative predictions of the quality of the one dimensional collapse

often overlooked by current methodologies. In order to grasp the mesoscopic
characteristics of semantical content in written texts, we devised a network

proportion of surviving substructure than, e.g, field galaxies. Due to the
presence of galaxy clusters in relative proximity and their high dark matter
content, they are promising targets for the indirect detection of dark matter
via Gamma-rays. Indeed, dedicated studies of sets of up to 100 clusters have
been made previously, so far with no clear indication of a dark matter signal.
Here we report on Gamma-ray observations of some 26,000 galaxy clusters based
on Pass-7 Fermi Large Area Telescope (LAT) data, with clusters selected from
the Tully 2MASS Groups catalog. None of these clusters is significantly
detected in Gamma-rays, and we present Gamma-ray flux upper limits between 20

  We estimate the dark matter content of each of the clusters in these

analyzing Fermi-LAT data from the directions of the clusters. We set some of
the tightest cluster-based constraints to date on the annihilation of dark
matter particles with masses between 20 GeV and 500 GeV for annihilation to a
gamma-ray line. Our cluster based constraints are not yet as strong as bounds
placed using the Galactic Center, although an uncertainty still exists
regarding the ""boost factor"" from cluster substructure, where we have chosen a
rather conservative value. Our analysis, given this choice of possible boost,
is not yet sensitive enough to fully rule out typical realistic DM candidates,

attention over the years from both physicists and mathematicians. In this paper
we study {\it analytically} a physical system which is composed of massive
scalar fields linearly coupled to a rapidly-rotating Kerr black hole. Using
simple arguments, we first show that the coupled black-hole-scalar-field system
may possess stationary bound-state resonances (stationary scalar `clouds') in
the bounded regime $1<\mu/m\Omega_{\text{H}}<\sqrt{2}$, where $\mu$ and $m$ are
respectively the mass and azimuthal harmonic index of the field, and
$\Omega_{\text{H}}$ is the angular velocity of the black-hole horizon. We then
show explicitly that these two bounds on the dimensionless ratio
$\mu/m\Omega_{\text{H}}$ can be saturated in the asymptotic $m\to\infty$ limit.
In particular, we derive a remarkably simple analytical formula for the
resonance mass spectrum of the stationary bound-state scalar clouds in the
regime $M\mu\gg1$ of large field masses: $\mu_n = \sqrt{2}m \Omega_{\text{H}}
\big[1-{{\pi({\cal R}+n)} \over {m|\ln\tau|}}\big]$, where $\tau$ is the
dimensionless temperature of the rapidly-rotating (near-extremal) black hole,
${\cal R}<1$ is a constant, and $n=0,1,2,...$ is the resonance parameter. In
addition, it is shown that, contrary to the flat-space intuition, the effective
lengths of the scalar field configurations in the curved black-hole spacetime
approach a {\it finite} asymptotic value in the large mass $M\mu\gg1$ limit. In
particular, we prove that in the large mass limit, the characteristic length
scale of the scalar clouds scales linearly with the black-hole temperature.

evolution of galaxies. Our goal is to understand the interplay between AGN
feedback and the interstellar medium in M51, a nearby spiral galaxy with a
modest AGN and a kpc-scale radio jet expanding through the disc of the galaxy.
For that purpose, we combine molecular gas observations in the CO(1-0) and
HCN(1-0) lines from the Plateau de Bure interferometer with archival radio,
X-ray, and optical data. We show that there is a significant scarcity of CO
emission in the ionisation cone, while molecular gas emission tends to
accumulate towards the edges of the cone. The distribution and kinematics of CO
and HCN line emission reveal AGN feedback effects out to r~500pc, covering the
whole extent of the radio jet, with complex kinematics in the molecular gas
which displays strong local variations. We propose that this is the result of
the almost coplanar jet pushing on molecular gas in different directions as it
expands; the effects are more pronounced in HCN than in CO emission, probably
as the result of radiative shocks. Following previous interpretation of the
redshifted molecular line in the central 5"" as caused by a molecular outflow,
we estimate the outflow rates to be Mdot_H2~0.9Msun/yr and
Mdot_dense~0.6Msun/yr, which are comparable to the molecular inflow rates
(~1Msun/yr); gas inflow and AGN feedback could be mutually regulated processes.
The agreement with findings in other nearby radio galaxies suggests that this
is not an isolated case, and probably the paradigm of AGN feedback through
radio jets, at least for galaxies hosting low-luminosity active nuclei.

At fixed mass, low star-forming galaxies tend to have higher metallicity than
high star-forming galaxies. Using a few basic assumptions, we further show that
the gas masses and metallicities required to produce the fundamental
mass--metallicity relation, and its intrinsic scatter, are consistent with
cold-mode accretion predictions obtained from the OWLS hydrodynamical

that cold-mode accretion is responsible for the fundamental mass-metallicity

accretion and the fundamental properties of galaxies.

QSOs. The Herschel sources were selected to match the properties of SMGs. We
determined the sub-arcsecond positions of six Herschel sources with the Very

near-infrared spectroscopy. The QSO sightlines probe transverse proper
distances of 112, 157, and 198 kpc at foreground redshifts of 2.043, 2.515, and
2.184, respectively, which are comparable to the virial radius of the
$\sim10^{13}$ Msun halos expected to host SMGs. High-quality absorption-line
spectroscopy of the QSOs reveals systematically strong HI Lyman-alpha
absorption around all three SMGs, with rest-frame equivalent widths of
$\sim2-3$ \AA. However, none of the three absorbers exhibits compelling
evidence for optically thick HI gas or metal absorption, in contrast to the
dominance of strong neutral absorbers in the CGM of luminous $z \sim 2$ QSOs.
The low covering factor of optically thick HI gas around SMGs tentatively
indicates that SMGs may not have as prominent cool gas reservoirs in their
halos as the co-eval QSOs and that they may inhabit less massive halos than
previously thought.

detecting the effects of quantum gravity. With the success of aLIGO and the
advent of instruments like the SKA and eLISA, the prospects for the discovery
of such PSR-BH binaries are very promising. We argue that PSR-BH binaries can
serve as ready-made testing grounds for proposed resolutions to the black hole
information paradox. We propose using timing signals from a pulsar beam passing
through the region near a black hole event horizon as a probe of quantum
gravitational effects. In particular, we demonstrate that fluctuations of the
geometry outside a black hole lead to an increase in the measured root mean
square deviation of the arrival times of pulsar pulses traveling near the
horizon. This allows for a clear observational test of the nonviolent
nonlocality proposal for black hole information escape. For a series of pulses
traversing the near-horizon region, this model predicts an rms in pulse arrival
times of $\sim30\ \mu$s for a $3 M_\odot$ black hole, $\sim0.3\, $ms for a $30
M_\odot$ black hole, and $\sim40\, $s for Sgr A*. The current precision of
pulse time-of-arrival measurements is sufficient to discern these rms
fluctuations. This work is intended to motivate observational searches for
PSR-BH systems as a means of testing models of quantum gravity.

Three sets of simulations are performed with an improved version of the
smoothed particle hydrodynamics GADGET-3 code. These consider the following:
non-radiative gas, star formation and stellar feedback, and the addition of
feedback by active galactic nuclei (AGN). We select clusters with $M_{500} >
10^{14} M_{\odot} E(z)^{-1}$, mimicking the typical selection of
Sunyaev-Zeldovich samples. This permits to have a mass range large enough to
enable robust fitting of the relations even at $z \sim 2$. The results of the
analysis show a general agreement with observations. The values of the slope of
the mass-gas mass and mass-temperature relations at $z=2$ are 10 per cent lower
with respect to $z=0$ due to the applied mass selection, in the former case,
and to the effect of early merger in the latter. We investigate the impact of
the slope variation on the study of the evolution of the normalization. We
conclude that cosmological studies through scaling relations should be limited
to the redshift range $z=0-1$, where we find that the slope, the scatter, and
the covariance matrix of the relations are stable. The scaling between mass and
$Y_X$ is confirmed to be the most robust relation, being almost independent of
the gas physics. At higher redshifts, the scaling relations are sensitive to
the inclusion of AGNs which influences low-mass systems. The detailed study of
these objects will be crucial to evaluate the AGN effect on the ICM.

to ignore dissenting information. Confirmation bias, indeed, plays a pivotal
role in viral phenomena. Furthermore, the wide availability of content on the
web fosters the aggregation of likeminded people where debates tend to enforce
group polarization. Such a configuration might alter the public debate and thus
the formation of the public opinion. In this paper we provide a mathematical
model to study online social debates and the related polarization dynamics. We
assume the basic updating rule of the Bounded Confidence Model (BCM) and we
develop two variations a) the Rewire with Bounded Confidence Model (RBCM), in
which discordant links are broken until convergence is reached; and b) the
Unbounded Confidence Model, under which the interaction among discordant pairs
of users is allowed even with a negative feedback, either with the rewiring
step (RUCM) or without it (UCM). From numerical simulations we find that the
new models (UCM and RUCM), unlike the BCM, are able to explain the coexistence
of two stable final opinions, often observed in reality. Lastly, we present a
mean field approximation of the newly introduced models.

applications, such as targeted advertising, personalized marketing and
information retrieval. In recent years, the importance of contextual
information has motivated generation of personalized recommendations according
to the available contextual information of users.
  Compared to the traditional systems which mainly utilize users' rating
history, review-based recommendation hopefully provide more relevant results to
users. We introduce a review-based recommendation approach that obtains
contextual information by mining user reviews. The proposed approach relate to
features obtained by analyzing textual reviews using methods developed in
Natural Language Processing (NLP) and information retrieval discipline to
compute a utility function over a given item. An item utility is a measure that
shows how much it is preferred according to user's current context.
  In our system, the context inference is modeled as similarity between the
users reviews history and the item reviews history. As an example application,
we used our method to mine contextual data from customers' reviews of movies
and use it to produce review-based rating prediction. The predicted ratings can
generate recommendations that are item-based and should appear at the
recommended items list in the product page. Our evaluations suggest that our
system can help produce better prediction rating scores in comparison to the
standard prediction methods.

access to new physics that cannot be addressed at high-energy colliders.
However, muons are produced within a broad energy spread unmatched to the
low-energy required. In this paper we outline a phase rotation method to
significantly increase the intensity of low-energy muons. The muons are
produced from a short pulsed proton driver, and develop a time-momentum
correlation in a drift space following production. A series of rf cavities is
used to bunch the muons and phase-energy rotate the bunches to a momentum of
around 100 MeV/c. Then another group of rf cavities is used to decelerate the
muon bunches to low-energy. This obtains ~0.1 muon per 8 GeV proton, which is
significantly higher than currently planned Mu2e experiments, and would enable
a next generation of rare decay searches, and other intense muon beam
applications.

photometric redshift estimation, including comparisons with other methods. We
also explore the efficacy of including galaxy shape information in redshift
estimation. Support vector machines, a type of machine learning, utilize
optimization theory and supervised learning algorithms to construct predictive
models based on the information content of data in a way that can treat
different input features symmetrically.
  Methods: The custom support vector machine package we have developed is
designated SPIDERz and made available to the community. As test data for
evaluating performance and comparison with other methods, we apply SPIDERz to
four distinct data sets: 1) the publicly available portion of the PHAT-1
catalog based on the GOODS-N field with spectroscopic redshifts in the range $z
< 3.6$, 2) 14365 galaxies from the COSMOS bright survey with photometric band
magnitudes, morphology, and spectroscopic redshifts inside $z < 1.4$, 3) 3048
galaxies from the overlap of COSMOS photometry and morphology with 3D-HST
spectroscopy extending to $z < 3.9$, and 4) 2612 galaxies with five-band
photometric magnitudes and morphology from the All-wavelength Extended Groth
Strip International Survey and $z < 1.57$.
  Results: We find that SPIDER-z achieves results competitive with other
empirical packages on the PHAT-1 data, and performs quite well in estimating
redshifts with the COSMOS and AEGIS data, including in the cases of a large
redshift range ($0 < z < 3.9$). We also determine from analyses with both the
COSMOS and AEGIS data that the inclusion of morphological information does not
have a statistically significant benefit for photometric redshift estimation
with the techniques employed here.

review and focus group discussion were conducted. To address the multifaceted
challenges facing RDTs, four key issues for RDTs must be addressed, which are
1) the opportunity to access the new treatment; 2) assessment of outcomes where
clinically validated outcomes may be lacking; 3) patient heterogeneity; and 4)
duration of the study and number of patients required. Our proposed study
design has two stages. Stage 1 distinguishes patients who respond to the
treatment from those who do not respond to the treatment after assigning them
all to the experimental treatment. Stage 2 evaluates the treatment effect
comparatively among patients responded in Stage 1. In addition to treatment
effect evaluation, our design can greatly benefit rare disease patients and
clinical practice by increasing opportunities to access experimental treatments
and by providing relevant information that can be used for tailoring treatments
to certain subgroups, aiding future research in treatment development, and
improving healthcare resource utilization.

titanate (STO) substrate is enhanced by almost an order of magnitude with
respect to bulk FeSe. There is recent experimental evidence suggesting that
this enhancement persists in FeSe/STO nano-islands. More specifically, for
sizes $L \sim 10$ nm, the superconducting gap is a highly non-monotonic
function of $L$ with peaks well above the bulk gap value. This is the expected
behavior only for weakly-coupled metallic superconductors such as Al or Sn.
Here we develop a theoretical formalism to describe these experiments based on
three ingredients: Eliashberg theory of superconductivity in the weak coupling
limit, pairing dominated by forward scattering and periodic orbit theory to
model spectral fluctuations. We obtain an explicit analytical expression for
the size dependence of the gap that describes quantitatively the experimental
results with no free parameters. This is a strong suggestion that
superconductivity in FeSe/STO is mediated by STO phonons. We propose that,
since FeSe/STO is still a weakly coupled superconductor, quantum size effects
can be used to further enhance the bulk critical temperature in this interface.

cholesterol, lipid composition, lipid charge, and lipid phase on the monolayer

Microscopy (AFM) was used to resolve topographical nanodomains and Kelvin Probe
Force Microscopy (KPFM) to resolve electrical surface potential of these
nanodomains in lipid monolayers. Model monolayers composed of

changes nanoscale domain formation, affecting both topography and electrical
surface potential. The molecular basis for differences in electrical surface
potential was addressed with atomistic molecular dynamics (MD). MD simulations
qualitatively match the experimental results, with 100s of mV difference in
electrostatic potential between liquid-disordered bilayer (Ld, less cholesterol

much studied problem exhibiting a logarithmically slow anomalous diffusion due
to the growth of energy barriers with the system size. However, if the
potential is random but periodic, the regime of anomalous diffusion crosses
over to one of normal diffusion once a tracer has diffused over a few periods
of the system. Here we consider a system in which the potential is given by a
Brownian Bridge on a finite interval $(0,L)$ and then periodically repeated
over the whole real line, and study the power spectrum $S(f)$ of the diffusive
process $x(t)$ in such a potential. We show that for most of realizations of
$x(t)$ in a given realization of the potential, the low-frequency behavior is
$S(f) \sim {\cal A}/f^2$, i.e., the same as for standard Brownian motion, and
the amplitude ${\cal A}$ is a disorder-dependent random variable with a finite
support. Focusing on the statistical properties of this random variable, we
determine the moments of ${\cal A}$ of arbitrary, negative or positive order
$k$, and demonstrate that they exhibit a multi-fractal dependence on $k$, and a
rather unusual dependence on the temperature and on the periodicity $L$, which
are supported by atypical realizations of the periodic disorder. We finally
show that the distribution of ${\cal A}$ has a log-normal left tail, and
exhibits an essential singularity close to the right edge of the support, which
is related to the Lifshitz singularity. Our findings are based both on analytic
results and on extensive numerical simulations of the process $x(t)$.

  We present a new CNN accelerator paradigm and an accompanying automated

effects of CC NSIs on the simultaneous measurements of $\theta_{23}$ and
$\delta_{CP}$ in DUNE. The analysis reveals that 3$\sigma $ C.L. measurement of
the correct octant of $\theta_{23}$ in the standard mixing scenario is spoiled
if the CC NSIs are taken into account. Likewise, the CC NSIs can deteriorate
the uncertainty of the $\delta_{CP}$ measurement by a factor of two relative to
that in the standard oscillation scenario. We also show that the source and the
detector CC NSIs can induce a significant amount of fake CP-violation and the
CP-conserving case can be excluded by more than 80\% C.L. in the presence of
fake CP-violation. We further find the potential of DUNE to constrain the

of the stochastic volatility factor given the spot value. This leads to a SDE

approximation of the conditional expectation, as presented by Guyon and
Henry-Labord\`ere (2011), provide an efficient calibration procedure even if
some calibration errors may appear when the range of the stochastic volatility
factor is very large. But so far, no global existence result is available for
the SDE nonlinear in the sense of McKean. In the particular case where the
local volatility function is equal to the inverse of the root conditional mean
square of the stochastic volatility factor multiplied by the spot value given
this value and the interest rate is zero, the solution to the SDE is a fake
Brownian motion. When the stochastic volatility factor is a constant (over
time) random variable taking finitely many values and the range of its square
is not too large, we prove existence to the associated Fokker-Planck equation.
Thanks to Figalli (2008), we then deduce existence of a new class of fake
Brownian motions. We then extend these results to the special case of the LSV
model called regime switching local volatility, where the stochastic volatility
factor is a jump process taking finitely many values and with jump intensities
depending on the spot level. Under the same condition on the range of its
square, we prove existence to the associated Fokker-Planck PDE. Finally, we
deduce existence of the calibrated model by extending the results in Figalli

fields in galaxies, and has been confirmed over a large range of far-infrared
luminosities. Recent investigations indicate that it may even hold in the
regime of local dwarf galaxies, and we explore here the expected behavior in
the regime of star formation surface densities below 0.1 M_sun kpc^{-2}
yr^{-1}. We derive two conditions that can be particularly relevant for
inducing a change in the expected correlation: a critical star formation
surface density to maintain the correlation between star formation rate and the
magnetic field, and a critical star formation surface density below which
cosmic ray diffusion losses dominate over their injection via supernova
explosions. For rotation periods shorter than 1.5x10^7 (H/kpc)^2 yrs, with H
the scale height of the disk, the first correlation will break down before
diffusion losses are relevant, as higher star formation rates are required to
maintain the correlation between star formation rate and magnetic field
strength. For high star formation surface densities Sigma_SFR, we derive a
characteristic scaling of the non-thermal radio to the far-infrared / infrared
emission with Sigma_SFR^{1/3}, corresponding to a scaling of the non-thermal
radio luminosity L_s with the infrared luminosity L_{th} as L_{th}^{4/3}. The
latter is expected to change when the above processes are no longer steadily
maintained. In the regime of long rotation periods, we expect a transition
towards a steeper scaling with Sigma_SFR^{2/3}, implying L_s~L_th^{5/3}, while
the regime of fast rotation is expected to show a considerably enhanced
scatter. These scaling relations explain the increasing thermal fraction of the
radio emission observed within local dwarfs, and can be tested with future
observations by the SKA and its precursor radio telescopes.

for more than a decade. However, state-of-the-art techniques fall short of

novel formalization of Internet routing, and apply this model to routing
anomalies in order to establish a comprehensive attacker model. We use this
model to precisely classify attacks and to evaluate their impact and
detectability. We analyze the eligibility of attack tactics that suit an
attacker's goals and demonstrate that related work mostly focuses on less
impactful kinds of attacks.
  We further propose, implement and test the Hijacking Event Analysis Program
(HEAP), a new approach to investigate hijacking alarms. Our approachis designed
to seamlessly integrate with previous work in order to reduce the high rates of
false alarms inherent to these techniques. We leverage several unique data
sources that can reliably disprove malicious intent. First, we make use of an
Internet Routing Registry to derive business or organisational relationships
between the parties involved in an event. Second, we use a topology-based
reasoning algorithm to rule out events caused by legitimate operational
practice. Finally, we use Internet-wide network scans to identify
SSL/TLS-enabled hosts, which helps to identify non-malicious events by
comparing public keys prior to and during an event. In our evaluation, we prove
the effectiveness of our approach, and show that day-to-day routing anomalies
are harmless for the most part. More importantly, we use HEAP to assess the
validity of publicly reported alarms. We invite researchers to interface with
HEAP in order to cross-check and narrow down their hijacking alerts.

local amplitude, the local attenuation and modified differential phase
congruency methods. The monogenic scale-space is obtained from a known image by
Poisson and conjugate Poisson filtering. In mathematics, it is the Hardy space
in the upper half-space. The boundary value of the monogenic scale-space
representation is a monogenic image. In the monogenic scale-space, the
definitions involving scale, such as local amplitude,local attenuation, local
phase angle, local phase vector and local frequency (phase derivatives) are
proposed. Using Clifford analysis, the relations between the local attenuation
and the local phase vector are obtained. These study will be improved the

results are shown by using some typical images.

that use high-dimensional data. A typical example is to find the most useful
genes that are related to a certain disease (eg, cancer) from high-dimensional
gene expressions. The expressions of genes have grouping structures, for
example, a group of co-regulated genes that have similar biological functions
tend to have similar expressions. Many statistical methods have been proposed
to take the grouping structure into consideration in feature selection,
including group LASSO, supervised group LASSO, and regression on group
representatives. In this paper, we propose a fully Bayesian Robit regression
method with heavy-tailed (sparsity) priors (shortened by FBRHT) for selecting
features with grouping structure. The main features of FBRHT include that it
discards more aggressively unrelated features than LASSO, and it can make
feature selection within groups automatically without a pre-specified grouping
structure. In this paper, we use simulated and real datasets to demonstrate
that the predictive power of the sparse feature subsets selected by FBRHT are
comparable with other much larger feature subsets selected by LASSO, group
LASSO, supervised group LASSO, penalized logistic regression and random forest,
and that the succinct feature subsets selected by FBRHT have significantly
better predictive power than the feature subsets of the same size taken from
the top features selected by the aforementioned methods.

problem, which minimizes the sum of a self-concordant function $f$ and a
(possibly nonsmooth) proper closed convex function $g$. The CSC minimization is
the cornerstone of the path-following interior point methods for solving a
broad class of convex optimization problems. It has also found numerous
applications in machine learning. The proximal damped Newton (PDN) methods have
been well studied in the literature for solving this problem that enjoy a nice
iteration complexity. Given that at each iteration these methods typically
require evaluating or accessing the Hessian of $f$ and also need to solve a
proximal Newton subproblem, the cost per iteration can be prohibitively high
when applied to large-scale problems. Inspired by the recent success of block
coordinate descent methods, we propose a randomized block proximal damped
Newton (RBPDN) method for solving the CSC minimization. Compared to the PDN
methods, the computational cost per iteration of RBPDN is usually significantly
lower. The computational experiment on a class of regularized logistic
regression problems demonstrate that RBPDN is indeed promising in solving
large-scale CSC minimization problems. The convergence of RBPDN is also
analyzed in the paper. In particular, we show that RBPDN is globally convergent
when $g$ is Lipschitz continuous. It is also shown that RBPDN enjoys a local
linear convergence. Moreover, we show that for a class of $g$ including the
case where $g$ is Lipschitz differentiable, RBPDN enjoys a global linear
convergence. As a striking consequence, it shows that the classical damped
Newton methods [22,40] and the PDN [31] for such $g$ are globally linearly
convergent, which was previously unknown in the literature. Moreover, this
result can be used to sharpen the existing iteration complexity of these
methods.

this paper we present a practical approximate solution for slow mutation rates

method of solution relies on parameterising the general non-reversible rate

quaternion differential equations (QDEs) which extend the ordinary differential
equations. The theory of QDEs was recently well established and it has wide
applications in physics and life science. This paper establishes a systematic
frame work for the theory of linear quaternion dynamic equations on time scales
(QDETS), which can be applied to wave phenomena modeling, fluid dynamics and
filter design. The algebraic structure of the solutions to the QDETS is
actually a left- or right- module, not a linear vector space. On the
non-commutativity of the quaternion algebra, many concepts and properties of
the classical dynamic equations on time scales (DETS) can not be applied. They
should be redefined accordingly. Using $q$-determinant, a novel definition of
Wronskian is introduced under the framework of quaternions which is different
from the standard one in DETS. Liouville's formula for QDETS is also analyzed.
Upon these, the solutions to the linear QDETS are established. The Putzer's
algorithms to evaluate the fundamental solution matrix for homogeneous QDETS
are presented. Furthermore, the variation of constants formula to solve the
nonhomogeneous QDETs is given. Some concrete examples are provided to
illustrate the feasibility of the proposed algorithms.

predictive models of continuous data that fits the data with an additive
non-parametric model. The classic version of gradient boosting assumes that the
data is independent and identically distributed. However, relational data with
interdependent, linked instances is now common and the dependencies in such
data can be exploited to improve predictive performance. Collective inference
is one approach to exploit relational correlation patterns and significantly
reduce classification error. However, much of the work on collective learning
and inference has focused on discrete prediction tasks rather than continuous.
%target values has not got that attention in terms of collective inference. In
this work, we investigate how to combine these two paradigms together to
improve regression in relational domains. Specifically, we propose a boosting
algorithm for learning a collective inference model that predicts a continuous
target variable. In the algorithm, we learn a basic relational model,
collectively infer the target values, and then iteratively learn relational
models to predict the residuals. We evaluate our proposed algorithm on a real
network dataset and show that it outperforms alternative boosting methods.
However, our investigation also revealed that the relational features interact
together to produce better predictions.

nonrelativistic analog does not exist. Instead we propose two
causality-preserving positive operator-valued measures (POVMs) that are based
on projections onto one-particle and antiparticle spaces, and on the normalized
energy density. They predict identical expectation values for position. The
variances differ by less than a quarter of the squared de Broglie wavelength
and coincide in the nonrelativistic limit. Since the resulting statistical
moment operators are not canonical conjugates of momentum, the Heisenberg
uncertainty relations need not hold. Indeed, the energy density POVM leads to a
lower uncertainty. We reformulate the standard equations of the spin dynamics
by explicitly considering the charge-independent acceleration, allowing a
consistent treatment of backreaction and inclusion of a weak gravitational
field.

bridge regulation and metabolism in a transparent way under the principle of

differences on almost half of the tweets gathered. The effectiveness of
TensiStrength depends on the nature of the tweets classified, with tweets that

calculations are performed to the first order in the electron-nucleus mass
ratio and to all orders in the nuclear binding strength parameter $Z\alpha$
(where $Z$ is the nuclear charge number and $\alpha$ is the fine structure
constant). The obtained results provide accurate predictions for the
higher-order remainder beyond the known $Z\alpha$-expansion terms. In the case
of hydrogen, the remainder was found to be much larger than anticipated. This
result resolves the previously reported disagreement between the numerical
all-order and the analytical $Z\alpha$-expansion approaches for the nuclear
recoil effect in the hydrogen Lamb shift.

to tensor contractions that mirrors the design of a high-performance general
matrix-matrix multiplication (GEMM). The critical insight behind GETT is the
identification of three index sets, involved in the tensor contraction, which
enable us to systematically reduce an arbitrary tensor contraction to loops
around a highly tuned ""macro-kernel"". This macro-kernel operates on suitably
prepared (""packed"") sub-tensors that reside in a specified level of the cache
hierarchy. In contrast to previous approaches to tensor contractions, GETT
exhibits desirable features such as unit-stride memory accesses,
cache-awareness, as well as full vectorization, without requiring auxiliary
memory. To compare our technique with other modern tensor contractions, we
integrate GETT alongside the so called Transpose-Transpose-GEMM-Transpose and
Loops-over-GEMM approaches into an open source ""Tensor Contraction Code
Generator"" (TCCG). The performance results for a wide range of tensor
contractions suggest that GETT has the potential of becoming the method of
choice: While GETT exhibits excellent performance across the board, its
effectiveness for bandwidth-bound tensor contractions is especially impressive,
outperforming existing approaches by up to $12.4\times$. More precisely, GETT
achieves speedups of up to $1.41\times$ over an equivalent-sized GEMM for
bandwidth-bound tensor contractions while attaining up to $91.3\%$ of peak
floating-point performance for compute-bound tensor contractions.

novel proof techniques. Using our techniques, we are also able to provide the
first efficient and provably consistent estimator for the robust regression

the unique advantage of being independent of antenna-based calibration terms.
We employ realistic, large area sky models from Sims et al. (2016). These
include an estimate of the HI 21cm signal generated using 21cm FAST, plus
continuum models of both the diffuse Galactic synchrotron emission and the
extragalactic point sources. We employ the CASA simulator and adopt the
Dillon-Parsons HERA configuration to generate a uv measurement set. We then use
AIPS to calculate the closure phases as a function of frequency ('closure
spectra'), and python scripts for subsequent analysis. We find that the closure
spectra for the HI signal show dramatic structure in frequency, and based on
thermal noise alone, the redundant HERA-331 array should detect these
fluctuations easily. Comparatively, the frequency structure in the continuum
closure spectra is much smoother than that seen in the HI closure spectra.
Unfortunately, when the line and continuum signals are combined, the continuum
dominates the visibilities at the level of 10^3 to 10^4, and the line signal is
lost. We have investigated fitting and removing smooth curves in frequency to
the line plus continuum closure spectra, and find that the continuum itself
shows enough structure in frequency in the closure spectra to preclude
separation of the continuum and line based on such a process. We have also
considered the subtraction of the continuum from the visibilities using a sky
model, prior to calculation of the closure spectra. TRUNCATED.

purely scientific aspects of logic and the way it is practiced and applied. He
often expressed distaste for nonstandard models, and made a sustained effort to

syntactic vs semantic distinction. He felt that these were vague, and sought to
replace them all by his polyadic algebra. Halmos claimed that Robinson's

circumstellar disk of the LMC B[e] supergiant LHA 120-S 73. High-resolution
optical and near-IR spectroscopic data were obtained over a period of 16 and 7
years, respectively. The spectra cover the diagnostic emission lines from
[CaII] and [OI], as well as the CO bands. These features trace the disk at
different distances from the star. We analyzed the kinematics of the individual
emission regions by modeling their emission profiles. A low-resolution
mid-infrared spectrum was obtained as well, which provides information on the
composition of the dusty disk. All diagnostic emission features display
double-peaked line profiles, which we interpret as due to Keplerian rotation.
We find that LHA 120-S 73 is surrounded by at least four individual rings of
material with alternating densities (or by a disk with strongly non-monotonic
radial density distribution). Moreover, we find that the molecular ring must
have gaps or at least strong density inhomogeneities, or in other words, a
clumpy structure. The mid-infrared spectrum displays features of oxygen- and
carbon-rich grain species, which indicates a long-lived, stable dusty disk. We
cannot confirm the previously reported high value for the stellar rotation
velocity. The line profile of HeI 5876 A is strongly variable in both width and
shape and resembles of those seen in non-radially pulsating stars. A proper
determination of the real underlying stellar rotation velocity is hence not
possible. The existence of multiple stable and clumpy rings of alternating
density recalls ring structures around planets. Although there is currently
insufficient observational evidence, it is tempting to propose a scenario with
one (or more) minor bodies or planets revolving around LHA 120-S 73 and
stabilizing the ring system, in analogy to the shepherd moons in planetary

comparing site fractions in Gd-poor and Gd-rich GdAl2(Ag) samples. Interaction
enthalpies between solute-atom pairs were determined from temperature

for close-neighbor complexes In/Gd/+Ag/Gd/ and In/Gd/+Ag/Al/ pairs, whereas a
slightly attractive interaction was observed for In/Al/+Ag/Al/. Interaction
enthalpies were all in the range +/- 0.15 eV. Temperature dependences of site
fractions of In-probes on locally defect-free Gd- and Al-sites yields a
transfer enthalpy that was found to be 0.343 eV in a previous study of undoped
GdAl2. The corresponding values in GdAl2(Ag) samples are much smaller. This is
attributed to competition of In- and Ag-solutes to occupy sites of the same
sublattice. While the difference in site-enthalpies of In-solutes on Gd- and
Al-sites is temperature independent, it is proposed that the transfer of
Ag-solutes from Gd- to Al-sites leads to a large temperature dependence of
degeneracies of levels available to In-solutes, resulting in an effective
transfer enthalpy that is much smaller than the difference in site-enthalpies.

studied as a function of alloy composition and temperature using perturbed

signals were detected and their equilibrium site fractions were measured up to
700 oC. Two signals have well-defined electric field gradients (EFGs) and are
attributed to In-probes on Gd- and Ni-sites in a well-ordered lattice. A third,
inhomogeneously broadened signal was observed at low temperature. This is
attributed to trapping, or segregation, of In-probes to lattice sinks such as
grain boundaries (GB) that have a large multiplicity of local environments and
EFGs. Changes in site fractions were reversible above 300oC. Measurements were
made on a pair of samples that were richer and poorer in Gd. Remarkably, the
GB-site was populated only in the more Gd-rich sample. This is explained by the
hypothesis that excess Gd segregates to the grain boundaries and provides a
lower enthalpy environment for In-probe atoms. Observations are discussed in
relation to a three-level quantum system. Enthalpy differences between levels
were determined from measurements of temperature dependences of ratios of site
fractions. The enthalpy of transfer of In-probes from the Gd- to Ni-sublattice
was found to be much smaller in the Gd-rich sample. This is attributed to a
large temperature-dependence in the degeneracies of levels available to
In-solutes in the phase, leading to an effective transfer enthalpy that differs
greatly from the difference in site-enthalpies. A possible scenario is
discussed. Different segregation enthalpies were measured for In-solute
transferring from GB sites to Gd- and Ni-sites, whereas only an average value
can be determined through macroscopic measurements.

from the merging of two carbon-oxygen white dwarfs (CO WDs). Meanwhile, recent
hydrodynamical simulations have indicated that the accretion-induced collapse
may be avoided under certain conditions when double WDs merge violently.
However, the properties of SNe Ia from this violent merger scenario are highly
dependent on a particular mass-accretion stage, the so-called WD + He subgiant
channel, during which the primary WD is able to increase its mass by accreting
He-rich material from a He subgiant before the systems evolves into a double WD
system. In this article, we aim to study this particular evolutionary stage
systematically and give the properties of violent WD mergers. By employing the
Eggleton stellar evolution code, we followed a large number of binary
calculations and obtained the regions in parameter space for producing violent
mergers based on the WD + He subgiant channel. According to these simulations,
we found that the primary WDs can increase their mass by ~0.10-0.45 Msun during
the mass-accretion stage. We then conducted a series of binary population
synthesis calculations and found that the Galactic SN Ia birthrate from this
channel is about 0.01-0.4*10-3 yr-1. This suggests that the violent WD mergers
from this channel may only contribute to ~0.3%-10% of all SNe Ia in our Galaxy.
The delay times of violent WD mergers from this channel are >1.7 Gyr,
contributing to the SNe Ia in old populations. We also found that the WD + He
subgiant channel is the dominent way for producing violent WD mergers that may
be able to eventually explode as SNe Ia.

routes and facility design in many countries. This paper investigates
pedestrian movement properties of crowd with different age compositions. Three
pedestrian groups are considered: young student group, old people group and
mixed group. It is found that traffic jams occur more frequently in mixed group
due to the great differences of mobilities and self-adaptive abilities among
pedestrians. The jams propagate backward with a velocity 0.4 m/s for global
density around 1.75 m-1 and 0.3 m/s for higher than 2.3 m-1. The fundamental
diagrams of the three groups are obviously different from each other and cannot
be unified into one diagram by direct non-dimensionalization. Unlike previous
studies, three linear regimes in mixed group but only two regimes in young
student group are observed in the headway-velocity relation, which is also
verified in the fundamental diagram. Different ages and mobilities of
pedestrians in a crowd cause the heterogeneity of system and influence the
properties of pedestrian dynamics significantly. It indicates that the density
is not the only factor leading to jams in pedestrian traffic. The composition
of crowd has to be considered in understanding pedestrian dynamics and facility
design.

mass threshold comparable with our Galaxy must be assumed in galaxy formation
to get a reasonably large probability of finding the observed small value,
$P(<$$\Lambda_{\rm obs})$, though stars are found in much smaller galaxies as
well. Here we examine the anthropic argument by using a semi-analytic model of
cosmological galaxy formation, which can reproduce many observations such as
galaxy luminosity functions. We calculate the probability distribution of
$\Lambda$ by running the model code for a wide range of $\Lambda$, while other
cosmological parameters and model parameters for baryonic processes of galaxy
formation are kept constant. Assuming that the prior probability distribution
is flat per unit $\Lambda$, and that the number of observers is proportional to
stellar mass, we find $P(<$$\Lambda_{\rm obs}) = 6.7 \%$ without introducing
any galaxy mass threshold. We also investigate the effect of metallicity; we
find $P(<$$\Lambda_{\rm obs}) = 9.0 \%$ if observers exist only in galaxies
whose metallicity is higher than the solar abundance. If the number of
observers is proportional to metallicity, we find $P(<$$\Lambda_{\rm obs}) =
9.7 \%$. Since these probabilities are not extremely small, we conclude that
the anthropic argument is a viable explanation, if the value of $\Lambda$
observed in our universe is determined by a probability distribution.

this paper, we present a theoretical analysis of such scenarios based on the

polymer fluctuations and model the molecule as a rigid charged line. At
strongly charged membranes, the adsorbed counterions enhance the screening
ability of the interfacial region. In the presence of highly charged polymers
such as double-stranded DNA molecules close to the membrane, this enhanced
interfacial screening dominates the mean-field level DNA-membrane repulsion and
results in the adsorption of the DNA molecule to the surface. This picture
provides a simple explanation for the recently observed DNA binding onto
similarly charged substrates [G. L.-Caballero et al., Soft Matter 10, 2805

model with density stratification, for general meshes and collocated variables.
The proposed strategy is based on a regularized model where the transport
velocity in the advective fluxes is shifted proportionally to the pressure
potential gradient. Using a similar strategy for the potential forces, we show
the stability of the method in the sense of a discrete dissipation of the
mechanical energy, in general multilayer and non-linear frames. These results
are obtained at first-order in space and time and extended using a simple
second-order MUSCL extension. With the objective of minimizing the diffusive
losses in realistic contexts, sufficient conditions are exhibited on the
regularizing terms to ensure the scheme's linear stability at first and
second-order in time and space. The other main result stands in the consistency
with respect to the asymptotics reached at small and large time scales in low
Froude regimes, which governs large-scale oceanic circulation. Additionally,
robustness and well-balanced results for motionless steady states are also
ensured. These stability properties tend to provide a very robust and efficient
approach, easy to implement and particularly well suited for large-scale
simulations. Some numerical experiments are proposed to highlight the scheme
efficiency: an experiment of fast gravitational modes, a smooth surface wave
propagation, an initial propagating surface water elevation jump considering a
non trivial topography, and a last experiment of slow Rossby modes simulating
the displacement of a baroclinic vortex subject to the Coriolis force.

GeV, and the potential for upgrades into the TeV region. The ILC will fully
explore the Higgs sector, including model-independent coupling and width
measurements, direct measurements of the coupling to the top quark and the
Higgs self-coupling, enable precision measurements of top quark properties and
couplings as well as other electroweak precision measurements and provide
extensive discovery potential for new physics complementary to the capabilities
of hadron colliders. This paper will give an overview of the physics case of
the ILC, put in context of the running scenario covering different
centre-of-mass energies, and discuss the current status and perspectives of
this global facility.

collisions that includes associated jet production up to two jets has been
developed using a subtraction method based on the LLL subtraction. The parton
shower (PS) simulation to restore the subtracted divergent components involves
both QED and QCD radiation, and QED radiation at very small $Q^{2}$ are
simulated by referring to a fragmentation function (FF). The PS/FF simulation
has the ability to enforce the radiation of a given number of energetic
photons. The generated events can be fed to PYTHIA to obtain particle
(hadron)-level event information, which enables us to perform realistic
simulations of photon isolation and hadron-jet reconstruction. The simulated
events, in which the loop-mediated $gg \rightarrow \gamma\gamma$ process is
involved, reasonably reproduce the diphoton kinematics measured at the LHC.
Using the developed simulation, we found that the 2-jet processes significantly
contribute to diphoton production. A large 2-jet contribution can be considered
as a common feature in electroweak-boson production in hadron collisions
although the reason is yet to be understood. Discussion concerning the
treatment of the underlying events in photon isolation is necessary for future
higher precision measurements.

models where a database is stored across several servers using coding
techniques from distributed storage, rather than being simply replicated. In
particular, a recent breakthrough result of Fazelli, Vardy and Yaakobi
introduces the notion of a PIR code and a PIR array code, and uses this notion
to produce efficient PIR protocols.
  In this paper we are interested in designing PIR array codes. We consider the
case when we have $m$ servers, with each server storing a fraction $(1/s)$ of
the bits of the database; here $s$ is a fixed rational number with $s > 1$. A
PIR array code with the $k$-PIR property enables a $k$-server PIR protocol
(with $k\leq m$) to be emulated on $m$ servers, with the overall storage
requirements of the protocol being reduced. The communication complexity of a
PIR protocol reduces as $k$ grows, so the virtual server rate, defined to be
$k/m$, is an important parameter. We study the maximum virtual server rate of a
PIR array code with the $k$-PIR property. We present upper bounds on the
achievable virtual server rate, some constructions, and ideas how to obtain PIR
array codes with the highest possible virtual server rate. In particular, we
present constructions that asymptotically meet our upper bounds, and the exact
largest virtual server rate is obtained when $1 < s \leq 2$.
  A $k$-PIR code (and similarly a $k$-PIR array code) is also a locally
repairable code with symbol availability $k-1$. Such a code ensures $k$
parallel reads for each information symbol. So the virtual server rate is very
closely related to the symbol availability of the code when used as a locally
repairable code. The results of this paper are discussed also in this context,
where subspace codes also have an important role.

to set up the cosmological Bell violating test experiment we introduce a model
independent theoretical framework using which we have studied the creation of
new massive particles by implementing the WKB approximation method for the

Next using the background scalar fluctuation in presence of new time dependent
mass contribution, we explicitly compute the expression for the one point and
two point correlation functions. Furthermore, using the results for one point
function we introduce a new theoretical cosmological parameter which can be
expressed in terms of the other known inflationary observables and can also be
treated as a future theoretical probe to break the degeneracy amongst various
models of inflation. Additionally, we also fix the scale of inflation in a
model independent way without any prior knowledge of primordial gravitational
waves. Next, we also comment on the technicalities of measurements from isospin
breaking interactions and the future prospects of newly introduced massive
particles in cosmological Bell violating test experiment. Further, we cite a

The relation to the commonly used dipole approach is discussed. We conclude and
illustrate that some results of the dipole approaches are too approximate, as
far as kinemtics is considered, and in fact cannot be used for real
experiments. We find that the dipole formula is valid only in very
forward/backward rapidity regions ($|y| >$ 5). Some differential cross sections
for low-mass dilepton production are shown and compared to the LHCb and ATLAS
experimental data. In distinction to dipole approaches, we include four
Drell-Yan structure functions (the impact of interference structure functions
is rather small for typical experimental cuts). We find that both side
contributions ($g q/\bar q$ and $q/\bar q g$) have to be included even for the

  representation in the bit-probe model","12 pages, 4 figures",,,,"cs.CC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We present the first linear lower bound for the number of bits required to be
accessed in the worst case to increment an integer in an arbitrary space-
optimal binary representation. The best previously known lower bound was
logarithmic. It is known that a logarithmic number of read bits in the worst
case is enough to increment some of the integer representations that use one
bit of redundancy, therefore we show an exponential gap between space-optimal
and redundant counters.
  Our proof is based on considering the increment procedure for a space optimal
counter as a permutation and calculating its parity. For every space optimal
counter, the permutation must be odd, and implementing an odd permutation
requires reading at least half the bits in the worst case. The combination of
these two observations explains why the worst-case space-optimal problem is
substantially different from both average-case approach with constant expected
number of reads and almost space optimal representations with logarithmic
number of reads in the worst case.

framework for the (constrained) minimization of the sum of a smooth (possibly
nonconvex and nonseparable) function, i.e., the agents' sum-utility, plus a
convex (possibly nonsmooth and nonseparable) regularizer. The latter is usually
employed to enforce some structure in the solution, typically sparsity. The
proposed method hinges on Successive Convex Approximation (SCA) techniques
coupled with i) a tracking mechanism instrumental to locally estimate the
gradients of agents' cost functions; and ii) a novel broadcast protocol to
disseminate information and distribute the computation among the agents.
Asymptotic convergence to stationary solutions is established. A key feature of
the proposed algorithm is that it neither requires the double-stochasticity of
the consensus matrices (but only column stochasticity) nor the knowledge of the
graph sequence to implement. To the best of our knowledge, the proposed
framework is the first broadcast-based distributed algorithm for convex and
nonconvex constrained optimization over arbitrary, time-varying digraphs.
Numerical results show that our algorithm outperforms current schemes on both

GMRES to focus on eigenvalues that otherwise slow convergence; for general

restarted GMRES often settles. The eigenvectors of matrices derived from

magnetized tunnel junctions of diameters from 50 to 250 nm in the thermally
activated regime. When the field and the spin-torque concur to favor the P to
AP transition, the reversal yields monotonic resistance ramps that can be
interpreted as a domain wall propagation through the device at velocities of 17
to 30 nm/ns; smaller cells switch hence faster. When the field hinders the P to
AP transition, the switching is preceded by repetitive switching attempts,
during which the resistance transiently increases until successful reversal
occurs. At 50 nm, the P to AP switching proceeds reproducibly in 3 ns, with a
monotonic increase of the device resistance. In the reverse transition (AP to
P), several reversal paths are possible even in the smallest junctions.
Besides, the non uniform nature of the response seems still present at
nanoscale, with sometimes electrical signatures of strong disorder during the
reversal. The AP to P transition is preceded by a strong instability of the AP
state in devices above 100 nm. The resistance becomes extremely agitated before
switching to P in a path yielding a slow (20-50 ns) irregular increase of the
conductance with variability. Unreversed bubbles of 60 nm can persist a few
microseconds in the largest junctions. The complexity of the AP to P switching
is reduced but not suppressed when the junctions are downsized below 60 nm. The
instability of the initial AP state is no longer detected but the other
features remain. In the smallest junctions (50 nm) we occasionally observe much
faster (sub-1 ns) switching events. We discuss the origin of the switching
asymmetry and its size dependence, with an emphasis on the role of the non
uniformities of the stray field emanating from the reference layers, which
affects the zones in which nucleation is favored.

projective measurements are not optimal with respect to the joint-measurement

notion of valuation of a multivariate polynomial at a point. However a gap in
one of the key supporting results for his proof was subsequently noticed. In
the present paper we provide a complete validity proof of Lazard's method. Our
proof is based on the classical parametrized version of Puiseux's theorem and
basic properties of Lazard's valuation. This result is significant because
Lazard's method can be applied to any finite family of polynomials, without any
assumption on the system of coordinates. It therefore has wider applicability
and may be more efficient than other projection and lifting schemes for CAD.

observations of the cataclysmic variable star (hereafter CVs) V455 Andromedae,
belonging to the WZ Sge sub-class, in quiescence. Using the spectroscopic data
we computed time-resolved Doppler tomograms of the system demonstrating its
behavior at different orbital phases. In the tomograms one can see the periodic
brightening of different regions within one orbital cycle. We interpret this
brightening as being due to the interaction of four phase-locked shock waves in
the disk with a specific internal precessing density wave that develops inside
the disk, because of the tidal influence of the secondary star, and this
density wave propagates up to the disk's outer regions. When the outer part of
the density wave in its precessional motion reaches a shock wave the local
density grows, which amplifies the shock (by increasing $\rho V^{2}/2$). This
results in an additional energy release in the shock and can be observed as a
brightening. Analysis of the tomographic results and the photometric data shows
that two main sources contribute to the light curves of the system: the
radiation of the ""hot line"" and the bow-shock gives us two major orbital humps,
located approximately at the orbital phases $\phi=0.25$ and $\phi=0.75$; the
amplification of the four shock waves may give us up to four ""superhumps""
shifting over the light curve with the precessional period. These two effects,
when overlapping, change the shape of the light curves, shift the hump maxima,
and they sometimes produce more than two humps in the light curve. We should
emphasize that when saying ""superhumps"" we imply an effect that is observed in
quiescent light curves of WZ Sge stars, as opposed to ""classical"" superhumps
usually observed in outbursts.

Experimental results, based on a dataset of 48 annotated chest CTs, show that
the deep learning model produces a mean 5-year mortality prediction accuracy of

  Vulnerability of DNS Recursive Servers",,,,,"cs.CR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Parallelization is featured by DNS recursive servers to do time-consuming
recursions on behalf on clients. As common DNS configurations, recursive
servers should allow a reasonable timeout for each recursion which may take as
long as several seconds. However, it is proposed in this paper that recursion
parallelization may be exploited by attackers to compromise the recursion
timeout mechanism for the purpose of DoS or DDoS attacks. Attackers can have
recursive servers drop early existing recursions in service by saturating
recursion parallelization. The key of the proposed attack model is to reliably
prolong service times for any attacking queries. As means of prolong service
times, serval techniques are proposed to effectively avoiding cache hit and
prolonging overall latency of external DNS lookups respectively. The impacts of
saturated recursion parallelization on timeout are analytically provided. The
testing on BIND servers demonstrates that with carefully crafted queries, an
attacker can use a low or moderate level of query load to successfully
overwhelm a target recursive server from serving the legitimate clients.

limit of centrifugal instability (CI) in unstratified inviscid Taylor-Couette
flow, for both axisymmetric and non-axisymmetric modes. Non-axisymmetric
stratorotational instability (SRI) is known to set in for anticyclonic rotation
ratios beyond that line, i.e. $\eta^2<\mu<1$ for axially stably-stratified
Taylor-Couette flow, but the competition between CI and SRI in the range
$\mu<\eta^2$ has not yet been addressed. In this paper, we establish continuous
connections between the two instabilities at finite Reynolds number Re, as
previously suggested by M. Le Bars & P. Le Gal, Phys. Rev. Lett. 99, 064502
(2007), making them indistinguishable at onset. Both instabilities are also
continuously connected to the radiative instability at finite Re. These results
demonstrate the complex impact viscosity has on the linear stability properties
of this flow. Several other qualitative differences with inviscid theory were
found, among which the instability of a non-axisymmetric mode localized at the
outer cylinder without stratification, and the instability of a mode
propagating against the inner cylinder rotation with stratification. The
combination of viscosity and stratification can also lead to a `collision'
between (axisymmetric) Taylor vortex branches, causing the axisymmetric
oscillatory state already observed in past experiments. Perhaps more surprising
is the instability of a centrifugal-like helical mode beyond the Rayleigh line,
caused by the joint effects of stratification and viscosity. The threshold
$\mu=\eta^2$ seems to remain, however, an impassable instability limit for
axisymmetric modes, regardless of stratification, viscosity, and even
disturbance amplitude.

even for the case that the points are exactly the vertices of a simple polygon
and the obstacle is the complement of the polygon-the simple-polygon visibility

bounded component of the complement of the visibility drawing, whereas an
outside obstacle lies in the unbounded component.
  We show that the class of graphs with an inside-obstacle representation is

circumference at most 6 has an outside-obstacle representation, which does not
hold for a specific graph with 8 vertices and circumference 8. Finally, we

  Applications to Systemic Risk",,,,,"math.ST econ.EM stat.TH","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We propose two types of Quantile Graphical Models (QGMs) --- Conditional
Independence Quantile Graphical Models (CIQGMs) and Prediction Quantile
Graphical Models (PQGMs). CIQGMs characterize the conditional independence of
distributions by evaluating the distributional dependence structure at each
quantile index. As such, CIQGMs can be used for validation of the graph
structure in the causal graphical models (\cite{pearl2009causality,
robins1986new, heckman2015causal}). One main advantage of these models is that
we can apply them to large collections of variables driven by non-Gaussian and
non-separable shocks. PQGMs characterize the statistical dependencies through
the graphs of the best linear predictors under asymmetric loss functions. PQGMs
make weaker assumptions than CIQGMs as they allow for misspecification. Because
of QGMs' ability to handle large collections of variables and focus on specific
parts of the distributions, we could apply them to quantify tail
interdependence. The resulting tail risk network can be used for measuring
systemic risk contributions that help make inroads in understanding
international financial contagion and dependence structures of returns under
downside market movements.
  We develop estimation and inference methods for QGMs focusing on the
high-dimensional case, where the number of variables in the graph is large
compared to the number of observations. For CIQGMs, these methods and results
include valid simultaneous choices of penalty functions, uniform rates of
convergence, and confidence regions that are simultaneously valid. We also
derive analogous results for PQGMs, which include new results for penalized
quantile regressions in high-dimensional settings to handle misspecification,
many controls, and a continuum of additional conditioning events.

unresolved: its composition, its production and growth mechanisms, and its
effect on background sources. Aims. We provide a more accurate relation between
dust depletion levels and dust-to-metals ratio (DTM), and to use the DTM to
investigate the origin and evolution of dust in the high-redshift Universe via
Gamma-ray burst damped Lyman-alpha absorbers (GRB-DLAs). Methods. We use
absorption-line measured metal column densities for a total of 19 GRB-DLAs,
including five new GRB afterglow spectra from VLT/X-shooter. We use the latest
linear models to calculate the dust depletion strength factor in each DLA.
Using these values we calculate total dust and metal column densities to
determine a DTM. We explore the evolution of DTM with metallicity, and compare
it to previous trends in DTM measured with different methods. Results. We find
significant dust depletion in 16 of our 19 GRB-DLAs, yet 18 of the 19 have a
DTM significantly lower than the Milky Way. We find that DTM is positively
correlated with metallicity, which supports a dominant ISM grain-growth mode of
dust formation. We find a substantial discrepancy between the dust content
measured from depletion and that derived from the total V-band extinction,
$A_V$ , measured by fitting the afterglow SED. We advise against using a
measurement from one method to estimate that from the other until the
discrepancy can be resolved.

However, great progress has been achieved in past years due to the good quality
and large statistics in experimental data collected by the current
observatories. The data of the Pierre Auger Observatory show that the
composition of the UHECRs becomes progressively lighter starting from $10^{17}$
eV up to $\sim 10^{18.3}$ eV and then, beyond that energy, it becomes
increasingly heavier. These analyses are subject to important systematic
uncertainties due to the use of hadronic interaction models that extrapolate
lower energy accelerator data to the highest energies. Although proton models
of UHECRs are disfavored by these results, they cannot be completely ruled out.
It is well known that the energy spectra of gamma rays and neutrinos, produced
during propagation of these very energetic particles through the intergalactic
medium, are a useful tool to constrain the spectrum models. In particular, it
has recently been shown that the neutrino upper limits obtained by IceCube
challenge the proton models at 95% CL. In this work we study the constraints
imposed by the extragalactic gamma-ray background, measured by Fermi-LAT, on
proton models of UHECRs. In particular, we make use of the extragalactic
gamma-ray background flux, integrated from 50 GeV to 2 TeV, that originates in
point sources, which has recently been obtained by the Fermi-LAT collaboration,
in combination with the neutrino upper limits, to constrain the emission of
UHECRs at high redshits ($z>1$), in the context of the proton models.

traditionally been implemented in terms of BLAS operations, incurring both a
performance and a storage overhead. Instead, we implement TC using the flexible
BLIS framework, which allows for transposition (reshaping) of the tensor to be
fused with internal partitioning and packing operations, requiring no explicit
transposition operations or additional workspace. This implementation, TBLIS,
achieves performance approaching that of MM, and in some cases considerably
higher than that of traditional TC. Our implementation supports multithreading
using an approach identical to that used for MM in BLIS, with similar
performance characteristics. The complexity of managing tensor-to-matrix
transformations is also handled automatically in our approach, greatly
simplifying its use in scientific applications.

decomposing the natural logarithm of the ratio of marginal likelihoods into
three components. These are, respectively, log ratios of likelihoods, prior

in each respective model under comparison should be contrasted in terms of the

leptonic CP violation in two ways. On the one hand, the CP-violating term in
the oscillation probability has a characteristic energy dependence that can be
better reproduced. On the other hand, the second oscillation maximum,
especially sensitive to $\delta_{CP}$, is better reconstructed. These effects
lead to a significant improvement in the fraction of values of $\delta_{CP}$
for which a $5 \sigma$ discovery of leptonic CP-violation would be possible.
The precision of the $\delta_{CP}$ measurement could also be greatly enhanced,
with a reduction of the maximum uncertainties from $26^\circ$ to $18^\circ$ for

photocathodes illuminated with ps-long UV laser pulses when the laser
transverse distribution consists of a flat-top core with Gaussian-like decaying
halo. The produced charge shows a linear dependence at low laser pulse energies
as expected in the quantum efficiency limited emission regime, while its
dependence on laser pulse energy is observed to be much weaker for higher
values, due to space charge limited emission. However, direct plug-in of
experimental parameters into the space charge tracking code ASTRA yields lower
output charge in the space charge limited regime compared to measured values.
The rate of increase of the produced charge at high laser pulse energies close
to the space charge limited emission regime seems to be proportional to the
amount of halo present in the radial laser profile since the charge from the
core has saturated already. By utilizing core + halo particle distributions
based on measured radial laser profiles, ASTRA simulations and semi-analytical
emission models reproduce the behavior of the measured charge for a wide range
of RF gun and laser operational parameters within the measurement
uncertainties.

electric charge is directly proportional to the density (or the chemical
potential), it becomes clear that for at least two freezeout conditions;
constant $s/T^3$ and $E/N$, the proposed analogy works very well. Dependence of
radiation (freezeout) temperature on finite electric-charge leads to an
excellent estimation for Kaon-to-pion ratio, for instance, especially in the

Hawing-Unruh radiation from charged black holes and the QCD hadronization at

the system is a bespoke water-cooled Hukin crucible supporting a casting mold.
Depending on the choice of mold, typical rods have a diameter between 6 mm and
10 mm and a length up to 90 mm, suitable for single-crystal growth by means of
float-zoning. The setup is all-metal sealed and may be baked out. We find that
the resulting ultra-high vacuum represents an important precondition for

thermodynamics and topology in the microcanonical ensemble. Indeed, we report
on results that point to the possibility of describing {\it interacting
classical spin systems} in the thermodynamic limit, including the occurrence of
a phase transition, using topology arguments only. Our approach relies on Morse
theory, through the determination of the critical points of the potential
energy, which is the proper Morse function. Our main finding is to show that,
in the context of the studied classical models, the Euler characteristic
$\chi(E)$ embeds the necessary features for a correct description of several
magnetic thermodynamic quantities of the systems, such as the magnetization,
correlation function, susceptibility, and critical temperature. Despite the
classical nature of the studied models, such quantities are those that do not
violate the laws of thermodynamics [with the proviso that Van der Waals loop
states are mean field (MF) artifacts]. We also discuss the subtle connection
between our approach using the Euler entropy, defined by the logarithm of the
modulus of $\chi(E)$ per site, and that using the {\it Boltzmann}
microcanonical entropy. Moreover, the results suggest that the loss of
regularity in the Morse function is associated with the occurrence of unstable
and metastable thermodynamic solutions in the MF case. The reliability of our
approach is tested in two exactly soluble systems: the infinite-range and the
short-range $XY$ models in the presence of a magnetic field. In particular, we
confirm that the topological hypothesis holds for both the infinite-range ($T_c
\neq 0$) and the short-range ($T_c = 0$) $XY$ models. Further studies are very
desirable in order to clarify the extension of the validity of our proposal.

to be a genuine weakly hyperbolic if all eigenvalues are real with no complete
set of linearly independent (LI) eigenvectors. To construct an upwind solver
based on flux difference splitting (FDS) framework, we require to generate
complete set of LI eigenvectors. This can be done through addition of
generalized eigenvectors which can be computed from theory of Jordan canonical
forms. Once we have complete set of LI generalized eigenvectors, we construct
upwind solvers in convection-pressure splitting framework. Since generalized
eigenvectors are not unique, we take extra care to ensure no direct
contribution of generalized eigenvectors in the final formulation of both the
newly developed numerical schemes. First scheme is based on Zha and Bilgen type
splitting approach, while second is based on Toro and V\'azquez splitting. Both
the schemes are tested on several bench-mark test problems on 1-D and one of

instabilities. The concept of generalized eigenvector based on Jordan forms is
found to be useful in dealing with the genuine weakly hyperbolic parts of the

Boltzmann-Gibbs and Tsallis statistics are very special cases of this generic
(non)extensivity. We conclude that the lattice thermodynamics is {\it ab

Tsallis statistics categorically are not matching with them, while the particle
production, for instance the particle ratios at various center-of-mass

The resulting freezeout parameters, the temperature and the chemical
