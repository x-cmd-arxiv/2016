directional biases, and growth rates of individuals. These traits may favor
certain genotypes and enhance their spatio-temporal spreading into areas
occupied by the less advantageous genotypes. We study how these factors
influence the speed of spreading in the case of two competing genotypes and
show that under the assumption of maintenance of spatially homogeneous total
population the dynamics of the frequency of one of the genotypes is
approximately described by the generalized
Fisher-Kolmogorov-Petrovskii-Piskunov (FKPP) equation. This generalized FKPP
equation with (nonlinear) frequency dependent diffusion and advection terms
admits traveling wave solutions (fronts/clines) that characterize the invasion
of the dominant genotype. Our existence results generalize the classical theory
for traveling waves for the FKPP with constant coefficients. Moreover for the
particular case of the quadratic (monostable) nonlinear growth-decay rate in
the generalized FKPP we study in details the influence of the variance in
diffusion and mean displacement rates of the two genotypes on the minimal wave
propagation speed.

  Villaamil","Width, depth and space",,,,,"cs.CC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The width measure treedepth, also known as vertex ranking, centered coloring
and elimination tree height, is a well-established notion which has recently
seen a resurgence of interest. Since graphs of bounded treedepth are more
restricted than graphs of bounded tree- or pathwidth, we are interested in the
algorithmic utility of this additional structure.
  On the negative side, we show that every dynamic programming algorithm on
treedepth decompositions of depth~$t$ cannot solve Dominating Set with
$O((3-\epsilon)^t \cdot \log n)$ space for any $\epsilon > 0$. This result
implies the same space lower bound for dynamic programming algorithms on tree
and path decompositions. We supplement this result by showing a space lower
bound of $O((3-\epsilon)^t \cdot \log n)$ for 3-Coloring and $O((2-\epsilon)^t
\cdot \log n)$ for Vertex Cover. This formalizes the common intuition that
dynamic programming algorithms on graph decompositions necessarily consume a
lot of space and complements known results of the time-complexity of problems
restricted to low-treewidth classes.
  We then show that treedepth lends itself to the design of branching
algorithms. This class of algorithms has in general distinct advantages over
dynamic programming algorithms: a) They use less space than algorithms based on
dynamic programming, b) they are easy to parallelize and c) they provide
possible solutions before terminating.
  Specifically, we design for Dominating Set a pure branching algorithm that
runs in time $t^{O(t^2)}\cdot n$ and uses space $O(t^3 \log t + t \log n)$ and
a hybrid of branching and dynamic programming that achieves a running time of
$O(3^t \log t \cdot n)$ while using $O(2^t t \log t + t \log n)$ space.
Algorithms for 3-Coloring and Vertex Cover with space complexity $O(t \cdot
\log n)$ and time complexity $O(3^t \cdot n)$ and $O(2^t\cdot n)$,
respectively, are included for completeness.

communications, but they also have the potential for providing very accurate
localization thanks to their high angular resolution. A difficult problem
arising indoors and outdoors is localizing users over multipath channels.
Localization based on angle of arrival (AOA) generally involves a two-step
procedure, where signals are first processed to obtain a user's AOA at
different base stations, followed by triangulation to determine the user's
position. In the presence of multipath, the performance of these methods is
greatly degraded due to the inability to correctly detect and/or estimate the
AOA of the line-of-sight (LOS) paths. To counter the limitations of this
two-step procedure which is inherently sub-optimal, we propose a direct
localization approach in which the position of a user is localized by jointly
processing the observations obtained at distributed massive MIMO base stations.
Our approach is based on a novel compressed sensing framework that exploits
channel properties to distinguish LOS from non-LOS signal paths, and leads to
improved performance results compared to previous existing methods.

the wind eventually breaks out of the disk, and most of the wind moves directly
out of the galaxy and is definitively lost. The fraction of the wind moving
nearly parallel to the galactic plane carves a hole in the disk which will
contract after the end of the SN activity. During the interval of time between
the end of the SN explosions and the ""closure"" of the hole, very O-poor stars
(the Extreme population) can form out of the super-AGB (asymptotic giant
branch) ejecta collected in the GC center. Once the hole contracts, the AGB
ejecta mix with the pristine gas, allowing the formation of stars with an
oxygen abundance intermediate between that of the very O-poor stars and that of
the pristine gas. We show that this mechanism may explain why Extreme
populations are present only in massive clusters, and can also produce a
correlation between the spread in helium and the cluster mass. Finally, we also
explore the possibility that our proposed mechanism can be extended to the case
of multiple populations showing bimodality in the iron content, with the
presence of two populations characterized by a small difference in [Fe/H]. Such
a result can be obtained taking into account the contribution of delayed SN II.

thermodynamic potential has a logarithmic contribution, which turns out to be

simulations are fit to observed data by changing the wave velocity model of the
medium under investigation. The problem is non-linear, and therefore
optimization techniques have been used to find a reasonable solution to the
problem. The main problem in fitting the data is the lack of low spatial
frequencies. This deficiency often leads to a local minimum and to
non-plausible solutions. In this work we explore how to obtain low frequency
information for FWI. Our approach involves augmenting FWI with travel time
tomography, which has low-frequency features. By jointly inverting these two
problems we enrich FWI with information that can replace low frequency data. In
addition, we use high order regularization, in a preliminary inversion stage,
to prevent high frequency features from polluting our model in the initial
stages of the reconstruction. This regularization also promotes the
non-dominant low-frequency modes that exist in the FWI sensitivity. By applying
a joint FWI and travel time inversion we are able to obtain a smooth model than
can later be used to recover a good approximation for the true model. A second
contribution of this paper involves the acceleration of the main computational
bottleneck in FWI--the solution of the Helmholtz equation. We show that the
solution time can be reduced by solving the equation for multiple right hand
sides using block multigrid preconditioned Krylov methods.

ranging from computer vision to geoscience. This equation can be efficiently
solved using the iterative Fast Sweeping (FS) methods and the direct Fast
Marching (FM) methods. However, when used for a point source, the original
eikonal equation is known to yield inaccurate numerical solutions, because of a
singularity at the source. In this case, the factored eikonal equation is often
preferred, and is known to yield a more accurate numerical solution. One
application that requires the solution of the eikonal equation for point
sources is travel time tomography. This inverse problem may be formulated using
the eikonal equation as a forward problem. While this problem has been solved
using FS in the past, the more recent choice for applying it involves FM
methods because of the efficiency in which sensitivities can be obtained using
them. However, while several FS methods are available for solving the factored
equation, the FM method is available only for the original eikonal equation.
  In this paper we develop a Fast Marching algorithm for the factored eikonal
equation, using both first and second order finite-difference schemes. Our
algorithm follows the same lines as the original FM algorithm and requires the
same computational effort. In addition, we show how to obtain sensitivities
using this FM method and apply travel time tomography, formulated as an inverse

that our algorithm solves the factored eikonal equation efficiently, and
demonstrate the achieved accuracy for computing the travel time. We also

naturally associated orthogonal systems that in fact involve the classical

graphene. Another promising application of graphene is related to its use as a
spacer separating ferromagnetic metals (FMs) in vertical magnetoresistive
devices, the most prominent class of spintronic devices widely used as magnetic
sensors. In particular, few-layer graphene was predicted to act as a perfect
spin filter. Here we show that the role of graphene in such devices (at least
in the absence of epitaxial alignment between graphene and the FMs) is
different and determined by proximity-induced spin splitting and charge
transfer with adjacent ferromagnetic metals, making graphene a weak FM
electrode rather than a spin filter. To this end, we report observations of
magnetoresistance (MR) in vertical Co-graphene-NiFe junctions with 1 to 4
graphene layers separating the ferromagnets, and demonstrate that the
dependence of the MR sign on the number of layers and its inversion at
relatively small bias voltages is consistent with spin transport between weakly
doped and differently spin-polarized layers of graphene. The proposed
interpretation is supported by the observation of an MR sign reversal in biased
Co-graphene-hBN-NiFe devices and by comprehensive structural characterization.

[cu]_{s=1} [ud]_{s=0}; L_{\mathcal{P}}=1, J^{\rm P}=\frac{5}{2}^+ \}$, where
$s=0,1$ are the spins of the diquarks and $L_{\mathcal{P}}=0,1$ are the orbital
angular momentum quantum numbers of the pentaquarks. We point out that heavy
quark symmetry allows only the higher mass pentaquark state $P_c^+(4450)$
having $[ud]_{s=0}$ to be produced in $\Lambda_b^0$ decays, whereas the lower
mass state $P_c^+(4380)$ having $[ud]_{s=1}$ is disfavored. Pentaquark spectrum
is rich enough to accommodate a $J^P=\frac{3}{2}^-$ state, which has the
correct light diquark spin $\{\bar{c} [cu]_{s=1} [ud]_{s=0}; L_{\mathcal{P}}=0,
J^{\rm P}=\frac{3}{2}^- \}$ to be produced in $\Lambda_b^0$ decays. Assuming
that the orbital mass difference between the charmed pentaquarks is similar to
the corresponding mass difference in the charmed baryons, we estimate the mass
of the lower pentaquark $J^P=3/2^-$ state to be about 4110 MeV and suggest to
reanalyze the LHCb data to search for this third state. We present the
spectroscopy of the $S$- and $P$-wave pentaquark states having a $c\bar{c}$
pair and three light quarks using an effective Hamiltonian approach. Some of
these pentaquarks can be produced in weak decays of the $b$-baryons. Combining
heavy quark symmetry and the $SU(3)_F$ symmetry results in strikingly simple
relations among the decay amplitudes which are presented here.

which a pair of linear nanoscale slots are used to create two coupled high-$Q$
optical resonances. The optical cavity supermodes, whose frequencies are
designed to lie in the $1500$~nm wavelength band, are shown to interact
strongly with mechanical resonances of the structure whose frequencies range
from a few MHz to a few GHz. Depending upon the symmetry of the mechanical
modes and the symmetry of the slot sizes, we show that the optomechanical
coupling between the optical supermodes can be either linear or quadratic in
the mechanical displacement amplitude. Tuning of the nanoscale slot size is
also shown to adjust the magnitude and sign of the cavity supermode splitting
$2J$, enabling near-resonant motional scattering between the two optical
supermodes and greatly enhancing the $x^2$-coupling strength. Specifically, for
the fundamental flexural mode of the central nanobeam of the structure at
$10$~MHz the per-phonon linear cross-mode coupling rate is calculated to be
$\tilde{g}_{+-}/2\pi = 1$~MHz, corresponding to a per-phonon $x^2$-coupling
rate of $\tilde{g}'/2\pi=1$~kHz for a mode splitting $2J/2\pi = 1$~GHz which is

in the TLL has been recently under intense scrutiny in a perturbative
\emph{g-ology} framework, an aspect that has been overlooked so far is the role
of the Galilean invariance breaking. We find that, although the differential

Galilean invariance breaking term constant for every $J_z$. We point out the
features of dynamics during the quench that stays unaltered, and those that

competitions. Notably, we focus on the invasive dynamics of external agents,
like bacteria, within a host organism. The former are mapped to a population of
defectors that aim to spread in the extracellular medium of the host. In turn,
the latter is composed of cells, mapped to a population of cooperators, that
aim to kill pathogens. The cooperative behavior of cells is fundamental for the
emergence of the living functions of the whole organism, since each one
contributes to a specific set of tasks. So, broadly speaking, their
contribution can be viewed as a form of energy. When bacteria are spatially
close to a cell, the latter can use a fraction of its energy to remove them. On
the other hand, when bacteria survive an attack, they absorb the received
energy, becoming stronger and more resistant to further attacks. In addition,
since bacteria play as defectors, their unique target is to increase their
wealth, without supporting their own kind. As in many living organisms, the
host temperature plays a relevant role in the host-pathogen equilibrium. For
instance, in animals like human beings, a neural mechanism triggers the
increasing of the body temperature in order to activate the immune system.
Here, cooperators succeed once bacteria are completely removed while, in the
opposite scenario, the host undergoes a deep invasive process, like a blood
poisoning. Results of numerical simulations show that the dynamics of the
proposed model allow to reach a variety of states. At a very high level of
abstraction, some of these states seem to be similar to those that can be
observed in some living systems. Therefore, to conclude, we deem that our model
might be exploited for studying further biological phenomena.

with a curved $A_{\infty}$ morphism to the ring of differential operators on
$\mathcal{L}$; for line bundles on smooth Lagrangian subvarieties of smooth

high positive anomalies during the winter (Dec-Feb) in Sea Surface Temperatures

for the season to those predicted by model simulations 8 to 12 months ahead,
starting in January each year. Encouraged by accurate forecasts for the low
risk of cholera for this period, we then generated a prediction for this coming
season. An increase above the third quantile in cholera cases is expected for
the period of Aug - Dec 2016 with 92% and 87% probability respectively for the
two models. This alert warrants the preparedness of the public health system.
We discuss the possible limitations of our approach, including variations in
the impact of El Ni\~no events, and the importance of this large, warm event

matter scatters off electrons in a scintillating target. The excitation and
subsequent de-excitation of the electron produces one or more photons, which
could be detected with an array of cryogenic low-noise photodetectors, such as
transition edge sensors (TES) or microwave kinetic inductance devices (MKID).
Scintillators may have distinct advantages over other experiments searching for
a low ionization signal from sub-GeV DM. First, the detection of one or a few
photons may be technologically easier. Second, since no electric field is
required to detect the photons, there may be far fewer dark counts mimicking a
DM signal. We discuss various target choices, but focus on calculating the
expected dark matter-electron scattering rates in three scintillating crystals,
sodium iodide (NaI), cesium iodide (CsI), and gallium arsenide (GaAs). Among
these, GaAs has the lowest band gap (1.52 eV) compared to NaI (5.9 eV) or CsI
(6.4 eV), allowing it to probe dark matter masses possibly as low as ~0.5 MeV,
compared to ~1.5 MeV with NaI or CsI. We compare these scattering rates with
those expected in silicon (Si) and germanium (Ge). The proposed experimental
concept presents an important complementary path to existing efforts, and its
potential advantages may make it the most sensitive direct-detection probe of

dissipation-driven, formation scenarios in which strong nuclear starbursts
transform larger, star-forming progenitors into compact quiescent galaxies.

current generation of instruments can exhibit sensitivity variations greater
than the astrophysical signals. For the InfraRed Array Camera (IRAC) on the
Spitzer Space Telescope, a popular way to handle this is
BiLinearly-Interpolated Subpixel Sensitivity (BLISS) mapping. As part of a
Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC), BLISS mapping estimates the sensitivity at
many locations (knots) on the pixel, then interpolates to the target star's
centroids. We show that such embedded optimization schemes can misfit or bias
parameters. Thus, we construct a model of $\textit{Spitzer}$ eclipse light
curves to test the accuracy and precision of BLISS mapping. We compare standard
BLISS mapping to a variant where the knots are fit during the MCMC, as well as
to a polynomial model. Both types of BLISS mapping give similar eclipse depths,
and we find that standard knots behave like real parameters. Standard BLISS
mapping is therefore a reasonable shortcut to fitting for knots in an MCMC.
BLISS maps become inaccurate when the photon noise is low, but typically
approximate the real sensitivity well. We also find there is no perfect method
for choosing the ideal number of BLISS knots to use on given data. BLISS
mapping gives fits that are usually more accurate than precise (i.e. they are
overly conservative), and the routine is more precise than polynomial models
for significant eclipses or pixels with more varied sensitivities. BLISS
mapping has better predictive power for most of these particular synthetic
data, depending on how one treats time-correlated residuals. Overall, we
conclude that BLISS mapping can be a reasonable sensitivity model for IRAC
photometry.

combination and how it can be extended to include other tracers in the context

To
explain these observations Bastian et al. suggested a scenario in which a
second population is formed by the accretion of enriched material onto the
low-mass stars in the initial GC population. The idea is that the low-mass,
pre-main sequence stars sweep up gas expelled by the massive stars of the same
generation into their protoplanetary disc as they move through the GC core. We
perform simulations with 2 different smoothed particle hydrodynamics codes to
investigate if a low-mass star surrounded by a protoplanetary disc can accrete
the amount of enriched material required in this scenario. We focus on the gas
loading rate onto the disc and star as well as on the lifetime of the disc. We
find that the gas loading rate is a factor of 2 smaller than the geometric
rate, because the effective cross section of the disc is smaller than its
surface area. The loading rate is consistent for both codes, irrespective of
resolution. The disc gains mass in the high resolution runs, but loses angular
momentum on a time scale of 10^4 yrs. Two effects determine the loss of
(specific) angular momentum in our simulations: 1) continuous ram pressure
stripping and 2) accretion of material with no azimuthal angular momentum. Our
study and previous work suggest that the former, dominant process is mainly
caused by numerical rather than physical effects, while the latter is not. The
latter process causes the disc to become more compact, increasing the surface
density profile at smaller radii. The disc size is determined in the first
place by the ram pressure when the flow first hits the disc. Further evolution
is governed by the decrease in the specific angular momentum of the disc. We
conclude that the size and lifetime of the disc are probably not sufficient to
accrete the amount of mass required in Bastian et al.'s scenario.

associated with enhanced gas content and star-formation in the disks of
low-redshift galaxies, so are important in the understanding of star-formation
in the local universe. As both the visual appearance of spiral structure, and
the mechanisms responsible for it vary from galaxy to galaxy, a reliable method
for defining spiral samples with different visual morphologies is required. In
this paper, we develop a new debiasing method to reliably correct for
redshift-dependent bias in Galaxy Zoo 2, and release the new set of debiased
classifications. Using these, a luminosity-limited sample of ~18,000 Sloan

similar ranges of stellar mass and environment, many-armed galaxies display

Sloan Digital Sky Survey Data Release 12 (SDSS DR12) database, allows us to
estimate the stellar velocity dispersion of member galaxies of Abell 2142. This
quantity is used as proxy for the total mass of secure cluster members and is
properly compared with that of subhalos in simulations. We find that simulated
halos have a statistically significant ($\gtrsim 7$ sigma confidence level)
smaller amount of massive (circular velocity above $200\,{\rm km\, s^{-1}}$)
subhalos, even before accounting for the possible incompleteness of
observations. These results corroborate the findings from a recent strong
lensing study of the Hubble Frontier Fields galaxy cluster MACS J0416
\citep{grillo2015} and suggest that the observed difference is already present
at the level of dark matter (DM) subhalos and is not solved by introducing
baryonic physics. A deeper understanding of this discrepancy between
observations and simulations will provide valuable insights into the impact of
the physical properties of DM particles and the effect of baryons on the
formation and evolution of cosmological structures.

mapping between the distributions of galaxies and the full matter density
fields, comparing different measurements and predictions. Associating galaxies
with dark matter haloes in the MICE Grand Challenge N-body simulation we
directly measure the bias parameters by comparing the smoothed density
fluctuations of haloes and matter in the same region at different positions as
a function of smoothing scale. Alternatively we measure the bias parameters by
matching the probability distributions of halo and matter density fluctuations,
which can be applied to observations. These direct bias measurements are
compared to corresponding measurements from two-point and different third-order
correlations, as well as predictions from the peak-background model, which we
presented in previous articles using the same data. We find an overall
variation of the linear bias measurements and predictions of $\sim 5 \%$ with
respect to results from two-point correlations for different halo samples with
masses between $\sim 10^{12} - 10^{15}$ $h^{-1}M_\odot$ at the redshifts
$z=0.0$ and $0.5$. Variations between the second- and third-order bias
parameters from the different methods show larger variations, but with
consistent trends in mass and redshift. The various bias measurements reveal a
tight relation between the linear and the quadratic bias parameters, which is
consistent with results from the literature based on simulations with different
cosmologies. Such a universal relation might improve constraints on
cosmological models, derived from second-order clustering statistics at small
scales or higher-order clustering statistics.

precludes the standard definition of the former's essential principle of
locality, in terms of commuting local observables. We examine this conflict
more carefully, by investigating implications of gauge (diffeomorphism)
invariance for observables in gravity. We prove a dressing theorem, showing
that any operator with nonzero Poincare charges, and in particular any
compactly-supported operator, in flat-spacetime quantum field theory must be
gravitationally dressed once coupled to gravity, i.e. it must depend on the
metric at arbitrarily long distances, and we put lower bounds on this nonlocal
dependence. This departure from standard locality occurs in the most severe way
possible: in perturbation theory about flat spacetime, at leading order in
Newton's constant. The physical observables in a gravitational theory therefore
do not organize themselves into local commuting subalgebras: the principle of
locality must apparently be reformulated or abandoned, and in fact we lack a
clear definition of the coarser and more basic notion of a quantum subsystem of
the Universe. We discuss relational approaches to locality based on
diffeomorphism-invariant nonlocal operators, and reinforce arguments that any
such locality is state-dependent and approximate. We also find limitations to
the utility of bilocal diffeomorphism-invariant operators that are considered
in cosmological contexts. An appendix provides a concise review of the
canonical covariant formalism for gravity, instrumental in the discussion of
Poincare charges and their associated long-range fields.

of densities in spheres at large separation are presented. These bias functions
generalize the so-called Kaiser bias to the mildly non-linear regime for
arbitrary density contrasts. The derivation is carried out in the context of
large deviation statistics while relying on the spherical collapse model. A
logarithmic transformation provides a saddle approximation which is valid for
the whole range of densities and shown to be accurate against the 30 Gpc cube
state-of-the-art Horizon Run 4 simulation. Special configurations of two
concentric spheres that allow to identify peaks are employed to obtain the
conditional bias and a proxy to BBKS extrema correlation functions. These
analytic bias functions should be used jointly with extended perturbation
theory to predict two-point clustering statistics as they capture the
non-linear regime of structure formation at the percent level down to scales of
about 10 Mpc/h at redshift 0. Conversely, the joint statistics also provide us
with optimal dark matter two-point correlation estimates which can be applied
either universally to all spheres or to a restricted set of biased (over- or
underdense) pairs. Based on a simple fiducial survey, this estimator is shown
to perform five times better than usual two-point function estimators.

  Condition",,,,,"math.OC cs.LG cs.NA stat.ML","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In this paper, a new theory is developed for first-order stochastic convex
optimization, showing that the global convergence rate is sufficiently
quantified by a local growth rate of the objective function in a neighborhood
of the optimal solutions. In particular, if the objective function $F(\mathbf
w)$ in the $\epsilon$-sublevel set grows as fast as $\|\mathbf w - \mathbf
w_*\|_2^{1/\theta}$, where $\mathbf w_*$ represents the closest optimal
solution to $\mathbf w$ and $\theta\in(0,1]$ quantifies the local growth rate,
the iteration complexity of first-order stochastic optimization for achieving
an $\epsilon$-optimal solution can be $\widetilde O(1/\epsilon^{2(1-\theta)})$,
which is optimal at most up to a logarithmic factor. To achieve the faster
global convergence, we develop two different accelerated stochastic subgradient
methods by iteratively solving the original problem approximately in a local
region around a historical solution with the size of the local region gradually
decreasing as the solution approaches the optimal set. Besides the theoretical
improvements, this work also includes new contributions towards making the
proposed algorithms practical: (i) we present practical variants of accelerated
stochastic subgradient methods that can run without the knowledge of
multiplicative growth constant and even the growth rate $\theta$; (ii) we
consider a broad family of problems in machine learning to demonstrate that the
proposed algorithms enjoy faster convergence than traditional stochastic
subgradient method. We also characterize the complexity of the proposed
algorithms for ensuring the gradient is small without the smoothness
assumption.

100 km/s, there is clear bias between HI based velocities and Vmax, that leads
to an underestimation of the actual circular velocity of the halo. When this
bias is taken into account the CDM model has no trouble in reproducing the
observed velocity function and no lack of low velocity galaxies is actually
present. Our simulations also reproduce the linewidth - stellar mass
(Tully-Fisher) relation and HI sizes, indicating that the HI gas in our
simulations is as extended as observed. The physical reason for the lower than
expected linewidths is that, in contrast to high mass galaxies, low mass
galaxies no longer have extended thin HI rotating disks, as is commonly
assumed.

diverse data have yet to be synthesized with the growing understanding of
self-generated thought gained from neuroimaging, however. Here, we highlight
several areas of ongoing inquiry and illustrate how evidence from other

neuroimaging. Each methodology has particular strengths: functional
neuroimaging reveals much about the variety of brain areas and networks
reliably recruited. Lesion studies point to regions critical to generating and
consciously experiencing self-generated thought. Human intracranial
electrophysiology illuminates how and where in the brain thought is generated
and where this activity subsequently spreads. Finally, measurement and
manipulation of neurotransmitter and hormone levels can clarify what kind of
neurochemical milieu drives or facilitates self-generated cognition.
Integrating evidence from multiple complementary modalities will be a critical

strictly related to fundamental aspects of UV-physics scenarios, such as string
theory or supergravity. After a short introduction to standard and inflationary
cosmology, we present our research findings. On the one hand, we show that
focusing on universality properties of inflation can yield surprisingly
stringent bounds on its dynamics. This approach allows us to identify the
regime where the inflationary field range is uniquely determined by both the
tensor-to-scalar ratio and the spectral index. Then, we derive a novel
field-range bound, which is two orders of magnitude stronger than the original
one derived by Lyth. On the other hand, we discuss the embedding of inflation
in supergravity and prove that non-trivial hyperbolic K\""ahler geometries
induce an attractor for the inflationary observables: the spectral tilt tends
automatically to the center of the Planck dome whereas the amount of primordial
gravitational waves is directly controlled by curvature of the internal
manifold. We identify the origin of this attractor mechanism in the so-called
$\alpha$-scale supergravity model. Finally, we show how the inclusion of a
nilpotent sector, allowing for a unified description of inflation and dark
energy, implies an enhancement of the attractor nature of the theory. The main
results of this thesis have been already published elsewhere. However, here we

of the progenitors can be found by investigating environments in which such
transients occur. While studies of LGRB host galaxies have a long history,
dedicated observational campaigns have only recently resulted in a high enough
number of photometrically and spectroscopically observed SLSN hosts to allow
statistically significant analysis of their properties. In this paper we make a
comparison of the host galaxies of hydrogen-poor (H-poor) SLSNe and the
Swift/BAT6 sample of LGRBs. In contrast to previous studies we use a complete
sample of LGRBs and we address a special attention to the comparison
methodology and the selection of SLSN sample whose data have been compiled from
the available literature. At intermediate redshifts (0.3 < z < 0.7) the two
classes of transients select galaxies whose properties (stellar mass,
luminosity, star-formation rate, specific star-formation rate and metallicity)
do not differ on average significantly. Moreover, the host galaxies of both
classes of objects follow the fundamental metallicity relation and the
fundamental plane of metallicity. In contrast to previous studies we show that
at intermediate redshifts the emission line equivalent widths of the two
populations are essentially the same and that the previous claims regarding the
higher fraction of SLSN hosts among the extreme emission line galaxies with
respect to LGRBs are mostly due to a larger fraction of strong-line emitters
among SLSN hosts at z < 0.3, where samples of LGRB hosts are small and poorly
defined.

interesting approach is traversal-based query execution which fetches data by
traversing data links and, thus, is able to make use of up-to-date data from
initially unknown data sources. The downside of this approach is the delay
before the query engine completes a query execution. In this paper, we address
this problem by proposing an approach to return as many elements of the result

that aims to fetch result-relevant data as early as possible. The challenge for
such a strategy is that the query engine does not know a priori which of the
data sources that will be discovered during the query execution contain
result-relevant data. We introduce 16 different traversal approaches and
experimentally study their impact on response times. Our experiments show that
some of the approaches can achieve significant improvements over the baseline
of looking up URIs on a first-come, first-served basis. Additionally, we verify
the importance of these approaches by showing that typical query optimization
techniques that focus solely on the process of constructing the query result
cannot have any significant impact on the response times of traversal-based

Our most robust estimate of $\kappa_\mathrm{ext}$ has a median value
$\kappa^\mathrm{med}_\mathrm{ext} = 0.004$ and a standard deviation of
$\sigma_\kappa = 0.025$. The measured $\sigma_\kappa$ corresponds to $2.5\%$
uncertainty on the time delay distance, and hence the Hubble constant $H_0$
inference from this system. The median $\kappa^\mathrm{med}_\mathrm{ext}$ value
is robust to $\sim0.005$ (i.e. $\sim0.5\%$ on $H_0$) regardless of the adopted
aperture radius, limiting magnitude and weighting scheme, as long as the latter
incorporates galaxy number counts, the projected distance to the main lens, and
a prior on the external shear obtained from mass modeling. The availability of
a well-constrained $\kappa_\mathrm{ext}$ makes \hequad\ a valuable system for
measuring cosmological parameters using strong gravitational lens time delays.

model-based hybrid recommendation systems typically require extensive feature
engineering to construct a user profile. Statistical Relational Learning (SRL)
provides a straightforward way to combine the two approaches. However, due to
the large scale of the data used in real world recommendation systems, little
research exists on applying SRL models to hybrid recommendation systems, and
essentially none of that research has been applied on real big-data-scale
systems. In this paper, we proposed a way to adapt the state-of-the-art in SRL
learning approaches to construct a real hybrid recommendation system.
Furthermore, in order to satisfy a common requirement in recommendation systems

in stellar evolution. While Smith and Tombleson proposed that their isolated
environments indicate that LBVs must be largely the product of binary
evolution, Humphreys et al. have recently expressed the view that the
traditional single-star view still holds if one appropriately selects a
subsample of LBVs. This paper finds the claim of Humphreys et al. to be
quantitatively unjustified. A statistical test of ""candidate"" as opposed to
""confirmed"" LBVs shows no significant difference ($<$1$\sigma$) between their
environments. Even if the sample is further subdivided as proposed, the three
most luminous LBVs are spatially dispersed similar to late O-type dwarfs, which
have much longer lifetimes than expected for classical LBVs. Lower-luminosity
LBVs have a distribution associated with red supergiants (RSGs), but these RSGs
are dominated by stars of 10-15 M$_{\odot}$ initial mass, with much longer
lifetimes than expected for those lower-luminosity LBVs. If one's view is
restricted to the highest-luminosity LBVs, then the appropriate comparison is
with early O-type stars that are their presumed progenitors, when this is done,
it is clear that even the high-luminosity LBVs are more dispersed than
expected. Humphreys et al. also suggest that velocities of LBVs support the
single-star view, being inconsistent with runaways. A quantitative analysis of
the radial velocity distribution of LBVS in M31 and M33 contradicts this,
modest runway speeds expected from mass gainers in binary evolution are
consistent with the observed velocities, although the data lack the precision
to discriminate.

partly fills the ring's interior. To constrain the influence of the stellar
wind on this structure, we obtained an ultraviolet (UV) spectrum of the central
star of SBW1 with the HST Cosmic Origins Spectrograph (COS). The UV spectrum
shows none of the typical wind signatures, indicating a very low mass-loss
rate. Radiative transfer models suggest an extremely low rate below 10$^{-10}$
Msun/yr, although we find that cooling timescales probably become comparable to
or longer than the flow time below 10$^{-8}$ Msun/yr. We therefore adopt this
latter value as a conservative upper limit. For the central star, the model
yields $T_{\rm eff}$=21,000$\pm$1000 K, $L\simeq$5$\times$10$^4$ $L_{\odot}$,
and roughly Solar composition except for enhanced N abundance. SBW1's very low
mass-loss rate may hinder the wind's ability to shape the surrounding nebula.
The very low mass-loss rate also impairs the wind's ability to shed angular
momentum; the spin-down timescale for magnetic breaking is more than 500 times
longer than the age of the ring. This, combined with the star's slow rotation
rate, constrain merger scenarios to form ring nebulae. The mass-loss rate is at
least 10 times lower than expected from mass-loss recipes, without any account
of clumping. The physical explanation for why SBW1's wind is so weak presents
an interesting mystery.

The current source continues to be dominated by ongoing late-time CSM
interaction that produces strong H-alpha emission and a weak pseudo-continuum,
as found previously for 1-2 yr after explosion. The intent of these
observations was to search for evidence of recent star formation in the local
(1kpc; 10 arcsec) environment around SN 2009ip, in the remote outskirts of its
host spiral galaxy NGC 7259. We can rule out the presence of any massive
star-forming complexes like 30 Dor or the Carina Nebula at the SN site or
within a few kpc. If the progenitor of SN 2009ip was really a 50-80 Msun star
as archival HST images suggested, then it is strange that there is no sign of
this type of massive star formation anywhere in the vicinity. A possible
explanation is that the progenitor was the product of a merger or binary mass
transfer, rejuvenated after a lifetime that was much longer than 4-5 Myr,
allowing its natal H II region to have faded. A smaller region like the Orion
Nebula would be an unresolved but easily detected point source. This is ruled
out within 1.5 kpc around SN 2009ip, but a small H II region could be hiding in
the glare of SN 2009ip itself. Later images after a few more years have passed
are needed to confirm that the progenitor candidate is truly gone and to test
for the presence of a small H II region or cluster at the SN position.

  In chapter 1, we propose a new quantum computational model, called the `power
of one qumode', that relies mainly on a single-mode photonic squeezed state. In
particular, we show the amount of squeezing can quantitatively relate the
resource requirements of factoring to the problem of finding the trace of large
unitary matrices, a result with consequences for understanding how powerful
quantum computation really is. Furthermore, we can connect squeezing to other
known resources like precision, energy, qudit dimensionality and qubit number,
which is a useful stepping stone to finding the resources that enable quantum
computation.
  In chapter 2, we exploit the quantum mechanical properties of photonic states
for use in precision parameter estimation of general linear optical processes,
which is useful for a diverse number of applications, from characterising an
unknown process in a photonic quantum computer to biological imaging. We
introduce a formalism that quantifies this improvement in precision. We also
provide conditions under which one can easily check for photonic states that
are optimal to use in this context, which is a potentially important result for
future experimental efforts.
  In chapter 3, we explore the connection between two-mode squeezed states,
commonly used in quantum optics, and relativistic quantum processes, in
particular in cosmology. Using this connection, we apply recently developed
tools from the thermodynamics of quantum systems perturbed far from equilibrium
to address an old question of entropy production in cosmology from a surprising
new angle.

and black hole spin. This correlation, if confirmed, points towards the idea
that relativistic jets may be powered by the rotational energy of black holes.
In order to examine this further, we perform general-relativistic radiative
transport calculations on magnetically arrested accretion flows, which are
known to produce powerful jets via the Blandford-Znajek (BZ) mechanism. We find
that the X-ray and gamma-ray emission strongly depend on spin and inclination
angle. Surprisingly, the high-energy power does not show the same dependence on
spin as the BZ jet power, but instead can be understood as a redshift effect.
In particular, photons observed perpendicular to the spin axis suffer little
net redshift until originating from close to the horizon. Such observers see
deeper into the hot, dense, highly-magnetized inner disk region. This effect is
largest for rapidly rotating black holes due to a combination of frame dragging
and decreasing horizon radius. While the X-ray emission is dominated by the
near horizon region, the near-infrared radiation originates at larger radii.
Therefore, the ratio of X-ray to near-infrared power is an observational
signature of black hole spin.

determined for the first time from a combination of magnetization,
muon-spin-rotation and electrical resistivity measurements. The ferromagnetic
phase is suppressed near $2.1$~GPa, but quantum criticality is avoided by the
appearance of a magnetic phase, likely modulated, AFM$_Q$. Our density
functional theory total energy calculations suggest a near degeneracy of
antiferromagnetic states with small magnetic wave vectors $Q$ allowing for the
potential of an ordering wave vector evolving from $Q=0$ to finite $Q$, as
expected from the most recent theories on ferromagnetic quantum criticality.
Our findings show that LaCrGe$_3$ is a very simple example to study this
scenario of avoided ferromagnetic quantum criticality and will inspire further
study on this material and other itinerant ferromagnets.

high resolution X-ray spectroscopy of Ark 120 is presented, from XMM-Newton
observations which were carried out in March 2014, together with simultaneous
Chandra/HETG exposures. The high resolution spectra confirmed the lack of
intrinsic absorbing gas associated with Ark 120, with the only X-ray absorption
present originating from the ISM of our own Galaxy, with a possible slight
enhancement of the Oxygen abundance required with respect to the expected ISM
values in the Solar neighbourhood. However, the presence of several soft X-ray
emission lines are revealed for the first time in the XMM-Newton RGS spectrum,
associated to the AGN and arising from the He and H-like ions of N, O, Ne and
Mg. The He-like line profiles of N, O and Ne appear velocity broadened, with
typical FWHM widths of $\sim5000$ km s$^{-1}$, whereas the H-like profiles are
unresolved. From the clean measurement of the He-like triplets, we deduce that
the broad lines arise from gas of density $n_{\rm e}\sim10^{11}$ cm$^{-3}$,
while the photoionization calculations infer that the emitting gas covers at
least 10 percent of $4\pi$ steradian. Thus the broad soft X-ray profiles appear
coincident with an X-ray component of the optical-UV Broad Line Region on
sub-pc scales, whereas the narrow profiles originate on larger pc scales,
perhaps coincident with the AGN Narrow Line Region. The observations show that
Ark 120 is not intrinsically bare and substantial X-ray emitting gas exists out
of our direct line of sight towards this AGN.

Here, we present our results on the extensive ~ 600 ks of XMM-Newton archival
observations of the bright and highly variable Seyfert 1 galaxy NGC 4051, whose
spectrum has revealed a complex multicomponent wind. Making use of both RGS and
EPIC-pn data, we performed a detailed analysis through a time-dependent
photoionization code in combination with spectral and Fourier spectral-timing
techniques. The source light curves and the warm absorber parameters obtained
from the data were used to simulate the response of the gas due to variations
in the ionizing flux of the central source. The resulting time variable spectra
were employed to predict the effects of the warm absorber on the time lags and
coherence of the energy dependent light curves. We have found that, in the
absence of any other lag mechanisms, a warm absorber with the characteristics
of the one observed in NGC 4051, is able to produce soft lags, up to 100 s, on
timescales of ~ hours. The time delay is associated with the response of the
gas to changes in the ionizing source, either by photoionization or radiative
recombination, which is dependent on its density. The range of radial distances
that, under our assumptions, yield longer time delays are comparable to the
existing estimates of the location of the warm absorber in NGC 4051. For this
reason, we suggest that it is likely that the observed X-ray time lags may
carry a signature of the warm absorber response time, to changes in the
ionizing continuum. These results highlight the importance of understanding the
contribution of the warm absorber to the AGN X-ray time lags, since it is also
vital information for interpreting the lags associated with propagation and
reverberation effects in the inner emitting regions.

to changing the mass in a free Majorana fermion field theory, we study the
effect of an integrability breaking perturbation by the longitudinal magnetic

persistent oscillations with frequencies set by the low-lying particle
excitations not only for small, but even for moderate size quenches. In the
ferromagnetic phase these particles are the various non-perturbative confined
bound states of the domain wall excitations, while in the paramagnetic phase
the single magnon excitation governs the dynamics, allowing us to capture the

the sum of neutrino mass in the small $m_\nu < 1eV$ limit in which the early
broadband shape determined before the last scattering surface is immune from
the variation of $m_\nu$. The signature of $m_\nu$ is imprinted on the altered
shape of the power spectrum at later epoch, which provides an opportunity to
access the non--trivial $m_\nu$ through the measured anisotropic correlation
function in redshift space (hereafter RSD instead of Redshift Space
Distortion). The non--linear RSD corrections with massive neutrinos in the
quasi linear regime are approximately estimated using one-loop order terms
computed by tomographic linear solutions. We suggest a new approach to probe
$m_\nu$ simultaneously with all other distance measures and coherent growth
functions, exploiting this deformation of the early broadband shape of the
spectrum at later epoch. If the origin of cosmic acceleration is unknown,
$m_\nu$ is poorly determined after marginalising over all other observables.
However, we find that the measured distances and coherent growth functions are
minimally affected by the presence of mild neutrino mass. Although the standard
model of cosmic acceleration is assumed to be the cosmological constant, the
constraint on $m_\nu$ is little improved. Interestingly, the measured CMB
distance to the last scattering surface sharply slices the degeneracy between
the matter content and $m_\nu$, and the hidden $m_\nu$ is excavated to be
$m_\nu=0.19^{+0.28}_{-0.17} eV$ which is different from massless neutrino more

advantage of the Bragg peak and the relative biological effectiveness (RBE) for
uniform dose conformation to a tumor. The treatment plans are usually evaluated
with total RBE-weighted dose, which is however deficient in relevance to the
biological effect in the linear-quadratic model due to its quadratic-dose term,
or the dose-fractionation effect. In this study, we reformulate the
extrapolated response dose (ERD), or synonymously BED, which normalizes the
dose-fractionation and cell-repopulation effects as well as the RBE of treating
radiation, based on inactivation of a single model cell system and a typical
treating radiation in carbon-ion RT. The ERD distribution virtually represents
the biological effect of the treatment regardless of radiation modality or
fractionation scheme. We applied the ERD formulation to simplistic model
treatments and to a preclinical survey for hypofractionation based on an actual
prostate-cancer treatment of carbon-ion radiotherapy. The proposed formulation
was demonstrated to be practical and to offer theoretical implications. In the
prostate-cancer case, the ERD distribution was very similar to the
RBE-weighted-dose distribution of the actual treatment in 12 fractions. With
hypofractionation, while the RBE-weighted-dose distribution varied
significantly, the ERD distribution was nearly invariant, implying that the
carbon-ion radiotherapy would be insensitive to fractionation. However,
treatment evaluation with simplistic biological dose is intrinsically limited

heterogeneous cellular networks (HCNs). Considering that the final formulated
problem is in a sum-of-ratio form, we first need to transform it into a
parametric nonfractional form, by which we can achieve its solution through a
two-layer iterative algorithm. The outer layer searches the energy efficiency
parameters and multipliers associated with signal-interference-plus-noise-ratio
(SINR) constraints using Newton-like method, and the inner layer optimizes the
association indices using Lagrange multiplier method. In fact, the inner layer
doesn't need iterative steps when the SINR constraints are not involved in the
original problem, and then the whole algorithm should be a one-layer iterative
one. As for the two-layer iterative algorithm, we also give the corresponding
convergence proof. Numerical results show that the proposed scheme
significantly outperforms the existing one in system throughput and network
energy efficiency. In addition, we also investigate the impacts of the number
of massive antennas and the transmit power of each pico base station on these

the reduction in $k$ to some extent, which is mainly due to the reduction of
phonon lifetimes limited by the anharmonic scattering. More interesting, the
origin of the reduction in $k$ is not the anharmonic interaction but the
harmonic interaction from the depressed phonon spectrum mechanism, and for some
chemical functional atom in halogen, the flat modes appearing in the low

increasing the three-phonon scattering channels. Our work analyzes the

graph-based problems are related to many real-world applications, such as
localizing stimulus in brain connectivity networks, and mining traffic events
in city street networks, where the key issue is to find the supports of
localized activated patterns. Counterparts of these problems in classical
signal/image processing, such as impulse detection and foreground detection,
have been studied over the past few decades. We use piecewise-constant graph
signals to model localized patterns, where each piece indicates a localized
pattern that exhibits homogeneous internal behavior and the number of pieces
indicates the number of localized patterns. For such signals, we show that
decomposition and dictionary learning are natural extensions of localization,
the goal of which is not only to efficiently approximate graph signals, but
also to accurately find supports of localized patterns. For each of the three
problems, i.e., localization, decomposition, and dictionary learning, we
propose a specific graph signal model, an optimization problem, and a
computationally efficient solver. The proposed solvers directly find the
supports of arbitrary localized activated patterns without tuning any
thresholds. We then conduct an extensive empirical study to validate the
proposed methods on both simulated and real data including the analysis of a
large volume of spatio-temporal Manhattan urban data. The analysis validates
the effectiveness of the approach and suggests that graph signal processing
tools may aid in urban planning and traffic forecasting.

Al metal powders as oxygen getters can be adopted as a powerful technique for
the conversion of bismuth-doped red-emitting systems into NIR-emitting cousins

experimental characterization indicates that the framework oxygen of hosts can
be topotactically extracted, thus producing unique metal-oxygen-metal networks

parallel each other and separated by uniform intervals. Since the hyperplanes

three-dimensional $(x,y,z)$ space and they are shown by the standard computer

by means of a simple input method based on keyboard typings. The multiple
slices are placed on a parabola curve in the three-dimensional world

simple and the double rotations in the four dimensional space are applied to
the polytope. All slices synchronously change their shapes when a rotation is
applied to the polytope. The compact display in the oval of many slices with

to the absence of parent compounds for the latter family of superconductors.
Here, we report the synthesis and structure determination of two novel phases
in ethylenediamine intercalated FeSe, one is tetragonal and the other
orthorhombic in room temperature, which can be stabilized with neutral spacer
layers. Both phases can be regarded as the parent compounds for
superconductivity as they are non-superconducting (non-SC) in pristine form and
superconducting (SC) with Tc up to 38K and 46K, respectively after Na doping,
and the switch between SC and no-SC is reversible. Moreover, the two non-SC
parent compounds show no evidence of long-range magnetic ordering down to 2K,
only with dynamic spin fluctuations at low temperatures, suggesting that no
competition between SC and AFM ordering. Our results reveal that undoped iron
selenides are quantum paramagnetic in ground state, implying that they are
distinct from their pnictide counterparts in pairing mechanism.

also study Azumaya algebras over the real K-theory spectrum $KO$ which become

gravitating celestial objects. In this paper, we investigate the light curve of
a light ray that passes through the throat of an Ellis wormhole, the simplest
example of traversable wormholes. The method developed here is also applicable
to other traversable wormholes. To study whether the light curve of a light ray
that passes through a wormhole throat is distinguishable from that which does
not, we also calculate light curves without the passage of a throat for an
Ellis wormhole, a Schwarzschild black hole, and an ultrastatic wormhole with
the spatial geometry identical to that of the Schwarzschild black hole in the
following two cases: (i) ""microlensing,"" where the source, lens, and observer
are almost aligned in this order and the light ray starts at the source,
refracts in the weak gravitational field of the lens with a small deflection
angle, and reaches the observer, and (ii) ""retrolensing,"" where the source,
observer, and lens are almost aligned in this order, and the light ray starts
at the source, refracts in the vicinity of the light sphere of the lens with a
deflection angle very close to $\pi$, and reaches the observer. We find that
the light curve of the light ray that passes through the throat of the Ellis
wormhole is clearly distinguishable from that by the microlensing but not from
that by the retrolensing. This is because the light curve of a light ray that
passes by a light sphere of a lens with a large deflection angle has common
characters, irrespective of the details of the lens object. This implies that

signal $\bm{x}\in\mathbb{C}^n$ from the measurements $y_r=\lvert

reformulated as a least-squares minimization problem. Although the cost
function is nonconvex, the global convergence of gradient descent algorithm
from a random initialization is studied, when $m$ is large enough. We improve
the known result of the local convergence from a spectral initialization. When
the signal $\bm{x}$ is real-valued, we prove that the cost function is local
convex near the solution $\{\pm\bm{x}\}$. To accelerate the gradient descent,
we review and apply several efficient line search methods. We also perform a
comparative numerical study of the line search methods and the alternative
projection method. Numerical simulations demonstrate the superior ability of
LBFGS algorithm than other algorithms.

whereby each set of counter-terms introduces new divergent quantum
contributions which in turn must be subtracted by new counter-terms. This tower
of counter-terms can be constructed by recursion and allows one to calculate
the finite renormalised action of the model. In particular, the classical
action is not renormalised and the finite corrections to the renormalised
action contain only higher derivative operators. We establish an operational
criterion for classicality, where the corrections to the classical action are
negligible, and show that this is satisfied in cosmological and astrophysical
situations for (healthy) K-mouflage models which pass the solar system tests.
We also find that these models are quantum stable around astrophysical and
cosmological backgrounds. We then consider the possible embedding of the
K-mouflage models in an Ultra-Violet completion. We find that the healthy
models which pass the solar system tests all violate the positivity constraint

that these healthy K-mouflage theories have no UV completion. We then analyse
their behaviour at high energy and we find that the classicality criterion is
satisfied in the vicinity of a high energy collision implying that the
classical K-mouflage theory can be applied in this context. Moreover, the
classical description becomes more accurate as the energy increases, in a way

causes the landscape to translate, inducing direct transport of paramagnetic
particles placed above the film. The ellipticity of the applied field can be
used to control and tune the interparticle interactions, from net repulsive to

depending on their elevation above the surface of the magnetic substrate, the

mobilities. We exploit this feature to induce selective chaining for certain
values of the applied field parameters. In particular, when driving two types
of particles, we force only one type to condense into travelling parallel

the balance of pairwise magnetic forces between the particles and their

energy window of the elastic cotunneling, by destroying some symmetries of the

opposite for opposite spins, these transport channels can be well spin
polarized. Moreover, due to the helicity conservation of the topological edge
states, these three transport channels are spatially separated in three
different locations of the device, making them experimentally distinguishable.
This crossed Andreev reflection is a nonlocal quantum interference between
opposite edges through evanescent modes. If two superconducting leads with

crossed Andreev reflection can present Josephson type oscillations, with a

mothers invested more effort in feeding and allogrooming, while the putative

equivalence is an analogue of the relation between Turaev-Viro and
Reshetikhin-Turaev TQFTs and relates them to the quantisation of moduli spaces

  We show that the topological invariants of the two models, the algebra of

This is established in a gauge theoretical picture, in which both models appear

Both algebras can be viewed as the algebra of functions on gauge fields in a

isomorphism between their subalgebras of invariants, which are interpreted as
gauge invariant functions or observables. It also relates the curvatures in the
two models, which are given as holonomies around the faces of the lattice. This
yields an isomorphism between the subalgebras obtained by projecting out

penalization method for factor analysis models. The penalty is based on the
product of a pair of elements in each row of the loading matrix. The prenet not
only shrinks some of the factor loadings toward exactly zero, but also enhances
the simplicity of the loading matrix, which plays an important role in the
interpretation of the common factors. In particular, with a large amount of
prenet penalization, the estimated loading matrix possesses a perfect simple
structure, which is known as a desirable structure in terms of the simplicity
of the loading matrix. Furthermore, the perfect simple structure estimation via
the prenet turns out to be a generalization of the $k$-means clustering of
variables. On the other hand, a mild amount of the penalization approximates a
loading matrix estimated by the quartimin rotation, one of the most commonly
used oblique rotation techniques. Thus, the proposed penalty bridges a gap
between the perfect simple structure and the quartimin rotation. Monte Carlo
simulation is conducted to investigate the performance of the proposed
procedure. Three real data analyses are given to illustrate the usefulness of

carry out large-scale measurement studies on how users access and view
webpages. Our measurement results demonstrate the challenges (e.g., peers stay
on a webpage extremely short) that can not be directly solved by conventional
P2P strategies, and some important webpage viewing patterns. Due to these
unique characteristics, WebRTC peers open up new possibilities for helping the
web content delivery, coming with the problem of how to utilize the dynamic
resources efficiently. We formulate the peer selection that is the critical
strategy in our framework, as an optimization problem, and design a heuristic
algorithm based on the measurement insights to solve it. Our simulation
experiments driven by the traces from Tencent QZone demonstrate the
effectiveness of our design: compared with non-peer-assisted strategy and
random peer selection strategy, our design significantly improves the
successful relay ratio of web content items under network failures, e.g., our
design improves the content download ratio up to 60% even when users located in

We show that, the detuning parameter has a positive role in the protection of

find that for the values of detuning parameter less than the cavity damping
rate, the quantum Zeno effect is always dominant, while for the values greater

set theory and specially suited for domain theory. Our approximation operators
offer a fresh perspective to existing concepts and results in domain theory,
but also reveal ways to establishing novel domain-theoretic results. For
instance, (1) the well-known interpolation property of the way-below relation
on a continuous poset is equivalent to the idempotence of a certain
set-operator; (2) the continuity of a poset can be characterized by the
coincidence of the Scott closure operator and the upper approximation operator
induced by the way below relation; (3) meet-continuity can be established from
a certain property of the topological closure operator. Additionally, we show
how, to each approximating relation, an associated order-compatible topology
can be defined in such a way that for the case of a continuous poset the
topology associated to the way-below relation is exactly the Scott topology. A
preliminary investigation is carried out on this new topology.

approximation algorithms for computing complex-valued evaluations of a large
class of graph polynomials on bounded degree graphs. In particular, our
approach works for the Tutte polynomial and independence polynomial, as well as
partition functions of complex-valued spin and edge-coloring models.
  More specifically, we define a large class of graph polynomials $\mathcal C$
and show that if $p\in \cal C$ and there is a disk $D$ centered at zero in the
complex plane such that $p(G)$ does not vanish on $D$ for all bounded degree
graphs $G$, then for each $z$ in the interior of $D$ there exists a
deterministic polynomial-time approximation algorithm for evaluating $p(G)$ at
$z$. This gives an explicit connection between absence of zeros of graph
polynomials and the existence of efficient approximation algorithms, allowing
us to show new relationships between well-known conjectures.
  Our work builds on a recent line of work initiated by. Barvinok, which
provides a new algorithmic approach besides the existing Markov chain Monte
Carlo method and the correlation decay method for these types of problems.

observed intermittently at intervals of about 15 min in the post-midnight
sector (01:55-02:40 MLT) by all-sky imagers and magnetometers in northern
Europe. It was deduced that each surge occurred just after each onset of a
multiple-onset substorm, which was small-scale and did not clearly expand
westward, because they were observed almost simultaneously with Pi 2 pulsations
at the magnetic equator and magnetic bay variations at middle-to-high latitudes
associated with the DP-1 current system. The EEASs showed similar properties to
omega bands or torches reported in previous studies, such as recurrence
intervals of about 15 min, concurrence with magnetic pulsations with amplitudes
of several tens of nanotesla, horizontal scales of 300-400 km, and occurrence
of a pulsating aurora in a diffuse aurora after the passage of the EEASs.
Furthermore, the EEASs showed similar temporal evolution to the omega bands,
during which eastward-propagating auroral streamers occurred simultaneously in
the poleward region, followed by the formation of north-south-aligned auroras,
which eventually connected with the EEASs. Thus, we speculate that EEASs may be
related to the generation process of omega bands. (Continued)

SUSY theories are not yet fully understood, and numerical study of SUSY
theories through lattice simulations is promising as regards furthering this

popular paradigm for video streaming [13], in which a video is segmented into
many chunks delivered to users by HTTP request/response over Transmission
Control Protocol (TCP) con- nections. Therefore, it is intriguing to study the
performance of strategies implemented in conventional TCPs, which are not
dedicated for video streaming, e.g., whether chunks are efficiently delivered
when users per- form interactions with the video players. In this paper, we
conduct mea- surement studies on users chunk requesting traces in DASH from a
rep- resentative video streaming provider, to investigate users behaviors in
DASH, and TCP-connection-level traces from CDN servers, to investi- gate the
performance of TCP for DASH. By studying how video chunks are delivered in both
the slow start and congestion avoidance phases, our observations have revealed
the performance characteristics of TCP for DASH as follows: (1) Request
patterns in DASH have a great impact on the performance of TCP variations
including cubic; (2) Strategies in conventional TCPs may cause user perceived
quality degradation in DASH streaming; (3) Potential improvement to TCP
strategies for better delivery in DASH can be further explored.

about pure AdS is given by a perturbative expansion of the area functional in
terms of the change in the bulk metric and the embedded extremal surface.
However it is known that change in the embedding appear at second order or
higher. In this paper we show that these changes in the embedding can be
systematically calculated in the 2+1 dimensional case by accounting for the
deviation of the spacelike geodesics between a spacetime and perturbations over
it. Here we consider rotating BTZ as perturbation over $AdS_3$ and study
deviations of spacelike geodesics in them. We argue that these deviations arise
naturally as solutions of a ""generalized geodesic deviation equation"". Using
this we perturbatively calculate the changes in HEE upto second order, for
rotating BTZ. This expression matches with the small system size expansion of
the change in HEE obtained by HRT (Hubeny, Rangamani and Takayanagi) proposal
for rotating BTZ. We also write an alternative form of entanglement first law
for rotating BTZ. To do this one needs to go beyond the leading order in the
perturbation series discussed above. That's precisely the reason we consider
finding a systematic way to calculate it. To put our result on a firm footing
we further show that it is this alternative first law that approaches the
thermal first law in the large subsystem size limit.

constraint for the $L^2$-Wasserstein distance is relaxed by introducing a

the path energy by means of its squared $L^2$-norm in time of a functional with
linear growth in space. This extension of the original transport model enables
local density modulation, which is a desirable feature in applications such as
image warping and blending. A key advantage of the use of a functional with
linear growth in space is that it allows for singular sources and sinks, which
can be supported on points or lines. On a technical level, the $L^2$-norm in
time ensures a disintegration of the source in time, which we use to obtain the
well-posedness of the model and the existence of geodesic paths. Furthermore, a
numerical scheme based on the proximal splitting approach (Papadakis et al.,

separated from stars and quasars through colour cuts, which may leave
imperfections because of mixing different source types which overlap in colour
space. The aim of the present work is to identify galaxies in the
WISExSuperCOSMOS catalogue through an alternative approach of machine learning.
This allows us to define more complex separations in the multi-colour space
than possible with simple colour cuts, and should provide more reliable source
classification. For the automatised classification we use the support vector
machines learning algorithm, employing SDSS spectroscopic sources cross-matched
with WISExSuperCOSMOS as the training and verification set. We perform a number
of tests to examine the behaviour of the classifier (completeness, purity and
accuracy) as a function of source apparent magnitude and Galactic latitude. We
then apply the classifier to the full-sky data and analyse the resulting
catalogue of candidate galaxies. We also compare thus produced dataset with the
one presented in B16. The tests indicate very high accuracy, completeness and
purity (>95%) of the classifier at the bright end, deteriorating for the
faintest sources, but still retaining acceptable levels of 85%. No significant
variation of classification quality with Galactic latitude is observed.
Application of the classifier to all-sky WISExSuperCOSMOS data gives 15 million
galaxies after masking problematic areas. The resulting sample is purer than
the one in B16, at a price of lower completeness over the sky. The automatic

little difference between hemispheres. In practice, the I_N plates are
shallower than the B_J & R_F plates, so for most purposes we advocate the use
of a catalogue selected in these two latter bands. At high Galactic latitudes,
this catalogue is approximately 90% complete with 5% stellar contamination; we
quantify how the quality degrades towards the Galactic plane. At low latitudes,
there are many spurious galaxy candidates resulting from stellar blends: these
approximately match the surface density of true galaxies at |b|=30 deg. Above
this latitude, the catalogue limited in B_J & R_F contains in total about 20
million galaxy candidates, of which 75% are real. This contamination can be

to study and characterize the behavior of WISE source populations in
anticipation of the deep multi-wavelength surveys that will define the next
decade, with the principal science goal of mapping the 3D large scale
structures and determining the global physical attributes of the host galaxies.
In combination with cosmological redshifts, we identify galaxies from their
WISE W1 3.4um resolved emission, and by performing a star-galaxy separation
using apparent magnitude, colors and statistical modeling of star-counts. The
resultant galaxy catalog has ~590,000 sources in 60 deg^2, reaching a W1
5-sigma depth of 31 uJy. At the faint end, where redshifts are not available,
we employ a luminosity function analysis to show that approximately 27% of all
WISE extragalactic sources to a limit of 17.5 mag (31 uJy) are at high
redshift, z > 1. The spatial distribution is investigated using two-point
correlation functions and a 3D source density characterization at 5 Mpc and 20
Mpc scales. For angular distributions, we find brighter and more massive
sources are strongly clustered relative to fainter and lower mass source;
likewise, based on WISE colors, spheroidal galaxies have the strongest
clustering, while late-type disk galaxies have the lowest clustering
amplitudes. Along the radial direction, the strongest clustering is in the
largest redshift shell, while the weakest is in the nearest redshift shell,
consistent with the stellar mass and morphological type dependency results. In
three dimensions, we find a number of distinct groupings, often bridged by
filaments and super-structures. Using special visualization tools, we map these

  ARMA Model Estimation",,,"10.1109/TSP.2016.2634539",,"stat.ME","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  A new robust and statistically efficient estimator for ARMA models called the
bounded influence propagation (BIP) {\tau}-estimator is proposed. The estimator
incorporates an auxiliary model, which prevents the propagation of outliers.
Strong consistency and asymptotic normality of the estimator for ARMA models
that are driven by independently and identically distributed (iid) innovations
with symmetric distributions are established. To analyze the infinitesimal
effect of outliers on the estimator, the influence function is derived and
computed explicitly for an AR(1) model with additive outliers. To obtain
estimates for the AR(p) model, a robust Durbin-Levinson type and a
forward-backward algorithm are proposed. An iterative algorithm to robustly
obtain ARMA(p,q) parameter estimates is also presented. The problem of finding
a robust initialization is addressed, which for orders p+q>2 is a non-trivial
matter. Numerical experiments are conducted to compare the finite sample
performance of the proposed estimator to existing robust methodologies for
different types of outliers both in terms of average and of worst-case
performance, as measured by the maximum bias curve. To illustrate the practical
applicability of the proposed estimator, a real-data example of outlier
cleaning for R-R interval plots derived from electrocardiographic (ECG) data is
considered. The proposed estimator is not limited to biomedical applications,
but is also useful in any real-world problem whose observations can be modeled
as an ARMA process disturbed by outliers or impulsive noise.

magneto-optical effects and birefringent materials. Here we present
measurements of non-reciprocal transmission and spontaneous symmetry breaking
between counter-propagating light in dielectric microresonators. The symmetry
breaking corresponds to a resonance frequency splitting that allows only one of
two counter-propagating (but otherwise identical) light waves to circulate in
the resonator. Equivalently, the symmetry breaking can be seen as the collapse
of standing waves and transition to travelling waves within the resonator. We
present theoretical calculations to show that the symmetry breaking is induced
by Kerr-nonlinearity-mediated interaction between the counter-propagating
light. This effect is expected to take place in any dielectric ring-resonator
and might constitute one of the most fundamental ways to induce optical
non-reciprocity. Our findings pave the way for a variety of applications

controllable circulators and isolators, optical flip-flops for photonic

symmetry alleviates the effects of structural imperfections and guaranties a
high level of resonant transmission for low intensity radiation. At high
intensity, the light-induced absorption can suppress the localised modes, along
with the resonant transmission. In this case the entire photonic structure
becomes highly reflective within a broad frequency range, thus increasing
dramatically the damage threshold of the limiter. Here we demonstrate
experimentally the principle of operation of such photonic structures using a
waveguide consisting of coupled dielectric microwave resonators.

underpredict the data (more in the neutrino than in the antineutrino case)

curves with isomorphic $p$-torsion modules $E[p]$ and $E'[p]$. Assume further
that either (i) every $G_\mathbb{Q}$-modules isomorphism $\phi : E[p] \to
E'[p]$ admits a multiple $\lambda \cdot \phi$ with $\lambda \in
\mathbb{F}_p^\times$ preserving the Weil pairing; or (ii) no
$G_\mathbb{Q}$-isomorphism $\phi : E[p] \to E'[p]$ preserves the Weil pairing.
This paper considers the problem of deciding if we are in case (i) or (ii).
  Our approach is to consider the problem locally at a prime $\ell \neq p$.
Firstly, we determine the primes $\ell$ for which the local curves
$E/\mathbb{Q}_\ell$ and $E'/\mathbb{Q}_\ell$ contain enough information to
decide between (i) or (ii). Secondly, we establish a collection of criteria, in
terms of the standard invariants associated to minimal Weierstrass models of
$E/\mathbb{Q}_\ell$ and $E'/\mathbb{Q}_\ell$, to decide between (i) and (ii).
We show that our results give a complete solution to the problem by local
methods away from $p$.
  We apply our methods to show the non-existence of rational points on certain
hyperelliptic curves of the form $y^2 = x^p - \ell$ and $y^2 = x^p - 2\ell$
where $\ell$ is a prime; we also give incremental results on the Fermat
equation $x^2 + y^3 = z^p$. As a different application, we discuss variants of
a question raised by Mazur concerning the existence of symplectic isomorphisms
between the $p$-torsion of two non-isogenous elliptic curves defined over
$\mathbb{Q}$.

from electron vortex beams, spin polarized electron beams and beams with phase
aberrations are considered, as they pass through ferromagnetic FePt or

far from achieving the goal of an active observer relying upon eye guidance to
accomplish real-world tasks. We argue that this challenging goal not only
requires to embody, in a principled way, the problem of eye guidance within the

and sqrt(T) dependency of the resistivity are observed at x ~ 0.17 and 0.41,
respectively. The sign change of RH without opening of the spin-density-wave
gap for 0.45 < x < 0.58 and T < TN as well as the calculated non-nested Fermi
surface at x = 0.5 indicate the more localized nature of the AF2 as compared to
spin density wave phase at non-doped sample. Considering the results from band
calculations and the finite size of Hund' s rule coupling, the change of the
normal conducting state with x is reasonably explained by a strong depression
of the coherent scale owing to the increased effective Coulomb repulsion in the
narrow anti-bonding 3dxy band that approaches the half-filled regime. The
following transition from the paramagnet to AF2 is understood as the quenching
or ordering of the less-screened spins with a large entropy at low temperature.
These results suggest that the normal conducting properties over a wide doping
range for the LaFeAsO1-xHx are strongly influenced by the local spins in the
incoherent region. Thus, we conclude that the parent phase in LaFeAsO1-xHx is
not the spin-density wave but the AF2, which may be primarily responsible for
the singular superconducting properties of the 1111 type compared with other
iron pnictides.

first structure plays a central role in the theory of time-dependent
Hamiltonians, whilst the second is here used to treat classical Hamiltonians
including dissipation terms.
  On the other hand, the interest of a geometric Hamilton--Jacobi equation is
the primordial observation that a Hamiltonian vector field $X_{H}$ can be
projected into the configuration manifold by means of a 1-form $dW$, then the
integral curves of the projected vector field $X_{H}^{dW}$can be transformed
into integral curves of $X_{H}$ provided that $W$ is a solution of the
Hamilton--Jacobi equation.
  In this way, we use the geometric Hamilton--Jacobi theory to derive solutions
of physical systems with a Hamiltonian formulation. A new expression for a
geometric Hamilton Jacobi equation is obtained for time dependent Hamiltonians
described with the aid of a cosymplectic structure. Then, another expression
for the Hamilton Jacobi equation is retrieved for Hamiltonians with frictional
terms described through contact geometry. Both approaches shall be applied to

and are a subject of great interest in current research. Due to their higher
density compared to the carrier fluid, inertial particles tend to form high
concentration regions, i.e. clusters, and low concentration regions, i.e.
voids, due to the interaction with the turbulence. In this work, we present an
experimental investigation of the clustering phenomenon of heavy sub-Kolmogorov
particles in homogeneous isotropic turbulent flows. Three control parameters
have been varied over significant ranges: $Re_{\lambda} \in [170 - 450]$,
$St\in [0.1 - 5]$ and volume fraction $\phi_v\in [2\times 10^{-6} - 2\times
10^{-5}]$. The scaling of clustering characteristics, such as the distribution
of Vorono\""i areas and the dimensions of cluster and void regions, with the
three parameters are discussed. In particular, for the polydispersed size
distributions considered here, clustering is found to be enhanced strongly
(quasi-linearly) by $Re_{\lambda}$ and noticeably (with a square-root
dependency) with $\phi_v$, while the cluster and void sizes, scaled with the
Kolmogorov lengthscale $\eta$, are driven primarily by $Re_{\lambda}$. Cluster
length $\sqrt{\langle A_c \rangle}$ scales up to $\approx 100 {\eta}$, measured
at the highest $Re_{\lambda}$, while void length $\sqrt{\langle A_v \rangle}$
scaled also with $\eta$ is typically two times larger ($\approx 200 {\eta}$).
The lack of sensitivity of the above characteristics to the Stokes number lends

Classical homology is a computable topological invariant because of the
Mayer-Vietoris exact and spectral sequences associated to coverings of a space.
We state and prove versions of the Mayer-Vietoris theorem for persistent
homology under mild and commonplace assumptions. This is done through the use
of a new theory, the singular persistent homology, better suited for handling
coverings of data sets. As an application, we create a distributed
computational workflow where the advantage is not only or even primarily in
speed improvement but in sheer feasibility for large data sets.

introducing an appropriate $U(1)$ gauge background associated with the
$U(1)_{V}$ symmetry. We then show that the generalized Sugino model on the
discretized curved space, which was proposed in our previous work, can be
identified to the discretization of this SUSY enhanced theory, where one of the
supersymmetries remains and the other is broken but restored in the continuum
limit. We find that the $U(1)_{A}$ anomaly exists also in the discretized

to the Euler characteristics of the polyhedra. We then study this model by
using the numerical Monte-Carlo simulation. We propose a novel phase-quench
method called ""anomaly-phase-quenched approximation"" with respect to the
$U(1)_A$ anomaly. We numerically show that the Ward-Takahashi (WT) identity
associated with the remaining supersymmetry is realized by adopting this
approximation. We figure out the relation between the sign (phase) problem and
pseudo-zero-modes of the Dirac operator. We also show that the divergent

servers to deliver video chunks through different Internet Service Providers
(ISPs), to achieve an improved quality of service (QoS) for video streaming
users. However, since traditional strategies for a multihoming video CDN are
simply designed according to static rules, e.g., simply sending traffic via a
ISP which is the same as the ISP of client, they fail to dynamically allocate
resources among different ISPs over time. In this paper, we perform measurement
studies to demonstrate that such static allocation mechanism is inefficient to
make full utilization of multiple ISPs' resources. To address this problem, we
propose a dynamic flow scheduling strategy for multihoming video CDN. The
challenge is to find the control parameters that can guide the ISP selection
when performing flow scheduling. Using a data-driven approach, we find factors
that have a major impact on the performance improvement in the dynamic flow
scheduling. We further utilize an information gain approach to generate
parameter combinations that can be used to guide the flow scheduling, i.e., to
determine the ISP each request should be responded by. Our evaluation results
demonstrate that our design effectively performs the flow scheduling. In
particular, our design yields near optimal performance in a simulation of
real-world multihoming setup.

use the higher-than-present long-term S$_{\rm{MWO}}$ average of 0.18 for the

grow to approximately lunar mass, a large high-speed impact can generate an
intact melt region that allows the dense material to gravitationally segregate,
forming a large density anomaly. If this anomaly generates sufficient
differential stress, it rapidly segregates to the object's center, triggering
whole body differentiation. We used an impact melting model based on the
Hugoniot equations, the linear shock-particle velocity relationship, and the
empirical relationship between shock pressure and distance coupled with a Monte
Carlo simulation of the late accretion process to determine conditions under
which large impacts trigger differentiation in icy bodies. In a gas-free
environment, impacts of projectiles in the satellite's accretion zone have a
small probability of triggering differentiation in surviving proto-satellites
as small as Triton. The probability increases to 100% by the time surviving
proto-satellites grow to the mass of Europa. The impact of heliocentric
particles captured by the central planet also effectively triggers
differentiation in the icy satellites. If the largest projectiles in the
heliocentric distribution are comparable to the mass of the growing satellites,
they trigger differentiation in all surviving proto-satellites by the time they
grow to the mass of Callisto. However, Callisto and Ganymede have different
probabilities of impact-induced differentiation if they captured a small
fraction (0.01 and 0.5%) of the particles they accreted from a distribution of
small (largest particles ~10% of the satellite's mass) heliocentric objects.
Impact induced differentiation explains the apparent difference between these
two objects in a plausible way.

accompanied by an enhancement of the orthorhombic distortion $\delta$ below

of quantum information theory and resource theories. So far, the resource
theories utilised to describe thermodynamics have assumed the existence of an
infinite thermal reservoir, by declaring that thermal states at some background
temperature come for free. Here, we propose a resource theory of quantum
thermodynamics without a background temperature, so that no states at all come
for free. We apply this resource theory to the case of many non-interacting
systems, and show that all quantum states are classified by their entropy and
average energy, even arbitrarily far away from equilibrium. This implies that
thermodynamics takes place in a two-dimensional convex set that we call the
energy-entropy diagram. The answers to many resource-theoretic questions about
thermodynamics can be read off from this diagram, such as the efficiency of a
heat engine consisting of finite reservoirs, or the rate of conversion between
two states. This allows us to consider a resource theory which puts work and
heat on an equal footing, and serves as a model for other resource theories.

utilize this NFT and its inverse to (de-)modulate data. Fast algorithms for the

continuous spectrum is null have been reported in the literature. In this
paper, we investigate the complementary case and propose the first fast inverse

transmitters in the recently proposed nonlinear inverse synthesis scheme, but
the problem also occurs in different application areas such as fiber Bragg

an order of magnitude faster than the current state of the art,

$\mathcal{I}$ is the wave momentum and $0< \mu < \mu_0$, where $\mu_0$ is

stability of the set $D_\mu$ of minimisers: solutions starting near $D_\mu$
remain close to $D_\mu$ in a suitably defined energy space over their interval
of existence. The solitary waves which we construct are of small amplitude and
are to leading order described by the cubic nonlinear Schr\""odinger equation.
They exist in a parameter region in which the `slow' branch of the dispersion
relation has a strict non-degenerate global minimum and the corresponding
nonlinear Schr\""odinger equation is of focussing type. We show that the waves
detected by our variational method converge (after an appropriate rescaling) to

obtain spatially continuous ground-level PM2.5 concentrations, several models
established by point-surface fusion of ground station and satellite
observations have been developed. However, how well do these models perform at
national scale in China? Is there space to improve the estimation accuracy of
PM2.5 concentration? The contribution of this study is threefold. Firstly,
taking advantage of the newly established national monitoring network, we
develop a national-scale generalized regression neural network (GRNN) model to
estimate PM2.5 concentrations. Secondly, different assessment experiments are
undertaken in time and space, to comprehensively evaluate and compare the
performance of the widely used models. Finally, to map the yearly and seasonal
mean distribution of PM2.5 concentrations in China, a pixel-based merging
strategy is proposed. The results indicate that the conventional models (linear
regression, multiple linear regression, and semi-empirical model) do not
perform well at national scale, with cross-validation R values of 0.488~0.552
and RMSEs of 30.80~31.51 {\mu}g/m3, respectively. In contrast, the more
advanced models (geographically weighted regression, back-propagation neural
network, and GRNN) have great advantages in PM2.5 estimation, with R values
ranging from 0.610 to 0.816 and RMSEs from 20.93 to 28.68 {\mu}g/m3,
respectively. In particular, the proposed GRNN model obtains the best
performance. Furthermore, the mapped PM2.5 distribution retrieved from 3-km
MODIS aerosol optical depth (AOD) products, agrees quite well with the station
measurements. The results also show that our study has the capacity to provide
reasonable information for the global monitoring of PM2.5 pollution in China.

resulting in periodic, regular motion along particular directions. Light
reflected by the charge will be partially polarized, and this will imprint a
characteristic pattern on the CMB. We study this effect by considering a simple
model in which anisotropic incident electromagnetic (EM) radiation is
rescattered by a charge sitting in spacetime perturbed by GWs and becomes
polarized. As the charge is driven to move along particular directions, we
calculate its dipole moment to determine the leading-order rescattered EM
radiation. The Stokes parameters of the rescattered radiation exhibit a net
linear polarization. We investigate how this polarization effect can be
schematically represented out of the Stokes parameters. We work out the
representations of gradient modes (E-modes) and curl modes (B-modes) to produce
polarization maps. Although the polarization effect results from GWs, we find
that its representations, the E- and B-modes, do not practically reflect the GW
properties such as strain amplitude, frequency and polarization states.

directed relation graph with error propagation (DRGEP), by first applying DRGEP
to efficiently remove many unimportant species prior to sensitivity analysis to
further remove unimportant species, producing an optimally small skeletal
mechanism for a given error limit. It is illustrated that the combination of
the DRGEP and DRGASA methods allows the DRGEPSA approach to overcome the
weaknesses of each, specifically that DRGEP cannot identify all unimportant
species and that DRGASA shields unimportant species from removal. Skeletal

through a network via user-to-user interaction. The Spatial Preferred
Attachment (SPA) model is a random graph model for complex networks: vertices
are placed in a metric space, and the link probability depends on the metric
distance between vertices, and on their degree. We show that the SPA model
typically produces graphs that have small effective diameter, i.e. $O(\log^2
n)$, while rumour spreading is relatively slow, namely polynomial in $n$.
