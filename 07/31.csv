makes the search easier. For a discrete-time quantum walk searching a graph for
a marked vertex, however, additional marked vertices can make the search harder
by causing the system to approximately begin in a stationary state, so the
system fails to evolve. In this paper, we completely characterize the
stationary states, or 1-eigenvectors, of the quantum walk search operator for
general graphs and configurations of marked vertices by decomposing their
amplitudes into uniform and flip states. This infinitely expands the number of
known stationary states and gives an optimization procedure to find the
stationary state closest to the initial uniform state of the walk. We further
prove theorems on the existence of stationary states, with them conditionally
existing if the marked vertices form a bipartite connected component and always
existing if non-bipartite. These results utilize the standard oracle in
Grover's algorithm, but we show that a different type of oracle prevents
stationary states from interfering with the search algorithm.

Given a linear Datalog program DB written using N constants and binary
predicates, we first translate if-and-only-if completions of clauses in DB into
a set Eq(DB) of matrix equations with a non-linear operation where relations in
M_DB, the least Herbrand model of DB, are encoded as adjacency matrices. We
then translate Eq(DB) into another, but purely linear matrix equations
tilde_Eq(DB). It is proved that the least solution of tilde_Eq(DB) in the sense
of matrix ordering is converted to the least solution of Eq(DB) and the latter
gives M_DB as a set of adjacency matrices. Hence computing the least solution
of tilde_Eq(DB) is equivalent to computing M_DB specified by DB. For a class of
tail recursive programs and for some other types of programs, our approach
achieves O(N^3) time complexity irrespective of the number of variables in a
clause since only matrix operations costing O(N^3) or less are used.
  We conducted two experiments that compute the least Herbrand models of linear
Datalog programs. The first experiment computes transitive closure of
artificial data and real network data taken from the Koblenz Network
Collection. The second one compared the proposed approach with the
state-of-the-art symbolic systems including two Prolog systems and two ASP
systems, in terms of computation time for a transitive closure program and the
same generation program. In the experiment, it is observed that our linear
algebraic approach runs 10^1 ~ 10^4 times faster than the symbolic systems when
data is not sparse. To appear in Theory and Practice of Logic Programming

pursuing the usual path-integral method in a singular space, we attempt to
study the wavefunctions in detail. We begin with a toy model of multiple
particles whose interaction potential admits multiple minima. We study the
entanglement of the true ground state after taking the tunnelling effects into
account and find some simple patterns. Notably, in the case of multiple
particle interactions, entanglement entropy generically decreases with
increasing number of minima. The knowledge of the subsystem actually increases
with the number of minima. The reduced density matrix can also be seen to have
close connections with graph spectra. In a more careful study of the two-well
tunnelling system, we also extract the exponentially suppressed tail
contribution, the analogues of instantons. To understand the effects of
multiple minima in a field theory, it inspires us to inspect wavefunctions in a
toy model of bosonic field describing quasi-particles of two different
condensates related by Bogoliubov transformations. We find that the area law is
naturally preserved. This is probably a useful set of perspectives that promise
wider applications.

label accuracy. We address the problem of simultaneously learning multiple

We assume that there is an additional source of information that provides a
score for each instance which reflects the certainty about its label. Modeling
this score as being generated by an underlying ranking function, we augment the
MTL framework with an added layer of supervision. This results in new MTL
methods that are able to learn accurate classifiers while preserving the domain

task of detecting abnormal cortical regions in the MRIs of patients suffering
from focal epilepsy whose MRI were read as normal by expert neuroradiologists.

varying the complex structure of the torus, the string scale is limited to be

is corrupted by the heterogeneities. Such corruption limits the performance of
imaging or communication schemes. One may then ask the question: is there an
optimal way of encoding a signal so as to counteract the corruption by the
medium? In the ideal situation the answer is given by time reversal: for a
given target or focusing point, in a first step let the target emit a signal
and then record the signal transmitted to the source antenna, time reverse this
and use it as the source trace at the source antenna in a second step. This
source will give a sharply focused wave at the target location if the source
aperture is large enough. Here we address this scheme in the more practical
situation with a limited aperture, time-harmonic signal, and finite-sized
elements in the source array. Central questions are then the focusing
resolution and signal-to-noise ratio at the target, their dependence on the
physical parameters, and the capacity to focus selectively in the neighborhood
of the target point and therefore to transmit images. Sharp results are
presented for these questions.

as special cases of the coupon collector problem, most simply expressed as the
number of coupons that must be collected to have a complete set. We aimed to
apply the coupon collector model in a comprehensive manner to one example
-hosts (balls) being searched (draws) and parasitized (ball color change) by
parasitic wasps- to evaluate the influence of differences in sampling
probabilities between items on collection speed.
  Based on the model of a complete multinomial process over time, we define the
distribution, distribution function, expectation and variance of the number of
hosts parasitized after a given time, as well as the inverse problem,
estimating the sampling effort. We develop the relationship between the risk
distribution on the set of hosts and the speed of parasitization and propose a
more elegant proof of the weak stochastic dominance among speed of
parasitization, using the concept of Schur convexity and the ""Robin Hood
transfer"" numerical operation.
  Numerical examples are provided and a conjecture about strong dominance is
proposed. The speed at which new items are discovered is a function of the
entire shape of the sampling probability distribution. The sole comparison of
values of variances is not sufficient to compare speeds associated to two
different distributions, as generally assumed in ecological studies.

use in computing environments that involve networks of heterogeneous and
resource-constrained, low-power embedded compute and sensing nodes. We present
a generalization of the classical linear detection cascade to the case of
tree-structured cascades where different branches of the tree execute on
different physical compute nodes in the network. Different nodes have access to
different features, as well as access to potentially different computation and
energy resources. We concentrate on the problem of jointly learning the
parameters for all of the classifiers in the cascade given a fixed cascade
architecture and a known set of costs required to carry out the computation at
each node.To accomplish the objective of joint learning of all detectors, we
propose a novel approach to combining classifier outputs during training that
better matches the hard cascade setting in which the learned system will be
deployed. This work is motivated by research in the area of mobile health where
energy efficient real time detectors integrating information from multiple
wireless on-body sensors and a smart phone are needed for real-time monitoring
and delivering just- in-time adaptive interventions. We apply our framework to
two activity recognition datasets as well as the problem of cigarette smoking
detection from a combination of wrist-worn actigraphy data and respiration
chest band data.

ground-level query image by matching to a reference database of overhead (e.g.

pairs of street view and overhead images sampled from eleven U.S. cities. We
explore several deep CNN architectures for cross-domain matching --
Classification, Hybrid, Siamese, and Triplet networks. Classification and
Hybrid architectures are accurate but slow since they allow only partial
feature precomputation. We propose a new loss function which significantly
improves the accuracy of Siamese and Triplet embedding networks while
maintaining their applicability to large-scale retrieval tasks like image
geolocalization. This image matching task is challenging not just because of
the dramatic viewpoint difference between ground-level and overhead imagery but
because the orientation (i.e. azimuth) of the street views is unknown making
correspondence even more difficult. We examine several mechanisms to match in
spite of this -- training for rotation invariance, sampling possible rotations
at query time, and explicitly predicting relative rotation of ground and
overhead images with our deep networks. It turns out that explicit orientation
supervision also improves location prediction accuracy. Our best performing
architectures are roughly 2.5 times as accurate as the commonly used Siamese

important to account for their behavior when considering the distribution of
detected events. In particular, the LIGO detectors are most sensitive to
sources above North America and the Indian Ocean and, as the Earth rotates, the
sensitive regions are swept across the sky. However, because the detectors do
not acquire data uniformly over time, there is a net bias on detectable
sources' right ascensions. Both LIGO detectors preferentially collect data
during their local night; it is more than twice as likely to be local midnight
than noon when both detectors are operating. We discuss these selection effects
and how they impact LIGO's observations and electromagnetic follow-up. Beyond
galactic foregrounds associated with seasonal variations, we find that
equatorial observatories can access over $80\%$ of the localization
probability, while mid-latitudes will access closer to $70\%$. Facilities
located near the two LIGO sites can observe sources closer to their zenith than
their analogs in the South, but the average observation will still be no closer
than $44^\circ$ from zenith. We also find that observatories in Africa or the
South Atlantic will wait systematically longer before they can begin observing
compared to the rest of the world, although there is a preference for
longitudes near the LIGOs. These effects, along with knowledge of the LIGO
antenna pattern, can inform electromagnetic follow-up activities and
optimization, including the possibility of directing observations even before
gravitational-wave events occur.

context of mimetic $F(R)$ gravity with potential. The issue of dark energy
oscillations can be a problem in some models of ordinary $F(R)$ gravity and a
remedy that can make the oscillations milder is to introduce additional
modifications in the functional form of the $F(R)$ gravity. As we demonstrate
the power-law modifications are not necessary in the mimetic $F(R)$ case, and
by appropriately choosing the mimetic potential and the Lagrange multiplier, it
is possible to make the oscillations almost to vanish at the end of the matter
domination era and during the late-time acceleration era. We examine the
behavior of the dark energy equation of state parameter and of the total
effective equation of state parameter as functions of the redshift and we
compare the resulting picture with the ordinary $F(R)$ gravity case. As we also
show, the present day values of the dark energy equation of state parameter and
of the total effective equation of state parameter are in better agreement with
the observational data, in comparison to the ordinary $F(R)$ gravity case.
Finally, we study the evolution of the growth factor as a function of the
redshift for all the mimetic models we shall use.

Ohno empirically stumbled on an astoundingly simple identity
relating the number of cubic rings $h(D)$ of a given discriminant $D$, over the

every element has trace divisible by 3: $h'(D) = h(D)$, if $D < 0$, and $h'(D)
= 3h(D)$ if $D > 0$, where in each case, rings are weighted by the reciprocal
of their number of automorphisms. This allows the functional equations
governing the analytic continuation of the Shintani zeta functions (the
Dirichlet series built from the values of $h$ and $h'$) to be put in
self-reflective form. In 1998, J. Nakagawa verified Ohno's conjecture. We

Prior crossing results date back to J. Cardy's prediction of a formula for the
probability that a percolation cluster in two dimensions connects the left and
right sides of a rectangle at the percolation critical point in the continuum
limit. Here, we predict a new formula for crossing probabilities of a continuum
limit loop-gas model on a planar lattice inside a $2N$-sided polygon. In this
model, boundary loops exit and then re-enter the polygon through its vertices,
with exactly one loop passing once through each vertex, and these loops join
the vertices pairwise in some specified connectivity through the polygon's
exterior. The boundary loops also connect the vertices through the interior,
which we regard as a crossing event. For particular values of the loop
fugacity, this formula specializes to FK cluster (resp. spin cluster) crossing
probabilities of a critical $Q$-state random cluster (resp. Potts) model on a
lattice inside the polygon in the continuum limit. This includes critical
percolation as the $Q=1$ random cluster model. These latter crossing
probabilities are conditioned on a particular side-alternating free/fixed
(resp. fluctuating/fixed) boundary condition on the polygon's perimeter,
related to how the boundary loops join the polygon's vertices pairwise through
the polygon's exterior in the associated loop-gas model. For $Q\in\{2,3,4\}$,
we compare our predictions of these random cluster (resp. Potts) model crossing
probabilities in a rectangle ($N=2$) and in a hexagon ($N=3$) with
high-precision computer simulation measurements. We find that the measurements
agree with our predictions very well for $Q\in\{2,3\}$ and reasonably well if
$Q=4$.

superflares is expressed as a power-law function of flare energy ($E$) with the
index of -1.5 for $10^{33}<E<10^{36}$erg. Most of the superflare stars show
quasi-periodic light variations with the amplitude of a few percent, which can
be explained by the rotation of the star with large starspots. The bolometric
energy released by flares is consistent with the magnetic energy stored around
such large starspots. Furthermore, our analyses indicate that the occurrence
frequency of superflares depends on the rotation period, and that the flare
frequency increases as the rotation period decreases. However, the energy of
the largest flares observed in a given period bin does not show any clear
correlation with the rotation period. We also found that the duration of

objects in images (e.g. ""man riding bicycle"" and ""man pushing bicycle"").
Consequently, the set of possible relationships is extremely large and it is
difficult to obtain sufficient training examples for all possible

detection has concentrated on predicting only a handful of relationships.
Though most relationships are infrequent, their objects (e.g. ""man"" and
""bicycle"") and predicates (e.g. ""riding"" and ""pushing"") independently occur
more frequently. We propose a model that uses this insight to train visual
models for objects and predicates individually and later combines them together
to predict multiple relationships per image. We improve on prior work by
leveraging language priors from semantic word embeddings to finetune the
likelihood of a predicted relationship. Our model can scale to predict
thousands of types of relationships from a few examples. Additionally, we
localize the objects in the predicted relationships as bounding boxes in the

  bandwidth",,,,,"cs.IT cs.DS math.IT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  An $(n, M)$ vector code $\mathcal{C} \subseteq \mathbb{F}^n$ is a collection
of $M$ codewords where $n$ elements (from the field $\mathbb{F}$) in each of
the codewords are referred to as code blocks. Assuming that $\mathbb{F} \cong
\mathbb{B}^{\ell}$, the code blocks are treated as $\ell$-length vectors over
the base field $\mathbb{B}$. Equivalently, the code is said to have the
sub-packetization level $\ell$. This paper addresses the problem of
constructing MDS vector codes which enable exact reconstruction of each code
block by downloading small amount of information from the remaining code
blocks. The repair bandwidth of a code measures the information flow from the
remaining code blocks during the reconstruction of a single code block. This
problem naturally arises in the context of distributed storage systems as the
node repair problem [4]. Assuming that $M = |\mathbb{B}|^{k\ell}$, the repair
bandwidth of an MDS vector code is lower bounded by $\big(\frac{n - 1}{n -
k}\big)\cdot \ell$ symbols (over the base field $\mathbb{B}$) which is also
referred to as the cut-set bound [4]. For all values of $n$ and $k$, the MDS
vector codes that attain the cut-set bound with the sub-packetization level
$\ell = (n-k)^{\lceil{{n}/{(n-k)}}\rceil}$ are known in the literature [23,
35].
  This paper presents a construction for MDS vector codes which simultaneously
ensures both small repair bandwidth and small sub-packetization level. The
obtained codes have the smallest possible sub-packetization level $\ell = O(n -
k)$ for an MDS vector code and the repair bandwidth which is at most twice the
cut-set bound. The paper then generalizes this code construction so that the
repair bandwidth of the obtained codes approach the cut-set bound at the cost
of increased sub-packetization level. The constructions presented in this paper
give MDS vector codes which are linear over the base field $\mathbb{B}$.

Recently, powders of a metallic oxide (Sr$_{1-x}$NbO$_3$, 0.03 < x < 0.20) have
shown competitive photocatalytic efficiency, opening up the material space
available for finding optimizing performance in water-splitting applications.
The origin of the visible light absorption in these powders was reported to be
due to an interband transition and the charge carrier separation was proposed
to be due to the high carrier mobility of this material. In the current work we
have prepared epitaxial thin films of Sr$_{0.94}$NbO$_{3+{\delta}}$ and found
that the bandgap of this material is ~4.1 eV, which is very large. Surprisingly
the carrier density of the conducting phase reaches 10$^{22}$ cm$^{-3}$, which
is only one order smaller than that of elemental metals and the carrier
mobility is only 2.47 cm$^2$/(V$\cdot$s). Contrary to earlier reports, the
visible light absorption at 1.8 eV (~688 nm) is due to the bulk plasmon
resonance, arising from the large carrier density, instead of an interband
transition. Excitation of the plasmonic resonance results in a multifold
enhancement of the lifetime of charge carriers. Thus we propose that the hot
charge carriers generated from decay of plasmons produced by optical absorption
is responsible for the water splitting efficiency of this material under
visible light irradiation.

  Pictorial Structure",,,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In this paper, we present a data-driven approach for human pose tracking in
video data. We formulate the human pose tracking problem as a discrete
optimization problem based on spatio-temporal pictorial structure model and
solve this problem in a greedy framework very efficiently. We propose the model
to track the human pose by combining the human pose estimation from single
image and traditional object tracking in a video. Our pose tracking objective
function consists of the following terms: likeliness of appearance of a part
within a frame, temporal displacement of the part from previous frame to the
current frame, and the spatial dependency of a part with its parent in the
graph structure. Experimental evaluation on benchmark datasets (VideoPose2,
Poses in the Wild and Outdoor Pose) as well as on our newly build ICDPose
dataset shows the usefulness of our proposed method.

derived to characterize the achievable total DoF. Afterwards, we analytically
derive the optimal number of transmit and receive antennas at each node to
maximize the total DoF of the system, subject to the total number of antennas

constructed. The proposed schemes are mainly based on zero-forcing and

that a function on two nodes can be computed by examining their labels alone.
For the particular case of trees, optimal bounds (up to low order terms) were
recently obtained for adjacency labeling [FOCS'15], nearest common ancestor
labeling [SODA'14], and ancestry labeling [SICOMP'06]. In this paper we obtain
optimal bounds for distance labeling. We present labels of size
$1/4\log^2n+o(\log^2n)$, matching (up to low order terms) the recent
$1/4\log^2n-O(\log n)$ lower bound [ICALP'16].
  Prior to our work, all distance labeling schemes for trees could be
reinterpreted as universal trees. A tree $T$ is said to be universal if any
tree on $n$ nodes can be found as a subtree of $T$. A universal tree with $|T|$
nodes implies a distance labeling scheme with label size $\log |T|$. In 1981,
Chung et al. proved that any distance labeling scheme based on universal trees
requires labels of size $1/2\log^2 n-\log n\cdot\log\log n+O(\log n)$. Our
scheme is the first to break this lower bound, showing a separation between
distance labeling and universal trees.
  The $\Theta(\log^2 n)$ barrier has led researchers to consider distances
bounded by $k$. The size of such labels was improved from $\log n+O(k\sqrt{\log
n})$ [WADS'01] to $\log n+O(k^2(\log(k\log n))$ [SODA'03] and then to $\log
n+O(k\log(k\log(n/k)))$ [PODC'07]. We show how to construct labels whose size
is $\min\{\log n+O(k\log((\log n)/k)),O(\log n\cdot\log(k/\log n))\}$. We
complement this with almost tight lower bounds of $\log n+\Omega(k\log(\log
n/(k\log k)))$ and $\Omega(\log n\cdot\log(k/\log n))$. Finally, we consider
$(1+\varepsilon)$-approximate distances. We show that the labeling scheme of
[ICALP'16] can be easily modified to obtain an $O(\log(1/\varepsilon)\cdot\log
n)$ upper bound and we prove a $\Omega(\log(1/\varepsilon)\cdot\log n)$ lower
bound.

need to eventually agree on a counter that is increased by one modulo $C$ in

task is to eventually guarantee that all non-faulty nodes have simultaneous
responses to external inputs: if a subset of the correct nodes receive an

(in the not-too-distant future) in which to jointly output a ""fire"" signal.
Moreover, no node should generate a ""fire"" signal without some correct node
having previously received a ""go"" signal as input.
  We present a framework reducing both tasks to binary consensus at very small
cost. For example, we obtain a deterministic algorithm for self-stabilising
Byzantine firing squads with optimal resilience $f<n/3$, asymptotically optimal
stabilisation and response time $O(f)$, and message size $O(\log f)$. As our
framework does not restrict the type of consensus routines used, we also obtain
efficient randomised solutions, and it is straightforward to adapt our

one-dimensional analog, the non-linear Kac-Boltzmann equation, to prove results
for the Kac Walk. Here we investigate new functional inequalities for the Kac
Walk pertaining to entropy production, and introduce a new form of
`chaoticity'. We then show how these entropy production inequalities imply
entropy production inequalities for the Kac-Boltzmann equation. This results
validate Kac's program for proving results on the non-linear Boltzmann equation

the mixture structure, while simultaneously it avoids over/under fitting. The
pixel density estimate is followed by an efficient and highly accurate updating
mechanism, which permits our system to be automatically adapted to dynamically
changing operation conditions. We propose a reference implementation of our

this approach the whole star inflates and deflates along a period that can vary
from 100 to 900 days; that pulsation is assumed to produce shock waves on the
outer layers of the star that propagate into the atmosphere and could account
for the increase in luminosity and the presence of emission lines in the
spectra of these stars. However, this paradigm can seriously be questioned from
a theoretical point of view. First, in order to maintain a radial pulsation,
the spherical symmetry of the star must be preserved: how can it be reconciled
with the large convective cells present in these stars? or when close
companions are detected? Secondly, how different radial and non-radial
pulsation modes of a sphere could be all damped except one radial mode? These
problems have no solution and significantly weigh on the pulsation paradigm.
Acknowledging this inconsistency, we show that a close companion around these
stars could account for the star variability. To support this assertion we
study the observed light curves, their shapes at different wavelengths and
their changes over time.

complemented by archival quasi-simultaneous INTEGRAL observations. We found
that, to the first order, NGC 2617 looks like a type 1 AGN in the X-ray band
and, with the addition of a modest reflection component, its continuum can be
modelled well either with a power law plus a phenomenological blackbody, a
partially covered power law, or a double Comptonisation model. Independent of
the continuum adopted, in all three cases a column density of a few $10^{23}$
cm$^{-2}$ of neutral gas covering 20-40\% of the continuum source is required
by the data. Most interestingly, absorption structures due to highly ionised
iron have been detected in both observations with a redshift of about $0.1c$
with respect to the systemic redshift of the host galaxy. The redshifted
absorber can be ascribed to a failed wind/aborted jets component, to
gravitational redshift effects, and/or to matter directly falling towards the
central supermassive black hole. In either case, we are probing the innermost
accretion flow around the central supermassive black hole of NGC 2617 and might
be even watching matter in a direct inflow towards the black hole itself.
