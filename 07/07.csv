to the surface of topological insulators and Rashba system. Consequently, the

scenarios. Therefore, an accurate numerical simulation of these phenomena is
mandatory to correctly model and understand many astrophysical events, such as
Supernovas, stellar collisions, or planetary formation. In this work, we
attempt to address many of the problems that the smoothed particle
hydrodynamics (SPH) technique has when dealing with subsonic hydrodynamical
instabilities or shocks. To that aim we built a new SPH code named SPHYNX, that
includes many of the recent advances in the SPH technique and some other new
ones, which we present here. SPHYNX is of Newtonian type and grounded in the
Euler-Lagrange formulation of the SPH technique. Its distinctive features are:
the use of an integral approach to estimating the gradients; the use of a
flexible family of interpolators called sinc kernels, which suppress pairing
instability; and the incorporation of a new type of volume element which
provides a better partition of the unity. Unlike other modern formulations,
which consider volume elements linked to pressure, our volume element choice
relies on density. SPHYNX conserves mass, linear and angular momentum, energy,
entropy, and preserves kernel normalization even in strong shocks. The coupling
between the integral approach to calculate gradients and the new family of
volume elements reduces the so-called tensile instability. Both features help
to suppress the damp which often prevents the growth of hydrodynamic
instabilities in regular SPH codes. On the whole, SPHYNX has passed the
verification tests described below. For identical particle setting and initial
conditions the results were similar (or better in some particular cases) than
those obtained with other SPH schemes such as GADGET-2, PSPH or with the recent
density-independent formulation (DISPH) and conservative reproducing kernel
(CRKSPH) techniques.

underlying anatomy. Yet how the organization of white matter architecture
constrains how the brain transitions from one cognitive state to another
remains unknown. Here we address this question from a computational perspective
by defining a brain state as a pattern of activity across brain regions.
Drawing on recent advances in network control theory, we model the underlying
mechanisms of brain state transitions as elicited by the collective control of
region sets. Specifically, we examine how the brain moves from a specified
initial state (characterized by high activity in the default mode) to a
specified target state (characterized by high activity in primary sensorimotor
cortex) in finite time. Across all state transitions, we observe that the
supramarginal gyrus and the inferior parietal lobule consistently acted as
efficient, low energy control hubs, consistent with their strong anatomical
connections to key input areas of sensorimotor cortex. Importantly, both these
and other regions in the fronto-parietal, cingulo-opercular, and attention
systems are poised to affect a broad array of state transitions that cannot
easily be classified by traditional notions of control common in the
engineering literature. This theoretical versatility comes with a vulnerability
to injury. In patients with mild traumatic brain injury, we observe a loss of
specificity in putative control processes, suggesting greater susceptibility to
damage-induced noise in neurophysiological activity. These results offer
fundamentally new insights into the mechanisms driving brain state transitions
in healthy cognition and their alteration following injury.

of the most promising and viable numerical tools to study turbulent dispersed
flows when the computational cost of Direct Numerical Simulation (DNS) becomes
too expensive. The applicability of this approach is however limited if the
effects of the Sub-Grid Scales (SGS) of the flow on particle dynamics are
neglected. In this paper, we propose to take these effects into account by
means of a Lagrangian stochastic SGS model for the equations of particle
motion. The model extends to particle-laden flows the velocity-filtered density
function method originally developed for reactive flows. The underlying
filtered density function is simulated through a Lagrangian Monte Carlo
procedure that solves for a set of Stochastic Differential Equations (SDEs)
along individual particle trajectories. The resulting model is tested for the
reference case of turbulent channel flow, using a hybrid algorithm in which the
fluid velocity field is provided by LES and then used to advance the SDEs in
time. The model consistency is assessed in the limit of particles with zero
inertia, when ""duplicate fields"" are available from both the Eulerian LES and
the Lagrangian tracking. Tests with inertial particles were performed to
examine the capability of the model to capture particle preferential
concentration and near-wall segregation. Upon comparison with DNS-based
statistics, our results show improved accuracy and considerably reduced errors
with respect to the case in which no SGS model is used in the equations of
particle motion.

planning, which has been shown to work well for single-player games, to two (or
in principle many) player games. To select an action the algorithm co-evolves
two (or in the general case N) populations, one for each player, where each
individual is a sequence of actions for the respective player. The fitness of
each individual is evaluated by playing it against a selection of
action-sequences from the opposing population. When choosing an action to take
in the game, the first action is chosen from the fittest member of the
population for that player. The new algorithm is compared with a number of
general video game AI algorithms on three variations of a two-player space
battle game, with promising results.

numerical mathematics, and for a general, unstructured $n\times n$ matrix it
can be computed in $\mathcal{O}(n^3)$ operations. An interesting problem arises
if the input matrix is a Toeplitz matrix, for example as the result of
discretizing integral equations with a time invariant kernel. In this case it
is not obvious how to take advantage of the Toeplitz structure, as the
exponential of a Toeplitz matrix is, in general, not a Toeplitz matrix itself.
The main contribution of this work are fast algorithms for the computation of
the Toeplitz matrix exponential. The algorithms have provable quadratic
complexity if the spectrum is real, or sectorial, or more generally, if the
imaginary parts of the rightmost eigenvalues do not vary too much. They may be
efficient even outside these spectral constraints. They are based on the
scaling and squaring framework, and their analysis connects classical results
from rational approximation theory to matrices of low displacement rank. As an
example, the developed methods are applied to Merton's jump-diffusion model for
option pricing.

in weakly collisional plasmas, such as the solar wind. In addition to providing
a direct estimate of the local rate of energy transfer between fields and

and technological systems, but has been challenging to reproduce in silico.
Most theoretical efforts focus on key aspects of open-ended evolution as it
appears in biology. We recast the problem as a more general one in dynamical
systems theory, providing simple criteria for open-ended evolution based on two
hallmark features: unbounded evolution and innovation. We define unbounded
evolution as patterns that are non-repeating within the expected Poincare
recurrence time of an equivalent isolated system, and innovation as
trajectories not observed in isolated systems. As a case study, we implement
novel variants of cellular automata (CA) in which the update rules are allowed
to vary with time in three alternative ways. Each is capable of generating
conditions for open-ended evolution, but vary in their ability to do so. We
find that state-dependent dynamics, widely regarded as a hallmark of life,
statistically out-performs other candidate mechanisms, and is the only
mechanism to produce open-ended evolution in a scalable manner, essential to
the notion of ongoing evolution. This analysis suggests a new framework for
unifying mechanisms for generating OEE with features distinctive to life and
its artifacts, with broad applicability to biological and artificial systems.

Definite Advection Transport Algorithm (MPDATA) to numerical solutions of
partial differential equations arising from stochastic models in quantitative
finance. In particular, we develop a framework for solving Black-Scholes-type
equations by first transforming them into advection-diffusion problems, and
numerically integrating using an iterative explicit finite-difference approach,
in which the Fickian term is represented as an additional advective term. We
discuss the correspondence between transport phenomena and financial models,
uncovering the possibility of expressing the no-arbitrage principle as a
conservation law. We depict second-order accuracy in time and space of the
embraced numerical scheme. This is done in a convergence analysis comparing
MPDATA numerical solutions with classic Black-Scholes analytical formulae for
the valuation of European options. We demonstrate in addition a way of applying
MPDATA to solve the free boundary problem (leading to a linear complementarity
problem) for the valuation of American options. We finally comment on the
potential the MPDATA framework has with respect to being applied in tandem with
more complex models typically used in quantitive finance.

to non-relativistic dynamical charged matter (point particles and charged
complex scalars). The GED theory contains besides the electric and magnetic

torsional Newton-Cartan geometry while GED can be coupled to an arbitrary
torsional Newton-Cartan background. The global symmetries of the electric and
magnetic limit theories on flat space consist in any dimension of the infinite
dimensional Galilean conformal algebra and a $U(1)$ current algebra. For the
on-shell GED theory this symmetry is reduced but still infinite dimensional,
while off-shell only the Galilei algebra plus two dilatations remain. Hence one
can scale time and space independently, allowing Lifshitz scale symmetries for
any value of the critical exponent $z$.

  We compare 1,153 high school males who played varsity football to 2,751 male
students who did not. 1,951 of the control subjects did not play any sport and
the remaining 800 controls played a non-contact sport. We focus on two primary
outcomes measured at age 65: a composite cognitive outcome measuring verbal
fluency and memory and the modified CES-D depression score. To control for
potential confounders we adjust for pre-exposure covariates such as IQ with
matching and model-based covariate adjustment. We will conduct an ordered
testing procedure that uses all 2,751 controls while controlling for possible
unmeasured differences between students who played sports and those who did
not. We will quantitatively assess the sensitivity of the results to potential

community detection in the stochastic block model. Specifically, consider the
symmetric stochastic block model with $q$ groups, average degree $d$, and
connection probabilities $c_\text{in}/n$ and $c_\text{out}/n$ for within-group
and between-group edges respectively; let $\lambda =
(c_\text{in}-c_\text{out})/(qd)$. We show that, when $q$ is large, and $\lambda
= O(1/q)$, the critical value of $d$ at which community detection becomes
possible---in physical terms, the condensation threshold---is \[ d_\text{c} =
\Theta\!\left( \frac{\log q}{q \lambda^2} \right) \, , \] with tighter results
in certain regimes. Above this threshold, we show that any partition of the
nodes into $q$ groups which is as `good' as the planted one, in terms of the
number of within- and between-group edges, is correlated with it. This gives an
exponential-time algorithm that performs better than chance; specifically,
community detection becomes possible below the Kesten-Stigum bound for $q \ge
5$ in the disassortative case $\lambda < 0$, and for $q \ge 11$ in the
assortative case $\lambda >0$ (similar upper bounds were obtained independently
by Abbe and Sandon). Conversely, below this threshold, we show that no
algorithm can label the vertices better than chance, or even distinguish the
block model from an \ER\ random graph with high probability.
  Our lower bound on $d_\text{c}$ uses Robinson and Wormald's small subgraph
conditioning method, and we also give (less explicit) results for non-symmetric
stochastic block models. In the symmetric case, we obtain explicit results by
using bounds on certain functions of doubly stochastic matrices due to
Achlioptas and Naor; indeed, our lower bound on $d_\text{c}$ is their second
moment lower bound on the $q$-colorability threshold for random graphs with a
certain effective degree.

use the CosmoLike code to simulate a joint analysis of all the two-point
functions of galaxy density, galaxy shear and CMB lensing convergence. We
include the full Gaussian and non-Gaussian covariances and explore the
resulting joint likelihood with Monte Carlo Markov Chains. We constrain shear
calibration biases while simultaneously varying cosmological parameters, galaxy
biases and photometric redshift uncertainties. We find that CMB lensing from
CMB S4 enables the calibration of the shear biases down to 0.2% - 3% in 10
tomographic bins for LSST (below the ~0.5% requirements in most tomographic
bins), down to 0.4% - 2.4% in 10 bins for Euclid and 0.6% - 3.2% in 10 bins for
WFIRST. For a given lensing survey, the method works best at high redshift
where shear calibration is otherwise most challenging. This self-calibration is
robust to Gaussian photometric redshift uncertainties and to a reasonable level
of intrinsic alignment. It is also robust to changes in the beam and the
effectiveness of the component separation of the CMB experiment, and slowly
dependent on its depth, making it possible with third generation CMB
experiments such as AdvACT and SPT-3G, as well as the Simons Observatory.

two sharply-distinct behaviors: a ""strong"" quarteting phase in which charge-4e
quartets are tightly bound (like molecules) so that charge-2e pairing does not
occur even in the temperature $T \to 0$ limit, and a ""weak"" quarteting phase in
which a further transition to a charge-2e superconducting phase occurs at a
lower critical temperature. Analogous issues arise in a putative Z4 spin-liquid
with a pseudo-Fermi surface and in characterizing charge-2e SCs with ""odd
frequency pairing"" (or equivalently with a ""composite order parameter"") and
metallic spin-nematics. Under certain circumstances, we also identified a
stable T=0 charge-4e SC phase with gapless nodal quasiparticles. We further
discuss possible relevance of our results to various experimental observations
in 1/8-doped LBCO.

unabsorbed 0.5-8.0 keV luminosity of $10^{34}$ erg/s. In the inner bulge, where
exposure is approximately constant, X-ray fluxes represent average values

Similarly, our catalogue is more complete in the bulge fields since monitoring
allowed more transient sources to be detected. The catalogue was
cross-correlated with a previous XMM-Newton catalogue of M31's $D_{25}$
isophote consisting of 1948 X-ray sources, with only 979 within the field of
view of our survey. We found 387 (49%) of our Chandra sources (352 or 44%

this result with matching done to previous Chandra X-ray sources we detected
259 new sources in our catalogue. We created X-ray luminosity functions (XLFs)
in the soft (0.5-2.0 keV) and hard (2.0-8.0 keV) bands that are the most

Completeness-corrected XLFs show a break around $1.3\times10^{37}$ erg/s,
consistent with previous work. As in past surveys, we find the bulge XLFs are
flatter than the disk, indicating a lack of bright high-mass X-ray binaries in
the disk and an aging population of low-mass X-ray binaries in the bulge.

trans-Neptunian objects with moderate eccentricities, perihelia beyond 40 AU,
and semimajor axes beyond 50 AU. Like the few previously known objects on
similar orbits, these objects' semimajor axes are just beyond the Kuiper belt
edge and clustered around Neptunian mean motion resonances (MMRs). These
objects likely obtained their observed orbits while trapped within MMRs, when
the Kozai-Lidov mechanism raised their perihelia and weakened Neptune's
dynamical influence. Using numerical simulations that model the production of
this population, we find that high-perihelion objects near Neptunian MMRs can
constrain the nature and timescale of Neptune's past orbital migration. In
particular, the population near the 3:1 MMR (near 62 AU) is especially useful
due to its large population and short dynamical evolution timescale. If Neptune
finishes migrating within ~100 Myrs or less, we predict over 90% of
high-perihelion objects near the 3:1 MMR will have semimajor axes within 1 AU
of each other, very near the modern resonance's center. On the other hand, if
Neptune's migration takes ~300 Myrs, we expect ~50% of this population to
reside in dynamically fossilized orbits over ~1 AU closer to the Sun than the
modern resonance. We highlight 2015 KH162 as a likely member of this fossilized
3:1 population. Under any plausible migration scenario, nearly all
high-perihelion objects in resonances beyond the 4:1 MMR (near 76 AU) reach
their orbits well after Neptune stops migrating and comprise a recently
generated, dynamically active population.

star formation efficiency of the molecular gas at least 10 times higher than

higher efficiency. The molecular clouds within II Zw 40 resemble those in other

constrain the accretion geometry. We found that the accretion disk is viewed at
an inclination of i~27-35 degrees and extended close to the neutron star, down
to Rin~5-7.5 gravitational radii (~11-17 km). This inner disk radius suggests
that the neutron star magnetic field strength is B<2E8 G. We find a narrow
absorption line in the Chandra/HEG data at an energy of ~7.64 keV with a
significance of ~4.8 sigma. This feature could correspond to blue-shifted Fe
xxvi and arise from an accretion disk wind, which would imply an outflow
velocity of v~0.086c (~25800 km s-1). However, this would be extreme for an

assume a Gaussian functional form (chi-squared form) for the likelihood. This

Approximate Bayesian Computation (ABC) relax these restrictions and make
inference possible without making any assumptions on the likelihood. Instead
ABC relies on a forward generative model of the data and a metric for measuring
the distance between the model and data. In this work, we demonstrate that ABC
is feasible for LSS parameter inference by using it to constrain parameters of
the halo occupation distribution (HOD) model for populating dark matter halos
with galaxies.
  Using specific implementation of ABC supplemented with Population Monte Carlo
importance sampling, a generative forward model using HOD, and a distance
metric based on galaxy number density, two-point correlation function, and
galaxy group multiplicity function, we constrain the HOD parameters of mock
observation generated from selected ""true"" HOD parameters. The parameter
constraints we obtain from ABC are consistent with the ""true"" HOD parameters,
demonstrating that ABC can be reliably used for parameter inference in LSS.
Furthermore, we compare our ABC constraints to constraints we obtain using a
pseudo-likelihood function of Gaussian form with MCMC and find consistent HOD
parameter constraints. Ultimately our results suggest that ABC can and should
be applied in parameter inference for LSS analyses.

significantly detecting one. The VLA observations indicate baryonic gas
fractions >~5 times lower and gas depletion times >~10 times shorter than
normal, extended massive star-forming galaxies at these redshifts. At their
current star formation rates, all three objects will deplete their gas
reservoirs within 100Myr. These objects are among the most gas-poor objects
observed at z>2, and are outliers from standard gas scaling relations, a result
which remains true regardless of assumptions about the CO-H2 conversion factor.
Our observations are consistent with the idea that compact, star-forming
galaxies are in a rapid state of transition to quiescence in tandem with the
build-up of the z~2 quenched population. In the detected compact galaxy, we see
no evidence of rotation or that the CO-emitting gas is spatially extended

driven by supernova explosions and a cooler, denser cloud of interstellar or
circumgalactic media. By resolving scales of $\Delta x<0.1$ pc over $>100$ pc
distances our calculations capture how the cloud disruption leads to a
distribution of densities and temperatures in the resulting multiphase outflow,
and quantify the mass and momentum associated with each phase. We find the
multiphase wind contains comparable mass and momenta in phases over a wide
range of densities and temperatures extending from the hot wind ($n \approx
10^{-2.5}$ $\mathrm{cm}^{-3}$, $T \approx 10^{6.5}$ K) to the coldest
components ($n \approx 10^2$ $\mathrm{cm}^{-3}$, $T \approx 10^2$ K). We
further find that the momentum distributes roughly in proportion to the mass in
each phase, and the mass-loading of the hot phase by the destruction of cold,
dense material is an efficient process. These results provide new insight into
the physical origin of observed multiphase galactic outflows, and inform galaxy
formation models that include coarser treatments of galactic winds. Our results
confirm that cool gas observed in outflows at large distances from the galaxy

parameters based on the joint analysis of three multiply-imaged quasar systems
with measured gravitational time delays. First, we measure the time delay of
HE0435-1223 from 13-year light curves obtained as part of the COSMOGRAIL
project. Companion papers detail the modeling of the main deflectors and line
of sight effects, and how these data are combined to determine the time-delay
distance of HE 0435-1223. Crucially, the measurements are carried out blindly
with respect to cosmological parameters in order to avoid confirmation bias. We
then combine the time-delay distance of HE0435-1223 with previous measurements
from systems B1608+656 and RXJ1131-1231 to create a Time Delay Strong Lensing
probe (TDSL). In flat $\Lambda$CDM with free matter and energy density, we find
$H_0$ = 71.9 +2.4 -3.0 km/s/Mpc and $\Omega_{\Lambda}$ = 0.62 +0.24 -0.35 .
This measurement is completely independent of, and in agreement with, the local
distance ladder measurements of H0. We explore more general cosmological models
combining TDSL with other probes, illustrating its power to break degeneracies
inherent to other methods. The TDSL and Planck joint constraints are $H_0$ =
69.2 +1.4 -2.2 km/s/Mpc, $\Omega_{\Lambda}$ = 0.70 +0.01 -0.01 and $\Omega_k$ =
0.003 +0.004 -0.006 in open $\Lambda$CDM and $H_0$ = 79.0 +4.4 -4.2 km/s/Mpc,
$\Omega_{de}$ = 0.77 +0.02 -0.03 and $w$ = -1.38 +0.14 -0.16 in flat $w$CDM.
Combined with Planck and Baryon Acoustic Oscillation data, when relaxing the
constraints on the numbers of relativistic species we find $N_{eff}$ = 3.34
+0.21 -0.21 and when relaxing the total mass of neutrinos we find 0.182 eV. In
an open $w$CDM in combination with Planck and CMB lensing we find $H_0$ = 77.9

systems. We consider BNSs producing a hypermassive neutron star (HMNS) that
collapses to a spinning black hole (BH) surrounded by a magnetized accretion
disk in a few tens of ms. We investigate whether such systems may launch
relativistic jets and power short gamma-ray bursts. We study the effects of
different equations of state (EOSs), different mass ratios, and different
magnetic field orientations. For all cases, we present a detailed investigation
of the matter dynamics and of the magnetic field evolution, with particular
attention to its global structure and possible emission of relativistic jets.
The main result of this work is that we found the formation of an organized
magnetic field structure. This happens independently of EOS, mass ratio, and
initial magnetic field orientation. We also show that those models that produce
a longer-lived HMNS lead to a stronger magnetic field before collapse to BH.
Such larger fields make it possible, for at least one of our models, to resolve
the MRI and hence further amplify the magnetic field. However, by the end of
our simulations, we do not observe a magnetically dominated funnel and hence
neither a relativistic outflow. With respect to the recent simulations of Ruiz
et al 2016, we evolve models with lower and more realistic initial magnetic
field strengths and, because of computational reasons, we do not evolve the
accretion disk for the long timescales that seem to be required in order to see
a relativistic outflow. Since all our models produce a similar ordered magnetic
field structure, we expect that the results found in Ruiz et al 2016, where
they only considered an equal-mass system with an ideal fluid EOS, should be
general and, at least from a qualitative point of view, independent from
mass-ratio, magnetic field orientation, and EOS.

simulations which show that spiral density waves propagating in circumstellar
disks are unstable to the growth of a parametric instability that leads to
break-down of the flow into turbulence. This spiral wave instability (SWI)
arises from a resonant interaction between pairs of inertial waves, or
inertial-gravity waves, and the background spiral wave. The development of the
instability in the linear regime involves the growth of a broad spectrum of
inertial modes, with growth rates on the order of the orbital time, and results
in a nonlinear saturated state in which turbulent velocity perturbations are of
a similar magnitude to those induced by the spiral wave. The turbulence induces
angular momentum transport, and vertical mixing, at a rate that depends locally
on the amplitude of the spiral wave (we obtain a stress parameter $\alpha \sim
5 \times 10^{-4}$ in our reference model). The instability is found to operate
in a wide-range of disk models, including those with isothermal or adiabatic
equations of state, and in viscous disks where the dimensionless kinematic
viscosity $\nu\le 10^{-5}$. This robustness suggests that the instability will
have applications to a broad range of astrophysical disk-related phenomena,
including those in close binary systems, planets embedded in protoplanetary
disks (including Jupiter in our own Solar System) and FU Orionis outburst
models. Further work is required to determine the nature of the instability,
and to evaluate its observational consequences, in physically more complete
disk models than we have considered in this paper.

\LIGO/\VIRGO localization region is much larger (several hundreds of square
degrees) than the field of view of X-ray, optical and radio telescopes. The
Fermi Large Area Telescope (LAT) has a wide field of view ($\sim 2.4$ sr), and
detects $\sim 2-3$ sGRBs per year above 100 MeV. It can detect them not only
during the short prompt phase, but also during their long-lasting high-energy
afterglow phase. If other wide-field high-energy instruments such as Fermi-GBM,
Swift-BAT or INTEGRAL-ISGRI cannot detect or localize with enough precision an
EM counterpart during the prompt phase, the LAT can potentially pinpoint it
with $\lesssim 10$ arcmin accuracy during the afterglow phase. This routinely
happens with gamma-ray bursts. Moreover, the LAT will cover the entire
localization region within hours of any triggers during normal operations,
allowing the $\gamma$-ray flux of any EM counterpart to be measured or

not only is security based entirely on the laws of quantum mechanics, but it
holds irrespective of any a priori assumptions on the quantum devices used in a
protocol, making it particularly applicable in a quantum-wary environment.
While the existence of device-independent protocols for tasks such as
randomness expansion and quantum key distribution has recently been
established, the underlying proofs of security remain very challenging, yield
rather poor key rates, and demand very high-quality quantum devices, thus
making them all but impossible to implement in practice.
  We introduce a technique for the analysis of device-independent cryptographic
protocols. We provide a flexible protocol and give a security proof that
provides quantitative bounds that are asymptotically tight, even in the
presence of general quantum adversaries. At a high level our approach amounts
to establishing a reduction to the scenario in which the untrusted device
operates in an identical and independent way in each round of the protocol.
This is achieved by leveraging the sequential nature of the protocol, and makes
use of a newly developed tool, the ""entropy accumulation theorem"" of Dupuis et
al.
  As concrete applications we give simple and modular security proofs for
device-independent quantum key distribution and randomness expansion protocols
based on the CHSH inequality. For both tasks we establish essentially optimal
asymptotic key rates and noise tolerance. In view of recent experimental
progress, which has culminated in loophole-free Bell tests, it is likely that
these protocols can be practically implemented in the near future.

the large Yukawa couplings guarantees the stability of the DM candidate,
identified as the lightest of the RH neutrinos. The spontaneous breaking of
this symmetry, caused by a Majoron-like field, also provides a mechanism to
produce the observed relic density via the decays of the latter. The
phenomenological implications of the model are discussed, finding that large
LFV rates, observable in the near-future $\mu \to e$ conversion experiments,
require the DM mass to be in the keV range. Moreover, the active-neutrino

presence of a ""characteristic acceleration scale,"" and the correlation of its
residuals with other galaxy properties. We construct an empirical framework for
the galaxy-halo connection in LCDM to generate predictions for these
statistics, starting with conventional correlations (halo abundance matching;
AM) and introducing more where required. Comparing to the SPARC data, we find
that: 1) the approximate shape of the MDAR is readily reproduced by AM, and
there is no evidence that the acceleration at which dark matter becomes
negligible has less spread in the data than in AM mocks; 2) even under
conservative assumptions, AM significantly overpredicts the scatter in the
relation and its normalisation at low acceleration, and furthermore positions
dark matter too close to galaxies' centres on average; 3) the MDAR affords 2
sigma evidence for an anticorrelation of galaxy size and Hubble type with halo
mass or concentration at fixed stellar mass. Our analysis lays the groundwork

the perturbative dynamics in models with interaction in their dark sector. By
mean of a general study of gauge-invariant variables in comoving gauge, we
relate the sources of instabilities in the structure formation process with the
phantom crossing. In order to illustrate these relations and its consequences
in more detail, we consider a specific case of an holographic dark energy
interacting with dark matter. We find that in spite of the model is in
excellent agreement with observational data at background level, however it is
plagued of instabilities in its perturbative dynamics. We reconstruct the model
in order to avoid these undesirable instabilities, and we show that this
implies a modification of the concordance model at background. Also we find
drastic changes on the parameters space in our model when instabilities are
avoided.

in high energy physics to describe massless relativistic particles. One such
quintessentially field-theoretic idea of chiral anomaly already resulted in the
prediction and subsequent observation of the pronounced negative
magnetoresistance in these novel materials for parallel electric and magnetic
fields. Here we predict that the chiral anomaly occurs - and has experimentally
observable consequences - when real electromagnetic fields E and B are replaced
by strain-induced pseudo-electromagnetic fields e and b. For example, a uniform
pseudomagnetic field b is generated when a Weyl semimetal nanowire is put under

contribution to the wire resistance proportional to the square of the torsion
strength. Remarkably, left and right moving chiral modes are then spatially
segregated to the bulk and surface of the wire forming a ""topological coaxial
cable"". This produces hydrodynamic flow with potentially very long relaxation
time. Another effect we predict is the ultrasonic attenuation and
electromagnetic emission due to a time periodic mechanical deformation causing
pseudoelectric field e. These novel manifestations of the chiral anomaly are
most striking in the semimetals with a single pair of Weyl nodes but also occur
in Dirac semimetals such as Cd3As2 and Na3Bi and Weyl semimetals with unbroken

wavespeed structure based on adjoint tomography. Differences between seismic
observations and model predictions at individual stations may arise from
factors other than structural heterogeneity, such as errors in the assumed
source-time function, inaccurate timings, and systematic uncertainties. To
alleviate the corresponding nonuniqueness in the inverse problem, we construct
differential measurements between stations, thereby reducing the influence of
the source signature and systematic errors. We minimize the discrepancy between
observations and simulations in terms of the differential measurements made on
station pairs. We show how to implement the double-difference concept in
adjoint tomography, both theoretically and in practice. We compare the
sensitivities of absolute and differential measurements. The former provide
absolute information on structure along the ray paths between stations and
sources, whereas the latter explain relative (and thus higher-resolution)
structural variations in areas close to the stations. Whereas in conventional
tomography a measurement made on a single earthquake-station pair provides very
limited structural information, in double-difference tomography one earthquake
can actually resolve significant details of the structure. The
double-difference methodology can be incorporated into the usual adjoint
tomography workflow by simply pairing up all conventional measurements; the
computational cost of the necessary adjoint simulations is largely unaffected.
Rather than adding to the computational burden, the inversion of
double-difference measurements merely modifies the construction of the adjoint
sources for data assimilation.

indicate that this ratio, after a decline between $0.5-8$ GeV, rises steadily

the trend) appear to be in conflict with the diffusive shock acceleration (DSA)
mechanism, operating in a \emph{single} supernova remnant (SNR) shock. We argue
that $e^{+}/e^{-}$ ratio can still be explained by the DSA if positrons are
accelerated in a \emph{subset} of SNR shocks which: (i) propagate in clumpy gas
media, and (ii) are modified by accelerated CR \emph{protons}. The protons
penetrate into the dense gas clumps upstream to produce positrons and,
\emph{charge the clumps positively}. The induced electric field expels
positrons into the upstream plasma where they are shock-accelerated. Since the
shock is modified, these positrons develop a harder spectrum than that of the
CR electrons accelerated in other SNRs. Mixing these populations explains the
increase in the $e^{+}/e^{-}$ ratio at $E>8$ GeV. It decreases at $E<8$ GeV
because of a subshock weakening which also results from the shock modification.
Contrary to the expelled positrons, most of the antiprotons, electrons, and
heavier nuclei, are left unaccelerated inside the clumps. Scenarios for the
100-300 GeV AMS-02 fraction exceeding the model prediction, including, but not

that is based upon large sets of ultraviolet observations from the
International Ultraviolet Explorer and ground-based H-alpha observations. We
measured radial velocities for the Be star component from these spectra, and
computed a revised orbit. In order to search for the spectral signature of the
hot subdwarf, we cross-correlated the short wavelength end of each IUE spectrum
with a model hot star spectrum, and then we used the predicted Doppler shifts
of the subdwarf to shift-and-add all the cross-correlation functions to the
frame of the subdwarf. This merged function shows the weak signal from the
spectral lines of the hot star, and a best fit is obtained with a mass ratio
M_2/M_1 = 0.07 +/- 0.02, companion temperature T_{eff} > 43 +/- 5 kK, projected
rotational velocity V sin i < 30 km/s, and a monochromatic flux ratio near 1170
Angstroms of f_2/f_1 > 0.009 +/- 0.001. This hot subdwarf creates a one-armed
spiral, tidal wake in the disk of the Be star, and we present a circumbinary
disk model that can explain the occurrence of shell absorption lines by gas
enhancements that occur where gas crossing the gap created by the subdwarf
strikes the disk boundaries. The faint companion of HR 2142 may be
representative of a significant fraction of Be stars with undetected former
mass donor companion stars.

of program transformation and the area of program verification can fruitfully
exchange ideas and gain a deeper understanding of the interactions between
those two fields. The research papers which have been recently published in
those fields, show that the interactions are very beneficial and, indeed, go
both ways. In one direction, methods and tools developed in the field of
program transformation, such as partial deduction, partial evaluation,
fold/unfold transformations, and supercompilation, have all been applied with
success for the verification of systems, and in particular, the verification of
infinite state and parameterized systems. In the other direction, methods
developed in program verification, such as model checking, abstract
interpretation, SAT and SMT solving, and automated theorem proving, have been
used to enhance program transformation techniques, thereby making these
techniques more powerful and useful in practice.

gravity can predict an almost identical expansion history to standard

cosmological structures. Measurements of the cosmic bulk flow provides a method
for determining the strength of gravity over the history of structure
formation. We use the modified gravity N-body code ECOSMOG to simulate dark
matter particles and make predictions for the bulk flow magnitude in both
$\Lambda$CDM and $f(R)$ gravity. With the peculiar velocities output by ECOSMOG
we determine the bulk flow at depths ranging from $20h^{-1}$Mpc to
$50h^{-1}$Mpc, following the redshift and sky distribution of the 2MASS
Tully-Fisher survey (2MTF). At each depth, we find that the $\Lambda$CDM and
$f_{R0} = 10^{-5}$ simulations produce bulk flow measurements that are
consistent with $\Lambda$CDM predictions and the 2MTF survey at a $1\sigma$
level. We also find that adopting an $f(R)$ strength of $f_{R0} = 10^{-3}$
predict a much larger value for the bulk flow, which disagree with $\Lambda$CDM
predictions at all depths considered. We conclude that $f_{R0}$ must be
constrained to a level no greater than $10^{-4}$ to agree with bulk flow
measurements.

algorithms under a generalized coordinate-descent scheme. In this setting, the
adaptation step by each agent is limited to a random subset of the coordinates
of its stochastic gradient vector. The selection of coordinates varies randomly
from iteration to iteration and from agent to agent across the network. Such
schemes are useful in reducing computational complexity at each iteration in
power-intensive large data applications. They are also useful in modeling
situations where some partial gradient information may be missing at random.
Interestingly, the results show that the steady-state performance of the
learning strategy is not always degraded, while the convergence rate suffers
some degradation. The results provide yet another indication of the resilience

from information theory. We find that the amount of extracted information
depends on physiological constraints such as the sampling rate and memory
capacity of the downstream network, and is affected differentially by intrinsic

surprisingly, that the information is often insensitive to the detailed
structure of the underlying dynamics, and instead the decoding mechanism acts
as a simple low-pass filter. These results demonstrate the mechanisms and
limitations of dynamic information storage in cells.

measurements, the converted $u$-band magnitude becomes more accurate comparing
with the original SDSS $u$-band magnitude, in particular at the faint end. The
average $u$ (both SDSS and SCUSS) magnitude error of numerous main-sequence
stars with $0.2<g-r<0.8$ increase as $g$-band magnitude becomes fainter. When
$g=19.5$, the average magnitude error of SDSS $u$ is 0.11. When $g=20.5$, the

tags and descriptions, is the key form of contemporary city life. It tells
people where activities and locations that interest them are and it allows them
to share their urban experiences and self-representations. Therefore, any
analysis of urban structures and cultures needs to consider social media
activity. In our paper, we introduce the novel concept of social media
inequality. This concept allows us to quantitatively compare patterns in social
media activities between parts of a city, a number of cities, or any other
spatial areas. We define this concept using an analogy with the concept of
economic inequality. Economic inequality indicates how some economic
characteristics or material resources, such as income, wealth or consumption
are distributed in a city, country or between countries. Accordingly, we can
define social media inequality as the measure of the distribution of
characteristics from social media content shared in a particular geographic
area or between areas. An example of such characteristics is the number of
photos shared by all users of a social network such as Instagram in a given
city or city area, or the content of these photos. We propose that the standard
inequality measures used in other disciplines, such as the Gini coefficient,
can also be used to characterize social media inequality. To test our ideas, we
use a dataset of 7,442,454 public geo-coded Instagram images shared in
Manhattan during five months (March-July) in 2014, and also selected data for
287 Census tracts in Manhattan. We compare patterns in Instagram sharing for
locals and for visitors for all tracts, and also for hours in a 24-hour cycle.
We also look at relations between social media inequality and socio-economic
inequality using selected indicators for Census tracts.

out that it is difficult to detect the oscillation in the spectrum due to
suppression of the sub-Planckian decay constant of axion. On the other hand, in
the case of aligned chromo-natural inflation where the axion is coupled to a
SU(2) gauge field, it turns out that the sizable oscillation in the tensor

the robust controller gains are computed as solutions of a distributed convex

Because of the quantum Zeno effect due to the reactive nature of molecules the
system can be treated as hard-core. By tuning the ratio between the
nearest-neighbor interaction and hopping, various phases can be accessed by
controlling the polarization angle. In the ultra-strong coupling limit, the
system simplifies to a frustrated extended axial Ising model. For the small

archetypical system (liquid $^4$He) studied with DINS, which are then
numerically deconvoluted using its previously determined intrinsic scattering
function to yield $R_{obs}({Q},E)$. The second approach uses accurate Monte
Carlo simulations of the ARCS spectrometer, which account for all instrument
contributions, coupled to a representative scattering kernel to reproduce the
experimentally observed response $S({Q},E)$. Using a delta function as
scattering kernel, the simulation yields a resolution function $R_{sim}({Q},E)$
with comparable lineshape and features as $R_{obs}({Q},E)$, but somewhat
narrower due to the ideal nature of the model. Using each of these two
$R_{i}({Q},E)$ separately, we extract characteristic parameters of liquid
$^4$He such as the intrinsic linewidth $\alpha_2$ (which sets the atomic
kinetic energy $\langle K\rangle\sim\alpha_2$) in the normal liquid and the
Bose-Einstein condensate parameter $n_0$ in the superfluid phase. The extracted
$\alpha_2$ values agree well with previous measurements, independently of which

This popular advertising model brings a unique possibility for advertisers to
target users' immediate intent communicated through a search query, usually by
displaying their ads alongside organic search results for queries deemed
relevant to their products or services. However, due to a large number of
unique queries it is challenging for advertisers to identify all such relevant
queries. For this reason search engines often provide a service of advanced
matching, which automatically finds additional relevant queries for advertisers
to bid on. We present a novel advanced matching approach based on the idea of
semantic embeddings of queries and ads. The embeddings were learned using a
large data set of user search sessions, consisting of search queries, clicked
ads and search links, while utilizing contextual information such as dwell time
and skipped ads. To address the large-scale nature of our problem, both in
terms of data and vocabulary size, we propose a novel distributed algorithm for
training of the embeddings. Finally, we present an approach for overcoming a
cold-start problem associated with new ads and queries. We report results of
editorial evaluation and online tests on actual search traffic. The results
show that our approach significantly outperforms baselines in terms of
relevance, coverage, and incremental revenue. Lastly, we open-source learned
query embeddings to be used by researchers in computational advertising and
related fields.

differences in the signal propagation characteristics over the mmW and $\mu$W

proposed that considers both the blockage probability and the achievable rate

formulated as a one-to-many matching problem with minimum quota constraints for
the BSs that provides an efficient way to balance the load over the mmW and

proposed that is guaranteed to yield a Pareto optimal and two-sided stable

approximation of the posterior covariance of the QoI as a low-rank negative
update of its prior covariance, and prove optimality of this update with
respect to the natural geodesic distance on the manifold of symmetric positive
definite matrices. Assuming exact knowledge of the posterior mean of the QoI,
the optimality results extend to optimality in distribution with respect to the
Kullback-Leibler divergence and the Hellinger distance between the associated
distributions. We also propose approximation of the posterior mean of the QoI
as a low-rank linear function of the data, and prove optimality of this
approximation with respect to a weighted Bayes risk. Both of these optimal
approximations avoid the explicit computation of the full posterior
distribution of the parameters and instead focus on directions that are well
informed by the data and relevant to the QoI. These directions stem from a
balance among all the components of the goal-oriented inverse problem: prior
information, forward model, measurement noise, and ultimate goals. We
illustrate the theory using a high-dimensional inverse problem in heat

In this article we analyse a closure scheme for the acceleration fluctuations

Lagrangian correlation functions of fluid tracers. We compute the variance and
the flatness of inertial particle accelerations and we discuss their dependency
on the Stokes number. The closure incorporates effects induced by the
Lagrangian correlations along the trajectories of fluid tracers, and its
predictions agree well with results of direct numerical simulations of inertial
particles in turbulence, provided that the effects induced by the inertial
preferential sampling of heavy/light particles outside/inside vortices are
negligible. In particular, the scheme predicts the correct functional behaviour
of the acceleration variance, as a function of Stokes, as well as the presence
of a minimum/maximum for the flatness of the acceleration of heavy/light
particles, in good qualitative agreement with numerical data. We also show that
the closure works well when applied to the Lagrangian evolution of particles
using a stochastic surrogate for the underlying Eulerian velocity field. Our
results support the conclusion that there exist important contributions to the
statistics of the acceleration of inertial particles independent of the
preferential sampling. For heavy particles we observe deviations between the
predictions of the closure scheme and direct numerical simulations, at Stokes
numbers of order unity. For light particles the deviation occurs for larger
Stokes numbers.

energy scales in the Kondo impurity problem as a function of the exchange
coupling constant $J$ and the conduction electron density. We discuss the
relation between the impurity binding energy $\Delta E$ and the Kondo
temperature $T_K$. We find that the two are proportional only for large values
of $J$, whereas in the weak-coupling limit the energy gain is quadratic in $J$,
while the Kondo temperature is exponentially small. The exact relation between
the two quantities depends on the detailed form of the density of states of the
band. In the limit of low electron density the Kondo screening is affected by
the strong particle-hole asymmetry due to the presence of the band-edge van
Hove singularities. We consider the cases of 1D, 2D, and 3D tight-binding
lattices with inverse-square-root, step function, and square-root onsets of the
density of states that are characteristic of the respective dimensionalities.
We always find two different regimes depending on whether $T_K$ is higher or
lower than $\mu$, the chemical potential measured from the bottom of the band.
For 2D and 3D, we find a sigmoidal cross-over between the large-$J$ and
small-$J$ asymptotics in $\Delta E$, and a clear separation between $\Delta E$
and $T_K$ for $T_K < \mu$. For 1D, there is in addition a sizable
intermediate-$J$ regime where the Kondo temperature is quadratic in $J$ due to
the diverging density of states at the band edge. Furthermore, we find that in
1D the particle-hole asymmetry leads to a large decrease of $T_K$ compared to
the standard result obtained by approximating the density of states to be
constant (flat-band approximation), while in 3D the opposite is the case; this
is due to the non-trivial interplay of the exchange and potential scattering
renormalization in the presence of particle-hole asymmetry.

so in an adaptive setting without assuming knowledge of the sparsity level

a prior on the unknown sparsity level and the empirical Bayes method with the

optimal size if the sparsity level of the prior is set correctly. By general
theory honest confidence sets cannot adapt in size to an unknown sparsity

the horseshoe prior are not honest over the full parameter space. We show that
this is due to over-shrinkage for certain parameters and characterise the set

robotic network, installed at the Kourovka astronomical observatory of the Ural

installed at the private Acton Sky Portal Observatory (USA). As test
observations, we observed three celestial fields of size $2\times2$ deg$^2$
during the period from 2012 to 2015. As a result, we discovered four transiting
exoplanet candidates among the 39000 stars of the input catalogue. In this
paper, we provide the description of the project and analyse additional
photometric, spectral, and speckle interferometric observations of the
discovered transiting exoplanet candidates. Three of the four transiting
exoplanet candidates are most likely astrophysical false positives, while the

  JPEG Images",,,"10.1109/TIP.2016.2627807",,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Given the prevalence of JPEG compressed images, optimizing image
reconstruction from the compressed format remains an important problem. Instead
of simply reconstructing a pixel block from the centers of indexed DCT
coefficient quantization bins (hard decoding), soft decoding reconstructs a
block by selecting appropriate coefficient values within the indexed bins with
the help of signal priors. The challenge thus lies in how to define suitable
priors and apply them effectively.
  In this paper, we combine three image priors---Laplacian prior for DCT
coefficients, sparsity prior and graph-signal smoothness prior for image
patches---to construct an efficient JPEG soft decoding algorithm. Specifically,
we first use the Laplacian prior to compute a minimum mean square error (MMSE)
initial solution for each code block. Next, we show that while the sparsity
prior can reduce block artifacts, limiting the size of the over-complete
dictionary (to lower computation) would lead to poor recovery of high DCT
frequencies. To alleviate this problem, we design a new graph-signal smoothness
prior (desired signal has mainly low graph frequencies) based on the left
eigenvectors of the random walk graph Laplacian matrix (LERaG). Compared to
previous graph-signal smoothness priors, LERaG has desirable image filtering
properties with low computation overhead. We demonstrate how LERaG can
facilitate recovery of high DCT frequencies of a piecewise smooth (PWS) signal
via an interpretation of low graph frequency components as relaxed solutions to
normalized cut in spectral clustering. Finally, we construct a soft decoding
algorithm using the three signal priors with appropriate prior weights.
Experimental results show that our proposal outperforms state-of-the-art soft
decoding algorithms in both objective and subjective evaluations noticeably.

Recently, in spintronics, a spin counterpart of the Peltier effect was
observed. The ""spin Peltier effect"" modulates the temperature of a magnetic
junction depending on the direction of a spin current. Here we report thermal
imaging of the spin Peltier effect; using active thermography technique, we

the temperature change confined only in the vicinity of the metal/insulator

multiplet (having triply, doubly and singly charged scalars) at the electroweak
(EW) scale to explain the observed neutrino masses via the effective dimension
$7$ operator. The model also include a singlet scalar which is the di-photon
resonance. The loop induced coupling of the singlet scalar with a pair of
photons is enhanced due to contributions from multi-charged EW-scale scalars
(component of isospin $3/2$ multiplet) in the loop. We examine the production
of the singlet scalar at the LHC via photon-photon fusion sub-process and its
subsequent decay to di-photon. We found that a large part of parameter space of
the present model can explain the observed excess of di-photon events at the

predictions can be tested in the upcoming runs at the LHC.

moments of these quantities, such as the mean, standard deviation, or even
higher-order moments. Polynomial surrogate models based on polynomial chaos
expansions have often been implemented in this respect. The original approach
of uncertainty quantification using polynomial chaos is however intrusive. It
is based on a Galerkin-type formulation of the model equations to derive the
governing equations for the polynomial expansion coefficients. Third-order,
indeed fourth-order moments of the polynomials are needed in this analysis.
Besides, both intrusive and non-intrusive approaches call for their computation
provided that higher-order moments of the quantities of interest need be
post-processed. In most applications they are evaluated by Gauss quadratures,
and eventually stored for use throughout the computations. In this paper
analytical formulas are rather considered for the moments of the continuous

occurs through the migration of the adatom, the spontaneous formation of the
dimer structures of the two adatoms, the dimer-dimer structural transitions
that induce the exchange of the positions of the two adatoms, and then the
backward migration of the adatom. We also find that the dimer structure is
unfeasible at room temperature on the Si surface and the adatom interchange are
hereby unlikely. With the presence of the tip, we find that the reaction
pathways are essentially the same for the Ge surface but that the energy
barriers of the migration and the exchange processes are substantially reduced
by the AFM tip. We further find that the AFM tip induces the spontaneous
formation of the dimer structure even on the Si surface, hereby opening a
channel of the interchange of the adatoms. Our calculations show that the bond

previously developed microscopic model of flexible strings [1,2]. According to
this theory the energy per unit chain is considered as energy of flexible
string (Euler's elastic beam of finite thickness) and interaction between
chains is considered as an entropic repulsion. This microscopic theory allows
to obtain expression for lateral pressure distribution in bent lipid membrane
if treating a bending as a small deviation from the flat membrane conformation
and using perturbation theory with small parameter L0J, where L0 is the
monolayer thickness, J is mean curvature of membrane. Because lateral pressure
distribution is related to the elastic properties of lipid bilayer [3] then
first spontaneous moment of lateral pressure and the expression for bending
modulus may be derived from this theoretical model. Finally, based on
analytical expression for the lateral pressure distribution in bent lipid
membrane one can obtain analytically the energy difference between two states

terms of its global statistics (e.g. power spectra) and at small scales by the
properties of individual cores. Interest has been increasing in structures at
intermediate scales, resulting in a number of methods being developed for the
analysis of filamentary structures. We describe the application of the generic
template-matching (TM) method to the analysis of maps. Our aim is to show that
it provides a fast and still relatively robust way to identify elongated
structures or other image features. We present the implementation of a TM
algorithm for map analysis. The results are compared against rolling Hough
transform (RHT), one of the methods previously used to identify filamentary
structures. We illustrate the method by applying it to Herschel surface
brightness data. The performance of the TM method is found to be comparable to
that of RHT but TM appears to be more robust regarding the input parameters,
for example, those related to the selected spatial scales. Small modifications
of TM enable one to target structures at different size and intensity levels.
In addition to elongated features, we demonstrate the possibility of using TM
to also identify other types of structures. The TM method is a viable tool for
data quality control, exploratory data analysis, and even quantitative analysis
of structures in image data.

traverse the quark-gluon plasma produced in heavy-ion collisions, they become
de-correlated due to the vacuum soft gluon radiation associated with the

the first time, we employ the systematical resummation formalism and establish
a baseline calculation to describe the dihadron and hadron-jet angular

extracted from the angular de-correlations observed in $AA$ collisions. A
global $\chi^2$ analysis of dihadron and hadron-jet angular correlation data
renders the best fit $\langle p_\perp^2 \rangle \sim 13~\textrm{GeV}^2$ for a

structure impacts the complex functional dynamics of human thought. How does
large-scale brain circuitry constrain states of neuronal activity and
transitions between those states? We address these questions using a maximum
entropy model of brain dynamics informed by white matter tractography. We
demonstrate that the most probable brain states -- characterized by minimal
energy -- display common activation profiles across brain areas: local
spatially-contiguous sets of brain regions reminiscent of cognitive systems are
co-activated frequently. The predicted activation rate of these systems is
highly correlated with the observed activation rate measured in a separate
resting state fMRI data set, validating the utility of the maximum entropy
model in describing neurophysiologial dynamics. This approach also offers a
formal notion of the energy of activity within a system, and the energy of
activity shared between systems. We observe that within- and between-system
energies cleanly separate cognitive systems into distinct categories, optimized
for differential contributions to integrated v.s. segregated function. These
results support the notion that energetic and structural constraints
circumscribe brain dynamics, offering novel insights into the roles that
cognitive systems play in driving whole-brain activation patterns.

Si wafers with evaporated Cr and Cu underlayers. The alloy composition was
varied in the whole concentration range by varying the ratio of Ni sulfate and
Co sulfate in the electrolyte. The Ni Co alloy deposits were investigated first
in the as deposited state on the substrates and then, by mechanically stripping
them from the substrates, as self supporting layers both without and after
annealing. According to an X ray diffraction study, a strongly textured face
centered cubic (fcc) structure was formed in the as deposited state with an
average grain size of about 10 nm. Upon annealing, the crystal structure was
retained whereas the grain size increased by a factor of 3 to 5, depending on
alloy composition. The zero field resistivity decreased strongly by annealing
due to the increased grain size. The annealing hardly changed the AMR below 50
at.% Co but strongly decreased it above this concentration. The composition
dependence of the resistivity and the AMR of the annealed Ni Co alloy deposits
was in good quantitative agreement with the available literature data both at
13 K and at room temperature. Both transport parameters were found to exhibit a
pronounced maximum in the composition range between 20 and 30 at.% Co and the

the mass decomposition in the representative subsample of $57$ early-type

that the solution need not be an exclusive solution of conformal gravity but
can also be viewed as a solution of a class of $f(R)$ gravity theories coupled
to non-linear electrodynamics thereby rendering the ensuing results more
universal. Since lensing involves light bending, we shall first show that the
solution adds to Schwarzschild light bending caused by the luminous mass
($M_{\ast }$) a positive contribution $+\gamma R$ contrary to the previous
results in the literature, thereby resolving a long standing problem. The cause
of the error is critically examined. Applying the expressions for light bending
together with an input equating Einstein and Weyl angles, we develop a novel
algorithm for separating the luminous component from the total lens mass
(luminous+dark) within the Einstein radius. Our results indicate that the
luminous mass estimates differ from the observed total lens masses by a linear
proportionality factor. In quantitative detail, we observe that the ratios of
luminous over total lens mass ($f^{\ast }$) within the Einstein radius of
individual galaxies take on values near unity, many of which remarkably fall
inside or just marginally outside the specified error bars obtained from a
simulation based on the Bruzual-Charlot stellar population synthesis model
together with the Salpeter IMF favored on the ground of metallicity
[Grillo,2009]. We shall also calculate the average dark matter density of
individual galaxies within their respective Einstein spheres. The present
approach, being truly analytic, seems to be the first of its kind attempting to
provide a new decomposition scheme distinct from the simulational ones.

also find that this disc ""revival"" happens {\it more than thousands of years

the separation decreases, and a relativistic jet could be launched before the

found that the H$^{-}$ sublattice features in the low-pressure electronic
structure near the Fermi level of LiH are shifted to that dominated by the
Li$^{+}$ sublattice in compression. The lattice dynamics is studied in
quasi-harmonic approximation, from which the phonon contribution to the free
energy and the isotopic effects are accurately modelled with the aid of a
parameterized double-Debye model. The obtained equation of state (EOS) matches
perfectly with available static experimental data. The calculated principal
Hugoniot is also in accordance with that derived from shock wave experiments.
Using the calculated principal Hugoniot and the previous theoretical melting
curve, we predict a shock melting point at 56 GPa and 1923 K. In order to
establish the phase diagram for LiH, the phase boundaries between the B1 and B2
solid phases are explored. The B1-B2-liquid triple point is determined at about
241 GPa and 2413 K. The remarkable shift in the phase boundaries by isotopic
effect and temperature reveal the significant role played by lattice
vibrations. Furthermore, the Hugoniot of the static-dynamic coupling
compression is assessed. Our EOS suggests that a precompression of the sample
to 50 GPa will allow the shock Hugoniot passing through the triple point and
entering the B2 solid phase. This transition leads to a discontinuity with 4.6%
volume collapse, about four times greater than the same B1-B2 transition at
zero temperature.

giant molecular clouds (GMCs) in N-body simulations of growing disc galaxies.
The analysis resolves long-standing discrepancies between models and data by
demonstrating the importance of distinguishing between measured age-velocity
dispersion relations (AVRs) and the heating histories of the stars that make up
the AVR. We fit both AVRs and heating histories with formulae proportional to
t^beta and determine the exponents beta_R and beta_z derived from in-plane and
vertical AVRs and ~beta_R and ~beta_z from heating histories. Values of beta_z
are in almost all simulations larger than values of ~beta_z, whereas values of
beta_R are similar to or mildly larger than values of ~beta_R. Moreover, values
of beta_z (~beta_z) are generally larger than values of beta_R (~beta_R). The
dominant cause of these relations is the decline over the life of the disc in
importance of GMCs as heating agents relative to spiral structure and the bar.
We examine how age errors and biases in solar neighbourhood surveys influence
the measured AVR: they tend to decrease beta values by smearing out ages and
thus measured dispersions. We compare AVRs and velocity ellipsoid shapes
sigma_z/sigma_R from simulations to Solar neighbourhood data. We conclude that
for the expected disc mass and dark halo structure, combined GMC and spiral/bar
heating can explain the AVR of the Galactic thin disc. Strong departures of the
disc mass or the dark halo structure from expectation spoil fits to the data.

widely applied to color image super-resolution. Quite surprisingly, this
success has not been matched to depth super-resolution. This is mainly due to
the inherent difference between color and depth images. In this paper, we
bridge up the gap and extend the success of deep convolutional neural network
to depth super-resolution. The proposed deep depth super-resolution method
learns the mapping from a low-resolution depth image to a high resolution one
in an end-to-end style. Furthermore, to better regularize the learned depth
map, we propose to exploit the depth field statistics and the local correlation
between depth image and color image. These priors are integrated in an energy
minimization formulation, where the deep neural network learns the unary term,
the depth field statistics works as global model constraint and the color-depth
correlation is utilized to enforce the local structure in depth images.
Extensive experiments on various depth super-resolution benchmark datasets show
that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art depth image super-resolution

of a model for two-species phase segregation on an atomic lattice under the
presence of diffusion. The local model has been investigated in a series of
papers by P. Podio-Guidugli and the present authors; the nonlocal model studied
here consists of a highly nonlinear parabolic equation coupled to an ordinary
differential inclusion of subdifferential type. The inclusion originates from a
free energy containing the indicator function of the interval in which the
order parameter of the phase segregation attains its values. It also contains a
nonlocal term modeling long-range interactions. Due to the strong nonlinear
couplings between the state variables (which even involve products with time
derivatives), the analysis of the state system is difficult. In addition, the
presence of the differential inclusion is the reason that standard arguments of
optimal control theory cannot be applied to guarantee the existence of Lagrange
multipliers. In this paper, we employ recent results proved for smooth
logarithmic potentials and perform a so-called `deep quench' approximation to
establish existence and first-order necessary optimality conditions for the

quasi-one-dimensional conductor, an additional plateau-like feature appears at
a fraction of about 0.7 below the first conductance step in GaAs-based quantum
point contacts (QPCs). Despite a tremendous amount of research on this
anomalous feature, its origin remains still unclear. Here, a unique model of
this anomaly is proposed relied on fundamental principles of quantum mechanics.
It is noticed that just after opening a quasi-1D conducting channel in the QPC
a single electron travels the channel at a time, and such electron can be - in
principle - observed. The act of observation destroys superposition of spin
states, in which the electron otherwise exists, and this suppresses their
quantum interference. It is shown that the QPC-conductance is then reduded by a
factor of 0.74. ""Visibility"" of electron is enhanced if the electron spends
some time in the channel due to resonant transmission. Electron's resonance can
also explain an unusual temperature behaviour of the anomaly, as well as its
recently discovered feature: oscillatory modulation as a function of the
channel length and electrostatic potential. A recipe for experimental
verification of the model is given.

spectrum by allowing multiple parties to share resources. For instance, a
secondary unlicensed system can share resources with the cellular uplink of a
primary licensed system for an improved spectral efficiency. This induces
interference which has to be taken into account when designing such a system. A
simple yet robust strategy is treating interference as noise (TIN), which is
widely adapted in practice. It is thus important to study the capabilities and
limitations of TIN in such scenarios. In this paper, we study this scenario
modelled as Multiple Access Channel (MAC) interfered by a Point-to-Point (P2P)
channel. Here, we focus on rate maximization and power minimization problems
separately. We use improper Gaussian signaling (instead of proper) at the
transmitters to increase the design flexibility, which offers the freedom of
optimizing the transmit signal pseudo-variance in addition to its variance.
Furthermore, we allow correlation among the transmitted signals over orthogonal
resource basis (i.e., time or frequency) for the purpose of optimal signaling
design over the extended channel. We formulate the rate maximization problem as
a semidefinite program, and use semidefinite relaxation (SDR) to obtain a
near-optimal solution. Numerical optimizations show that, by improper Gaussian
signaling the achievable rates can be improved upto three times depending on
the strength of the interfering links. Furthermore, we observe significant
benefits in power consumption by improper Gaussian signaling with symbol
extensions compared to the traditional proper Gaussian signaling.
Interestingly, by minimizing sum power given the solution of the rate
maximization problem improves the energy efficiency significantly.

severely eroded original family of (153) Hilda. In the Trojan region we found
families with almost no Yarkovsky evolution, for which we could compute only
physically implausible ages. Hence, we interpreted their modest dispersions of
proper eccentricities and inclinations as implying that the Trojan asteroid
families are fossil families, frozen at their proper elements determined by the
original ejection velocity field. We have found a new family, among the Griquas
locked in the 2/1 resonance with Jupiter: (11097) 1994 UD1. We have estimated

autoregressive properties of the data. However all spatial methods, till now,
have assumed that the contiguity matrix is given apriori or can be estimated by
using a spatial similarity function. In this paper we propose a convex

model in which both the contiguity matrix and the non-spatial regression
parameters are unknown and inferred from the data. We solve the problem using
the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) which provides a

Viall & Klimchuk (2012) is becoming increasingly prevalent as an analysis
technique complementary to those traditionally used. The time lag method cross
correlates light curves at a given spatial location obtained in spectral bands
that sample different temperature plasmas. It has been used most extensively
with data from the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly on the Solar Dynamics
Observatory. We have previously applied the time lag method to entire active
regions and surrounding quiet Sun and create maps of the results (Viall &
Klimchuk 2012; Viall & Klimchuk 2015). We find that the majority of time lags
are consistent with the cooling of coronal plasma that has been impulsively
heated. Additionally, a significant fraction of the map area has a time lag of
zero. This does not indicate a lack of variability. Rather, strong variability
must be present, and it must occur in phase in the different channels. We have
shown previously that these zero time lags are consistent with the transition
region response to coronal nanoflares (Viall & Klimchuk 2015; Bradshaw & Viall
2016), but other explanations are possible. A common misconception is that the
zero time lag indicates steady emission resulting from steady heating. Using
simulated and observed light curves, we demonstrate here that highly correlated
light curves at zero time lag are not compatible with equilibrium solutions.

the signal and image processing communities, and several methods have been

convex relaxation, Basis Pursuit. In the first of this two-part work, we have
provided a theoretical back-bone for this model, providing guarantees for the
uniqueness of the sparsest solution and for the success of pursuit algorithms
by introducing the notion of stripe sparsity and other related measures.
Herein, we extend the analysis to a noisy regime, thereby considering signal
perturbations and model deviations. We address questions of stability of the
sparsest solutions and the success of pursuit algorithms, both greedy and
convex. Classical definitions such as the RIP are generalized to the
convolutional model, and existing notions such as the ERC are connected to our
setting. On the algorithmic side, we demonstrate how to solve the global
pursuit problem by using simple local processing, thus offering a first of its
kind bridge between global modeling of signals and their patch-based local
treatment.

found, evaluating the magnitude of the perturbations in the proper elements of

goods over a network and showed the existence of a class of Nash equilibria
called specialized equilibria wherein some agents exert maximum effort while
other agents free ride. We examine the efficiency, effort and cost of
specialized equilibria in comparison to other equilibria. Our main results show
that the welfare of a particular specialized equilibrium approaches the maximum
welfare amongst all equilibria as the concavity of the benefit function tends
to unity. For forest networks a similar result also holds as the concavity
approaches zero. Moreover, without any such concavity conditions, there exists
for any network a specialized equilibrium that requires the maximum weighted
effort amongst all equilibria. When the network is a forest, a specialized
equilibrium also incurs the minimum total cost amongst all equilibria. For
well-covered forest networks we show that all welfare maximizing equilibria are
specialized and all equilibria incur the same total cost. Thus we argue that
specialized equilibria may be considered as a refinement of the equilibrium of
the public goods game. We show several results on the structure and efficiency
of equilibria that highlight the role of dependants in the network.

A
significant challenge is the lack of training data, i.e., 2D images of humans
annotated with 3D poses. Such data is necessary to train state-of-the-art CNN
architectures. Here, we propose a solution to generate a large set of
photorealistic synthetic images of humans with 3D pose annotations. We
introduce an image-based synthesis engine that artificially augments a dataset
of real images with 2D human pose annotations using 3D Motion Capture (MoCap)
data. Given a candidate 3D pose our algorithm selects for each joint an image
whose 2D pose locally matches the projected 3D pose. The selected images are
then combined to generate a new synthetic image by stitching local image
patches in a kinematically constrained manner. The resulting images are used to
train an end-to-end CNN for full-body 3D pose estimation. We cluster the
training data into a large number of pose classes and tackle pose estimation as
a K-way classification problem. Such an approach is viable only with large
training sets such as ours. Our method outperforms the state of the art in
terms of 3D pose estimation in controlled environments (Human3.6M) and shows
promising results for in-the-wild images (LSP). This demonstrates that CNNs
trained on artificial images generalize well to real images.

peaked blazars. In spectral energy distribution, the first synchrotron hump of
the former class peaks in UV/X-rays and in IR/optical bands for the latter
class. The peak of the spectral energy distribution seems to be responsible for
variability properties of these classes of blazars in X-ray and optical bands.
Since, in low energy peaked blazars, the X-ray bands lies well below the
synchrotron hump, one expects that the highest energy electrons available for
the synchrotron emission would have slower effect of variability on X-ray
intra-day timescale. In this paper, by taking the advantage of a sample of 12
low energy peaked blazars with total 50 observations from XMM$-$Newton since
its launch, we confirm that this class is less variable in X-ray bands. We
found that out of 50 observational light curves, genuine intra-day variability
is present in only two of light curves i.e 4%. Similar results we obtained from
our earlier optical intra-day variability studies of high energy peaked blazars
where out of 144 light curves, only genuine intra-day variability was detected
in 6 light curves i.e ~ 4%. Since, X-ray bands lie below the peak of the
spectral energy distribution of LSPs where inverse Compton mechanism is
dominating rather than synchrotron radiation at the peak of the optical band,
leads to slower variability in the X-ray bands. Hence, reducing their intra-day
variability in X-ray bands as compared to the variability in optical bands.

sky. To exploit the statistical power of these surveys for weak lensing
measurements requires shape measurement methods with subpercent systematic
errors. We introduce a new weak lensing shear measurement algorithm, Shear
Nulling after PSF Gaussianisation (SNAPG), designed to avoid the noise biases
that affect most other methods. SNAPG operates on images that have been
convolved with a kernel that renders the Point Spread Function (PSF) a circular
Gaussian, and uses weighted second moments of the sources. The response of such
second moments to a shear of the pre-seeing galaxy image can be predicted
analytically, allowing us to construct a shear nulling scheme that finds the
shear parameters for which the observed galaxies are consistent with an
unsheared, isotropically oriented population of sources. The inverse of this
nulling shear is then an estimate of the gravitational lensing shear. We
identify the uncertainty of the estimated centre of each galaxy as the source
of noise bias, and incorporate an approximate estimate of the centroid
covariance into the scheme. We test the method on extensive suites of simulated
galaxies of increasing complexity, and find that it is capable of shear
measurements with multiplicative bias below 0.5 percent.

400-800MHz radio interferometer under development for deployment in South
Africa. HIRAX will comprise 1024 six meter parabolic dishes on a compact grid
and will map most of the southern sky over the course of four years. HIRAX has
two primary science goals: to constrain Dark Energy and measure structure at
high redshift, and to study radio transients and pulsars. HIRAX will observe
unresolved sources of neutral hydrogen via their redshifted 21-cm emission line
(`hydrogen intensity mapping'). The resulting maps of large-scale structure at
redshifts 0.8-2.5 will be used to measure Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAO).
HIRAX will improve upon current BAO measurements from galaxy surveys by
observing a larger cosmological volume (larger in both survey area and redshift
range) and by measuring BAO at higher redshift when the expansion of the
universe transitioned to Dark Energy domination. HIRAX will complement CHIME, a
hydrogen intensity mapping experiment in the Northern Hemisphere, by completing
the sky coverage in the same redshift range. HIRAX's location in the Southern
Hemisphere also allows a variety of cross-correlation measurements with
large-scale structure surveys at many wavelengths. Daily maps of a few thousand
square degrees of the Southern Hemisphere, encompassing much of the Milky Way
galaxy, will also open new opportunities for discovering and monitoring radio
transients. The HIRAX correlator will have the ability to rapidly and
eXperimentciently detect transient events. This new data will shed light on the
poorly understood nature of fast radio bursts (FRBs), enable pulsar monitoring
to enhance long-wavelength gravitational wave searches, and provide a rich data
set for new radio transient phenomena searches. This paper discusses the HIRAX
instrument, science goals, and current status.

for endeavors such as searching for Earth-like planets and solar twins,
understanding the mechanisms that govern stellar evolution, and tracing the

brings with it the need to process this information accurately and rapidly.
While existing methods can constrain fundamental stellar parameters such as
ages, masses, and radii from these observations, they require substantial
computational efforts to do so.
  We develop a method based on machine learning for rapidly estimating
fundamental parameters of main-sequence solar-like stars from classical and
asteroseismic observations. We first demonstrate this method on a
hare-and-hound exercise and then apply it to the Sun, 16 Cyg A & B, and 34

find that our estimates and their associated uncertainties are comparable to
the results of other methods, but with the additional benefit of being able to
explore many more stellar parameters while using much less computation time. We
furthermore use this method to present evidence for an empirical diffusion-mass
relation. Our method is open source and freely available for the community to

well as the influencing factors of signal crosstalk were both analyzed. It is
found that the influencing factors of the RF readout signal strength of the
sensor are mainly quality factors (Q factors) of the LC tanks, coupling
coefficients, and the resonant frequency interval of the two LC tanks. And the
influencing factors of the signal crosstalk are mainly coupling coefficient
between the sensor inductance coils and the resonant frequency interval of the
two LC tanks. The specific influence behavior of corresponding influencing
factors on the signal strength and crosstalk is illustrated by a series of
curves from numerical results simulated by using MATLAB software. Additionally,
a decoupling scheme for solving the crosstalk problem algorithmically was

models groundwater depletion patterns within a multi-agent system framework.
Irrigators are modeled as agents in the multi-agent system. The irrigation
strategies adopted by the agents are investigated using game theory. A set of
five irrigators, growing three crops: corn, sorghum and wheat, have been
considered in this study. To allow groundwater flow, these agents are assumed
to be located in adjoining farm lands. Irrigators are modeled selfish agents
that strategize their irrigation patterns in order to maximize their own
utilities, i.e. the difference between the total revenue obtained from crop
sales and the costs incurred, including groundwater extraction costs. Due to
groundwater flow, and have no incentive to conserve groundwater. This leads to
unsustainable depletion of the resource under Nash equilibrium, when no
irrigator can increase its utility by unilaterally changing its strategy. All
parameters in this research are representative of Kansas. Recorded
environmental and economic data of the region, along with the DSSAT software,
have been used to obtain these futuristic projections. One of the emergent
phenomena of the simulations is the adoption of crop rotation patterns by the
irrigators to conserve groundwater. The irrigators grow corn, which is a more
profitable yet water intensive crop in one year, and in the next, conserve
water by growing sorghum instead. Another emergent outcome of this research is
the viability of LEMAs. When the irrigators are subject to LEMA-level limits on
groundwater use, there is a slight increase in the aggregate utility of the

$\chi_{_\lambda}$ of the subgroup $H$.

observables in Hilbert space, the eigenvalues give the truth values of logical
propositions where the atomic input proposition cases are represented by the
respective eigenvectors. For binary logic using the truth values {0,1} logical
observables are pairwise commuting projectors. For the truth values {+1,-1} the
operator system is formally equivalent to that of a composite spin 1/2 system,
the logical observables being isometries belonging to the Pauli group. Also in
this approach fuzzy logic arises naturally when considering non-eigenvectors.
The fuzzy membership function is obtained by the quantum mean value of the
logical projector observable and turns out to be a probability measure in
agreement with recent quantum cognition models. The analogy of many-valued
logic with quantum angular momentum is then established. Logical observables
for three-value logic are formulated as functions of the Lz observable of the
orbital angular momentum l=1. The representative 3-valued 2-argument logical
observables for the Min and Max connectives are explicitly obtained.

perturbed Minkowski metric are presented. The action functional of the model
involves two functions $f^1(R)$ and $f^2(R)$ of the Ricci scalar curvature $R$.
This work expands upon previous results, extending the framework developed
there to compute corrections up to order $O(1/c^4)$ of the $00$ component of
the metric tensor. It is shown that additional contributions arise due to both
the non-linear form $f^1(R)$ and the nonminimal coupling $f^2(R)$, including
exponential contributions that cannot be expressed as an expansion in powers of
$1/r$. Some possible experimental implications are assessed with application to
perihelion precession.

birth of this theory. Each paradox somewhat shows people's query about the
relativity theory, and solving of each paradox demonstrates the correctness of
relativity theory once again. In this paper, four paradoxes about the special
theory of relativity are brought forward: displacement paradox, electromagnetic
transformation paradox, Doppler paradox and magnetic force paradox. We hope
some researchers can reasonably explain these paradoxes, and then knowledge of
the relativity theory will become more abundant.

local quadratic convergence a popular choice to solve this problem is the
geometric Newton method. The proofs for quadratic convergence either use
computations in a chart or require additional geometric quantities such as
parallel translation. In this short note we provide a direct proof for
quadratic convergence.

large amounts of organic material in the cosmos, particularly in the form of
aromatic compounds. These molecules can be found on the surface of Earth and
Mars, in the atmospheres of the larger planets and on many of their satellites,
on asteroids, comets, meteorites, the atmospheres of red giant stars,
interstellar nebulae, and in the spiral arms of galaxies. Many of these
environments are expected to be of low temperature and pressure, implying that
the Gibbs free energy for the formation of these complex molecules should be
positive and large, suggesting that their existence could only be attributed to
non-equilibrium thermodynamic processes. In this article we first review the
evidence for the abundance of these molecules in the cosmos and then describe
how the ubiquity can be explained from within the framework of non-equilibrium
thermodynamics on the basis of the catalytic properties of these pigment
molecules in dissipating photons of the ultraviolet and visible emission
spectra of neighboring stars, leading to greater local entropy production. A
relation between the maximum wavelength of absorption of these organic pigments
and the corresponding stellar photon environment, provides a guide to
determining which aromatic compounds are most probable in a given stellar
neighborhood, a postulate that can be verified on Earth. It is suggested that
at least some of the baryonic dark matter may be associated with these
molecules which emit in the extreme infrared with many, but weak, emission
lines, thus so far escaping detection. This thermodynamic explanation for the
ubiquity of these organic molecules also has relevance to the possibility of
life, both as we know it, and as we may not know it, throughout the universe.
