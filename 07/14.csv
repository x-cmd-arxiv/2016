of magnetic non-potential characteristics of a rotating sunspot in the active
region (AR) 12158. Vector magnetic field measurements from Helioseismic
Magnetic Imager and coronal EUV observations from Atmospheric Imaging Assembly
reveal that the erupting inverse-S sigmoid had roots in the location of the
rotating sunspot. Sunspot rotates at a rate of 0-5deg/h with increasing trend
in the first half followed by a decrease. Time evolution of many non-potential
parameters had a well correspondence with the sunspot rotation. The evolution
of the AR magnetic structure is approximated by a time series of force free
equilibria. The NLFFF magnetic structure around the sunspot manifests the
observed sigmoid structure. Field lines from the sunspot periphery constitute
the body of the sigmoid and those from interior overly the sigmoid similar to a
fluxrope structure. While the sunspot is being rotating, two major CME
eruptions occurred in the AR. During the first (second) event, the coronal
current concentrations enhanced (degraded) consistent with the photospheric net
vertical current, however the magnetic energy is released during both the
cases. The analysis results suggest that the magnetic connections of the
sigmoid are driven by slow motion of sunspot rotation, which transforms to a
highly twisted flux rope structure in a dynamical scenario. An exceeding
critical twist in the flux rope probably leads to the loss of equilibrium and
thus triggering the onset of two eruptions.

redshift (z>1), characterized by high star formation rates and huge dust
reservoirs. The bright end of this population has been well characterized in
recent years, but considerable uncertainties remain for fainter dusty
star-forming galaxies, which are responsible for the bulk of star formation at
high redshift and thus play a key role in galaxy growth and evolution.
  In this first paper of our series, we describe our methods for finding high
redshift faint dusty galaxies using millimeter observations with ALMA. We
obtained ALMA 1.1 mm mosaic images for three strong-lensing galaxy clusters
from the Frontier Fields survey. The 2'x2' mosaics overlap with the deep HST
WFC3/IR footprints and encompass the high magnification regions of each
cluster. The combination of extremely high ALMA sensitivity and the
magnification power of these clusters allows us to systematically probe the
sub-mJy population of dusty star-forming galaxies over a large surveyed area.
  We present a description of the reduction and analysis of the ALMA continuum
observations for the galaxy clusters Abell 2744 (z=0.308), MACSJ0416.1-2403
(z=0.396) and MACSJ1149.5+2223 (z=0.543), for which we reach observed rms
sensitivities of 55, 59 and 71 $\mu$Jy beam$^{-1}$ respectively. We detect 12
dusty star-forming galaxies at S/N>5.0 across the three clusters, all of them
presenting coincidence with NIR detected counterparts in the HST images. None
of the sources fall close to the lensing caustics, thus they are not strongly
lensed. The observed 1.1 mm flux densities for the total sample of galaxies
range from 0.41 to 2.82 mJy, with observed effective radii spanning <0.05"" to
0.37""$\pm$0.21"". The lensing-corrected sizes of the detected sources appear to
be in the same range as those measured in brighter samples, albeit with
possibly larger dispersion.

in-situ observations from the Advanced Composition Explorer and source AR
measurements from the Solar Dynamic Observatory. The MCs magnetic structure is
reconstructed from the Grad-Shafranov method which reveals a northern component
of the axial field with left-handed helicity. The MC invariant axis is highly
inclined to the ecliptic plane pointing northward and is rotated by $117^o$
with respect to the source region PIL. The net axial flux and current in the MC
are comparatively higher than from the source region. Linear force-free alpha
distribution ($10^{-7}-10^{-6}$ m$^{-1}$) at the sigmoid leg matches the range
of twist number in the MC of 1-2 AU MFR. The MFR is non-linear force-free with
decreasing twist from the axis (9 turns/AU) towards the edge. Therefore
Gold-Hoyle (GH) configuration, assuming a constant twist, is more consistent
with the MC structure than the Lundquist configuration of increasing twist from
the axis to boundary. As an indication to that, the GH configuration yields
better fitting to the global trend of in-situ magnetic field components, in
terms of rms, than the Lundquist model. These cylindrical configurations
improved the MC fitting results when considered the effect of self-similar
expansion of MFR. For such twisting behaviour, this study suggests an
alternative fitting procedure to better characterise the MC magnetic structure
and its source region links.

non-smooth term whose proximal mapping is easy to compute. The best known
iteration complexity for solving such non-smooth optimization problems is
$O(1/\epsilon)$ without any assumption on the strong convexity. In this work,
we will show that the proposed HOPS achieved a lower iteration complexity of
$\widetilde O(1/\epsilon^{1-\theta})$\footnote{$\widetilde O()$ suppresses a
logarithmic factor.} with $\theta\in(0,1]$ capturing the local sharpness of the
objective function around the optimal solutions. To the best of our knowledge,
this is the lowest iteration complexity achieved so far for the considered
non-smooth optimization problems without strong convexity assumption. The HOPS
algorithm employs Nesterov's smoothing technique and Nesterov's accelerated
gradient method and runs in stages, which gradually decreases the smoothing
parameter in a stage-wise manner until it yields a sufficiently good
approximation of the original function. We show that HOPS enjoys a linear
convergence for many well-known non-smooth problems (e.g., empirical risk
minimization with a piece-wise linear loss function and $\ell_1$ norm
regularizer, finding a point in a polyhedron, cone programming, etc).
Experimental results verify the effectiveness of HOPS in comparison with

methods.

extensively in our solar system, it is just beginning to be tested in the
strong gravitational fields that surround black holes. As a way to study the
behavior of gravity in these extreme environments I have used and added to a
ray-tracing code that simulates the X-ray emission from the accretion disks
surrounding black holes. In particular, the observational channels which can be
simulated include the thermal and reflected spectra, polarization, and
reverberation signatures. These calculations can be performed assuming GR as
well as four alternative spacetimes. These results can be used to see if it is
possible to determine if observations can test the No-Hair theorem of GR which
states that stationary, astrophysical black holes are only described by their
mass and spin. Although it proves difficult to distinguish between theories of
gravity it is possible to exclude a large portion of the possible deviations
from GR using observations of rapidly spinning stellar mass black holes such as
Cygnus X-1. The ray-tracing simulations can furthermore be used to study the
inner regions of black hole accretion flows. I examined the dependence of X-ray
reverberation observations on the ionization of the disk photosphere. My
results show that X-ray reverberation and X-ray polarization provides a
powerful tool to constrain the geometry of accretion disks which are too small
to be imaged directly. The second part of my thesis describes the work on the

to be a real effect, what are the implications for the physics case and upgrade
path of the International Linear Collider? Whether or not the resonance is
confirmed, this question provides an interesting case study testing the
robustness of the ILC physics case. In this note, we address this question with
two points: (1) Almost all models proposed for the new 750 GeV particle require
additional new particles with electroweak couplings. The key elements of the
500 GeV ILC physics program---precision measurements of the Higgs boson, the
top quark, and 4-fermion interactions---will powerfully discriminate among
these models. This information will be important in conjunction with new LHC
data, or alone, if the new particles accompanying the 750 GeV resonance are
beyond the mass reach of the LHC. (2) Over a longer term, the energy upgrade of
the ILC to 1 TeV already discussed in the ILC TDR will enable experiments in
gamma-gamma and e+e- collisions to directly produce and study the 750 GeV
particle from these unique initial states.

give rise to microstreams and torsional Alfv\'{e}n waves detected in situ in
the solar wind. To predict and understand the signatures of coronal-hole jets,
we have performed a detailed statistical analysis of such a jet simulated with
an adaptively refined magnetohydrodynamics model. The results confirm the
generation and persistence of three-dimensional, reconnectiondriven magnetic
turbulence in the simulation. We calculate the spatial correlations of magnetic
fluctuations within the jet and find that they agree best with the M\""{u}ller -
Biskamp scaling model including intermittent current sheets of various sizes
coupled via hydrodynamic turbulent cascade. The anisotropy of the magnetic
fluctuations and the spatial orientation of the current sheets are consistent
with an ensemble of nonlinear Alfv\'{e}n waves. These properties also reflect
the overall collimated jet structure imposed by the geometry of the
reconnecting magnetic field. A comparison with Ulysses observations shows that
turbulence in the jet wake is in quantitative agreement with that in the fast
solar wind.

type for elliptic systems on the upper half-space with coefficients independent
of the transversal variable, and with boundary data in fractional
Besov-Hardy-Sobolev (BHS) spaces. Our approach uses minimal assumptions on the
coefficients, and in particular does not require De Giorgi-Nash-Moser
estimates. Our results are completely new for the Hardy-Sobolev case, and in
the Besov case they extend results recently obtained by Barton and Mayboroda.
  First we develop a theory of BHS spaces adapted to operators which are
bisectorial on $L^2$, with bounded $H^\infty$ functional calculus on their
ranges, and which satisfy $L^2$ off-diagonal estimates. In particular, this
theory applies to perturbed Dirac operators $DB$. We then prove that for a
nontrivial range of exponents (the identification region) the BHS spaces
adapted to $DB$ are equal to those adapted to $D$ (which correspond to
classical BHS spaces).
  Our main result is the classification of solutions of the elliptic system
$\operatorname{div} A \nabla u = 0$ within a certain region of exponents. More
precisely, we show that if the conormal gradient of a solution belongs to a
weighted tent space (or one of their real interpolants) with exponent in the
classification region, and in addition vanishes at infinity in a certain sense,
then it has a trace in a BHS space, and can be represented as a semigroup
evolution of this trace in the transversal direction. As a corollary, any such
solution can be represented in terms of an abstract layer potential operator.
Within the classification region, we show that well-posedness is equivalent to
a certain boundary projection being an isomorphism. We derive various
consequences of this characterisation, which are illustrated in various
situations, including in particular that of the Regularity problem for real

rapidly oscillating Ap (roAp) star, HD 24355 ($V=9.65$). The star was
discovered in SuperWASP broadband photometry with a frequency of 224.31
d$^{-1}$, (2596.18 $\mu$Hz; $P = 6.4$ min) and an amplitude of 1.51 mmag, with
later spectroscopic analysis of low-resolution spectra showing HD 24355 to be
an A5 Vp SrEu star. The high precision K2 data allow us to identify 13
rotationally split sidelobes to the main pulsation frequency of HD 24355. This
number of sidelobes combined with an unusual rotational phase variation show
this star to be the most distorted quadrupole roAp pulsator yet observed. In
modelling this star, we are able to reproduce well the amplitude modulation of
the pulsation, and find a close match to the unusual phase variations. We show
this star to have a pulsation frequency higher than the critical cut-off
frequency. This is currently the only roAp star observed with the Kepler
spacecraft in Short Cadence mode that has a photometric amplitude detectable
from the ground, thus allowing comparison between the mmag amplitude
ground-based targets and the $\mu$mag spaced-based discoveries. No further
pulsation modes are identified in the K2 data, showing this star to be a
single-mode pulsator.

emanates from a separate process. Such a scenario is encountered in keystroke
dynamics whereby a user's typing behavior is dependent on the text that is
typed. Under the assumption that the user can be in either an active or passive
state of typing, the keyboard key names are event types that partially reveal
the hidden state due to the presence of relatively longer time intervals
between words and sentences than between letters of a word. Using five public
datasets, the proposed model is shown to consistently outperform other anomaly
detectors, including the standard HMM, in biometric identification and
verification tasks and is generally preferred over the HMM in a Monte Carlo

historical temperature record is often used as a source of empirical
information about climate change. Many historical trend analyses appear to
deemphasize physical and statistical assumptions: examples include regression
models that treat time rather than radiative forcing as the relevant covariate
and time series methods that account for internal variability
nonparametrically. However, given a limited record and the presence of internal
variability, estimating radiatively forced historical temperature trends
necessarily requires assumptions. Ostensibly empirical methods can involve an
inherent conflict in assumptions: they require data records that are short
enough for naive trend models to apply but long enough for internal variability
to be accounted for. In the context of global mean temperatures, methods that
deemphasize assumptions can therefore produce misleading inferences, because
the twentieth century trend is complex and the scale of correlation is long
relative to the data length. We illustrate how a simple but physically
motivated trend model can provide better-fitting and more broadly applicable
trend estimates and can address a wider array of questions. The model allows
one to distinguish, within a single framework, between uncertainties in the
shorter-term versus longer-term response to radiative forcing, with
implications not only on historical trends but also on uncertainties in future
projections. We also investigate the consequence on inferred uncertainties of
the choice of a statistical description of internal variability. While
nonparametric methods may seem to avoid making explicit assumptions, we
demonstrate how even misspecified parametric methods, if attuned to important
characteristics of internal variability, can result in more accurate statements
about trend uncertainty.

infinite order in the sense that the free energy is smaller than any power of

special classes of multishifts, which we refer to as torally balanced and
spherically balanced multishifts. The classification of these two classes is
closely related to toral and spherical polar decompositions of multishifts.
Furthermore, we exhibit a family of spherically balanced multishifts on

Max-Sum, has been applied in the past to the Minimum Steiner Tree Problem on
Graphs and variants. Max-Sum has been shown experimentally to give
asymptotically optimal results on certain types of weighted random graphs, and
to give good solutions in short computation times for some types of real
networks. However, the hypotheses behind the formulation and the cavity method
itself limit substantially the class of instances on which the approach gives
good results (or even converges). Moreover, in the standard model formulation,
the diameter of the tree solution is limited by a predefined bound, that
affects both computation time and convergence properties. In this work we
describe two main enhancements to the Max-Sum equations to be able to cope with
optimization of real-world instances. First, we develop an alternative 'flat'
model formulation, that allows to reduce substantially the relevant
configuration space, making the approach feasible on instances with large
solution diameter, in particular when the number of terminal nodes is small.
Second, we propose an integration between Max-Sum and three greedy heuristics.
This integration allows to transform Max-Sum into a highly competitive
self-contained algorithm, in which a feasible solution is given at each step of
the iterative procedure. Part of this development participated on the 2014

the inverse Rashba-Edelstein effect length (lambda_IREE), increases
dramatically as the film thickness is increased from 2 quintuple layers,
saturating above 6 quintuple layers. This suggests a dominant role of surface

equipartition of magnetic helicity. It depends on the geometry of the initial

the effect of the eruption and reconnection is to add an amount of magnetic

between sectors of the Fock space with different number of particles
(inter-sector interactions) are obtained by extending the domain of the free
Hamiltonian to include functions with singularities. In this paper a similar
but alternative strategy is proposed, in which the inter-sector interactions
are implemented by specific interaction operators. In its simplest form, an
interaction operator is obtained by symmetrizing the asymmetric operator
$\|\hat{\textbf{x}} \|^{-1} \Delta \|\hat {\textbf{x}}\|^{-1}$. The
inter-sector interactions derive from the singularities generated by the
factors $\|\hat{\textbf{x}}\|^{-1}$ enclosing the Laplacian, while the domain
of the interaction operator does not include singular functions. As a
consequence the interaction operators and the free Hamiltonian have a common
dense domain, and they can be added together to form the complete Hamiltonian

Interaction leads to population mass moving from types of smaller mass to those

types is determined by a Bernoulli process and types die when their population
mass is less than a parameter $\epsilon$. We show that if the births are
infrequent, then there are long periods of ""stability"" in which there is no

Use of a finite-difference Jacobian on the GPU---in place of the analytical

handle the Gauss law constraint within sign problem free determinantal quantum
Monte Carlo, at any charge density. For generic charge densities,
$\mathbb{Z}_2$ gauge fluctuations mediate pairing and the ground state is a
gapped superfluid. Superfluidity also appears in the confined phase. This is
reminiscent of the BCS-BEC crossover, except that a true zero temperature
transition occurs here, with the maximum $T_c$ achieved near the transition. At
half-filling also one obtains a large Fermi surface which is gapped at zero
temperature. However, on increasing fermion hopping a $\pi$-flux phase is
spontaneously generated, with emergent Dirac fermions that are stable against
pairing. In contrast to a Fermi liquid of electrons, the change in Fermi
surface volumes of the $\mathbb{Z}_2$ fermions occurs without the breaking of

blazars can be nicely explained by TeV spectra induced by ultra high-energy
cosmic rays.
  Aims. We develop a model for a plausible origin of hard spectra in distant
TeV blazars. Methods. In the model, the TeV emission in distant TeV blazars is
dominated by two mixed components. The first is the internal component with the
photon energy around 1 TeV produced by inverse Compton scattering of the
relativistic electrons on the synchrotron photons (SSC) with a correction for
extragalactic background light absorbtion and the other is the external
component with the photon energy more than 1 TeV produced by the cascade
emission from high-energy protons propagating through intergalactic space.
  Results. Assuming suitable model parameters, we apply the model to observed
spectra of distant TeV blazars of 1ES 0229+200. Our results show that 1) the
observed spectrum properties of 1ES 0229+200, especially the TeV $\gamma$-ray
tail of the observed spectra, could be reproduced in our model and 2) an
expected TeV $\gamma$-ray spectrum with photon energy $>$1 TeV of 1ES 0229+200
should be comparable with the 50-hour sensitivity goal of the Cherenkov
Telescope Array (CTA) and the differential sensitivity curve for the one-year
observation with the Large High Altitude Air Shower Observatory (LHAASO).
  Conclusions. We argue that strong evidence for the Bethe-Heitler cascades
along the line of sight as a plausible origin of hard spectra in distant TeV
blazars could be obtained from VHE observations with CTA, LHAASO, HAWC, and
HiSCORE.

relative magnetization orientations in the ferromagnets can result in
substantial variations in the transition temperature $T_c$, consistent with
experiment [Singh et al., Phys. Rev. X 5, 021019 (2015)]. Our results
demonstrate that, in good agreement with the experiment, the variations are
largest in the case where $F_2$ is in a half-metallic phase and thus supports
only one spin direction. To pinpoint the origins of this strong spin-valve
effect, both the equal-spin $f_1$ and opposite-spin $f_0$ triplet correlations
are calculated using a self-consistent microscopic technique. We find that when
the magnetization in $F_1$ is tilted slightly out-of-plane, the $f_1$ component
can be the dominant triplet component in the superconductor. The coupling
between the two ferromagnets is discussed in terms of the underlying spin
currents present in the system. We go further and show that the zero energy
peaks of the local density of states probed on the $S$ side of the valve can be
another signature of the presence of superconducting triplet correlations. Our
findings reveal that for sufficiently thin $S$ layers, the zero energy peak at
the $S$ side can be larger than its counterpart in the $F_2$ side.

Combining our measurement of (D/H)_P with these BBN calculations yields an
estimate of the cosmic baryon density, 100 Omega_B,0 h^2(BBN) = 2.156 +/-
0.020, if we adopt the most recent theoretical determination of the
d(p,gamma)3He reaction rate. This measure of Omega_B,0 h^2 differs by ~2.3

estimate 100 Omega_B,0 h^2(BBN) = 2.260 +/- 0.034, which is in somewhat better
agreement with the Planck value. Forthcoming measurements of the crucial

which, assuming Eddington-limited accretion and other considerations, makes it
one of the best intermediate-mass black hole (IMBH) candidates. However, the
ULX may still be explained by super-Eddington accretion onto a stellar-remnant
black hole. We present simultaneous NuSTAR, Chandra and Swift/XRT observations
during the peak of a flaring episode with the aim of modeling the emission of
M82 X-1 and yielding insights into its nature. We find that thin-accretion disk
models all require accretion rates at or above the Eddington limit in order to
reproduce the spectral shape, given a range of black hole masses and spins.
Since at these high Eddington ratios the thin-disk model breaks down due to
radial advection in the disk, we discard the results of the thin-disk models as
unphysical. We find that the temperature profile as a function of disk radius
($T(r)\propto r^{-p}$) is significantly flatter ($p=0.55^{+ 0.07}_{- 0.04}$)
than expected for a standard thin disk ($p=0.75$). A flatter profile is instead
characteristic of a slim disk which is highly suggestive of super-Eddington
accretion. Furthermore, radiation hydrodynamical simulations of super-Eddington
accretion have shown that the predicted spectra of these systems are very
similar to what we observe for M82 X-1. We therefore conclude that M82 X-1 is a
super-Eddington accretor. Our mass estimates inferred from the inner disk
radius imply a stellar-remnant black hole ($M_{\rm BH}=26^{+9}_{-6} M_{\odot}$)
when assuming zero spin, or an IMBH ($M_{\rm BH}=125^{+45}_{-30} M_{\odot}$)

UKIDSS-UDS, COSMOS, Akari-NEP, Extended Groth Strip, Lockman Hole North, SSA22

approaching the SCUBA-2 850um confusion limit, which we determine to be ~0.8
mJy/beam. We measure the single dish 850um number counts to unprecedented
accuracy, reducing the Poisson errors on the differential counts to
approximately 4% at S_850~3mJy. With several independent fields, we investigate
field-to-field variance, finding that the number counts on 0.5-1 degree scales

consistent with the Poisson and estimated cosmic variance uncertainties,
although there is a marginal (2-sigma) density enhancement in the GOODS-North

phenomenological and semi-analytic models. Finally, the large solid angle of
S2CLS allows us to measure the bright-end counts: at S_850>10mJy there are
approximately ten sources per square degree, and we detect the distinctive
up-turn in the number counts indicative of the detection of local sources of
850um emission and strongly lensed high-redshift galaxies. Here we describe the

also the total number of galaxies, is a fundamental question with implications
for a host of astrophysical problems including galaxy evolution and cosmology.
However there has never been a detailed study of this important measurement,
nor a clear path to answer it. To address this we use observed galaxy stellar
mass functions up to $z\sim8$ to determine how the number densities of galaxies
changes as a function of time and mass limit. We show that the increase in the
total number density of galaxies ($\phi_{\rm T}$), more massive than M$_{*} =
10^{6}$ M_0, decreases as $\phi_{\rm T} \sim t^{-1}$, where $t$ is the age of
the universe. We further show that this evolution turns-over and rather
increases with time at higher mass lower limits of M$_{*}>10^{7}$ M_0. By using
the M$_{*}=10^{6}$ M_0 lower limit we further show that the total number of
galaxies in the universe up to $z = 8$ is $2.0^{+0.7}_{-0.6} \times 10^{12}$
(two trillion), almost a factor of ten higher than would be seen in an all sky
survey at Hubble Ultra-Deep Field depth. We discuss the implications for these
results for galaxy evolution, as well as compare our results with the latest
models of galaxy formation. These results also reveal that the cosmic
background light in the optical and near-infrared likely arise from these
unobserved faint galaxies. We also show how these results solve the question of
why the sky at night is dark, otherwise known as Olbers' paradox.

conserved quantities but are not integrable, and have rather rich phase
diagrams consisting of several exotic phases and phase transitions that lie
beyond Landau-Ginzburg paradigm. In particular, one of the prominent phase for
$N>1$ corresponds to $2N$ gapless Dirac fermions coupled to an emergent
$\mathbb{Z}_2$ gauge field in its deconfined phase. However, unlike a
conventional $\mathbb{Z}_2$ gauge theory, we do not impose the `Gauss's Law' by

Correspondingly, unlike a conventional $\mathbb{Z}_2$ gauge theory in two
spatial dimensions, our models have a finite temperature phase transition
associated with the melting of the order parameter that dynamically imposes the
Gauss's law constraint at zero temperature. By tuning a parameter, the
deconfined phase undergoes a transition into a short range entangled phase,
which corresponds to N\'eel/Superconductor for $N=2$ and a Valence Bond Solid
for $N=3$. Furthermore, for $N=3$, the Valence Bond Solid further undergoes a
transition to a N\'eel phase consistent with the deconfined quantum critical

in theoretical computer science. For graphs $G$ and $H$, it asks whether they
are the same up to a relabeling of vertices. In 1981, Lubiw proved that list
restricted graph isomorphism (ListIso) is NP-complete: for each $u \in V(G)$,
we are given a list ${\mathfrak L}(u) \subseteq V(H)$ of possible images of
$u$. After 35 years, we revive the study of this problem and consider which
results for GraphIso translate to ListIso.
  We prove the following: 1) When GraphIso is GI-complete for a class of
graphs, it translates into NP-completeness of ListIso. 2) Combinatorial
algorithms for GraphIso translate into algorithms for ListIso: for trees,
planar graphs, interval graphs, circle graphs, permutation graphs, bounded
genus graphs, and bounded treewidth graphs. 3) Algorithms based on group theory
do not translate: ListIso remains NP-complete for cubic colored graphs with
sizes of color classes bounded by 8.
  Also, ListIso allows to classify results for the graph isomorphism problem.
Some algorithms are robust and translate to ListIso. A fundamental problem is
to construct a combinatorial polynomial-time algorithm for cubic graph
isomorphism, avoiding group theory. By the 3rd result, ListIso is NP-hard for
them, so no robust algorithm for cubic graph isomorphism exists, unless P = NP.

write an effective time-dependent model for the dynamics of the system coupled

applying this procedure to the Heisenberg equations of motion, we derive a set
of flow equations for the system parameters as a function of time. The final

increasing collision energy we identify the Wigner threshold for p-wave

collisions at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) and the Large Hadron
Collider (LHC) has been to study the properties of QCD matter under extreme
conditions -high temperature and high density. The heavy-ion experiments at
both RHIC and LHC have recorded a wealth of data in p+p, p+Pb, d+Au, Cu+Cu,
Cu+Au, Au+Au, Pb+Pb and U+U collisions at energies ranging from $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$
= 7.7 GeV to 7 TeV. Heavy quarks are considered good probe to study the QCD
matter created in relativistic collisions due to their very large mass and
other unique properties. A precise measurement of various properties of heavy
flavor hadrons provides an insight into the fundamental properties of the hot
and dense medium created in these nuclei-nuclei collisions, such as transport
coefficient and thermalization and hadronization mechanisms. The main focus of
this paper is to present a review on the measurements of azimuthal anisotropy
of heavy flavor hadrons and to outline the scientific opportunities in this
sector due to future detector upgrade. We will mainly discuss the elliptic flow
of open charmed meson ($D$-meson), $J/\psi$ and leptons from heavy flavor decay
at RHIC and LHC energy.

interaction of a shock with a dense, filamentary cloud. We investigate the
effects of various filament lengths and orientations on the interaction using
different orientations of the magnetic field, and vary the Mach number of the
shock, the density contrast of the filament, and the plasma beta, in order to
determine their effect on the evolution and lifetime of the filament. We find
that in a parallel magnetic field filaments have longer lifetimes if they are
orientated more 'broadside' to the shock front, and that an increase in the
density contrast hastens the destruction of the cloud, in terms of the modified
cloud-crushing time-scale, tcs. The combination of a mild shock and a
perpendicular or oblique field provides the best condition for extending the
life of the filament, with some filaments able to survive almost indefinitely
since they are cocooned by the magnetic field. A high value for the density
contrast does not initiate large turbulent instabilities in either the
perpendicular or oblique field cases but rather draws the filament out into
long tendrils which may eventually fragment. In addition, flux ropes are only
formed in parallel magnetic fields. The length of the filament is, however, not
as important for the evolution and destruction of a filament.

refinement, and only a mild dependence on the polynomial order of high-order
finite element discretizations ($Q_k \times P_{k-1}^{disc}$, order $k \ge 2$).
For certain difficult problems, we demonstrate numerically that w-BFBT
significantly improves Stokes solver convergence over the widely used inverse
viscosity-weighted pressure mass matrix approximation of the Schur complement.
In addition, we derive theoretical eigenvalue bounds to prove spectral
equivalence of w-BFBT. Using detailed numerical experiments, we discuss
modifications to w-BFBT at Dirichlet boundaries that decrease the number of

governed by the efficacy of w-BFBT as a Schur complement approximation and, in
addition, by our parallel hybrid spectral-geometric-algebraic multigrid (HMG)

misalignment between the spin axes of the host stars and the orbital angular
momentum axes of the planets (""spin-orbit misalignment""). High-eccentricity
migration involving Lidov-Kozai oscillations of the planet's orbit induced by a
distant perturber is a possible channel for producing such misaligned HJ
systems. Previous works have shown that the dynamical evolution of the stellar
spin axis during the high-$e$ migration plays a dominant role in generating the
observed spin-orbit misalignment. Numerical studies have also revealed various
patterns of the evolution of the stellar spin axis leading to the final
misalignment. Here we develop an analytic theory to elucidate the evolution of
spin-orbit misalignment during the Lidov-Kozai migration of planets in stellar
binaries. Secular spin-orbit resonances play a key role in the misalignment
evolution. We include the effects of short-range forces and tidal dissipation,
and categorize the different possible paths to spin-orbit misalignment as a
function of various physical parameters (e.g. planet mass and stellar rotation
period). We identify five distinct spin-orbit evolution paths and outcomes,
only two of which are capable of producing retrograde orbits. We show that
these paths to misalignment and the outcomes depend only on two dimensionless
parameters, which compare the stellar spin precession frequency with the rate
of change of the planet's orbital axis, and the Lidov-Kozai oscillation
frequency. Our analysis reveals a number of novel phenomena for the stellar
spin evolution, ranging from bifurcation, adiabatic advection, to fully chaotic
evolution of spin-orbit angles.

covert channel which, unlike other optical methods, is also stealthy. Our
method exploits the limitations of human visual perception in order to
unobtrusively leak data through a standard computer LCD display. Our
experiments show that very low contrast or fast flickering images which are
invisible to human subjects, can be recovered from photos taken by a camera.
Consequentially, we show that malicious code on a compromised computer can
obtain sensitive data (e.g., images, encryption keys, passwords), and project
it onto a computer LCD screen, invisible and unbeknownst to users, allowing an
attacker to reconstruct the data using a photo taken by a nearby (possibly
hidden) camera. In order to demonstrate the feasibility of this type of attack
and evaluate the channel's stealth, we conducted a battery of tests with 40
human subjects. We also examined the channel's boundaries under various
parameters, with different types of encoded objects, at several distances, and
using several kinds of cameras. Our results show that binary data can be leaked
via our covert channel. Further research and discussion may widen the scope of
this field beyond its current boundaries, yielding novel attack paradigms that
exploit the subtle mechanisms of human visual perception.

simultaneously as the collection of all light rays observed. We show how the
distributed camera model is a generalization of the standard camera model and
describe a general formulation and solution to the absolute camera pose problem
that works for standard or distributed cameras. The proposed method computes a
solution that is up to 8 times more efficient and robust to rotation
singularities in comparison with gDLS. Finally, this method is used in an novel
large-scale incremental SfM pipeline where distributed cameras are accurately
and robustly merged together. This pipeline is a direct generalization of
traditional incremental SfM; however, instead of incrementally adding one
camera at a time to grow the reconstruction the reconstruction is grown by
adding a distributed camera. Our pipeline produces highly accurate
reconstructions efficiently by avoiding the need for many bundle adjustment
iterations and is capable of computing a 3D model of Rome from over 15,000

technique for imaging nascent messenger RNA in living Drosophila embryos allows
us to quantify the dynamics of the developmental transcription process. The
initial measurement of the morphogens by the hunchback promoter takes place
during very short cell cycles, not only giving each nucleus little time for a
precise readout, but also resulting in short time traces of transcription.
Additionally, the relationship between the measured signal and the promoter

analysis approach based on tailor made autocorrelation functions that overcomes
the short trace problems and quantifies the dynamics of transcription
initiation. Based on live imaging data, we identify signatures of bursty
transcription initiation from the hunchback promoter. We show that the
precision of the expression of the hunchback gene to measure its position along
the anterior-posterior axis is low both at the boundary and in the anterior

systems with input-output time-delays are not passive. On the other hand,
time-delays are unavoidable in automotive systems and commonly emerge in
software implementations and communication units as well as driver's behavior.
We show that by using our passivation method, we can passivate the system and
improve its overall performance. Our simulation examples in CarSim and Simulink

fundamental problem in various areas of computer science. As the amount of data
is often huge, it is desirable to obtain sublinear time algorithms, and
specifically property testers, to understand local properties of the data.
  We focus on the natural local problem of testing pattern freeness: given a
large $d$-dimensional array $A$ and a fixed $d$-dimensional pattern $P$ over a
finite alphabet, we say that $A$ is $P$-free if it does not contain a copy of
the forbidden pattern $P$ as a consecutive subarray. The distance of $A$ to
$P$-freeness is the fraction of entries of $A$ that need to be modified to make
it $P$-free. For any $\epsilon \in [0,1]$ and any large enough pattern $P$ over
any alphabet, other than a very small set of exceptional patterns, we design a
tolerant tester that distinguishes between the case that the distance is at
least $\epsilon$ and the case that it is at most $a_d \epsilon$, with query
complexity and running time $c_d \epsilon^{-1}$, where $a_d < 1$ and $c_d$
depend only on $d$.
  To analyze the testers we establish several combinatorial results, including
the following $d$-dimensional modification lemma, which might be of independent
interest: for any large enough pattern $P$ over any alphabet (excluding a small
set of exceptional patterns for the binary case), and any array $A$ containing
a copy of $P$, one can delete this copy by modifying one of its locations
without creating new $P$-copies in $A$.
  Our results address an open question of Fischer and Newman, who asked whether
there exist efficient testers for properties related to tight substructures in
multi-dimensional structured data. They serve as a first step towards a general
understanding of local properties of multi-dimensional arrays, as any such
property can be characterized by a fixed family of forbidden patterns.

1000K) can exists out to much larger distances as seen in emission maps.
Therefore, the process of condensation of warm to cold HI is likely occurring
in stages from ionized to warm HI in the inner halo and then to cold HI very
close to the galaxy disk.

peculiar velocities and gravitational lensing, and the sensitivity of these
effects to the amplitude of the matter power spectrum. We use the MeMo lensing
likelihood developed by Quartin, Marra & Amendola (2014), which accounts for
the characteristic non-Gaussian distribution caused by lensing magnification
with measurements of the first four central moments of the distribution of
magnitudes. We build on the MeMo likelihood by including the effects of
peculiar velocities directly into the model for the moments. In order to
measure the moments from sparse numbers of supernovae, we take a new approach
using Kernel Density Estimation to estimate the underlying probability density
function of the magnitude residuals. We also describe a bootstrap re-sampling
approach to estimate the data covariance matrix. We then apply the method to
the Joint Light-curve Analysis (JLA) supernova catalogue. When we impose only
that the intrinsic dispersion in magnitudes is independent of redshift, we find
$\sigma_8=0.44^{+0.63}_{-0.44}$ at the one standard deviation level, although
we note that in tests on simulations, this model tends to overestimate the
magnitude of the intrinsic dispersion, and underestimate $\sigma_8$. We note
that the degeneracy between intrinsic dispersion and the effects of $\sigma_8$
is more pronounced when lensing and velocity effects are considered
simultaneously, due to a cancellation of redshift dependence when both effects
are included. Keeping the model of the intrinsic dispersion fixed as a Gaussian
distribution of width 0.14 mag, we find $\sigma_8 = 1.07^{+0.50}_{-0.76}$.

via tensor augmentation and completion (ICTAC), which recovers missing entries
of color images with high accuracy. Typical images are second- or third-order
tensors (2D/3D) depending if they are grayscale or color, hence tensor
completion algorithms are ideal for their recovery. The proposed framework
performs image completion by concatenating copies of a single image that has
missing entries into a third-order tensor, applying a dimensionality
augmentation technique to the tensor, utilizing a tensor completion algorithm
for recovering its missing entries, and finally extracting the recovered image
from the tensor. The solution relies on two key components that have been
recently proposed to take advantage of the tensor train (TT) rank: A tensor
augmentation tool called ket augmentation (KA) that represents a low-order
tensor by a higher-order tensor, and the algorithm tensor completion by
parallel matrix factorization via tensor train (TMac-TT), which has been
demonstrated to outperform state-of-the-art tensor completion algorithms.
Simulation results for color image recovery show the clear advantage of our
framework against current state-of-the-art tensor completion algorithms.

move at the Fermi velocity $v_F$. Consequently, there is Klein tunneling at a

radial pressure: one that is null at the star's surface defined by $p_r(R)=0$,
and one that is nonnull on at the surface, namely, $\sigma_s=0$ and
$\sigma_s\neq0$. In the case $\sigma_s=0$, the maximum mass value and the zero
frequency of oscillation are found at the same central energy density,
indicating that the maximum mass marks the onset of the instability. For the
case $\sigma_s\neq0$, we show that the maximum mass point and the zero
frequency of oscillation coincide in the same central energy density value only
in a sequence of equilibrium configurations with the same value of $\sigma_s$.
Thus, the stability star regions are determined always by the condition
$dM/d\rho_c>0$ only when the tangential pressure is maintained fixed at the
star surface's $p_t(R)$. These results are also quite important to analyze the
stability of other anisotropic compact objects such as neutron stars, boson
stars and gravastars.

less important and the fluctuations of nuclear spins become the dominant
decoherence mechanism for electron spins. Since 1950s, semiclassical noise
theories have been developed for understanding electron spin decoherence. In

nanometer scale and the nuclear spin baths are quantum objects which require a
quantum description. Recently, quantum pictures have been established to
understand the decoherence and quantum many-body theories have been developed
to quantitatively describe this phenomenon. Anomalous quantum effects have been
predicted and some have been experimentally confirmed. A systematically
truncated cluster correlation expansion theory has been developed to account
for the many-body correlations in nanoscale nuclear spin baths that are built
up during the electron spin decoherence. The theory has successfully predicted
and explained a number of experimental results in a wide range of physical
systems. In this review, we will cover these recent progresses. The limitations

population of planetary systems with orbital configurations ranging from
single-transiting planets to systems of multiple planets co-transiting the
parent star. By comparing the relative occurrences of multiple to
single-transiting systems, recent analyses have revealed a significant
over-abundance of singles. Dubbed the ""Kepler Dichotomy,"" this feature has been
interpreted as evidence for two separate populations of planetary systems: one
where all orbits are confined to a single plane, and a second where the
constituent planetary orbits possess significant mutual inclinations, allowing
only a single member to be observed in transit at a given epoch. In this work,
we demonstrate that stellar obliquity, excited within the disk-hosting stage,
can explain this dichotomy. Young stars rotate rapidly, generating a
significant quadrupole moment which torques the planetary orbits, with inner
planets influenced more strongly. Given nominal parameters, this torque is
sufficiently strong to excite significant mutual inclinations between planets,
enhancing the number of single-transiting planets, sometimes through a
dynamical instability. Furthermore, as hot stars appear to possess
systematically higher obliquities, we predict that single-transiting systems
should be relatively more prevalent around more massive stars. We analyze the
Kepler data and confirm this signal to be present.

detect whether an $n$-vertex directed graph $G$ has a Hamiltonian cycle in time
significantly less than $2^n$? We present new randomized algorithms that
improve upon several previous works:
  1. We show that for any constant $0<\lambda<1$ and prime $p$ we can count the
Hamiltonian cycles modulo $p^{\lfloor (1-\lambda)\frac{n}{3p}\rfloor}$ in
expected time less than $c^n$ for a constant $c<2$ that depends only on $p$ and
$\lambda$. Such an algorithm was previously known only for the case of counting
modulo two [Bj\""orklund and Husfeldt, FOCS 2013].
  2. We show that we can detect a Hamiltonian cycle in $O^*(3^{n-\alpha(G)})$
time and polynomial space, where $\alpha(G)$ is the size of the maximum
independent set in $G$. In particular, this yields an $O^*(3^{n/2})$ time
algorithm for bipartite directed graphs, which is faster than the
exponential-space algorithm in [Cygan et al., STOC 2013].
  Our algorithms are based on the algebraic combinatorics of ""incidence
assignments"" that we can capture through evaluation of determinants of
Laplacian-like matrices, inspired by the Matrix--Tree Theorem for directed
graphs. In addition to the novel algorithms for directed Hamiltonicity, we use
the Matrix--Tree Theorem to derive simple algebraic algorithms for detecting
out-branchings. Specifically, we give an $O^*(2^k)$-time randomized algorithm
for detecting out-branchings with at least $k$ internal vertices, improving
upon the algorithms of [Zehavi, ESA 2015] and [Bj\""orklund et al., ICALP 2015].

multiplexing (GFDM) is considered under two design criteria: rate maximization
and out-of-band (OOB) emission minimization. First, the problem of GFDM filter
optimization for rate maximization is formulated by expressing the transmission
rate of GFDM as a function of GFDM filter coefficients. It is shown that
Dirichlet filters are rate-optimal in additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN)
channels with no carrier frequency offset (CFO) under linear zero-forcing (ZF)
or minimum mean-square error (MMSE) receivers, but in general channels
perturbed by CFO a properly designed nontrivial GFDM filter can yield better
performance than Dirichlet filters by adjusting the subcarrier waveform to cope
with the channel-induced CFO. Next, the problem of GFDM filter design for OOB
emission minimization is formulated by expressing the power spectral density

detected magnetic resonance spectroscopy, we first find that the electron spin
transition frequency can be tuned down to 100 kHz for the \NV{14} centre, while
for the \NV{15} centre the transition strength vanishes for frequencies below
about 2 MHz owing to the GSLAC level structure. Using optical pulses to prepare
and readout the spin state, we observe coherent spin oscillations at 1024 G for
the \NV{14}, which originate from spin mixing induced by residual transverse
magnetic fields. This effect is responsible for limiting the smallest
observable transition frequency, which can span two orders of magnitude from
100 kHz to tens of MHz depending on the local magnetic noise. A similar feature
is observed for the \NV{15} centre at 1024 G. As an application of these
findings, we demonstrate all-optical detection and spectroscopy of
externally-generated fluctuating magnetic fields at frequencies from 8 MHz down

turbulence in a channel are studied by means of Direct Numerical Simulation
(DNS) of the low-Mach number approximation of the Navier--Stokes equations.
Different constitutive relations for density and viscosity as a function of
temperature are used in order to mimic a wide range of fluid behaviours and to
develop a generalised framework for studying turbulence modulations in variable
property flows. Instead of scaling the velocity solely based on local density,
as done for the van Driest transformation, we derive an extension of the
scaling that is based on gradients of the semi-local Reynolds number
$Re_\tau^*$. This extension of the van Driest transformation is able to
collapse velocity profiles for flows with near-wall property gradients as a
function of the semi-local wall coordinate. However, flow quantities like
mixing length, turbulence anisotropy and turbulent vorticity fluctuations do
not show a universal scaling very close to the wall. This is attributed to
turbulence modulations, which play a crucial role on the evolution of turbulent
structures and turbulence energy transfer. We therefore investigate the
characteristics of streamwise velocity streaks and quasi-streamwise vortices
and found that, similar to turbulent statistics, the turbulent structures are
also strongly governed by $Re_\tau^*$ profiles and that their dependence on
individual density and viscosity profiles is minor. Flows with near-wall
gradients in $Re_\tau^*$ ($d {Re_\tau^*}/dy \neq 0$) showed significant changes
in the inclination and tilting angles of quasi-streamwise vortices. These
structural changes are responsible for the observed modulation of the Reynolds
stress generation mechanism and the inter-component energy transfer in flows
with strong near-wall $Re_\tau^*$ gradients.

standard picture of structure formation with non-baryonic dark matter. Recently
Tully et al. (2015) reported the discovery of two almost parallel planes in the
nearby Cen A group using mostly high-mass galaxies (M$_B$ $<$ -10 mag) in their
analysis. Our team detected a large number of new group member candidates in
the Cen A group (M\""uller et al. 2016). This dwarf galaxy sample combined with
other recent results from the literature enables us to test the galaxy
distribution in the direction of the Cen A group and to determine the
statistical significance of the geometric alignment. Taking advantage of the
fact that the two galaxy planes lie almost edge-on along the line of sight, the
newly found 13 group members by Crnojevic et al. (2014, 2016) and our 16 new
Cen A group candidates (M\""uller et al. 2016) can be assigned relative to the
two planes. We use various statistical methods to test whether the distribution
of galaxies follows a single normal distribution or shows evidence of
bimodality as it has been reported earlier. We confirm that the data used for
the Tully et al. (2015) study support the picture of a bimodal structure.
However, when the new galaxy samples are included, the gap between the two
galaxy planes is closing and the significance level of the bimodality is
reduced. Instead, the plane that contains Cen A becomes more prominent. We
found evidence that the galaxy system around Cen A is made up of only one plane
of satellites. This plane is almost orthogonal to the dust plane of Cen A.

defined via the nonnegativity of the $(n+1)$st order divided differences of a

  The aim of this paper is to apply the notion of higher-order divided

introduced by Karlin in 1968. Using a determinant identity of Sylvester, we
then establish a formula for the generalized divided differences which enables
us to obtain a new characterization of convexity with respect to Chebyshev

emission in 2006. To date, the exact origin of this emission has remained
unclear, although a tight spatial correlation between the density distribution
of the molecular material of the Central Molecular Zone (CMZ) and the
morphology of the observed gamma-ray excess points towards a hadronic
production scenario. In this proceeding, we present a numerical study of the
propagation of high-energy cosmic rays (CRs) through a turbulent environment
such as the GC region. In our analysis, we derive an energy-dependent
parametrization for the diffusion coefficient which we use for our simulation
of the diffuse gamma-ray emission at the GC. Assuming that hadronic CRs have
been released by a single impulsive event at the center of our Galaxy, we probe
the question whether or not the interaction processes of the diffusing hadrons
with ambient matter can explain the observed diffuse gamma-ray excess. Our
results disfavor this scenario, as our analysis indicates that the diffusion
process is, on timescales compared to the typical proton lifetime at the GC
region, too slow to explain the extension of the observed emission.

nanowires on Si(111) by photoluminescence and cathodoluminescence spectroscopy.
This band is found to be particularly prominent for samples synthesized at
comparatively low temperatures. At the same time, these samples exhibit a
peculiar morphology, namely, isolated long nanowires are interspersed within a
dense matrix of short ones. Cathodoluminescence intensity maps reveal the
3.45-eV band to originate primarily from the long nanowires. Transmission
electron microscopy shows that these long nanowires are either Ga polar and are
joined by an inversion domain boundary with their short N-polar neighbors, or
exhibit a Ga-polar core surrounded by a N-polar shell with a tubular inversion
domain boundary at the core/shell interface. For samples grown at high
temperatures, which exhibit a uniform nanowire morphology, the 3.45-eV band is
also found to originate from particular nanowires in the ensemble and thus
presumably from inversion domain boundaries stemming from the coexistence of N-
and Ga-polar nanowires. For several of the investigated samples, the 3.45-eV
band splits into a doublet. We demonstrate that the higher-energy component of
this doublet arises from the recombination of two-dimensional excitons free to
move in the plane of the inversion domain boundary. In contrast, the
lower-energy component of the doublet originates from excitons localized in the
plane of the inversion domain boundary. We propose that this in-plane
localization is due to shallow donors in the vicinity of the inversion domain
boundaries.

the yields of both molecular and six-quark states are much larger than the

is much larger than the experimental upper-limits, the six-quark-state yield
could be lower than the upper-limits. The higher molecule-state yields are
mainly due to the large contribution of short-lived strong resonance decays
into (anti-)nucleons and (anti-)$\Lambda$ which can significantly enhance the
molecule-state yields of $\Lambda\Lambda$ and $\overline{\Lambda \text{n}}$ via
hadron coalescence. Our results suggest that the current experimental

intervention or treatment decision-making at the cluster level in order to
improve outcomes at the individual or patient-level. In a cluster-level DTR,
the intervention or treatment is potentially adapted and re-adapted over time
based on changes in the cluster that could be impacted by prior intervention,
including based on aggregate measures of the individuals or patients that
comprise it. Cluster-randomized sequential multiple assignment randomized
trials (SMARTs) can be used to answer multiple open questions preventing
scientists from developing high-quality cluster-level DTRs. In a
cluster-randomized SMART, sequential randomizations occur at the cluster level
and outcomes are at the individual level. This manuscript makes two
contributions to the design and analysis of cluster-randomized SMARTs: First, a
weighted least squares regression approach is proposed for comparing the mean
of a patient-level outcome between the cluster-level DTRs embedded in a SMART.
The regression approach facilitates the use of baseline covariates which is
often critical in the analysis of cluster-level trials. Second, sample size
calculators are derived for two common cluster-randomized SMART designs for use
when the primary aim is a between-DTR comparison of the mean of a continuous
patient-level outcome. The methods are motivated by the Adaptive Implementation
of Effective Programs Trial, which is, to our knowledge, the first-ever
cluster-randomized SMART in psychiatry.

dominant black hole, the formation of a new jet with significant particle
acceleration and interaction with the surrounding material, with the
corresponding increased radio flux. Doppler boosting from the underlying jet
pointing to the Earth makes it possible to identify the origin of the

gigahertz-peaked-spectrum radio sources. Finally, we derive the
Euclidean-normalised differential source counts using the catalogue compiled in

differential source counts are consistent with both previous observations at
this frequency and models of the low-frequency source population. These
represent the deepest source counts yet derived at 325 MHz. Our source counts
exhibit the well-known flattening at mJy flux densities, consistent with an
emerging population of star-forming galaxies; we also find marginal evidence of

scheme has many other remarkable advantages. Furthermore, this indexing scheme
can be easily generalized to clusters on other high-symmetry lattices. Our work

continuous-wave ultraviolet laser radiation, and lead to the formation of
long-range Cs$_2$ molecules. We observe two types of molecular resonances. The
first type originates from the correlated excitation of two atoms into
Rydberg-atom-pair states interacting at long range via multipole-multipole
interactions. The second type results from the interaction of one atom excited
to a Rydberg state with one atom in the electronic ground state. Which type of
resonances is observed in the experiments depends on the laser intensity and

pseudo-potential for the second type of resonances. We analyse the relation of
these long-range molecular resonances to molecular Rydberg states and ion-pair

chemical abundances consistently with the temperature structure for the
atmospheres of highly-irradiated, close-in gas giant exoplanets. Chemical
kinetics models have been widely used in the literature to investigate the
chemical compositions of hot Jupiter atmospheres which are expected to be
driven away from chemical equilibrium via processes such as vertical mixing and
photochemistry. All of these models have so far used pressure--temperature
(P-T) profiles as fixed model input. This results in a decoupling of the
chemistry from the radiative and thermal properties of the atmosphere, despite
the fact that in nature they are intricately linked. We use a one-dimensional
radiative-convective equilibrium model, ATMO, which includes a sophisticated
chemistry scheme to calculate P-T profiles which are fully consistent with
non-equilibrium chemical abundances, including vertical mixing and
photochemistry. Our primary conclusion is that, in cases of strong chemical
disequilibrium, consistent calculations can lead to differences in the P-T
profile of up to 100 K compared to the P-T profile derived assuming chemical
equilibrium. This temperature change can, in turn, have important consequences
for the chemical abundances themselves as well as for the simulated emission
spectra. In particular, we find that performing the chemical kinetics
calculation consistently can reduce the overall impact of non-equilibrium
chemistry on the observable emission spectrum of hot Jupiters. Simulated
observations derived from non-consistent models could thus yield the wrong
interpretation. We show that this behaviour is due to the non-consistent models
violating the energy budget balance of the atmosphere.

great importance for studies of galaxy evolution as they may be tracing early,
short-lived stages of starbursts and active galactic nuclei (AGNs). The most
extreme FIR-excess galaxy NGC1377 has long been interpreted as a young dusty
starburst, but millimeter observations of CO lines revealed a powerful
collimated molecular outflow which cannot be explained by star formation alone.
We present new radio observations at 1.5 and 10 GHz obtained with the Jansky
Very Large Array (JVLA) and Chandra X-ray observations towards NGC1377. The
observations are compared to synthetic starburst models to constrain the
properties of the central energy source. We obtained the first detection of the
cm radio continuum and X-ray emission in NGC1377. We find that the radio
emission is distributed in two components, one on the nucleus and another
offset by 4$""$.5 to the South-West. We confirm the extreme FIR-excess of the
galaxy, with a $q_\mathrm{FIR}\simeq$4.2, which deviates by more than
7-$\sigma$ from the radio-FIR correlation. Soft X-ray emission is detected on
the off-nucleus component. From the radio emission we estimate for a young
($<10$ Myr) starburst a star formation rate SFR$<$0.1 M$_\odot$ yr$^{-1}$. Such
a SFR is not sufficient to power the observed IR luminosity and to drive the CO
outflow. We find that a young starburst cannot reproduce all the observed
properties of the nucleus of NGC1377. We suggest that the galaxy may be
harboring a radio-quiet, obscured AGN of 10$^6$M$_\odot$, accreting at
near-Eddington rates. We speculate that the off-nucleus component may be
tracing an hot-spot in the AGN jet.

is the subject of investigation in this work. To this end we studied the
evolution of four starless cores, B68, L694-2, L1517B, L1689, and L1521F, a
VeLLO. The density profile of a typical core extracted from an earlier
simulation developed to study core-formation in a molecular cloud was used for
the purpose. We demonstrate - (i) cores contracted in quasistatic manner over a
timescale on the order of $\sim 10^{5}$ years. Those that remained starless did
briefly acquire a centrally concentrated density configuration that mimicked
the density profile of a unstable Bonnor Ebert sphere before rebounding, (ii)
three of our test cores viz. L694-2, L1689-SMM16 and L1521F remained starless
despite becoming thermally super-critical. On the contrary B68 and L1517B
remained sub-critical; L1521F collapsed to become a VeLLO only when gas-cooling
was enhanced by increasing the size of dust-grains. This result is robust, for
other cores viz. B68, L694-2, L1517B and L1689 that previously remained
starless could also be similarly induced to collapse. Our principle conclusions
are : (a) acquiring the thermally super-critical state does not ensure that a
core will necessarily become protostellar, (b) potentially star-forming cores
(VeLLO L1521F here), could be experiencing coagulation of dust-grains that must
enhance the gas-dust coupling and in turn lower the gas temperature, thereby
assisting collapse. This hypothesis appears to have some observational support,
and (c) depending on its dynamic state at any given epoch, a core could appear
to be pressure-confined, gravitationally/virially bound, suggesting that
gravitational/virial boundedness of a core is insufficient to ensure it will
form stars, though it is crucial for gas in a contracting core to cool
efficiently so it can collapse further to become protostellar.

we demonstrated that the violent merger of a 1.1 and 0.9 M$_{\odot}$ white
dwarf binary system is too asymmetric to explain the low polarization levels
commonly observed in normal Type Ia supernovae. Here, we present polarization
simulations for two alternative scenarios: the sub-Chandrasekhar mass
double-detonation and the Chandrasekhar mass delayed-detonation model.
Specifically, we study a two-dimensional double-detonation model and a
three-dimensional delayed-detonation model, and calculate polarization spectra
for multiple observer orientations in both cases. We find modest polarization
levels ($<$ 1 per cent) for both explosion models. Polarization in the
continuum peaks at $\sim$ 0.1$-$0.3 per cent and decreases after maximum light,
in excellent agreement with spectropolarimetric data of normal Type Ia
supernovae. Higher degrees of polarization are found across individual spectral
lines. In particular, the synthetic Si ii {\lambda}6355 profiles are polarized
at levels that match remarkably well the values observed in normal Type Ia
supernovae, while the low degrees of polarization predicted across the O i
{\lambda}7774 region are consistent with the non-detection of this feature in
current data. We conclude that our models can reproduce many of the
characteristics of both flux and polarization spectra for well-studied Type Ia
supernovae, such as SN 2001el and SN 2012fr. However, the two models considered
here cannot account for the unusually high level of polarization observed in
extreme cases such as SN 2004dt.

graph structure compression, to the discovery of graph dynamics (e.g., node

asymmetric, real networks are highly symmetric. So a natural question is
whether preferential attachment graphs, where in each step a new node with $m$

preferential attachment graphs are symmetric for $m=1$, and there is some
non-negligible probability of symmetry for $m=2$. It was conjectured that these
graphs are asymmetric when $m \geq 3$. We settle this conjecture in the
affirmative, then use it to estimate the structural entropy of the model. To do
this, we also give bounds on the number of ways that the given graph structure
could have arisen by preferential attachment. These results have further
implications for information theoretic problems of interest on preferential

some interval in time and frequency. Modern interferometers are capable of
producing data at very high time and frequency resolution; practical limits on
storage and computation costs require that some form of data compression be
imposed. The traditional form of compression is a simple averaging of the
visibilities over coarser time and frequency bins. This has an undesired side
effect: the resulting averaged visibilities ""decorrelate"", and do so
differently depending on the baseline length and averaging interval. This
translates into a non-trivial signature in the image domain known as
""smearing"", which manifests itself as an attenuation in amplitude towards
off-centre sources. With the increasing fields of view and/or longer baselines
employed in modern and future instruments, the trade-off between data rate and
smearing becomes increasingly unfavourable. In this work we investigate
alternative approaches to low-loss data compression. We show that averaging of
the visibility data can be treated as a form of convolution by a boxcar-like
window function, and that by employing alternative baseline-dependent window
functions a more optimal interferometer smearing response may be induced. In
particular, we show improved amplitude response over a chosen field of
interest, and better attenuation of sources outside the field of interest. The
main cost of this technique is a reduction in nominal sensitivity; we
investigate the smearing vs. sensitivity trade-off, and show that in certain
regimes a favourable compromise can be achieved. We show the application of
this technique to simulated data from the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array (VLA)
and the European Very-long-baseline interferometry Network (EVN).

applications in control and optimization methods. In particular, many matrix
decompositions rely upon computation of eigenvalue-eigenvector pairs, such as
diagonal or Jordan normal forms. Unfortunately, numerical algorithms computing
eigenvectors are prone to errors. Due to uncomputability of eigenpairs,
perturbation theory and various regularization techniques only help if the
matrix at hand possesses certain properties such as the absence of non-zero
singular values, or the presence of a distinguishable gap between the large and
small singular values. Posing such a requirement might be restrictive in some
practical applications. In this note, we propose an alternative treatment of
eigenvectors which is approximate and constructive. In comparison to classical
eigenvectors whose computation is often prone to numerical instability, a

regenerating codes for an arbitrary sub-packetization level $\alpha$ for exact

sub-packetized because we provide an algorithm for constructing codes for any
$\alpha$ less than or equal to $r^{\lceil \frac{k}{r} \rceil}$ where
$\frac{k}{r}$ is not necessarily an integer. This leads to a flexible
construction of codes for different code rates compared to existing approaches.
We derive the lower and the upper bound of the repair bandwidth. The repair
bandwidth depends on the code parameters and $\alpha$. The repair process of a
failed systematic node is linear and highly parallelized, which means that a
set of $\lceil \frac{\alpha}{r} \rceil$ symbols is independently repaired first
and used along with the accessed data from other nodes to recover the remaining
symbols.

model, we establish a double inequality between the maximal $p$ for which
$L^p$-fixed point properties hold and the conformal dimension of the boundary.
  In the Gromov density model, we prove that for every $p_0 \in [2, \infty)$
for a sufficiently large number of generators and for any density larger than
1/3, a random group satisfies the fixed point property for affine actions on
$L^p$-spaces that are $(2-2\epsilon)^{1/2p}$-uniformly Lipschitz, and this for
every $p\in [2,p_0]$.
  To accomplish these goals we find new bounds on the first eigenvalue of the
p-Laplacian on random graphs, using methods adapted from Kahn and Szemeredi's
approach to the 2-Laplacian. These in turn lead to fixed point properties using
arguments of Bourdon and Gromov, which extend to $L^p$-spaces previous results
for Kazhdan's Property (T) established by Zuk and Ballmann-Swiatkowski.

Trojans is their bimodal color distribution. This bimodality is indicative of
two sub-populations within the Trojans, which have distinct size distributions.
In this paper, we present a simple, plausible hypothesis for the origin and
evolution of the two Trojan color sub-populations. In the framework of
dynamical instability models of early Solar System evolution, which suggest a
common primordial progenitor population for both Trojans and Kuiper belt
objects, we use observational constraints to assert that the color bimodalities
evident in both minor body populations developed within the primordial
population prior to the onset of instability. We show that, beginning with an
initial composition of rock and ices, location-dependent volatile loss through
sublimation in this primordial population could have led to sharp changes in
the surface composition with heliocentric distance. We propose that the
depletion or retention of H$_{2}$S ice on the surface of these objects was the
key factor in creating an initial color bimodality. Objects that retained
H$_{2}$S on their surfaces developed characteristically redder colors upon
irradiation than those that did not. After the bodies from the primordial
population were scattered and emplaced into their current positions, they
preserved this primordial color bimodality to the present day. We explore
predictions of the volatile loss model - in particular, the effect of
collisions within the Trojan population on the size distributions of the two
sub-populations - and propose further experimental and observational tests of
our hypothesis

reliable method to measure water surface velocity field in open channels and
rivers. LSPIV technique is based on a camera view that frames the water surface
in a sequence, and image-processing methods to compute water surface
displacements between consecutive frames. Using LSPIV, high flow velocities, as
for example flood conditions, were accurately measured, whereas determinations
of low flow velocities is more challenging, especially in absence of floating
seeding transported by the flow velocity. In fact, in unseeded conditions,
typical surface features dynamics must be taken into account: besides surface
structures convected by the current, capillary-gravity waves travel in all
directions, with their own dynamics. Discrimination between all these phenomena
is here discussed, providing a new method to distinguish and to correct
unseeded LSPIV measurements associated with wavy structures, accounting for
their phase speed magnitude and direction. This has been done measuring
wavenumber vectors by using the same images exploited for PIV analysis. All
measurements are performed without any flow seeding and in total absence of
suspended materials, using the specular reflection of the water surface as a
key marker. Results obtained at low-flow regimes in a straight concrete-made
rectangular-section channel and in a river are satisfying, especially if
compared to those obtained from classic LSPIV application without
discrimination and correction. Moreover, a novel simple and safe procedure to
orthorectify images is here presented.

introduced, and is characterized first for the case of fixed-set sampling.
Next, for independent random sampling performed without knowledge of the source
outputs, it is shown that the sampling rate distortion function is the same
regardless of whether or not the decoder is informed of the sequence of sampled
sets. Furthermore, memoryless random sampling is considered with the sampler
depending on the source outputs and with an informed decoder. It is shown that
deterministic sampling, characterized by a conditional point-mass, is optimal
and suffices to achieve the sampling rate distortion function. For memoryless
random sampling with an uninformed decoder, an upper bound for the sampling
rate distortion function is seen to possess a similar property of conditional
point-mass optimality. It is shown by example that memoryless sampling with an

that memoryless sampling can do strictly better with an informed decoder than

problem, the X-ray signals to be separated have similar morphological
characteristics, which brings previous source separation methods to their
limits. Our solution is to use photographs taken from the front and back-side
of the panel to drive the separation process. The crux of our approach relies
on the coupling of the two imaging modalities (photographs and X-rays) using a
novel coupled dictionary learning framework able to capture both common and
disparate features across the modalities using parsimonious representations;
the common component models features shared by the multi-modal images, whereas
the innovation component captures modality-specific information. As such, our
model enables the formulation of appropriately regularized convex optimization
procedures that lead to the accurate separation of the X-rays. Our dictionary
learning framework can be tailored both to a single- and a multi-scale
framework, with the latter leading to a significant performance improvement.
Moreover, to improve further on the visual quality of the separated images, we
propose to train coupled dictionaries that ignore certain parts of the painting
corresponding to craquelure. Experimentation on synthetic and real data - taken
from digital acquisition of the Ghent Altarpiece (1432) - confirms the
superiority of our method against the state-of-the-art morphological component
analysis technique that uses either fixed or trained dictionaries to perform
image separation.

single-item second-price auctions at once. As some items might be substitutes,
agents need to strategize in order to maximize their utilities. A number of
results indicate that high welfare can be achieved this way, giving bounds on
the welfare at equilibrium. Recently, however, criticism has been raised that
equilibria are hard to compute and therefore unlikely to be attained.
  In this paper, we take a different perspective. We study simple best-response
dynamics. That is, agents are activated one after the other and each activated
agent updates his strategy myopically to a best response against the other
agents' current strategies. Often these dynamics may take exponentially long
before they converge or they may not converge at all. However, as we show,
convergence is not even necessary for good welfare guarantees. Given that
agents' bid updates are aggressive enough but not too aggressive, the game will
remain in states of good welfare after each agent has updated his bid at least
once.
  In more detail, we show that if agents have fractionally subadditive
valuations, natural dynamics reach and remain in a state that provides a $1/3$
approximation to the optimal welfare after each agent has updated his bid at
least once. For subadditive valuations, we can guarantee an $\Omega(1/\log m)$
approximation in case of $m$ items that applies after each agent has updated
his bid at least once and at any point after that. The latter bound is
complemented by a negative result, showing that no kind of best-response
dynamics can guarantee more than an $o(\log \log m/\log m)$ fraction of the
optimal social welfare.

follows uncontrolled Ornstein-Uhlenbeck dynamics and affects the growth rate of

products becomes heterogenous, fads and fashions arise, and transitivity in
aggregate preferences is lost. Non-equilibrium path-dependent dynamics emerge,
the representative agent exhibits behavioural rules different than individual
agents, and aggregate utility cannot be optimised. Instead, an evolutionary

the biomass density as a function of logarithmic body mass is approximately
constant over many orders of magnitude. While size-spectrum models have
explained this phenomenon for assemblages of multicellular organisms, this
paper introduces a species-resolved size-spectrum model to explain the
phenomenon in unicellular plankton. A Sheldon spectrum spanning the cell-size
range of unicellular plankton necessarily consists of a large number of
coexisting species covering a wide range of characteristic sizes. The
coexistence of many phytoplankton species feeding on a small number of
resources is known as the Paradox of the Plankton. Our model resolves the
paradox by showing that coexistence is facilitated by the allometric scaling of
four physiological rates. Two of the allometries have empirical support, the
remaining two emerge from predator-prey interactions exactly when the
abundances follow a Sheldon spectrum. Our plankton model is a scale-invariant
trait-based size-spectrum model: it describes the abundance of phyto- and
zooplankton cells as a function of both size and species trait (the maximal
size before cell division). It incorporates growth due to resource consumption
and predation on smaller cells, death due to predation, and a flexible cell
division process. We give analytic solutions at steady state for both the
within-species size distributions and the relative abundances across species.

expected to correspond to the angle-averaged quasi-stationary distribution

compare the prediction of the quasilinear theory to direct numerical

that the quasilinear theory works reasonably well for weakly unstable initial
conditions and that it is able to predict the energy marking the
out-of-equilibrium phase transition between unmagnetized and magnetized
quasi-stationary states. At energies lower than the out-of-equilibrium
transition the quasilinear theory works less well, the disagreement with the
numerical simulations increasing by decreasing the energy. In that case, we
observe, in agreement with our previous numerical study [A. Campa and P.-H.
Chavanis, Eur. Phys. J. B 86, 170 (2013)], that the quasi-stationary states are
remarkably well fitted by polytropic distributions (Tsallis distributions) with

these polytropic distributions are able to account for the region of negative
specific heats in the out-of-equilibrium caloric curve, unlike the Boltzmann

medical imaging, such as being globally optimizable, allowing user interaction,
and providing uncertainty information. The RW algorithm defines a weighted
graph over an image and uses the graph's Laplacian matrix to regularize its
solutions. This regularization reduces to solving a large system of equations,
which may be excessively time consuming in some applications, such as when
interacting with a human user. Techniques have been developed that precompute
eigenvectors of a Laplacian offline, after image acquisition but before any
analysis, in order speed up the RW algorithm online, when segmentation or
registration is being performed. However, precomputation requires certain
algorithm parameters be fixed offline, limiting their flexibility. In this
paper, we develop techniques to update the precomputed data online when RW
parameters are altered. Specifically, we dynamically determine the number of
eigenvectors needed for a desired accuracy based on user input, and derive
update equations for the eigenvectors when the edge weights or topology of the

The code employs a high-order, finite-volume method for mapped coordinates with
extensions for nonlinear hyperbolic conservation laws. Apsara can handle
arbitrary structured curvilinear meshes in three spatial dimensions. The code
has successfully passed several hydrodynamic test problems, including the
advection of a Gaussian density profile and a nonlinear vortex and the
propagation of linear acoustic waves. For these test problems, Apsara produces
fourth-order accurate results in case of smooth grid mappings. The order of
accuracy is reduced to first-order when using the nonsmooth circular grid
mapping. When applying the high-order method to simulations of low-Mach number
flows, for example, the Gresho vortex and the Taylor-Green vortex, we discover
that Apsara delivers superior results to codes based on the dimensionally
split, piecewise parabolic method (PPM) widely used in astrophysics. Hence,
Apsara is a suitable tool for simulating highly subsonic flows in astrophysics.
In the first astrophysical application, we perform implicit large eddy

propose a general equation of state for unitary Fermi gases. The universal
equation of state is written as a series solution to a self consistent integral
equation where the general solution is a linear combination of Fermi functions.
First, by truncating our series solution to four terms with already known exact
theoretical inputs at limiting cases, namely the first \emph{three} virial
coefficients and using the Bertsch parameter as a free parameter, we find a
good agreement with experimental measurements in the entire temperature region
in the normal state. This analytical equation of state agrees with experimental
data up to the fugacity $z = 18$, which is a vast improvement over the other
analytical equations of state available where the agreements is \emph{only} up
to $z \approx 7$. Second, by truncating our series solution to four terms again
using first \emph{four} virial coefficients, we find the Bertsch parameter $\xi
=0.35$, which is in good agreement with the direct experimental measurement of
$\xi =0.37$. This second form of equation of state shows a good agreement with
self-consistent T-matrix calculations in the normal phase.

  Oxford), july 2016",,,"q-fin.EC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Given that Olympic Games held over the past decade each have cost USD 8.9
billion on average, the size and financial risks of the Games warrant study.
The objectives of the Oxford Olympics study are to (1) establish the actual
outturn costs of previous Olympic Games in a manner where cost can consistently
be compared across Games; (2) establish cost overruns for previous Games, i.e.,
the degree to which final outturn costs reflect projected budgets at the bid
stage, again in a way that allows comparison across Games; (3) test whether the
Olympic Games Knowledge Management Program has reduced cost risk for the Games,
and, finally, (4) benchmark cost and cost overrun for the Rio 2016 Olympics
against previous Games. The main contribution of the Oxford study is to
establish a phenomenology of cost and cost overrun at the Olympics, which
allows consistent and systematic comparison across Games. This has not been
done before. The study concludes that for a city and nation to decide to stage
the Olympic Games is to decide to take on one of the most costly and
financially most risky type of megaproject that exists, something that many
cities and nations have learned to their peril.

equation can be superposed nonlinearly via the Darboux transformation to yield
breathers of higher order. Surprisingly, we find that the peak height of each
Akhmediev breather only adds {\it linearly} to form the peak height of the
final breather. Using this new peak-height formula, we show that at any given
periodicity, there exist a unique high-order breather of maximal intensity.
Moreover, these high-order breathers form a continuous hierarchy, growing in
intensity with increasing periodicity. For any such higher-order breather, a
simple initial wave function can be extracted from the Darboux transformation
to dynamically generate that breather from the nonlinear Schrodinger equation.

dynamics. Additionally, the fluctuations of time-integrated currents are
investigated. In analogy with the KPZ equation, their typical fluctuations
should be of size $t^{1/3}$ and have a Tracy-Widom GUE distributed amplitude.
The proper extension to anharmonic chains is explained and tested through
molecular dynamics. Our results are calibrated against the stochastic LeRoux

(HEGBs) of cubic (3C) silicon carbide (SiC) is studied using an ab initio based
kinetic Monte Carlo (kMC) model. This study assesses the hypothesis that the
HEGB diffusion is responsible for Ag release in Tristructural-Isotropic fuel
particles, and provides a specific example to increase understanding of
impurity diffusion in highly disordered grain boundaries. The HEGB environment
was modeled by an amorphous SiC. The structure and stability of Ag defects were
calculated using density functional theory code. The defect energetics
suggested that the fastest diffusion takes place via an interstitial mechanism
in a-SiC. The formation energy of Ag interstitials and the kinetic resolved
activation energies between them were well approximated with Gaussian
distributions that were then sampled in the kMC. The diffusion of Ag was
simulated with the effective medium model using kMC. At 1200-1600C, Ag in a
HEGB is predicted to exhibit an Arrhenius type diffusion and with a diffusion
prefactor and effective activation energy of (2.73+-1.09)*10-10 m2s-1 and
2.79+-0.18 eV, respectively. The comparison between HEGB results to other
theoretical studies suggested not only that GB diffusion is predominant over
bulk diffusion, but also that the HEGB is one of fastest grain boundary paths
for Ag diffusion in SiC. The Ag diffusion coefficient in the HEGB shows a good
agreement with ion-implantation measurements, but is 2-3 orders of magnitude
lower than the diffusion coefficients extracted from integral release
measurements. The discrepancy between GB diffusion and integral release
measurements suggests that other contributions are responsible for the fast
release of Ag in some experiments and we propose that these contributions may
arise from radiation enhanced diffusion.
