curve if its position vector field always lies in its rectifying plane. This
notion of rectifying curves was introduced by the author in [Amer. Math.
Monthly {\bf 110} (2003), no. 2, 147-152]. In this present article, we
introduce and study the notion of rectifying submanifolds in Euclidean spaces.
In particular, we prove that a Euclidean submanifold is rectifying if and only
if the tangential component of its position vector field is a concurrent vector
field. Moreover, rectifying submanifolds with arbitrary codimension are
completely determined.

generalized uncertainty principle are examined. Studies of this principle are
motivated by the existence of a minimal observable length. Then the position
and momentum operators satisfy the modified commutation relation, for which
more than one algebraic representation is known. One of them is described by
auxiliary momentum so that the momentum and coordinate wave functions are
connected by the Fourier transform. However, the probability density functions
of the physically true and auxiliary momenta are different. As the
corresponding entropies differ, known entropic uncertainty relations are
changed. Using differential Shannon entropies, we give a state-dependent
formulation with correction term. State-independent uncertainty relations are
obtained in terms of the R\'{e}nyi entropies and the Tsallis entropies with
binning. Such relations allow one to take into account a finiteness of
measurement resolution.

affect the CP phase measurement mainly come from the violation of vacuum
mimicking as well as from the corrections to the 1-3 mixing angle and
mass-squared difference. We find that the total NSI correction to the $\nu_\mu

T2(H)K. Correspondingly, the correction to the CP phase can be as large as
$50^\circ$ and hence significantly deteriorates the CP sensitivity at T2(H)K.

measure the oscillation of the antineutrinos from muon decay at rest

work deals with the synchronization phenomenon, that could be roughly defined
as the tendency of different components to adopt a common behavior. We continue
the study of a model of interacting stochastic processes with reinforcement,
that recently has been introduced in Crimaldi et al. (2016, arXiv:1602.06217).
Generally speaking, by reinforcement we mean any mechanism for which the
probability that a given event occurs has an increasing dependence on the
number of times that events of the same type occurred in the past. The
particularity of systems of such stochastic processes is that synchronization
is induced along time by the reinforcement mechanism itself and does not
require a large-scale limit. We focus on the relationship between the topology
of the network of the interactions and the long-time synchronization
phenomenon. After proving the almost sure synchronization, we provide some CLTs
in the sense of stable convergence that establish the convergence rates and the
asymptotic distributions for both convergence to the common limit and
synchronization. The obtained results lead to the construction of asymptotic
confidence intervals for the limit random variable and of statistical tests to
make inference on the topology of the network given the observation of the
reinforced stochastic processes positioned at the vertices.

secluded DM scenario, in which the $d$ number decreasing process dominantly
occurs not through the pair annihilation of $d$ into the standard model
particles, but via the $dd \to mm$ scattering process with a subsequently
decaying mediator particle $m$. It is pointed out that the cosmologically
observed relic abundance of DM can be accomplished even with a massive mediator
having a mass $m_m$ non-negligibly heavy compared with the DM particle mass
$m_d$. In the degenerated $d$-$m$ case ($m_d=m_m$), the DM relic abundance is
realized by adjusting the $dd \to mm$ scattering amplitude large enough and by
choosing an appropriate mediator particle life-time. The DM evolution in the
early universe exhibits characteristic ""terrace"" behavior, or two-step number
density decreasing behavior, having a ""fake"" freeze-out at the first step.
Based on these observations, a novel possibility of the DM model buildings is
introduced in which the mediator particle $m$ is unified with the DM particle
$d$ in an approximate dark symmetry multiplet. A pionic DM model is proposed to
illustrate this idea in a renormalizable field theory framework.

in the basic (actually, simplest) model which is capable to produce the SSB
phenomenology in the one-dimensional setting. It is based on the
Gross-Pitaevskii - nonlinear Schroedinger equation with the cubic
self-attractive term and a double-well-potential built as an infinitely deep
potential box split by a narrow (delta-functional) barrier. The barrier's
strength, epsilon, is the single free parameter of the scaled form of the
model. It may be implemented in atomic Bose-Einstein condensates and nonlinear
optics. The SSB bifurcation of the symmetric ground state (GS) is predicted
analytically in two limit cases, viz., for deep or weak splitting of the
potential box by the barrier. For the generic case, a variational approximation
(VA) is elaborated. The analytical findings are presented along with systematic
numerical results. Stability of stationary states is studied through the
calculation of eigenvalues for small perturbations, and by means of direct
simulations. The GS always undergoes the SSB bifurcation of the supercritical
type, as predicted by the VA at moderate values of epsilon, although the VA
fails at small epsilon, due to inapplicability of the underlying ansatz in that
case. However, the latter case is correctly treated by the approximation based
on a soliton ansatz. On top of the GS, the first and second excited states are
studied too. The antisymmetric mode (the first excited state) is destabilized
at a critical value of its norm. The second excited state undergoes the SSB
bifurcation, like the GS, but, unlike it, the bifurcation produces an unstable
asymmetric mode. All unstable modes tend to spontaneously reshape into the
asymmetric GS.

turning points where the derivative of the Hubble parameter $H$ changes sign
and of a bounce point where the Hubble parameter vanishes. We find the
conditions for $K(X)$ and the potential which ensure the above requirements. We
then give the examples of two models constructed according to these conditions.
One is based on a quadratic $K(X)$, and the other a $K(X)$ which is avoiding
divergences of the second time derivative of the scalar field, which may
otherwise occur. An appropriate choice of the initial conditions can lead to a
sequence of consecutive bounces, or oscillations of $H$. In the region where
these models have a constant potential they are adiabatic on any scale and
because of this they may not conserve curvature perturbations on super-horizon
scales. While at the perturbation level one class of models is free from ghosts
and singularities of the classical equations of motion, in general gradient
instabilities are present around the bounce time, because the sign of the
squared speed of sound is opposite to the sign of the time derivative of $H$.
We discuss how this kind of instabilities could be avoided by modifying the
Lagrangian by introducing Galileion terms in order to prevent a negative
squared speed of sound around the bounce.

sources of 3-photon entangled states (and may simplify further). Given such
sources, each photon need pass through a small, constant, number of components,
interfering with at most 2 other spatially nearby photons, and current
photonics engineering has already demonstrated the manufacture of thousands of
components on two-dimensional semiconductor chips with performance that allows
the creation of tens of thousands of photons entangled in a state universal for
quantum computation.
  At present the fully-integrated, silicon-photonic architecture we envisage
involves creating the required entangled states by starting with single-photons
produced non-determistically by pumping silicon waveguides (or cavities)
combined with on-chip filters and nanowire superconducting detectors to herald
that a photon has been produced. These sources are multiplexed into being
near-deterministic, and the single photons then passed through an
interferometer to non-deterministically produce small entangled states -
necessarily multiplexed to near-determinism again. This is followed by a
`ballistic' scattering of the small-scale entangled photons through an
interferometer such that some photons are detected, leaving the remainder in a
large-scale entangled state which is provably universal for quantum computing
implemented by single-photon measurements.
  There are a large number of questions regarding the optimum ways to make and
use the final cluster state, dealing with static imperfections, constructing
the initial entangled photon sources and so on, that need to be investigated
before we can aim for millions of qubits capable of billions of computational
time-steps. The focus in this article is on the theoretical side of such
questions.

method, which is used to extract the stellar and gas kinematics, as well as the
stellar population of galaxies, via full spectrum fitting. I then focus on the
problem of extracting the kinematic when the velocity dispersion $\sigma$ is
smaller than the velocity sampling $\Delta V$, which is generally, by design,
close to the instrumental dispersion $\sigma_{\rm inst}$. The standard approach
consists of convolving templates with a discretized kernel, while fitting for
its parameters. This is obviously very inaccurate when $\sigma<\Delta V/2$, due
to undersampling. Oversampling can prevent this, but it has drawbacks. Here I
present a more accurate and efficient alternative. It avoids the evaluation of
the under-sampled kernel, and instead directly computes its well-sampled
analytic Fourier transform, for use with the convolution theorem. A simple
analytic transform exists when the kernel is described by the popular
Gauss-Hermite parametrization (which includes the Gaussian as special case) for
the line-of-sight velocity distribution. I describe how this idea was
implemented in a significant upgrade to the publicly available pPXF software.
The key advantage of the new approach is that it provides accurate velocities
regardless of $\sigma$. This is important e.g. for spectroscopic surveys
targeting galaxies with $\sigma\ll\sigma_{\rm inst}$, for galaxy redshift
determinations, or for measuring line-of-sight velocities of individual stars.
The proposed method could also be used to fix Gaussian convolution algorithms
used in today's popular software packages.

modulates the propensity of neurons to fire. Synchronous activation of neurons
has been hypothesized to be a separate channel of signal processing information
in the brain. A salient question is therefore if and how oscillations interact
with spike synchrony and in how far these channels can be considered separate.
Experiments indeed showed that correlated spiking co-modulates with the static
firing rate and is also tightly locked to the phase of beta-oscillations. While
the dependence of correlations on the mean rate is well understood in
feed-forward networks, it remains unclear why and by which mechanisms
correlations tightly lock to an oscillatory cycle. We here demonstrate that
such correlated activation of pairs of neurons is qualitatively explained by
periodically-driven random networks. We identify the mechanisms by which
covariances depend on a driving periodic stimulus. Mean-field theory combined
with linear response theory yields closed-form expressions for the
cyclostationary mean activities and pairwise zero-time-lag covariances of
binary recurrent random networks. Two distinct mechanisms cause time-dependent
covariances: the modulation of the susceptibility of single neurons (via the
external input and network feedback) and the time-varying variances of single
unit activities. For some parameters, the effectively inhibitory recurrent
feedback leads to resonant covariances even if mean activities show
non-resonant behavior. Our analytical results open the question of
time-modulated synchronous activity to a quantitative analysis.

probabilistic terms without making assumptions about the background knowledge
of data intruders, and thus provides a robust concept for privacy protection.
Practical applications of DP involve development of differentially private
mechanisms to generate sanitized results at a pre-specified privacy budget. For
the sanitization of statistics with publicly known bounds such as proportions
and correlation coefficients, the bounding constraints will need to be
incorporated in the differentially private mechanisms. There has been little
work on examining the consequences of the bounding constraints on the accuracy
of sanitized results and the statistical inferences of the population
parameters based on the sanitized results. In this paper, we formalize the
differentially private truncated and boundary inflated truncated (BIT)
procedures for releasing statistics with publicly known bounding constraints.
The impacts of the truncated and BIT Laplace procedures on the statistical
accuracy and validity of sanitized statistics are evaluated both theoretically
and empirically via simulation studies.

using the non-perturbative concentric Maclaurin Spheroid (CMS) method that
eliminates lengthy expansions used in the theory of figures. Our method
captures terms arising from the coupled tidal and rotational perturbations,
which we find to be important for a rapidly-rotating planet like Jupiter. Our
predicted static tidal Love number $k_2 = 0.5900$ is $\sim$10\% larger than
previous estimates. The value is, as expected, highly correlated with the zonal
harmonic coefficient $J_2$, and is thus nearly constant when plausible changes
are made to interior structure while holding $J_2$ fixed at the observed value.
We note that the predicted static $k_2$ might change due to Jupiter's dynamical
response to the Galilean moons, and find reasons to argue that the change may
be detectable, although we do not present here a theory of dynamical tides for
highly oblate Jovian planets. An accurate model of Jupiter's tidal response
will be essential for interpreting Juno observations and identifying tidal
signals from effects of other interior dynamics in Jupiter's gravitational

mode-by-mode using a 3-dimensional extension of the frequency domain, perfectly

interdiffusion are found to increase the number of available modes for
transmission, consistent qualitatively with the DMM, we do not find
quantitative or qualitative convergence toward the DMM at higher levels of

DMM, modes are not found to lose memory of their initial polarization and
wavevector. The transmission coefficients of randomly interdiffused and

carriers are doped into a Mott insulating parent compound. An unresolved puzzle
is the unconventional nature of the normal state above the superconducting
dome, and its connection to the superconducting instability. At weak
hole-doping, a ""pseudo-gap"" metal state with signatures of time-reversal
symmetry breaking is observed, which near optimal doping changes into a
""strange metal"" with non-Fermi liquid properties. Qualitatively similar phase
diagrams are found in multi-orbital systems, such as pnictides, where the
unconventional metal states arise from a Hund coupling induced spin-freezing.
Here, we show that the relevant model for cuprates, the single-orbital Hubbard
model on the square lattice, can be mapped onto an effective multi-orbital
problem with strong ferromagnetic Hund coupling. The spin-freezing physics of
this multi-orbital system explains the phenomenology of cuprates, including the
pseudo-gap, the strange metal, and the d-wave superconducting instability. Our
analysis suggests that spin-freezing is the universal mechanism which controls
the properties of unconventional superconductors.

On this boundary, a scalar unknown (buoyancy or surface temperature of the
fluid) satisfies the surface quasi-geostrophic equation. The feedback nudging
is done on this two-dimensional model, yet ultimately synchronizes the
streamfunction of the three-dimensional flow. The main analytical difficulties
are due to the presence of a nonlocal dissipative operator in the surface
quasi-geostrophic equation. This is overcome by exploiting a suitable partition
of unity, the modulus of continuity characterization of Sobolev space norms,
and the Littlewood-Paley decomposition to ultimately establish various

actuation capabilities to monitor and control operations in the physical
environment. A key requirement of such systems is the need to provide
predictable real-time performance: the timing correctness of the system should
be analyzable at design time with a quantitative metric and guaranteed at
runtime with high assurance. This requirement of predictability is particularly
important for safety-critical domains such as automobiles, aerospace, defense,
manufacturing and medical devices.
  The work in this dissertation focuses on the challenges arising from the use
of modern multi-core platforms in CPS. Even as of today, multi-core platforms
are rarely used in safety-critical applications primarily due to the temporal
interference caused by contention on various resources shared among processor
cores, such as caches, memory buses, and I/O devices. Such interference is hard
to predict and can significantly increase task execution time, e.g., up to 12x
on commodity quad-core platforms. To address the problem of ensuring timing
predictability on multi-core platforms, we develop novel analytical and systems
techniques in this dissertation. Our proposed techniques theoretically bound
temporal interference that tasks may suffer from when accessing shared
resources. Our techniques also involve software primitives and algorithms for
real-time operating systems and hypervisors, which significantly reduce the
degree of the temporal interference. Specifically, we tackle the issues of
cache and memory contention, locking and synchronization, interrupt handling,
and access control for computational accelerators such as GPGPUs, all of which
are crucial to achieving predictable real-time performance on a modern
multi-core platform.

for solving multi-term fractional differential equations with arbitrarily many

the Extended Connectionist Temporal Classification (ECTC) framework to
efficiently evaluate all possible alignments via dynamic programming and
explicitly enforce their consistency with frame-to-frame visual similarities.
This protects the model from distractions of visually inconsistent or
degenerated alignments without the need of temporal supervision. We further
extend our framework to the semi-supervised case when a few frames are sparsely
annotated in a video. With less than 1% of labeled frames per video, our method
is able to outperform existing semi-supervised approaches and achieve
comparable performance to that of fully supervised approaches.

expansion in powers of $R/a$, with $R$ the range of the nuclear force and $a$
the nucleon-nucleon ($N\!N$) scattering lengths. In the Wigner-SU(4) limit, the
triton and Helium-3 point charge radii are equal. At NLO in the range expansion
both are $1.66$ fm. Adding the first-order corrections due to the breaking of
Wigner symmetry in the $N\!N$ scattering lengths gives a ${}^3\mathrm{H}$ point
charge radius of $1.58$ fm, which is remarkably close to the experimental

from the wavefront sensing system allows the possibility of self-consistently
determining the optical aberrations (the cause of quasi-static speckles) and
the planetary image. This approach may be especially advantageous for finding
planets within about 3 $\lambda / D$ of the star where differential imaging is
ineffective. As shown in a recent article by the author (J. Opt. Soc. Am. A.,
33, 712, 2016), one must account for unknown aberrations in several
non-conjugate planes of the optical system, which, in turn, requires ability to
computational propagate the field between these planes. These computations are
likely to be difficult to implement and expensive. Here, a far more convenient
alternative based on empirical Green's functions is provided. It is shown that
the empirical Green's function (EGF), which accounts for all multi-planar,
non-common path aberrations, and results in a much more tractable and highly
parallel computational problem. It is also shown that the EGF can be
generalized to treat polarization, resulting in the empirical Green's tensor

The gamma quanta originating from o-Ps decay interact in the plastic

reflectance curves measured in a modified Kretschmann arrangement and computed
numerically proved that monitoring the narrower secondary peaks under optimal

sensitivity in biodetection. The enlarged resonance peak shift is due to the
horizontally and vertically antisymmetric long-range plamonic modes propagating
at the edge of the valleys and hills, which originate from Bragg scattered
surface plasmon polaritons. The sensitivity is further increased in case of
bioconjugates due to the coupled localized resonances on Au NPs.

the Parkes HI Zone of Avoidance (HIZOA) survey, which forms the basis for an
investigation of the matter distribution in the Zone of Avoidance. Observations
were conducted between 2006 and 2013 using the Infrared Survey Facility (IRSF),
a 1.4-m telescope situated at the South African Astronomical Observatory site
in Sutherland. The images cover all 1108 HIZOA detections and yield 915
galaxies. An additional 105 bright 2MASS galaxies in the southern ZOA were
imaged with the IRSF, resulting in 129 galaxies. The average $K_s$-band seeing
and sky background for the survey are 1.38 arcsec and 20.1 mag, respectively.
The detection rate as a function of stellar density and dust extinction is
found to depend mainly on the HI mass of the HI detected galaxies, which in
principal correlates with the NIR brightness of the spiral galaxies. The
measured isophotal magnitudes are of sufficient accuracy (errors $\sim$ 0.02
mag) to be used in a Tully-Fisher analysis. In the final NIR catalogue, 285
galaxies have both IRSF and 2MASS photometry (180 HIZOA plus 105 bright 2MASX
galaxies). The $K_s$-band isophotal magnitudes presented in this paper agree,
within the uncertainties, with those reported in the 2MASX catalogue. Another
30 galaxies, from the HIZOA northern extension, are also covered by UKIDSS
Galactic Plane Survey (GPS) images, which are one magnitude deeper than our
IRSF images. A modified version of our photometry pipeline was used to derive
the photometric parameters of these UKIDSS galaxies. Good agreement was found
between the respective $K_s$-band isophotal magnitudes. These comparisons
confirm the robustness of the isophotal parameters and demonstrate that the
IRSF images do not suffer from foreground contamination, after star removal,
nor under-estimate the isophotal fluxes of ZoA galaxies.

principal component analysis to define the dissimilarity measure to be used for
agglomerative hierarchical clustering. To evaluate the performance of this

Girvan-Newman, Fastgreedy, Walktrap and Infomap using two types of synthetic

a set of science requirements on the precision of estimates of the following

background for a high-resolution cosmological simulation of a Milky Way-like
galaxy and examine the effect on the absorption and emission properties of
metals in the CGM. We find that a reduced quasar background brings the column
density predictions into better agreement with recent data. Similarly, when the
observationally derived physical properties of the gas are compared to the
simulation, we find that the simulation gas is always at temperatures
approximately 0.5 dex higher. Thus, similar column densities can be produced
from fundamentally different gas. However, emission maps can provide
complementary information to the line-of-sight column densities to better
derive gas properties. From the simulations, we find that the brightest
emission is less sensitive to the extragalactic background and that it closely
follows the fundamental filamentary structure of the halo. This becomes
increasingly true as the galaxy evolves from z=1 to z=0 and the majority of the
gas transitions to a hotter, more diffuse phase. For the brightest ions (CIII,
CIV, OVI), detectable emission can extend as far as 120 kpc at z=0. Finally,
resolution is a limiting factor for the conclusions we can draw from emission
observations but with moderate resolution and reasonable detection limits,
upcoming instrumentation should place constraints on the physical properties of

Hubbard model on the Lieb lattice from weak to strong interaction by means of
the mean-field approximation. To validate the method we employed, we first
discuss the SU($2$) Hubbard model at the mean-field level, and find that our
results are consistent with known rigorous theorems. We then extend the
calculation to the case of SU($3$) symmetry. We find that, at $4/9$ filling,
the SU$(3)$ symmetry spontaneously breaks into the SU$(2)\times$U$(1)$ symmetry
in the ground state, leading to a staggered ferromagnetic state for any
repulsive $U$ at zero temperature. We then investigate the stability of the
ferromagnetic state by relaxing the filling away from $4/9$, and conclude that
the ferromagnetic state is sensitive but robust to fillings, as it can persist
within a certain filling regime. We also apply the mean-field approximation to
finite temperature to calculate the critical temperature and the critical
entropy of the ferromagnetic state. As the resulting critical entropy per
particle is significantly greater than that can be realized in experiments, we
expect some quasi-long-range-ordered features of such a ferromagnetic state can
be realized and observed with fermionic alkaline-earth-metal(-like) atoms

MaNGA will permit exploration of the internal structure of a statistically
large sample of 10,000 low redshift galaxies in unprecedented detail.
Comprising 174 individually pluggable science and calibration IFUs with a
near-constant data stream, MaNGA is expected to obtain ~ 100 million raw-frame

the survey. In this contribution, we describe the MaNGA Data Reduction Pipeline

designed to analyse the radial surface brightness profiles of galaxies. With an
intuitive graphical user interface, $Profiler$ can accurately model a wide
range of galaxies and galaxy components, such as elliptical galaxies, the
bulges of spiral and lenticular galaxies, nuclear sources, discs, bars, rings,
spiral arms, etc., with a variety of parametric functions routinely employed in
the field (S\'ersic, core-S\'ersic, exponential, Gaussian, Moffat and Ferrers).
In addition to these, $Profiler$ can employ the broken exponential model
(relevant for disc truncations or antitruncations) and two special cases of the
edge-on disc model: namely along the major axis (in the disc plane) and along
the minor axis (perpendicular to the disc plane). $Profiler$ is optimised to
work with galaxy light profiles obtained from isophotal measurements which
capture radial gradients in the ellipticity, position angle and Fourier
harmonic profiles of the isophotes, and are thus often better at capturing the
total light than two-dimensional image-fitting programs. Additionally, the
one-dimensional approach is generally less computationally expensive and more
stable. In $Profiler$, the convolution of either circular or elliptical models
with the point spread function is performed in two-dimensions, and offers a
choice between Gaussian, Moffat or a user-provided data vector (a table of
intensity values as a function of radius) for the point spread function. I
demonstrate $Profiler$'s features and operation by decomposing three case-study
galaxies: the cored elliptical galaxy NGC 3348, the nucleated dwarf Seyfert I
galaxy Pox 52, and NGC 2549, a structurally complex, double-barred galaxy which
also displays a Type II truncated disc viewed edge-on. $Profiler$ is freely

dramatic increase in their viscosity as the temperature ($T$) is lowered. This
precipitous rise has long posed a fundamental theoretical challenge. Numerous
approaches currently attempt to explain this phenomenon. When present, data
collapse points to an underlying simplicity in various branches of science. In
this Letter, we report on a 16 decade data collapse of the viscosity of 45
different liquids of all known types. Specifically, the viscosity of
supercooled liquids scaled by their value at their respective equilibrium
melting temperature ($\eta(T)/\eta(T_{melt}))$ is, for all temperatures
$T<T_{melt}$, a universal function of $(T_{melt} - T)/(B T)$ where $B$ is a
constant that does not change significantly from one liquid to another. This
exceptionally plain behavior hints at a link between glassy dynamics and the

leading mechanism to explain large eccentricities of gas giant exoplanets is
planet-planet gravitational scattering. The same scattering has been invoked to
explain misalignments of planetary orbital planes with respect to their host
star's spin. However, an observational puzzle is presented by Kepler-56, which
has two inner planets (b and c) that are nearly coplanar with each other, yet
are more than 45 degrees inclined to their star's equator. Thus the spin-orbit
misalignment might be primordial. Instead, we further develop the hypothesis in
the discovery paper, that planets on wider orbits generated misalignment
through scattering, and as a result gently torqued the inner planets away from
the equator plane of the star. We integrated the equations of motion for
Kepler-56 b and c along with an unstable outer system initialized with either
two or three Jupiter-mass planets. We address here whether the violent
scattering that generates large mutual inclinations can leave the inner system
intact, tilting it gently. In almost all of the cases initially with two outer
planets, either the inner planets remain nearly coplanar with each other in the
star's equator plane, or they are scattered violently to high mutual
inclination and high spin-orbit misalignment. On the contrary, of the systems
with three unstable outer planets, a spin-orbit misalignment large enough to
explain the observations is generated 28% of the time for coplanar inner
planets, which is consistent with the observed frequency of this phenomenon
reported so far. We conclude that multiple-planet scattering in the outer parts
of the system may account for this new population of coplanar planets hosted by
oblique stars.

consideration of temperature dependent band gap. The change in used value of

clustering and provides insights into how high-level connectivity emerges.

distinguishing between structural universality classes of disordered systems in

by NMR methods over three orders of magnitude in time. The relation between the
structural exponent, characterizing disorder universality class, and the
dynamical exponent of the diffusion coefficient is experimentally verified. The
experimentally established relation between structure and transport exemplifies
the hierarchical nature of structural complexity --- dynamics are mainly
determined by the universality class, whereas microscopic parameters affect the
non-universal coefficients. These results open the way for non-invasive
characterization of structural correlations in porous media, complex materials,
and biological tissues via a bulk diffusion measurement.

properties, we present an analysis of different characteristics of spiral
galaxies with strong, weak and without bars. Method: We identified barred
galaxies from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. By visual inspection, we classified
the face-on spiral galaxies brighter than g<16.5 mag into strong-bar, weak-bar
and unbarred. In order to provide an appropiate quantification of the influence
of bars on galaxy properties, we also constructed a suitable control sample of
unbarred galaxies with similar redshift, magnitude, morphology, bulge sizes,
and local density environment distributions to that of barred galaxies.
Results: We found 522 strong-barred and 770 weak-barred galaxies, representing
a 25.82% of the full sample of spiral galaxies, in good agreement with previous
studies. We also found that strong-barred galaxies show less efficient star
formation activity and older stellar populations compared to weak-barred and
unbarred spirals from the control sample. In addition, there is a significant
excess of strong barred galaxies with red colors. The color-color and
color-magnitude diagrams show that unbarred and weak-barred galaxies are more
extended towards the blue zone, while strong-barred objects are mostly grouped
in the red region. Strong-barred galaxies present an important excess of high
metallicity values, compared to the other types, showing similar 12+log(O/H)
distributions. Regarding the mass-metallicity relation, we found that
weak-barred and unbarred galaxies are fitted by similar curves, while
strong-barred ones show a curve which falls abruptly, with more significance in
the range of low stellar masses (log[Mstar/Msun] < 10.0). These results would
indicate that prominent bars produced an accelerating effect on the gas
processing, reflected in the significant changes in the physical properties of
their host.

received significant attention in the past years, not only due to their well
known theoretical guarantees, but also because of practical computational
advantages. However, to tackle more challenging tasks and scenarios such as
locomotion on uneven terrain, a more expressive model is required. In this
paper, we are interested in contact interaction-centered motion optimization
based on the momentum dynamics model. This model is non-linear and non-convex;
however, we find a relaxation of the problem that allows us to formulate it as
a single convex quadratically-constrained quadratic program (QCQP) that can be
very efficiently optimized. Furthermore, experimental results suggest that this
relaxation is tight and therefore useful for multi-contact planning. This
convex model is then coupled to the optimization of end-effector contacts
location using a mixed integer program, which can be solved in realtime. This
becomes relevant e.g. to recover from external pushes, where a predefined
stepping plan is likely to fail and an online adaptation of the contact
location is needed. The performance of our algorithm is demonstrated in several
multi-contact scenarios for humanoid robot.

classical T Tauri star jets have been detected with the HST in optical and
near-ultraviolet (NUV) emission lines, and these Doppler shifts were
interpreted as rotation signatures under the assumption of steady state flow.
To support this interpretation, it is necessary that the underlying disks
rotate in the same sense. Agreement between disk rotation and jet rotation
determined from optical lines has been verified in two cases and rejected in
one case. Meanwhile, the NUV lines, which may trace faster and more collimated
inner spines of the jet than optical lines, either agree or show no clear
indication. We propose to perform this test on the fourth system, Th 28. We
present ALMA high angular resolution Band 7 continuum, 12CO(3-2) and 13CO(2-1)
observations of the circumstellar disk around the T Tauri star Th 28. We were
able to detect, in CO and continuum, clear signatures of a disk in Keplerian
rotation around Th28. The 12CO emission is resolved, allowing us to derive
estimates of disk position angle and inclination. The large velocity separation
of the peaks in 12CO, combined with the resolved extent of the emission,
indicate a central stellar mass in the range 1-2 Msun. The rotation sense of
the disk is well detected in both 13CO and 12CO emission lines, and this
direction is opposite to that implied by the transverse Doppler shifts measured
in the optical lines of the jet. The Th 28 system is the second system where
counter-rotation between the disk and the optical jet is detected. These
findings imply either that optical transverse velocity gradients detected with
HST do not trace jet rotation or that modeling the flow with the steady
assumption is not valid. In both cases jet rotation studies that rely solely on
optical lines are not suitable to derive the launching radius of the jet.

measurements show that Gd$_2$Pt$_2$O$_7$ undergoes an antiferromagnetic
ordering transition at $T_N = 1.6$ K. This transition is strongly first order,
as indicated by the sharpness of the heat capacity anomaly, thermal hysteresis
in the magnetic susceptibility, and a non-divergent relaxation rate in $\mu$SR.
The form of the heat capacity below $T_N$ suggests that the ground state is an
anisotropic collinear antiferromagnet with an excitation spectrum that is
gapped by 0.245(1) meV. The ordering temperature in Gd$_2$Pt$_2$O$_7$, $T_N =
1.6$ K, is a substantial 160% increase from other gadolinium pyrochlores, which
have been found to order at 1 K or lower. We attribute this enhancement in
$T_N$ to the $B$-site cation, platinum, which, despite being non-magnetic, has
a filled $5d$ $t_{2g}$ orbital and an empty $5d$ $e_g$ orbital that can
facilitate superexchange. Thus, the magnetic frustration in Gd$_2$Pt$_2$O$_7$
is partially ""relieved"", thereby promoting magnetic order.

charge conduction in DNA molecules [L. Xiang {\it et al.}, Nature Chem. 7,

support charge delocalization within G segments, and thus an intermediate
coherent-incoherent conduction. We begin our analysis with a highly simplified
1-dimensional tight-binding model, while introducing environmental effects
through B\""uttiker's probes. This minimal model allows us to gain fundamental
understanding of transport mechanisms and derive analytic results for molecular
resistance in different limits. We then use a more detailed ladder-model

effects captured by B\""uttiker's probes. We find that hopping conduction
dominates in alternating sequences, while in stacked sequences charge
delocalization (visualized directly through the electronic density matrix)
supports significant resonant-ballistic charge dynamics reflected by an
even-odd effect and a weak distance dependence for resistance. Our analysis

resolution images of the SiO(2-1) and HCN(1-0) emission lines obtained with the
IRAM plateau de Bure (PdBI) interferometer and combined with data from the IRAM
30 m radiotelescope. These data were complemented by a Herschel column density
map of the region. We performed spectral analysis of SiO and HCN emission line
profiles to identify protostellar outflows and spatially disentangle two
velocity components associated with low- and high-velocity shocks. Then, we
compared the low-velocity shock component to a dedicated grid of
one-dimensional (1D) radiative shock models. We find that the SiO emission
originates from a mixture of high-velocity shocks caused by bipolar outflows
and low-velocity shocks. Using SiO and HCN emission lines, we extract seven
bipolar outflows associated with massive dense cores previously identified
within the W43-MM1 mini-starburst cluster. Comparing observations with
dedicated Paris-Durham shock models constrains the velocity of the low-velocity
shock component from 7 to 12km/s. The SiO arising from low-velocity shocks
spreads along the complete length of the ridge. Its contribution represents at
least 45% and up to 100% of the total SiO emission depending on the area
considered. The low-velocity component of SiO is most likely associated with

spin-dependent part of differential cross-sections can be factorized with
various hadronic matrix elements of twist-2 and twist-3 operators. These
operators can be of even- and odd-chirality. In this work, the studied
observables of asymmetries are differential cross-sections with different
weights. These weights are selected so that the observables are spin-dependent
and their virtual corrections are completely determined by quark form factor.
In the calculations of one-loop corrections we meet collinear divergences in
the contributions involving chirality-odd and chirality-even operators. We find
that all of the divergences can be correctly subtracted. Therefore, our results
give an explicit example of QCD factorization with twist-3 operators,

lensing, we compare the full covariance with the ""jackknife"" (JK) covariance,
the method often used in the literature that estimates the covariance from the
resamples of the data itself. We show that there exists the variation of JK
covariance over realizations of mock lensing measurements, while the average JK
covariance over mocks can give a reasonably accurate estimation of the true
covariance up to separations comparable with the size of JK subregion. The
scatter in JK covariances is found to be $\sim10\%$ after we subtract the
lensing measurement around random points. However, the JK method tends to
underestimate the covariance at the larger separations, more increasingly for a
survey with a higher number density of source galaxies. We apply our method to
the the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) data, and show that the 48 mock SDSS
catalogs nicely reproduce the signals and the JK covariance measured from the
real data. We then argue that the use of the accurate covariance, compared to
the JK covariance, allows us to use the lensing signals at large scales beyond
a size of the JK subregion, which contains cleaner cosmological information in
the linear regime.

transition temperature T$_c$ monotonically decreases from 2.3 K (x=0) to 0.8 K

the same time, the Ni substitution yields the NFL behavior at zero field for

temperature, C$_p$/T, and magnetic susceptibility, M/B. The NFL behavior in
magnetic fields for x=0.25 is quite similar to that seen at around the SC upper
critical field in pure CeCoIn$_5$, suggesting that both compounds are governed
by the same antiferromagnetic quantum criticality. The resemblance of the
doping effect on the SC order among Ni- , Sn-, and Pt-substituted CeCoIn5
supports the argument that the doped carriers are primarily responsible for the

Given a hypergraph $H=(V,E)$ with $n = |V|$, $m = |E|$ and $p = \sum_{e \in E}
|e|$ the best known algorithm to compute a global minimum cut in $H$ runs in
time $O(np)$ for the uncapacitated case and in $O(np + n^2 \log n)$ time for
the capacitated case. We show the following new results.
  1. Given an uncapacitated hypergraph $H$ and an integer $k$ we describe an
algorithm that runs in $O(p)$ time to find a subhypergraph $H'$ with sum of
degrees $O(kn)$ that preserves all edge-connectivities up to $k$ (a
$k$-sparsifier). This generalizes the corresponding result of Nagamochi and
Ibaraki from graphs to hypergraphs. Using this sparsification we obtain an $O(p
+ \lambda n^2)$ time algorithm for computing a global minimum cut of $H$ where
$\lambda$ is the minimum cut value.
  2. We generalize Matula's argument for graphs to hypergraphs and obtain a
$(2+\epsilon)$-approximation to the global minimum cut in a capacitated
hypergraph in $O(\frac{1}{\epsilon} (p \log n + n \log^2 n))$ time.
  3. We show that a hypercactus representation of all the global minimum cuts
of a capacitated hypergraph can be computed in $O(np + n^2 \log n)$ time and
$O(p)$ space.
  We utilize vertex ordering based ideas to obtain our results. Unlike graphs
we observe that there are several different orderings for hypergraphs which

processes are based on gene expression. For example, an activated gene may be
required to reach in a precise time a threshold level of expression that
triggers a specific downstream process. However, gene expression is subject to
stochastic fluctuations, naturally inducing an uncertainty in this
threshold-crossing time with potential consequences on biological functions and
phenotypes. Here, we consider such ""timing fluctuations"", and we ask how they
can be controlled. Our analytical estimates and simulations show that, for an
induced gene, timing variability is minimal if the threshold level of
expression is approximately half of the steady-state level. Timing fuctuations
can be reduced by increasing the transcription rate, while they are insensitive
to the translation rate. In presence of self-regulatory strategies, we show
that self-repression reduces timing noise for threshold levels that have to be
reached quickly, while selfactivation is optimal at long times. These results
lay a framework for understanding stochasticity of endogenous systems such as
the cell cycle, as well as for the design of synthetic trigger circuits.

experimentally demonstrated. In these devices the Coulomb potential of an atom
creates a localised electron state with a large charging energy and
considerable orbital level spacings, enabling robust charge capturing
processes. In these single-atom pumps, the confinement potential is hardly
affected by the periodic driving of the system. This is in contrast to the
often used gate-defined quantum dot pumps, for which a strongly time-dependent
potential leads to significantly different charge pumping processes. Here we
describe the behaviour and the performance of an atomic, single parameter,
electron pump. This is done by considering the loading, isolating and unloading
of one electron at the time, on a phosphorous atom embedded in a silicon double
gate transistor. The most important feature of the atom pump is its very
isolated ground state, which can be populated through the fast loading of much
higher lying excited states and a subsequent fast relaxation proces. This leads
to a substantial increase in pumping accuracy, and is opposed to the adverse
role of excited states as observed for quantum dot pumps due to non-adiabatic
excitations. The pumping performances are investigated as a function of dopant
position, revealing a pumping behaviour robust against the expected variability
in atomic position.

been well studied in recent years. However, most of the results are based on
qubits. In this paper, We investigate the applications of 2-qutrit entanglement
in the braiding associated with $\mathbb{Z}_3$ parafermion. The 2-qutrit
entangled state $|\Psi(\theta)\rangle$, generated by acting the localized
unitary solution $\breve{R}(\theta)$ of YBE on 2-qutrit natural basis, achieves
its maximal $\ell_1$-norm and maximal von Neumann entropy simultaneously at
$\theta=\pi/3$. Meanwhile, at $\theta=\pi/3$, the solutions of YBE reduces
braid matrices, which implies the role of $\ell_1$-norm and entropy plays in
determining real physical quantities. On the other hand, we give a new
realization of 4-anyon topological basis by qutrit entangled states, then the
$9\times9$ localized braid representation in 4-qutrit tensor product space
$(\mathbb{C}^3)^{\otimes 4}$ are reduced to Jones representation of braiding in
the 4-anyon topological basis. Hence, we conclude that the entangled states are
powerful tools in analysing the characteristics of braiding and

find that independent of the reactive gas flow (\pn) used during sputtering,
the phases of Co-N formed at this temperature seems to be identical having N
\pat~$\sim$5. This is contrary to Co-N phases formed at lower \Ts. For
\Ts$\sim$300\,K, an evolution of Co-N phases starting from
Co(N)$\rightarrow$\tcn$\rightarrow$Co$_3$N$\rightarrow$CoN can be seen as \pn
increases to 100\p, whereas when the substrate temperature increases to 523\,K,
the phase formed is a mixture of Co and \tcn, independent of the {\pn} used
during sputtering. We used x-ray diffraction (XRD) to probe long range
ordering, x-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) at Co absorption edge for the
local structure, Magneto-optical Kerr e ffect (MOKE) and polarized neutron
reflectivity (PNR) to measure the magnetization of samples. Quantification of N
\pat~was done using secondary ion mass spectroscopy (SIMS). Measurements
suggest that the magnetic moment of Co-N samples deposited at 523\,K is
slightly higher than the bulk Co moment and does not get affected with the

about the phase formation of Co-N thin films which is discussed in this work.

Intriguingly our results demonstrate that in order to achieve the topological

  Convolutional Neural Network",,,,,"physics.med-ph cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Limited angle problem is a challenging issue in x-ray computed tomography
(CT) field. Iterative reconstruction methods that utilize the additional prior
can suppress artifacts and improve image quality, but unfortunately require
increased computation time. An interesting way is to restrain the artifacts in
the images reconstructed from the practical filtered back projection (FBP)
method. Frikel and Quinto have proved that the streak artifacts in FBP results
could be characterized. It indicates that the artifacts created by FBP method
have specific and similar characteristics in a stationary limited-angle
scanning configuration. Based on this understanding, this work aims at
developing a method to extract and suppress specific artifacts of FBP
reconstructions for limited-angle tomography. A data-driven learning-based
method is proposed based on a deep convolutional neural network. An end-to-end
mapping between the FBP and artifact-free images is learned and the implicit
features involving artifacts will be extracted and suppressed via nonlinear
mapping. The qualitative and quantitative evaluations of experimental results
indicate that the proposed method show a stable and prospective performance on
artifacts reduction and detail recovery for limited angle tomography. The
presented strategy provides a simple and efficient approach for improving image
quality of the reconstruction results from limited projection data.

exhibit good recovery performance. We study the recovery performance of OLS in
a specific dictionary called \emph{generalized hybrid dictionary}, which is

environment at an amazing speed despite large cross cultural variations in
amount and complexity of the available language input. Understanding this
simple fact still escapes current cognitive and linguistic theories. Recently,
spectacular progress in the engineering science, notably, machine learning and
wearable technology, offer the promise of revolutionizing the study of
cognitive development. Machine learning offers powerful learning algorithms
that can achieve human-like performance on many linguistic tasks. Wearable
sensors can capture vast amounts of data, which enable the reconstruction of
the sensory experience of infants in their natural environment. The project of
'reverse engineering' language development, i.e., of building an effective
system that mimics infant's achievements appears therefore to be within reach.
Here, we analyze the conditions under which such a project can contribute to
our scientific understanding of early language development. We argue that
instead of defining a sub-problem or simplifying the data, computational models
should address the full complexity of the learning situation, and take as input
the raw sensory signals available to infants. This implies that (1) accessible
but privacy-preserving repositories of home data be setup and widely shared,
and (2) models be evaluated at different linguistic levels through a benchmark
of psycholinguist tests that can be passed by machines and humans alike, (3)
linguistically and psychologically plausible learning architectures be scaled

learning. We discuss the feasibility of this approach and present preliminary

  ""Recurrent Neural Machine Translation""",,,,"cs.CL","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The vanilla sequence-to-sequence learning (seq2seq) reads and encodes a
source sequence into a fixed-length vector only once, suffering from its
insufficiency in modeling structural correspondence between the source and
target sequence. Instead of handling this insufficiency with a linearly
weighted attention mechanism, in this paper, we propose to use a recurrent
neural network (RNN) as an alternative (Cseq2seq-I). During decoding,
Cseq2seq-I cyclically feeds the previous decoding state back to the encoder as
the initial state of the RNN, and reencodes source representations to produce
context vectors. We surprisingly find that the introduced RNN succeeds in
dynamically detecting translationrelated source tokens according to the partial
target sequence. Based on this finding, we further hypothesize that the partial
target sequence can act as a feedback to improve the understanding of the
source sequence. To test this hypothesis, we propose cyclic
sequence-to-sequence learning (Cseq2seq-II) which differs from the seq2seq only
in the reintroduction of previous decoding state into the same encoder. We
further perform parameter sharing on Cseq2seq-II to reduce parameter redundancy
and enhance regularization. In particular, we share the weights of the encoder
and decoder, and two targetside word embeddings, making Cseq2seq-II equivalent
to a single conditional RNN model, with 31% parameters pruned but even better
performance. Cseq2seq-II not only preserves the simplicity of seq2seq but also
yields comparable and promising results on machine translation tasks.
Experiments on Chinese- English and English-German translation show that
Cseq2seq achieves significant and consistent improvements over seq2seq and is
as competitive as the attention-based seq2seq model.

chain models and show that the ratios of the quantities among different
topological types do not depend on the existence of excluded volume if the
topological polymers have only up to trivalent vertices, as far as the polymers
investigated. We also evaluate the ratio of the gyration radius to the
hydrodynamic radius, which we expect to be universal from the viewpoint of
renormalization group. Furthermore, we show that the short-distance intrachain
correlation is much enhanced for topological polymers expressed with complex
graphs.

in quantum information processing and communication in the microwave regime. In
this work, we describe a proposal of a multi-output single-photon device. We
consider two superconducting resonators coupled to a gap-tunable qubit via both
its longitudinal and transverse degrees of freedom. Thus, this qubit-resonator
coupling differs from the coupling in standard circuit quantum-electrodynamic
systems described by the Jaynes-Cummings model. We demonstrate that an
effective quadratic coupling between one of the normal modes and the qubit can
be induced, and this induced second-order nonlinearity is much larger than that
for conventional Kerr-type systems exhibiting photon blockade. Assuming that a
coupled normal mode is resonantly driven, we observe that the output fields
from the resonators exhibit strong sub-Poissonian photon-number statistics and
photon antibunching. Contrary to previous studies on resonant photon blockade,
the first-excited state of our device is a pure single-photon Fock state rather
than a polariton state, i.e., a highly hybridized qubit-photon state. In
addition, it is found that the optical state truncation caused by the strong
qubit-induced nonlinearity can lead to an entanglement between the two
resonators, even in their steady state under the Markov approximation.

Class 0 protostellar binary IRAS 16293-2422 using the Atacama Large
Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA). The survey covers the full frequency
range from 329 to 363 GHz (0.8 mm) with additional targeted observations at 3.0
and 1.3 mm. More than 10,000 features are detected toward one component in the
protostellar binary. Glycolaldehyde, its isomers, methyl formate and acetic
acid, and its reduced alcohol, ethylene glycol, are clearly detected. For
ethylene glycol both lowest state conformers, aGg' and gGg', are detected, the
latter for the first time in the ISM. The abundance of glycolaldehyde is
comparable to or slightly larger than that of ethylene glycol. In comparison to
the Galactic Center, these two species are over-abundant relative to methanol,
possibly an indication of formation at low temperatures in CO-rich ices. Both
13C and deuterated isotopologues of glycolaldehyde are detected, also for the
first time ever in the ISM. For the deuterated species, a D/H ratio of
approximately 5% is found with no differences between the deuteration in the
different functional groups of glycolaldehyde. Measurements of the 13C-species
lead to a 12C:13C ratio of approximately 30, lower than the typical ISM value.
This low ratio may reflect an enhancement of 13CO in the ice due to either
ion-molecule reactions in the gas before freeze-out or differences in the
temperatures where 12CO and 13CO ices sublimate. The results reinforce the
importance of low-temperature grain surface chemistry for the formation of
prebiotic molecules seen here in the gas after sublimation of the entire ice
mantle.

hydrodynamic description of (visco)elastic composite materials. For this
purpose, additional strain variables reflect the state of the inclusions and
their immediate environment. These additional strain variables in general are
not set by a coarse-grained macroscopic displacement field. Apart from that,

translations and relative rotations that were previously introduced in
different contexts. As a central point, our approach reveals and classifies the
importance of a new macroscopic variable: relative strains. We analyze two

where each antenna of the upper level is made up of a subarray on the lower

Firstly, the spatial multiplexing of a Line-of-Sight (LoS) MIMO system is
exploited. It is based on appropriate (sub-)array distances and achieves
multiplexing gain due to phase differences among the signals at the receive
(sub-)arrays. Secondly, one or more additional reflected paths of different
angles (separated from the LoS path by different spatial beams at the
subarrays) are used to exploit spatial multiplexing between paths.
  By exploiting the above two multiplexing kinds simultaneously, a high
dimensional system with maximum spatial multiplexing is proposed by jointly
using 'phase differences' within paths and 'angular differences' between paths.
The system includes an advanced hybrid beamforming architecture with large
subarray separation, which could occur in millimeter wave backhaul scenarios.
The possible gains of the system w.r.t. a pure LOS MIMO system are illustrated
by evaluating the capacities with total transmit power constraints.

distribution, fixed by Tan's contact coefficients, constitutes a direct
signature of strong correlations in a short-range interacting quantum gas. Here
we consider a repulsive multicomponent Fermi gas under harmonic confinement, as
in the experiment of Pagano et al. [Nat. Phys. {\bf 10}, 198 (2014)], realizing
a gas with tunable $SU(\kappa)$ symmetry. We exploit an exact solution at
infinite repulsion to show a direct correspondence between the value of the
Tan's contact for each of the $\kappa$ components of the gas and the Young
tableaux for the $S_N$ permutation symmetry group identifying the magnetic
structure of the ground-state. This opens a route for the experimental
determination of magnetic configurations in cold atomic gases, employing only
standard (spin-resolved) time-of-flight techniques. Combining the exact result
with matrix-product-states simulations, we obtain the Tan's contact at all
values of repulsive interactions. We show that a local density approximation
(LDA) on the Bethe-Ansatz equation of state for the homogeneous mixture is in
excellent agreement with the results for the harmonically confined gas. At
strong interactions, the LDA predicts a scaling behavior of the Tan's contact.
This provides a useful analytical expression for the dependence on the number
of fermions, number of components and on interaction strength. Moreover, using
a virial approach in the limit of infinite interactions, we show that the
contact increases with the temperature and the number of components. At zero
temperature, we predict that the weight of the momentum distribution tails
increases with interaction strength and the number of components if the
population per component is kept constant. This latter property was

power spectral density Sh = 4x10^-24 Hz^-1/2 in the frequency interval [70,
200] Hz, which is overall commensurate with the advanced detector design
sensitivities. The pipeline detected 128 signals, and the weakest signal
injected and detected has a GW strain amplitude of ~10^-24, assuming one month
of gapless data collected by a single advanced detector. We also provide
sensitivity estimations, which show that, for a single- detector data covering
one month of observation time, depending on the source orbital Doppler
modulation, we can detect signals with an amplitude of ~7x10^-25. By using
three detectors, and one year of data, we would easily gain more than a factor
3 in sensitivity, translating into being able to detect weaker signals. We also

computational budget, which is extremely cheap. In fact, sifting one month of

We show how the extendability of a partial coloring into an equitable coloring

checked via flow algorithms. Computational experiments show that the search
tree of enumerative algorithms can be significantly reduced in size by these
rules and, in most instances, such naive approach even yields a faster
algorithm. Moreover, the stability, i.e., the number of solved instances within

consuming, we derive arithmetic pruning rules (generalized Hall-conditions)
from the network model. Adding these rules to an enumerative algorithm yields
an even larger runtime improvement.

support a picture in which the Curie terms arise from oxygen disorder in the
Cu-O chains. This agrees with published work on polycrystalline samples where
the sample cooling rate was varied, but here we show that the Curie plots

dynamical properties of a platoon of vehicles traversing a straight road. In
this paper, we investigate the impact of delayed feedback on the dynamics of

no delay, small delay and arbitrary delay regimes. First, we derive a
sufficient condition for local stability of the CCFM in no-delay and
small-delay regimes using. Next, we derive the necessary and sufficient
condition for local stability of the CCFM for an arbitrary delay. We then
demonstrate that the transition of traffic flow from the locally stable to the
unstable regime occurs via a Hopf bifurcation, thus resulting in limit cycles
in system dynamics. Physically, these limit cycles manifest as back-propagating
congestion waves on highways. In the context of human-driven vehicles, our work
provides phenomenological insight into the impact of reaction delays on the
emergence and evolution of traffic congestion. In the context of self-driven
vehicles, our work has the potential to provide design guidelines for control
algorithms running in self-driven cars to avoid undesirable phenomena.
Specifically, designing control algorithms that avoid jerky vehicular movements
is essential. Hence, we derive the necessary and sufficient condition for
non-oscillatory convergence of the CCFM. Next, we characterize the rate of
convergence of the CCFM, and bring forth the interplay between local stability,
non-oscillatory convergence and the rate of convergence of the CCFM. Further,
to better understand the oscillations in the system dynamics, we characterize
the type of the Hopf bifurcation and the asymptotic orbital stability of the
limit cycles using Poincare normal forms and the center manifold theory. The
analysis is complemented with stability charts, bifurcation diagrams and MATLAB
simulations.

to the successful operation of digital radio experiments and due to the
improved quantitative understanding of the emission, radio detection is back on
the list of promising techniques for extensive air showers. With a threshold of
about 100 PeV radio detectors are particularly useful to study the
highest-energy galactic cosmic rays and ultra-high-energy extragalactic
particles of all types. Various antenna arrays like LOPES, CODALEMA, AERA,
LOFAR, and Tunka-Rex have shown that radio measurements can compete in
precision with other techniques, in particular for the arrival direction, the
energy, and the position of the shower maximum. The scientific potential of the
radio technique seems to be maximum in combination with particle detectors,
which increases the total accuracy for air-shower measurements. This is crucial
for a better separation of different primary particles, like gamma-ray photons,
neutrinos, or different types of nuclei. In addition to air-showers the radio
technique can be used for particle cascades in dense media. Several pioneering

solving partial differential equations. Numerous particle flow filters have
been proposed based on different assumptions concerning the flow dynamics.
Approximations are needed in the implementation of all of these filters; as a

  Constraints",,,,,"cs.DS","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We study various generalizations of the secretary problem with submodular
objective functions. Generally, a set of requests is revealed step-by-step to
an algorithm in random order. For each request, one option has to be selected
so as to maximize a monotone submodular function while ensuring feasibility.
For our results, we assume that we are given an offline algorithm computing an
$\alpha$-approximation for the respective problem. This way, we separate
computational limitations from the ones due to the online nature. When only
focusing on the online aspect, we can assume $\alpha = 1$.
  In the submodular secretary problem, feasibility constraints are cardinality
constraints. That is, out of a randomly ordered stream of entities, one has to
select a subset size $k$. For this problem, we present a
$0.31\alpha$-competitive algorithm for all $k$, which asymptotically reaches
competitive ratio $\frac{\alpha}{e}$ for large $k$. In submodular secretary
matching, one side of a bipartite graph is revealed online. Upon arrival, each
node has to be matched permanently to an offline node or discarded irrevocably.
We give an $\frac{\alpha}{4}$-competitive algorithm. In both cases, we improve
over previously best known competitive ratios, using a generalization of the
algorithm for the classic secretary problem.
  Furthermore, we give an $O(\alpha d^{-\frac{2}{B-1}})$-competitive algorithm
for submodular function maximization subject to linear packing constraints.
Here, $d$ is the column sparsity, that is the maximal number of none-zero
entries in a column of the constraint matrix, and $B$ is the minimal capacity
of the constraints. Notably, this bound is independent of the total number of
constraints. We improve the algorithm to be $O(\alpha
d^{-\frac{1}{B-1}})$-competitive if both $d$ and $B$ are known to the algorithm
beforehand.

characterized by anomalous suppression of large-scale density fluctuations.
Here we substantially broaden the hyperuniformity concept along four different
directions. This includes generalizations to treat fluctuations in the
interfacial area in heterogeneous media and surface-area driven evolving
microstructures, random scalar fields, divergence-free random vector fields, as
well as statistically anisotropic many-particle systems and two-phase media.
Interfacial-area fluctuations play a major role in characterizing the
microstructure of two-phase systems , physical properties that intimately
depend on the geometry of the interface, and evolving two-phase microstructures
that depend on interfacial energies (e.g., spinodal decomposition). In the
instances of divergence-free random vector fields and statistically anisotropic
structures, we show that the standard definition of hyperuniformity must be
generalized such that it accounts for the dependence of the relevant spectral
functions on the direction in which the origin in Fourier space
(nonanalyticities at the origin). Using this analysis, we place some well-known
energy spectra from the theory of isotropic turbulence in the context of this
generalization of hyperuniformity. We show that there exist many-particle
ground-state configurations in which directional hyperuniformity imparts exotic
anisotropic physical properties (e.g., elastic, optical and acoustic
characteristics) to these states of matter. Such tunablity could have
technological relevance for manipulating light and sound waves in ways
heretofore not thought possible. We show that disordered many-particle systems
that respond to external fields (e.g., magnetic and electric fields) are a
natural class of materials to look for directional hyperuniformity.

fully differential in the final state kinematics and includes the decay of the
Higgs boson to a photon pair. It allows one to make next-to-next-to- leading

for the transverse momentum distribution of the Higgs boson, accounting for the

well-described for both experiments, we agree on the normalization only for

expense of an increased theory uncertainty. We make predictions for Higgs
production observables at the 13 TeV LHC, which are in good agreement with

isotropic transmitter powers for these exoplanets; a small handful of the
closest objects (10s of pc) yield our best limits of order $10^{14}$ W
(Equivalent Isotropic Radiated Power: EIRP). These limits lie above the highest
power directional transmitters near these frequencies currently operational on

(called source user) of a social network (called source network) joins a new
social network (called target network), a new inter-network link (called anchor
link) is formed between the source and target networks. In this paper, we
concentrated on predicting the formation of such anchor links between

which the formation of a link between two existing users within a single

will be added to the target network once the anchor link is created. To solve

model different aspects of social factors that may affect a source user to join

unprecedented suite of state-of-the-art scientific instruments enabling for the
first time ever the simultaneous spectral-timing-polarimetry studies of cosmic
sources in the energy range from 0.5-30 keV (and beyond). Key elements of the
payload are: the Spectroscopic Focusing Array (SFA) - a set of 11 X-ray optics
for a total effective area of about 0.9 m^2 and 0.6 m^2 at 2 keV and 6 keV
respectively, equipped with Silicon Drift Detectors offering <180 eV spectral
resolution; the Large Area Detector (LAD) - a deployable set of 640 Silicon
Drift Detectors, for a total effective area of about 3.4 m^2, between 6 and 10
keV, and spectral resolution <250 eV; the Polarimetry Focusing Array (PFA) - a
set of 2 X-ray telescope, for a total effective area of 250 cm^2 at 2 keV,
equipped with imaging gas pixel photoelectric polarimeters; the Wide Field
Monitor (WFM) - a set of 3 coded mask wide field units, equipped with
position-sensitive Silicon Drift Detectors, each covering a 90 degrees x 90
degrees FoV. The eXTP international consortium includes mostly major
institutions of the Chinese Academy of Sciences and Universities in China, as
well as major institutions in several European countries and the United States.
The predecessor of eXTP, the XTP mission concept, has been selected and funded
as one of the so-called background missions in the Strategic Priority Space
Science Program of the Chinese Academy of Sciences since 2011. The strong
European participation has significantly enhanced the scientific capabilities

differences between how the clock reacts when exposed to different
concentrations of elements of the periodic table? If so, can we characterise
these differences?
  We approach these questions by analysing and modelling circadian plant data,
where the levels of expression of a luciferase reporter gene were measured at
regular intervals over a number of days after exposure to different
concentrations of lithium.
  A key aspect of circadian data analysis is to determine whether a time series
(derived from experimental data) is `rhythmic' and, if so, to determine the
underlying period. However, our dataset displays nonstationary traits such as
changes in amplitude, gradual changes in period and phase-shifts.
  In this paper, we develop clustering methods using a wavelet transform.
Wavelets are chosen as they are ideally suited to identifying discriminant
local time and scale features. Furthermore, we propose treating the observed
time series as realisations of locally stationary wavelet processes. This
allows us to define and estimate the evolutionary wavelet spectrum. We can then
compare, in a quantitative way, using a functional principal components
analysis, the time-frequency patterns of the time series. Our approach uses a
clustering algorithm to group the data according to their time-frequency
patterns. We demonstrate the advantages of our methodology over alternative
approaches and show that it successfully clusters our data.

way to characterize stationary activity of neural populations. Such stationary
activity of neurons may be expected for recordings from in vitro slices or

awake animals has been more challenging because both spike-rates and
interactions can change according to sensory stimulation, behavior, or an
internal state of the brain. Previous approaches modeling the dynamics of
neural interactions suffer from computational cost; therefore, its application
was limited to only a dozen neurons. Here by introducing multiple analytic
approximation methods to a state-space model of neural population activity, we
make it possible to estimate dynamic pairwise interactions of up to 60 neurons.
More specifically, we applied the pseudolikelihood approximation to the
state-space model, and combined it with the Bethe or TAP mean-field
approximation to make the sequential Bayesian estimation of the model
parameters possible. The large-scale analysis allows us to investigate dynamics
of macroscopic properties of neural circuitries underlying stimulus processing

and demonstrate utilities of these measures by analyzing activity of monkey V4

frequency division duplex (FDD) massive MIMO systems, where the base station
(BS) equipped with a large number of antennas serves a number of single-antenna
users simultaneously. To obtain the channel state information (CSI) at the BS
in FDD systems, the downlink channel has to be estimated by users via downlink
training and then fed back to the BS. For FDD large-scale MIMO systems, the
overhead for downlink training and CSI uplink feedback could be prohibitively
high, which presents a significant challenge. In this paper, we study the
behavior of the minimum mean-squared error (MMSE) estimator when the channel
covariance matrix has a low-rank or an approximate low-rank structure. Our
theoretical analysis reveals that the amount of training overhead can be
substantially reduced by exploiting the low-rank property of the channel
covariance matrix. In particular, we show that the MMSE estimator is able to
achieve exact channel recovery in the asymptotic low-noise regime, provided
that the number of pilot symbols in time is no less than the rank of the
channel covariance matrix. We also present an optimal pilot design for the
single-user case, and an asymptotic optimal pilot design for the multi-user
scenario. Lastly, we develop a simple model-based scheme to estimate the
channel covariance matrix, based on which the MMSE estimator can be employed to
estimate the channel. The proposed scheme does not need any additional training
overhead. Simulation results are provided to verify our theoretical results and
illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed estimated covariance-assisted MMSE
estimator.

line contact models that assume distributed contact forces. In this work, it
will be shown that line contact formulations provide accurate and robust
mechanical models in the range of small contact angles, whereas the
computational efficiency considerably decreases with increasing contact angles.
On the other hand, point contact formulations serve as sufficiently accurate
and very efficient models in the regime of large contact angles, while they are
not applicable for small contact angles as a consequence of non-unique closest
point projections. In order to combine the advantages of these basic
formulations, a novel all-angle beam contact (ABC) formulation is developed
that applies a point contact formulation for large contact angles and a
recently developed line contact formulation for small contact angles, the two
being smoothly connected by means of a variationally consistent model
transition. Based on a stringent analysis, two different transition laws are
investigated, optimal algorithmic parameters are suggested and conservation of
energy and momentum is shown. All configuration-dependent quantities are
consistently linearized, thus allowing for their application within implicit
time integration schemes. Furthermore, a step size control of the nonlinear
solution scheme that allows for large displacement increments per time step and
an efficient two-stage contact search based on dynamically adapted search
segments are proposed. A series of numerical test cases is analyzed in order to
verify the accuracy and consistency of the proposed contact model transition
regarding contact force distributions and conservation properties, but also for
quantifying the efficiency gains as compared to standard beam contact

becomes appreciably shorter when fast neutrino reactions are present, because
the possibility to balance part of the magnetic force with pressure gradients
is reduced. We also find short ambipolar diffusion timescales in the case of
superconducting cores for $T \lesssim 10^9$ K, due to the reduced interaction
between protons and neutrons. In the most favourable scenario, with fast

that yields a well-posed problem. Small modifications to the original code are

alternative to traditional chemical pest control. In many cases, this involves
a one-off or periodic release of naturally occurring and/or genetically
modified enemies such as predators, parasitoids, or pathogens. As the
interaction between these enemies and the pest is complex and the production of
natural enemies potentially expensive, it is not surprising that both the
efficacy and economic viability of biological pest control are debated. Here,
we investigate the performance of very simple control strategies. In
particular, we show how Pareto-efficient one-off or periodic release
strategies, that optimally trade off between efficacy and economic viability,
can be devised and used to enable high efficacy at small economic costs. We
demonstrate our method on a pest-pathogen-crop model with a tunable immigration
rate of pests. By analyzing this model, we demonstrate that simple
Pareto-efficient one-off and periodic release strategies are efficacious and
simultaneously have profits that are close to the theoretical maximum obtained
by strategies optimizing only the profit. When the immigration rate of pests is
low to intermediate, one-off control strategies are sufficient, and when the
immigration of pests is high, periodic release strategies are preferable. The
methods presented here can be extended to more complex scenarios and be used to
identify promising biological pest control strategies in many circumstances.

exactly for arbitrary number of particles (at least in simple cases, such as
equal masses and spring constants). A nice feature of the harmonic chain is
that the final result for the displacements of the individual particles can be
easily understood -- therefore, this example fits well into a course of
classical mechanics for undergraduates. Here we show how to calculate the
displacements by solving equations of motion for the Laplace transforms
$\mathcal{L}\left\{q_n\right\}(s)$ of the displacements $q_n(t)$. This leads to
a continued fraction representation of the Laplace transforms which can be
evaluated analytically. The inverse Laplace transform of
$\mathcal{L}\left\{q_n\right\}(s)$ finally gives the displacements which
generically have the form of Bessel functions. We also comment on the
similarities between this approach and the Green function method for quantum
many-particle systems.

platform to find mechanisms for enhancement of superconductivity, exploiting
shape resonances in different superconducting properties. Here we evaluate the
superconducting gap and its spatial profile, the multiple gap components, and
the chemical potential, of generic superconducting nanofilms, considering the
pairing attraction and its energy scale as tunable parameters, from weak to
strong coupling, at fixed electron density. Superconducting properties are
evaluated at mean field level as a function of the thickness of the nanofilm,
in order to characterize the shape resonances in the superconducting gap. We
find that the most pronounced shape resonances are generated for weakly coupled
superconductors, while approaching the strong coupling regime the shape
resonances are rounded by a mixing of the subbands due to the large energy gaps
extending over large energy scales. Finally, we find that the spatial profile,
transverse to the nanofilm, of the superconducting gap acquires a flat behavior
in the shape resonance region, indicating that a robust and uniform multigap
superconducting state can arise at resonance.

possible thanks to an additive dispersive product sprinkled at the water
surface. Vegetation characteristics and water surfaces during steady flows from
6 different plant spatial design on channel bottom for 4 plant species were
thus measured. Vegetation blockage factors at channel scale were estimated from
TLS points clouds and analyzed.

the genesis of cyclic thrombocytopenia based on clinical information. We
provide excellent model fits to the existing data for both platelet counts and
thrombopoietin levels by changing six parameters that have physiological
correlates. Our results indicate that the primary change in cyclic
thrombocytopenia is a major interference with or destruction of the
thrombopoietin receptor with secondary changes in other processes, including
immune-mediated destruction of platelets and megakaryocyte deficiency and
failure in platelet production. This study makes a major contribution to the
understanding of the origin of cyclic thrombopoietin as well as significantly
extending the modeling of thrombopoiesis.

current literature. In the existing experimental works, situations where all
subjects are connected with each other through direct visual and auditory
coupling, and social interaction affects their coordination, have been
investigated. Here, we study coordination in human ensembles via a novel
computer-based set-up that enables individuals to coordinate each other's
motion from a distance so as to minimize the influence of social interaction.
The proposed platform makes it possible to implement different visual
interaction patterns among the players, so that participants take into
consideration the motion of a designated subset of the others. This allows the
evaluation of the exclusive effects on coordination of the structure of
interconnections among the players and their own dynamics. Our set-up enables
also the deployment of virtual players to investigate dyadic interaction
between a human and a virtual agent, as well as group synchronization in mixed
teams of human and virtual agents. We use this novel set-up to study
coordination both in dyads and in groups over different structures of
interconnections, with and without virtual agents. We find that, in dual
interaction, virtual players manage to interact with participants in a
human-like fashion, thus confirming findings in previous work. We also observe
that, in group interaction, the level of coordination among humans in the
absence of direct visual and auditory coupling depends on the structure of
interconnections among participants. This confirms, as recently suggested in
the literature, that different coordination levels are achieved over diverse
visual pairings in the presence and in the absence of social interaction. We
present preliminary experimental results on the effect on group coordination of
deploying virtual computer agents in the human ensemble.
