association. While its OB members are well studied, its low-mass population has
received little attention. We present high-spatial resolution Chandra ACIS-I
X-ray data, where we detect 1613 point X-ray sources. Our main aim is to
clarify global properties of NGC6231 down to low masses through a detailed
membership assessment, and to study the cluster stars' spatial distribution,
the origin of their X-ray emission, the cluster age and formation history, and
initial mass function. We use X-ray data, complemented by optical/IR data, to
establish cluster membership. The spatial distribution of different stellar
subgroups also provides highly significant constraints on cluster membership,
as does the distribution of X-ray hardness. We perform spectral modeling of
group-stacked X-ray source spectra. We find a large cluster population down to
~0.3 Msun (complete to ~1 Msun), with minimal non-member contamination, with a
definite age spread (1-8 Myrs) for the low-mass PMS stars. We argue that
low-mass cluster stars also constitute the majority of the few hundreds
unidentified X-ray sources. We find mass segregation for the most massive
stars. The fraction of circumstellar-disk bearing members is found to be ~5%.
Photoevaporation of disks under the action of massive stars is suggested by the
spatial distribution of the IR-excess stars. We also find strong Halpha
emission in 9% of cluster PMS stars. The dependence of X-ray properties on
mass, stellar structure, and age agrees with extrapolations based on other
young clusters. The cluster initial mass function, computed over ~2 dex in
mass, has a slope Gamma~-1.14. The total mass of cluster members above 1 Msun
is 2280 Msun, and the inferred total mass is 4380 Msun. We also study the
peculiar, hard X-ray spectrum of the Wolf-Rayet star WR79.

algorithm converges locally to a strict equilibrium and the rate of convergence
is exponentially fast - of the order of
$\mathcal{O}(\exp(-a\sum_{j=1}^{t}\gamma_{j}))$ where $a>0$ is a constant and
$\gamma_{j}$ is the algorithm's step-size. In the presence of uncertainty,
convergence requires a more conservative step-size policy, but with high

with an exponential cutoff at 2.7$\pm$1.2$\pm$1.3 GeV (the first/second
uncertainties correspond to statistical/systematic errors) is preferred over a

hints at a magnetospheric origin of the emission. In addition, no extended
gamma-ray emission is detected compatible with either the supernova remnant
(CTA 1) or the very high energy (> 100 GeV) pulsar wind nebula. A flux upper
limit of 6.5$\times$10$^{-12}$ erg cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$ in the 10-300 GeV energy
range is reported, for an extended source assuming the morphology of the
VERITAS detection. During on-peak phases, a sub-exponential cutoff is
significantly preferred ($\sim$11 $\sigma$) for representing the spectral
energy distribution, both in the phase-averaged and in the phase-resolved
spectra. Three glitches are detected during the observation period and we found
no flux variability at the time of the glitches or in the long-term behavior.

consequence of different exchange interactions experienced by the electron,

driving of a quantum system can freeze its dynamics to a subspace, effectively
truncating the Hilbert space of the system. It represents the quantum version
of the famous flying arrow Zeno paradox. Here, we study how temporal
stochasticity in the system observation (or driving) affects the survival
probability of the system in the subspace. In particular, we introduce a strong
and a weak Zeno regime for which we quantify the confinement by providing an
analytical expression for this survival probability. We investigate several
dissipative and coherent protocols to confine the dynamics, and show that they
can be successfully adapted to the stochastic version. In the weak Zeno regime
the dynamics within the subspace effectively acts as an additional source of
stochasticity in the confinement protocol. Our analytical predictions are
numerically tested and verified on a paradigmatic spin chain. As practical
implications different coherent and dissipative confinement protocols allow to
choose a trade-off between a probabilistic scheme with high fidelity (compared
to perfect subspace dynamics) and a deterministic one with a slightly lower
fidelity, which is a step towards better control in future quantum
technologies.

rigid, and we give an integral representation for the solutions. More
generally, twisting by line bundles corresponds to isomonodromy deformations,
so this gives rise to Lax pairs. When the moduli space is 2-dimensional, one
obtains Lax pairs for the elliptic Painlev\'e equation; this associates a Lax
pair to any rational number, of order twice the denominator. There is also an

equivalence between categories of elliptic difference equations, swapping the

gauge theory and loop quantum gravity in $(2+1)$ dimensions, the fusion basis.
In doing so, we shift the focus from the original lattice (or spin-network)
structure directly to that of the magnetic (curvature) and electric (torsion)
excitations themselves. These excitations are classified by the irreducible
representations of the Drinfel'd double of the gauge group, and can be readily
""fused"" together by studying the tensor product of such representations. We
will also describe in detail the ribbon operators that create and measure these
excitations and make the quasi-local structure of the observable algebra
explicit. Since the fusion basis allows for both magnetic and electric
excitations from the onset, it turns out to be a precious tool for studying the
large scale structure and coarse-graining flow of lattice gauge theories and
loop quantum gravity. This is in neat contrast with the widely used
spin-network basis, in which it is much more complicated to account for
electric excitations, i.e. for Gau\ss~constraint violations, emerging at larger
scales. Moreover, since the fusion basis comes equipped with a hierarchical
structure, it readily provides the language to design states with sophisticated
multi-scale structures. Another way to employ this hierarchical structure is to
encode a notion of subsystems for lattice gauge theories and $(2+1)$ gravity
coupled to point particles. In a follow-up work, we will exploit this notion to
provide a new definition of entanglement entropy for these theories.

risks Cox model, often the cause of failure is unknown for some of the cases.
The probability of a missing cause is typically assumed to be independent of
the cause given the time of the event and covariates measured before the event
occurred. In practice, however, the underlying missing-at-random assumption
does not necessarily hold. Motivated by colorectal cancer subtype analysis, we
develop semiparametric methods to conduct valid analysis, first when additional
auxiliary variables are available for cases only. We consider a weaker
missing-at-random assumption, with missing pattern depending on the observed
quantities, which include the auxiliary covariates. Overlooking these
covariates will potentially result in biased estimates. We use an informative
likelihood approach that will yield consistent estimates even when the
underlying model for missing cause of failure is misspecified. We then consider
a method to conduct valid statistical analysis when there are no auxiliary
covariates in the not missing-at-random scenario. The superiority of our
methods in finite samples is demonstrated by simulation study results. We
illustrate the use of our method in an analysis of colorectal cancer data from
the Nurses' Health Study cohort, where, apparently, the traditional
missing-at-random assumption fails to hold for particular molecular subtypes.

conformally to the matter fields. The weak equivalence principle is therefore
satisfied, but scalar effects may arise in strong-field regimes, e.g. allowing
for violations of the strong equivalence principle in neutron stars

proposed by Damour and Esposito-Far\`ese is in tension with solar-system

cosmological evolution of the scalar field and no mass term is included in the

ascertain if, in this way, solar-system tests can be passed, while retaining a
non-trivial phenomenology for neutron stars. We find that even with this

passes both Big-Bang nucleosynthesis and solar-system constraints, while
simultaneously allowing for scalarization in isolated/binary neutron stars.

fitting is compatible with that from core-shift modelling for plausible

caused by intermittency of accretion. Long periods of quiescence cause the
energy in the radio lobes, accumulated over the lifetime of the blazar, to be
much less than that estimated based on the present luminous state. In addition,
the power calculated using the radio lobes can be underestimated for
intrinsically compact jets, in which the radio core flux can be
over-subtracted. In our second hypothesis, the radio-lobe method is assumed to
be correct, and the blazar-fit and core-shift powers are reduced due to the
presence of $\sim15$ pairs per proton, and a larger magnetization than usually

techniques, with a particular focus on their generalization beyond one loop. We
start with a brief discussion of the one-loop scenario, a case in which
integrand-reduction algorithms are well established and played over the past
decade an important role in the development of automated tools for the
theoretical evaluation of physical observables. The generalization of
integrand-reduction techniques to all loops has been the subject of several
efforts in the recent past, thus providing a better understanding of the
universal properties of scattering amplitudes. The ultimate goal of these
studies is the development of efficient alternative computational techniques
for the evaluation of Feynman integrals beyond one loop.

optical/UV observations of HI in absorption at high redshift ($1<z<4$) to
derive constraints on the evolution of the HI-mass halo-mass (HIHM) relation

draw constraints on the evolution of the HIHM relation from the observed HI

high-sensitivity ($0.2$mJy beam$^{-1}$; $\sim0.2$M$_{\odot}$) 1.07 mm dust
continuum observations from the Atacama Large Millimeter Array (ALMA) to
identify a network of narrow, $0.028\,\pm\,0.005$pc wide, filamentary
structures. These are a factor of $\gtrsim3$ narrower than the proposed
'quasi-universal' $\sim0.1$pc width of interstellar filaments. Additionally, 28
compact objects are reported, spanning a mass range $0.3{\rm M_{\odot}}<M_{\rm

forming coevally with more massive counterparts. Comparing to the popular
'bead-on-a-string' analogy, the protocluster hub is poorly represented by a
monolithic clump embedded within a single filament. Instead, it comprises
multiple intra-hub filaments, each of which retains its integrity as an
independent structure and possesses its own embedded core population.

NH$_{3}$ and HCOOH to form the salt NH$_{4}^{+}$HCOO$^{-}$. We observe salt
growth at temperatures as low as 15K, indicating that this reaction is feasible
in cold environments. The kinetics of salt growth are best fit by a two-step

The reaction energy barrier is determined to be 70 $\pm$ 30K with a

actively accreting several dwarf galaxies and their globular clusters (GCs).
Detailed abundances can chemically link clusters to their birth environments,
establishing whether or not a GC has been accreted from a satellite dwarf
galaxy. This talk presents the detailed chemical abundances of seven M31 outer
halo GCs (with projected distances from M31 greater than 30 kpc), as derived
from high-resolution integrated-light spectra taken with the Hobby Eberly
Telescope. Five of these clusters were recently discovered in the Pan-Andromeda
Archaeological Survey (PAndAS)---this talk presents the first determinations of
integrated Fe, Na, Mg, Ca, Ti, Ni, Ba, and Eu abundances for these clusters.
Four of the target clusters (PA06, PA53, PA54, and PA56) are metal-poor
($[\rm{Fe/H}] < -1.5$), $\alpha$-enhanced (though they are possibly less
alpha-enhanced than Milky Way stars at the 1 sigma level), and show signs of
star-to-star Na and Mg variations. The other three GCs (H10, H23, and PA17) are
more metal-rich, with metallicities ranging from [Fe/H] = -1.4 to -0.9. While
H23 is chemically similar to Milky Way field stars, Milky Way GCs, and other
M31 clusters, H10 and PA17 have moderately-low [Ca/Fe], compared to Milky Way
field stars and clusters. Additionally, PA17's high [Mg/Ca] and [Ba/Eu] ratios
are distinct from Milky Way stars, and are in better agreement with the stars
and clusters in the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC). None of the clusters studied
here can be conclusively linked to any of the identified streams from PAndAS;
however, based on their locations, kinematics, metallicities, and detailed
abundances, the most metal-rich PAndAS clusters H23 and PA17 may be associated
with the progenitor of the Giant Stellar Stream, H10 may be associated with the
SW Cloud, and PA53 and PA56 may be associated with the Eastern Cloud.

factor of two. The enhancement due to the perturbative QCD correlation \12

rapidities is found to explain 60 $\div$ 80 \% of the discrepancy. We argue
that the nonperturbative fluctuations leading to non-factorized (correlated)

the double parton GPD play an important role in this kinematics. Combined, the
two correlation mechanisms provide a good description of the rate of double

for ions and PBK distribution for electrons, the decrease of the kappa index in
the PBK electron distribution contributes to reduce the growth rate of the EMIC
instability, but the reduction effect is less pronounced than the increase
obtained with ion PBK distribution with the same $\kappa$ index. The results
obtained also show that, as a general rule, the presence of a dust population
contributes to reduce the instability in magnitude of the growth rates and
range, but that in the case of PBK ion distribution with small kappa indexes
the instability may continue to occur for dust populations which would
eliminate completely the instability in the case of bi-Maxwellian ion

In ultra-cold atom systems in optical lattices and photonic networks, this
allows to simulate exotic phases of matter such as quantum Hall phases,

paper, we apply the Floquet theory to engineer anisotropic Haldane models on
the honeycomb lattice and two-leg ladder systems. We show that these
anisotropic Haldane models still possess a topologically non-trivial band
structure associated with chiral edge modes (without the presence of a net unit
flux in a unit cell), then referring to the quantum anomalous Hall effect.
Focusing on (interacting) boson systems in s-wave bands of the lattice, we show
how to engineer through the Floquet theory, a quantum phase transition between
a uniform superfluid and a BEC (Bose-Einstein Condensate) analog of FFLO
(Fulde-Ferrell-Larkin-Ovchinnikov) states, where bosons condense at non-zero
wave-vectors. We perform a Ginzburg-Landau analysis of the quantum phase
transition on the graphene lattice, and compute observables such as chiral
currents and the momentum distribution. The results are supported by exact
diagonalization calculations and compared with those of the isotropic
situation. The validity of high-frequency expansion in the Floquet theory is
also tested using time-dependent simulations for various parameters of the
model. Last, we show that the anisotropic choice for the effective vector
potential allows a bosonization approach in equivalent ladder (strip)

the overall `dip' activity was dramatically enhanced over that during its
discovery with Kepler K2. By the end of our reported observations the dip
activity had declined to a level close to its K2 discovery state. Three notable
events were observed. In 2016 January a large number of dust clouds appeared

ansatz over a symmetry-adapted reference determinant. Remarkably, this
expansion has an analytic expression that we were able to decipher. While the
form of the polynomial expansion is universal, the excitation amplitudes need
to be optimized. This is equivalent to the optimization of orbitals in the
conventional projected Hartree-Fock framework of non-orthogonal determinants.
Using the inverse of the particle-hole expansion, we similarity transform the
Hamiltonian in a coupled-cluster style theory. The left eigenvector of the
non-hermitian Hamiltonian is constructed in a similar particle-hole expansion
fashion, and we show that to numerically reproduce variational projected
Hartree-Fock results, one needs as many pair excitations in the bra as the
number of strongly correlated entangled pairs in the system. This
single-excitation polynomial similarity transformation theory is an alternative
to our recently presented double excitation theory, but supports projected
Hartree-Fock and coupled cluster simultaneously rather than interpolating
between them.

We consider two different scenarios: Ultrashort terahertz (THz) excitations or
a sudden electric field quench. Performing analytical and numerical exact
diagonalization calculations we trace the pulse induced spin dynamics and
extract quantities that are relevant to quantum information processing. In
particular, we analyze the dynamics of the system chirality, the von Neumann
entropy, the pairwise and the many body entanglement. If the characteristic
frequencies of the generated states are non-commensurate then a partial loss of
pair concurrence occurs. Increasing the system size this effect becomes even
more pronounced. Many particle entanglement and chirality are robust and
persist in the incommensurate phase. To analyze the dynamical quantum
transitions for the quenched and pulsed dynamics we combined the Weierstrass
factorization technique for entire functions and Lanczos exact diagonalization
method. For a small system we obtained analytical results including the rate
function of Loschmidt echo. Exact numerical calculations for a system up to 40
spins confirm phase transition. Quench- induced dynamical transitions have been
extensively studied recently. Here we show that related dynamical transitions
can be achieved and controlled by appropriate electric field pulses.

parametric families of probability distributions. If interest is restricted to
a subfamily of distributions, then it is natural to inquire if the restricted
LRT is superior to the unrestricted LRT. Marden's general LRT conjecture posits
that any restriction placed on the alternative hypothesis will increase power.
The only published counterexample to this conjecture is rather technical and
involves a restriction that maintains the dimension of the alternative. We
formulate the dimension-restricted LRT conjecture, which posits that any
restriction that replaces a parametric family with a subfamily of lower
dimension will increase power. Under standard regularity conditions, we then
demonstrate that the restricted LRT is asymptotically more powerful than the
unrestricted LRT for local alternatives. Remarkably, however, even the
dimension-restricted LRT conjecture fails in the case of finite samples. Our
counterexamples involve subfamilies of multinomial distributions. In
particular, our study of the Hardy-Weinberg subfamily of trinomial
distributions provides a simple and elegant demonstration that restrictions may
not increase power.

recast the DD problem as a sparse linear system whose unknown consists of Robin
data on the interfaces between subdomains---two unknowns per interface. The
Robin-to-Robin maps are computed in terms of well-conditioned boundary integral

using an analytic theory and numerical simulations. We particularly focus on
how the planetary mass $M_{\rm oli}$ at the onset of oligarchic growth depends
on the initial mass $m_0$ of a planetesimal. Oligarchic growth commences when
the velocity dispersion relative to the Hill velocity of the protoplanet takes
its minimum. We find that if $m_0$ is small enough, this normalized velocity
dispersion becomes as low as unity during the intermediate stage between the
runaway and oligarchic growth stages. In this case, $M_{\rm oli}$ is
independent of $m_0$. If $m_0$ is large, on the other hand, oligarchic growth
commences directly after runaway growth, and $M_{\rm oli} \propto m_0^{3/7}$.
The planetary mass $M_{\rm oli}$ for the solid surface density of the Minimum
Mass Solar Nebula is close to the masses of the dwarf planets in a reasonable
range of $m_0$. This indicates that they are likely to be the largest remnant
planetesimals that failed to become planets. The power-law exponent $q$ of the
differential mass distribution of remnant planetesimals is typically $-2.0$ and
$-2.7$ to $-2.5$ for small and large $m_0$. The slope, $q \simeq -2.7$, and the
bump at $10^{21}$ g (or 50 km in radius) for the mass distribution of hot
Kuiper belt objects are reproduced if $m_0$ is the bump mass. On the other
hand, small initial planetesimals with $m_0 \sim 10^{13}$ g or less are favored
to explain the slope of large asteroids, $q \simeq -2.0$, while the bump at

a powerful model-independent probe of the underlying cosmology. A measurement
of the first and second order redshift derivatives appears to be well within
the reach of upcoming surveys using ELT-HIRES and the SKA Phase 2 array. Here
we show that an unambiguous prediction of the R_h=ct cosmology is zero drift at
all redshifts, contrasting sharply with all other models in which the expansion
rate is variable. For example, multi-year monitoring of sources at redshift z=5
with the ELT-HIRES is expected to show a velocity shift Delta v = -15 cm/s/yr
due to the redshift drift in Planck LCDM, while Delta v=0 cm/s/yr in R_h=ct.
With an anticipated ELT-HIRES measurement error of +/-5 cm/s/yr after 5 years,
these upcoming redshift drift measurements might therefore be able to
differentiate between R_h=ct and Planck LCDM at ~3 sigma, assuming that any
possible source evolution is well understood. Such a result would provide the
strongest evidence yet in favour of the R_h=ct cosmology. With a 20-year
baseline, these observations could favor one of these models over the other at
better than 5 sigma.

transport energy from a planet's highly irradiated dayside to its eternally
dark nightside) show considerable variation between exoplanets. Theoretical
models predict a positive correlation between heat redistribution efficiency
and temperature for tidally locked planets; however, recent HST WASP-43b
spectroscopic phase curve results are inconsistent with current predictions.
Using the Spitzer Space Telescope, we obtained a total of three phase curve
observations of WASP-43b (P=0.813 days) at 3.6 and 4.5 microns. The first 3.6
micron visit exhibits spurious nightside emission that requires invoking
unphysical conditions in our cloud-free atmospheric retrievals. The two other
visits exhibit strong day-night contrasts that are consistent with the HST
data. To reconcile the departure from theoretical predictions, WASP-43b would
need to have a high-altitude, nightside cloud/haze layer blocking its thermal
emission. Clouds/hazes could be produced within the planet's cool, nearly
retrograde mid-latitude flows before dispersing across its nightside at high
altitudes. Since mid-latitude flows only materialize in fast-rotating
($\lesssim1$ day) planets, this may explain an observed trend connecting
measured day-night contrast with planet rotation rate that matches all current
Spitzer phase curve results. Combining independent planetary emission
measurements from multiple phases, we obtain a precise dayside hemisphere H2O
abundance ($2.5\times 10^{-5} - 1.1\times 10^{-4}$ at 1$\sigma$ confidence)
and, assuming chemical equilibrium and a scaled solar abundance pattern, we
derive a corresponding metallicity estimate that is consistent with being solar
(0.4 -- 1.7). Using the retrieved global CO+CO2 abundance under the same
assumptions, we estimate a comparable metallicity of 0.3 - 1.7$\times$ solar.

explicitly designed to solve prediction problems very well. Achieving this goal
does not imply that these methods automatically deliver good estimators of
causal parameters. Examples of such parameters include individual regression
coefficients, average treatment effects, average lifts, and demand or supply
elasticities. In fact, estimates of such causal parameters obtained via naively
plugging ML estimators into estimating equations for such parameters can behave
very poorly due to the regularization bias. Fortunately, this regularization
bias can be removed by solving auxiliary prediction problems via ML tools.
Specifically, we can form an orthogonal score for the target low-dimensional
parameter by combining auxiliary and main ML predictions. The score is then
used to build a de-biased estimator of the target parameter which typically
will converge at the fastest possible 1/root(n) rate and be approximately
unbiased and normal, and from which valid confidence intervals for these
parameters of interest may be constructed. The resulting method thus could be
called a ""double ML"" method because it relies on estimating primary and
auxiliary predictive models. In order to avoid overfitting, our construction
also makes use of the K-fold sample splitting, which we call cross-fitting.
This allows us to use a very broad set of ML predictive methods in solving the
auxiliary and main prediction problems, such as random forest, lasso, ridge,
deep neural nets, boosted trees, as well as various hybrids and aggregators of
these methods.

system during its interacting processes with the environment. When there is
magnetic flux threading through the ring, by allocating the flux phase factor
into the tunneling amplitudes between the QDs and the leads in different ways,
the Hamiltonian of the system can be written into different formalisms. We
calculate the transmission through the ring by using these different
non-Hermitian Hamiltonians and prove that it is not dependent on the way we
treat the phase factor, as in the Hermitian case. In addition, with appropriate
parameters, the asymmetric Fano profile will show up in the conductance
spectrum just by tuning the physical gain and loss of the system. The Fano
effect originates from the interferences of electrons traversing different
channels which are broadened or narrowed down due to the interaction between
the QDs and the environment. The proof we provide and the transport properties

Based on the compute unified device architecture (CUDA), two kernels with

optimal design of data structures for several kinds of intermediate information
are presented, to improve the efficiency of internal memory transactions.
Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed decoder achieves high

the many advantages of cloud infrastructure, such as shared computing resources

propose a novel caching framework aimed at fully exploiting the potential of
such Cloud-based RAN (C-RAN) systems through cooperative hierarchical caching
which minimizes the network costs of content delivery and improves users'
Quality of Experience (QoE). In particular, we consider the cloud-cache in the
cloud processing unit (CPU) as a new layer in the RAN cache hierarchy, bridging
the capacity-performance gap between the traditional edge-based and core-based
caching schemes. A delay cost model is introduced to characterize and formulate
the cache placement optimization problem, which is shown to be NP-complete. As
such, a low complexity, heuristic cache management strategy is proposed,
constituting of a proactive cache distribution algorithm and a reactive cache
replacement algorithm. Extensive numerical simulations are carried out using
both real-world YouTube video requests and synthetic content requests. It is
demonstrated that our proposed Octopus caching strategy significantly
outperforms the traditional caching strategies in terms of cache hit ratio,
average content access delay and backhaul traffic load.

These decay widths in the hadronic medium are calculated as arising from the

obtained in a chiral effective model. The decay amplitude in the present model
is multiplied with a strength parameter for the light quark pair creation,
which is fitted from the observed vacuum partial decay width of the bottomonium

strangeness fraction of the hadronic matter on the decay widths, arising due to
the mass modifications due to these effects, have also been studied. There is
observed to be appreciable effects from density, and the effects from isospin
asymmetry on the parital decay widths of $\Upsilon \rightarrow B\bar B$ are
observed to be quite pronounced at high densities. These effects should show up
in the asymmetric heavy ion collisions in Compressed baryonic matter (CBM)

transferred to the top part of the shock. This source transfer is co-incident
with the presence of shock decay and enhancing signatures observed at the

frequently be available as point referenced (geostatistical) observations that
are clustered into multiple sites rather than uniformly spaced across the area
of interest. In such situations, the similarity of the dominant processes
influencing the observed data across sites and the accuracy with which models
fitted to data from one site can predict data from another site provide
valuable information for scientists seeking to make inferences from these data.
Such information may motivate a more informed second round of modelling of the
data and also provides insight into the generality of the models developed and
an indication of how these models may perform at predicting observations from
other sites. We have investigated the geographic transferability of site
specific models and compared the results of using different implementations of
site specific effects in models for data combined from two sites. Since we have
access to data on a broad collection of environmental characteristics that each
held potential to aid the interpolation of our geostatistical response
observations we have investigated these issues within the framework of a
computationally efficient method for variable selection when the number of
explanatory variables exceeds the number of observations. We have applied Least

high-dimensional and the underlying distributions may be non-normal. The
classifier is constructed as a linear combination of two easily computable and
interpretable components, the $U$-component and the $P$-component. The
$U$-component is a linear combination of $U$-statistics which are averages of
bilinear forms of pairwise distinct vectors from two independent samples. The
$P$-component is the discriminant score and is a function of the projection of
the $U$-component on the observation to be classified. Combined, the two
components constitute an inherently bias-adjusted classifier valid for
high-dimensional data. The simplicity of the classifier helps conveniently
study its properties, including its asymptotic normal limit, and extend it to
multi-sample case. The classifier is linear but its linearity does not rest on
the assumption of homoscedasticity. Probabilities of misclassification and
asymptotic properties of their empirical versions are discussed in detail.
Simulation results are used to show the accuracy of the proposed classifier for
sample sizes as small as 5 or 7 and any large dimensions. Applications on real

algorithm that poses the minimal number of questions to an end user while
guaranteeing that the target hypothesis is discovered. Such guarantees are
practically important because they ensure that end users will not be
overburdened with unnecessary questions.
  We present SPEX -- a learning algorithm that addresses the above challenge.
SPEX considers the hypothesis space of formulas over first-order predicates and
learns the correct hypothesis by only asking the user simple membership queries
for concrete examples. Thus, SPEX is directly applicable to any learning
problem that fits its hypothesis space and uses membership queries.
  SPEX works by iteratively eliminating candidate hypotheses from the space
until converging to the target hypothesis. The main idea is to use the
implication order between hypotheses to guarantee that in each step the
question presented to the user obtains maximal pruning of the space. This
problem is particularly challenging when predicates are potentially correlated.
  To show that SPEX is practically useful, we expressed two rather different
applications domains in its framework: learning programs for the domain of
technical analysts (stock trading) and learning data structure specifications.
The experimental results show that SPEX's optimality guarantee is effective: it
drastically reduces the number of questions posed to the user while
successfully learning the exact hypothesis.

not simple singular points or lines, but have a large structured core.
Specifically, we observe five different types of cholesteric shells. We study
the statistical distribution of the different types of shells as a function of

with these parameters, we are able to induce transitions between different

matrix $A$) of a graph $\Gamma$, with $d$ distinct eigenvalues other than its
spectral radius $\lambda_0$, usually provides a lot of information about the
structure of $G$. Moreover, from ${\rm sp\,}\Gamma$ we can define the so-called
predistance polynomials $p_0,\ldots,p_d\in {\mathbb R}_d[x]$, with ${\rm dgr\,}

$\langle f, g\rangle_{\Gamma} =\frac{1}{n}{\rm tr\,}(f(A)g(A))$ and normalized
in such a way that $\|p_i\|_{\Gamma}^2=p_i(\lambda_0)$. They can be seen as a
generalization for any graph of the distance polynomials of a distance-regular
graph. Going further, we consider the preintersection numbers $\xi_{ij}^h$ for
$i,j,h\in\{0,\ldots,d\}$, which generalize the intersection numbers of a
distance-regular graph, and they are the Fourier coefficients of $p_ip_j$ in
terms of the basis $\{p_h\}_{0\le h\le d}$. The aim of this paper is to show
that, for any graph $\Gamma$, the information contained in its spectrum,
predistance polynomials, and preintersection numbers is equivalent. Also, we
give some characterizations of distance-regularity which are based on the above
concepts. For instance, we comment upon the so-called spectral excess theorem
stating that a connected regular graph $G$ is distance-regular if and only if
its spectral excess, which is the value of $p_d$ at $\lambda_0$, equals the

Type N bursts appear as the letter ""N"" in the radio dynamic spectrum and reveal
a magnetic mirror effect in coronal loops. Here, we report a well-observed
N-shaped burst consisting of three successive branches at metric wavelength
with both fundamental and harmonic components and a high brightness temperature
($>$10$^9$ K). We verify the burst as a true type N burst generated by the same
electron beam from three aspects of the data. First, durations of the three
branches at a given frequency increase gradually, may due to the dispersion of
the beam along its path. Second, the flare site, as the only possible source of
non-thermal electrons, is near the western feet of large-scale closed loops.
Third, the first branch and the following two branches are localized at
different legs of the loops with opposite sense of polarization. We also find
that the sense of polarization of the radio burst is in contradiction to the
O-mode and there exists a fairly large time delay ($\sim$3-5 s) between the
fundamental and harmonic components. Possible explanations accounting for these
observations are presented. Assuming the classical plasma emission mechanism,
we can infer coronal parameters such as electron density and magnetic field
near the radio source and make diagnostics on the magnetic mirror process.

transmit antenna selection (TAS) schemes is investigated. A closed-form
solution for the maximum constant arrival rate of this network with statistical
delay quality of service (QoS) constraint is extracted in the quasi-static
fading channel. This study is conducted in two different cases. When channel
state information (CSI) is not available at the MIMO transmitter,
implementation of TAS is difficult. Therefore, RAS scheme is employed and one
antenna with the maximum instantaneous signal to noise ratio (SNR) is chosen at
the receiver. On the other hand, when CSI is available at the transmitter, TAS
scheme is executed. In this case one antenna is selected at the transmitter.
Moreover, an optimal power-control policy is applied to the selected antenna
and the effective capacity of the MIMO system is derived. Finally, this optimal
power adaptation and the effective capacity are investigated in two asymptotic
cases with the loose and strict QoS requirements. In particular, we show that
in the TAS scheme with the loose QoS restriction, the effective capacity
converges to the ergodic capacity. Then, an exact closed-form solution is
obtained for the ergodic capacity of the channel here.

Inquiry: Simultaneously indexing two or more multidimensional arrays with
different shapes (e.g., copying data from one tensor to another larger, zero
padded tensor in anticipation of a convolution) is difficult to do efficiently:
Hard-coded nested for loops in C, Fortran, and Go cannot be applied when the
dimension of a tensor is unknown at compile time. Likewise, boost::multi_array
cannot be used unless the dimensions of the array are known at compile time,
and the style of implementation restricts the user from using the index tuple
inside a vectorized operation (as would be required to compute an expected
value of a multidimensional distribution). On the other hand, iteration methods
that do not require the dimensionality or shape to be known at compile time
(e.g., incrementing and applying carry operations to index tuples or remapping
integer indices in the flat array), can be substantially slower than hard-coded
nested for loops. ... Importance: Manipulation of multidimensional arrays is a
common task in software, especially in high performance numerical methods. This
paper proposes a novel way to leverage template recursion to iterate over and
apply operations to multidimensional arrays, and then demonstrates the superior
performance and flexibility of operations that can be achieved using this new
approach.

of the gravitational processes that usually assumed. We study the quantum
cosmology of the $f(R,T)$ gravity theory, in which the effective Lagrangian of
the gravitational field is given by an arbitrary function of the Ricci scalar,
and the trace of the matter energy-momentum tensor, respectively. For the
background geometry we adopt the Friedmann--Robertson--Walker metric, and we
assume that matter content of the Universe consists of a perfect fluid. We
obtain the general form of the gravitational Hamiltonian, of the quantum
potential, and of the canonical momenta, respectively. This allows us to
formulate the full Wheeler-de Witt equation describing the quantum properties
of this modified gravity model. As a specific application we consider in detail
the quantum cosmology of the $f(R,T)=F^0(R)+\theta RT$ model, in which $F^0(R)$
is an arbitrary function of the Ricci scalar, and $\theta $ is a function of
the scale factor only. The Hamiltonian form of the equations of motion, and the

heterobilayers with small twisting and/or lattice mismatch lead to the
interesting concept of Moir\'e superlattice, where the atomic registry is
locally indistinguishable from commensurate bilayers but has local-to-local
variation over long range. Here we show that such Moir\'e superlattice can lead
to periodic modulation of local topological order in vdW heterobilayers formed

exist at the TI/NI phase boundaries. By using symmetry based k.p and

problem due to the nature of comprising substances. Hard plaques are easily
discernible in CTA data cloud due to apparent bright behaviour, therefore many
approaches have been proposed for automatic segmentation of calcified plaques.
In contrast soft plaques show very small difference in intensity with respect
to surrounding heart tissues & blood voxels. This similarity in intensity makes
the isolation and detection of soft plaques very difficult. This work aims to
develop framework for segmentation of vulnerable plaques with minimal user
dependency. In first step automatic seed point has been established based on
the fact that coronary artery behaves as tubular structure through axial
slices. In the following step the behaviour of contrast agent has been modelled
mathematically to reflect the dye diffusion in respective CTA volume.
Consequently based on detected seed point & intensity behaviour, localized
active contour segmentation has been applied to extract complete coronary tree.
Bidirectional segmentation has been applied to avoid loss of coronary
information due to the seed point location whereas auto adjustment feature of
contour grabs new emerging branches. Medial axis for extracted coronary tree is
generated using fast marching method for obtaining curve planar reformation for
validation of contrast agent behaviour. Obtained coronary tree is to be
evaluated for soft plaques in second phase of this research.

We report evidence of rotational motions of horizontal helical threads in two
active-region prominences observed by the \emph{Hinode} and/or \emph{IRIS}
satellites at high resolution. In the first event, we found transverse motions
of brightening threads at speeds up to 55~km~s$^{-1}$ seen in the plane of the
sky. Such motions appeared as sinusoidal space--time trajectories with a
typical period of $\sim$390~s, which is consistent with plane-of-sky
projections of rotational motions. Phase delays at different locations suggest
propagation of twists along the threads at phase speeds of 90--270~km~s$^{-1}$.
At least 15 episodes of such motions occurred in two days, none associated with
any eruption. For these episodes, the plane-of-sky speed is linearly correlated
with the vertical travel distance, suggestive of a constant angular speed. In
the second event, we found Doppler velocities of 30--40~km~s$^{-1}$ in opposite
directions in the top and bottom portions of the prominence, comparable to the
plane-of-sky speed. The moving threads have about twice broader line widths
than stationary threads. These observations, when taken together, provide
strong evidence for rotations of helical prominence threads, which were likely
driven by unwinding twists triggered by magnetic reconnection between twisted

consider repulsively interacting fermions on the diamond chain, a simplest
quasi-one-dimensional system that contains a flat band. Exact diagonalization
and the density-matrix renormalization group (DMRG) are used to show that we
have a significant binding energy of a Cooper pair with a long-tailed pair-pair
correlation in real space when the total band filling is slightly below $1/3$,
where the dispersive band interacts with the flat band that is empty but close
to $E_F$. Pairs selectively formed across the outer sites of the diamond chain
are responsible for the pairing correlation. At exactly $1/3$-filling an
insulating phase emerges, where the entanglement spectrum indicates the
particles on the outer sites are highly entangled and topological. These come
from a peculiarity of the flat band in which ""Wannier orbits"" are not
orthogonalizable.

the literature of randomness extraction and tamper-resilient cryptography. Our
main results are:
  (1) An explicit seeded non-malleable extractor with error $\epsilon$ and seed
length $d=O(\log n)+O(\log(1/\epsilon)\log \log (1/\epsilon))$, that supports
min-entropy $k=\Omega(d)$ and outputs $\Omega(k)$ bits. Combined with the
protocol in \cite{DW09}, this gives a two round privacy amplification protocol
with optimal entropy loss in the presence of an active adversary, for all
security parameters up to $\Omega(k/\log k)$.
  (2) An explicit non-malleable two-source extractor for min-entropy $k \geq
(1-\gamma)n$, some constant $\gamma>0$, that outputs $\Omega(k)$ bits with
error $2^{-\Omega(n/\log n)}$. Combined with the connection in \cite{CG14b}
this gives a non-malleable code in the two-split-state model with relative rate
$\Omega(1/\log n)$. This exponentially improves previous constructions, all of
which only achieve rate $n^{-\Omega(1)}$.\footnote{The work of Aggarwal et. al
\cite{ADKO15} had a construction which ""achieves"" constant rate, but recently
the author found an error in their proof.}
  (3)A two-source extractor for min-entropy $O(\log n \log \log n)$, which also
implies a $K$-Ramsey graph on $N$ vertices with $K=(\log N)^{O(\log \log \log
N)}$. We also obtain a seeded non-malleable $9$-source extractor with optimal
seed length, which in turn gives a $10$-source extractor for min-entropy
$O(\log n)$. Previously the best known extractor for such min-entropy requires
$O(\log \log n)$ sources \cite{CohL16}.
  Independent of our work, Cohen \cite{Cohen16} obtained similar results to (1)
and the two-source extractor, except the dependence on $\epsilon$ is
$\log(1/\epsilon)(\log \log (1/\epsilon))^{O(1)}$ and the two-source extractor
requires min-entropy $\log n (\log \log n)^{O(1)}$.

approach. We explicitly find these deformed Friedmann equations governing the
modified GUP-corrected dynamics of such a Universe. It is shown that the
modified GUP-deformed Jacobson's approach implies an upper bound for the
density of such a Universe. The Big Bang singularity can therefore also be
avoided using the modified GUP-corrections to horizons' thermodynamics. In
fact, we are able to analyze the pre Big Bang state of the Universe.

candidate to replace photomultiplier tubes (PMT) for weak light detection.
However, in conventional APDs, a large portion of carrier energy drawn from the
electric field is thermalized, and the multiplication efficiencies of electron
and hole are low and close. In order to achieve high gain, the device should
work under breakdown bias, where carrier multiplication proceeds
bi-directionally to form a positive feedback multiplication circle. However,
breakdown is hard to control, in practice, APDs should work under Geiger mode
as a compromise between sustainable detection and high gain. The complexity of
system seriously restricts the application. Here, we demonstrate an avalanche
photodiode holding high gain without breakdown, which means no quenching
circuit is needed for sustainable detection. The device is based on a GaN/AlN
periodically-stacked-structure (PSS), wherein electron holds much higher
efficiency than hole to draw energy from the electric field, and avalanche
happens uni-directionally with high efficiency. and a recorded high gain (10^4)
tested under constant bias is obtained in a prototype device, wherein the
stable gain can be determined by the periodicity of the GaN/AlN PSS. This work
not only brings a new light into avalanche multiplication mechanism, but also
paves a technological path with high commercial value to realize highly

first time. We then apply this quantitative definition to formulate a {\it
semantic information theory}. We present the first formal definition of a {\it
semantic information amount}, which is the core concept of the semantic
information theory, that is based only on concretely defined notions. Previous
semantic information theories defined this amount under some a priori
information which is not concretely specified. We then unveil several
fundamental properties in the semantic information theory, e.g., a semantic
source coding theorem, semantic channel coding theorem, and effectiveness
coding theorem. Although the semantic information theory has a long history of
research going back more than six decades, there has been no study on its
relation to organized complexity. This paper offers the first unified paradigm
of organized complexity and semantic information theory.

  hydrodynamics","5 pages 2 figures",,,,"physics.flu-dyn cond-mat.stat-mech","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The particle diffusion in a fluid is a classical topic that dates back to
more than one century ago. However, a full solution to this issue still lacks.
In this work the velocity autocorrelation function and the diffusion constant
are derived analytically, and the hydrodynamics effect on the particle
diffusion is analyzed in detail. Unlike previous studies, the ring-collision
effect is exhaustively considered in our treatment, and the hydrodynamics
approach is extended to the whole time range. Large scale molecular dynamics
simulations for the hard-disk fluid show that our analytical results are valid
up to the density close to the crystallization point.

time of open path integral Monte Carlo simulations can be much smaller compared
to standard ones using ring polymers. We also provide an intuitive explanation
based on the role of instantons as transition states of the path integral
pseudodynamics. Therefore we propose that, in all cases when the ground state
approximation to the finite temperature partition function holds, open path
integral simulations can be used to accelerate the sampling in realistic
simulations aimed to explore nuclear quantum effects.

expertise, which is now unfeasible for many tasks owing to the large volumes of
text and authors in practical applications. In this study, we introduce a
methodology based on the dynamics of word co-occurrence networks representing
written texts to classify a corpus of 80 texts by 8 authors. The texts were
divided into sections with equal number of linguistic tokens, from which time
series were created for 12 topological metrics. The series were proven to be
stationary (p-value>0.05), which permits to use distribution moments as
learning attributes. With an optimized supervised learning procedure using a
Radial Basis Function Network, 68 out of 80 texts were correctly classified,
i.e. a remarkable 85% author matching success rate. Therefore, fluctuations in
purely dynamic network metrics were found to characterize authorship, thus
opening the way for the description of texts in terms of small evolving
networks. Moreover, the approach introduced allows for comparison of texts with
diverse characteristics in a simple, fast fashion.
