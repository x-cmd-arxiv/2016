`molecular' state of charmed $D$ and $D^*$ mesons, is likely to consist of two
peaks unequally coupled to the $D^{*+} \bar D^0$ and $D^+ \bar D^{*0}$
channels. The peaks should be split in mass by at least approximately 1.5 MeV.
This behavior arises from an enhancement of the effect of isospin violation in
the masses of the $D$ and $D^*$ mesons due to apparent suppression of forces
between the mesons depending on the spins of the heavy as well as of the light
quarks. The suggested double-peak structure can be studied either by direct
shape measurement in the channels with heavy mesons, or by isospin-violating
transitions from $Z_c^\pm(3885)$ to the states of charmonium plus a light
meson.

to become a white dwarf, these planets can be engulfed, triggering secular
instabilities and leading to the tidal disruptions of small rocky bodies. These
disrupted bodies can feed the white dwarfs with rocky material and possibly
explain the high-metallicity material in their atmospheres. We illustrate how
this mechanism can operate when the gravitational perturbations are due to the
Kozai-Lidov mechanism from a stellar binary companion. We show that this

engulfment happens fast compared to the secular timescale, which is generally
the case for wide binaries ($>100$ AU) and planetary engulfment during the
Asymptotic Giant Branch; (2) the planetesimal disk has a total mass of

tunneling leakage originating from the small band gap and small effective
masses of the InAs channel. As proposed in this article, this problem can be
significantly mitigated by reducing the channel thickness meanwhile retaining a
thick source-channel tunnel junction, thus forming a design with a non-uniform
body thickness. Because of the quantum confinement, the thin InAs channel
offers a large band gap and large effective masses, reducing the ambipolar and
source-to-drain tunneling leakage at OFF state. The thick GaSb/InAs tunnel
junction, instead, offers a low tunnel barrier and small effective masses,
allowing a large tunnel probability at ON state. In addition, the confinement
induced band discontinuity enhances the tunnel electric field and creates a
resonant state, further improving $I_{\rm{ON}}$. Atomistic quantum transport
simulations show that ballistic $I_{\rm{ON}}=284$A/m is obtained at 15nm
channel length, $I_{\rm{OFF}}=1\times10^{-3}$A/m, and $V_{\rm{DD}}=0.3$V. While
with uniform body thickness, the largest achievable $I_{\rm{ON}}$ is only
25A/m. Simulations also indicate that this design is scalable to sub-10nm

influence. From the analysis, it appears that the phase noise influence for the
two OFDM implementations is very similar. The software based system provides a
method for a rigorous evaluation of the phase noise variance caused by Common
Phase Error (CPE) and Inter-Carrier Interference (ICI) and this, in turns,
leads to a BER specification. Numerical results focus on a CO-OFDM system with
1GS/s QPSK channel modulation. Worst case BER results are evaluated and
compared to the BER of a QPSK system with the same capacity as the OFDM
implementation. Results are evaluated as a function of transmission distance,
and for the QPSK system the influence of equalization enhanced phase noise
(EEPN) is included. For both types of systems, the phase noise variance
increases significantly with increasing transmission distance. An important and
novel observation is that the two types of systems have very closely the same
BER as a function of transmission distance for the same capacity. For the high
capacity QPSK implementation, the increase in BER is due to EEPN, whereas for
the OFDM approach it is due to the dispersion caused walk-off of the RF pilot
tone relative to the OFDM signal channels. For a total capacity of 400 Gb/s,
the transmission distance to have the BER < 10-4 is less than 277 km.

gamma rays, extend $\approx$10 kpc vertically from the Galactic center, and
formed from either nuclear star formation or accretion activity on Sgr A*.
Simulations predict a range of shock strengths as the bubbles expand into the
surrounding hot gas halo distribution ($T_{halo} \approx 2 \times 10^6$ K), but
with significant uncertainties in the energetics, age, and thermal gas
structure. The bubbles should contain thermal gas with temperatures between
$10^6$ and $10^8$ K, with potential X-ray signatures. In this work, we
constrain the bubbles' thermal gas structure by modeling the OVII and OVIII
emission line strengths from archival XMM-Newton and Suzaku data. Our emission
model includes a hot thermal volume-filled bubble component cospatial with the
gamma-ray region, and a shell of compressed material. We find that a
bubble/shell model with $n \approx 1 \times 10^{-3}$ cm$^{-3}$ and with
log($T$) $\approx$ 6.60-6.70 is consistent with the observed line intensities.
In the framework of a continuous Galactic outflow, we infer a bubble expansion
rate, age, and energy injection rate of $490_{-77}^{+230}$ km s$^{-1}$,
$4.3_{-1.4}^{+0.8}$ Myr, and $2.3_{-0.9}^{+5.1} \times 10^{42}$ erg s$^{-1}$.
These estimates are consistent with the bubbles forming from a Sgr A* accretion
event rather than from nuclear star formation.

latency due to their computational overhead or a large set of correspondence
samples to search. To achieve real-time imitation with small latency, we
present a framework in this paper to reconstruct motion on humanoids based on
sparsely sampled correspondence. The imitation problem is formulated as finding
the projection of a point from the configuration space of a human's poses into
the configuration space of a humanoid. An optimal projection is defined as the
one that minimizes a back-projected deviation among a group of candidates,
which can be determined in a very efficient way. Benefited from this
formulation, effective projections can be obtained by using sparse
correspondence. Methods for generating these sparse correspondence samples have
also been introduced. Our method is evaluated by applying the human's motion
captured by a RGB-D sensor to a humanoid in real-time. Continuous motion can be
realized and used in the example application of tele-operation.

graph in $F$ is a vertex-induced subgraph of $U$. For the family of all
undirected graphs on $n$ vertices Alstrup, Kaplan, Thorup, and Zwick [STOC
2015] give an induced universal graph with $O\!\left(2^{n/2}\right)$ vertices,
matching a lower bound by Moon [Proc. Glasgow Math. Assoc. 1965].
  Let $k= \lceil D/2 \rceil$. Improving asymptotically on previous results by
Butler [Graphs and Combinatorics 2009] and Esperet, Arnaud and Ochem [IPL
2008], we give an induced universal graph with $O\!\left(\frac{k2^k}{k!}n^k
\right)$ vertices for the family of graphs with $n$ vertices of maximum degree
$D$. For constant $D$, Butler gives a lower bound of
$\Omega\!\left(n^{D/2}\right)$. For an odd constant $D\geq 3$, Esperet et al.
and Alon and Capalbo [SODA 2008] give a graph with
$O\!\left(n^{k-\frac{1}{D}}\right)$ vertices. Using their techniques for any
(including constant) even values of $D$ gives asymptotically worse bounds than
we present.
  For large $D$, i.e. when $D = \Omega\left(\log^3 n\right)$, the previous best
upper bound was ${n\choose\lceil D/2\rceil} n^{O(1)}$ due to Adjiashvili and
Rotbart [ICALP 2014]. We give upper and lower bounds showing that the size is
${\lfloor n/2\rfloor\choose\lfloor D/2

$2^{\tilde{O}(D)}$ and our construction is within a factor of
$2^{\tilde{O}\left(\sqrt{D}\right)}$ from this. The previous results were
larger by at least a factor of $2^{\Omega(D)}$.
  As a part of the above, proving a conjecture by Esperet et al., we construct
an induced universal graph with $2n-1$ vertices for the family of graphs with
max degree $2$. In addition, we give results for acyclic graphs with max degree
$2$ and cycle graphs. Our results imply the first labeling schemes that for any

GHz total intensity above 420 mJy from the S-band Polarization All Sky Survey,

Sky Survey, NVSS. We studied selection effects and found that fractional
polarization, $\pi$, of radio objects at both wavelengths depends on the
spectral index, source magnetic field disorder, source size and depolarization.
The relationship between depolarization, spectrum and size shows that
depolarization occurs primarily in the source vicinity. The median $\pi_{2.3}$
of resolved objects in NVSS is approximately two times larger than that of
unresolved sources. Sources with little depolarization are $\sim2$ times more
polarized than both highly depolarized and re-polarized sources. This indicates
that intrinsic magnetic field disorder is the dominant mechanism responsible
for the observed low fractional polarization of radio sources at high
frequencies. We predict that number counts from polarization surveys will be
similar at 1.4 GHz and at 2.3 GHz, for fixed sensitivity, although $\sim$10% of
all sources may be currently missing because of strong depolarization. Objects
with $\pi_{1.4}\approx \pi_{2.3} \ge 4\%$ typically have simple Faraday
structures, so are most useful for background samples. Almost half of flat
spectrum ($\alpha \ge -0.5$) and $\sim$25% of steep spectrum objects are
re-polarized. Steep spectrum, depolarized sources show a weak negative
correlation of depolarization with redshift in the range 0 $<$ z $<$ 2.3.
Previous non-detections of redshift evolution are likely due the inclusion of
re-polarized sources as well.

practical and theoretical difficulty in optimizing their parameters. The
seemingly unreasonable success of gradient descent methods in minimizing these

theoretical guarantees for networks with piecewise affine activation functions,
which have in recent years become the norm. We prove three main results.
Firstly, that the network is piecewise convex as a function of the input data.
Secondly, that the network, considered as a function of the parameters in a

that the network as a function of all its parameters is piecewise multi-convex,

stationary points of the training objective, showing that they minimize certain
subsets of the parameter space. We then analyze the performance of two
optimization algorithms on multi-convex problems: gradient descent, and a
method which repeatedly solves a number of convex sub-problems. We prove
necessary convergence conditions for the first algorithm and both necessary and
sufficient conditions for the second, after introducing regularization to the

Each of these models is uniform in that all edges have the same internal

generalize the concepts of Turan density, blowup density, and jumps to this

generalized directed hypergraph (GDH) has the same Turan density as the GDH

characterized as being contained in a blowup of a single edge. Additionally, we
show how the set of jumps from one kind of GDH relates to the set of jumps of
another. Since r-uniform hypergraphs are an instance of the defined class, then
we are able to derive many particular instances of jumps and nonjumps for GDHs

However, one major challenge is that the large amount of information required
to be transferred between each RRH and the central processor (CP) for joint
signal processing can easily exceed the capacity of the fronthaul links
connecting them. This motivates our study in this paper on a new hybrid
decoding scheme where in addition to quantizing and forwarding the received
signals for joint decoding at the CP, i.e. forward-and-decode (FaD) as in the
conventional CRAN, the RRHs can locally decode-and-forward (DaF) the user
messages to save the fronthaul capacity. In particular, we consider the uplink
transmission in an orthogonal frequency division multiple access (OFDMA)-based
UD-CRAN, where the proposed hybrid decoding is performed on each OFDMA
sub-channel (SC). We study a joint optimization of the processing mode
selections (DaF or FaD), user-SC assignments and the users' transmit power
allocations over all SCs to maximize their weighted-sum-rate subject to the
RRHs' individual fronthaul capacity constraints and the users' individual power

we propose a low-complexity greedy algorithm which is shown to achieve close to
the optimal performance under practical setups. Simulation results show the
promising throughput gains of the proposed designs with hybrid decoding,
compared to the existing schemes that perform either DaF or FaD at all SCs.

of SRC was proposed to overcome the limitations of SRC for remote sensing image

(OLS) has not yet been widely used in classifiers that exploit the sparse

more accurate signal estimation will further improve the classification
performance of classifiers that exploiting the sparsity of data. In this paper,
we present a classification method based on OLS, which implements OLS in a
classwise manner to perform the classification. We also develop and present its

semimetal within Born and self-consistent Born approximations. In the presence
of the charged impurities, the linear magnetoresistance can happen when the
charge carriers are mainly from the zeroth (n=0) Landau level. Interestingly,
the linear magnetoresistance is very robust against the change of temperature,
as long as the charge carriers mainly come from the zeroth Landau level. We
denote this parameter regime as the high-field regime. On the other hand, the
linear magnetoresistance disappears once the charge carriers from the higher
Landau levels can provide notable contributions. Our analysis indicates that
the deviation from the linear magnetoresistance is mainly due to the deviation
of the longitudinal conductivity from the $1/B$ behavior. We found two
important features of the self-energy approximation: 1. a dramatic jump of
$\sigma_{xx}$, when the $n=1$ Landau level begins to contribute charge
carriers, which is the beginning point of the middle-field regime, when
decreasing the external magnetic field from high field; 2. In the low-field
regime $\sigma_{xx}$ shows a $B^{-5/3}$ behavior and results the
magnetoresistance $\rho_{xx}$ to show a $B^{1/3}$ behavior. The detailed and
careful numerical calculation indicates that the self-energy approximation

executable files, and this code can be hard to detect, especially if encrypted
or compressed. However, when an executable file switches between code regimes
(e.g. native, encrypted, compressed, text, and padding), there are
corresponding shifts in the file's representation as an entropy signal. In this
paper, we develop a method for automatically quantifying the extent to which
patterned variations in a file's entropy signal make it ""suspicious."" In
Experiment 1, we use wavelet transforms to define a Suspiciously Structured
Entropic Change Score (SSECS), a scalar feature that quantifies the
suspiciousness of a file based on its distribution of entropic energy across
multiple levels of spatial resolution. Based on this single feature, it was
possible to raise predictive accuracy on a malware detection task from 50.0% to
68.7%, even though the single feature was applied to a heterogeneous corpus of
malware discovered ""in the wild."" In Experiment 2, we describe how
wavelet-based decompositions of software entropy can be applied to a parasitic
malware detection task involving large numbers of samples and features. By
extracting only string and entropy features (with wavelet decompositions) from
software samples, we are able to obtain almost 99% detection of parasitic
malware with fewer than 1% false positives on good files. Moreover, the
addition of wavelet-based features uniformly improved detection performance
across plausible false positive rates, both in a strings-only model (e.g., from

observations and numerical simulations. Indeed, we find that in a dissipative
viscous flow, shocks in presence of outflows can be produced only if the
Shakura-Sunyaev viscosity parameter {\alpha} is less than 0.2. This is a direct
consequence of modification of the Rankine-Hugoniot relation across the shock
in a viscous flow, when the energy dissipation and mass loss in the form of
outflows from the post-shock region are included. If we ignore the effects of
mass loss altogether, the standing dissipative shocks in viscous flows may
occur only if {\alpha} < 0.27. These limits are tighter than the absolute limit
of {\alpha} = 0.3 valid for a situation when the shock itself neither
dissipates energy nor any outflow is formed. We compute typical viscosity
parameters required to understand spectral and temporal properties of several
black hole candidates such as GX399-4, MAXI J1659-152 and MAXI J1836-194 and
find that required {\alpha} are indeed well within our prescribed limit.

  Scale Free Networks",,,,,"physics.soc-ph q-bio.PE","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In the present work the spread of epidemic is studied over complex networks
which are characterized by power law degree distribution of links and
heterogeneous rate of disease transmission. The random allocation of epidemic
transmission rates to the nodes results in the heterogeneity, which in turn
causes the segregation of nodes in terms of various sub populations. The aim of
the study is to gain microscopic insight into the effect of interactions among
various sub populations in the spreading processes of disease over such
networks. The discrete time Markov chain method based upon the susceptible
infected susceptible (SIS) model of diseases transmission has been used to
describe the spreading of epidemic over the networks. The study is
parameterized in terms of variable $\lambda$, defined as the number of contacts
a node makes with the fraction of its neighboring nodes. From the simulation
results, it is found that the spread of epidemic on such networks is critical
in terms of number of minimum contacts made by a node below which there is no
outbreak of disease. The degree of infection in these networks is assessed from
the size of epidemic defined in terms of fraction of infected nodes of the
total number and their corresponding level of infection. The results of the
parametric study demonstrates the dependence of the epidemic size upon number
of concurrent contacts made by a node ($\lambda$ ) and the average number of
links per node. In both these cases, the size of the epidemic is found to
increase with the corresponding increase in respective parameters.

orthogonally polarized intense fast sinusoidal beating within a normally

by the sinusoidal pump beam on the orthogonal weak signal through cross-phase
modulation turns the defocusing regime into localized temporal focusing
effects. This periodic focusing is then responsible for the generation of a
high-repetition-rate temporal comb upon the incident signal whose amplitude is

show that compressive or tensile strain can induce conduction band minimum

can induce significantly enhanced n- or p-type Seebeck coefficient at the

strain-induced band convergence. Another essential strain effect is that
tensile strain can produce significantly reduced lattice thermal conductivity,

methods are based on complicated spectral techniques or convex optimisation,
and cannot be applied directly for clustering many networks that occur in
practice, whose information is often collected on different sites. Designing a
simple and distributed clustering algorithm is of great interest, and has wide
applications for processing big datasets. In this paper we present a simple and

characterised by a strong cluster-structure, our algorithm finishes in a

local converging flows are observed beneath the forming sunspots. These flows
are most prominent in the depth range 1-3 Mm, and remain converging after the
formation process is completed. On the larger scale converging flows around
active region appear as a diversion of the zonal shearing flows towards the
active region, accompanied by formation of a large-scale vortex structure. This
process occurs when a substantial amount of the magnetic flux emerged on the
surface, and the converging flow pattern remains stable during the following
evolution of the active region. The Carrington synoptic flow maps show that the
large-scale subsurface inflows are typical for active regions. In the deeper
layers (10-13 Mm) the flows become diverging, and surprisingly strong beneath
some active regions. In addition, the synoptic maps reveal a complex evolving
pattern of large-scale flows on the scale much larger than supergranulation.

increasingly important in many applications and have attracted a lot of
attentions in recent years. In this paper, we study two important geometric
optimization problems, the $k$-center problem and the $j$-flat-center problem,
over stochastic/uncertain data points in Euclidean spaces. For the stochastic
$k$-center problem, we would like to find $k$ points in a fixed dimensional
Euclidean space, such that the expected value of the $k$-center objective is
minimized. For the stochastic $j$-flat-center problem, we seek a $j$-flat
(i.e., a $j$-dimensional affine subspace) such that the expected value of the
maximum distance from any point to the $j$-flat is minimized. We consider both
problems under two popular stochastic geometric models, the existential
uncertainty model, where the existence of each point may be uncertain, and the
locational uncertainty model, where the location of each point may be
uncertain. We provide the first PTAS (Polynomial Time Approximation Scheme) for
both problems under the two models. Our results generalize the previous results
for stochastic minimum enclosing ball and stochastic enclosing cylinder.

samples for the purpose of estimating the mean or the integral of a function of

a tuning parameter $r>0$ that permits to control the likeliness of jointly
selecting neighbor units in a same sample. When $r$ is large, units that are
close tend to not be selected together and samples are well spread. When $r$
tends to infinity, the sampling design is close to systematic sampling. For all
$r > 0$, the first and second-order unit inclusion densities are positive,
allowing for unbiased estimators of variance.
  Algorithms to generate these sampling processes for any positive real value
of $r$ are presented. When $r$ is large, the estimator of variance is unstable.
It follows that $r$ must be chosen by the practitioner as a trade-off between
an accurate estimation of the target parameter and an accurate estimation of
the variance of the parameter estimator. The method's advantages are

evaluate how well forward fitting techniques perform in determining $\tau$. We
investigate the systematic errors in $\tau$ associated with the use of an

radio flux density can be normalized to the flux density of the extended lobe
emission to infer the orientation of a radio source. However very little is
known about the reliability and precision of this method, and we are unaware of
any robust conversion recipe to infer the inclination from the core dominance.
Investigating whether or not the radio core dominance parameter R separates the
quasars from the radio-galaxies in the $z \ge$~1 3CRR catalog, we found
excellent agreement of R with optical type, infrared flux ratios and optical
polarization. This indicates that probably both R and optical classification
are very good orientation indicators, and the unified model is strongly
predictive for these objects. The relative number densities indicate
half-opening angles close to 60$^\circ$, as expected from large surveys. The
separations of optical types according to radio core dominance as well as
NIR/MIR ratios, which are essentially perfect, means that there can be only a
small dispersion of torus half-opening angles. Also, even though torus dust is
thought to be clumpy, there is an almost zero probability to see a type-1
source at high inclination. Finally, using only the Copernican Principle, i,e,
the assumption that solid angle is filled uniformly with source axis
orientations, we estimated a semi-empirical relation between core dominance and
AGN inclination. This makes it possible to use R to infer the inclination of a
source to an accuracy of $\sim$ 10 degrees or less, at least for this type of
object.

further has a tightly linear relation with the Doppler factor. It is more
interesting that this relation is consistent with the scenario that the black
hole mass governs both the bulk Lorentz factor and the synchrotron peak
frequency. In addition, the distinction of the kinetic jet powers between BL
Lacs and FSRQs disappears after the boosting factor $\delta^2$ is considered.
The negative correlation between the peak frequency and the observational
isotropic luminosity, known as the blazar sequence, also disappears after the

the inverse-Gaussianization method, based on the finding that a lensing
convergence field can be Gaussianized to excellent accuracy by a local
transformation [Yu et al, Phys. Rev. D 84, 023523 (2011)]. Given a simulation,
it enables us to produce as many as infinite statistically independent lensing
maps as fast as producing the simulation initial conditions. The proposed
method is tested against simulations for each tomography bin centered at lens
redshift $z \sim 0.5$, 1, and 2, with various statistics. We find that the
lensing maps generated by our method have reasonably accurate power spectra,
bispectra, and power spectrum covariance matrix. Therefore, it will be useful
for weak lensing surveys to generate realistic mocks. As an example of
application, we measure the probability distribution function of the lensing
power spectrum, from 16384 lensing maps produced by the inverse-Gaussianization
method.

that are involved are at the limit of extreme (cuasi-singular) concentration of
intensity and the transversal modulational instability, the saturation and
defocusing effect of the plasma generated through avalanche and multi-photon
(MPI) ionization are competing leading to a complicated pattern of intensity in
the transversal plane. This regime has been named \textquotedblleft optical
turbulence\textquotedblright and it has been studied in experiments and
numerical simulations. Led by the similarity of the portraits we have
investigated the possibility that the mechanism that underlies the creation of
the complex pattern of the intensity field is the manifestation of the dynamics
\textit{activator-inhibitor}. In a previous work we have considered a unique
connection, the \textit{complex Landau-Ginzburg equation}, a common ground for
the nonlinear Schrodinger equation (optical propagation) and reaction-diffusion
systems (activator-inhibitor). The present work is a continuation of this
investigation. We start from the exact integrability of the elementary
self-focusing propagation (\textit{gas Chaplygin with anomalous polytropic})
and show that the analytical model for the intensity can be extended on
physical basis to include the potential barrier separating two states of
equilibria and the drive due to competing Kerr and MPI nonlinearities. We
underline the variational structure and calculate the width of a branch of the
cluster of high intensity (when it is saturated at a finite value). Our result
is smaller but satisfactorily in the range of the experimental observations.

wall-bounded shear flow, this structure is linearly stable if the idealization
of laminar flow is made. Lacking an instability, the large transient growth of
the roll/streak structure has been invoked to explain its appearance as
resulting from chance occurrence in the free-stream turbulence (FST) of
perturbations configured to optimally excite it. However, there is an
alternative interpretation which is that FST interacts with the roll/streak
structure to destabilize it. Statistical state dynamics (SSD) provides analysis
methods for studying instabilities of this type which arise from interaction
between the coherent and incoherent components of turbulence. Stochastic
structural stability theory (S3T), which implements SSD in the form of a
closure at second order, is used to analyze the SSD modes arising from
interaction between the coherent streamwise invariant component and the
incoherent FST component of turbulence. The least stable S3T mode is
destabilized at a critical value of a parameter controlling FST intensity and a
finite amplitude roll/streak structure arises from this instability through a
bifurcation in this parameter. Although this bifurcation has analytical
expression only in SSD, it is closely reflected in both the dynamically similar
quasi-linear system, referred to as the restricted non-linear (RNL) system, and
in DNS. S3T also predicts a second bifurcation at a higher value of the
turbulent excitation parameter. This second bifurcation is shown to lead to
transition to turbulence. Bifurcation from a finite amplitude roll/streak
equilibrium provides a direct route to the turbulent state through the S3T
roll/streak instability.

self-sustain turbulence with a mean flow and second order perturbation
structure similar to that obtained by DNS. The use of a SSD model to study the
physical mechanisms underlying turbulence has advantages over the traditional
approach of studying the dynamics of individual realizations of turbulence. One
advantage is that the analytical structure of SSD isolates and directly
expresses the interaction between the coherent mean flow and the incoherent
perturbation components of the turbulence. Isolation of the interaction between
these components reveals how this interaction underlies both the maintenance of
the turbulence variance by transfer of energy from the externally driven flow
to the perturbation components as well as the enforcement of the observed
statistical mean turbulent state by feedback regulation between the mean and
perturbation fields. Another advantage of studying turbulence using SSD models
is that the analytical structure of S3T turbulence can be completely
characterized. For example, turbulence in the S3T system is maintained by a
parametric growth mechanism. Furthermore, the equilibrium statistical state of
the turbulence can be demonstrated to be enforced by feedback regulation in
which transient growth of the incoherent perturbations episodically suppresses
coherent streak growth preventing runaway parametric growth of the incoherent
turbulent component. Using S3T to isolate these parametric growth and feedback
regulation mechanisms allows a detailed characterization of the dynamics of the
self-sustaining process in S3T turbulence with compelling implications for
understanding the mechanism of wall-turbulence.

well known that the eigenstates of the Aubry-Andr\'e model are either extended

less or bigger than a critical value $V_c$, and thus no mobility edge exists.
However, it was shown in a recent work that this conclusion does not hold true
when the wave vector $\alpha$ of the incommensurate potential is small, and for
the system with $V<V_c$, there exist almost mobility edges at the energy
$E_{c_{\pm}}$, which separate the robustly delocalized states from ""almost

additionally another energy edges $E_{c'_{\pm}}$, at which abrupt change of

$SU(N)$, for which we verified numerically that it is polynomially exact for
$N\le 3$. The method is applied to the example of 1-dimensional QCD with a
chemical potential. We explore, in particular, regions of the parameter space
in which the sign problem appears due the presence of the chemical potential.
While Markov Chain Monte Carlo fails in this region, our new integration method
still provides results for the chiral condensate on arbitrary precision,
demonstrating clearly that it overcomes the sign problem. Furthermore, we
demonstrate that our new method leads to orders of magnitude reduced errors
also in other regions of parameter space.

  Solution through Behavlets-based General Player Modelling","8 pages, 1 figure",,,,"cs.HC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We present the last of a series of three academic essays which deal with the
question of how and why to build a generalized player model. We propose that a
general player model needs parameters for subjective experience of play,
including: player psychology, game structure, and actions of play. Based on
this proposition, we pose three linked research questions: RQ1 what is a
necessary and sufficient foundation to a general player model?; RQ2 can such a
foundation improve performance of a computational intelligence- based player
model?; and RQ3 can such a player model improve efficacy of adaptive artificial
intelligence in games?
  We set out the arguments behind these research questions in each of the three
essays, presented as three preprints. The third essay, in this preprint,
presents the argument that adaptive game artificial intelligence will be
enhanced by a generalised player model. This is because games are inherently
human artefacts which therefore, require some encoding of the human perspective
in order to effectively autonomously respond to the individual player. The
player model informs the necessary constraints on the adaptive artificial
intelligence. A generalised player model is not only more efficient than a
per-game solution, but also allows comparison between games which makes it a
useful tool for studying play in general. We describe the concept and meaning
of an adaptive game. We propose requirements for functional adaptive AI,
arguing from first principles drawn from the games research literature. We
propose solutions to these requirements, based on a formal model approach to
our existing 'Behavlets' method for psychologically-derived player modelling:

Arabic text (MS Ankara, Saib 199) together with our translation and
interpretation: Abu Mashar reported that he had observed Venus in (or projected
onto) the tail of a comet and concluded that the comet was behind Venus,
because he had observed the extinction of Venus due to the cometary tail to be
negligible (light of Venus was unimpaired). He then concluded that the comet
would be located behind Venus. He also mentioned that others had observed
Jupiter and Saturn in cometary tails, so that those comets would even be
located beyond those two outer planets - in the sphere of the stars. The dates
of the observed close conjunctions were not mentioned; using known orbital
elements for a few comets, we found a few close conjunctions between comets and
planets from A.D. 770 to 868, but we cannot be sure regarding which
conjunctions were reported. While the argument of Abu Mashar is not correct (as
cometary tails are optically thin), parts of the conclusion - namely that
comets are outside the Earth atmosphere and beyond the moon - is correct. This
may have helped Tycho Brahe to come to his revolutionary conclusion.

communication scheme, leveraging an interesting robustness against packet
losses. However, it suffers from a high computational complexity and some novel
approaches, which follow the same idea, have been recently proposed. One of
such solutions is Tunable Sparse Network Coding (TSNC), where only few packets
are combined in each transmissions. The amount of data packets to be combined
in each transmissions can be set from a density parameter/distribution, which
could be eventually adapted. In this work we present an analytical model that
captures the performance of SNC on an accurate way. We exploit an absorbing
Markov process where the states are defined by the number of useful packets
received by the decoder, i.e the decoding matrix rank, and the number of
non-zero columns at such matrix. The model is validated by means of a thorough
simulation campaign, and the difference between model and simulation is
negligible. A mean square error less than $4 \cdot 10^{-4}$ in the worst cases.
We also include in the comparison some of more general bounds that have been
recently used, showing that their accuracy is rather poor. The proposed model
would enable a more precise assessment of the behavior of sparse network coding
techniques. The last results show that the proposed analytical model can be
exploited by the TSNC techniques in order to select by the encoder the best
density as the transmission evolves.

three-dimensional (3-D) coverage. Our solution draws from molecular geometry,
where forces among electron pairs surrounding a central atom arrange their
positions. In this paper, we propose a 3-D clustering algorithm for autonomous
positioning (VBCA) of aerial drone networks based on virtual forces. These
virtual forces induce interactions among drones and structure the system
topology. The advantages of our approach are that (1) virtual forces enable
drones to self-organize the positioning process and (2) VBCA can be implemented
entirely localized. Extensive simulations show that our virtual forces
clustering approach produces scalable 3-D topologies exhibiting near-optimal
volume coverage. VBCA triggers efficient topology rearrangement for an altering
number of nodes, while providing network connectivity to the central drone. We
also draw a comparison of volume coverage achieved by VBCA against existing
approaches and find VBCA up to 40\% more efficient.

identified reliable driving source candidates for three quarters of the
detected outflows, 40% of which are associated with groups and clusters of

CTTSs. We also identified 15 new star cluster candidates near MHOs in the

  We find that the typical outflow identified in the sample has the following
characteristics: the position angles are randomly orientated; bipolar outflows
are straight within a few degrees; the two lobes are slightly asymmetrical in
length and brightness; the length and brightness of the lobes are not
correlated; typical time gaps between major ejections of material are 1-3kyr,
hence FU-Ori or EX-Ori eruptions are most likely not the cause of these, but we
suggest MNors as a possible source. Furthermore, we find that outflow lobe
length distributions are statistically different from the widely used total
length distributions. There are a larger than expected number of bright
outflows indicating that the flux distribution does not follow a power law.

unanswered. To bridge this gap, I propose to look beyond the two dominating
schools of thought and ask the following three questions: what do scientists
need out of statistics, do the existing frameworks meet these needs, and, if
not, how to fill the void? To the first question, I contend that scientists
seek to convert their data, posited statistical model, etc., into calibrated
degrees of belief about quantities of interest. To the second question, I argue
that any framework that returns additive beliefs, i.e., probabilities,
necessarily suffers from {\em false confidence}---certain false hypotheses tend
to be assigned high probability---and, therefore, risks systematic bias. This
reveals the fundamental importance of {\em non-additive beliefs} in the context
of statistical inference. But non-additivity alone is not enough so, to the
third question, I offer a sufficient condition, called {\em validity}, for
avoiding false confidence, and present a framework, based on random sets and
belief functions, that provably meets this condition. Finally, I discuss
characterizations of p-values and confidence intervals in terms of valid
non-additive beliefs, which imply that users of these classical procedures are
already following the proposed framework without knowing it.

in the 0.1--10 GeV range. In the soft state, we have found only upper limits on
the emission at energies $\gtrsim$0.1 MeV. However, we have found emission with
a very soft spectrum in the 40--80 MeV range, not detected previously. This is
likely to represent the high-energy cutoff of the high-energy power-law tail
observed in the soft state. Similarly, we have detected a $\gamma$-ray soft
excess in the hard state, which appears to be of similar origin. We have also
confirmed the presence of an orbital modulation of the detected emission in the
hard state, expected if the $\gamma$-rays are from Compton upscattering of
stellar blackbody photons. However, the observed modulation is significantly
weaker than that predicted if the blackbody upscattering were the dominant
source of $\gamma$-rays. This argues for a significant contribution from
$\gamma$-rays produced by the synchrotron-self-Compton process. We have found
that such strong contribution is possible if the jet is strongly clumped. We
reproduce the observed hard-state average broad-band spectrum using a
self-consistent jet model, taking into account all the relevant emission
processes, e$^\pm$ pair absorption, and clumping. This model also reproduces
the amplitude of the observed orbital modulation.

atom-cavity coupling strength increases, the system undergoes multiple
transitions in the photon statistics. In particular, a first sharp
anti-bunching to bunching transition, occurring at $g\sim0.45\omega_c$, leading
to the breakdown of the photon blockade due to the counter-rotating terms, is
shown to be the consequence of a parity shift in the energy spectrum. A
subsequent revival of the photon blockade and the emergence of the

interplay between the nonlinearity in the energy spectrum and the transition
rates between the dressed states.

a remarkably tight ensemble of nine galaxies, the spectra of which resemble
those of passive red ellipticals, embedded within a diffuse stellar halo of
$\sim$1~arcmin size. This system (named the `Zwicky's Nonet') provides unique
and compelling evidence for a multiple-nucleus cD galaxy precursor.
Multifrequency radio observations of 4C~35.06 with the Giant Meterwave Radio
Telescope (GMRT) at 610, 235 and 150 MHz reveal a system of 400~kpc scale
helically twisted and kinked radio jets and outer diffuse lobes. The outer
extremities of jets contain extremely steep spectrum (spectral index -1.7 to
-2.5) relic/fossil radio plasma with a spectral age of a few$\,\times (10^7 -
10^8)$ yr. Such ultra-steep spectrum relic radio lobes without definitive
hot-spots are rare, and they provide an opportunity to understand the
life-cycle of relativistic jets and physics of black hole mergers in dense
environments. We interpret our observations of this radio source in the context
of the growth of its central black hole, triggering of its AGN activity and jet
precession, all possibly caused by galaxy mergers in this dense galactic
system. A slow conical precession of the jet axis due to gravitational
perturbation between interacting black holes is invoked to explain the unusual

choices are influenced by psychological factors like impulsiveness, and
secondly, some consumers may be more susceptible to making impulse purchases
than others. To the best of our knowledge, the impact of personality factors on
advertisements has been largely neglected at the level of recommender systems.
This work proposes a highly innovative research which uses a personality

The observations were performed at 14.4 GHz and 43.1 GHz, and enable us to

close-by sources between the two epochs, which imply drifts in the jet cores of
approximately a few tens of micro-as per year. These results have implications

Particular focus is given to use of a uniaxial substrate with an arbitrarily
aligned optic axis. Competing red and blue resonance shifts ($\sim 30$ MHz),
deriving from generation of a near field material polarisation and back action

shifts can hence be observed depending on the substrate material, whereas mode
broadening on the order of $\sim 50$ MHz can also be simply realised.
Furthermore, polarisation selective coupling with extinction ratios of $> 10^4$

and their optic axes are chosen correctly. Double refraction and properties of
out-coupled beams are also discussed.

and a slow precession of said plane relative to the total angular momentum
vector of the Solar System, including planet 9. Under some specific
configurations for planet 9, this precession can explain the current tilt of
approximately 6 degrees between the invariant plane of the giant planets and
the solar equator. An analytical model is developed to map the evolution of the
inclination of the inner giant planets' invariant plane as a function of the
planet 9's mass, inclination, eccentricity and semimajor axis, and some
numerical simulations of the equations of motion of the giant planets and

uncapacitated minimum cost flow - up to a multiplicative error of $1 +
\varepsilon$ in undirected graphs with non-negative edge weights using a
tailored gradient descent algorithm. Using $\tilde{O}(\cdot)$ to hide
polylogarithmic factors in $n$ (the number of nodes in the graph), our gradient
descent algorithm takes $\tilde O(\varepsilon^{-2})$ iterations, and in each
iteration it solves an instance of the transshipment problem up to a
multiplicative error of $\operatorname{polylog} n$. In particular, this allows
us to perform a single iteration by computing a solution on a sparse spanner of
logarithmic stretch. Using a randomized rounding scheme, we can further extend
the method to finding approximate solutions for the single-source shortest
paths (SSSP) problem. As a consequence, we improve upon prior work by obtaining
the following results: (1) Broadcast CONGEST model: $(1 +
\varepsilon)$-approximate SSSP using $\tilde{O}((\sqrt{n} +
D)\varepsilon^{-3})$ rounds, where $ D $ is the (hop) diameter of the network.
(2) Broadcast congested clique model: $(1 + \varepsilon)$-approximate
transshipment and SSSP using $\tilde{O}(\varepsilon^{-2})$ rounds. (3)
Multipass streaming model: $(1 + \varepsilon)$-approximate transshipment and
SSSP using $\tilde{O}(n)$ space and $\tilde{O}(\varepsilon^{-2})$ passes. The
previously fastest SSSP algorithms for these models leverage sparse hop sets.
We bypass the hop set construction; computing a spanner is sufficient with our
method. The above bounds assume non-negative edge weights that are polynomially
bounded in $n$; for general non-negative weights, running times scale with the
logarithm of the maximum ratio between non-zero weights.

considers one sparse channel component. For each channel component, we first
reliably detect its support by utilizing the structural characteristics of
mmWave beamspace channel. Then, the influence of this channel component is
removed from the total beamspace channel estimation problem. After the supports
of all channel components have been detected, the nonzero elements of the

extensions of the Standard Model and of General Relativity, and are
well-motivated candidates to explain the dark components of the Universe. One
of most promising channels to look for their presence is through their
gravitational interaction with compact objects. Within this context, in this
thesis I study several mechanisms by which bosonic fields may affect the
dynamics and structure of black holes and neutron stars. The first part of the
thesis is devoted to the study of massive spin-2 fields around spherically
symmetric black-hole spacetimes. Massive spin-2 fields can be consistently
described within theories of massive gravity, making it possible to perform a
systematic study of the propagation of these fields in curved spacetimes. In
particular, I show that due to the presence of additional degrees of freedom in
these theories, the structure of black-hole solutions is richer than in General
Relativity. In the second part of the thesis, I discuss in detail superradiant
instabilities in the context of black-hole physics. I show that several
mechanisms, such as massive bosonic fields and magnetic fields, can turn
spinning black holes unstable against superradiant modes, which has important
implications for astrophysics and for physics beyond the Standard Model. In the
last part of this thesis, I present a study of how bosonic dark matter
condensates interact gravitationally with compact stars. In particular, I show

condensate exist and can describe the late stages of dark matter accretion onto
