track of the mutual expectations between words. Current DSMs, however,
represent context words as separate features, thereby loosing important
information for word expectations, such as word interrelations. In this paper,
we present a DSM that addresses this issue by defining verb contexts as joint
syntactic dependencies. We test our representation in a verb similarity task on
two datasets, showing that joint contexts achieve performances comparable to
single dependencies or even better. Moreover, they are able to overcome the
data sparsity problem of joint feature spaces, in spite of the limited size of

using Social Media (e.g., Social Media Question Asking, SMQA) or Social
Information Retrieval approaches, this paper tries to identify types of
information needs which are inherently social and therefore better suited for
those techniques. We describe an experiment where prominent websites from
various content categories are used to represent their respective content area
and allow to correlate attributes of the content areas. The underlying
assumption is that successful websites for focused content areas perfectly
align with the information seekers' requirements when satisfying information
needs in the respective content areas. Based on a manually collected dataset of
URLs from websites covering a broad range of topics taken from Alexa
(http://www.alexa.com} (retrieved 2015-11-04)) (a company that publishes
statistics about web traffic), a crowdsourcing approach is employed to rate the
information needs that could get solved by the respective URLs according to
several dimensions (incl. sociality and mobility) to investigate possible
correlations with other attributes. Our results suggest that information needs
which do not require a certain formal expertise play an important role in
social information retrieval and that some content areas are better suited for
social information retrieval (e.g., Factual Knowledge & News, Games, Lifestyle)
than others (e.g., Health & Lifestyle).

conductivity of $Sc_2O_3$ solely due to the presence of intrinsic defects in
the cathode operating environment is unlikely to be high enough to maintain the
magnitude of emitted current densities obtained from experiment, and that
presence of impurities are necessary to raise the conductivity of $Sc_2O_3$ to

Glass Condensate formalism using the $k_T$ - factorization formula, which was
derived at fixed coupling constant considering the scattering of a dilute
system of partons with a dense one. Recent analysis demonstrated that this
approach provides a satisfactory description of the experimental data for the
inclusive hadron production in $pp/pA/AA$ collisions. However, these studies
are based on the fixed coupling $k_T$ - factorization formula, which does not
take into account the running coupling corrections, which are important to set
the scales present in the cross section. In this paper we consider the running
coupling corrected $k_T$ - factorization formula conjectured some years ago and
investigate the impact of the running coupling corrections on the observables.
In particular, the pseudorapidity distributions and charged hadrons
multiplicity are calculated considering $pp$, $dAu/pPb$ and $AuAu/PbPb$
collisions at RHIC and LHC energies. We compare the corrected running coupling
predictions with those obtained using the original $k_T$ - factorization
assuming a fixed coupling or a prescription for the inclusion of the running of
the coupling. Considering the Kharzeev - Levin - Nardi unintegrated gluon
distribution and a simplified model for the nuclear geometry, we demonstrate
that the distinct predictions are similar for the pseudorapidity distributions

Such solutions can be treated as quantum mechanical wave functions describing

  Manchester. Accepted by IJCV",,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Zero-shot learning for visual recognition, e.g., object and action
recognition, has recently attracted a lot of attention. However, it still
remains challenging in bridging the semantic gap between visual features and
their underlying semantics and transferring knowledge to semantic categories
unseen during learning. Unlike most of the existing zero-shot visual
recognition methods, we propose a stagewise bidirectional latent embedding
framework to two subsequent learning stages for zero-shot visual recognition.
In the bottom-up stage, a latent embedding space is first created by exploring
the topological and labeling information underlying training data of known
classes via a proper supervised subspace learning algorithm and the latent
embedding of training data are used to form landmarks that guide embedding
semantics underlying unseen classes into this learned latent space. In the
top-down stage, semantic representations of unseen-class labels in a given
label vocabulary are then embedded to the same latent space to preserve the
semantic relatedness between all different classes via our proposed
semi-supervised Sammon mapping with the guidance of landmarks. Thus, the
resultant latent embedding space allows for predicting the label of a test
instance with a simple nearest-neighbor rule. To evaluate the effectiveness of
the proposed framework, we have conducted extensive experiments on four
benchmark datasets in object and action recognition, i.e., AwA, CUB-200-2011,
UCF101 and HMDB51. The experimental results under comparative studies
demonstrate that our proposed approach yields the state-of-the-art performance
under inductive and transductive settings.

Amorphous aggregation of {\gamma}-crystallins in the eye lens causes a

to study the mechanism of aggregation of two {\gamma}D-crystallin mutants, W42R

age-related oxidative damage. We found that formation of an internal disulfide
was necessary and sufficient for aggregation under physiological conditions.
Two-chain all-atom simulations predicted that one non-native disulfide in

intermediate prone to intermolecular interactions. Mass spectrometry and
mutagenesis experiments confirmed the presence of this bond in the aggregates
and its necessity for oxidative aggregation under physiological conditions in

extrusion of the N-terminal \b{eta}-hairpin and rearrangement of the native
\b{eta}-sheet topology. Specific binding between the extruded hairpin and a
distal \b{eta}-sheet, in an intermolecular chain reaction similar to domain
swapping, is the most probable mechanism of aggregate propagation.

leads us to consider totally ordered and measured trees, abbreviated as TOM

some mild conditions, every compact TOM tree can be represented in a unique way
by a so-called contour function, which is right-continuous, admits limits from
the left and has non-negative jumps. The appropriate notion of contour function
is also studied in the case of locally compact TOM trees. Then we study the
splitting property of (measures on) TOM trees which extends the notion of
`splitting tree' studied in \cite{MR2599603}, where during her lifetime, each
individual gives birth at constant rate to independent and identically
distributed copies of herself. We prove that the contour function of a TOM tree
satisfying the splitting property is associated to a spectrally positive L\'evy
process that is not a subordinator, both in the critical and subcritical cases
of compact trees as well as in the supercritical case of locally compact trees.

very near and very far from the Horizon of a de Sitter Universe, using the

averaged inside two boxes of volume $V$ in different spatial positions such
that it acquires the structure of a bipartite Quantum Harmonic Oscillator, for
which the PPT criterion is a necessary but not sufficient condition of
separability. Entanglement is found between states obtained from boxes shaped
as spherical shells with thickness of the order of one Planck distance ($l_p$),
when one of the states is near the Horizon, and the other state is anywhere in
the Universe. Entanglement disappears when the distance of the state near the
horizon and the Horizon increases to around $5l_p$. If we consider the Horizon
not as a surface but as a spherical shell of thickness $l_p$, then this means
that there is entanglement between the states in the Horizon and the rest of
the Universe. When both states are at distances larger than $\sim 5 l_p$ from

along a vapor/liquid inter- face show an unexpected decrease in diffusivity, or
increase in surface drag (from the Stokes-Einstein relation) when the particles
situate further into the vapor phase. However, direct measurements of the
surface drag from the colloid velocity due to an external force find the
expected decrease with deeper immersion into the vapor. The paradoxical drag
increase observed in diffusion experiments has been attributed to the
attachment of the fluid interface to heterogeneities on the colloid surface,
which causes the interface, in response to thermal fluctuations, to either jump
or remain pinned, creating added drag. We have performed molecular dynamics
simulations of the diffusivity and force experiments for a nanoparticle with a
rough surface at a vapor/liquid interface to examine the effect of contact line
fluctuations. The drag calculated from both experiments agree and decrease as
the particle positions further into the vapor. The surface drag is smaller than
the bulk liquid drag due to the partial submersion into the liquid, and the
finite thickness of the interfacial zone relative to the nanoparticle size.
Contact line fluctuations do not give rise to an anomalous increase in drag.

science goals, that is, small angular scale CMB measurements, B-mode
measurements and cross-correlation studies. For the ACTPol survey we have
observed patches of the southern galactic sky with low galactic foreground
emissions which were also chosen to maximize the overlap with several galaxy
surveys to allow unique cross-correlation studies. A wider field in the
northern galactic cap ensured significant additional overlap with the BOSS
spectroscopic survey. The exact shapes and footprints of the fields were
optimized to achieve uniform coverage and to obtain cross-linked maps by
observing the fields with different scan directions. We have maximized the
efficiency of the survey by implementing a close to 24 hour observing strategy,
switching between daytime and nighttime observing plans and minimizing the
telescope idle time. We describe the challenges represented by the survey
optimization for the significantly wider area observed by AdvACT, which will

morphology or, above a certain threshold liquid volume fraction, a bulge
coexisting with a rouloid-like section. The corresponding melting points are
different. The analysis explicitly describes the behavior of a real system of
small aggregates of long chain alkanes on planar substrates. It also gives
qualitative insights into the melting behavior of small aggregates with
anisotropic wetting behaviors in general. It reveals in particular how melting
points and melting pathways depend on the energetic respectively morphological

promising method for high-voltage cathode stabilization in Li-ion batteries.
However, there is still substantial uncertainty about how these films function,
specifically with regard to important coating design principles such as lithium
solubility and transport through the films. This study uses Density Functional
Theory to examine the diffusivity of interstitial lithium in crystalline
{\alpha}-$AlF_3$, {\alpha}-$Al_2O_3$, m-$ZrO_2$, c-MgO, and {\alpha}-quartz
$SiO_2$, which provide benchmark cases for further understanding of insulator
coatings in general. In addition, we propose an Ohmic electrolyte model to
predict resistivities and overpotential contributions under battery operating
conditions. For the crystalline materials considered we predict that Li+
diffuses quite slowly, with a migration barrier larger than 0.9 eV in all
crystalline materials except {\alpha}-quartz $SiO_2$, which is predicted to
have a migration barrier of 0.276 eV along <001>. These results suggest that
the stable crystalline forms of these insulator materials, except for oriented
{\alpha}-quartz $SiO_2$, are not practical for conformal cathode coatings.
Amorphous $Al_2O_3$ and $AlF_3$ have higher Li+ diffusivities than their
crystalline counterparts. Our predicted amorphous $Al_2O_3$ resistivity (1789
M{\Omega}m) is near the top of the range of fitted resistivities extracted from
previous experiments on nominal $Al_2O_3$ coatings (7.8 to 913 M{\Omega}m)
while our predicted amorphous $AlF_3$ resistivity (114 M{\Omega}m) is close to
the middle of the range. These comparisons support our framework for modeling
and understanding the impact on overpotential of conformal coatings in terms of
their fundamental thermodynamic and kinetic properties, and support that these
materials can provide practical conformal coatings in their amorphous form.

results reveal that, contrary to conventional belief, the phase evolution in
the electrode is symmetrical during discharge and charge. However, the spatial
evolution of the electrochemically active phases, which is controlled by
reaction kinetics, is different. We further propose that the voltage hysteresis
in the $FeF_3$ electrode is kinetic in nature. It is the result of Ohmic
voltage drop, reaction overpotential, and different spatial distributions of
electrochemically-active phases (i.e. compositional inhomogeneity). Therefore,
the large hysteresis can be expected to be mitigated by rational design and
optimization of material microstructure and electrode architecture to improve

and cooling is therefore inefficient (t_{cool} \Omega >> 1). In this regime
angular momentum transport in the disk leads to steady heating unless \alpha <
(t_{cool} \Omega)^{-1} << 1. Following earlier work by Charnoz and Michaut, and
Carballido et al., we show that once the disk is completely vaporized it is
well coupled to the magnetic field. We consider a scenario in which turbulence
driven by magnetic fields leads to a brief, hot phase where the disk is
geometrically thick, wit h strong turbulent mixing. The disk cools by spreading
until it decouples from the field. We point out that approximately half the
accretion energy is dissipated in the boundary layer where the disk meets the
Earth's surface. This creates high entropy material close to the Earth, driving
convection and mixing. Finally, a hot, magnetized disk could drive bipolar
outflows that remove mass and angular momentum from the Earth-Moon system.

number of ideas about its source. Furthermore, observations of fast radio
bursts (FRBs) have similarly resulted in a range of new models that might endow
black hole binaries with electromagnetic signatures. In this context, even the
unlikely idea that astrophysical black holes may have significant charge is
worth exploring, and here we present results from the simulation of weakly
charged black holes as they orbit and merge. Our simulations suggest that a
black hole binary with mass comparable to that observed in GW150914 could
produce the level of electromagnetic luminosity observed by Fermi GBM
($10^{49}$ ergs/s) with a non-dimensional charge of $q \equiv Q/M = 10^{-4}$
assuming good radiative efficiency. However even a charge such as this is
difficult to imagine avoiding neutralization long enough for the binary to
produce its electromagnetic counterpart, and so this value would likely serve
simply as an upper bound. On the other hand, one can equivalently consider the
black holes as having acquired a magnetic monopole charge that would be easy to
maintain and would generate an identical electromagnetic signature as the
electric charges. The observation of such a binary would have significant
cosmological implications, not the least of which would be an explanation for
the quantization of charge itself. We also study such a magnetically charged
binary in the force-free regime and find it much more radiative, reducing even
further the requirements to produce the counterpart.

star formation, SN feedback and a central massive black hole which is
undergoing gas accretion and is heating the surroundings via thermal AGN
feedback. A large central region in the ErisBH disk becomes bar-unstable after
z~1.4, but a clear bar-like structure starts to grow significantly only after
z~0.4, possibly triggered by the interaction with a massive satellite. At z~0.1
the bar reaches its maximum radial extent of l~2.2 kpc. As the bar grows, it
becomes prone to buckling instability, which we quantify based on the
anisotropy of the stellar velocity dispersion. The actual buckling event is
observable at z~0.1, resulting in the formation of a boxy-peanut bulge clearly
discernible in the edge-on view of the galaxy at z=0. The bar in ErisBH does
not dissolve during the formation of the bulge but remains strongly
non-axisymmetric down to the resolution limit of ~100 pc at z=0. During its
early growth, the bar exerts a strong torque on the gas within its extent and
drives gas inflows that enhance the nuclear star formation on sub-kpc scales.
Later on the infalling gas is nearly all consumed into stars and, to a lesser
extent, accreted onto the central black hole, leaving behind a gas-depleted
region within the central ~2 kpc. Observations would more likely identify a
prominent, large-scale bar at the stage when the galactic central region has
already been quenched. Bar-driven quenching may play an important role in
disk-dominated galaxies at all redshift. [Abridged]

spectro-photometric data of the Carnegie-Spitzer-IMACS Survey, for 22,494
galaxies at 0.3<z<0.9 with stellar masses of 10^9 Msun to 10^12 Msun. Our study
moves beyond ""average"" SFHs and distribution functions of specific star
formation rates (sSFRs) to individually measured SFHs for tens of thousands of
galaxies. By comparing star formation rates (SFRs) with timescales of 10^10,
10^9, and 10^8 years, we find a wide diversity of SFHs: 'old galaxies' that
formed most or all of their stars early; galaxies that formed stars with
declining or constant SFRs over a Hubble time, and genuinely 'young galaxies'
that formed most of their stars since z=1. This sequence is one of decreasing
stellar mass, but, remarkably, each type is found over a mass range of a factor
of 10. Conversely, galaxies at any given mass follow a wide range of SFHs,
leading us to conclude that: (1) halo mass does not uniquely determine SFHs;
(2) there is no 'typical' evolutionary track; and (3) ""abundance matching"" has
limitations as a tool for inferring physics. Our observations imply that SFHs
are set at an early epoch, and that--for most galaxies--the decline and
cessation of star formation occurs over a Hubble-time, without distinct
""quenching"" events. SFH diversity is inconsistent with models where galaxy
mass, at any given epoch, grows simply along relations between SFR and stellar
mass, but is consistent with a 2-parameter lognormal form, lending credence to
this model from a new and independent perspective.

to reach global alignment of the black hole spin and its accretion disc with
the binary plane. In low-mass X-ray binaries (LMXBs) there is only a modest
tendency to reach such global alignment, and it is difficult to achieve fully:
except for special initial conditions we expect misalignment of the spin and
orbital planes by ~1 radian for most of the LMXB lifetime. The same is expected
in high-mass X-ray binaries (HMXBs). A fairly close approach to global
alignment is likely in most stellar-mass ultraluminous X-ray binary systems
(ULXs) where the companion star fills its Roche lobe and transfers on a thermal
timescale to a black hole of lower mass. These systems are unlikely to show
orbital eclipses, as their emission cones are close to the hole's spin axis.
This offers a potential observational test, as models for ULXs invoking
intermediate-mass black holes do predict eclipses for ensembles of > ~10
systems. Recent observational work shows that eclipses are either absent or
extremely rare in ULXs, supporting the picture that most ULXs are stellar-mass
binaries with companion stars more massive than the accretor.

galaxy, is actually a giant low surface brightness (GLSB) galaxy which rivals
the archetypical GLSB Malin 1 in size. Like other GLSB galaxies, it has two
components: a high surface brightness disk galaxy surrounded by an extended low
surface brightness (LSB) disk. For UGC1382, the central component is a
lenticular system with an effective radius of 6 kpc. Beyond this, the LSB disk
has an effective radius of ~38 kpc and an extrapolated central surface
brightness of ~26 mag/arcsec^2. Both components have a combined stellar mass of
~8x10^10 M_sun, and are embedded in a massive (10^10 M_sun) low-density (<3
M_sun/pc^2) HI disk with a radius of 110 kpc, making this one of the largest
isolated disk galaxies known. The system resides in a massive dark matter halo
of at least 2x10^12 M_sun. Although possibly part of a small group, its low
density environment likely plays a role in the formation and retention of the
giant LSB and HI disks. We model the spectral energy distributions and find
that the LSB disk is likely older than the lenticular component. UGC1382 has
UV-optical colors typical of galaxies transitioning through the green valley.
Within the LSB disk are spiral arms forming stars at extremely low
efficiencies. The gas depletion time scale of ~10^11 yr suggests that UGC1382
may be a very long term resident of the green valley. We find that the
formation and evolution of the LSB disk is best explained by the accretion of
gas-rich LSB dwarf galaxies.

nucleosynthesis. The amount of heavy r-process material is consistent with the
mass ejection and rates of mergers, and abundances of relic radioactive
materials suggest that heavy r-process material is produced in rare events.
Observations of possible macronovae provide further support for this model.
Still, some concerns remain. One is the observation of heavy r-process elements
in Ultra Faint Dwarf (UFD) galaxies. The escape velocities from UFDs are so
small that the natal kicks, taking place at neutron stars birth, might eject
such binaries from UFDs. Furthermore the old stellar populations of UFDs
requires that r-process nucleosynthesis must have taken place very early on,
while it may take several Gyr for compact binaries to merge. This last problem
arises also within the Milky Way where heavy r-process materials has been
observed in some low metallicity stars. We show here that since a significant
fraction of neutron star binaries form with a very small proper motion those
won't be ejected even from a UFD. Furthermore, a significant fraction of these
binaries merge within a few hundred Myr and in some cases the merger time is
even shorter than a hundred Myr. This population of ""rapid mergers"" explains
the appearance of heavy r-process material in both UFDs and in the Milky Way.

the combined CMB + foreground emission to precision 0.1% or better. The
Rayleigh-Jeans approximation to the dust spectrum biases the fitted dust
spectral index by Delta beta_d = 0.2 and the inflationary B-mode amplitude by
Delta r = 0.03. Fitting the dust to a modified blackbody at a single
temperature biases the best-fit CMB by Delta r > 0.003 if the true dust
spectrum contains multiple temperature components. A 13-parameter model fitting
two temperature components reduces this bias by an order of magnitude if the
true dust spectrum is in fact a simple superposition of emission at different
temperatures, but fails at the level Delta r = 0.006 for dust whose spectral
index varies with frequency. Restricting the observing frequencies to a narrow

experiments can probe the presence of sterile neutrinos in a way that is
different from, and complementary to, the probes of short-baseline experiments.
We explore the question of how large sterile-active mixing angles need to be

procedure builds on the work of G\'acs [Gacs 1986] and Harrington [Harrington
2004] and operates as a local cellular automaton. In contrast to previously
studied schemes, our scheme is valid for both abelian and non-abelian anyons
and accounts for measurement errors. We analytically prove the existence of a
fault-tolerant threshold for a certain class of non-Abelian anyon models, and
numerically simulate the procedure for the specific example of Ising anyons.
The result of our simulations are consistent with a threshold between $10^{-4}$
and $10^{-3}$.

equilibrium associated to nonthermal fixed points with a wide range of topical
applications from early-universe inflaton dynamics and heavy-ion collisions to
strong quenches in ultracold quantum gases. So far, most studies have relied on
a mapping of the quantum dynamics onto a classical-statistical theory that can
be simulated on a computer. However, the mapping is based on a weak-coupling
limit, while phenomenological applications often require moderate interaction
strengths. We report on the observation of nonthermal fixed points directly in
quantum field theory beyond the weak-coupling limit. For the example of a
relativistic scalar O(N)-symmetric quantum field theory, we numerically solve
the nonequilibrium dynamics employing a 1/N expansion to next-to-leading order,
which does not rely on a small coupling parameter. Starting from two different
sets of overoccupied and of strong-field initial conditions, we find that
nonthermal fixed points are not restricted to parameter ranges suitable for
classical-statistical simulations, but extend also to couplings of order one.
While the infrared behavior is found to be insensitive to the differences in
the initial conditions, we demonstrate that transport phenomena to higher
momenta depend on the presence or absence of a symmetry-breaking field
expectation value.

ion species present within it, as well as fast rotation with its dipole axis
titled from its rotational axis. To date global models of Jovian have neglected
the presence of the different ion species as well as the tilted nature of the
dipole axis. This paper reports the results of the first multi-fluid global
modeling of these effects in a single self-consistent study for processes
occurring in the outer magnetosphere. In the inner magnetosphere the model
densities are shown to be comparable to observed densities with much of the
density variables due to the wobble. The wobble enables plasma to be
transported to higher latitudes and then centrifugal acceleration leads to
radial transport of the plasma. At the interface between the middle and outer
magnetosphere, the wobble produces a sinusoidal modulation of the plasma
properties, which yields at a fixed observing point two density peaks, each
with the planetary period. However, because of solar wind forcing and the fast
rotation of Jupiter, torques are exerted on the outer magnetospheric plasma
such that the azimuthal speed between the southern and northern hemispheres are
unequal. This leads to the asymmetric square wave modulation of the plasma
properties in the outer magnetosphere such that only one density peak is seen
each planetary period in the outer magnetosphere. This differential speed leads
to reconnection in the tail at the planetary period and enhanced ejection of
plasma down the tail at the planetary period. These processes could explain the
periodicity seen in the New Horizons' data without the need for invoking
arbitrary solar wind conditions. The energetic particles generated by these
processes are shown to map to the arc-like structures seen in the dusk side
auroral features.

improve upon the baseline system performance by incorporating better

in an overall improvement in signal to distortion ratio (SDR) of 10.3 dB

tedious, expensive, and time-consuming task. One of the main challenges in the
crowd-labeling task is to control for or determine in advance the proportion of
low-quality/malicious labelers. If that proportion grows too high, there is
often a phase transition leading to a steep, non-linear drop in labeling
accuracy as noted by Karger et al. [2014]. To address these challenges, we
propose a new framework called Expert Label Injected Crowd Estimation (ELICE)
and extend it to different versions and variants that delay phase transition
leading to a better labeling accuracy. ELICE automatically combines and boosts
bulk crowd labels supported by labels from experts for limited number of
instances from the dataset. The expert-labels help to estimate the individual
ability of crowd labelers and difficulty of each instance, both of which are
used to aggregate the labels. Empirical evaluation shows the superiority of
ELICE as compared to other state-of-the-art methods. We also derive a lower
bound on the number of expert-labeled instances needed to estimate the crowd
ability and dataset difficulty as well as to get better quality labels.

$O(1)$, should at criticality be polynomial in $n$ for $1< q \leq 4$, and
exponential in $n$ for $q>4$ in accordance with the predicted discontinuous
phase transition. This was confirmed for $q=2$ (the Ising model) by the second

  Here we show that the following holds for the critical Potts model on the
torus: for $q=3$, the inverse gap of Glauber dynamics is $n^{O(1)}$; for $q=4$,
it is at most $n^{O(\log n)}$; and for every $q>4$ in the phase-coexistence

are exponential in $n$.
  For free or monochromatic boundary conditions and large $q$, we show that the
dynamics at criticality is faster than on the torus (unlike the Ising model
where free/periodic boundary conditions induce similar dynamical behavior at
all temperatures): the inverse gap of Swendsen--Wang dynamics is
$\exp(n^{o(1)})$.

Its dual linear program expresses the problem of finding a minimum-weight set

flexible class of mixture models for s-CT generation, that incorporates spatial

of class memberships associated with a mixture model. Furthermore, the mixture
distributions are extended from Gaussian to normal inverse Gaussian (NIG),
allowing heavier tails and skewness. The amount of data needed to train a model

efficiency of the parameter estimation and prediction methods are hence
paramount, especially when spatial dependency is included in the models. A
stochastic Expectation Maximization (EM) gradient algorithm is proposed in
order to tackle this challenge. The advantages of the spatial model and NIG

patients. The study show that the proposed model enhances the predictive
quality of the s-CT images by reducing the mean absolute error with 17.9%.
Also, the distribution of CT values conditioned on the MR images are better
explained by the proposed model as evaluated using continuous ranked
probability scores.

sources and sinks is critical to define baselines, and assess the effectiveness
of climate governance over time. Such information and the means to
independently verify its credibility continue to remain out of reach including
in the recent Paris agreement. This essay argues that to make real progress in
mitigating future climate change, this status quo must be challenged both
intellectually and practically. First, it proposes to acknowledge and address
the inconsistency between the objectives of a climate regime and the role of
transparency as a mean to achieve these objectives. It does so by redefining
transparency as the addition of publicity and measurability, which turns it
into a credible information generating mechanism for governance. Second, it
shows how in practice, a global monitoring system of greenhouse gas net
emissions, based on this new definition of transparency and designed as a
global public good, could provide the necessary knowledge to help frame
governance solutions by providing both credibility and completeness in
understanding the scope of the problem to solve.

constant, uniform (dynamic) viscosity and thermal conductivity in a uniform
gravity field. Top and bottom boundaries are maintained at different constant
temperatures and we consider here boundary conditions of zero tangential stress
and impermeable walls. Under these conditions, and with the Boussinesq
approximation, Rayleigh (1916) first obtained analytically the critical value
27pi^4/4 for a dimensionless parameter, now known as the Rayleigh number, at
the onset of convection. This manuscript describes the changes of the critical
Rayleigh number due to the compressibility of the fluid, measured by the
dimensionless dissipation parameter D and due to a finite temperature
difference between the hot and cold boundaries, measured by a dimensionless
temperature gradient a. Different equations of state are examined: ideal gas
equation, Murnaghan's model and a generic equation of state, which can
represent any possible equation of state. We also consider two variations of
this stability analysis. In a so-called quasi-Boussinesq model, we consider
that density perturbations are solely due to temperature perturbations. In a
so-called quasi-anelastic liquid approximation, we consider that entropy
perturbations are solely due to temperature perturbations. In addition to the
numerical Chebyshev-based stability analysis, an analytical approximation is
obtained when temperature fluctuations are written as a combination of only two
modes. This analytical expression allows us to show that the superadiabatic
critical Rayleigh number quadratic departure in a and D from 27pi^4/4 involves
the expansion of density up to the degree three in terms of pressure and

In this paper we apply persistent homology to the characterization of gas
plumes in time dependent sequences of hyperspectral cubes, i.e. the analysis of
4-way arrays. We investigate hyperspectral movies of Long-Wavelength Infrared
data monitoring an experimental release of chemical simulant into the air. Our
approach models regions of interest within the hyperspectral data cubes as
points on the real Grassmann manifold $G(k, n)$ (whose points parameterize the
$k$-dimensional subspaces of $\mathbb{R}^n$), contrasting our approach with the
more standard framework in Euclidean space. An advantage of this approach is
that it allows a sequence of time slices in a hyperspectral movie to be
collapsed to a sequence of points in such a way that some of the key structure
within and between the slices is encoded by the points on the Grassmann
manifold. This motivates the search for topological features, associated with
the evolution of the frames of a hyperspectral movie, within the corresponding
points on the Grassmann manifold. The proposed mathematical model affords the
processing of large data sets while retaining valuable discriminatory

However, the interpretation of experimental results in the search of new
nanoparticles poses several challenges. This is due to the characteristics of
nanoparticles images and due to their multiple intricate properties; one
property of recurrent interest is the agglomeration of particles. Addressing
this issue, this paper introduces an approach that uses complex networks to
detect and describe nanoparticle agglomerates so to foster easier and more
insightful analyses. In this approach, each detected particle in an image
corresponds to a vertice and the distances between the particles define a
criterion for creating edges. Edges are created if the distance is smaller than
a radius of interest. Once this network is set, we calculate several discrete
measures able to reveal the most outstanding agglomerates in a nanoparticle
image. Experimental results using images of Scanning Tunneling Microscopy (STM)
of gold nanoparticles demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed approach
over several samples, as reflected by the separability between particles in
three usual settings. The results also demonstrated efficacy for both convex

occurs at the outer region of the pulsar magnetosphere. The magnetic field
lines in the outer acceleration region (OAR) are connected to the neutron star
surface (NSS). If copious electron--positron pairs are produced near the NSS,
such pairs flow into the OAR and screen the electric field there. To activate
the OAR, the electromagnetic cascade due to the electric field near the NSS
should be suppressed. However, since a return current is expected along the
field lines through the OAR, the outflow extracted from the NSS alone cannot
screen the electric field just above the NSS. In this paper, we analytically
and numerically study the electric-field screening at the NSS taking into
account the effects of the back-flowing particles from the OAR. In certain
limited cases, the electric field is screened without significant pair cascade
if only ultrarelativistic particles ($\gamma\gg1$) flow back to the NSS. On the
other hand, if electron--positron pairs with a significant number density and
mildly relativistic temperature, expected to distribute in a wide region of the
magnetosphere, flow back to the NSS, these particles adjust the current and
charge densities, so that the electric field can be screened without pair
cascade. We obtain the condition for the number density of particles to screen
the electric field at the NSS. We also find that in ion-extracted case from the
NSS, bunches of particles are ejected to the outer region quasi-periodically,
which is a possible mechanism of observed radio emission.

considering the local conditions required for the formation of multiphase gas
via two different modes: (1) uplift of ambient gas by galactic outflows, and
(2) condensation in a stratified stationary medium in which thermal balance is
explicitly maintained. Analytic exploration of these two modes provides
insights into the relationships between the local ratio of the cooling and
freefall time scales (i.e., t_cool / t_ff), the large-scale gradient of
specific entropy, and development of precipitation and multiphase media in
circumgalactic gas. We then use these analytic findings to interpret recent
simulations of circumgalactic gas in which global thermal balance is
maintained. We show that long-lasting configurations of gas with 5 < t_cool /
t_ff < 20 and radial entropy profiles similar to observations of local
cool-core galaxy cluster cores are a natural outcome of precipitation-regulated
feedback. We conclude with some observational predictions that follow from
these models. This work focuses primarily on precipitation and AGN feedback in
galaxy cluster cores, because that is where the observations of multiphase gas
around galaxies are most complete. However, many of the physical principles
that govern condensation in those environments apply to circumgalactic gas
around galaxies of all masses.

coordinates were used in previous studies to seek MHD equilibria involving a
magnetic flux rope embedded in a bipolar, partially open background field. As
demonstrated by these studies, the equilibrium solutions of the system are
separated into two branches: the flux rope sticks to the photosphere for
solutions at the lower branch but is suspended in the corona for those at the
upper branch. Moreover, a solution originally at the lower branch jumps to the
upper, as the related control parameter increases and reaches a critical value,
and the associated jump is here referred to as upward catastrophe. The present
paper advances these studies in three aspects. First, the magnetic field is
changed to be force-free. The system still experiences an upward catastrophe
with an increase in each control parameter. Secondly, under the force-free
approximation, there also exists a downward catastrophe, characterized by a
jump of a solution from the upper branch to the lower. Both catastrophes are
irreversible processes connecting the two branches of equilibrium solutions so
as to form a cycle. Finally, the magnetic energy in the numerical domain is
calculated. It is found that there exists a magnetic energy release for both
catastrophes. The Amp\`{e}re's force, which vanishes everywhere for force-free
fields, appears only during the catastrophes and does a positive work, which
serves as a major mechanism for the energy release. The implications of the
downward catastrophe and its relevance to solar activities are briefly
discussed.

the sixth LIGO science run. The target was the nearby globular cluster NGC 6544
at a distance of 2.7 kpc. The search covered a broad band of frequencies along
with first and second frequency derivatives for a fixed sky position. The
search coherently integrated data from the two LIGO interferometers over a time
span of 9.2 days using the matched-filtering F-statistic. We found no
gravitational-wave signals and set 95% confidence upper limits as stringent as
6.0 X 10^{-25} on intrinsic strain and 8.5 X 10^{-6} on fiducial ellipticity.
These values beat the indirect limits from energy conservation for stars with
characteristic spindown ages older than 300 years and are within the range of
theoretical predictions for possible neutron-star ellipticities. An important
feature of this search was use of a barycentric resampling algorithm which
substantially reduced computational cost; this method will be used extensively
in searches of Advanced LIGO and Virgo detector data.

  Stochastic Time-Delay Systems",,,,,"math.DS","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The problem of p-th moment stability for time-varying stochastic time-delay
systems with Markovian switching is investigated in this paper. Some novel
stability criteria are obtained by applying the generalized Razumikhin and
Krasovskii stability theorems. Both p-th moment asymptotic stability and
(integral) input-to-state stability are considered based on the notion and
properties of uniformly stable functions and the improved comparison
principles. The established results show that time-derivatives of the
constructed Razumikhin functions and Krasovskii functionals are allowed to be
indefinite, which improve the existing results on this topic. By applying the
obtained results for stochastic systems, we also analyze briefly the stability
of time-varying deterministic time-delay systems. Finally, examples are
provided to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed results.

computing the Turaev-Viro invariants TV(4,q), using the dimension of the first

  This is, to our knowledge, the first parameterised algorithm in computational
3-manifold topology using a topological parameter. The computation of TV(4,q)
is known to be #P-hard in general; using a topological parameter provides an
algorithm polynomial in the size of the input triangulation for the extremely
large family of 3-manifolds with first homology group of bounded rank.
  Our algorithm is easy to implement and running times are comparable with
running times to compute integral homology groups for standard libraries of
triangulated 3-manifolds. The invariants we can compute this way are powerful:
in combination with integral homology and using standard data sets we are able
to roughly double the pairs of 3-manifolds we can distinguish.
  We hope this qualifies TV(4,q) to be added to the short list of standard
properties (such as orientability, connectedness, Betti numbers, etc.) that can
be computed ad-hoc when first investigating an unknown triangulation.

in molten carbonates provides a low cost route to extract and store this
greenhouse gas. CNTs are more stable, compact and valuable than fuels or other
CO2 conversion products, providing an incentive to remove CO2 for climate
mitigation. Previously, solid core carbon nanofibers, CNFs were formed with
C-13 isotope CO2, whereas hollow core fibers - carbon nanotubes, CNTs, were
formed with natural isotope CO2 splitting in molten lithium carbonate. Here we
demonstrate the extraordinary range of specific morphologies and conductivities
of CNTs that can be achieved through control of the electrolysis conditions in
a one pot-synthesis, and scale-up of this process by which the greenhouse gas
CO2 is transformed into carbon nanotubes by molten carbonate electrolysis.
Addition of Li2BO3, boron dopes and greatly enhances CNT conductivity formed at
the galvanized steel cathode. Addition of CaCO3 to the Li2CO3 electrolyte,
decreases oxide solubility in the region of CNT growth, producing straight

location in our uni- verse. This assumption has not been observationally
confirmed yet in sufficient accuracy, and we need to consider the possibility
that there are non-negligible large-scale isotropic inhomogeneities in our
universe. The existence of large-scale isotropic inhomogeneities affects the
determination of the cosmological parameters. In particular, from only the
distance-redshift relation, we can not dis- tinguish the inhomogeneous
isotropic universe model from the homogeneous isotropic one, because of the
ambiguity in the cosmological parameters. In this paper, in order to avoid such
ambiguity, we consider three observables, the distance-redshift relation, the
fluctuation spectrum of the cosmic microwave background radiation(CMBR) and the
scale of the baryon acoustic oscillation(BAO), and compare these observables in
two universe models; One is the inhomogeneous isotropic uni- verse model with
the cosmological constant and the other is the homogeneous isotropic universe
model with the dark energy other than the cosmological constant. We show that
these two universe models can not predict the same observational data of all
three observables but the same ones of only two of three, as long as the
perturbations are adiabatic. In principle, we can distinguish the inhomogeneous
isotropic universe from the homogeneous isotropic one through appropriate three
observables, if the perturbations are adiabatic.

with finite Rokhlin dimension, and that these crossed products are stable.
Furthermore, we show that a flow on a commutative C*-algebra arising from a
free topological flow has finite Rokhlin dimension, whenever the spectrum is a
locally compact metrizable space with finite covering dimension. For flows that
are both free and minimal, this has strong consequences for the associated
crossed product C*-algebras: Those containing a non-zero projection are
classified by the Elliott invariant (for compact manifolds this consists of
topological K-theory together with the space of invariant probability measures
and a natural pairing given by the Ruelle-Sullivan map).

data may affect the results of computations in unwanted ways and thus leak
information. Dynamic information flow analysis adds instrumentation code to the
target software to track flows at run time and raise alarms if a flow policy is
violated; hybrid analyses combine this with preliminary static analysis.
  Using a subset of C as the target language, we extend previous work on hybrid
information flow analysis that handled pointers to scalars. Our extended
formulation handles arrays, pointers to array elements, and pointer arithmetic.
Information flow through arrays of pointers is tracked precisely while arrays
of non-pointer types are summarized efficiently.
  A prototype of our approach is implemented using the Frama-C program analysis
and transformation framework. Work on a full machine-checked proof of the
correctness of our approach using Isabelle/HOL is well underway; we present the

The generation of counterexamples is considered to be one of the primary

model checking does succeed in verifying a property, there is typically no
independently checkable witness that can be used as evidence for the verified
property. Previously, we have shown how program transformation techniques can
be used for the verification of both safety and liveness properties of reactive
systems. However, no counterexamples or witnesses were generated using the
described techniques. In this paper, we address this issue. In particular, we
show how the program transformation technique distillation can be used to
facilitate the construction of counterexamples and witnesses for temporal
properties of reactive systems. Example systems which are intended to model
mutual exclusion are analysed using these techniques with respect to both
safety (mutual exclusion) and liveness (non-starvation), with counterexamples
being generated for those properties which do not hold.

represent a quality measure. Such analyses cover important applications, e.g.
resource usage. Examining all traces is well known to be intractable and
therefore traditional algorithms reason over an over-approximated set.
Typically, inaccuracy arises due to inclusion of infeasible paths in this set.
Thus path-sensitivity is one cure. However, there is another reason for the
inaccuracy: that the cost model, i.e., the way in which the analysis of each
trace is quantified, is dynamic. That is, the cost of a trace is dependent on
the context in which the trace is executed. Thus the goal of accurate analysis,
already challenged by path-sensitivity, is now further challenged by
context-sensitivity.
  In this paper, we address the problem of quantitative analysis defined over a
dynamic cost model. Our algorithm is an ""anytime"" algorithm: it generates an
answer quickly, but if the analysis resource budget allows, it progressively
produces better solutions via refinement iterations. The result of each
iteration remains sound, but importantly, must converge to an exact analysis
when given an unlimited resource budget. In order to be scalable, our algorithm
is designed to be incremental. We finally give evidence that a new level of
practicality is achieved by an evaluation on a realistic collection of
benchmarks.

first example of such a group was given by Miller in 1913. Many other examples
of Miller $p$-groups have been constructed by several authors. Recently, A.
Caranti [{\it Israel J. Mathematics {\bf 205} (2015), 235-246}] provided module
theoretic methods for constructing non-special Miller $p$-groups from special
Miller $p$-groups. By constructing examples, we show that these methods do not
always work. We also provide a sufficient condition on special Miller $p$-group
for which the methods of Caranti work.

  MMSE Data Estimators",,,,,"math.ST stat.AP stat.TH","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In soft decoding of data bits, the log-likelihood ratios are evaluated from
the estimated data symbols. For proper constellation diagrams such as QPSK or
16-QAM, these data symbols are often estimated using the linear minimum mean
square error (LMMSE) estimator. The LMMSE estimator only fulfills the weak
Bayesian unbiasedness constraint. Recently, estimators fulfilling the more
stringent component-wise conditionally unbiased (CWCU) constraints have been
investigated, such as the CWCU LMMSE estimator. In this paper, we prove that
the CWCU LMMSE estimates result in the very same log-likelihood ratios as the
LMMSE estimates. For improper constellation diagrams such as 8-QAM, widely
linear estimators are used. For this case, we show that the widely linear
versions of the LMMSE estimator and the CWCU LMMSE estimator also yield
identical log-likelihood ratios. Finally, we give a simulation example which
illustrates a number of interesting properties of the discussed widely linear
estimators.

requirements pose big challenges for radio transmitter and power amplifier (PA)
design and implementation. Due to the nonlinear nature of the PA, severe
unwanted emissions can occur, which can potentially interfere with neighboring
channel signals or even desensitize the own receiver in frequency division
duplexing (FDD) transceivers. In this article, to suppress such unwanted
emissions, a low-complexity sub-band DPD solution, specifically tailored for
spectrally noncontiguous transmission schemes in low-cost devices, is proposed.
The proposed technique aims at mitigating only the selected spurious
intermodulation distortion components at the PA output, hence allowing for
substantially reduced processing complexity compared to classical linearization
solutions. Furthermore, novel decorrelation based parameter learning solutions
are also proposed and formulated, which offer reduced computing complexity in
parameter estimation as well as the ability to track time-varying features
adaptively. Comprehensive simulation and RF measurement results are provided,
using a commercial LTE-Advanced mobile PA, to evaluate and validate the
effectiveness of the proposed solution in real world scenarios. The obtained
results demonstrate that highly efficient spurious component suppression can be
obtained using the proposed solutions.

solutions to the Einstein's equations obtained by the Hamiltonian reduction.
The key element to the successful Hamiltonian reduction is finding the
privileged spacetime coordinates in which physical degrees of freedom
manifestly reside in the conformal two-metric, and all the other metric
components are determined by the conformal two-metric. In the privileged
coordinates the Einstein's constraint equations become trivial; the Hamiltonian
and momentum constraints are simply the defining equations of a non-vanishing
gravitational Hamiltonian and momentum densities in terms of conformal
two-metric and its conjugate momentum, respectively. Thus, given any conformal
two-metric, which is a constraint-free data, one can construct the whole
4-dimensional spacetime by integrating the first-order superpotential
equations. As the first examples of using Hamiltonian reduction in solving the
Einstein's equations, we found two exact solutions to the Einstein's equations
in the privileged coordinates. Suitable coordinate transformations from the
privileged to the standard coordinates show that they are just the
Einstein-Rosen wave and the Schwarzschild solution. The local gravitational
Hamiltonian and momentum densities of these spacetimes are also presented in
the privileged coordinates.

characterized by a clear connection between the inflow onto the black hole and

Cyg apparently does not fit in this picture. Its outbursts are characterized by
intense flares and intermittent low-flux states, with a dynamical range of
several orders of magnitude on timescales of hours. During the 2015 June-July
X-ray outburst a joint Swift and INTEGRAL observing campaign captured V404 Cyg
in one of these low-flux states. The simultaneous Swift/XRT and
INTEGRAL/JEM-X/ISGRI spectrum is reminiscent of that of obscured/absorbed AGN.
It can be modeled as a Comptonization spectrum, heavily absorbed by a partial
covering, high-column density material ($N_\textrm{H} \approx
1.4\times10^{24}\,\textrm{cm}^{-2}$), and a dominant reflection component,
including a narrow Iron-K$\alpha$ line. Such spectral distribution can be
produced by a geometrically thick accretion flow able to launch a clumpy mass
outflow, likely responsible for both the high intrinsic absorption and the
intense reflection emission observed. Similarly to what happens in certain
obscured AGN, the low-flux states might not be solely related to a decrease in
the intrinsic luminosity, but could instead be caused by an almost complete
obscuration of the inner accretion flow.

games, with no chance moves, played on a finite set (board) with special
subsets known as the winning sets. Each round of the biased $(1:q)$ game begins
with Waiter offering $q+1$ previously unclaimed elements of the board to
Client, who claims one. The $q$ elements remaining are then claimed by Waiter.
If Client fully claims a winning set by the time all board elements have been
offered, he wins in the Client-Waiter game and loses in the Waiter-Client game.
We give an estimate for the threshold bias of the $(1:q)$ Waiter-Client and
Client-Waiter versions of two different games: the non-2-colourability game,
played on the complete $k$-uniform hypergraph, and the $k$-SAT game. In
particular, we show that the unique value of $q$ at which the winner of the
Client-Waiter version of the non-2-colourability game changes is
$\frac{1}{n}\binom{n}{k}2^{-k(1+o_k(1))}$ and, for the Waiter-Client version,
the corresponding value of $q$ is $\frac{1}{n}\binom{n}{k}2^{\Theta_k(k)}$.
Additionally, we show that the threshold bias for the Waiter-Client and
Client-Waiter versions of the $k$-SAT game is $\frac{1}{n}\binom{n}{k}$ up to a
factor that is exponential and polynomial in $k$ respectively. This shows that
these games exhibit the ""probabilistic intuition"".

the decay products of new states are soft and immersed in a large standard

two universal extra dimensions. We obtain the current bound by using the
production of second level excitations of electroweak gauge bosons decaying to
a pair of leptons and study the reach of the LHC Run~II in this channel. We
also introduce a new channel originating in higher dimensional operators and
resulting in the single production of a second level quark excitation. Its
subsequent decay into a hard jet and lepton pair resonance would allow the
identification of a more model-specific process, unlike the more generic vector
resonance signal. We show that the sensitivity of this channel to the
compactification scale is very similar to the one obtained using the vector
resonance.

outflows detected in the region. The most evolved objects are located at the
southeastern edge of the dust filamentary structure and the youngest ones at

1 have radii between $\sim$200 and $\sim$375 au and masses in the

velocity ($\sim$7 km s$^{-1}$) SiO bipolar outflow, close to the plane of the

short-lived, episodic, bipolar outflow observed through H$_2$O masers at much
smaller scales ($\sim $180 au), and that has been created by the accumulation
of the ejection of several episodic collimated events of material. The
circumstellar gas around VLA 2 and VLA 3 is hot ($\sim$130 K) and exhibits
velocity gradients that could trace rotation. There is a bridge of warm and

was developed in a series of our papers. The theory leverages symmetry of
isotropic statistics such as Minkowski functionals and extrema counts to
develop post- Gaussian expansion of the statistics in orthogonal polynomials of
invariant descriptors of the field, its first and second derivatives. The
application of the approach to 2D fields defined on a spherical sky was
suggested, but never rigorously developed. In this paper we present such
development treating effects of the curvature and finiteness of the spherical
space $S_2$ exactly, without relying on the flat-sky approximation. We present
Minkowski functionals, including Euler characteristic and extrema counts to the
first non-Gaussian correction, suitable for weakly non-Gaussian fields on a

  revised section on Cauchy sequences in a partial metric space",,,,"math.CT math.GN","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  For any small quantaloid $\Q$, there is a new quantaloid $\D(\Q)$ of
diagonals in $\Q$. If $\Q$ is divisible then so is $\D(\Q)$ (and vice versa),
and then it is particularly interesting to compare categories enriched in $\Q$
with categories enriched in $\D(\Q)$. Taking Lawvere's quantale of extended
positive real numbers as base quantale, $\Q$-categories are generalised metric
spaces, and $\D(\Q)$-categories are generalised partial metric spaces, i.e.\
metric spaces in which self-distance need not be zero and with a suitably
modified triangular inequality. We show how every small quantaloid-enriched
category has a canonical closure operator on its set of objects: this makes for
a functor from quantaloid-enriched categories to closure spaces. Under mild
necessary-and-sufficient conditions on the base quantaloid, this functor lands
in the category of topological spaces; and an involutive quantaloid is
Cauchy-bilateral (a property discovered earlier in the context of distributive
laws) if and only if the closure on any enriched category is identical to the
closure on its symmetrisation. As this now applies to metric spaces and partial
metric spaces alike, we demonstrate how these general categorical constructions
produce the ""correct"" definitions of convergence and Cauchyness of sequences in
generalised partial metric spaces. Finally we describe the Cauchy-completion,
the Hausdorff contruction and exponentiability of a partial metric space, again
by application of general quantaloid-enriched category theory.

Pharmacodynamics (PD) may be used in evaluating efficacy if there are relevant

equivalence, incorporating the new PK trial for PK equivalence within the PK

the symmetry properties of the dipole-octupole doublets, we predict the
peculiar physical properties of the octupolar U(1) QSL, elucidating the unique
spectroscopic properties in the externalmagnetic fields. We further predict the
Anderson-Higgs transition from the octupolar U(1) QSL driven by the external
magnetic fields. We identify the experimental relevance with the candidate

how cooperation emerge in multiplex complex topologies by analyzing a

game in a network, and a threshold cascade model in the other. The threshold
model is intended to abstract the behavior of a network of vigilant nodes, that
impose pressure of being observed altering hence the temptation to defect of
the dilemma. Cooperation or defection in the game also affects the state of a

structures and assess the influence of the topology, average degree and
correlated multiplexity, on the outcome of cooperation. Interestingly, we find
that the social pressure of vigilance may impact cooperation positively or
negatively, depending on the duplex structure, specifically the degree
correlations between layers is determinant. Our results give further
quantitative insights in the promotion of cooperation under social pressure.

sites. Our fundamental finding completes, for this general class of systems,
the one-to-one correspondence between ground states, their densities, and the
external potential at the base of the Hohenberg-Kohn theorem. Moreover we
demonstrate that the mapping from wave function to potential is unique not just
for the ground state, but also for excited states. To illustrate our findings,
we develop a practical inversion scheme to determine the external potential
from a given density. Our results hold for a general class of lattice models,
which includes the Hubbard model.

  Bloat with Macro-Op Fusion for RISC-V",,,,"UCB/EECS-2016-130","cs.AR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  This report makes the case that a well-designed Reduced Instruction Set
Computer (RISC) can match, and even exceed, the performance and code density of
existing commercial Complex Instruction Set Computers (CISC) while maintaining
the simplicity and cost-effectiveness that underpins the original RISC goals.
  We begin by comparing the dynamic instruction counts and dynamic instruction
bytes fetched for the popular proprietary ARMv7, ARMv8, IA-32, and x86-64
Instruction Set Architectures (ISAs) against the free and open RISC-V RV64G and
RV64GC ISAs when running the SPEC CINT2006 benchmark suite. RISC-V was designed
as a very small ISA to support a wide range of implementations, and has a less
mature compiler toolchain. However, we observe that on SPEC CINT2006 RV64G
executes on average 16% more instructions than x86-64, 3% more instructions
than IA-32, 9% more instructions than ARMv8, but 4% fewer instructions than
ARMv7.
  CISC x86 implementations break up complex instructions into smaller internal
RISC-like micro-ops, and the RV64G instruction count is within 2% of the x86-64
retired micro-op count. RV64GC, the compressed variant of RV64G, is the densest
ISA studied, fetching 8% fewer dynamic instruction bytes than x86-64. We
observed that much of the increased RISC-V instruction count is due to a small
set of common multi-instruction idioms.
  Exploiting this fact, the RV64G and RV64GC effective instruction count can be
reduced by 5.4% on average by leveraging macro-op fusion. Combining the
compressed RISC-V ISA extension with macro-op fusion provides both the densest
ISA and the fewest dynamic operations retired per program, reducing the
motivation to add more instructions to the ISA. This approach retains a single
simple ISA suitable for both low-end and high-end implementations, where
high-end implementations can boost performance through microarchitectural
techniques.

few times $10^{-4}$ can be generated. The particle growth in the early planet
formation phase is determined by the dynamics of dust particles. Here, we
address in particular the efficiency of VSI-turbulence in concentrating
particles in order to generate overdensities and low collision velocities. We
perform 3D numerical hydrodynamical simulations of accretion discs around young
stars that include radiative transport and irradiation from the central star.
The motion of particles within a size range of a fraction of mm up to several m
is followed using standard drag formula. We confirm that under realistic
conditions the VSI is able to generate turbulence in full 3D protoplanetary
discs. The irradiated disc shows turbulence within 10 to 60au. The mean radial
motion of the gas is such that it is directed inward near the midplane and
outward in the surface layers. We find that large particles drift inward with
the expected speed, while small particles can experience phases of outward
drift. Additionally, the particles show bunching behaviour with overdensities
reaching 5 times the average value, which is strongest for dimensionless
stopping times around unity. Particles in a VSI-turbulent discs are
concentrated in large scale turbulent eddies and show low relative speeds that
allow for growing collisions. The reached overdensities will also allow for the
onset streaming instabilities further enhancing particle growth. The outward
drift for small particles at higher disk elevations allows for the transport of
processed high temperature material in the Solar System to larger distances.

  International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS 2016)",,,,"cs.RO cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In this work, we present an approach to learn cost maps for driving in
complex urban environments from a very large number of demonstrations of
driving behaviour by human experts. The learned cost maps are constructed
directly from raw sensor measurements, bypassing the effort of manually
designing cost maps as well as features. When deploying the learned cost maps,
the trajectories generated not only replicate human-like driving behaviour but
are also demonstrably robust against systematic errors in putative robot
configuration. To achieve this we deploy a Maximum Entropy based, non-linear
IRL framework which uses Fully Convolutional Neural Networks (FCNs) to
represent the cost model underlying expert driving behaviour. Using a deep,
parametric approach enables us to scale efficiently to large datasets and
complex behaviours by being run-time independent of dataset extent during
deployment. We demonstrate the scalability and the performance of the proposed
approach on an ambitious dataset collected over the course of one year
including more than 25k demonstration trajectories extracted from over 120km of
driving around pedestrianised areas in the city of Milton Keynes, UK. We
evaluate the resulting cost representations by showing the advantages over a
carefully manually designed cost map and, in addition, demonstrate its
robustness to systematic errors by learning precise cost-maps even in the
presence of system calibration perturbations.

Fu-Kane spin pumping model as an example. We show that the Kane-Mele invariant
in this model is Z2 invariant modulo the spectral flow of a single-parameter
family of 1+1-dimensional Dirac operators with a global boundary condition
induced by the Kramers degeneracy of the system. This spectral flow is defined
as an integer which counts the difference between the number of eigenvalues of
the Dirac operator family that flow from negative to non-negative and the
number of eigenvalues that flow from non-negative to negative. Since the bulk
states of the insulator are completely gapped and the ground state is assumed
being no more degenerate except the Kramers, they do not contribute to the
spectral flow and only edge states contribute to. The parity of the number of
the Kramers pairs of gapless edge states is exactly the same as that of the
spectral flow. This reveals the origin of the edge-bulk correspondence, i.e.,
why the edge states can be used to characterize the topological insulators.
Furthermore, the spectral flow is related to the reduced eta-invariant and thus
counts both the discrete ground state degeneracy and the continuous gapless
excitations, which distinguishes the topological insulator from the
conventional band insulator even if the edge states open a gap due to a strong
interaction between edge modes. We emphasize that these results are also valid
even for a weak disordered and/or weak interacting system. The higher spectral
flow to categorize the higher-dimensional topological insulators are expected.

significant polarization at both the observed epochs: one 24 days before

and no physical departure from the main axis at either epoch. The polarization

use a Monte Carlo code to demonstrate that these properties are consistent with
a simple toy model that adopts an axi-symmetric ellipsoidal configuration for

possibly due to a strong wavelength dependence in the line opacity, while the
higher level of polarisation at the second epoch is a consequence of the
increase in the asphericity of the inner layers of the ejecta or the fact that
the photosphere recedes into less spherical layers. The geometry of the

collisions is unstable, if weakly coupled, due to the anisotropy of its
momentum distribution. Chromomagnetic fields are spontaneously generated and
can reach magnitudes much exceeding typical values of the fields in
equilibrated plasma. We consider a high energy test parton traversing an
unstable plasma that is populated with strong fields. We study the momentum
broadening parameter $\hat q$ which determines the radiative energy loss of the
test parton. We develop a formalism which gives $\hat q$ as the solution of an
initial value problem, and we focus on extremely oblate plasmas which are
physically relevant for relativistic heavy ion collisions. The parameter $\hat
q$ is found to be strongly dependent on time. For short times it is of the
order of the equilibrium value, but at later times $\hat q$ grows exponentially
due to the interaction of the test parton with unstable modes and becomes much
bigger than the value in equilibrium. The momentum broadening is also strongly
directionally dependent and is largest when the test parton velocity is
transverse to the beam axis. Consequences of our findings for the phenomenology
of jet quenching in relativistic heavy ion collisions are briefly discussed.

point is investigated for both $\beta=0$ and $\beta \neq 0$ plasmas. Previous
work has shown that the Alfv\'en speed, here $v_A \propto r$, plays a vital
role in such systems and so a natural choice is to switch to polar coordinates.
For the $\beta=0$ plasma, we derive an analytical solution for the behaviour of
the fast magnetoacoustic wave in terms of the Klein-Gordon equation. We also
solve the system with a semi-analytical WKB approximation which shows that the
$\beta=0$ wave focuses on the null and contracts around it but, due to
exponential decay, never reaches the null in a finite time. For the $\beta \neq
0$ plasma, we solve the system numerically and find the behaviour to be similar
to that of the $\beta=0$ system at large radii, but completely different close
to the null. We show that for an initially cylindrically-symmetric fast
magnetoacoustic wave perturbation, there is a decrease in wave speed along the
separatrices and so the perturbation starts to take on a quasi-diamond shape;
with the corners located along the separatrices. This is due to the growth in
pressure gradients that reach a maximum along the separatrices, which in turn
reduces the acceleration of the fast wave along the separatrices leading to a
deformation of the wave morphology.

order to show the impossibility to speak of the way a quantum system behaves
before being detected. In a double-slit experiment, when do photons decide to
travel by one way or by two ways? Delayed choice experiments seem to indicate
that, strangely, it is possible to change the decision of the photons until the
very last moment before they are detected. This led Wheeler to his famous
sentence: No elementary quantum phenomenon is a phenomenon until it is a
registered phenomenon, brought to a close by an irreversible act of
amplification. Nevertheless some authors wrote that backward in time effects
were needed to explain these results. I will show that in delayed choice
experiments involving only one particle, a simple explanation is possible
without invoking any backward in time effect. Delayed choice experiments
involving entangled particles such as the so called quantum eraser can also be
explained without invoking any backward in time effect but I will argue that
these experiments cannot be accounted for so simply because they rise the whole
problem of knowing what a measurement and a collapse are. A previously
presented interpretation, Convivial Solipsism, is a natural framework for
giving a simple explanation of these delayed choice experiments with entangled
particles. In this paper, I show how Convivial Solipsism helps clarifying the
puzzling questions raised by the collapse of the wave function of entangled

Starting from the Liouville equation and utilising Zwanzig's

DDFT equation is obtained. Whilst this equation has some similarities with
DDFTs for spherically-symmetric colloids, it involves a
translational-rotational coupling which affects the diffusivity of the

by a highly intense, sub-cycle THz pulse of duration $\approx$~150~fs is
investigated in the context of force-field molecular dynamics simulations. We
focus our attention on the mechanisms by which rotational and translational
degrees of freedom of the water monomers gain energy from these sub-cycle
pulses with an electric field amplitude of up to about 0.6~V/{\AA}. It has been
recently shown that pulses with these characteristics can be generated in the
laboratory [PRL 112, 213901 (2014)]. Through their permanent dipole moment,
water molecules are acted upon by the electric field and forced off their
preferred hydrogen-bond network conformation. This immediately sets them in
motion with respect to one another as energy quickly transfers to their
relative center of mass displacements. We find that, in the bulk, the operation
of these mechanisms is strongly dependent on the initial temperature and
density of the system. In low density systems, the equilibration between
rotational and translational modes is slow due to the lack of collisions
between monomers. As the initial density of the system approaches 1~g/cm$^3$,
equilibration between rotational and translational modes after the pulse
becomes more efficient. In turn, low temperatures hinder the direct energy
transfer from the pulse to rotational motion owing to the resulting stiffness
of the hydrogen bond network. For small clusters of just a few water molecules
we find that fragmentation due to the interaction with the pulse is faster than
equilibration between rotations and translations, meaning that the latter
remain colder than the former after the pulse.

field created from two magnetic dipoles. The magnetic topology contains an
X-line. We aim to contribute to the overall understanding of MHD wave
propagation within inhomogeneous media, specifically around X-lines. We
investigate the linearised, 3D MHD equations under the assumptions of ideal and
cold plasma. We utilise the WKB approximation and Charpit's method during our
investigation. It is found that the behaviour of the fast magnetoacoustic wave
is entirely dictated by the local, inhomogeneous, equilibrium Alfv\'en speed
profile. All parts of the wave experience refraction during propagation, where
the magnitude of the refraction effect depends on the location of an individual
wave element within the inhomogeneous magnetic field. The X-line, along which
the Alfv\'en speed is identically zero, acts as a focus for the refraction
effect. There are two main types of wave behaviour: part of the wave is either
trapped by the X-line or escapes the system, and there exists a critical
starting region around the X-line that divides these two types of behaviour.
For the set-up investigated, it is found that $15.5\%$ of the fast wave energy
is trapped by the X-line. We conclude that linear, $\beta=0$ fast
magnetoacoustic waves can accumulate along X-lines and thus these will be
specific locations of fast wave energy deposition and thus preferential
heating. The work here highlights the importance of understanding the magnetic
topology of a system. We also demonstrate how the 3D WKB technique described in
this paper can be applied to other magnetic configurations.

massive and evolved stars. This will allow one to put constraints on the
circumstellar structure, on the mass ejection of dust and its reorganization ,
and on the dust-nature and formation processes. MATISSE measurements will often
be pivotal for the understanding of large multiwavelength datasets on the same
targets collected through many high-angular resolution facilities at ESO like
sub-millimeter interferometry (ALMA), near-infrared adaptive optics (NACO,

algorithm for smoothed particle magnetohydrodynamics (SPMHD) that remains
conservative with wave cleaning speeds which vary in space and time. This is
accomplished by evolving the quantity $\psi / c_h$ instead of $\psi$. Doing so
allows each particle to carry an individual wave cleaning speed, $c_h$, that
can evolve in time without needing an explicit prescription for how it should
evolve, preventing circumstances which we demonstrate could lead to runaway
energy growth related to variable wave cleaning speeds. This modification
requires only a minor adjustment to the cleaning equations and is trivial to
adopt in existing codes. Finally, we demonstrate that our constrained
hyperbolic/parabolic divergence cleaning algorithm, run for a large number of
iterations, can reduce the divergence of the field to an arbitrarily small
value, achieving $\nabla \cdot B=0$ to machine precision.

bandwidth of the front-end signal path is 1.5 GHz. Each channel has an on-chip
threshold-level discriminator that is monitored in the FPGA, from which a

'Central Card', it incorporates an Altera Arria-V FPGA that manages up to 8
front-end cards using one or two CAT5 network cables per board, which transmits
the clock and communicates data packets over a custom serial protocol. Data can
be read from the Central Card via USB, Ethernet, or dual SFP links, in addition
to the VME interface. The Central Card can be configured as either Master or

some of the most challenging real world problems of high complexity. Despite
the popularity of deep models, we still strive to better understand the
underlying mechanism that drives their success. Motivated by observations that
neurons in trained deep nets predict attributes indirectly related to the
training tasks, we recognize that a deep network learns representations more
general than the task at hand to disentangle impacts of multiple confounding
factors governing the data, in order to isolate the effects of the concerning
factors and optimize a given objective. Consequently, we propose a general
framework to augment training of deep models with information on auxiliary
explanatory data variables, in an effort to boost this disentanglement and
train deep networks that comprehend the data interactions and distributions
more accurately, and thus improve their generalizability. We incorporate
information on prominent auxiliary explanatory factors of the data population
into existing architectures as secondary objective/loss blocks that take inputs
from hidden layers during training. Once trained, these secondary circuits can
be removed to leave a model with the same architecture as the original, but
more generalizable and discerning thanks to its comprehension of data
interactions. Since pose is one of the most dominant confounding factors for
object recognition, we apply this principle to instantiate a pose-aware deep
convolutional neural network and demonstrate that auxiliary pose information
indeed improves the classification accuracy in our experiments on SAR target
classification tasks.

short gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) in two sub-classes. The ones with

short gamma-ray flashes (S-GRFs). The hardest, with $E_{iso}\gtrsim10^{52}$

(S-GRBs). Within the fireshell model, S-GRBs exhibit three different
components: the P-GRB emission, observed at the transparency of a
self-accelerating baryon-$e^+e^-$ plasma; the prompt emission, originating from
the interaction of the accelerated baryons with the circumburst medium; the
high-energy (GeV) emission, observed after the P-GRB and indicating the
formation of a BH. GRB 090510 gives the first evidence for the formation of a
Kerr BH or, possibly, a Kerr-Newman BH. Its P-GRB spectrum can be fitted by a
convolution of thermal spectra whose origin can be traced back to an axially
symmetric dyadotorus. A large value of the angular momentum of the newborn BH
is consistent with the large energetics of this S-GRB, which reach in the
1--10000 keV range $E_{iso}=(3.95\pm0.21)\times10^{52}$ erg and in the 0.1--100
GeV range $E_{LAT}=(5.78\pm0.60)\times10^{52}$ erg, the most energetic GeV
emission ever observed in S-GRBs. The theoretical redshift $z_{th}=0.75\pm0.17$

measurement $z=0.903\pm0.003$, showing the self-consistency of the theoretical
approach. All S-GRBs exhibit GeV emission, when inside the Fermi-LAT field of
view, unlike S-GRFs, which never evidence it. The GeV emission appears to be
the discriminant for the formation of a BH in GRBs, confirmed by their observed
overall energetics.

the path of the tree that is adopted by all. Since the miners can hide newly
mined nodes, they play a game with incomplete information. Here we consider two
simplified forms of this game in which the miners have complete information. In
the simplest game the miners release every mined block immediately, but are
strategic on which blocks to mine. In the second more complicated game, when a
block is mined it is announced immediately, but it may not be released so that
other miners cannot continue mining from it. A miner not only decides which
blocks to mine, but also when to release blocks to other miners. In both games,
we show that when the computational power of each miner is relatively small,
their best response matches the expected behavior of the bitcoin designer.
However, when the computational power of a miner is large, he deviates from the
expected behavior, and other Nash equilibria arise.

electrical current which depends on the phase difference $\varphi$ between the

across the junction, the Josephson effect manifests itself through a coherent
component of the heat current that flows oppositely to the thermal gradient for
$ \varphi <\pi/2$ [2-4]. The direction of both the Josephson charge and heat
currents can be inverted by adding a $\pi$ shift to $\varphi$. In the static
electrical case, this effect was obtained in a few systems, e.g. via a
ferromagnetic coupling [5,6] or a non-equilibrium distribution in the weak link
[7]. These structures opened new possibilities for superconducting quantum
logic [6,8] and ultralow power superconducting computers [9]. Here, we report
the first experimental realization of a thermal Josephson junction whose phase
bias can be controlled from $0$ to $\pi$. This is obtained thanks to a
superconducting quantum interferometer that allows to fully control the
direction of the coherent energy transfer through the junction [10]. This
possibility, joined to the completely superconducting nature of our system,
provides temperature modulations with unprecedented amplitude of $\sim$ 100 mK
and transfer coefficients exceeding 1 K per flux quantum at 25 mK. Then, this
quantum structure represents a fundamental step towards the realization of
caloritronic logic components, such as thermal transistors, switches and memory
devices [10,11]. These elements, combined with heat interferometers [3,4,12]
and diodes [13,14], would complete the thermal conversion of the most important
phase-coherent electronic devices and benefit cryogenic microcircuits requiring
energy management, such as quantum computing architectures and radiation
sensors.

fragments with mass numbers A < 8, in the case of CEM, and A < 13, in the case
of LAQGSM. Next, we modify MCNP6 to allow calculating and outputting spectra of
LF and heavier products with arbitrary mass and charge numbers. The improved

seems pertinent to explore whether the brain might use other physical
modalities than the ones that have been discovered so far. In particular it is
well established that neurons can emit photons, which prompts the question
whether these biophotons could serve as signals between neurons, in addition to
the well-known electro-chemical signals. For such communication to be targeted,
the photons would need to travel in waveguides. Here we show, based on detailed
theoretical modeling, that myelinated axons could serve as photonic waveguides,
taking into account realistic optical imperfections. We propose experiments,
both \textit{in vivo} and \textit{in vitro}, to test our hypothesis. We discuss
the implications of our results, including the question whether photons could
mediate long-range quantum entanglement in the brain.

exhibit filament tension when averaged over the meander cycle. With strong
filament curvature or medium thickness gradients, however, scroll wave dynamics
are governed by phase-locked drift instead of filament tension. Our results are

towards the north-east (NE) of the W28 supernova remnant (SNR). This cloud is
spatially well-matched to the TeV gamma-ray source HESS J1801-233 and is known
to be a SNR-molecular cloud interaction region. Shock-disruption is evident
from broad NH3 (1,1) spectral line-widths in regions towards the W28 SNR, while
strong detections of spatially-extended NH3(3,3), NH3(4,4) and NH3(6,6)
inversion emission towards the cloud strengthen the case for the existence of
high temperatures within the cloud. Velocity dispersion measurements and
NH3(n,n)/(1,1) ratio maps, where n=2, 3, 4 and 6, indicate that the source of
disruption is from the side of the cloud nearest to the W28 SNR, suggesting
that it is the source of cloud-disruption. Towards part of the cloud, the ratio
of ortho to para-NH3 is observed to exceed 2, suggesting gas-phase NH3
enrichment due to NH3 liberation from dust grain mantles. The measured NH3
abundance with respect to H2 is ~(1.2+/-0.5)*10^-9, which is not high, as might
be expected for a hot, dense molecular cloud enriched by sublimated
grain-surface molecules. The results are suggestive of NH3 sublimation and
destruction in this molecular cloud, which is likely to be interacting with the
W28 SNR shock.

encodes information in time, phase, and intensity domains, simultaneously.
While these approaches have previously been used one at a time, the proposed
scheme brings to bear for the first time their strengths simultaneously leading
to an increase in the secure information transfer rate. The proposed scheme is
applicable to both optical fibers and free space optics, and can be considered
as an alternative to polarization coding. This paper applies the proposed
compact coding scheme to multi-photon tolerant quantum protocols in order to
produce quantum-level security during information transfer. We present the
structure of the proposed coding scheme in a multi-photon environment and

applied to cross-hole slug test data collected in field tests conducted at the
Widen site in Switzerland. The model accounts for water-table effects using the
linearised kinematic condition. The model also accounts for inertial effects in
source and observation wells. The primary objective of this work is to
demonstrate applicability of this semi-analytical model to multi-well and
multi-level pneumatic slug tests. The pneumatic perturbation was applied at
discrete intervals in a source well and monitored at discrete vertical
intervals in observation wells. The source and observation well pairs were
separated by distances of up to 4 m. The analysis yielded vertical profiles of
hydraulic conductivity, specific storage, and specific yield at observation
well locations. The hydraulic parameter estimates are compared to results from
prior pumping and single-well slug tests conducted at the site, as well as to
estimates from particle size analyses of sediment collected from boreholes
during well installation. The results are in general agreement with results
from prior tests and are indicative of a sand and gravel aquifer. Sensitivity
analysis show that model identification of specific yield is strongest at
late-time. However, the usefulness of late-time data is limited due to the low
signal-to-noise ratios.

  site of CF1-ATPase","13 pages, 3 figures",,,,"q-bio.BM","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Previous kinetic models had assumed that the reaction medium was reacting at
random and without a turnover associated to thermodynamics exchanges, with a
rigid active site on the enzyme. The experimental studies show that coupling
factor 1 (CF1) from spinach chloroplasts has latent ATPase activity, which
become expressed after heat-treatment and incubation with calcium. The
sigmoidal kinetics observed on the competitive effect of glycerol on water
saturating a protein, suggests that the role of the hydration shell in the
catalytic mechanism of the CF1-ATPase, modify the number of water molecules
associated with the conformational turnover required for active site activity.
It is assume that the water associated to the hydrophilic state of the enzyme
produces a fit-in of the substrate to form (ES), follow by the catalytic action
with product formation (EP). This one induces the dissociation of water and
increases the hydrophobic attractions between R-groups. The latter, becomes the
form of the enzyme interacting with water to form the dissociated free enzyme
(E) and free product (P). Glycerol dependent suppression of the water dynamics
on two interacting sites configuration shows a change in the
H-bond-configuration. The thermodynamics modeling requires an energy
expenditure of about 4kcal/mol per each H-bond in turnover. Glycerol determined
a turnover of 14 molecules of water released from the active sites to reach the
inactive form of the enzyme. The entropy generated by turnover of the fit-in
and -out substrate and product from the protein could be dissipated-out of the
enzyme-water system itself. Coupling with the surrounding water clusters allows
to recreate H-bonds. This should involve a decrease in the number of H-bonds
present in the clusters. These changes in the mass action capability of the
water clusters could eventually become dissipated through a cooling effect.
