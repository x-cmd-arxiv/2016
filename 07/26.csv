based on pairwise interaction potentials and a range of opinion evolution
protocols ranging from random interactions to global synchronous flows in the
opinion state space. The model supports the concept of topic ""coupling"",
allowing opinions held by individuals to be changed via indirect interaction
with others on different subjects. Interaction topology is governed by a graph
that determines interactions. Our model, which is really a family of
variational models, has, as special cases, many of the previously established
models for the opinion dynamics. After introducing the model, we study the
dynamics of the special case in which the potential is either a tent function
or a constructed bell-like curve. We find that even in these relatively simple
potential function examples there emerges interesting behavior. We also present
results of preliminary numerical explorations of the behavior of the model to
motivate questions that can be explored analytically.

link prediction, has been studied extensively in the literature. Many link
prediction methods have been proposed, ranging from common neighbors to
probabilistic models. Recent work by Yang et al. has highlighted several
challenges in evaluating link prediction accuracy. In dynamic networks where
edges are both added and removed over time, the link prediction problem is more
complex and involves predicting both newly added and newly removed edges. This
results in new challenges in the evaluation of dynamic link prediction methods,
and the recommendations provided by Yang et al. are no longer applicable,
because they do not address edge removal. In this paper, we investigate several
metrics currently used for evaluating accuracies of dynamic link prediction
methods and demonstrate why they can be misleading in many cases. We provide
several recommendations on evaluating dynamic link prediction accuracy,
including separation into two categories of evaluation. Finally we propose a
unified metric to characterize link prediction accuracy effectively using a
single number.

Minimum Storage Regeneration (MSR) point. The MSR code can be constructed to
have rate $k/n$ as close to $1$ as desired, sub-packetization given by
$r^{\frac{n}{r}}$, for $r=(n-k)$, field size no larger than $n$ and where all
code symbols can be repaired with the same minimum data download. The
construction modifies a prior construction by Sasidharan et. al. which required
far larger field-size. A building block appearing in the construction is a
scalar MDS code of block length $n$. The code has a simple layered structure
with coupling across layers, that allows both node repair and data recovery to
be carried out by making multiple calls to a decoder for the scalar MDS code.
While this work was carried out independently, there is considerable overlap
with a prior construction by Ye and Barg.
  It is shown here that essentially the same architecture can be employed to
construct MSR codes using vector binary MDS codes as building blocks in place
of scalar MDS codes. The advantage here is that computations can now be carried
out over a field of smaller size potentially even over the binary field as we
demonstrate in an example. Further, we show how the construction can be
extended to handle the case of $d<(n-1)$ under a mild restriction on the choice
of helper nodes.

allows for a dual simulation in terms of worldlines where the complex action
problem is solved. Thus we can compare the DoS FFA results to the reference

model the magnetic moment induced below Tc consists of the paramagnetic
contribution of the vortex cores and the diamagnetic contribution of the

repulsive forces and occur in many physical scenarios. Liquid droplets are an
example of a self-bound system, formed by a balance of the mutual attractive
and repulsive forces that derive from different components of the
inter-particle potential. It has been suggested that self-bound ensembles of
ultracold atoms should exist for atom number densities that are 10^8 times
lower than in a helium droplet, which is formed from a dense quantum liquid.
However, such ensembles have been elusive up to now because they require forces
other than the usual zero-range contact interaction, which is either attractive
or repulsive but never both. On the basis of the recent finding that an
unstable bosonic dipolar gas can be stabilized by a repulsive many-body term,
it was predicted that three-dimensional self-bound quantum droplets of magnetic
atoms should exist. Here we report the observation of such droplets in a
trap-free levitation field. We find that this dilute magnetic quantum liquid
requires a minimum, critical number of atoms, below which the liquid evaporates
into an expanding gas as a result of the quantum pressure of the individual
constituents. Consequently, around this critical atom number we observe an
interaction-driven phase transition between a gas and a self-bound liquid in
the quantum degenerate regime with ultracold atoms. These droplets are the
dilute counterpart of strongly correlated self-bound systems such as atomic
nuclei and helium droplets.

constructed for systems of two and three spin-1/2 fermions and examples of

enlargement of the kidneys fuelled by the formation and expansion of
fluid-filled cysts. The disease is congenital and children that do not succumb
to it during the neonatal period will, by age 10 years, more often than not,
require nephrectomy+renal replacement therapy for management of both pain and
renal insufficiency. Since increasing cystic index (CI; percent of kidney
occupied by cysts) drives both renal expansion and organ dysfunction,
management of these patients, including decisions such as elective nephrectomy
and prioritization on the transplant waitlist, could clearly benefit from
serial determination of CI. So also, clinical trials in ARPKD evaluating the
efficacy of novel drug candidates could benefit from serial determination of
CI. Although ultrasound is currently the imaging modality of choice for
diagnosis of ARPKD, its utilization for assessing disease progression is highly
limited. Magnetic resonance imaging or computed tomography, although more
reliable for determination of CI, are expensive, time-consuming and somewhat
impractical in the pediatric population. Using a well-established mammalian
model of ARPKD, we undertook a big data-like analysis of minimally- or
non-invasive serum and urine biomarkers of renal injury/dysfunction to derive a
family of equations for estimating CI. We then applied a signal averaging
protocol to distill these equations to a single empirical formula for
calculation of CI. Such a formula will eventually find use in identifying and
monitoring patients at high risk for progressing to end-stage renal disease and
aid in the conduct of clinical trials.

production of a solar photovoltaic is assumed to be consumed by a finite number
of discrete loads in an off-grid system using mixed-integer linear programming.
Additional constraints are battery charge and discharge limitations and minimum
uptime and downtime for each unit. For a certain solar power profile the model
outputs optimal unit size as well as the optimal scheduling for both units and
battery charge and discharge (if applicable). The impact of different solar
power profiles and minimum up and down time constraints on the optimal unit and
battery sizes are studied. The battery size required to achieve full solar
energy utilization decreases with the number of units and with increased
flexibility of the units (shorter on and off-time). A novel formulation is
introduced to model quasi-dynamic units that gradually start and stop and the
quasi-dynamic units increase solar energy utilization. The model can also be
applied to search for the optimal number of units for a given cost function.

approach is unique and versatile as it allows scheduling of electrical loads
that each have their own dynamic power demand during on/off switching, while
also allowing the specification of minimum on/off times for each loads
separately. The optimization approach is formulated as a parallel enumeration
of all possible on/off times of the electrical loads using a moving time
approach in which only a short term power production forecast is needed, while
at the same time taking into account constraints on electrical energy storage
and power delivery of a battery system. It is shown that the complexity of the
optimization (number of enumerations) is limited by the number of data points
in the short term power production forecast and the minimum on/off time of the
electrical loads. The limited complexity along with parallel enumeration allows
real-time operational scheduling of a large number of loads. The simulation
results shown in this paper illustrate that relatively short term power

10^{-5}~\mathrm{yr^{-1}}$ per comet. The low dormancy rate confirms disruption
and dynamical removal as the dominant end state for near-Earth JFCs. We also
predict the existence of a significant number of meteoroid streams whose

on the strain gradient elasticity theory, which is intended to explain the
phenomenon of size effect at the micron scale. Spectral properties of the
corresponding state operator are studied; an asymptotic expression for
eigenvalues is calculated, and eigenfunctions are analyzed in order to check
the necessary conditions for the exact observability of the system. By
examining the eigenfunctions, it is shown that among non-collocated boundary
outputs, only measurement of the non-classical moment at the root of the beam
yields an admissible observation operator and also defines an exactly

parameters (wavelength and intensity) lead to unexpected Zero-Width Resonances
(ZWR), with in principle infinite lifetimes. Their interest in inducing basic
quenching mechanisms have recently been devised in the laser control of
vibrational cooling through filtration strategies [O. Atabek et al., Phys. Rev.
A87, 031403(R) (2013)]. A full quantum adiabatic control theory based on the
adiabatic Floquet Hamiltonian is developed to show how a laser pulse could be
envelop-shaped and frequency-chirped so as to protect a given initial
vibrational state against dissociation, taking advantage from its continuous
transport on the corresponding ZWR, all along the pulse duration. As compared
with previous control scenarios actually suffering from non-adiabatic
contamination, drastically different and much more efficient filtration goals
are achieved. A semiclassical analysis helps in finding and interpreting a
complete map of ZWRs in the laser parameter plane. In addition, the choice of a
given ZWR path, among the complete series identified by the semiclassical
approach, amounts to be crucial for the cooling scheme, targeting a single
vibrational state population left at the end of the pulse, while all others
have almost completely decayed. The illustrative example, offering the
potentiality to be transposed to other diatomics, is Na2 prepared by
photoassociation in vibrationally hot but translationally and rotationally cold
states.

convergence is the same and equals $n^{-rH}$, where $n$ is a number of the

  Cascaded Bilateral Sampling",,,,,"cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Matrix sketching is aimed at finding close approximations of a matrix by
factors of much smaller dimensions, which has important applications in
optimization and machine learning. Given a matrix A of size m by n,
state-of-the-art randomized algorithms take O(m * n) time and space to obtain
its low-rank decomposition. Although quite useful, the need to store or
manipulate the entire matrix makes it a computational bottleneck for truly
large and dense inputs. Can we sketch an m-by-n matrix in O(m + n) cost by
accessing only a small fraction of its rows and columns, without knowing
anything about the remaining data? In this paper, we propose the cascaded
bilateral sampling (CABS) framework to solve this problem. We start from
demonstrating how the approximation quality of bilateral matrix sketching
depends on the encoding powers of sampling. In particular, the sampled rows and
columns should correspond to the code-vectors in the ground truth
decompositions. Motivated by this analysis, we propose to first generate a
pilot-sketch using simple random sampling, and then pursue more advanced,
""follow-up"" sampling on the pilot-sketch factors seeking maximal encoding
powers. In this cascading process, the rise of approximation quality is shown
to be lower-bounded by the improvement of encoding powers in the follow-up
sampling step, thus theoretically guarantees the algorithmic boosting property.
Computationally, our framework only takes linear time and space, and at the
same time its performance rivals the quality of state-of-the-art algorithms
consuming a quadratic amount of resources. Empirical evaluations on benchmark
data fully demonstrate the potential of our methods in large scale matrix
sketching and related areas.

for the energy and coherence loss. We consider the next order non-linearity,
represented by the Hamiltonian $({a}^{\dag} a)^3$, where we observe the
phenomena of super revivals. The effect of dissipation in this case has an
additional feature of number dependence for the displaced number states. While

the $\vartheta$-invariant subgroup of the unipotent subgroup $N \subset G$,

substrate tip with height $h_1$, radius $r_{1}$ and characteristic field
enhancement factor (FEF) $\gamma_1$, and the top nanostructure with height
$h_2$, radius $r_{2}<r_{1}$ and FEF $\gamma_2$, both hemisphere on post-like

characteristic FEF, $\gamma_{C}$. Defining the relative difference $\eta_R
\equiv (\gamma_{C} - \gamma_{1})/ (\gamma_{3} - \gamma_{1})$, where
$\gamma_{3}$ corresponds to reference FEF for a hemisphere on post structure
with radius $r_3=r_2$ and height $h_3=h_1 + h_2$, our results suggest, from
numerical solution of Laplace's equation using a finite element scheme, a
scaling $\eta_R = f(u\equiv\lambda\theta^{-1})$, where $\lambda\equiv
h_{2}/h_1$ and $\theta \equiv r_1/r_2$. Given a characteristic variable
$u_{c}$, we found, for $u \ll u_{c}$, a power law $\eta_{R} \sim u^{\kappa}$
with $\kappa \approx 0.55$. For $u \gg u_{c}$, $\eta_{R} \approx 1$ providing
conditions where $\gamma_C \rightarrow \gamma_3$. As a consequence of scaling
invariance, it's possible to derive a simple expression for $\gamma_C$, being
possible to predict conditions to produce related systems with a desirable FEF
and that, at the same time, are mechanically stable by presence of substrate
tip. Finally, we also discuss the validity of Schottky's conjecture (SC) for
these systems showing that, while to obey SC is a indicative of scale
invariance, the opposite is not necessarily satisfied. This suggest that a
careful analysis must be done before attribute the SC as a origin of giant FEF

must be polynomial in nature if their frequency is purely imaginary, and
present a method for computing such modes. The nature of these modes, however,

known for Schwarzschild black holes, but clarifies misconceptions for the
behavior of modes when the black hole has angular momentum. We also show that
the algebraically special modes of Kerr with m=0 have an additional branch of
solutions not seen before in the literature. All of these results are in
precise agreement with new numerical solutions for sequences of gravitational
quasinormal modes of Kerr. However, we show that some prior numerical and

the slope of the inner density profile of galaxy haloes with different

inner slope of the galaxy halo density profile, $\alpha$, and the stellar mass,
$M_{*}$, or rotation velocity $V_{\rm rot}$. For this, we use the model of Del
Popolo (2009) in combination with observed data from the Romanowsky \& Fall
(2012) sample of elliptical and spiral galaxies, the Local Group sample
compiled by McConnachie (2012), and the simulation results by Cloet-Osselaer et
al. (2014). We find that the slope $\alpha$ flattens monotonically, from
$\alpha \simeq -1 $ at $V_{\rm rot} \simeq 250$ km/s, to $\alpha \simeq 0 $.
After $V_{\rm rot}\simeq 25$ km/s the slope starts to steepen. The steepening
happens in the mass range dominated by non-rotationally supported galaxies
(e.g., dSphs) and depends on the level of offset in the angular momentum of
rotationally and non-rotationally dominated galaxies. The steepening is a
consequence of the decrease in baryons content, and angular momentum in
spheroidal dwarf galaxies. We finally compare our result to the SPH simulations
of Di Cintio. Our result is in qualitatively agreement with their simulations,
with the main difference that the inner slope $\alpha$ at small stellar masses
($M_* \lesssim10^{8} M_{\odot}$) is flatter than that in their simulations. As
a result, the claim that finding a core in dwarf galaxies with masses slightly
smaller than $\simeq 10^6 M_{\odot}$, (as in the Di Cintio, or Governato,
supernovae feedback mechanism) would be a problem for the $\Lambda$CDM model
must be probably revised.

difference scheme for multi-dimensional problems without dimensional splitting.
The semi-Lagrangian scheme, based on tracing characteristics backward in time
from grid points, does not necessarily conserve the total mass. To ensure mass
conservation, we propose a conservative correction procedure based on a flux
difference form. Such procedure guarantees local mass conservation, while
introducing time step constraints for stability. We theoretically investigate
such stability constraints from an ODE point of view by assuming exact
evaluation of spatial differential operators and from the Fourier analysis for
linear PDEs.
  The scheme is tested by classical two dimensional linear passive-transport
problems, such as linear advection, rotation and swirling deformation. The
scheme is applied to solve the nonlinear Vlasov-Poisson system using a a high
order tracing mechanism proposed in [Qiu and Russo, 2016]. Such high order
characteristics tracing scheme is generalized to the nonlinear guiding center
Vlasov model and incompressible Euler system. The effectiveness of the proposed
conservative semi-Lagrangian scheme is demonstrated numerically by our
extensive numerical tests.

  The first question is to define topological entropy for a topological
dynamical system $(f,X,\Omega )$. The main idea is to make use - in addition to
invariant compact subspaces of $(X,\Omega )$ - of compactifications of \'etale
covers $\pi :(f',X',\Omega ')\rightarrow (f,X,\Omega )$, that is $\pi \circ
f'=f\circ \pi$ and the fibers of $\pi $ are all finite. We prove some basic
results and propose a conjecture, whose validity allows us to prove further
results.
  The second question is to define topological entropy for algebraic dynamical
systems, with the requirement that it should be as close to the pullback on
cohomology groups as possible. To this end, we develop an \'etale analog of
algebraic dynamical systems.

criteria, for global existence and uniqueness of classical solutions to the
three-dimensional relativistic Vlasov-Maxwell system. In the compact momentum
support setting, we prove that $\|p_{0}^{\frac{18}{5r} -
1+\beta}f\|_{L^{\infty}_{t}L^{r}_{x}L^{1}_{p}} \lesssim 1$, where $1\leq r \leq
2$ and $\beta >0$ is arbitrarily small, is a continuation criteria. The
previously best known continuation criteria in the compact setting is
$\|p_{0}^{\frac{4}{r} - 1+\beta}f\|_{L^{\infty}_{t}L^{r}_{x}L^{1}_{p}} \lesssim
1$, where $1\leq r < \infty$ and $\beta >0$ is arbitrarily small, is due to
work by Kunze. Thus, our continuation criteria is an improvement in the $1\leq
r \leq 2$ range. In addition, we consider also sufficient conditions for a
global existence result to the three-dimensional relativistic Vlasov-Maxwell
system without compact support in momentum space, building on previous work by
Luk-Strain. In their work, it was shown that
$\|p_{0}^{\theta}f\|_{L^{1}_{x}L^{1}_{p}} \lesssim 1$ is a continuation
criteria for the relativistic Vlasov-Maxwell system without compact support in
momentum space for $\theta > 5$. We improve this result to $\theta > 3$. We
also build on another result by Luk-Strain, in which the authors proved the
existence of a global classical solution in the compact momentum support
setting given the condition that there exists a two-dimensional plane on which
the momentum support of the particle density remains fixed. We prove
well-posedness even if the plane varies continuously in time.

origin of the faint unidentified E=3.5 keV emission line reported in several
low-resolution studies of various massive systems, such as galaxies and
clusters, including the Perseus cluster. We have analyzed the Hitomi
first-light observation of the Perseus cluster. The emission line expected for
Perseus based on the XMM-Newton signal from the large cluster sample under the
dark matter decay scenario is too faint to be detectable in the Hitomi data.
However, the previously reported 3.5 keV flux from Perseus was anomalously high
compared to the sample-based prediction. We find no unidentified line at the
reported high flux level. Taking into account the XMM measurement uncertainties
for this region, the inconsistency with Hitomi is at a 99% significance for a
broad dark-matter line and at 99.7% for a narrow line from the gas. We do not
find anomalously high fluxes of the nearby faint K line or the Ar satellite
line that were proposed as explanations for the earlier 3.5 keV detections. We
do find a hint of a broad excess near the energies of high-n transitions of
Sxvi (E=3.44 keV rest-frame) -- a possible signature of charge exchange in the
molecular nebula and another proposed explanation for the unidentified line.
While its energy is consistent with XMM pn detections, it is unlikely to
explain the MOS signal. A confirmation of this interesting feature has to wait
for a more sensitive observation with a future calorimeter experiment.

entering into a strong-coupling regime, by redistributing the energy among many
weakly-interacting soft quanta. In this way, the scattering process of some
initial hard quanta splits into a large number of soft elementary processes. In
short, the theory trades the strong coupling for a high-multiplicity of quanta.
At very high energies, the outcome of such a scattering experiment is a
production of soft states of high occupation number that are approximately
classical. It is evident that black hole creation in particle collision at
super-Planckian energies is a result of classicalization, but there is no a
priory reason why this phenomenon must be limited to gravity. If the hierarchy
problem is solved by classicalization, the LHC has a chance of detecting a
tower of new resonances. The lowest-lying resonances must appear right at the
strong coupling scale in form of short-lived elementary particles. The heavier
members of the tower must behave more and more classically: they must be longer

for single class classification and outlier detection. SVDD based K-chart was
first introduced by Sun and Tsung for monitoring multivariate processes when
underlying distribution of process parameters or quality characteristics depart
from Normality. The method first trains a SVDD model on data obtained from
stable or in-control operations of the process to obtain a threshold $R^2$ and
kernel center a. For each new observation, its Kernel distance from the Kernel
center a is calculated. The kernel distance is compared against the threshold
$R^2$ to determine if the observation is within the control limits. The
non-parametric K-chart provides an attractive alternative to the traditional
control charts such as the Hotelling's $T^2$ charts when distribution of the
underlying multivariate data is either non-normal or is unknown. But there are
challenges when K-chart is deployed in practice. The K-chart requires
calculating kernel distance of each new observation but there are no guidelines
on how to interpret the kernel distance plot and infer about shifts in process
mean or changes in process variation. This limits the application of K-charts
in big-data applications such as equipment health monitoring, where
observations are generated at a very high frequency. In this scenario, the
analyst using the K-chart is inundated with kernel distance results at a very
high frequency, generally without any recourse for detecting presence of any
assignable causes of variation. We propose a new SVDD based control chart,
called as $K_T$ chart, which addresses challenges encountered when using
K-chart for big-data applications. The $K_T$ charts can be used to
simultaneously track process variation and central tendency. We illustrate the
successful use of $K_T$ chart using the Tennessee Eastman process data.

optimal protocols is challenging, requiring detailed information about the
dynamical fluctuations of the controlled system. We provide a new, physically
transparent derivation of a metric tensor for which the length of a protocol is
proportional to its dissipation. This perspective simplifies nonequilibrium
optimization problems by recasting them in a geometric language. We then
describe a numerical method, an instance of geometric minimum action methods,
that enables computation of geodesics even when the number of control
parameters is large. We apply these methods to two models of nanomagnetic bits:
a simple Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert description of a single magnetic spin
controlled by two orthogonal magnetic fields and a two dimensional Ising model
in which the field is spatially controlled. These calculations reveal
nontrivial protocols for bit erasure and reversal, providing important,

are rectifiable in terms of doubling metric measure spaces satisfying some

spaces admitting a strong form of a differentiability structure in the sense of
Cheeger, and provides a partial converse to his theorem. The proof is based on
a new `thickening' construction, which can be used to enlarge subsets into
spaces admitting Poincar\'e inequalities. We also introduce a new notion of
quantitative connectivity which characterizes spaces satisfying local
Poincar\'e inequalities. This characterization is of independent interest, and
has several applications separate from differentiability spaces. We resolve a
question of Tapio Rajala on the existence of Poincar\'e inequalities for the

deforming a geodesic metric measure space by Muckenhoupt weights preserves the

high-quality multi-label annotations for temporal data such as videos. Watching
even a short 30-second video clip requires a significant time investment from a
crowd worker; thus, requesting multiple annotations following a single viewing
is an important cost-saving strategy. But how many questions should we ask per
video? We conclude that the optimal strategy is to ask as many questions as
possible in a HIT (up to 52 binary questions after watching a 30-second video
clip in our experiments). We demonstrate that while workers may not correctly
answer all questions, the cost-benefit analysis nevertheless favors consensus
from multiple such cheap-yet-imperfect iterations over more complex
alternatives. When compared with a one-question-per-video baseline, our method
is able to achieve a 10% improvement in recall 76.7% ours versus 66.7%

steered molecular dynamics (SMD) simulations, performed to obtain potentials of
mean force (PMFs) of molecular systems using non-equilibrium work (NEW)
theorems. Harmonic guiding potentials are also the natural choice in single
molecule force spectroscopy experiments. The stiff spring approximation (SSA)
of Schulten and coworkers enables to use the work performed along SMD
trajectories to obtain the PMF.
  We discuss and demonstrate how a high spring constant, k, required for the
validity of the SSA can violate another requirement of this theory, i.e., the
validity of Brownian dynamics of the system. Violation of the Brownian
condition results in the introduction of kinetic energy contributions to the
external work, performed during SMD simulations. These inertial effects result
in skewed work distributions, rather than the Gaussian distributions predicted
by SSA. The inertial effects also result in broader work distributions, which
worsen the effect of the skewness when calculating work averages. Remarkably,
our results strongly suggest that the skew and width of work distributions are
independent of the average drift velocity and physical asymmetries.
  The skew and broadening of work distributions result in biased estimation of
the PMF. The bias manifests itself in the form of a systematic error that
increases with simulation time. We discuss the proper upper limit for k, such
that the inertial effects are avoided. This limit, used together with the
relation for the lower limit of k, enables to conduct accurate steering while
satisfying the Brownian dynamics. Furthermore, we argue and demonstrate that
using the peak-value (rather than the statistical mean) of the work
distributions vastly reduces the bias in the calculated PMFs and improves the
accuracy.

Examining
both engineered and natural communications networks reveals an unsuspected
order that depends on contact with an unpredictable entity. This order has
three roots. The first is a proof within quantum theory that no evidence can
ever determine its explanation, so that an agent choosing an explanation must
do so unpredictably. The second root is the showing that clocks that step
computers do not ""tell time"" but serve as self-adjusting symbol-handling agents
that regulate ""logically synchronized"" motion in response to unpredictable
disturbances. Such a clock-agent has a certain independence as well as the
capacity to communicate via unpredictable symbols with other clock-agents and
to adjust its own tick rate in response to that communication. The third root
is the noticing of unpredictable symbol exchange in natural systems, including
the transmission of symbols found in molecular biology. We introduce a
symbol-handling agent as a role played in some cases by a person, for example a
physicist who chooses an explanation of given experimental outcomes, and in
other cases by some other biological entity, and in still other cases by an
inanimate device, such as a computer-based detector used in physical
measurements. While we forbear to try to explain the propensity of agents at
all levels from cells to civilizations to form and operate networks of
logically synchronized symbol-handling agents, we point to this propensity as
an overlooked cosmic order, an order structured by the unpredictability ensuing
from the proof. Appreciating the cosmic order leads to a conception of agency
that replaces volition by unpredictability and re-conceives the notion of
objectivity in a way that makes a place for agency in the world as described by

is important to understand the systematic effects associated with the
instrument and the analysis pipeline. A common approach to tackle this is to
forward-model the entire system - from the hardware to the analysis of the data
products. For this purpose, we introduce two newly developed, open-source
Python packages: the HI Data Emulator (HIDE) and the Signal Extraction and
Emission Kartographer (SEEK) for simulating and processing single-dish radio
survey data. HIDE forward-models the process of collecting astronomical radio
signals in a single-dish radio telescope instrument and outputs pixel-level
time-ordered-data. SEEK processes the time-ordered-data, removes artifacts from
Radio Frequency Interference (RFI), automatically applies flux calibration, and
aims to recover the astronomical radio signal. The two packages can be used
separately or together depending on the application. Their modular and flexible
nature allows easy adaptation to other instruments and data sets. We describe
the basic architecture of the two packages and examine in detail the noise and
RFI modeling in HIDE, as well as the implementation of gain calibration and RFI
mitigation in SEEK. We then apply HIDE & SEEK to forward-model a Galactic
survey in the frequency range 990 - 1260 MHz based on data taken at the Bleien
Observatory. For this survey, we expect to cover 70% of the full sky and
achieve a median signal-to-noise ratio of approximately 5 - 6 in the cleanest

We analyzed deep XMM-Newton Reflection Grating Spectrometer (RGS) data in five
adjacent spectral regions in the central parts of the NGC 4636 galaxy group. We
examined the suppression of the Fe xvii resonance line (15.01 {\AA}) as
compared to the forbidden lines of the same ion (17.05 {\AA} and 17.10 {\AA}).
The presence and radial dependence of the cooling flow was investigated through
spectral modeling. In addition, a parallel analysis with deep Chandra Advances
CCD Imaging Spectrometer (ACIS) data was conducted to gain additional
information about the thermodynamical properties of the IGM. We find that the
plasma at the group center to the north shows efficient Fe xvii ion resonant
scattering, wheras no resonant scattering was detected at the south side. The
regions featuring resonant scattering coincide with those embodying large
amounts of cool ($kT\lesssim0.4$ keV) gas phases, and the spectral imprints of
cooling gas with a total mass deposition rate of $\sim0.8$ M$_{\odot}$
yr$^{-1}$ within the examined region of $2.4^{\prime}\times 5.0^{\prime}$. We
interpret the results as possible evidence of asymmetric turbulence
distribution in the NGC 4636 IGM: Turbulence dominates the gas dynamics to the
south, while collective gas motions characterize the dynamics to the north.
X-ray images show imprints of energetic AGN at both sides, yet we find evidence
of turbulence heating at the south and gas cooling at the north of the core. We
infer that the observed asymmetry may be the result of the specific observation
angle to the source, or arise from the turbulence driven by core sloshing at
south side.

are rapidly forming young stars, and `red-sequence' galaxies in which star
formation has almost completely ceased. Most galaxies more massive than
$3\times10^{10} M_\odot$ follow the red-sequence while less massive central
galaxies lie on the blue sequence. We show that these sequences are created by
a competition between star formation-driven outflows and gas accretion on to
the supermassive black hole at the galaxy's center. We develop a simple
analytic model for this interaction. In galaxies less massive than
$3\times10^{10} M_\odot$, young stars and supernovae drive a high entropy
outflow that is more buoyant that any diffuse corona. The outflow balances the
rate of gas inflow, preventing high gas densities building up in the central
regions. More massive galaxies, however, are surrounded by a hot corona. We
argue that above a halo mass of $\sim 10^{12} M_\odot$, the supernova-driven
outflow is no longer buoyant and star formation is unable to prevent the build
up of gas in the central regions. This triggers a strongly non-linear response
from the black hole. Its accretion rate rises rapidly, heating the galaxy's
corona, disrupting the incoming supply of cool gas and starving the galaxy of
the fuel for star formation. The host galaxy makes a transition to the red
sequence, and further growth predominantly occurs through galaxy mergers. We
show that the analytic model provides a good description of galaxy evolution in
the EAGLE hydrodynamic simulations, and demonstrate that, so long as star
formation-driven outflows are present, the transition mass scale is almost
independent of subgrid parameter choice. The transition mass disappears
entirely, however, if star formation driven outflows are absent.

bounds on minimal extensions of the standard model by (vector-like) fermionic
or scalar gauge multiplets. Within, we advocate for an intuitive and physical
concept of naturalness built upon the renormalisation group equations. In the
effective field theory of the standard model plus a gauge multiplet with mass
$M$, the low scale Higgs mass parameter is a calculable function of
$\overline{\rm MS}$ input parameters defined at some high scale $\Lambda_h >
M$. If the Higgs mass is very sensitive to these input parameters, then this
signifies a naturalness problem. To sensibly capture the sensitivity, it is
shown how a sensitivity measure can be rigorously derived as a Bayesian model
comparison, which reduces in a relevant limit to a Barbieri--Giudice-like
fine-tuning measure. This measure is fully generalisable to any perturbative
EFT. The interesting results of our two-loop renormalisation group study are as
follows: for $\Lambda_h=\Lambda_{Pl}$ we find ""$10\%$ fine-tuning"" bounds on
the masses of various gauge multiplets of $M<\mathcal{O}(1$--$10)$ TeV, with
bounds on fermionic gauge multiplets significantly weaker than for scalars;
these bounds remain finite in the limit $\Lambda_h\to M^+$, weakening to
$M<\mathcal{O}(10$--$100)$ TeV; and bounds on coloured multiplets are no more
severe than for electroweak multiplets, since they only directly correct the
Higgs mass at three-loop.

r-process material ([Eu/Fe]~1.7), in contrast to the extremely low
neutron-capture element abundances found in every other ultra-faint dwarf
galaxy studied to date. The other two stars are the most metal-poor stars in
the system ([Fe/H] < -3), and they have neutron-capture element abundance
limits similar to those in other ultra-faint dwarf galaxies. We confirm that
the relative abundances of Sr, Y, and Zr in these stars are similar to those
found in r-process halo stars but ~0.5 dex lower than the solar r-process
pattern. If the universal r-process pattern extends to those elements, the
stars in Ret II display the least contaminated known r-process pattern. The
abundances of lighter elements up to the iron peak are otherwise similar to
abundances of stars in the halo and in other ultra-faint dwarf galaxies.
However, the scatter in abundance ratios is large enough to suggest that
inhomogeneous metal mixing is required to explain the chemical evolution of
this galaxy. The presence of low amounts of neutron-capture elements in other
ultra-faint dwarf galaxies may imply the existence of additional r-process
sites besides the source of r-process elements in Ret II. Galaxies like Ret II
may be the original birth sites of r-process enhanced stars now found in the

charged particles with strong electromagnetic fields. A general result is that
integrability of the dynamics is lost when going from lightlike to timelike or
spacelike field dependence. For a special scenario in the classical regime we
show how the radiation spectrum in the spacelike (undulator) case becomes
well-approximated by the plane wave model in the high energy limit, despite the
two systems being Lorentz inequivalent. In the quantum problem, there is no
analogue of the WKB-exact Volkov solution. Nevertheless, WKB and uniform-WKB
approaches give good approximations in all cases considered. Other approaches
that reduce the underlying differential equations from second to first order
are found to miss the correct physics for situations corresponding to barrier
transmission and wide-angle scattering.

ground-based detectors such as Advanced LIGO. Neutron-rich material ejected by
these mergers may also be the main source of r-process elements in the
Universe, while radioactive decays in the ejecta can power bright
electromagnetic post-merger signals. Neutrino-matter interactions play a
critical role in the evolution of the composition of the ejected material,
which significantly impacts the outcome of nucleosynthesis and the properties
of the associated electromagnetic signal. In this work, we present a simulation
of a binary neutron star merger using an improved method for estimating the
average neutrino energies in our energy-integrated neutrino transport scheme.
These energy estimates are obtained by evolving the neutrino number density in
addition to the neutrino energy and flux densities. We show that significant
changes are observed in the composition of the polar ejecta when comparing our
new results with earlier simulations in which the neutrino spectrum was assumed
to be the same everywhere in optically thin regions. In particular, we find
that material ejected in the polar regions is less neutron rich than previously
estimated. Our new estimates of the composition of the polar ejecta make it
more likely that the color and timescale of the electromagnetic signal depend
on the orientation of the binary with respect to an observer's line-of-sight.
These results also indicate that important observable properties of neutron
star mergers are sensitive to the neutrino energy spectrum, and may need to be
studied through simulations including a more accurate, energy-dependent
neutrino transport scheme.

observations from the IRAM PdBI, with the aim of studying the structure and
fragmentation of the filamentary Infrared Dark Cloud G035.39-00.33. The
continuum emission is segmented into a series of 13 quasi-regularly spaced
(~0.18pc) cores, following the major axis of the IRDC. We compare the spatial
distribution of the cores with that predicted by theoretical work describing
the fragmentation of hydrodynamic fluid cylinders, finding a significant (a
factor of ~8) discrepancy between the two. Our observations are consistent with
the picture emerging from kinematic studies of molecular clouds suggesting that
the cores are harboured within a complex network of independent sub-filaments.
This result emphasizes the importance of considering the underlying physical
structure, and potentially, dynamically important magnetic fields, in any
fragmentation analysis. The identified cores exhibit a range in (peak)
beam-averaged column density ($3.6{\rm x}10^{23}{\rm cm}^{-2}<N_{H,c}<8.0{\rm
x}10^{23}{\rm cm}^{-2}$), mass ($8.1M_{\odot}<M_{c}<26.1M_{\odot}$), and number
density ($6.1{\rm x}10^{5}{\rm cm}^{-3}<n_{H, c, eq}<14.7{\rm x}10^{5}{\rm
cm}^{-3}$). Two of these cores, dark in the mid-infrared,
centrally-concentrated, monolithic (with no traceable substructure at our PdBI
resolution), and with estimated masses of the order ~20-25$M_{\odot}$, are good
candidates for the progenitors of intermediate-to-high-mass stars. Virial
parameters span a range $0.2<\alpha_{\rm vir}<1.3$. Without additional support,
possibly from dynamically important magnetic fields with strengths of the order
230$\mu$G<B<670$\mu$G, the cores are susceptible to gravitational collapse.
These results may imply a multilayered fragmentation process, which
incorporates the formation of sub-filaments, embedded cores, and the
possibility of further fragmentation.

physically motivated model of the low-frequency radio sky from 22 MHz to 23
GHz. GMOSS invokes different physical components and associated radiative
processes to describe the sky spectrum over 3072 pixels of $5^{\circ}$
resolution. The spectra are allowed to be convex, concave or of more complex
form with contributions from synchrotron emission, thermal emission and
free-free absorption included. Physical parameters that describe the model are
optimized to best fit four all-sky maps at 150 MHz, 408 MHz, 1420 MHz and 23
GHz and two maps at 22 MHz and 45 MHz generated using the Global Sky Model of
de Oliveira-Costa et al. (2008). The fractional deviation of model to data has
a median value of $6\%$ and is less than $17\%$ for $99\%$ of the pixels.
Though aimed at modeling of foregrounds for the global signal arising from the
redshifted 21-cm line of Hydrogen during Cosmic Dawn and Epoch of Reionization
(EoR) - over redshifts $150\lesssim z \lesssim 6$, GMOSS is well suited for any
application that requires simulating spectra of the low-frequency radio sky as
would be observed by the beam of any instrument. The complexity in spectral
structure that naturally arises from the underlying physics of the model
provides a useful expectation for departures from smoothness in EoR foreground
spectra and hence may guide the development of algorithms for EoR signal
detection. This aspect is further explored in a subsequent paper.

the enhancement of T * in SmB6 under the application of tensile strain. With
0.7% tensile strain we report surface dominated conduction at up to a

can be explained in the framework of strain-tuned temporal and spatial
fluctuations of f-electron configurations, which might be generally applied to
other mixed-valence materials. We note that this amount of strain can be indued
in epitaxial SmB6 films via substrate in potential device applications.

young star's protoplanetary disk, a signature of which may be a localized
disturbance in the disk's radial and/or vertical structure. Using time-series
photometric observations by the Kilodegree Extremely Little Telescope South
(KELT-South) project and the All-Sky Automated Survey for SuperNovae (ASAS-SN),
combined with archival observations, we present the discovery of two extended
dimming events of the young star, DM Ori. This young system faded by $\sim$1.5
mag from 2000 March to 2002 August and then again in 2013 January until 2014
September (depth $\sim$1.7 mag). We constrain the duration of the 2000-2002
dimming to be $<$ 860 days, and the event in 2013-2014 to be $<$ 585 days,
separated by $\sim$12.5 years. A model of the spectral energy distribution
(SED) indicates a large infrared excess consistent with an extensive
circumstellar disk. Using basic kinematic arguments, we propose that DM Ori is
likely being periodically occulted by a feature (possibly a warp or
perturbation) in its circumstellar disk. In this scenario, the occulting
feature is located $>$6 AU from the host star, moving at $\sim$14.6 km/s, and
is $\sim$4.9 AU in width. This localized structure may indicate a disturbance
such as may be caused by a protoplanet early in its formation.

binary neutron star systems and neutron-star--black-hole systems during the
first observing run of Advanced LIGO. In particular we searched for
gravitational wave signals from binary neutron star systems with component
masses $\in [1,3] M_{\odot}$ and component dimensionless spins $< 0.05$. We
also searched for neutron-star--black-hole systems with the same neutron star
parameters, black hole mass $\in [2,99] M_{\odot}$ and no restriction on the
black hole spin magnitude. We assess the sensitivity of the two LIGO detectors
to these systems, and find that they could have detected the merger of binary
neutron star systems with component mass distributions of $1.35\pm0.13
M_{\odot}$ at a volume-weighted average distance of $\sim$ 70Mpc, and for
neutron-star--black-hole systems with neutron star masses of $1.4M_\odot$ and
black hole masses of at least $5M_\odot$, a volume-weighted average distance of
at least $\sim$ 110Mpc. From this we constrain with 90% confidence the merger
rate to be less than 12,600 Gpc$^{-3}$yr$^{-1}$ for binary-neutron star systems
and less than 3,600 Gpc$^{-3}$yr$^{-1}$ for neutron-star--black-hole systems.
We find that if no detection of neutron-star binary mergers is made in the next
two Advanced LIGO and Advanced Virgo observing runs we would place significant
constraints on the merger rates. Finally, assuming a rate of
$10^{+20}_{-7}$Gpc$^{-3}$yr$^{-1}$ short gamma ray bursts beamed towards the
Earth and assuming that all short gamma-ray bursts have binary-neutron-star
(neutron-star--black-hole) progenitors we can use our 90% confidence rate upper
limits to constrain the beaming angle of the gamma-ray burst to be greater than
${2.3^{+1.7}_{-1.1}}^{\circ}$ (${4.3^{+3.1}_{-1.9}}^{\circ}$).

disk physics in an extreme parameter regime. In this paper we investigate a
sample of 29 well-characterized brown dwarfs and very low mass stars, for which
Herschel far-infrared fluxes as well as (sub)-mm fluxes are available. We have
measured new Herschel PACS fluxes for 11 objects and complement these with
(sub)-mm data and Herschel fluxes from the literature. We analyze their
spectral energy distributions in comparison with results from radiative
transfer modeling. Fluxes in the far-infrared are strongly affected by the
shape and temperature of the disk (and hence stellar luminosity), whereas the
(sub)-mm fluxes mostly depend on disk mass. Nevertheless, there is a clear
correlation between far-infrared and (sub)-mm fluxes. We argue that the link
results from the combination of the stellar mass-luminosity relation and a
scaling between disk mass and stellar mass. We find strong evidence of dust
settling to the disk midplane. The spectral slopes between near- and
far-infrared are mostly between $-0.5$ and $-1.2$ in our sample, comparable to
more massive T Tauri stars, which may imply that the disk shapes are similar as
well, though highly-flared disks are rare among brown dwarfs. We find that dust
temperatures in the range of 7-15 K, calculated with
$T\approx25\,(L/L_\odot)^{0.25}$ K, are appropriate for deriving disk masses
from (sub)-mm fluxes for these low luminosity objects. About half of our sample
hosts disks with at least one Jupiter mass, confirming that many brown dwarfs
harbour sufficient material for the formation of Earth-mass planets in their
midst.

plasma turbulence ubiquitously generate coherent structures, in the form of
current sheets, at small scales, and the locations of these current sheets
appear to be associated with enhanced rates of dissipation of the turbulent
energy. Therefore, illuminating the origin and nature of these current sheets
is critical to identifying the dominant physical mechanisms of dissipation, a
primary aim at the forefront of plasma turbulence research. Here we present
evidence from nonlinear gyrokinetic simulations that strong nonlinear
interactions between counterpropagating Alfven waves, or strong Alfven wave
collisions, are a natural mechanism for the generation of current sheets in
plasma turbulence. Furthermore, we conceptually explain this current sheet
development in terms of the nonlinear dynamics of Alfven wave collisions,
showing that these current sheets arise through constructive interference among
the initial Alfven waves and nonlinearly generated modes. The properties of
current sheets generated by a strong Alfven wave collisions are compared to
published observations of current sheets in the Earth's magnetosheath and the
solar wind, and the nature of these current sheets leads to the expectation
that Landau damping of the constituent Alfven waves plays a dominant role in
the damping of turbulently generated current sheets.

small discrete rings with $3\leq N\leq 6$ sites and $N_{e}<2N$ electrons, which
can be seen as a simplified version of real aromatic molecules. In particular,
the ring with six sites and six electrons is our prototype of the benzene
molecule. It is already known that the Hubbard model itself cannot account for
the anisotropy of the diamagnetic susceptibility of the aromatic molecules,
which is observed when they are subjected to an external magnetic field
perpendicular to their basal plane. Therefore, we propose an extension of the
Hubbard model, with an ad hoc extra interaction term, with two adjustable
parameters. Our results show that this extension of the Hubbard model is able
to amplify the persistent currents established in the ground state of our rings
and, moreover, promotes an enhancement of the magnetic susceptibility
anisotropy depending on the tuning of the adjustable parameters. In particular,
for the prototype of the benzene molecule, we recover the order of magnitude of
the diamagnetic anisotropy measured for this molecule.

other genomic loci of interest, we are often faced with a situation in which
the number of allelic states greatly exceeds the population size. In this
limit, the population eventually adopts a steady state characterized by
mutation-selection-drift balance. Although new alleles continue to be explored
through mutation, the statistics of the population, and in particular the
probabilities of seeing specific allelic configurations in samples taken from a
population, do not change with time. In the absence of selection, probabilities
of allelic configurations are given by the Ewens sampling formula, widely used
in population genetics to detect deviations from neutrality. Here we develop an
extension of this formula to arbitrary, possibly epistatic, fitness landscapes.
Although our approach is general, we focus on the class of landscapes in which
alleles are grouped into two, three, or several fitness states. This class of
landscapes yields sampling probabilities that are computationally more
tractable, and can form a basis for the inference of selection signatures from
sequence data. We demonstrate that, for a sizeable range of mutation rates and
selection coefficients, the steady-state allelic diversity is not neutral.
Therefore, it may be used to infer selection coefficients, as well as other key
evolutionary parameters, using high-throughput sequencing of evolving
populations to collect data on locus polymorphisms. We also find that our
theory remains sufficiently accurate even if the assumptions such as the
infinite allele limit and the ""full connectivity"" assumption in which each
allele can mutate into any other allele are relaxed. Thus, our framework
establishes a theoretical foundation for inferring selection signatures from
samples of sequences produced by evolution on epistatic fitness landscapes.

the charge measurement is forced to yield the desired outcome (e.g. charge 0)

process with a certain success probability for each trial. In practice, the
number of measurements needed will vary from run to run. We show that such an

the braiding operation using a fixed number of three measurements supplemented

microresonators, enabling ultrashort optical pulses at microwave repetition

associated with changes in the intracavity power, that can lead to large
thermal resonance shifts during the excitation process and render the soliton
states in most commonly used resonator platforms short lived. Here we describe
a ""power kicking"" method to overcome this instability by modulating the power
of the pump laser. A fast modulation triggers the soliton formation, while a
slow adjustment of the power compensates the thermal effect during the
excitation laser scan. With this method also initially very short-lived (100ns)
soliton states , as encountered in SiN integrated photonic microresonators, can
be brought into a steady state in contrast to techniques reported earlier which
relied on an adjustment of the laser scan speed only. Once the soliton state is

unique positive probability measure $\mu$ on $\mathcal{B}$ such that $\mu (
\bigcap_{k=1}^n \theta_k r_{i_k} ) = 2^{-n}$ for all finite collections of
distinct indices $i_1, \ldots, i_n \in I$ and all collections of signs
$\theta_1, \ldots, \theta_n \in \{-1,1\}$, where the product $\theta x$ of a
sign $\theta$ by an element $x \in \mathcal{B}$ is defined by setting $1 x = x$
and $-1 x = - x = \mathbf{1} \setminus x$. Such a family we call a complete
Rademacher family. We prove that Dedekind $\sigma$-complete Boolean algebras
admitting complete Rademacher systems of the same cardinality are isomorphic.
As a consequence, we obtain that a Dedekind $\sigma$-complete Boolean algebra
is homogeneous measurable if and only if it admits a complete Rademacher
family. This new way to define a measure on a Boolean algebra allows us to
define classical systems on an arbitrary Riesz space, such as Rademacher and
Haar. We define a complete Rademacher system of any cardinality and a countable
complete Haar system on an element $e > 0$ of a vector lattice $E$ in such a
way that if $e$ is an order unit of $E$ then the corresponding systems become
complete for the entire $E$. We prove that if $E$ is Dedekind complete then any
complete Haar system on $e$ is an order Schauder basis for the ideal $A_e$
generated by $e$. Finally, we develop a theory of integration in a Riesz space
of elements of the band $B_e$ generated by a fixed $e > 0$ with respect to the
measure on the Boolean algebra $\mathfrak{F}_e$ of fragments of $e$ generated
by a complete Rademacher family on $\mathfrak{F}_e$. Much space is devoted to
examples showing that our way of thinking is sharp (e.g., we show the
essentiality of each of the condition in the definition of a Rademacher
family).

we introduced temporary constraints between near-colliding links. The resulting
constraint varieties instantaneously redirect the search for collision-free
conformations, and couple motions between distant parts of the linkage. Second,
we adapted a randomized Poisson-disk motion planner, which prevents local
oversampling and widens the search, to ultra-high dimensions. We evaluated our

vary the separation of the NV centers from the ferromagnet (FM), 2) record the
NV center longitudinal relaxation time $T_1$ during FMR, and 3) vary the
material properties of the FM. Based on the results, we propose the following
mechanism for ODFMR. Decay and scattering of the driven, uniform FMR mode
results in spinwaves that produce fluctuating dipolar fields in a spectrum of
frequencies. When the spinwave spectrum overlaps the NV center ground-state
spin resonance frequencies, the dipolar fields from these resonant spinwaves
relax the NV center spins, resulting in an ODFMR signal. These results lay the
foundation for an approach to NV center spin relaxometry to study FM dynamics
without the constraint of directly matching the NV center spin-transition
frequency to the magnetic system of interest, thus enabling an alternate
modality for scanned-probe magnetic microscopy that can sense ferromagnetic
resonance with nanoscale resolution.

pulsar braking by combined between the magnetic dipole emission and the

conventional neutron star and low mass quark star candidates, the inferred
ellipticities derived by the observed braking index are obviously much larger

the radio-quiet nature of this source, we employ the vacuum gap model developed
by Ruderman and Sutherland to constrain the inclination angle to be
$87.2-90^{\circ}$. Based on this, we propose that a low-mass neutron star with

Interface (HMI) and the Programmable Logic Controller (PLC) is known to be
highly periodic. However, it is sometimes multiplexed, due to asynchronous
scheduling. Modeling the network traffic patterns of multiplexed ICS streams
using Deterministic Finite Automata (DFA) for anomaly detection typically
produces a very large DFA, and a high false-alarm rate. We introduce a new
modeling approach that addresses this gap. Our Statechart DFA modeling includes
multiple DFAs, one per cyclic pattern, together with a DFA-selector that
de-multiplexes the incoming traffic into sub-channels and sends them to their
respective DFAs. We demonstrate how to automatically construct the Statechart
from a captured traffic stream. Our unsupervised learning algorithm builds a
Discrete-Time Markov Chain (DTMC) from the stream. Next it splits the symbols
into sets, one per multiplexed cycle, based on symbol frequencies and node
degrees in the DTMC graph. Then it creates a sub-graph for each cycle, and
extracts Euler cycles for each sub-graph. The final Statechart is comprised of
one DFA per Euler cycle. The algorithms allow for non-unique symbols, that
appear in more than one cycle, and also for symbols that appear more than once
in a cycle. We evaluated our solution on traces from a production ICS using the
Siemens S7-0x72 protocol. We also stress-tested our algorithms on a collection
of synthetically-generated traces that simulated multiplexed ICS traces with
varying levels of symbol uniqueness and time overlap. The algorithms were able
to split the symbols into sets with 99.6% accuracy. The resulting Statechart
modeled the traces with a low median false-alarm rate of 0.483%. In all but the
most extreme scenarios the Statechart model drastically reduced both the
false-alarm rate and the learned model size in compare to a naive single-DFA

Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiple Access-based (OFDMA-based) scheduler.
Similar to the impact of the Channel Quality Indicator (CQI) on the scheduler
in the Long Term Evolution (LTE), ML is utilized to provide the scheduler with
pertinent information about the User Equipment (UE) traffic patterns, demands,
Quality of Service (QoS) requirements, instantaneous user throughput and other
network conditions. An adaptive ML-based framework is proposed in order to
optimize the LTE scheduler operation. The proposed technique targets multiple
objective scheduling strategies. The weights of the different objectives are
adjusted to optimize the resources allocation per transmission based on the UEs
demand pattern. In addition, it overcomes the trade-off problem of the
traditional scheduling methods. The technique can be used as a generic
framework with any scheduling strategy. In this paper, Genetic Algorithm-based
(GA-based) multi- objective scheduler is considered to illustrate the
efficiency of the proposed adaptive scheduling solution. Results show that
using the combination of clustering and classification algorithms along with
the GA optimizes the GA scheduler functionality and makes use of the ML process

compression schemes that represent an unweighted graph metric in small space,
say $\tilde{O}(n^{1+\delta})$ bits. There is an inherent tradeoff between the
sparsity parameter $\delta$ and the stretch function $f$ of the compression
scheme, but the qualitative nature of this tradeoff has remained a persistent
open problem.
  In this paper we show that the recent additive spanner lower bound of Abboud
and Bodwin is just the first step in a hierarchy of lower bounds that fully
characterize the asymptotic behavior of the optimal stretch function $f$ as a
function of $\delta \in (0,1/3)$. Specifically, for any integer $k\ge 2$, any
compression scheme with size $O(n^{1+\frac{1}{2^k-1} - \epsilon})$ has a
sublinear additive stretch function $f$: $$f(d) = d +
\Omega(d^{1-\frac{1}{k}}).$$ This lower bound matches Thorup and Zwick's (2006)
construction of sublinear additive emulators. It also shows that Elkin and
Peleg's $(1+\epsilon,\beta)$-spanners have an essentially optimal tradeoff
between $\delta,\epsilon,$ and $\beta$, and that the sublinear additive
spanners of Pettie (2009) and Chechik (2013) are not too far from optimal.
  To complement these lower bounds we present a new construction of
$(1+\epsilon, O(k/\epsilon)^{k-1})$-spanners with size $O((k/\epsilon)^{h_k}
kn^{1+\frac{1}{2^{k+1}-1}})$, where $h_k < 3/4$. This size bound improves on
the spanners of Elkin and Peleg (2004), Thorup and Zwick (2006), and Pettie
(2009). According to our lower bounds neither the size nor stretch function can
be substantially improved.

variability of VT stems from unclean interfaces, trapped charges in the
underlying substrate, and sulfur vacancies created during the mechanical
exfoliation process. In this study, we demonstrate a simple and reliable oxygen
plasma treatment, which mitigates the effects of unintentional doping created
by surface defect cites, such as S vacancies, and surface contamination. This
plasma treatment restores charge neutrality to the MoS2 and shifts the
threshold turn-on voltage towards 0V. Out of the 8 devices measured, all
exhibit a shift of the FET turn-on voltage from an average of -18.7V to -0.9V.
The oxygen plasma treatment passivates these defects, which reduces surface
scattering, causing increased mobility and improved subthreshold swing. For
as-prepared devices with low mobilities (~0.01cm2/V.s), we observe up to a
190-fold increase in mobility after exposure to the oxygen plasma. Perhaps the
most important aspect of this oxygen plasma treatment is that it reduces the
device-to-device variability, which is a crucial factor in realizing any
practical application of these devices.

scenario where a substantial fraction of the network loses its functionality.
These cascading failure scenarios often take place in networks which are

cascading failure in random geometric networks, we introduce and analyze a
continuous cascading failure model where a node has an initial
continuously-valued state, and fails if the aggregate state of its neighbors
fall below a threshold. Within this model, we derive analytical conditions for
the occurrence and non-occurrence of cascading node failure, respectively.

dimensionality reduction, a structured approach to reducing large phylogenetic
trees to a distribution of smaller trees. We prove a stability theorem ensuring
that small perturbations of the large trees are taken to small perturbations of
the resulting distributions.
  We then present a series of four biologically motivated applications to the
analysis of genomic data, spanning cancer and infectious disease. The first
quantifies how chemotherapy can disrupt the evolution of common leukemias. The
second examines a link between geometric information and the histologic grade
in relapsed gliomas, where longer relapse branches were specific to high grade

A practical example of this would be a query for the k most relevant web-pages

Relevance and dissimilarity are quantified using an aggregation of network
distance and context similarity. For example, for a specific configuration of
the problem, we might be interested in web-pages that are similar with the
query in terms of their textual description but distant from each other in
terms of the web-graph, e.g. many clicks away. In retrospect, a dearth of work
can be found in the literature addressing this problem taking the network
structure formed by the document links into consideration.
  In this work, we propose a hill-climbing approach that is seeded with a
document collection which is generated using greedy heuristics to diversify
initially. More importantly, we tackle the problem in the context of web-pages
where there is an underlying network structure connecting the available
documents and resources. This is a significant difference to the majority of
works that tackle the problem in terms of either content definitions, or the
graph structure of the data, but never addressing both aspects simultaneously.

to combine both aspects of this important problem in an elegant fashion by also
allowing a great degree of flexibility on how to configure the trade-offs of
(i) document relevance over result-items' dissimilarity, and (ii) network
distance over content relevance or dissimilarity. Last but not least, we

of a given region, as is relevant for the replica construction. We map this
contour into the bulk gravitational theory, and argue that the saddle point
solutions of these replica geometries lead to a consistent prescription for
computing the field theory Renyi entropies. In the limiting case where the
replica index is taken to unity, a local analysis suffices to show that these

resonance, i.e., the orbital Feshbach resonance (OFR), has been proposed and
experimentally observed in ultracold $^{173}$Yb atoms. When the OFR of the
$^{173}$Yb atoms occurs, the energy gap between the open and closed channels is
smaller by two orders of magnitudes than the van der Waals energy. As a result,
quantitative accurate results for the low-energy two-body problems can be
obtained via multi-channel quantum defect theory (MQDT), which is based on the
exact solution of the Schr$\ddot{{\rm o}}$dinger equation with the van der
Waals potential. In this paper we use the MQDT to calculate the two-atom
scattering length, effective range, and the binding energy of two-body bound
states for the systems with OFR. With these results we further study the
clock-transition spectrum for the two-body bound states, which can be used to
experimentally measure the binding energy. Our results are helpful for the
quantitative theoretical and experimental researches for the ultracold gases of
alkali-earth (like) atoms with OFR.

testing. The approach is based on a constrained matrix factorization that
leverages the relationship between term frequency and a given response variable
in addition to co-occurrences between terms to recover topics that are both
predictive of consumer sentiment and useful for understanding the underlying
textual themes. The factorization is combined with ordinal regression to
provide guidance from online reviews on a single app's performance as well as
systematically compare different apps over time for benchmarking of features

computing the equality function in the simultaneous message passing (SMP)

demonstrate a quantum advantage in terms of information leakage for practical
quantum protocols. We prove our bound by obtaining an improved finite size
version of the communication bound due to Babai and Kimmel, relating randomized
communication to deterministic communication in the SMP model. We then relate
information leakage to randomized communication through a series of reductions.
We first provide alternative characterizations for information leakage,
allowing us to link it to average length communication while allowing for
shared randomness (pairwise, with the referee). A Markov inequality links this
with bounded length communication, and a Newman type argument allows us to go
from shared to private randomness. The only reduction in which we incur more
than a logarithmic additive factor is in the Markov inequality; in particular,
our compression method is essentially tight for the SMP model with average
length communication.

polarized electrons off longitudinally polarized protons using the CEBAF Large
Acceptance Spectrometer at Jefferson Lab. The kinematic range covered is
$1.1<W<3$ GeV and $1<Q^2<6$ GeV$^2$. Results were obtained for about 6000 bins
in $W$, $Q^2$, $\cos(\theta^*)$, and $\phi^*$. Except at forward angles, very
large target-spin asymmetries are observed over the entire $W$ region.
Reasonable agreement is found with phenomenological fits to previous data for
$W<1.6$ GeV, but very large differences are seen at higher values of $W$. A
GPD-based model is in poor agreement with the data. When combined with cross
section measurements, the present results provide powerful constraints on
nucleon resonance amplitudes at moderate and large values of $Q^2$, for
resonances with masses as high as 2.4 GeV.

measured confounders. Survey data are often collected under complex sampling
designs such as multistage cluster sampling, which presents challenges for
propensity score modeling and estimation. In addition, for clustered data,
there may also be unobserved cluster effects related to both the treatment and
the outcome. When such unmeasured confounders exist and are omitted in the
propensity score model, the subsequent propensity score adjustment will be
biased. We propose a calibrated propensity score weighting adjustment for
multi-stage clustered data in the presence of unmeasured cluster-level
confounders. The propensity score is calibrated to balance design-weighted
covariate distributions and cluster effects between treatment groups. In
particular, we consider a growing number of calibration constraints increasing
with the number of clusters, which is necessary for removing asymptotic bias
that is associated with the unobserved cluster-level confounders. We show that
our estimator is robust in the sense that the estimator is consistent without
correct specification of the propensity score model. We extend the results to
the multiple treatments case. In simulation studies we show that the proposed
estimator is superior to other competitors. We estimate the effect of School

spontaneous defect generation in continuous phase transitions (CPTs) can be
understood by the critical slowing down. In most CPTs of atomic Bose-Einstein
condensates (BECs), the universality of spontaneous defect generations has been
explained by the divergent relaxation time associated with the nontrivial
gapless Bogoliubov excitations. However, for atomic BECs in synthetic gauge
fields, their spontaneous superfluidity breakdown is resulted from the
divergent correlation length associated with the zero Landau critical velocity.
Here, by considering an atomic BEC ladder subjected to a synthetic magnetic
field, we reveal that the spontaneous superfluidity breakdown obeys the KZM.
The Kibble-Zurek scalings are derived from the Landau critical velocity which
determines the correlation length. In further, the critical exponents are
numerically extracted from the critical spatial-temporal dynamics of the
bifurcation delay and the spontaneous vortex generation. Our study provides a
general way to explore and understand the spontaneous superfluidity breakdown
in CPTs from a single-well dispersion to a double-well one, such as, BECs in
synthetic gauge fields, spin-orbit coupled BECs, and BECs in shaken optical
lattices.

random noises. For symmetric noises, however, k-nearest neighbor achieves the
same consistent rate as that of noise-free setting, which verifies the
resistance of k-nearest neighbor to random noisy labels. Motivated by the
theoretical analysis, we propose the Robust k-Nearest Neighbor (RkNN) approach
to deal with noisy labels. The basic idea is to make unilateral corrections to
examples, whose labels are totally misled by random noises, and classify the
others directly by utilizing the robustness of k-nearest neighbor. We verify
the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm both theoretically and empirically.

violent solar eruptions, namely flares and coronal mass ejections (CMEs). The
largest AR in the past 24 years, NOAA AR 12192, crossed the visible disk from
2014 October 17 to 30, unusually produced more than one hundred flares,
including 32 M-class and 6 X-class ones, but only one small CME. Flares and
CMEs are believed to be two phenomena in the same eruptive process. Why is such
a flare-rich AR so CME-poor? We compared this AR with other four ARs; two were
productive in both and two were inert. The investigation of the photospheric
parameters based on the SDO/HMI vector magnetogram reveals that the flare-rich
AR 12192, as the other two productive ARs, has larger magnetic flux, current
and free magnetic energy than the two inert ARs, but contrast to the two
productive ARs, it has no strong, concentrated current helicity along both
sides of the flaring neutral line, indicating the absence of a mature magnetic
structure consisting of highly sheared or twisted field lines. Furthermore, the
decay index above the AR 12192 is relatively low, showing strong constraint.
These results suggest that productive ARs are always large and have enough
current and free energy to power flares, but whether or not a flare is
accompanied by a CME is seemingly related to (1) if there is mature sheared or
twisted core field serving as the seed of the CME, (2) if the constraint of the
overlying arcades is weak enough.

years as exemplified in anomalous Hall effect due to a Berry phase in momentum

originating from the real-space Berry phase, has recently become of great
importance in the context of magnetic skyrmions. We have observed topological
Hall effect in bilayers consisting of ferromagnetic SrRuO$_3$ and paramagnetic
SrIrO$_3$ over a wide region of both temperature and magnetic field. The
topological term rapidly decreases with the thickness of SrRuO$_3$, ending up
with the complete disappearance at 7 unit cells of SrRuO$_3$. Combined with
model calculation, we concluded that the topological Hall effect is driven by
interface Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction, which is caused by both the broken
inversion symmetry and the strong spin-orbit coupling of SrIrO$_3$. Such
interaction is expected to realize the N\'{e}el-type magnetic skyrmion, of
which size is estimated to be $\sim$10 nm from the magnitude of topological
Hall resistivity. The results established that the high-quality oxide interface

due to inter-cell interference. We demonstrate that, by utilizing the fact that
different paths in time are associated with different angles of arrival (AoA),
the pilot contamination can be significantly reduced through aligning the PDPs
of the users served by different BSs appropriately. Computer simulations
further convince us PDP aligning can serve as the new baseline design

provide measurements of transit times and a transit timing variation (TTV)

eccentricity to a reasonable range, we infer masses for the outer four planets

The similar masses but different radii are consistent with terrestrial

that the outer four planets are in a rare dynamical configuration with four
interconnected three-body resonances that are librating with few degree

  Antenna Systems","submitted to IEEE Transactions on Information Theory",,,,"cs.IT math.IT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In this paper, an uplink scheduling policy problem to minimize the network
latency, defined as the air-time to serve all of users with a
quality-of-service (QoS), under an energy constraint is considered in a
training-based large-scale antenna systems (LSAS) employing a simple linear
receiver. An optimal algorithm providing the exact latency-optimal uplink
scheduling policy is proposed with a polynomial-time complexity. Via numerical
simulations, it is shown that the proposed scheduling policy can provide
several times lower network latency over the conventional ones in realistic
environments. In addition, the proposed scheduling policy and its network
latency are analyzed asymptotically to provide better insights on the system
behavior. Four operating regimes are classified according to the average
received signal quality, $\rho$, and the number of BS antennas, $M$. It turns
out that orthogonal pilots are optimal only in the regime $\rho\gg1$ and $ M\ll
\log^2\rho$. In other regimes ($\rho\ll 1$ or $ M\gg \log^2\rho$), it turns out
that non-orthogonal pilots become optimal. More rigorously, the use of
non-orthogonal pilots can reduce the network latency by a factor of $\Theta(M)$
when $\rho\ll 1$ or by a factor of $\Theta(\sqrt{M}/\log M)$ when $\rho\gg 1$
and $M\gg \log\rho$, which would be a critical guideline for designing 5G

estimation quality at the base station (BS) in a massive multi-input
multi-output (MIMO) system. Thus, it is critical to explore all possible
avenues to enable more orthogonal resources for the users to transmit
non-interfering UL pilots. In conventional designs, pilot orthogonality
typically assumes constant channel gains over time, which limits the amount of
orthogonal resources in the case of time-selective channels. To circumvent this
constraint, in this paper, we show how to enable orthogonal multiplexing of
pilots in the case of Doppler fading by aligning the power spectrum densities
(PSD) of different users. From the derived PSD aligning rules, we can see
multiple users can be sounded simultaneously without creating/suffering pilot
contamination even when these users are experiencing time-varying channels.
Furthermore, we provide analytical formulas characterizing the channel
estimation mean square error (MSE) performance. Computer simulations further
confirm us the PSD alignment can serve as one important decontamination
mechanism for the UL pilots in massive MIMO.

sub-problems on disjoint connected parts of a network. Unfortunately, the
diameter of these parts can be significantly larger than the diameter of the
underlying network, leading to slow running times. Recent work by [Ghaffari and
Hauepler; SODA'16] showed that this phenomenon can be seen as the broad
underlying reason for the pervasive $\Omega(\sqrt{n} + D)$ lower bounds that
apply to most optimization problems in the CONGEST model. On the positive side,
this work also introduced low-congestion shortcuts as an elegant solution to
circumvent this problem in certain topologies of interest. Particularly, they
showed that there exist good shortcuts for any planar network and more
generally any bounded genus network. This directly leads to fast $O(D
\log^{O(1)} n)$ distributed algorithms for MST and Min-Cut approximation, given
that one can efficiently construct these shortcuts in a distributed manner.
  Unfortunately, the shortcut construction of [Ghaffari and Hauepler; SODA'16]
relies heavily on having access to a genus embedding of the network. Computing
such an embedding distributedly, however, is a hard problem - even for planar
networks. No distributed embedding algorithm for bounded genus graphs is in
sight.
  In this work, we side-step this problem by defining a restricted and more
structured form of shortcuts and giving a novel construction algorithm which
efficiently finds a shortcut which is, up to a logarithmic factor, as good as
the best shortcut that exists for a given network. This new construction
algorithm directly leads to an $O(D \log^{O(1)} n)$-round algorithm for solving
optimization problems like MST for any topology for which good restricted
shortcuts exist - without the need to compute any embedding. This includes the
first efficient algorithm for bounded genus graphs.

away from the weak-lensing mass center toward the opposite direction of the

and entropy distributions around the subhalo. Excluding the X-ray tail, the
temperature beyond the truncation radius is 8-10$~\rm keV$, which is two times
higher than that of the subhalo and the X-ray tail. The pressure is nearly
uniform excluding southern part of the subhalo at two times of the truncation
radius. We computed the gas mass within the truncation radius and the X-ray
tail. While the gas fraction within the truncation radius is about 5 times
smaller than that of regular groups, the gas mass in the subhalo and the X-ray
tail to weak-lensing mass ratio is consistent with that of regular groups.
Assuming the infall velocity, $2000~\rm km~s^{-1}$, the ram pressure is 1.4
times greater than gravitational force per unit area. Assuming the
Kelvin-Helmholtz instabilities, the total lost mass is approximately
$3\times10^{11}~M_{\odot}$. If this gas had originally been within the
truncation radius, the gas mass fraction of the subhalo would have been
comparable with those of regular groups before infalling to the Coma cluster.

extract electronic and nuclear dynamics from molecular targets with attosecond
temporal resolution. However, since an {\em ab-initio} treatment of even the
simplest diatomic systems is beyond today's capabilities approximate
qualitative descriptions are warranted. In this paper, we develop such a
theoretical approach to model the photoelectrons resulting from intense
laser-molecule interaction. We present a general theory for symmetric diatomic
molecules in the single active electron approximation that, amongst other
capabilities, allows adjusting both the internuclear separation and molecular
potential in a direct and simple way. More importantly we derive an analytic
approximate solution of the time dependent Schr\""odinger equation (TDSE), based
on a generalized strong field approximation (SFA) version. Using that approach
we obtain expressions for electrons emitted transition amplitudes from two
different molecular centres, and accelerated then in the strong laser field.
One innovative aspect of our theory is the fact that the dipole matrix elements
are free from non-physical gauge and coordinate system dependent terms -- this
is achieved by adapting the coordinate system, in which SFA is performed, to
the centre from which the corresponding part of the time dependent wave
function originates. Our analytic results agree very well with the numerical
solution of the full three-dimensional TDSE for the H$_2^+$ molecule. Moreover,
the theoretical model was applied to describe laser-induced electron
diffraction (LIED) measurements of O$_2^+$ molecules, obtained at ICFO, and
reproduces the main features of the experiment very well. Our approach can be
extended in a natural way to more complex molecules and multi-electron systems.

using fully-relativistic first-principles calculations based on
density-functional theory, we show that a substantial spin spliting bands
observed in the CBM is effectively controlled and tuned by applying the biaxial
strain. We also find that these spin splitting bands induce spin textures
exhibiting fully out-of-plane spin polarization in the opposite direction
between the K and Q points and their time reversals in the first Brillouin
zone. Our study clarify that the strain plays an significant role in the
spin-orbit coupling of the WS2 ML, which has very important implications in
designing future spintronics devices.

are useful for medical image tissue segmentation or as post-hoc models for

Linear Modeling framework (GLM), used in this case to separate stochastic
(Gaussian) noise from some kind of positive or negative ""activation"" (modeled
as Gamma or inverse-Gamma distributed). To date, the most common choice in this
context it is Gaussian/Gamma mixture models learned through a maximum
likelihood (ML) approach; we recently extended such algorithm for mixture
models with inverse-Gamma components. Here, we introduce a fully analytical
Variational Bayes (VB) learning framework for both Gamma and/or inverse-Gamma
components. We use synthetic and resting state fMRI data to compare the
performance of the ML and VB algorithms in terms of area under the curve and
computational cost. We observed that the ML Gaussian/Gamma model is very
expensive specially when considering high resolution images; furthermore, these
solutions are highly variable and they occasionally can overestimate the
activations severely. The Bayesian Gauss-Gamma is in general the fastest
algorithm but provides too dense solutions. The maximum likelihood
Gaussian/inverse-Gamma is also very fast but provides in general very sparse
solutions. The variational Gaussian/inverse-Gamma mixture model is the most
robust and its cost is acceptable even for high resolution images. Further, the
presented methodology represents an essential building block that can be
directly used in more complex inference tasks, specially designed to analyse
MRI-fMRI data; such models include for example analytical variational mixture
models with adaptive spatial regularization or better source models for new
spatial blind source separation approaches.

transport are based on quasilinear theory. Nonlinear poloidal momentum flux -
$\langle \tilde{v}_r \tilde{n} \tilde{v}_{\theta} \rangle$ is universally
neglected. However, in the strong turbulence regime where relative fluctuation
amplitude is no longer small, quasilinear theory is invalid. This is true at
the all-important plasma edge. In this work, nonlinear poloidal momentum flux $
\langle \tilde{v}_r \tilde{n} \tilde{v}_{\theta} \rangle $ in strong
electrostatic turbulence is calculated using Hasegawa-Mima equation, and is
compared with quasilinear poloidal Reynolds stress. A novel property is that
symmetry breaking in fluctuation spectrum is not necessary for a nonlinear
poloidal momentum flux. This is fundamentally different from the quasilinear
Reynold stress. Furthermore, the comparison implies that the poloidal rotation
drive from the radial gradient of nonlinear momentum flux is comparable to that
from the quasilinear Reynolds force. Nonlinear poloidal momentum transport in
strong electrostatic turbulence is thus not negligible for poloidal rotation
drive, and so may be significant to transport barrier formation.

with enhanced physical properties. The state-of-the-art techniques for
synthesizing these particles provide control over shape, size, and
directionality of the interactions. In spite of these advances, there is still
a huge gap between the synthesis of individual components and the management of
their spontaneous organization towards the desired structures. The main
challenge is the control over the dynamics of self-organization. In their
kinetic route towards thermodynamically stable structures, colloidal particles
self-organize into intermediate (mesoscopic) structures that are much larger
than the individual particles and become the relevant units for the dynamics.
To follow the dynamics and identify kinetically trapped structures, one needs
to develop new theoretical and numerical tools. Here we discuss the
self-organization of functionalized colloids (also known as patchy colloids) on
attractive substrates. We review our recent results on the adsorption and
relaxation and explore the use of annealing cycles to overcome kinetic barriers
and drive the relaxation towards the targeted structures.

analytically tractable. The second step is fitting the parameters of each peak
function to the given spectrum by calculating the posterior density, which has
a problem of local minima and saddles since multipeak models are nonlinear and
hierarchical. Our framework enables the escape from local minima or saddles by
using the exchange Monte Carlo method and calculates Bayes free energy via the
multiple histogram method. We discuss a simulation demonstrating how efficient
our framework is and show that estimating both the noise variance and the

Carlo methods. In this method, we make use of a connected Markov chain over the
given conditional sample space to estimate the P-values numerically for various
conditional tests. A Markov basis plays an importance role in this arguments,
because it guarantees the connectivity of the chain, which is needed for
unbiasedness of the estimate, for arbitrary conditional sample space. As
another important point, a Markov basis is characterized as generators of the
well-specified toric ideals of polynomial rings. This connection between
commutative algebra and statistics is the main result of Diaconis and Sturmfels
(1998). After this first paper, a Markov basis is studied intensively by many
researchers both in commutative algebra and statistics, which yields an
attractive field called computational algebraic statistics. In this paper, we
give a review of the Markov chain Monte Carlo methods for contingency tables

modifying the function to be minimized in the NMF formulation by enforcing the
reconstruction of the unknown ratings toward a prior term. We then combine
different methods obtaining two mixed strategies which turn out to be very
effective in the reconstruction of missing observations. We perform a
thoughtful comparison of different methods on the basis of several evaluation

showing that the algorithm obtaining the best score for a given measure is in
general the best also when different measures are considered, lowering the
interest in designing specific evaluation measures. The algorithms have been

in patients with underlying valvular disease, its hemodynamic contributions are
not fully understood. The present work aimed to computationally study how
physical conditions imposed by pathologic valvular anatomy act on AF
hemodynamics. We simulated AF with different severity grades of left-sided
valvular diseases and compared the cardiovascular effects that they exert
during AF, compared to lone AF. The fluid dynamics model used here has been
recently validated for lone AF and relies on a lumped parameterization of the
four heart chambers, together with the systemic and pulmonary circulation.
Three different grades of severity (mild, moderate, severe) were analyzed for
each of the four valvulopathies (aortic stenosis, mitral stenosis, aortic
regurgitation, mitral regurgitation). Regurgitation was hemodynamically more
relevant than stenosis, as the latter led to inefficient cardiac flow, while
the former introduced more drastic fluid dynamics variation. Moreover, mitral
valvulopathies were more significant than aortic ones. In case of aortic valve
diseases, proper mitral functioning damps out changes at atrial and pulmonary
levels. In the case of mitral valvulopathy, the mitral valve lost its
regulating capability, thus hemodynamic variations almost equally affected
regions upstream and downstream of the valve. The present study revealed that
both mitral and aortic regurgitation strongly affect hemodynamics, followed by
mitral stenosis, while aortic stenosis has the least impact among the analyzed
valvular diseases. The proposed approach can provide new mechanistic insights
as to which valvular pathologies merit more aggressive treatment of AF. Present
findings, if clinically confirmed, hold the potential to impact AF management
(e.g., adoption of a rhythm control strategy) in specific valvular diseases.

variables in globular clusters. Emphasis was given on their properties and the
observational selection effects when observing and detecting them. In this work
we analysed in this work six models, including three with Kroupa distributions
of the initial binaries. We found that for models with Kroupa initial
distributions, considering the standard value of the efficiency of the common
envelope phase adopted in BSE, no single cataclysmic variable was formed only
via binary stellar evolution, i. e., in order to form them, strong dynamical
interactions have to take place. We show and explain why this is inconsistent
with observational and theoretical results. Our results indicate that the
population of cataclysmic variables in globular clusters is, mainly, in the
last stage of their evolution and observational selection effects can
drastically change the expected number of observed cataclysmic variables. We
show that the probability of observing them during the outbursts is extremely
small and conclude that the best way of looking for cataclysmic variables in
globular clusters is by searching for variabilities during quiescence, instead
of during outbursts. For that, one would need a very deep observation which
could reach magnitudes $\gtrsim$ 27 mag. Finally, we argue that cataclysmic
variables in globular clusters are not necessarily magnetic.

spectral span of a single gap mode in the nanotube-film cavity with a 3-nm wide

an anti-crossing behavior in the spectral response, but also splits the single
spatial mode into two distinct modes that are easily identified by their
far-field scattering profiles. Simulation results confirm the experimental
findings and the sensitivity of the plexcitonic coupling is explored using
digital control of the gap spacing. Our work opens up a new perspective to

attosecond science. On one hand, it allows to investigate fundamental processes
of the non-linear response of electrons driven by a strong laser pulse in a
periodic crystal lattice. On the other hand, it opens new paths toward
efficient attosecond pulse generation, novel imaging of electronic wave
functions, and enhancement of high-order harmonic generation (HHG) intensity. A
key feature of HHG in a solid (as compared to the well-understood phenomena of
HHG in an atomic gas) is the delocalization of the process, whereby an electron
ionized from one site in the periodic lattice may recombine with any other.
Here, we develop an analytic model, based on the localized Wannier wave
functions in the valence band and delocalized Bloch functions in the conduction
band. This Wannier-Bloch approach assesses the contributions of individual
lattice sites to the HHG process, and hence addresses precisely the question of
localization of harmonic emission in solids. We apply this model to investigate
HHG in a ZnO crystal for two different orientations, corresponding to wider and
narrower valence and conduction bands, respectively. Interestingly, for
narrower bands, the HHG process shows significant localization, similar to
harmonic generation in atoms. For all cases, the delocalized contributions to
HHG emission are highest near the band-gap energy. Our results pave the way to
controlling localized contributions to HHG in a solid crystal, with hard to
overestimate implications for the emerging area of atto-nanoscience.

Despite an apparent pile-up of source numbers at radii associated with spiral

the arms do not affect the star-forming productivity of dense clumps either via
physical triggering processes or through the statistical effects of larger
source samples associated with the arms. Within this range of Galactocentric
radii, we find that the SFF declines with R_GC at a rate of -0.026 +/- 0.002
per kiloparsec, despite the dense gas mass fraction having been observed to be
constant in the inner Galaxy. This suggests that the SFF may be weakly

dependent region of optimal signal estimation for our foreground and EoR
models, within which the spatial power in the EoR signal relative to
foregrounds is maximised. We identify a target field dependent region, in
k-space, of intrinsic foreground power spectral contamination at low k_perp and
k_parallel and a transition to a relatively foreground-free intrinsic EoR
window in the complement to this region. The contaminated region of k-space
demonstrates that simultaneous estimation of the EoR and foregrounds is
important for obtaining statistically robust estimates of the EoR power
spectrum; biased results will be obtained from methodologies that ignore their
covariance. Using simulated observations with frequency dependent uv-coverage
and primary beam, with the former derived for HERA in 37-antenna and
331-antenna configuration, we recover instrumental power spectra consistent
with their intrinsic counterparts. We discuss the implications of these results
for optimal strategies for unbiased estimation of the EoR power spectrum.

association uncertainty and the use of ""augmented target states"" including
binary target indicators make it possible to exploit statistical independencies

the number of sensors, and linearly in the number of measurements per sensors.

class of left-right symmetric models where neutrino mass originates by natural
type-II seesaw dominance. The spontaneous symmetry breaking is implemented with
doublets, triplets and bidoublet scalars. The fermion sector is extended with
an extra sterile neutrino per generation that helps in implementing the seesaw
mechanism. The presence of extra particles in the model exactly cancels type-I
seesaw and allows large value for Dirac neutrino mass matrix $M_D$. The key
feature of this work is that all the physical masses and mixing are expressed
in terms of neutrino oscillation parameters and lightest neutrino mass thereby
facilitating to constrain light neutrino masses from $0\nu\beta\beta$ decay.
With this large value of $M_D$ new contributions arise due to; i) purely
left-handed current via exchange of heavy right-handed neutrinos as well as
sterile neutrinos, ii) the so called $\lambda$ and $\eta$ diagrams. New physics
contributions also arise from right-handed currents with right-handed gauge
boson $W_R$ mass around $3$~TeV. From the numerical study, we find that the new
contributions to $0\nu\beta\beta$ decay not only saturate the current
experimental bound but also give lower limit on absolute scale of lightest
neutrino mass and favor NH pattern of light neutrino mass hierarchy.

characterisation of all the forms of multipartite nonlocality has until now
been out of reach, mainly due to the complexity of generic multipartite causal
models. Here, we employ the formalism of Bayesian networks to reveal
connections among different causal structures that make a both practical and
physically meaningful classification possible. Our framework holds for
arbitrarily many parties. We apply it to study the tripartite scenario in
detail, where we fully characterize all the nonlocality classes. Remarkably, we
identify new highly nonlocal causal structures that cannot reproduce all
quantum correlations. This shows, to our knowledge, the strongest form of

processes and broadcasts information to the two users over another rate-limited

information from the relay. In the untrusted relay setting, the goal is to
establish key agreement between the two users at the highest key rate without
leaking information about the key to the relay. We characterize inner and outer
bounds to the optimal tradeoff between communication and key rates. The inner
bound is based on the scheme which involves a combination of binning, network
coding, and key aggregation techniques. For the trusted relay setting with a
public broadcast link, the optimal communication-key rate tradeoff is provided
for a special case where the two sources are available losslessly at the relay.
The results can be relevant for cloud-based secret key generation services.

decomposition of Simard et al. (2011) to study how the bulge and disc
components contribute to the parent galaxy's star formation activity, by
determining its position in the star formation rate (SFR) - stellar mass
(M$_{\star}$) plane at 0.02$<z<$0.1. We use the bulge and disc colours as proxy
for their SFRs. We study the mean galaxy bulge-total mass ratio (B/T) as a
function of the residual from the MS ($\Delta_{MS}$) and find that the
B/T-$\Delta_{MS}$ relation exhibits a parabola-like shape with the peak of the
MS corresponding to the lowest B/Ts at any stellar mass. The lower and upper
envelop of the MS are populated by galaxies with similar B/T, velocity
dispersion and concentration ($R_{90}/R_{50}$) values. Bulges above the MS are
characterised by blue colours or, when red, by a high level of dust
obscuration, thus indicating that in both cases they are actively star forming.
When on the MS or below it, bulges are mostly red and dead. At stellar masses
above $10^{10.5} $M$_{\odot}$, bulges on the MS or in the green valley tend to
be significantly redder than their counterparts in the quiescence region,
despite similar levels of dust obscuration. The disc color anti-correlates at
any mass with the distance from the MS, getting redder when approaching the MS
lower envelope and the quiescence region. We conclude that the position of a
galaxy in the LogSFR-LogM$_{\star}$ plane depends on the star formation
activity of its components: above the MS both bulge and disk are actively star
forming. The nuclear activity is the first to be suppressed, moving the
galaxies on the MS. Once the disk stops forming stars as well, the galaxy moves
below the MS and eventually to the quiescence region. This is confirmed by a
large fraction ($\sim45\%$) of passive galaxies with a secure two component
morphology.

all the tokens to their destinations, using the minimum number of swaps, i.e.,
operations of exchanging the tokens on two adjacent vertices. As the main
result of this paper, we show that Token Swapping is $W[1]$-hard parameterized
by the length $k$ of a shortest sequence of swaps. In fact, we prove that, for
any computable function $f$, it cannot be solved in time $f(k)n^{o(k / \log

Token Swapping (where the tokens have different colors and tokens of the same
color are indistinguishable), and Subset Token Swapping (where each token has a
set of possible destinations). To complement the hardness result, we prove that

ability to automatically learn feature representation from raw pixels,
eliminating the need for hand-designed procedures. However, recent methods for
single image super-resolution (SR) fail to maintain this advantage. They
utilize CNNs in two decoupled steps, i.e., first upsampling the low resolution
(LR) image to the high resolution (HR) size with hand-designed techniques
(e.g., bicubic interpolation), and then applying CNNs on the upsampled LR image
to reconstruct HR results. In this paper, we seek an alternative and propose a
new image SR method, which jointly learns the feature extraction, upsampling
and HR reconstruction modules, yielding a completely end-to-end trainable deep
CNN. As opposed to existing approaches, the proposed method conducts upsampling
in the latent feature space with filters that are optimized for the task of
image SR. In addition, the HR reconstruction is performed in a multi-scale
manner to simultaneously incorporate both short- and long-range contextual
information, ensuring more accurate restoration of HR images. To facilitate
network training, a new training approach is designed, which jointly trains the
proposed deep network with a relatively shallow network, leading to faster
convergence and more superior performance. The proposed method is extensively
evaluated on widely adopted data sets and improves the performance of
state-of-the-art methods with a considerable margin. Moreover, in-depth
ablation studies are conducted to verify the contribution of different network
designs to image SR, providing additional insights for future research.

CDW orders observed. This indicates that similar driving mechanisms for CDW
formation in the bulk, where anisotropic lattice strain energy is important,
are at play at the surface. In our bias-dependent measurements, we find no
contrast inversion for the CDW state between occupied and empty states. This
finding differs from other quasi 2-dimensional materials containing a hidden
1-dimensional character which leads to a favorable Fermi surface nesting
scenario. Our temperature-dependent measurements provide evidence for localized
CDW formation above the bulk transition temperature, T$_{cdw}$.

mass ejections (CMEs) launched successively from the Sun on 2013 October 25.
The estimated kinematics, from three-dimensional (3D) reconstruction techniques
applied to observations of CMEs by SECCHI/Coronagraphic (COR) and Heliospheric
Imagers (HIs), reveal their collision around 37 $R_\sun$ from the Sun. In the
analysis, we take into account the propagation and expansion speeds, impact
direction, angular size as well as the masses of the CMEs. These parameters are
derived from imaging observations, but may suffer from large uncertainties.
Therefore, by adopting head-on as well as oblique collision scenarios, we have
quantified the range of uncertainties involved in the calculation of the
coefficient of restitution for expanding magnetized plasmoids. Our study shows
that the comparatively large expansion speed of the following CME than that of
the preceding CME, results in a higher probability of super-elastic collision.
We also infer that a relative approaching speed of the CMEs lower than the sum
of their expansion speeds increases the chance of super-elastic collision. The
analysis under a reasonable errors in observed parameters of the CME, reveals
the larger probability of occurrence of an inelastic collision for the selected
CMEs. We suggest that the collision nature of two CMEs should be discussed in
3D, and the calculated value of the coefficient of restitution may suffer from
a large uncertainty.

charged particle tracking are considered as technology for numerous experiments
in heavy ion and particle physics. To match the requirements for those
applications in terms of tolerance to non-ionizing radiation, it is being tried
to deplete the sensitive volume of the, traditionally non-depleted, silicon
sensors.
  We study the feasibility of this approach for the common case that the
collection diodes of the pixel are small as compared to the pixel pitch. An
analytic equation predicting the thickness of the depletion depth and the
capacity of this point-like junction is introduced. We find that the
predictions of this equations differs qualitatively from the usual results for
flat PN junctions and that $dC/dU$-measurements are not suited to measure the
depletion depth of diodes with point-like geometry. The predictions of the
equation is compared with measurements on the depletion depth of CMOS sensors,
which were carried out with a novel measurement protocol. It is found that the
equation and the measurement results match with each other. By comparing our
findings with TCAD simulations, we find that precise simulation models matches
the empirical findings while simplified models overestimate the depletion depth
dramatically. A potential explanation for this finding is introduced and the
consequences for the design of CMOS sensors are discussed.

in road networks. The methodology we present can be used for distance join
processing among the elements of two disjoint sets R,S of nodes from the road
network, with R preceding S, and we are in search for the pairs of vertices
(u,v), where u in R and v in S, such that dist(u,v) < {\theta}. Another
variation of the problem would involve retrieving the k closest pairs (u,v) in
the road network with u in R and v in S, such that dist(u,v) <= dist(w,y),
where w,y do not belong in the result.
  We reckon that this is an extremely useful paradigm with many practical
applications. A typical example of usage of our methods would be to find the
pairs of restaurants and bars (in that order) from which to select for a night
out, that either fall within walking distance for example, or just the k
closest pairs, depending on the parameters. Another entirely different scenario
would involve finding the points of two distinct trajectories that are within a
certain distance predicate, or the k closest such points. For example, we would
like to transfer from one train to another a few tones of freight, and hence,
we want to minimize the distance we have to cover for moving the cargo from the
carrying train to the other. We reckon that this endeavor of ours covers
exactly those needs for processing such queries efficiently.
  Moreover, for the specific purposes of this paper, we also propose a novel
heuristic graph partitioning scheme. It resembles a recursive bisection method,
and is tailored to the requirements of the problem, targeting at establishing
well separated partitions, so as to allow computations to be performed
simultaneously and independently within each partition, unlike hitherto work
that aims at minimizing either the number of edges among different partitions,
or the number of nodes thereof.

properties of complex physical systems. In highly parameterised models there
often exist relationships between parameters over which model predictions are
identical, or nearly so. These are known as structural or practical
unidentifiabilities, respectively. They are hard to diagnose and make reliable
parameter estimation from data impossible. They furthermore imply the existence
of an underlying model simplification. We describe a scalable method for
detecting unidentifiabilities, and the functional relations defining them, for
generic models. This allows for model simplification, and appreciation of which
parameters (or functions thereof) cannot be estimated from data. Our algorithm
can identify features such as redundant mechanisms and fast timescale
subsystems, as well as the regimes in which such approximations are valid. We
base our algorithm on a novel quantification of regional parametric
sensitivity: multiscale sloppiness. Traditionally, the link between parametric
sensitivity and the conditioning of the parameter estimation problem is made
locally, through the Fisher Information Matrix. This is valid in the regime of
infinitesimal measurement uncertainty. We demonstrate the duality between
multiscale sloppiness and the geometry of confidence regions surrounding
parameter estimates made where measurement uncertainty is non-negligible.
Further theoretical relationships are provided linking multiscale sloppiness to
the Likelihood-ratio test. From this, we show that a local sensitivity analysis
(as typically done) is insufficient for determining the reliability of
parameter estimation, even with simple (non)linear systems. Our algorithm
provides a tractable alternative. We finally apply our methods to a
large-scale, benchmark Systems Biology model of NF-$\kappa$B, uncovering
previously unknown unidentifiabilities.

two adaptive code allocation algorithms for the adaptive OCDMA-PON are

binaries that will interact during their lifetime, and on the other, the most
dramatic example of an LBV, Eta Car, is a binary, it would be useful to find
other binary LBVs. We present here interferometric observations of the LBV HR

reveal that HR Car is a binary star. It is not yet possible to constrain fully
the orbit, and the orbital period may lie between a few years and several
hundred years. We derive a radius for the primary in the system and possibly
resolve as well the companion. The luminosity ratio in the H-band between the
two components is changing with time, going from about 6 to 9. We also
tentatively detect the presence of some background flux which remained at the
2% level until January 2016, but then increased to 6% in April 2016. Our AMBER
results show that the emission line forming region of Br gamma is more extended
than the continuum emitting region as seen by PIONIER and may indicate some
wind-wind interaction. Most importantly, we constrain the total masses of both
components, with the most likely range being 33.6 and 45 solar masses. Our
results show that the LBV HR Car is possibly an Eta Car analog binary system
with smaller masses, with variable components, and further monitoring of this

differential conductance spectra exhibit a bias-independent conductance plateau
(BICP) in the vicinity of zero bias below 7 K. As temperatures further decrease
a zero bias conductance peak (ZBCP) emerges from the plateau and becomes more
enhanced and sharpened at lower temperatures. Our numerically simulated
differential conductance spectra reproduce the observed BICP and ZBCP and show
that the SPE in topological surface states (TSS) is much stronger than that in
the bulk states of Bi2Se3. The SPE induced superconducting gap for the TSS of
Bi2Se3 is comparable to that of NbSe2 and gives rise to the observed BICP below
7 K. In contrast, the SPE induced superconducting gap for the bulk states of
Bi2Se3 is an order of magnitude smaller than that of NbSe2 and superconducting
TSS. These weakly paired bulk states in Bi2Se3 give rise to the ZBCP below 2 K.

X-ray/radio switching between a radio-bright (B) and a radio-quiet (Q) mode, in
which the X-ray flux is a factor ~2.4 higher than in the B-mode. We discovered
X-ray pulsations, with pulsed fraction of 38+/-5% (0.5-2 keV), during the
B-mode, and confirm their presence in Q-mode, where the pulsed fraction
increases with energy from ~20% up to ~65% at 2 keV. We found marginal evidence
for an increase in the X-ray pulsed fraction during B-mode on a timescale of
hours. The Q-mode X-ray spectrum requires a fit with a two-component model
(either a power-law plus blackbody or the sum of two blackbodies), while the
B-mode spectrum is well fit by a single blackbody (a single power-law is
rejected). With a maximum likelihood analysis, we found that in Q-mode the
pulsed emission has a thermal blackbody spectrum with temperature ~3.4x10^6 K
and the unpulsed emission is a power-law with photon index ~2.5, while during
B-mode both the pulsed and unpulsed emission can be fit by either a blackbody
or a power law with similar values of temperature and photon index. A Chandra
image shows no evidence for diffuse X-ray emission. These results support a
scenario in which both unpulsed non-thermal emission, likely of magnetospheric
origin, and pulsed thermal emission from a small polar cap (~1500 m^2) with a
strong non-dipolar magnetic field (~10^{14} G), are present during both radio

results are then used for construction of two reaction systems, which are at
the deterministic level described by two-dimensional third-degree kinetic ODEs.
The first system displays a homoclinic bifurcation, and a coexistence of a
stable critical point and a stable limit cycle in the phase plane. The second
system displays a multiple limit cycle bifurcation, and a coexistence of two
stable limit cycles. The deterministic solutions (obtained by solving the
kinetic ODEs) and stochastic solutions (noisy time-series generating by the
Gillespie algorithm, and the underlying probability distributions obtained by
solving the chemical master equation (CME)) of the constructed systems are
compared, and the observed differences highlighted. The constructed systems are
proposed as test problems for statistical methods, which are designed to detect
and classify properties of given noisy time-series arising from biological
applications.

signals in both time and frequency can be used to detect pulsars in large-scale
continuum surveys using the next generation of synthesis radio telescopes. This
technique allows a search over the full field of view while avoiding the need
for expensive pixel-by-pixel high time resolution searches. We investigate the
sensitivity of detecting pulsars in variance images. We show that variance
images are most sensitive to pulsars whose scintillation time-scales and
bandwidths are close to the subintegration time and channel bandwidth.
Therefore, in order to maximise the detection of pulsars for a given radio
continuum survey, it is essential to retain a high time and frequency
resolution, allowing us to make variance images sensitive to pulsars with
different scintillation properties. We demonstrate the technique with
Murchision Widefield Array data and show that variance images can indeed lead
to the detection of pulsars by distinguishing them from other radio sources.

QSO and the surrounding galaxies concertedly control the reionization
morphology of hydrogen and helium and have a non-linear impact on the thermal
structure of the IGM. A QSO imprints a distinctive morphology on H II regions
if its total ionizing photon budget exceeds that of the surrounding galaxies
since the onset of hydrogen reionization; otherwise, the morphology shows
little difference from that of H II regions produced only by galaxies. In
addition, the spectral shape of the collective radiation field from galaxies
and QSOs controls the thickness of the I-fronts. While a UV-obscured QSO can
broaden the I-front, the contribution from other UV sources, either galaxies or
unobscured QSO, is sufficient to maintain a sharp I-front. X-rays photons from
the QSO are responsible for a prominent extended tail of partial ionization
ahead of the I-front. QSOs leave a unique imprint on the morphology of He II /
He III regions. We suggest that, while the physical state of the IGM is
modified by QSOs, the most direct test to understand the role of galaxies and
QSOs during reionization is to perform galaxy surveys in a region of sky imaged

fast coronal mass ejection (CME) originating on 2015 March 15. It was an
initially west-oriented CME and expected to only cause a weak geomagnetic
disturbance. Why did this CME finally cause such a large geomagnetic storm? We
try to find some clues by investigating its propagation from the Sun to 1 AU.
First, we reconstruct the CME's kinematic properties in the corona from the
SOHO and SDO imaging data with the aid of the graduated cylindrical shell (GCS)
model. It is suggested that the CME propagated to the west
$\sim$$33^\circ$$\pm$$10^\circ$ away from the Sun-Earth line with a speed of
about 817 km s$^{-1}$ before leaving the field of view of the SOHO/LASCO C3
camera. A magnetic cloud (MC) corresponding to this CME was measured in-situ by
the Wind spacecraft two days later. By applying two MC reconstruction methods,
we infer the configuration of the MC as well as some kinematic information,
which implies that the CME possibly experienced an eastward deflection on its
way to 1 AU. However, due to the lack of observations from the STEREO
spacecraft, the CME's kinematic evolution in interplanetary space is not clear.
In order to fill this gap, we utilize numerical MHD simulation, drag-based CME
propagation model (DBM) and the model for CME deflection in interplanetary
space (DIPS) to recover the propagation process, especially the trajectory, of
the CME from $30 R_S$ to 1 AU. It is suggested that the trajectory of the CME
was deflected toward the Earth by about $12^\circ$, consistent with the
implication from the MC reconstruction at 1 AU. This eastward deflection
probably contributed to the CME's unexpected geoeffectiveness by pushing the
center of the initially west-oriented CME closer to the Earth.

feature of our definitions is that they precisely characterize the effective
behavior of any adversary when the authentication protocol accepts, including
correlations with the key. Our definitions readily yield a host of desirable
properties and interesting consequences; for example, our security definition
for full quantum state authentication implies that the entire secret key can be

  Next, we present several protocols satisfying our security definitions. We
show that the classical Wegman-Carter authentication scheme with 3-universal
hashing is secure against superposition attacks, as well as adversaries with
quantum side information. We then present conceptually simple constructions of
full quantum state authentication.
  Finally, we prove a lifting theorem which shows that, as long as a protocol
can securely authenticate the maximally entangled state, it can securely
authenticate any state, even those that are entangled with the adversary. Thus,
this shows that protocols satisfying a fairly weak form of authentication
security automatically satisfy a stronger notion of security (in particular,

practical problem for many-core systems, particularly hundreds-cores. Although
other researchers have focused on optimizing large meshes, bypassing or
speculating router pipelines, or creating more intricate logarithmic
topologies, this paper proposes a balanced combination that trades queue
buffers for simplicity. Preliminary analysis of nine benchmarks from PARSEC and
SPLASH using execution-driven simulation shows that utilization rises from 2%
when connecting a single core per mesh port to at least 50%, as slack for delay
in concentrator and router queues is around 6x higher compared to the ideal
latency of just 20 cycles. That is, a 16-port mesh suffices because queueing is
the uncommon case for system performance. In this way, the mesh hop count is
bounded to three, as load becomes uniform via extended concentration, and ideal
latency is approached using conventional four-stage pipelines for the mesh
routers together with minor logarithmic edges. A realistic Uber is also
detailed, featuring the same performance as a 64-port mesh that employs
optimized router pipelines, improving the baseline by 12%. Ongoing work
develops techniques to better balance load by tuning the placement of cache
blocks, and compares Uber with bufferless routing.

This differentiates the QAH from the quantum Hall (QH) state for the

$\sigma_{xy}= e^2/h$ ($\sigma_{xy}= -e^2/h$) plateau in

predict a new transition between the quantum spin Hall (QSH) and the QAH state

impurities but driven by effective g-factors and particle-hole asymmetry. This
transition can be related to the stability of edge states in the Dirac mass gap

climate models in 1969, each with a goal of investigating the role played by
positive ice albedo feedback in climate dynamics. In this paper we replace the
relaxation to the mean horizontal heat transport mechanism used in the models
of Budyko and Sellers with diffusive heat transport. We couple the resulting
surface temperature equation with an equation for movement of the edge of the
ice sheet (called the ice line), recently introduced by E. Widiasih. We apply
the spectral method to the temperature-ice line system and consider finite
approximations. We prove there exists a stable equilibrium solution with a
small ice cap, and an unstable equilibrium solution with a large ice cap, for a
range of parameter values. If the diffusive transport is too efficient,
however, the small ice cap disappears and an ice free Earth becomes a limiting
state. In addition, we analyze a variant of the coupled diffusion equations
appropriate as a model for extensive glacial episodes in the Neoproterozoic
Era. Although the model equations are no longer smooth due to the existence of
a switching boundary, we prove there exists a unique stable equilibrium
solution with the ice line in tropical latitudes, a climate event known as a
Jormungand or Waterbelt state. As the systems introduced here contain variables
with differing time scales, the main tool used in the analysis is geometric
singular perturbation theory.

semantic video segmentation. Given a video, the goal is to accurately assign a
semantic class label to every pixel in the video within a specified time
budget. Typical approaches to such labeling problems, such as Conditional
Random Fields (CRFs), focus on maximizing accuracy but do not provide a
principled method for satisfying a time budget. For video data, the time
required by CRF and related methods is often dominated by the time to compute
low-level descriptors of supervoxels across the video. Our key contribution is
the new budgeted inference framework for CRF models that intelligently selects
the most useful subsets of descriptors to run on subsets of supervoxels within
the time budget. The objective is to maintain an accuracy as close as possible
to the CRF model with no time bound, while remaining within the time budget.
Our second contribution is the algorithm for learning a policy for the sparse
selection of supervoxels and their descriptors for budgeted CRF inference. This
learning algorithm is derived by casting our problem in the framework of Markov
Decision Processes, and then instantiating a state-of-the-art policy learning
algorithm known as Classification-Based Approximate Policy Iteration. Our
experiments on multiple video datasets show that our learning approach and
framework is able to significantly reduce computation time, and maintain
competitive accuracy under varying budgets.

statistics, with its core concepts and perspectives in place. Despite this,
there are still fundamental statistical questions which have received
relatively little attention. One of these is the systematic construction of
confidence regions for functional parameters. This work is concerned with
developing, understanding, and visualizing such regions. We provide a general
strategy for constructing confidence regions in a real separable Hilbert space
using hyper-ellipsoids and hyper-rectangles. We then propose specific
implementations which work especially well in practice. They provide powerful
hypothesis tests and useful visualization tools without using any simulation.
We also demonstrate the negative result that nearly all regions, including our
own, have zero-coverage when working with empirical covariances. To overcome
this challenge we propose a new paradigm for evaluating confidence regions by
showing that the distance between an estimated region and the desired region
(with proper coverage) tends to zero faster than the regions shrink to a point.
We call this phenomena ghosting and refer to the empirical regions as ghost
regions. We illustrate the proposed methods in a simulation study and an
application to fractional anisotropy tract profile data.

agrees with recent theoretical findings. Finally, the degree of localization of
