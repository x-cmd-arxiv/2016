hydrophobic-hydrophobic interactions between graphene and UHMWPE, which is one
of most facile and cheapest transfer methods that are currently available,
especially for large-area graphene preparation and transfer. Multi-layer
sandwich structure composite membrane of graphene and UHMWPE with desired

The most significant applications of this transfer method lie on that it
facilitates thin polymer membranes the possibilities to be directly observed
with high magnification by electron microscopes, such as SEM and TEM. Thus the
crystallization and phase-behavior of polymers including UHMWPE can be
investigated with real-time and in-situ morphological observations, even in the

the case of an ideal gas, we recover the Boussinesq results only if the ratio

the central star into a binary, whose components are nearly equal in brightness
and separated by 0.106"" +/- 0.001"". VHS 1256 b occupies nearly the same near-IR
color-magnitude diagram position as HR 8799 bcde and has a comparable L'
brightness. However, it has a substantially redder H - M' color, implying a
relatively brighter M' flux density than for the HR 8799 planets and suggesting
that non-equilibrium carbon chemistry may be less significant in VHS 1256 b. We
successfully match the entire SED (optical through thermal infrared) for VHS
1256 b to atmospheric models assuming chemical equilibrium, models which failed
to reproduce HR 8799 b at 5 microns. Our modeling favors slightly thick clouds
in the companion's atmosphere, although perhaps not quite as thick as those
favored recently for HR 8799 bcde. We estimate that the system is at least
older than 200 Myr and the masses of the stars comprising the central binary
are at least 58 M_Jup each. Moreover, we find some of the properties of VHS
1256 are inconsistent with the recent suggestion that it is a member of the AB
Dor moving group. Given the possible ranges in distance (12.7 pc vs. 17.1 pc),
the lower mass limit for VHS 1256 b ranges from 10.5 - 26.2 M_Jup. Our
detection limits rule out companions more massive than VHS 1256 b exterior to
6-8 au, placing significant limits on and providing some evidence against a
second, more massive companion that may have scattered the wide-separation
companion to its current location. VHS 1256 is most likely a very low mass
hierarchical triple system, and could be the third such system in which all
components reside in the brown dwarf mass regime.

(ii) the chain formation of two disks. For the periodic interaction of two
disks, two different motions are obtained: (a) two disks stay far apart and
interact periodically and (b) two disks interact closely and then far apart in
a periodic way, like the drafting, kissing and tumbling of two disks
sedimenting in Newtonian fluid, due to the lack of strong enough elastic force.
For the formation of two disk chain occurred at higher values of the elasticity
number, it is either a tilted chain or a vertical chain. The tilted chain can
be obtained for either that the elasticity number is less than the critical
value for having the vertical chain or that the Mach number is greater than the

States has grown rapidly in recent years. As a result, there is substantial
interest in high quality information about the quantity, power capacity, and
energy generated by such arrays, including at a high spatial resolution (e.g.,
counties, cities, or even smaller regions). Unfortunately, existing methods for
obtaining this information, such as surveys and utility interconnection
filings, are limited in their completeness and spatial resolution. This work
presents a computer algorithm that automatically detects PV panels using very
high resolution color satellite imagery. The approach potentially offers a
fast, scalable method for obtaining accurate information on PV array location
and size, and at much higher spatial resolutions than are currently available.
The method is validated using a very large (135 km^2) collection of publicly
available [1] aerial imagery, with over 2,700 human annotated PV array
locations. The results demonstrate the algorithm is highly effective on a
per-pixel basis. It is likewise effective at object-level PV array detection,
but with significant potential for improvement in estimating the precise
shape/size of the PV arrays. These results are the first of their kind for the
detection of solar PV in aerial imagery, demonstrating the feasibility of the
approach and establishing a baseline performance for future investigations.

the particle's inclination angle to the wall. We analyse the correction for
translational and rotational motion, as well as the translation-rotation

(asymptotically) optimal since they are able to achieve the exact tail index.

properties for a particular device class, yet these properties ultimately
originate in the linear and nonlinear susceptibilities of the material which
are not independent of each other. In this work, we calculate the electro-optic
device figure of merit based on the half-wave voltage and linear loss, which is
important for phase modulators and serves as the simplest example of the
approach. This figure of merit is then related back to the microscopic
properties in the context of a dye-doped polymer, and its fundamental limits
are obtained to provide a target. Surprisingly, the largest figure of merit is
not always associated with a large nonlinear-optical response, the quantity
that is most often the focus of optimization. An important lesson to materials
design is that the figure of merit alone should be optimized. The best device
materials can have low nonlinearity provided that the loss is low; or, near
resonance high loss may be desirable because it is accompanied by
resonantly-enhanced, ultra-large nonlinear response so device lengths are
short. Our work shows which frequency range of operation is most promising for
optimizing the material figure of merit for electro-optic devices.

interacting agents Trophallaxis, the regurgitation and mouth to mouth transfer
of liquid food between members of eusocial insect societies, is an important
process that allows the fast and efficient dissemination of food in the colony.
Trophallactic systems are typically treated as a network of agent interactions.
This approach, though valuable, does not easily lend itself to analytic
predictions. In this work we consider a simple trophallactic system of randomly
interacting agents with finite carrying capacity, and calculate analytically
and via a series of simulations the global food intake rate for the whole
colony as well as observables describing how uniformly the food is distributed
within the nest. Our work serves as a stepping stone to describing the
collective properties of more complex trophallactic systems, such as those
including division of labor between foragers and workers.

one dimension, including stochastic Potts models, to a universal limiting
object, the continuum voter model perturbation. The perturbations can be
described in terms of bulk and boundary nucleations of new colors (opinions).
The discrete and continuum (space) models are obtained from their respective
duals, the discrete net with killing and Brownian net with killing. These
determine the color genealogy by means of reduced graphs. We focus our
attention on models where the voter and boundary nucleation dynamics depend
only on the colors of nearest neighbor sites, for which convergence of the
discrete net with killing to its continuum analog was proved in an earlier
paper by the authors. We use some detailed properties of the Brownian net with
killing to prove voter model perturbations convergence to its continuum
counterpart. A crucial property of reduced graphs is that even in the
continuum, they are finite almost surely. An important issue is how vertices of
the continuum reduced graphs are strongly approximated by their discrete
analogues.

the proposed algorithm allows in principle to make predictions outside the

existence of additive spanners (subgraphs where all distances are preserved up
to an additive stretch), distance preservers (subgraphs in which demand pairs
have their distance preserved exactly), and pairwise spanners (subgraphs in
which demand pairs have their distance preserved up to a multiplicative or
additive stretch) [Abboud-Godwin SODA '16, Godwin-Williams SODA '16]. We study
these problems from an optimization point of view, where rather than studying
the existence of extremal instances we are given an instance and are asked to
find the sparsest possible spanner/preserver. We give an $O(n^{3/5 +
\epsilon})$-approximation for distance preservers and pairwise spanners (for
arbitrary constant $\epsilon > 0$). This is the first nontrivial upper bound
for either problem, both of which are known to be as hard to approximate as
Label Cover. We also prove Label Cover hardness for approximating additive
spanners, even for the cases of additive 1 stretch (where one might expect a
polylogarithmic approximation, since the related multiplicative 2-spanner
problem admits an $O(\log n)$-approximation) and additive polylogarithmic
stretch (where the related multiplicative spanner problem has an
$O(1)$-approximation).
  Interestingly, the techniques we use in our approximation algorithm extend
beyond distance-based problem to pure connectivity network design problems. In
particular, our techniques allow us to give an $O(n^{3/5 +
\epsilon})$-approximation for the Directed Steiner Forest problem (for
arbitrary constant $\epsilon > 0$) when all edges have uniform costs, improving
the previous best $O(n^{2/3 + \epsilon})$-approximation due to Berman et

index, effective radius, star formation rate (SFR) density and stellar mass
density in the SFR-M* plane. We then define a redshift dependent main sequence
and examine the medians of these quantities as a function of distance from this
main sequence, both above (higher SFRs) and below (lower SFRs). Finally, we
examine the distributions of distance from the main sequence in bins of these
quantities. We find strong correlations between all of these galaxy structural
properties and the distance from the SFMS, such that as we move from galaxies
above the SFMS to those below it, we see a nearly monotonic trend towards
higher median Sersic index, smaller radius, lower SFR density, and higher
stellar density. In the semi-analytic model, bulge growth is driven by mergers
and disk instabilities, and is accompanied by the growth of a supermassive
black hole which can regulate or quench star formation via Active Galactic
Nucleus (AGN) feedback. We find that our model qualitatively reproduces the
trends described above, supporting a picture in which black holes and bulges
co-evolve, and AGN feedback plays a critical role in moving galaxies off of the

ranges. We focus particularly on PBHs generated by inflation, pointing out
which effects in the formation process influence the mapping from the
inflationary power spectrum to the PBH mass function. We then apply our scheme
to two specific inflationary models in which PBHs provide the dark matter. The
possibility that the dark matter is in intermediate-mass PBHs of $1$ -
$10^{3}\,M_{\odot}$ is of special interest in view of the recent detection of
black-hole mergers by LIGO. The possibility of Planck relics is also intriguing
but virtually untestable.

state-of-the-art stellar population synthesis and photoionization codes to
describe the ensemble of HII regions and the diffuse gas ionized by young stars
in a galaxy. A main feature of this model is the self-consistent yet versatile
treatment of element abundances and depletion onto dust grains, which allows
one to relate the observed nebular emission from a galaxy to both gas-phase and
dust-phase metal enrichment. We show that this model can account for the
rest-frame ultraviolet and optical emission-line properties of galaxies at
different redshifts and find that ultraviolet emission lines are more sensitive
than optical ones to parameters such as C/O abundance ratio, hydrogen gas
density, dust-to-metal mass ratio and upper cutoff of the stellar initial mass
function. We also find that, for gas-phase metallicities around solar to
slightly sub-solar, widely used formulae to constrain oxygen ionic fractions
and the C/O ratio from ultraviolet and optical emission-line luminosities are
reasonable faithful. However, the recipes break down at non-solar
metallicities, making them inappropriate to study chemically young galaxies. In
such cases, a fully self-consistent model of the kind presented in this paper

QGs are 0.5-2 Gyr older than normal-sized ones. The evidence comes from three
different age indicators, Dn4000, Hdelta and fits to spectral synthesis models,
applied to their stacked optical spectra. All age indicators consistently show
that the stellar populations of compact QGs are older than their normally-sized
counterparts. We detect weak [OII] emission in a fraction of QGs, and the
strength of the line, when present, is similar between the two samples;
however, compact galaxies exhibit significantly lower frequency of [OII]
emission than normal ones. A fraction of both samples are individually detected
in 7 Ms Chandra X-ray images (luminosities$\sim10^{40}$-$10^{41}$ erg/sec). 7
Ms stacks of non-detected galaxies show similarly low luminosities in the soft
band only, consistent with a hot gas origin for the X-ray emission. While both
[OII] emitters and non-emitters are also X-ray sources among normal galaxies,
no compact galaxy with [OII] emission is an X-ray source, arguing against an
AGN powering the line in compact galaxies. We interpret the [OII] properties as
further evidence that compact galaxies are older and further along into the
process of quenching star-formation and suppressing gas accretion. Finally, we
argue that the older age of compact QGs is evidence of progenitor bias: compact
QGs simply reflect the smaller sizes of galaxies at their earlier quenching
epoch, with stellar density most likely having nothing directly to do with
cessation of star-formation.

that its quantum value for a given state, and for appropriate observables,
corresponds to the energy of the state. Thus, the presence of nonlocal
correlations can be certified for states of low enough energy. The method can
also be used to optimize certain Bell inequalities: in the translationally
invariant (TI) case, we provide an exponentially faster computation of the
classical bound and analytically closed expressions of the quantum value for
appropriate observables and Hamiltonians. The power and generality of our
method is illustrated through four representative examples: a tight TI
inequality for 8 parties, a quasi TI uniparametric inequality for any even
number of parties, ground states of spin-glass systems, and a non-integrable

low-energy states of commonly studied Hamiltonians as multipartite resources

density in the inner kpc. Although both the host halo mass and group-centric
distance affect the satellite population, we find that these can be
characterised by a single number, the quenched fraction, such that key features
of the sSFR-$\Sigma_{1kpc}$ diagram vary smoothly with this proxy for the
""environment"". Particularly, the sSFR of star-forming galaxies decreases
smoothly with this quenched fraction, the sSFR of satellites being 0.1 dex
lower than in the field. Furthermore, $\Sigma_{1kpc}$ of the transition
galaxies (i.e., the ""green valley"" or GV) decreases smoothly with the
environment, by as much as 0.2 dex for $M_* = 10^{9.75-10} M_{\odot}$ from the
field, and decreasing for satellites in larger halos and at smaller radial
distances within same-mass halos. We interpret this shift as indicating the
relative importance of today's field quenching track vs. the cluster quenching
track. These environmental effects in the sSFR-$\Sigma_{1kpc}$ diagram are most
significant in our lowest mass range ($9.75 < \log M_{*}/M_{\odot} < 10$). One
feature that is shared between all environments is that at a given $M_{*}$
quenched galaxies have about 0.2-0.3 dex higher $\Sigma_{1kpc}$ than the
star-forming population. These results indicate that either $\Sigma_{1kpc}$
increases (subsequent to satellite quenching), or $\Sigma_{1kpc}$ for
individual galaxies remains unchanged, but the original $M_*$ or the time of
quenching is significantly different from those now in the GV.

(e.g. pseudogap, antiferromagnetism, and superconductivity) is one of the
central questions in the cuprate high-temperature superconductors. The
discovery that similar forms of CO exist in both hole- and electron-doped
cuprates opened a path to determine what subset of the CO phenomenology is
universal to all the cuprates. Here, we use resonant x-ray scattering to
measure the charge order correlations in electron-doped cuprates (La2-xCexCuO4
and Nd2-xCexCuO4) and their relationship to antiferromagnetism, pseudogap, and
superconductivity. Detailed measurements of Nd2-xCexCuO4 show that CO is
present in the x = 0.059 to 0.166 range, and that its doping dependent
wavevector is consistent with the separation between straight segments of the
Fermi surface. The CO onset temperature is highest between x = 0.106 and 0.166,
but decreases at lower doping levels, indicating that it is not tied to the
appearance of antiferromagnetic correlations or the pseudogap. Near optimal
doping, where the CO wavevector is also consistent with a previously observed
phonon anomaly, measurements of the CO below and above the superconducting
transition temperature, or in a magnetic field, show that the CO is insensitive
to superconductivity. Overall these findings indicate that, while verified in
the electron-doped cuprates, material-dependent details determine whether the
CO correlations acquire sufficient strength to compete for the ground state of
the cuprates.

mass and angular momentum losses. Observations of open clusters have revealed a
bimodal distribution of the rotation periods of solar-like stars that has
proven difficult to explain under the existing rubric of magnetic braking.
Recent studies suggest that magnetic complexity can play an important role in
controlling stellar spin-down rates. However, magnetic morphology is still
neglected in most rotation evolution models due to the difficulty of properly
accounting for its effects on wind driving and angular momentum loss. Using
state-of-the-art magnetohydrodynamical magnetized wind simulations we study the
effect that different distributions of the magnetic flux at different levels of
geometrical complexity have on mass and angular momentum loss rates. Angular
momentum loss rates depend strongly on the level of complexity of the field but
are independent of the way this complexity is distributed. We deduce the
analytical terms representing the magnetic field morphology dependence of mass
and angular momentum loss rates. We also define a parameter that best
represents complexity for real stars. As a test, we use these analytical
methods to estimate mass and angular momentum loss rates for $8$ stars with
observed magnetograms and compare them to the simulated results. Magnetic field
complexity provides a natural physical basis for stellar rotation evolution
models requiring a rapid transition between weak and strong spin-down modes.

DR12 CMASS sample of $777,202$ Luminous Red Galaxies, the largest-ever sample
used for a 3PCF or bispectrum measurement. We make the first high-significance
($4.5\sigma$) detection of Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAO) in the 3PCF.
Using these acoustic features in the 3PCF as a standard ruler, we measure the
distance to $z=0.57$ to $1.7\%$ precision (statistical plus systematic). We
find $D_{\rm V}= 2024\pm29\;{\rm Mpc\;(stat)}\pm20\;{\rm Mpc\;(sys)}$ for our
fiducial cosmology (consistent with Planck 2015) and bias model. This
measurement extends the use of the BAO technique from the 2-point correlation
function (2PCF) and power spectrum to the 3PCF and opens an avenue for deriving
additional cosmological distance information from future large-scale structure
redshift surveys such as DESI. Our measured distance scale from the 3PCF is
fairly independent from that derived from the pre-reconstruction 2PCF and is
equivalent to increasing the length of BOSS by roughly 10\%; reconstruction
appears to lower the independence of the distance measurements. Fitting a model
including tidal tensor bias yields a moderate significance ($2.6\sigma)$
detection of this bias with a value in agreement with the prediction from local
Lagrangian biasing.

evolution models. If the efficiency of converting accreted baryons into stars
varies with time, halos of the same present-day mass but different formation
histories will have different z=0 galaxy stellar mass. This is one of the
sources of scatter in stellar mass at fixed halo mass, $\sigma_{\log M\ast}$.
For massive halos that undergo rapid quenching of star formation at z~2,
different mechanisms that trigger this quenching yield different values of
$\sigma_{\log M\ast}$. We use this framework to test various models in which
quenching begins after a galaxy crosses a threshold in one of the following
physical quantities: redshift, halo mass, stellar mass, and stellar-to-halo
mass ratio. Our model is highly idealized, with other sources of scatter likely
to arise as more physics is included. Thus, our test is whether a model can
produce scatter lower than observational bounds, leaving room for other
sources. Recent measurements find $\sigma_{\log M\ast}=0.16$ dex for 10^11 Msol
galaxies. Under the assumption that the threshold is constant with time, such a
low value of $\sigma_{\log M\ast}$ rules out all of these models with the
exception of quenching by a stellar mass treshold. Most physical quantities,
such as metallicity, will increase scatter if they are uncorrelated with halo
formation history. Thus, to decrease the scatter of a given model, galaxy
properties would correlate tightly with formation history, creating testable
predictions for their clustering. Understanding why $\sigma_{\log M\ast}$ is so
small may be key to understanding the physics of galaxy formation.

10 km s$^{-1}$, at 4.0 $\times$ 10$^{16}$ cm. This mass-loss rate is too high
for most known stars, except perhaps hypergiant stars. A higher wind velocity
would lead to a correspondingly higher mass-loss rate. A Luminous Blue Variable
star undergoing a giant eruption could potentially fulfill this requirement,
but would need a high mass-loss rate lasting for several hundred years, and
need to explain the plateau observed in the optical light curve. The latter
could perhaps be due to the ejecta expanding in the dense circumstellar
material at relatively small radii. These observations are consistent with the
fact that Type IIn SNe appear to expand into high density and high mass-loss

spherically symmetric trapping horizon in Vaidya spacetime. The effective field
equations are that of a Chern-Simons theory coupled to bulk sources through two
different couplings, one is purely geometric and the other is matter dependent.
This is an effective generalization of the equilibrium horizon scenario where
the Chern-Simons theory is coupled to the bulk geometry through a constant
matter-independent coupling. Further, we note that the field equations
pulled-back to a cross-section of the horizon is inadequate to manifest the
nature of the horizon. Hence, contrary to the usual practice, the evolution
equation needs to be considered at least while passing on to the quantum
theory.

of the SU(3) color gauge group, an infrared fixed point of the $\beta$-function
was recently reported in the theory (Cheng:2014jba) with uncertainty in the
location of the critical gauge coupling inside the narrow $[ 6.0<g_*^2<6.4]$

fixed point and scale invariance in the theory with model-building
implications. Using the exact same renormalization scheme as the previous
study, we show that no fixed point of the $\beta$-function exists in the
reported interval. Our findings eliminate the only seemingly credible evidence
for conformal fixed point and scale invariance in the $N_f=12$ model whose
infrared properties remain unresolved. The implications of the recently
completed 5-loop QCD beta function for arbitrary flavor number are discussed

scene text recognition. We propose a cascade approach that incorporates a
convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture followed by a long short term
memory model (LSTM). The CNN learns visual features for the characters and uses
them with a softmax layer to detect sequence of characters. While the CNN gives
very good recognition results, it does not model relation between characters,
hence gives rise to false positive and false negative cases (confusing
characters due to visual similarities like ""g"" and ""9"", or confusing background
patches with characters; either removing existing characters or adding
non-existing ones) To alleviate these problems we leverage recent developments
in LSTM architectures to encode contextual information. We show that the LSTM
can dramatically reduce such errors and achieve state-of-the-art accuracy in
the task of unconstrained natural scene text recognition. Moreover we manually
remove all occurrences of the words that exist in the test set from our
training set to test whether our approach will generalize to unseen data. We
use the ICDAR 13 test set for evaluation and compare the results with the state
of the art approaches [11, 18]. We finally present an application of the work

$q$-dependent if there are no pairwise disjoint $F_1\in \mathcal F_1,\ldots,

$\max |\mathcal F_1|+\ldots +|\mathcal F_s| $ for all values $n\ge q,s\ge 2$.
The result provides a far-reaching generalization of an important classical
result of Kleitman.
  The well-known Erd\H os Matching Conjecture suggests the largest size of a
family $\mathcal F\subset {[n]\choose k}$ with no $s$ pairwise disjoint sets.
After more than 50 years its full solution is still not in sight. In the
present paper, we provide a Hilton-Milner-type stability theorem for the
Erd\H{o}s Matching Conjecture in a relatively wide range, in particular, for
$n\ge (2+o(1))sk$ with $o(1)$ depending on $s$ only. This is a considerable
improvement of a classical result due to Bollob\'as, Daykin and Erd\H{o}s.
  We apply our results to advance in the following anti-Ramsey-type problem,
proposed by \""Ozkahya and Young. Let $ar(n,k,s)$ be the minimum number $x$ of
colors such that in any coloring of the $k$-element subsets of $[n]$ with $x$
(non-empty) colors there is a \textit{rainbow matching} of size $s$, that is,
$s$ sets of different colors that are pairwise disjoint. We prove a stability
result for the problem, which allows to determine $ar(n,k,s)$ for all $k\ge 3$

algorithms that provides an intuitive, yet powerful stochastic order between
the compared algorithms. Accordingly this holds for bijective analysis, which
can be interpreted as stochastic dominance assuming the uniform distribution
over requests. These techniques have been applied to some online problems, and
have provided a clear separation between algorithms whose performance varies
significantly in practice. However, there are situations in which they are not
readily applicable due to the fact that they stipulate a stringent relation
between the compared algorithms.
  In this paper, we propose remedies for these shortcomings. First, we
establish sufficient conditions that allow us to prove the bijective optimality
of a certain class of algorithms for a wide range of problems; we demonstrate
this approach in the context of some well-studied online problems. Second, to
account for situations in which two algorithms are incomparable or there is no
clear optimum, we introduce the bijective ratio as a natural extension of
(exact) bijective analysis. Our definition readily generalizes to stochastic
dominance. This renders the concept of bijective analysis (and that of
stochastic dominance) applicable to all online problems, and allows for the
incorporation of other useful techniques such as amortized analysis. We
demonstrate the applicability of the bijective ratio to one of the fundamental
online problems, namely the continuous $k$-server problem on metrics such as
the line, the circle, and the star. Among other results, we show that the
greedy algorithm attains bijective ratios of $O(k)$ consistently across these
metrics. These results confirm extensive previous studies that gave evidence of
the efficiency of this algorithm on said metrics in practice, which, however,
is not reflected in competitive analysis.

relation may contain cycles. We show that, for any $\varepsilon>0$, the
triangles can be cut into $O(n^{3/2+\varepsilon})$ connected semi-algebraic
pieces, whose description complexity depends only on the choice of
$\varepsilon$, such that the depth relation among these pieces is now a proper
partial order. This bound is nearly tight in the worst case. We are not aware
of any previous study of this problem, in this full generality, with a
subquadratic bound on the number of pieces.
  This work extends the recent study by two of the authors (Aronov,
Sharir~2018) on eliminating depth cycles among lines in 3-space. Our approach
is again algebraic, and makes use of a recent variant of the polynomial
partitioning technique, due to Guth, which leads to a recursive procedure for
cutting the triangles. In contrast to the case of lines, our analysis here is
considerably more involved, due to the two-dimensional nature of the objects
being cut, so additional tools, from topology and algebra, need to be brought
to bear.
  Our result essentially settles a 35-year-old open problem in computational
geometry, motivated by hidden-surface removal in computer graphics.

been our best explanation of the relative power of various types of
multiprocessor synchronization objects when used in deterministic algorithms.
However, key to this hierarchy is treating synchronization instructions as
distinct objects, an approach that is far from the real-world, where
multiprocessor programs apply synchronization instructions to collections of
arbitrary memory locations. We were surprised to realize that, when considering
instructions applied to memory locations, the computability based hierarchy
collapses. This leaves open the question of how to better capture the power of
various synchronization instructions.
  In this paper, we provide an approach to answering this question. We present
a hierarchy of synchronization instructions, classified by their space
complexity in solving obstruction-free consensus. Our hierarchy provides a
classification of combinations of known instructions that seems to fit with our
intuition of how useful some are in practice, while questioning the
effectiveness of others. We prove an essentially tight characterization of the
power of buffered read and write instructions.Interestingly, we show a similar
result for multi-location atomic assignments.

videos creates distortions that will eventually be perceived by a human
observer. Vice versa, image and video restoration techniques, such as
inpainting or denoising, aim to enhance the quality of experience of human
viewers. Correctly assessing the similarity between an image and an undistorted
reference image as subjectively experienced by a human viewer can thus lead to
significant improvements in any transmission, compression, or restoration
system. This paper introduces the Haar wavelet-based perceptual similarity
index (HaarPSI), a novel and computationally inexpensive similarity measure for
full reference image quality assessment. The HaarPSI utilizes the coefficients
obtained from a Haar wavelet decomposition to assess local similarities between
two images, as well as the relative importance of image areas. The consistency
of the HaarPSI with the human quality of experience was validated on four large
benchmark databases containing thousands of differently distorted images. On
these databases, the HaarPSI achieves higher correlations with human opinion
scores than state-of-the-art full reference similarity measures like the
structural similarity index (SSIM), the feature similarity index (FSIM), and
the visual saliency-based index (VSI). Along with the simple computational
structure and the short execution time, these experimental results suggest a
high applicability of the HaarPSI in real world tasks.

remains poorly understood. In this paper we consider the computational
complexity of accurately answering a family $Q$ of statistical queries over a
data universe $X$ under differential privacy. A statistical query on a dataset
$D \in X^n$ asks ""what fraction of the elements of $D$ satisfy a given
predicate $p$ on $X$?"" Dwork et al. (STOC'09) and Boneh and Zhandry (CRYPTO'14)
showed that if both $Q$ and $X$ are of polynomial size, then there is an
efficient differentially private algorithm that accurately answers all the
queries, and if both $Q$ and $X$ are exponential size, then under a plausible
assumption, no efficient algorithm exists.
  We show that, under the same assumption, if either the number of queries or
the data universe is of exponential size, and the other has size at least
$\tilde{O}(n^7)$, then there is no differentially private algorithm that
answers all the queries. In both cases, the result is nearly quantitatively
tight, since there is an efficient differentially private algorithm that
answers $\tilde{\Omega}(n^2)$ queries on an exponential size data universe, and
one that answers exponentially many queries on a data universe of size
$\tilde{\Omega}(n^2)$.
  Our proofs build on the connection between hardness results in differential
privacy and traitor-tracing schemes (Dwork et al., STOC'09; Ullman, STOC'13).
We prove our hardness result for a polynomial size query set (resp., data
universe) by showing that they follow from the existence of a special type of
traitor-tracing scheme with very short ciphertexts (resp., secret keys), but
very weak security guarantees, and then constructing such a scheme.

sedimentation of circular particles in two-dimensional channel filled with a
viscoelastic fluid of FENE-CR type, which is generalized from a
domain/distributed Lagrange multiplier method with a factorization approach for
Oldroyd-B fluids developed in [J. Non-Newtonian Fluid Mech. 156 (2009) 95].
Numerical results suggest that the polymer extension limit L for the FENE-CR
fluid has no effect on the final formation of vertical chain for the cases of
two disks and three disks in two-dimensional narrow channel, at least for the
values of L considered in this article; but the intermediate dynamics of
particle interaction before having a vertical chain can be different for the
smaller values of L when increasing the relaxation time. For the cases of six
particles sedimenting in FENE-CR type viscoelastic fluid, the formation of
chain of 4 to 6 disks does depend on the polymer extension limit L. For the
smaller values of L, FENE-CR type viscoelastic fluid can not bring them
together like the case of these particles settling in a vertical chain
formation in Oldroyd-B fluid; but two separated chains of three disks are
formed. Similar results for the case of ten disks are also obtained. The
numerical results of several more particle cases suggest that for smaller
values of L, the length of the vertical chain is shorter and the size of
cluster is smaller.

as far as possible. He successfully applied this idea to Newton's
gravitostatics and to Maxwell's electrodynamics, where Kottler recast the field
equations in premetric form and specified a metric-dependent constitutive law.
We will discuss the basics of the premetric approach and some of its beautiful
consequences, like the division of universal constants into two classes. We
show that classical electrodynamics can be developed without a metric quite
straightforwardly: the Maxwell equations, together with a local and linear
response law for electromagnetic media, admit a consistent premetric
formulation. Kottler's program succeeds here without provisos. In Kottler's
approach to gravity, making the theory relativistic, two premetric
quasi-Maxwellian field equations arise, but their field variables, if
interpreted in terms of general relativity, do depend on the metric. However,
one can hope to bring the Kottler idea to work by using the teleparallelism
equivalent of general relativity, where the gravitational potential, the
coframe, can be chosen in a premetric way.

long-range electrostatic repulsion among charged head groups delays or inhibits
the lateral phase separation in charged vesicles compared with neutral
vesicles, suggesting the transition of the phase-separation mechanism from
spinodal decomposition to nucleation or homogeneous dispersion. Moreover, the
electrostatic repulsion causes morphological changes, such as pore formation,

Based on our coarse-grained MD simulation, we propose a plausible mechanism of

networked systems of scientific interest are characterized by temporal links.
By disrupting the paths, link temporality has been shown to frustrate many
dynamical processes on networks, from information spreading to accessibility.
Considering the ubiquity of temporal networks in nature, we must ask: Are there
any advantages of the networks' temporality? Here we develop an analytical
framework to explore the control properties of temporal networks, arriving at
the counterintuitive conclusion that temporal networks, compared to their
static (i.e. aggregated) counterparts, reach controllability faster, demand
orders of magnitude less control energy, and the control trajectories, through
which the system reaches its final states, are significantly more compact than
those characterizing their static counterparts. The combination of analytical,
numerical and empirical results demonstrates that temporality ensures a degree
of flexibility that would be unattainable in static networks, significantly
enhancing our ability to control them.

concentration of the limit measures are obtained. In particular, we show that
if the noise perturbed systems admit a uniform Lyapunov function, then the
stationary measures form a relatively sequentially compact set whose
weak$^*$-limits are invariant measures of the unperturbed system concentrated
on its global attractor. In the case that the global attractor contains a
strong local attractor, we further show that there exists a family of
admissible multiplicative noises with respect to which all limit measures are
actually concentrated on the local attractor; and on the contrary, in the
presence of a strong local repeller in the global attractor, there exists a
family of admissible multiplicative noises with respect to which no limit
measure can be concentrated on the local repeller. Moreover, we show that if
there is a strongly repelling equilibrium in the global attractor, then limit
measures with respect to typical families of multiplicative noises are always
concentrated away from the equilibrium. As applications of these results, an
example of stochastic Hopf bifurcation is provided.
  Our study is closely related to the problem of noise stability of compact

locality-sensitive hashing (LSH) framework due to its appealing asymptotic
sublinear query time for near neighbor search problems in high-dimensional
space. A bottleneck of the traditional LSH scheme for solving $r$-NN is that
its performance is sensitive to data and query-dependent parameters. On
datasets whose data distributions have diverse local density patterns, LSH with
inappropriate tuning parameters can sometimes be outperformed by a simple
linear search.
  In this paper, we introduce a hybrid search strategy between LSH-based search
and linear search for $r$-NN in high-dimensional space. By integrating an
auxiliary data structure into LSH hash tables, we can efficiently estimate the
computational cost of LSH-based search for a given query regardless of the data
distribution. This means that we are able to choose the appropriate search
strategy between LSH-based search and linear search to achieve better
performance. Moreover, the integrated data structure is time efficient and fits
well with many recent state-of-the-art LSH-based approaches. Our experiments on

The relationship between severity of tumour, based on TNM staging, and survival
is still unclear for patients with TNM stage 2 and 3 tumours. We ask whether it
is possible to predict survival rate more accurately using a selection of
machine learning techniques applied to subsets of data to gain a deeper
understanding of the relationships between a patient's biochemical markers and
survival. We use a range of feature selection and single classification
techniques to predict the 5 year survival rate of TNM stage 2 and 3 patients
which initially produces less than ideal results. The performance of each model
individually is then compared with subsets of the data where agreement is
reached for multiple models. This novel method of selective ensembling
demonstrates that significant improvements in model accuracy on an unseen test
set can be achieved for patients where agreement between models is achieved.
Finally we point at a possible method to identify whether a patients prognosis
can be accurately predicted or not.

question in astrophysics. It is generally believed that matter is absorbed into
black holes via accretion disks, the state of which depends primarily on the
mass-accretion rate. When this rate approaches the critical rate (the Eddington
limit), thermal instability is supposed to occur in the inner disc, causing
repetitive patterns of large-amplitude X-ray variability (oscillations) on
timescales of minutes to hours. In fact, such oscillations have been observed
only in sources with a high mass accretion rate, such as GRS 1915+105. These
large-amplitude, relatively slow timescale, phenomena are thought to have
physical origins distinct from X-ray or optical variations with small
amplitudes and fast ($\lesssim$10 sec) timescales often observed in other black
hole binaries (e.g., XTE J1118+480 and GX 339-4). Here we report an extensive
multi-colour optical photometric data set of V404 Cygni, an X-ray transient
source containing a black hole of nine solar masses (and a conpanion star) at a
distance of 2.4 kiloparsecs. Our data show that optical oscillations on
timescales of 100 seconds to 2.5 hours can occur at mass-accretion rates more
than ten times lower than previously thought. This suggests that the accretion
rate is not the critical parameter for inducing inner-disc instabilities.
Instead, we propose that a long orbital period is a key condition for these
large-amplitude oscillations, because the outer part of the large disc in
binaries with long orbital periods will have surface densities too low to
maintain sustained mass accretion to the inner part of the disc. The lack of
sustained accretion -- not the actual rate -- would then be the critical factor
causing large-amplitude oscillations in long-period systems.

information and have been recognised as potential sources for gaining new drug
safety knowledge. Unfortunately there are many complexities and underlying
issues when analysing longitudinal observational data. Due to these
complexities, existing methods for large-scale detection of negative side
effects using observational data all tend to have issues distinguishing between
association and causality. New methods that can better discriminate causal and
non-causal relationships need to be developed to fully utilise the data. In
this paper we propose using a set of causality considerations developed by the
epidemiologist Bradford Hill as a basis for engineering features that enable
the application of supervised learning for the problem of detecting negative
side effects. The Bradford Hill considerations look at various perspectives of
a drug and outcome relationship to determine whether it shows causal traits. We
taught a classifier to find patterns within these perspectives and it learned
to discriminate between association and causality. The novelty of this research
is the combination of supervised learning and Bradford Hill's causality
considerations to automate the Bradford Hill's causality assessment. We
evaluated the framework on a drug safety gold standard know as the
observational medical outcomes partnership's nonspecified association reference
set. The methodology obtained excellent discriminate ability with area under
the curves ranging between 0.792-0.940 (existing method optimal: 0.73) and a
mean average precision of 0.640 (existing method optimal: 0.141). The proposed
features can be calculated efficiently and be readily updated, making the
framework suitable for big observational data.

transfer excitation, enhances the superconducting phase rigidity in
La_{1.885}Ba_{0.115}CuO_4 (LBCO). Time-Resolved Resonant Soft X-Ray Diffraction
demonstrates that charge order melting is prompt following near-infrared
photoexcitation whereas the crystal structure remains intact for moderate
fluences. THz time-domain spectroscopy reveals that, for the first 2 ps
following photoexcitation, a new Josephson Plasma Resonance edge, at higher
frequency with respect to the equilibrium edge, is induced indicating enhanced
superconducting interlayer coupling. The fluence dependence of the charge-order
melting and the enhanced superconducting interlayer coupling are correlated
with a saturation limit of about 0.5 mJ/cm2. Using a combination of x-ray and
optical spectroscopies we establish a hierarchy of timescales between enhanced
superconductivity, melting of charge order and rearrangement of the crystal
structure.

representation learning. Real-valued representation learning methods aim to
learn real-valued common representations for different modalities of data. To
speed up the cross-modal retrieval, a number of binary representation learning

takes into account the nuclear evolution of high-mass donors close to the

braking paradigm, we confirm many of the general features associated with the
observed CV population and find enormous diversity in their secular properties.
We predict that nearly half of the non-magnetic CVs with Porb > 6 hours are at
least mildly evolved (i.e., greater than one-half of their MS turn-off age).
  Some of these systems contribute to the observed population of PDCVs in the
period gap. We also see an enhancement by up to a factor of two in the
probability of detecting CVs at the `minimum period'. This spike is quite
narrow (approximately 5 minutes) and is attenuated because of the spectrum of
WD masses and partly by the evolution of the donors. Our syntheses imply that
there should be a very rapid decline in the number of ultracompact CVs (such as
AM CVns). We find that between 0.05 to 1 percent of PDCVs could be UCs, and
thus it is likely that the CV channel is probably not the primary contributor
to the intrinsic population of UCs (especially for Porb < 30 minutes). Finally,
a preliminary analysis of our results suggests that WDs in PDCVs experience a
net gain in mass of less than about 0.1 Msun as a result of high mass-transfer
rates early in their evolution.

for social behavior analysis in an intelligent visual human monitoring system.
Third, a social interaction is induced by a social behavior between two
persons, one person and one group, or two groups, hence three general scenarios
of social interactions are outlined for future theoretical development. The
proposed human monitoring system enables the generation of valuable quantified
information of social interactions. It provides an objective approach to

to better constrain the continuum optical depth and other physical conditions
of the molecular gas and dust. We have also detected H2O+ emission in three
sources. A tight correlation between $L_{\rm{H_2O}}$ and $L_{\rm{H_2O^+}}$ has
been found in galaxies from low to high redshift. The velocity-integrated flux

survival probability and in the critical size problem, i.e., the minimum patch
size required for surviving in the long time dynamics. We propose a measure for
the critical patch size as being proportional to the participation ratio (PR)
of the eigenvector corresponding to the largest eigenvalue of the linearized
Fisher dynamics. We obtain the (extinction-survival) phase diagram and the
probability distribution function (PDF) of the critical patch sizes for two
topologies, namely, the one-dimensional system and the fractal Peano basin. We
show that both topologies share the same qualitative features, but the fractal
topology requires higher spatial fluctuations to guarantee species survival. We
perform a finite-size scaling and we obtain the associated scaling exponents.
In addition, we show that the PDF of the critical patch sizes has an universal
shape for the 1D case in terms of the model parameters (diffusion, growth rate,

allows acquiring much smaller amount of data, still estimating the spectra of
frequency-sparse signals accurately. However, compressed sensing usually
requires random sampling in data acquisition, which is difficult to implement
in hardware. In this paper, we propose a deterministic and simple sampling
scheme, that is, sampling at three sub-Nyquist rates which have coprime
undersampled ratios. This sampling method turns out to be valid through
numerical experiments. A complex-valued multitask algorithm based on
variational Bayesian inference is proposed to estimate the spectra of
frequency-sparse signals after sampling. Simulations show that this method is
feasible and robust at quite low sampling rates.

would like to be able to represent the same physical system in terms of a few
""coarse""' quantum numbers, while the effective dynamics at the coarse level
should agree with the one induced by a description involving many small quantum
numbers. Efforts to understand this relationship face the problem of the
enormous computational complexity involved in evolving a generic state
containing many quanta. In a cosmological context however, certain symmetry
assumptions on the quantum states allow to simplify the problem. In this paper,
we will show how quantum states describing a spatially flat homogeneous and
isotropic universe can be refined and coarse grained. Invariance of the
dynamics of the coarse observables is shown to require a certain scaling
property (familiar from loop quantum cosmology) of the quantum states if no
running of parameters is taken into account. The involved states are solutions
to the Hamiltonian constraint when terms coming from spatial derivatives are
neglected, i.e. one works in the approximation of non-interacting FRW patches.
The technical means to arrive at this result are a version of loop quantum
gravity based on variables inspired by loop quantum cosmology, as well as an
exact solution to the quantum dynamics of loop quantum cosmology which extends
to the full theory in the chosen approximation.

engagement during two attention based tasks. The tasks required participants to
watch a tutorial video on introductory programming and to attend to a simple
maze game whilst wearing an electroencephalogram (EEG)device called the Emotiv
EPOC. The EPOC's proprietary software includes a system which tracks emotional
state (specifically: engagement, excitement, meditation, frustration, valence
and long-term excitement). Using this data, a software application written in
the Processing language was developed to track user's engagement levels and
implement a neurofeedback based intervention when engagement fell below an
acceptable level. The aim of the intervention was to prompt learners who
disengaged with the task to re-engage. The intervention used during the video
tutorial was to pause the video if a participant disengaged significantly.
However other interventions such as slowing the video down, playing a noise or
darkening/brightening the screen could also be used. For the maze game, the
caterpillar moving through the maze slowed in line with disengagement and moved
more quickly once the learner re-engaged. The approach worked very well and
successfully re-engaged participants, although a number of improvements could
be made. A number of interesting findings on the comparative engagement levels
of different groups e.g. by gender and by age etc. were identified and provide
useful pointers for future research studies.

the direction of V404 Cyg (within the $95\%$ confidence region and a chance

state. At variance with other Low Mass X-ray binaries, this active state
reaches luminosities of only ~$10^{34}$ erg s$^{-1}$, showing strong, fast

sporadic flares occur in excess of ~$10^{34}$ erg s$^{-1}$, with no pulsation

major new challenge, compared to the earlier results by one of us under time

equation. For acoustic waves in a fluid with fluctuations of both density and
compressibility (as well as for electromagnetic waves in a medium with
fluctuation of both permittivity and permeability) the random potential entails
a scalar and an operator contribution. For simplicity, the latter is usually
overlooked in multiple scattering theory: whatever the type of waves, this
simplification amounts to considering the Helmholtz equation with a sound speed
$c$ depending on position $\mathbf{r}$. In this work, a radiative transfer
equation is derived from the wave equation, in order to study energy transport
through a multiple scattering medium. In particular, the influence of the
operator term on various transport parameters is studied, based on the
diagrammatic approach of multiple scattering. Analytical results are obtained
for fundamental quantities of transport theory such as the transport mean-free
path $\ell^*$, scattering phase function $f$ and anisotropy factor $g$.
Discarding the operator term in the wave equation is shown to have a
significant impact on $f$ and $g$, yet limited to the low-frequency regime
i.e., when the correlation length of the disorder $\ell_c$ is smaller than or
comparable to the wavelength $\lambda$. More surprisingly, discarding the
operator part has a significant impact on the transport mean-free path $\ell^*$
whatever the frequency regime. When the scalar and operator terms have
identical amplitudes, the discrepancy on the transport mean-free path is around
$300\,\%$ in the low-frequency regime, and still above $30\,\%$ for
$\ell_c/\lambda=10^3$ no matter how weak fluctuations of the disorder are.
Analytical results are supported by numerical simulations of the wave equation
and Monte Carlo simulations.

problem for the development of intelligent human-computer interaction systems.
Still, it is a challenging problem that involves capturing high-dimensional
spatio-temporal patterns describing the variation of one's appearance over
time. Such representation undergoes great variability of the facial morphology
and environmental factors as well as head pose variations. In this paper, we
use Conditional Random Forests to capture low-level expression transition
patterns. More specifically, heterogeneous derivative features (e.g. feature
point movements or texture variations) are evaluated upon pairs of images. When
testing on a video frame, pairs are created between this current frame and
previous ones and predictions for each previous frame are used to draw trees
from Pairwise Conditional Random Forests (PCRF) whose pairwise outputs are
averaged over time to produce robust estimates. Moreover, PCRF collections can
also be conditioned on head pose estimation for multi-view dynamic FER. As
such, our approach appears as a natural extension of Random Forests for
learning spatio-temporal patterns, potentially from multiple viewpoints.
Experiments on popular datasets show that our method leads to significant
improvements over standard Random Forests as well as state-of-the-art
approaches on several scenarios, including a novel multi-view video corpus

describes the evolution of network synchrony. A bifurcation analysis is used to
uncover the primary mechanism for generating oscillations at the single and two

physical layer attacks to network layer attacks. In this paper, a novel
anti-jamming strategy for OFDM-based IoT systems is proposed which enables an
IoT controller to protect the IoT devices against a malicious radio jammer. The
interaction between the controller node and the jammer is modeled as a Colonel
Blotto game with continuous and asymmetric resources in which the IoT
controller, acting as defender, seeks to thwart the jamming attack by
distributing its power among the subcarries in a smart way to decrease the
aggregate bit error rate (BER) caused by the jammer. The jammer, on the other
hand, aims at disrupting the system performance by allocating jamming power to
different frequency bands. To solve the game, an evolutionary algorithm is
proposed which can find a mixed-strategy Nash equilibrium of the Blotto game.
Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm enables the IoT controller
to maintain the BER above an acceptable threshold, thereby preserving the IoT
network performance in the presence of malicious jamming.

of singular continuous measures, in the sense that $\mu$ cannot admit an
exponential frame if it has components of different dimensions. We prove that
this is not the case by showing that the sum of an arc length measure and a
surface measure can have a frame of exponentials. On the other hand we prove
that a measure of this form cannot have a frame of exponentials if the surface
has a point of non-zero Gaussian curvature. This is in spite of the fact that
each ""pure"" component of the measure separately may admit such a frame.

huge opportunities to host virtual resource at low cost without the need of

mostly comprise heterogeneous commodity servers hosting multiple virtual

usages, which may cause imbalanced resource utilization within servers that may
lead to performance degradation and service level agreements (SLAs) violations.
To achieve efficient scheduling, these challenges should be addressed and

hierarchical clustering using a 1-parameter family of homology groups to
quantify connectivity in all dimensions. The connectivity is compactly
described by the persistence diagram. One limitation of the current framework
is the reliance on metric distances, whereas in many practical applications
objects are compared by non-metric dissimilarity measures. Examples are the
Kullback-Leibler divergence, which is commonly used for comparing text and
images, and the Itakura-Saito divergence, popular for speech and sound. These
are two members of the broad family of dissimilarities called Bregman
divergences.
  We show that the framework of topological data analysis can be extended to
general Bregman divergences, widening the scope of possible applications. In
particular, we prove that appropriately generalized Cech and Delaunay (alpha)
complexes capture the correct homotopy type, namely that of the corresponding
union of Bregman balls. Consequently, their filtrations give the correct
persistence diagram, namely the one generated by the uniformly growing Bregman
balls. Moreover, we show that unlike the metric setting, the filtration of
Vietoris-Rips complexes may fail to approximate the persistence diagram. We
propose algorithms to compute the thus generalized Cech, Vietoris-Rips and
Delaunay complexes and experimentally test their efficiency. Lastly, we explain
their surprisingly good performance by making a connection with discrete Morse

by Dyson's proposal on the possible connection between the Riemann hypothesis
and a suitably defined quasicrystal. Our analysis is based on Kohn's
many-particle localization tensor defined within the modern theory of the
insulating state. In the Fibonacci quasicrystal, where all single-particle
eigenstates are critical (i.e., intermediate between ergodic and localized),
the noninteracting electron gas is found to be a conductor at most electron
densities, including the half-filled case; however, at various specific
fillings $\rho$, including the values $\rho = 1/g^n$, where $g$ is the golden
ratio and $n$ is any integer, the gas turns into an insulator due to spectral
gaps. Metallic behaviour is found at half-filling in the Riemann lattice as
well; however, in contrast to the Fibonacci quasicrystal, the Riemann lattice
is generically an insulator due to single-particle eigenstate localization,
likely at all other fillings. Its behaviour turns out to be alike that of the
off-diagonal Anderson model, albeit with different system-size scaling of the
band-centre anomalies. The advantages of analysing the Kohn's localization

soon provide the first direct detection of this era. This signal is influenced
by many astrophysical effects, including long range X-ray heating of the
intergalactic gas. During the preceding Cosmic Dawn era the impact of this
heating on the 21-cm signal is particularly prominent, especially before spin
temperature saturation. We present the largest-volume (349\,Mpc
comoving=244~$h^{-1}$Mpc) full numerical radiative transfer simulations to date
of this epoch that include the effects of helium and multi-frequency heating,
both with and without X-ray sources. We show that X-ray sources contribute
significantly to early heating of the neutral intergalactic medium and, hence,
to the corresponding 21-cm signal. The inclusion of hard, energetic radiation
yields an earlier, extended transition from absorption to emission compared to
the stellar-only case. The presence of X-ray sources decreases the absolute
value of the mean 21-cm differential brightness temperature. These hard sources
also significantly increase the 21-cm fluctuations compared the common
assumption of temperature saturation. The 21-cm differential brightness
temperature power spectrum is initially boosted on large scales, before
decreasing on all scales. Compared to the case of the cold, unheated
intergalactic medium, the signal has lower rms fluctuations and increased
non-Gaussianity, as measured by the skewness and kurtosis of the 21-cm
probability distribution functions. Images of the 21-cm signal with resolution
around 11~arcmin still show fluctuations well above the expected noise for deep
integrations with the SKA1-Low, indicating that direct imaging of the X-ray

represent the history of species that have undergone reticulate events such as
horizontal gene transfer, hybrid speciation and recombination. One of the most
fundamental questions that arise in this context is whether the evolution of a
gene with one copy in all species can be explained by a given network. In
mathematical terms, this is often translated in the following way: is a given
phylogenetic tree contained in a given phylogenetic network? Recently this tree
containment problem has been widely investigated from a computational
perspective, but most studies have only focused on the topology of the phylo-
genies, ignoring a piece of information that, in the case of phylogenetic
trees, is routinely inferred by evolutionary analyses: branch lengths. These
measure the amount of change (e.g., nucleotide substitutions) that has occurred
along each branch of the phylogeny. Here, we study a number of versions of the
tree containment problem that explicitly account for branch lengths. We show
that, although length information has the potential to locate more precisely a
tree within a network, the problem is computationally hard in its most general
form. On a positive note, for a number of special cases of biological
relevance, we provide algorithms that solve this problem efficiently. This
includes the case of networks of limited complexity, for which it is possible
to recover, among the trees contained by the network with the same topology as
the input tree, the closest one in terms of branch lengths.

Coronal Mass Ejection (CME), covering the source region on the Sun from SDO,
stereoscopic imaging observations from STEREO, magnetic field characteristics
at MESSENGER, and type II radio burst and in situ measurements from Wind. A
triangulation method based on STEREO stereoscopic observations is employed to
determine the kinematics of the CME, and the outcome is compared with the
result derived from the type II radio burst with a solar wind electron density
model. A Grad-Shafranov technique is applied to Wind in situ data to
reconstruct the flux-rope structure and compare it with the observation of the
solar source region, which helps understand the geo-effectiveness associated
with the CME structure. Conclusions are as follows: (1) the CME undergoes an
impulsive acceleration, a rapid deceleration before reaching MESSENGER, and
then a gradual deceleration out to 1 AU, which should be noticed in CME
kinematics models; (2) the type II radio burst was probably produced from a
high-density interaction region between the CME-driven shock and a nearby
streamer or from the shock flank with lower heights, which implies
uncertainties in the determination of CME kinematics using solely type II radio
bursts; (3) the flux-rope orientation and chirality deduced from in situ
reconstruction at Wind agree with those obtained from solar source
observations; (4) the prolonged southward magnetic field near the Earth is
mainly from the axial component of the largely southward inclined flux rope,
which indicates the importance of predicting both the flux-rope orientation and
magnetic field components in geomagnetic activity forecasting.

challenging task as it involves handling large interpersonal morphological

labelling expressions is a time-consuming process that is prone to
subjectivity, thus the variability may not be fully covered by the training
data. In this work, we propose to train Random Forests upon spatially defined
local subspaces of the face. The output local predictions form a categorical
expression-driven high-level representation that we call Local Expression

expressions as well as Action Units (AUs). Furthermore, LEPs can be weighted by
confidence scores provided by an autoencoder network. Such network is trained
to locally capture the manifold of the non-occluded training data in a

dissimilarities between them - and transformation - when dissimilarities are
reduced, the network may become more clustered but not less. Two particular

upper and lower bounds in the space of admissible methods. Furthermore,
alternative clustering methodologies and axioms are considered. In particular,
modifying the axiom of value such that clustering in two-node networks occurs

correlated disorder in the interatomic interaction strengths. In a simple
approach, the dynamics in the many-body Hilbert space can be understood in
terms of a one-dimensional Anderson-like model with disorder on every other

on an eight-atom chain and observe a clear suppression of excitation transfer.
Our experiment accesses a regime which is described by a two-dimensional
Anderson model on a ""trimmed"" square lattice. Our results thus provide a
concrete example in which the absence of excitation propagation in a many-body

luminosity-dependent density evolution (LDDE). Using a Kolmogorov-Smirnov test
on one-parameter cumulative distributions (in luminosity, redshift, photon
index and source count), we confirm the results of earlier works showing that
these data somewhat favour LDDE over PLE; we show that this is the case for
both $\Lambda$CDM and $R_{\rm h}=ct$. Regardless of which GLF one chooses,
however, we also show that model selection tools very strongly favour $R_{\rm

featuring a strong evolution in redshift, may nonetheless be used as a valuable
independent check of other model comparisons based solely on geometric
considerations.

Lagrangian points as observables, in order to test general relativity and
effective field theories of gravity in the solar system. However, since the
three-body problem of classical celestial mechanics is just an approximation of
a much more complicated setting, where all celestial bodies in the solar system
are subject to their mutual gravitational interactions, while solar radiation
pressure and other sources of nongravitational perturbations also affect the
dynamics, it is conceptually desirable to improve the current understanding of
solar system dynamics in general relativity, as a first step towards a more
accurate theoretical study of orbital motion in the weak-gravity regime. For
this purpose, starting from the Einstein equations in the de Donder-Lanczos
gauge, this paper arrives first at the Levi-Civita Lagrangian for the geodesic
motion of celestial bodies, showing in detail under which conditions the
effects of internal structure and finite extension get cancelled in general
relativity to first post-Newtonian order. The resulting nonlinear ordinary
differential equations for the motion of planets and satellites are solved for
the Earth's orbit about the Sun, written down in detail for the Sun-Earth-Moon
system, and investigated for the case of planar motion of a body immersed in
the gravitational field produced by the other bodies (e.g. planets with their
satellites). At this stage, we prove an exact property, according to which the
fourth-order time derivative of the original system leads to a linear system of
ordinary differential equations. This opens an interesting perspective on
forthcoming research on planetary motions in general relativity within the
solar system, although the resulting equations remain a challenge for numerical
and qualitative studies.

sufficiently large self-interactions suppress the exponential growth phase,

  using a Bayesian Hierarchical state space model",,,,,"stat.AP","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Indirect information on population size, like pellet counts or volunteer
counts, is the main source of information in most ecological studies and
applied population management situations. Often, such observations are treaded
as if they were actual measurements of population size. This assumption results
in incorrect conclusions about a population's size and its dynamics. We propose
a model with a temporal varying link, denoted countability, between indirect
observations and actual population size. We show that, when indirect
measurement has high precision (for instance many observation hours) the
assumption of temporal varying countability can have a crucial effect on the
estimated population dynamic. We apply the model on two local moose populations
in Sweden. The estimated population dynamics is found to explain 30-50 percent
of the total variability in the observation data; thus, countability accounts
for most of the variation. This unreliability of the estimated dynamics has a
substantial negative impact on the ability to manage populations; for example,
reducing (increasing) the number of animals that needs to be harvested in order
to sustain the population above (below) a fixed level. Finally, large
difference in countability between two study areas implies a substantial
spatial variation in the countability; this variation in itself is highly
worthy of study.

observed at multiple aspect angles has been the preferred approach for
determining the three-dimensional (3D) electron density structure of the solar
corona. However, it is seriously hampered by the restrictive assumption that
the corona is time-invariant which introduces significant errors in the
reconstruction. We first explore several methods to mitigate the temporal
variation of the corona by decoupling the ""fast-varying"" inner corona from the
""slow-moving"" outer corona using multiple masking (either by juxtaposition or
recursive combination) and radial weighting. Weighting with a radial
exponential profile provides some improvement over a classical reconstruction
but only beyond 3 Rsun. We next consider a full time-dependent tomographic
reconstruction involving spatio-temporal regularization and further introduce a
co-rotating regularization aimed at preventing concentration of reconstructed
density in the plane of the sky. Crucial to testing our procedure and properly
tuning the regularization parameters is the introduction of a time-dependent
MHD model of the corona based on observed magnetograms to build a time-series
of synthetic images of the corona. Our procedure, which successfully reproduces
the time-varying model corona, is finally applied to a set of of 53 LASCO-C2 pB
images roughly evenly spaced in time from 15 to 29 March 2009. Our procedure
paves the way to a time-dependent tomographic reconstruction of the coronal
electron density to the whole set of LASCO-C2 images presently spanning 20
years.

symbiotic binary MWC 560 has gone into a new and even brighter outburst. We
present our tight BVRI photometric monitoring of MWC 560 (451 independent runs
distributed over 357 different nights), covering the 2005-2016 interval, and
the current outburst in particoular. A stricking feature of the 2016 outburst
has been the suppression of the short term chaotic variability during the rise
toward maximum brightness, and its dominance afterward with an amplitude in
excess of 0.5 mag. Similar to the 1990 event when the object remained around
maximum brightness for ~6 months, at the time Solar conjunction prevented
further observations of the current outburst, MWC 560 was still around maximum,
three months past reaching it. We place our observations into a long term
contex by combining with literature data to provide a complete 1928-2016
lightcurve. Some strong periodicities are found to modulate the optical
photometry of MWC 560. A period of 1860 days regulate the occourence of bright
phases at BVR bands (with exactly 5.0 cycles separating the 1990 and 2016
outbursts), while the peak brightness attained during bright phases seems to
vary with a ~9570 days cycle. A clean 331 day periodicity modulate the I-band
lightcurve, where the emission from the M giant dominates, with a lightcurve
strongly reminiscent of an ellipsoidal distortion plus irradiation from the hot
companion. Pros and cons of 1860 and 331 days as the system orbital period are
reviewed, waiting for a spectroscopic radial velocity orbit of the M giant to
settle the question (provided the orbit is not oriented face-on).

be successful in both motion trajectory segmentation and multi-target tracking

mostly high-level information for multi-target tracking. In this paper we argue
that point trajectories and their local relationships can contribute to the
high-level task of multi-target tracking and also argue that high-level cues
from object detection and tracking are helpful to solve motion segmentation. We
propose a joint graphical model for point trajectories and object detections
whose Multicuts are solutions to motion segmentation {\it and} multi-target

generated by different admissible methods. The convex combination family
combines admissible methods through a convex operation in the space of

related by strong cyclic influences in the network. Algorithms for the
computation of hierarchical clusters generated by reciprocal and nonreciprocal
clustering as well as the grafting, convex combination, and semi-reciprocal

centered on $A$(C)$=7.96$ (the high-C region) and $A$(C)$ =6.28$ (the low-C

clearly different locations in the $A$(Na)-$A$(C) and $A$(Mg)-$A$(C) spaces,

the CEMP-$s$ (and CEMP-$r/s$) stars and the CEMP-no stars appears to be $as\

also explored by varying the fraction of homoatomic and heteroatomic

one hand, and the form of the phonon dispersion curves from primitive to
face-centered cubic type, on the other hand, is observed as homoatomic
neighbours are disfavoured. The implications for rationalising selection rule

(possibly asymmetric) network data: excisiveness and linear scale preservation.
The latter enforces imperviousness to change in units of measure whereas the
former ensures local consistency of the clustering outcome. Algorithmically,
excisiveness implies that we can reduce computational complexity by only
clustering a data subset of interest while theoretically guaranteeing that the
same hierarchical outcome would be observed when clustering the whole dataset.
Moreover, we introduce the concept of representability, i.e. a generative model
for describing clustering methods through the specification of their action on
a collection of networks. We further show that, within a rich set of admissible
methods, requiring representability is equivalent to requiring both
excisiveness and linear scale preservation. Leveraging this equivalence, we
show that all excisive and linear scale preserving methods can be factored into
two steps: a transformation of the weights in the input network followed by the
application of a canonical clustering method. Furthermore, their factorization
can be used to show stability of excisive and linear scale preserving methods
in the sense that a bounded perturbation in the input network entails a bounded
perturbation in the clustering output.

two daily inactivity periods in the people's aggregated mobile phone calling

find that the nocturnal resting period is strongly influenced by the length of
daylight, and that its seasonal variation depends on the latitude, such that
for people living in two different cities separated by eight latitudinal
degrees, the difference in the resting period of people between the summer and
winter in southern cities is almost twice that in the northern cities. We also
observe that the duration of the afternoon resting period is influenced by the
temperature, and that there is a threshold from which this influence sets in.
Finally, we observe that the yearly dynamics of the afternoon and nocturnal
resting periods appear to be counterbalancing each other. This also lends

  Kashiwara Flag Scheme","This article is based on my Ph.D. thesis",,,,"math.RT math.AG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The relaxed highest weight representations introduced by Feigin et al. are a
special class of representations of the affine Kac-Moody algebra
$\hat{\mathfrak{sl}_2}$, which do not have a highest (or lowest) weight. We
formulate a generalization of this notion for an arbitrary affine Kac-Moody
algebra $\mathfrak{g}$. We then realize induced $\mathfrak{g}$-modules of this
type and their duals as global sections of twisted $\mathcal{D}$-modules on the
Kashiwara flag scheme $X$ associated to $\mathfrak{g}$. The
$\mathcal{D}$-modules that appear in our construction are direct images from
subschemes of $X$ that are intersections of finite dimensional Schubert cells
with their translate by a simple reflection. Besides the twist $\lambda$, they
depend on a complex number describing the monodromy of the local systems we
construct on these intersections. We describe the global sections of the
$*$-direct images as a module over the Cartan subalgebra of $\mathfrak{g}$ and
show that the higher cohomology vanishes. We obtain a complete description of
the cohomology groups of the direct images as $\mathfrak{g}$-modules in the
following two cases. First, we address the case when the intersection is
isomorphic to $\mathbb{C}^{\times}$. Secondly, we address the case of the
$*$-direct image from an arbitrary intersection when the twist is regular
antidominant and the monodromy is trivial. For the proof of this case we
introduce an exact auto-equivalence of the category of $\mathcal{D}$-modules
$\text{Hol}(\lambda)$ induced by the automorphism of $X$ defined by a lift of a
simple reflection. These results describe for the first time explicit
non-highest weight $\mathfrak{g}$-modules as global sections on the Kashiwara
flag scheme and extend several results of Kashiwara-Tanisaki to the case of
relaxed highest weight representations.

  4] -> f(fid)",,,,"cs.DB","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In this paper we describe VIG, a data scaler for benchmarks in the context of
ontology-based data access (OBDA). Data scaling is a relatively recent
approach, proposed in the database community, that allows for quickly scaling
up an input data instance to s times its size, while preserving certain
application-specific characteristics. The advantage of the approach is that the
user is not required to manually input the characteristics of the data to be
produced, making it particularly suitable for OBDA benchmarks, where the
complexity of database schemas might pose a challenge for manual input (e.g.,
the NPD benchmark contains 70 tables with some containing more than 60
columns). As opposed to a traditional data scaler, VIG includes domain
information provided by the OBDA mappings and the ontology in order to produce
data. VIG is currently used in the NPD benchmark, but it is not NPD-specific
and can be seeded with any data instance. The distinguishing features of VIG
are (1) its simple and clear generation strategy; (2) its efficiency, as each
value is generated in constant time, without accesses to the disk or to RAM to
retrieve previously generated values; (3) and its generality, as the data is
exported in CSV files that can be easily imported by any RDBMS system. VIG is a
java implementation licensed under Apache 2.0, and its source code is available
on GitHub (https://github.com/ontop/vig) in the form of a Maven project. The
code is being maintained since two years by the -ontop- team at the Free
University of Bozen-Bolzano.

$r>0$ such that each $g:X\to\mathbb{R}^n$ with $\|f-g\|_\infty\le r$ has a

worst-case optima in optimization problems in which the feasible domain is

  An important ingredient is an algorithm for deciding the topological
extension problem based on computing cohomological obstructions to
extendability and their persistence. We describe an explicit algorithm for the
primary and secondary obstruction, two stages of a sequence of algorithms with

Furthermore, the power scaling law and the asymptotic performance result by

of systems biology. These models increasingly involve large numbers of unknown
parameters, have complex structure which can result in substantial evaluation
time relative to the needs of the analysis, and need to be compared to observed
data. The correct analysis of such models usually requires a global parameter
search, over a high dimensional parameter space, that incorporates and respects
the most important sources of uncertainty. This can be an extremely difficult
task, but it is essential for any meaningful inference or prediction to be made
about any biological system. It hence represents a fundamental challenge for
the whole of systems biology.
  Results: Bayesian statistical methodology for the uncertainty analysis of
complex models is introduced, which is designed to address the high dimensional
global parameter search problem. Bayesian emulators that mimic the systems
biology model but which are extremely fast to evaluate are embedded within an
iterative history match: an efficient method to search high dimensional spaces
within a more formal statistical setting, while incorporating major sources of
uncertainty. The approach is demonstrated via application to two models of
hormonal crosstalk in Arabidopsis root development, which have 32 rate
parameters, for which we identify the sets of rate parameter values that lead
to acceptable matches to observed trend data. The biological consequences of
the resulting comparison, including the evaluation of gene functions, are
described.

  2016). Supervisor: Prof. Aurelio Uncini",,,,"stat.ML cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Distributed learning is the problem of inferring a function in the case where
training data is distributed among multiple geographically separated sources.
Particularly, the focus is on designing learning strategies with low
computational requirements, in which communication is restricted only to
neighboring agents, with no reliance on a centralized authority. In this
thesis, we analyze multiple distributed protocols for a large number of neural
network architectures. The first part of the thesis is devoted to a definition
of the problem, followed by an extensive overview of the state-of-the-art.
Next, we introduce different strategies for a relatively simple class of single
layer neural networks, where a linear output layer is preceded by a nonlinear
layer, whose weights are stochastically assigned in the beginning of the
learning process. We consider both batch and sequential learning, with
horizontally and vertically partitioned data. In the third part, we consider
instead the more complex problem of semi-supervised distributed learning, where
each agent is provided with an additional set of unlabeled training samples. We
propose two different algorithms based on diffusion processes for linear
support vector machines and kernel ridge regression. Subsequently, the fourth
part extends the discussion to learning with time-varying data (e.g.
time-series) using recurrent neural networks. We consider two different
families of networks, namely echo state networks (extending the algorithms
introduced in the second part), and spline adaptive filters. Overall, the
algorithms presented throughout the thesis cover a wide range of possible
practical applications, and lead the way to numerous future extensions, which
are briefly summarized in the conclusive chapter.

changes in lipid density and fluidity are believed to play an essential role in
membrane targeting and function. The dynamic structure of liquids on the
molecular scale can exhibit complex transient density fluctuations. Here the
lateral heterogeneity of lipid dynamics is explored in free standing lipid
monolayers. As the temperature is lowered the probes exhibit increasingly broad
and heterogeneous rotational correlation. This increase in heterogeneity
appears to exhibit a critical onset, similar to those observed for glass
forming fluids. We explore heterogeneous relaxation in in a single constituent
lipid monolayer of 1,2-dimyristoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DMPC) by
measuring the rotational diffusion of a fluorescent probe,
1-palmitoyl-2-[1]-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (NBD-PC), using wide-field
time-resolved fluorescence anisotropy (TRFA). The observed relaxation exhibits
a narrow, liquid-like distribution at high temperatures ({\tau} ~ 2.4 ns),
consistent with previous experimental measures [1, 2]. However, as the
temperature is quenched, the distribution broadens, and we observe the
appearance of a long relaxation population ({\tau} ~ 16.5 ns). This supports
the heterogeneity observed for lipids at high packing densities, and
demonstrates that the nanoscale diffusion and reorganization in lipid
structures can be significantly complex, even in the simplest amorphous
architectures. Dynamical heterogeneity of this form can have a significant
impact on the organization, permeability and energetics of lipid membrane
structures.

by instabilities in the disk or the star-disk connection. However, some
protostellar outbursts may not fit into this framework. In this paper, we
analyze optical and near-infrared spectra and photometry to characterize the
2015 outburst of the probable young star ASASSN-15qi. The $\sim 3.5$ mag
brightening in the $V$ band was sudden, with an unresolved rise time of less
than one day. The outburst decayed exponentially by 1 mag for 6 days and then
gradually back to the pre-outburst level after 200 days. The outburst is
dominated by emission from $\sim10,000$ K gas. An explosive release of energy
accelerated matter from the star in all directions, seen in a spectacular cool,
spherical wind with a maximum velocity of 1000 km/s. The wind and hot gas both
disappeared as the outburst faded and the source returned to its quiescent
F-star spectrum. Nebulosity near the star brightened with a delay of 10-20
days. Fluorescent excitation of H$_2$ is detected in emission from vibrational
levels as high as $v=11$, also with a possible time delay in flux increase. The
mid-infrared spectral energy distribution does not indicate the presence of
warm dust emission, although the optical photospheric absorption and CO
overtone emission could be related to a gaseous disk. Archival photometry
reveals a prior outburst in 1976. Although we speculate about possible causes
for this outburst, none of the explanations are compelling.

below the onset of glassy dynamics. This reduction in water activity could be
significant in crowded biological systems, contributing to global change in
protein energy landscape, resulting in a significant enhancement of protein
stability under environmental stress. We observed similar dynamic reduction for
two disaccharide osmolytes, sucrose and trehalose, with trehalose being the
more effective dynamic reducer.

leads to a non-conservative equation. We also show that the speed at which

accretion flows around black holes using a grid based finite difference method.
We do not use reflection symmetry on the equatorial plane in order to inspect
if the disk along with the centrifugal barrier oscillated vertically. In the
inviscid limit, we find that the CENtrifugal pressure supported BOundary Layer
(CENBOL) is oscillating vertically, more so, when the specific angular momentum
is higher. As a result, the rate of outflow produced from the CENBOL, also
oscillates. Indeed, the outflow rates in the upper half and the lower half are
found to be anti-correlated. We repeat the exercise for a series of specific
angular momentum {\lambda} of the flow in order to demonstrate effects of the
centrifugal force on this interesting behaviour. We find that, as predicted in
theoretical models of disks in vertical equilibrium, the CENBOL is produced
only when the centrifugal force is significant and more specifically, when
{\lambda} > 1.5. Outflow rate itself is found to increase with {\lambda} as
well and so is the oscillation amplitude. The cause of oscillation appears to
be due to the interaction among the back flow from the centrifugal barrier, the
outflowing winds and the inflow. For low angular momentum, the back flow as
well as the oscillation are missing. To our knowledge, this is the first time
that such an oscillating solution is found with an well-tested grid based
finite difference code and such a solution could be yet another reason of why
Quasi-Periodic Oscillations should be observed in black hole candidates which
are accreting low angular momentum transonic flows.

Theory (GFT) models in the context of the GFT quantum gravity condensate
analogue of the Gross-Pitaevskii equation for real Bose-Einstein condensates
including combinatorially local interaction terms. Thus we go beyond the
usually considered construction for free models.
  More precisely, considering such interactions in a weak regime, we find
solutions for which the expectation value of the number operator N is finite,
as in the free case. When tuning the interaction to the strongly nonlinear
regime, however, we obtain solutions for which N grows and eventually blows up,
which is reminiscent of what one observes for real Bose-Einstein condensates,
where a strong interaction regime can only be realized at high density. This
behaviour suggests the breakdown of the Bogoliubov ansatz for quantum gravity
condensates and the need for non-Fock representations to describe the system
when the condensate constituents are strongly correlated.
  Furthermore, we study the expectation values of certain geometric operators
imported from Loop Quantum Gravity in the free and interacting cases. In
particular, computing solutions around the nontrivial minima of the interaction
potentials, one finds, already in the weakly interacting case, a nonvanishing
condensate population for which the spectra are dominated by the lowest
nontrivial configuration of the quantum geometry. This result indicates that
the condensate may indeed consist of many smallest building blocks giving rise
to an effectively continuous geometry, thus suggesting the interpretation of
the condensate phase to correspond to a geometric phase.

half-wave plate (HWP) for study of the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB)
polarization by the POLARBEAR-2 (PB2) experiment. Rapid polarization modulation
suppresses 1/f noise due to unpolarized atmospheric turbulence and improves
sensitivity to degree-angular-scale CMB fluctuations where the inflationary
gravitational wave signal is thought to exist. A HWP modulator rotates the
input polarization signal and therefore allows a single polarimeter to measure
both linear polarization states, eliminating systematic errors associated with
differencing of orthogonal detectors. PB2 projects a 365-mm-diameter focal
plane of 7,588 dichroic, 95/150 GHz transition-edge-sensor bolometers onto a
4-degree field of view that scans the sky at $\sim$ 1 degree per second. We
find that a 500-mm-diameter ambient-temperature sapphire achromatic HWP
rotating at 2 Hz is a suitable polarization modulator for PB2. We present the
design considerations for the PB2 HWP, the construction of the HWP optical
stack and rotation mechanism, and the performance of the fully-assembled HWP
instrument. We conclude with a discussion of HWP polarization modulation for
future Simons Array receivers.

bifurcations may be induced in the randomly connected model by changing the
couplings or the connectivity and also the dilution (degree of asynchronism) of

principles underpin macroscopic quantum phenomena observed in high temperature
super conducting materials, room temperature coherence in photosynthetic
processes and the emergence of long range order in biological structures. These
systems are driven by dissipative systems, which lead to fractal assembly and a
fractal network of charges (with associated quantum potentials) at the
molecular scale. At critical levels of charge density and fractal dimension,
individual quantum potentials merge to form a charged induced macroscopic
quantum potential, which act as a structuring force dictating long range order.
Whilst the system is only partially coherent (i.e. only the bosonic fields are
coherent), within these processes many of the phenomena associated with
standard quantum theory are recovered, with macroscopic quantum potentials and
associated forces having their equivalence in standard quantum mechanics. We
establish a testable hypothesis that the development of structures analogous to
those found in biological systems, which exhibit macroscopic quantum
properties, should lead to increased critical temperatures in high temperature
superconducting materials. If the theory is confirmed it opens up a new,
systematic, ab initio approach to the structural development of these types of
materials.

to the remaining confidence in financial industry. Yet, despite an enormous
amount of popular literature on the subject, rigorous time-series studies are
few. In my paper, I discuss the following hypothesis. Namely, if we should
assume for a statistical null, the quotes, which were submitted by the member
banks were true, the deviations from the LIBOR should have been entirely random
because they were determined by idiosyncratic conditions by the member banks.
This hypothesis can be statistically verified. Serial correlations of the
rates, which cannot be explained by the differences in credit qualities of the
member banks or the domicile Governments, were subjected to correlation tests.
A new econometric method--the analysis of the Wigner-Ville function borrowed
from quantum mechanics and signal processing--is used and explained for the
statistical interpretation of regression residuals.
