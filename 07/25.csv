the convex-geometric nature of the 2-mixed volume remains unclear. On the other

of edges of a $k$-uniform $n$-vertex hypergraph $H$ which contains no copy of
$F$. Determining or estimating $\textrm{ex}(n,F)$ is a classical and central
problem in extremal combinatorics. While for $k=2$ this problem is well
understood, due to the work of Tur\'an and of Erd\H{o}s and Stone, only very
little is known for $k$-uniform hypergraphs for $k>2$. We focus on the case
when $F$ is a $k$-uniform hypergraph with three edges on $k+1$ vertices.
Already this very innocent (and maybe somewhat particular looking) problem is
still wide open even for $k=3$.
  We consider a variant of the problem where the large hypergraph $H$ enjoys
additional hereditary density conditions. Questions of this type were suggested
by Erd\H os and S\'os about 30 years ago. We show that every $k$-uniform
hypergraph $H$ with density $>2^{1-k}$ with respect to every large collections
of $k$-cliques induced by sets of $(k-2)$-tuples contains a copy of $F$. The
required density $2^{1-k}$ is best possible as higher order tournament
constructions show.
  Our result can be viewed as a common generalisation of the first extremal
result in graph theory due to Mantel (when $k=2$ and the hereditary density
condition reduces to a normal density condition) and a recent result of Glebov,
Kr\'al', and Volec (when $k=3$ and large subsets of vertices of $H$ induce a
subhypergraph of density $>1/4$). Our proof for arbitrary $k\geq 2$ utilises
the regularity method for hypergraphs.

length, rooted at r, spanning a given subset T of vertices, and such that, for
each e in E, there are at most c(e) paths, linking r to vertices in T, that

set is identified by using the conditional partial spectral coherence. Thereby,
nodes are related to the components of a multivariate spatial point process and
edges express orthogonality relation between the single components. This paper
introduces an efficient approach towards pattern analysis of highly structured

new model permits the simultaneous analysis of all multivariate conditional

in a training procedure that is much closer to the test phase, and allows us to

branches are disconnected from the central lane and have a Y shape with a
bright grain toward the umbra. The images reveal that light bridges exist on
varying intensity levels and that their small-scale features evolve on
timescales of minutes. Faint light bridges show dark lanes outlined by the
surrounding bright features. Dark lanes are very common and are also found in
the boundary of pores. They have a characteristic width of 0.1"" or smaller.
Intergranular dark lanes of that width are seen in active region granulation.
While central dark lanes in thin light bridges are elevated and associated with
an density increase above upflows, the dark lane branches correspond to
locations of downflows and are depressed relative to the adjacent bright
plasma. Thick light bridges with central dark lanes show no projection effect.
They have a flat elevated plateau that falls off steeply at the umbral
boundary. There, Y-shaped filaments form as they do in the inner penumbra. This
indicates the presence of inclined magnetic fields, meaning that the umbral
magnetic field is wrapped around the convective light bridge.

statistical mechanics. Many of such cases can be satisfactorily handled by
introducing nonadditive entropic functionals, such as $S_q\equiv
k\frac{1-\sum_{i=1}^W p_i^q}{q-1} \; \Bigl(q \in {\cal R}; \, \sum_{i=1}^W

of such systems can be characterized by a set of values $\{q\}$, directly
corresponding to its various physical/dynamical/geometrical properties. A most
important subset is usually referred to as the $q$-triplet, namely
$(q_{sensitivity}, q_{relaxation}, q_{stationary\,state})$, defined in the body
of this paper. In the BG limit we have
$q_{sensitivity}=q_{relaxation}=q_{stationary\,state}=1$. For a given class of
complex systems, the set $\{q\}$ contains only a few independent values of $q$,
all the others being functions of those few. An illustration of this structure

still is an open question. This is so, for instance, for the challenging
$q$-triplet associated with the edge of chaos of the logistic map. We introduce
here a transformation which sensibly generalizes the TGS one, and which might
constitute an important step towards the general solution.

basis for identifying the families of risk functions that should be used in
risk averse optimization problems. Despite its theoretical appeal, the
implementation of a convex risk function remains difficult, as there is little
guidance regarding how a convex risk function should be chosen so that it also
well represents one's own risk preferences. In this paper, we address this
issue through the lens of inverse optimization. Specifically, given solution
data from some (forward) risk-averse optimization problems we develop an
inverse optimization framework that generates a risk function that renders the
solutions optimal for the forward problems. The framework incorporates the
well-known properties of convex risk functions, namely, monotonicity,
convexity, translation invariance, and law invariance, as the general
information about candidate risk functions, and also the feedbacks from
individuals, which include an initial estimate of the risk function and
pairwise comparisons among random losses, as the more specific information. Our
framework is particularly novel in that unlike classical inverse optimization,
no parametric assumption is made about the risk function, i.e. it is
non-parametric. We show how the resulting inverse optimization problems can be
reformulated as convex programs and are polynomially solvable if the
corresponding forward problems are polynomially solvable. We illustrate the
imputed risk functions in a portfolio selection problem and demonstrate their
practical value using real-life data.

characterize vacancy-mediated diffusion of cations in Gd$_2$Ti$_2$O$_7$

that cation vacancy diffusion is slow in materials with low levels of disorder.
However, higher levels of disorder allow for fast cation diffusion, which is
then also accompanied by fast antisite annihilation and ordering of the
cations. The cation diffusivity is therefore not constant, but decreases as the
material reorders. The results suggest that fast cation diffusion is triggered
by the existence of a percolation network of antisites. This is in marked
contrast with oxygen diffusion, which showed a smooth increase of the ionic
diffusivity with increasing disorder in the same compound. The increase of the
cation diffusivity with disorder is also contrary to observations from other
complex oxides and disordered media models, suggesting a fundamentally
different relation between disorder and mass transport. These results highlight
the dynamic interplay between fast cation diffusion and the recovery of
disorder and have important implications for understanding radiation damage

homogeneous goods to $n$ unit-demand buyers who arrive sequentially with
independent and identically distributed valuations. In this setting the optimal
posted prices are dynamic in the sense that they depend on the remaining
numbers of goods and buyers. We investigate how much revenue is lost when a
single static price is used instead for all buyers and goods, and prove upper
bounds on the ratio between the maximum revenue from dynamic prices and that
from static prices. These bounds are tight for all values of $k$ and $n$ and
vary depending on a regularity property of the underlying distribution. For
general distributions we obtain a ratio of $2-k/n$, for regular distributions a
ratio that increases in $n$ and is bounded from above by $1/(1-k^k/(e^{k}k!))$,
which is roughly $1/(1-1/(\sqrt{2\pi k}))$. The lower bounds hold for the
revenue gap between dynamic and static prices. The upper bounds are obtained
via an ex-ante relaxation of the revenue maximization problem, as a consequence
the tight bounds of $2-k/n$ in the general case and of $1/(1-1/(\sqrt{2\pi
k}))$ in the regular case apply also to the potentially larger revenue gap
between the optimal incentive-compatible mechanism and the optimal static
price. Our results imply that for regular distributions the benefit of dynamic
prices vanishes while for non-regular distributions dynamic prices may achieve
up to twice the revenue of static prices.

collective mode in deformed nuclei. The collectivity depends on the details of
the shell structure around the Fermi levels, in particular the presence of the
orbitals that have the enhanced transition matrix elements of the non-axial
quadrupole excitation. Quite recently, a sudden decrease in the excitation
energy of the $\gamma$ vibration was observed at RIKEN RIBF for the
neutron-rich Dy isotopes at $N=106$. Purpose: In the present work, by studying
systematically the microscopic structure of the $\gamma$ vibration in the
neutron-rich Dy isotopes with $N=98-114$, we try to understand the mechanism of
the observed softening. Methods: The low-frequency modes of excitation in the
neutron-rich rare-earth nuclei are described based on nuclear
density-functional theory. We employ the Skyrme energy-density functionals
(EDF) in the Hartree-Fock-Bogoliubov calculation for the ground states and in
the Quasiparticle Random-Phase Approximation (QRPA) for the excitations.
Results: The lowering of the excitation energy around $N=106$ is reproduced
well by employing the SkM* and SLy4 functionals. We find the similar isotopic
dependence of the excitation energy in the neutron-rich Er and Yb isotopes as
well. Conclusions: The microscopic framework of the Skyrme-EDF based QRPA
describes well the isotopic dependence of the energy of the $\gamma$ vibration
in the well-deformed neutron-rich rare-earth nuclei. The strong collectivity at
$N=108-110$ is expected as the Fermi level of neutrons lies just among the
orbitals that play an important role in generating the collectivity around
$N=106$.

accuracy in measuring the NS mass ($M_{ns}$) for the GWs from BH-NS binaries
adopting the Advanced LIGO sensitivity with a signal-to-noise ratio of 10. By
using the Fisher matrix method, we calculate the measurement errors ($\sigma$)
in $M_{ns}$ assuming the NS mass of $1 \leq M_{ns}/M_{\odot} \leq 2$ and low
mass BHs with the range of $4 \leq M_{bh}/M_{\odot} \leq 10$. We used the
TaylorF2 waveform model where the spins are aligned with the orbital angular
momentum, but here we only consider the BH spins. We find that the fractional
errors ($\sigma/M_{ns} \times 100$) are in the range of $10\% - 50\%$ in our
mass region for a given dimensionless BH spin as $\chi_{bh} = 0$. The errors
tend to increase as the BH spin increases, and this tendency is stronger for
higher NS masses (or higher total masses). In particular, for the highest mass
NSs ($M_{ns}=2~M_{\odot}$), the errors $\sigma$ can be larger than the true
value of $M_{ns}$ if the dimensionless BH spin exceeds $\sim 0.6$.

level interacting with a thermal free electron wide-band bath, that the
expectation value for the energy of the interacting subsystem can be correctly
calculated by considering a symmetric splitting of the interaction Hamiltonian
between the subsystem and the bath. However, the general implications of this
approach were questioned [Phys. Rev. B {\bf 92}, 235440 (2015)]. Here we show
that already at equilibrium, such splitting fails to describe the energy
fluctuations, as measured here by the second and third central moments (namely
width and skewness) of the energy distribution. Furthermore, we find that when
the wide-band approximation does not hold, no splitting of the system-bath

no proper division subsystem of the Hamiltonian of the composite system can

been claimed that the angular momentum (or spin) of the supermassive black hole
can be robustly measured, using the Fe K$\alpha$ emission line and
Compton-reflection continuum in the X-ray spectrum. The method rests upon the
interpretation of the Fe K$\alpha$ line profile and associated
Compton-reflection continuum in terms of relativistic broadening in the strong
gravity regime in the innermost regions of an accretion disc, within a few
gravitational radii of the black hole. Here, we re-examine a Suzaku X-ray
spectrum of Fairall 9 and show that a face-on toroidal X-ray reprocessor model
involving only nonrelativistic and mundane physics provides an excellent fit to
the data. The Fe K$\alpha$ line emission and Compton reflection continuum are
calculated self-consistently, the iron abundance is solar, and an equatorial
column density of $\sim 10^{24} \ \rm cm^{-2}$ is inferred. In this scenario,
neither the Fe K$\alpha$ line, nor the Compton-reflection continuum provide any
information on the black-hole spin. Whereas previous analyses have assumed an
infinite column density for the distant-matter reprocessor, the shape of the
reflection spectrum from matter with a finite column density eliminates the
need for a relativistically broadened Fe K$\alpha$ line. We find a 90 per cent
confidence range in the Fe K$\alpha$ line FWHM of $1895$-$6205 \ \rm km \
s^{-1}$, corresponding to a distance of $\sim 3100$ to $33,380$ gravitational
radii from the black hole, or $0.015$-$0.49$ pc for a black-hole mass of $\sim

assuming an orthographic projection model, this paper addresses the estimation
of 3D structures and camera projection using symmetry and/or Manhattan
structure cues, which occur when the input is single- or multiple-image from
the same category, e.g., multiple different cars. Specifically, analysis on the
single image case implies that Manhattan alone is sufficient to recover the
camera projection, and then the 3D structure can be reconstructed uniquely
exploiting symmetry. However, Manhattan structure can be difficult to observe
from a single image due to occlusion. To this end, we extend to the
multiple-image case which can also exploit symmetry but does not require
Manhattan axes. We propose a novel rigid structure from motion method,
exploiting symmetry and using multiple images from the same category as input.
Experimental results on the Pascal3D+ dataset show that our method
significantly outperforms baseline methods.

parallel repetition, a promising avenue for achieving many tight
inapproximability results. Feige and Kilian (STOC'95) proved an impossibility
result for randomness-efficient parallel repetition for two prover games with
small degree, i.e., when each prover has only few possibilities for the
question of the other prover. In recent years, there have been indications that
randomness-efficient parallel repetition (also called derandomized parallel
repetition) might be possible for games with large degree, circumventing the
impossibility result of Feige and Kilian. In particular, Dinur and Meir
(CCC'11) construct games with large degree whose repetition can be derandomized
using a theorem of Impagliazzo, Kabanets and Wigderson (SICOMP'12). However,
obtaining derandomized parallel repetition theorems that would yield optimal
inapproximability results has remained elusive.
  This paper presents an explanation for the current impasse in progress, by
proving a limitation on derandomized parallel repetition. We formalize two
properties which we call ""fortification-friendliness"" and ""yields robust
embeddings."" We show that any proof of derandomized parallel repetition
achieving almost-linear blow-up cannot both (a) be fortification-friendly and
(b) yield robust embeddings. Unlike Feige and Kilian, we do not require the
small degree assumption.
  Given that virtually all existing proofs of parallel repetition, including
the derandomized parallel repetition result of Dinur and Meir, share these two
properties, our no-go theorem highlights a major barrier to achieving
almost-linear derandomized parallel repetition.

modern science and technology, and constitutes the working principle for
lasers. In a stimulated emission process, an incoming photon enhances the
probability that an excited atomic state will transition to a lower energy
state and generate a second photon of the same energy. It is expected, but not
experimentally shown, that stimulated emission contributes significantly to the
zero resistance current in a superconductor by enhancing the probability that
scattered Cooper pairs will return to the macroscopically occupied condensate
instead of entering any other state. Here, we use time- and angle-resolved
photoemission spectroscopy to study the initial rise of the non-equilibrium
quasiparticle population in a Bi$_2$Sr$_2$CaCu$_2$O$_{8+\delta}$ cuprate
superconductor induced by an ultrashort laser pulse. Our finding reveals
significantly slower buildup of quasiparticles in the superconducting state
than in the normal state. The slower buildup only occurs when the pump pulse is
too weak to deplete the superconducting condensate, and for cuts inside the
Fermi arc region. We propose this is a manifestation of stimulated
recombination of broken Cooper pairs, and signals an important momentum space
dichotomy in the formation of Cooper pairs inside and outside the Fermi arc
region.

on emergence of sparsely synchronized rhythms, and make comparison with that in
the Watts-Strogatz SWN. Although SR and LR interneurons have the same average
in- and out-degrees, their betweenness centralities (characterizing the
potentiality in controlling communication between other interneurons) are
distinctly different. Hence, in view of the betweenness, SWNs we consider are
inhomogeneous, unlike the ""canonical"" Watts-Strogatz SWN with nearly same
betweenness centralities. As $p_{long}$ is increased, the average path length
becomes shorter, and the load of communication traffic is less concentrated on
LR interneurons, which leads to better efficiency of global communication
between interneurons. Eventually, when passing a critical value
$p_{long}^{(c)}$ $(\simeq 0.16)$, sparsely synchronized rhythms are found to
emerge. We also consider two cases of external time-periodic stimuli applied to
sub-groups of LR and SR interneurons, respectively. Dynamical responses (such

coherence times due to differences in mobility or scattering environment, a
practical scenario where the fundamental limits of communication have been
mostly unknown. This paper studies broadcast and multiple access channels where
multiple receivers experience unequal fading block lengths, and channel state
information (CSI) is not available at the transmitter(s), or for free at any
receiver. In other words, the cost of acquiring CSI at the receiver is fully
accounted for in the degrees of freedom. In the broadcast channel, the method
of product superposition is employed to find the achievable degrees of freedom.
We start with unequal coherence intervals with integer ratios. As long as the
coherence time is at least twice the number of transmit and receive antennas,
these degrees of freedom meet the upper bound in four cases: when the
transmitter has fewer antennas than the receivers, when all receivers have the
same number of antennas, when the coherence time of one receiver is much
shorter than all others, or when all receivers have identical block fading
intervals. The degrees of freedom region of the broadcast under identical
coherence times was also previously unknown and is settled by the results of
this paper. The disparity of coherence times leads to gains that are distinct
from those arising from other techniques such as spatial multiplexing or
multi-user diversity; this class of gains is denoted coherence diversity. The
inner bounds are further extended to the case of multiple receivers
experiencing fading block lengths of arbitrary ratio or alignment. Also, in the
multiple access channel with unequal coherence times, achievable and outer
bounds on the degrees of freedom are obtained.

degenerate regime, the quasiparticle Fermi surface is composed by two arcs,
referred to as Fermi arcs, which are contributed by the electron- and hole-like
branches. The D'yakonov-Perel' spin relaxation is explored, and intriguing
physics is revealed when the Fermi arc emerges. Specifically, when the order
parameter tends to zero, it is found that the branch-mixing scattering is
forbidden in the quasi-electron band. When the condensation process associated
with the annihilation of the quasi-electron and quasi-hole is {\em slow}, this
indicates that the electron- and hole-like Fermi arcs in the quasi-electron
band are independent. The open structure of the Fermi arc leads to the nonzero
angular-average of the effective magnetic field due to the spin-orbit coupling,
which acts as an effective Zeeman field. This Zeeman field leads to the spin
oscillations even in the strong scattering regime. Moreover, in the strong
scattering regime, we show that the open structure of the Fermi arc also leads
to the insensitiveness of the spin relaxation to the momentum scattering, in
contrast to the conventional motional narrowing situation. Nevertheless, with a

opening the inter-branch spin relaxation channel, which is dominant in the

The accurate but computationally expensive Monte-Carlo radiative transfer
calculations are feasible under the one-dimensional approximation. The initial
starburst drives an expanding shell of gas from the centre and in certain cases
Ly{\alpha} feedback significantly enhances the shell velocity. Radiative
feedback alone is capable of ejecting baryons into the intergalactic medium

the IGM such that the observed Ly{\alpha} luminosity is reduced significantly

Within a whole, individual
cities possess different degrees of wholeness, defined by Christopher Alexander
as a life-giving order or simply a living structure. To characterize the
wholeness and in particular to advocate for wholeness as an effective design
principle, this paper develops a geographic representation that views cities as
a whole. This geographic representation is topology-oriented, so fundamentally
differs from existing geometry-based geographic representations. With the
topological representation, all cities are abstracted as individual points and
put into different hierarchical levels, according to their sizes and based on
head/tail breaks - a classification scheme and visualization tool for data with
a heavy tailed distribution. These points of different hierarchical levels are
respectively used to create Thiessen polygons. Based on polygon-polygon
relationships, we set up a complex network. In this network, small polygons
point to adjacent large polygons at the same hierarchical level and contained
polygons point to containing polygons across two consecutive hierarchical
levels. We computed the degrees of wholeness for individual cities, and
subsequently found that the degrees of wholeness possess both properties of
differentiation and adaptation. To demonstrate, we developed four case studies
of all China and UK natural cities, as well as Beijing and London natural
cities, using massive amounts of street nodes and Tweet locations. The
topological representation and the kind of topological analysis in general can
be applied to any design or pattern, such as carpets, Baroque architecture and
artifacts, and fractals in order to assess their beauty, echoing the
introductory quote from Christopher Alexander.

B to relay R, respectively, what is the optimal coefficients $(\alpha,\beta)$

respect to this question are as follows: (1) We put forth a general
Gaussian-integer formulation for complex linear PNC in which $\alpha,\beta,w_A,
w_B$, and $w_N$ are elements of a finite field of Gaussian integers, that is,
the field of $\mathbb{Z}[i]/q$ where $q$ is a Gaussian prime. Previous vector
formulation, in which $w_A$, $w_B$, and $w_N$ were represented by
$2$-dimensional vectors and $\alpha$ and $\beta$ were represented by $2\times
2$ matrices, corresponds to a subcase of our Gaussian-integer formulation where
$q$ is real prime only. Extension to Gaussian prime $q$, where $q$ can be
complex, gives us a larger set of signal constellations to achieve different
rates at different SNR. (2) We show how to divide the complex plane of $\eta$
into different Voronoi regions such that the $\eta$ within each Voronoi region
share the same optimal PNC mapping $(\alpha_{opt},\beta_{opt})$. We uncover the
structure of the Voronoi regions that allows us to compute a minimum-distance
metric that characterizes the SER of $w_N$ under optimal PNC mapping
$(\alpha_{opt},\beta_{opt})$. Overall, the contributions in (1) and (2) yield a
toolset for a comprehensive understanding of complex linear PNC in
$\mathbb{Z}[i]/q$. We believe investigation of linear PNC beyond
$\mathbb{Z}[i]/q$ can follow the same approach.

of the lowest-rest-mass hadronic final states, those that contribute most
significantly to the integral. To that purpose, we use a method in which, while
the PEP-II storage ring is operated at a constant energy in the center of mass
system, $\sqrt{s}$, of about 10.6 GeV, events are reconstructed and selected
which have been produced with a hadronic final state together with a
high-energy photon which may (photon tagging) or may not (no tagging) be
observed. In our kinematic configuration the photon is almost always emitted by
the electron or by the positron of the initial state, hence the name
""initial-state radiation"" (ISR). The cross section for the direct $e^+e^-
\rightarrow f$ production of a final state $f$ at an energy $\sqrt{s'}$ is then
extracted from the differential cross section of the ISR production of the
state $f$ with invariant mass $\sqrt{s'}$. The programme is almost completed
and has lead to a number of first measurements and to an improvement of up to a
factor of three of the uncertainties on the contributions of individual
channels to $a_\mu$.

$G=(V,E)$ and a simple demand graph $H=(V,F)$. Either $G$ and $H$ are directed

set of edges in $G$ such that there is no path from $s$ to $t$ in the remaining
graph for any $(s,t) \in F$. UMulC admits an $O(\log k)$-approximation where
$k$ is the vertex cover size of $H$ while the best known approximation for
DMulC is $\min\{k, \tilde{O}(n^{11/23})\}$. These approximations are obtained
by proving corresponding results on the multicommodity flow-cut gap. In
contrast to these results some special cases of Multicut, such as the
well-studied Multiway Cut problem, admit a constant factor approximation in
both undirected and directed graphs. Motivated by both concrete instances from
applications and abstract considerations, we consider the role that the
structure of the demand graph $H$ plays in determining the approximability of
Multicut.
  In undirected graphs our main result is a $2$-approximation in $n^{O(t)}$
time when the demand graph $H$ excludes an induced matching of size $t$. This
gives a constant factor approximation for a specific demand graph that
motivated this work.
  In contrast to undirected graphs, we prove that in directed graphs such
approximation algorithms can not exist. Assuming the Unique Games Conjecture
(UGC), for a large class of fixed demand graphs DMulC cannot be approximated to
a factor better than worst-case flow-cut gap. As a consequence we prove that
for any fixed $k$, assuming UGC, DMulC with $k$ demand pairs is hard to
approximate to within a factor better than $k$. On the positive side, we prove
an approximation of $k$ when the demand graph excludes certain graphs as an
induced subgraph. This generalizes the Multiway Cut result to a much larger
class of demand graphs.

states controlling electron transport in the system. IF the photon field has
more energy than the cyclotron energy, then the photon field is dominant in the
electron transport. Consequently, the electron transport is enhanced due to
activation of photon replica states. By contrast, the electron transport is

mathematical tool for describing physical and biological processes in the real
world. Often, these physical and biological processes are observed with errors,
in which case the most natural way to model such data is via regression where
the mean function is defined by an ordinary differential equation believed to
provide an understanding of the underlying process. These regression based
dynamical models are called differential equation models. Parameter inference
from differential equation models poses computational challenges mainly due to
the fact that analytic solutions to most differential equations are not
available. In this paper, we propose an approximation method for obtaining the
posterior distribution of parameters in differential equation models. The
approximation is done in two steps. In the first step, the solution of a
differential equation is approximated by the general one-step method which is a
class of numerical methods for ordinary differential equations including the
Euler and the Runge-Kutta procedures; in the second step, nuisance parameters
are marginalized using Laplace approximation. The proposed Laplace approximated
posterior gives a computationally fast alternative to the full Bayesian
computational scheme (such as Markov Chain Monte Carlo) and produces more
accurate and stable estimators than the popular smoothing methods (called
collocation methods) based on frequentist procedures. For a theoretical support
of the proposed method, we prove that the Laplace approximated posterior
converges to the actual posterior under certain conditions and analyze the
relation between the order of numerical error and its Laplace approximation.
The proposed method is tested on simulated data sets and compared with the

time-dependent diffusive shock acceleration of test particles at the
non-relativistic shocks. At first, the solution of Drury (1983) for the
particle distribution function at the shock is generalized to any relation
between the acceleration time-scales upstream and downstream and for the
time-dependent injection efficiency. Three alternative solutions for the
spatial dependence of the distribution function are derived. Then, the two
other approaches to solve the time-dependent equation are presented, one of
which does not require the Laplace transform. At the end, our more general
solution is discussed, with a particular attention to the time-dependent
injection in supernova remnants. It is shown that, comparing to the case with
the dominant upstream acceleration time-scale, the maximum momentum of
accelerated particles shifts toward the smaller momenta with increase of the
downstream acceleration time-scale. The time-dependent injection affects the
shape of the particle spectrum. In particular, i) the power-law index is not
solely determined by the shock compression, in contrast to the stationary
solution; ii) the larger the injection efficiency during the first decades
after the supernova explosion, the harder the particle spectrum around the
high-energy cutoff at the later times. This is important, in particular, for
interpretation of the radio and gamma-ray observations of supernova remnants,
as demonstrated on a number of examples.

price-responsive consumers of electricity. The price-response of the
aggregation is modeled by an optimization problem that is characterized by a
set of marginal utility curves and minimum and maximum power consumption
limits. The task of estimating these parameters is addressed using a
generalized inverse optimization scheme that, in turn, requires solving a
nonconvex mathematical program. We introduce a solution method that overcomes
the nonconvexities by solving instead two linear problems with a penalty term,

proposed methodology is data-driven and leverages information from regressors,
such as time and weather variables, to account for changes in the parameter
estimates. The power load of a group of heating, ventilation, and air

their measured data with respect to the response function of the detector to
provide the distributions of interest, e.g. energy spectra. In this paper,
appropriate uncertainty limits that also allow to draw conclusions on the
geometric shape of the underlying distribution are determined using bootstrap
methods, which are frequently applied in statistical applications. Bootstrap is
a collective term for resampling methods that can be employed to approximate
unknown probability distributions or features thereof. A clear advantage of
bootstrap methods is their wide range of applicability. For instance, they
yield reliable results, even if the usual normality assumption is violated.
  The use, meaning and construction of uncertainty limits to any user-specific
confidence level in the form of confidence intervals and levels are discussed.
The precise algorithms for the implementation of these methods, applicable for
any deconvolution algorithm, are given. The proposed methods are applied to
Monte Carlo simulations to show their feasibility and their precision in
comparison to the statistical uncertainties calculated with the deconvolution
software TRUEE.

will be the use of frequencies in the range 10-100GHz (aka mmWave band) in
densely populated indoor and outdoor scenarios. Due to the reduced wavelength,
antenna arrays with a large number of antennas can be packed in very small
volumes, making thus it possible to consider, at least in principle,
communication links wherein not only the base-station, but also the user
device, are equipped with very large antenna arrays. We denote this
configuration as a ""doubly-massive"" MIMO wireless link. This paper introduces
the concept of doubly massive MIMO systems at mmWave, showing that at mmWave
the fundamentals of the massive MIMO regime are completely different from what
happens at conventional sub-6 GHz cellular frequencies. It is shown for
instance that the multiplexing capabilities of the channel and its rank are no
longer ruled by the number of transmit and receive antennas, but rather by the
number of scattering clusters in the surrounding environment. The implications
of the doubly massive MIMO regime on the transceiver processing, on the system
energy efficiency and on the system throughput are also discussed.

of theories where the added presence of fermion singlets manifesting as sterile

dominant where the light neutrino mass formula is same as the classic inverse
seesaw but all massive neutrinos are Majorana fermions. We also show domunance
of linear seesaw, or double seesaw, or type-II seesaw in due to cancellation of
type-I seesaw. Embeddings of this mechnism in supersymmetric as well as
non-supersymmetric SO(10) with low or intermediate masses of $W_R$ or $Z_R$

a new mechanism of type-II seesaw dominance which permits $U(1)_{B-L}$ breaking

observable predictions, the most visible ones are the dominant contribution to
LFV decays and neutrinoless double beta decay mediated by light sterile

far, no studies have yet investigated the emotional coherence between wall

profiles ""empathy"", the mood coherence between post and comments, was used to
investigate the relation between an excessive self-presentation and the
emotional coherence of a profile. Participants publish a higher average number
of posts with positive mood. To publish an emotional post corresponds to get
more likes, comments and receive a coherent mood of comments, confirming the
emotional contagion effect reported in literature. Finally, the more empathetic
profiles are characterized by an excessive self-presentation, having more
posts, and receiving more comments and likes. To publish emotional contents
appears to be functional to receive more comments and likes, fulfilling needs

order $100\,\mu$Jy beam$^{-1}$ at 323 MHz and $50\,\mu$Jy beam$^{-1}$ at 608

these pulsars and the globular cluster where they are located. In this paper,
the first of a series, we address one of these objectives: the characterization
of four previously known binary pulsars for which no precise orbital parameters
were known, namely 47 Tuc P, V, W and X (pulsars 47 Tuc R and Y are discussed
elsewhere). We determined the previously unknown orbital parameters of 47 Tuc V
and X and greatly improved those of 47 Tuc P and W. For pulsars W and X we
obtained, for the first time, full coherent timing solutions across the whole
data span, which allowed a much more detailed characterization of these
systems. 47 Tuc W, a well-known tight eclipsing binary pulsar, exhibits a large
orbital period variability, as expected for a system of its class. 47 Tuc X
turns out to be in a wide, extremely circular, 10.9-day long binary orbit and
its position is ~3.8 arcmin away from the cluster center, more than three times
the distance of any other pulsar in 47 Tuc. These characteristics make 47 Tuc X
a very different object with respect to the other pulsars of the cluster.

System is a pivotal constraint on theories of planetary formation. Particularly
important from this perspective is the amount of olivine excavated from the
vestan mantle by impacts, as this constrains both the interior structure of
Vesta and the number of major impacts the asteroid suffered during its life.
The NASA Dawn mission revealed that olivine is present on Vesta's surface in
limited quantities, concentrated in small patches at a handful of sites and
interpreted as the result of the excavation of endogenous olivine. Later works
raised the possibility that the olivine had an exogenous origin, based on the
geologic and spectral features of the deposits. In this work we quantitatively
explore the proposed scenario of a exogenous origin for the detected olivine to
investigate whether its presence on Vesta can be explained as a natural outcome
of the collisional history of the asteroid. We took advantage of the impact
contamination model previously developed to study the origin and amount of dark
and hydrated materials observed by Dawn on Vesta, which we updated by
performing dedicated hydrocode impact simulations. We show that the exogenous
delivery of olivine by impacts can offer a viable explanation for the currently
identified olivine-rich sites without violating the constraint posed by the
lack of global olivine signatures on Vesta. Our results indicate that no mantle
excavation is in principle required to explain the observations of the Dawn
mission and support the idea that the vestan crust could be thicker than
indicated by simple geochemical models based on the Howardite-Eucrite-Diogenite
family of meteorites.

them within radii $\lesssim 10$ kpc. We show that this apparent size
restriction is a natural result of AGN driving if this process injects total
energy only of order the gas binding energy to the outflow, and the AGN varies
over time (`flickers') as suggested in recent work. After the end of all AGN
activity the outflow continues to expand to larger radii, powered by the
thermal expansion of the remnant shocked AGN wind. We suggest that on average,
outflows should be detected further from the nucleus in more massive galaxies.
In massive gas--rich galaxies these could be several tens of kpc in radius. We
also consider the effect that pressure of such outflows has on a galaxy disc.
In moderately gas--rich discs, with gas-to-baryon fraction $< 0.2$, the outflow
may induce star formation significant enough to be distinguished from quiescent
by an apparently different normalisation of the Kennicutt-Schmidt law. The star
formation enhancement is probably stronger in the outskirts of galaxy discs, so
coasting outflows might be detected by their effects upon the disc even after
the driving AGN has shut off. We compare our results to the recent inference of
inside--out quenching of star formation in galaxy discs.

series. The effective radius variation of the microresonator is close to a
parabola with a nanoscale height which is greater or equal to lambda/2pi*n0
(here lambda is the characteristic radiation wavelength and n0 is the
refractive index of the microresonator material). Overall, the microresonator
possesses a broadband, small FSR, and accurately equidistant spectrum
convenient for the generation of a broadband and low repetition rate optical
frequency comb. It is shown that this comb can be generated by pumping with a
cw laser, which radiation frequency matches a single axial eigenfrequency of
the microresonator, or, alternatively, by pumping with a mode-locked laser,
which generates a narrowband low repetition rate comb matching a series of
equidistant axial eigenfrequencies situated between adjacent azimuthal
eigenfrequencies.

decouples from its translational dynamics, and the particle angular velocity is
given by Jeffery's theory. It is known that cuboid particles share these

we compute the angular dynamics of crystals that possess a discrete rotation

Jeffery's theory. But there are other examples where the angular dynamics is
determined by a more general equation of motion.

cooperativity length scale {\xi}. We demonstrate, by applying the scaling
hypothesis to the yielding transition, that non-local effects in non-uniform
stress configurations can be explained within the framework of critical
phenomena. From the scaling description, scaling relations between different
exponents are derived, and collapses of strain rate profiles are made both in
shear driven and pressure driven flow. We find that the cooperative length in
non-local flow is governed by the same correlation length in finite dimensional
homogeneous flow, excluding the mean field exponents. We also show that
non-locality also affects the finite size scaling of the yield stress,
especially the large finite size effects observed in pressure driven flow. Our
theoretical results are nicely verified by the elasto-plastic model, and

characterized as the singleton $\{X\}$ being open in the space
$\mathcal{O}(\mathbf{X})$ of open subsets of $\mathbf{X}$. Equivalently, this
means that universal quantification over a compact space preserves open
predicates.
  Using the language of represented spaces, one can make sense of notions such
as a $\Sigma^0_2$-subset of the space of $\Sigma^0_2$-subsets of a given space.
This suggests higher-order analogues to compactness: We can, e.g.~, investigate
the spaces $\mathbf{X}$ where $\{X\}$ is a $\Delta^0_2$-subset of the space of
$\Delta^0_2$-subsets of $\mathbf{X}$. Call this notion $\nabla$-compactness. As
$\Delta^0_2$ is self-dual, we find that both universal and existential
quantifier over $\nabla$-compact spaces preserve $\Delta^0_2$ predicates.
  Recall that a space is called Noetherian iff every subset is compact. Within
the setting of Quasi-Polish spaces, we can fully characterize the
$\nabla$-compact spaces: A Quasi-Polish space is Noetherian iff it is
$\nabla$-compact. Note that the restriction to Quasi-Polish spaces is
sufficiently general to include plenty of examples.

dynamo description. In this work, we investigate the fate of alpha-dynamos as
the magnetic Reynolds number $Rm$ is increased. Using Floquet theory, we are
able to precisely quantify mean field effects like the alpha and beta effect
(i) by rigorously distinguishing dynamo modes that involve large scale
components from the ones that only involve small scales, and by (ii) providing
a way to investigate arbitrary large scale separations with minimal
computational cost. We apply this framework to helical and non-helical flows as
well as to random flows with short correlation time. Our results determine that
the alpha-description is valid for $Rm$ smaller than a critical value $Rm_c$ at
which small scale dynamo instability starts. When $Rm$ is above $Rm_c$ the
dynamo ceases to follow the mean field description and the growth rate of the
large scale modes becomes independent of the scale separation while the energy
in the large scale modes is inversely proportional to the square of the scale
separation. The results in this second regime do not depend on the presence of
helicity. Thus alpha-type modeling for solar and stellar models needs to be
reevaluated and new directions for mean field modeling are proposed.

(BaTMAn), a novel image-segmentation technique based on Bayesian statistics
that characterizes any astronomical dataset containing spatial information and
performs a tessellation based on the measurements and errors provided as input.
The algorithm iteratively merges spatial elements as long as they are
statistically consistent with carrying the same information (i.e. identical
signal within the errors). We illustrate its operation and performance with a
set of test cases including both synthetic and real Integral-Field
Spectroscopic data. The output segmentations adapt to the underlying spatial
structure, regardless of its morphology and/or the statistical properties of
the noise. The quality of the recovered signal represents an improvement with
respect to the input, especially in regions with low signal-to-noise ratio.
However, the algorithm may be sensitive to small-scale random fluctuations, and
its performance in presence of spatial gradients is limited. Due to these
effects, errors may be underestimated by as much as a factor of two. Our
analysis reveals that the algorithm prioritizes conservation of all the
statistically-significant information over noise reduction, and that the
precise choice of the input data has a crucial impact on the results. Hence,
the philosophy of BaTMAn is not to be used as a `black box' to improve the
signal-to-noise ratio, but as a new approach to characterize spatially-resolved

for shared rather than exclusive service, the traditional notion of individual
rationality may be insufficient, as a customer's estimated utility could
fluctuate arbitrarily during their time in the shared system, as long as their
realized utility at service completion is not worse than that for exclusive
service. In this work, within a model that explicitly considers the
""inconvenience costs"" incurred by customers due to sharing, we introduce the
notion of sequential individual rationality (SIR) that requires that the
disutility of existing customers is nonincreasing as the system state changes
due to new customer arrivals. Next, under SIR, we observe that cost sharing can
also be viewed as benefit sharing, which inspires a natural definition of
sequential fairness (SF) - the total incremental benefit due to a new customer
is shared among existing customers in proportion to the incremental
inconvenience suffered.
  We demonstrate the effectiveness of these notions by applying them to a
ridesharing system, where unexpected detours to pick up subsequent passengers
inconvenience the existing passengers. Imposing SIR and SF reveals interesting
and surprising results, including: (a) natural limits on the incremental
detours permissible, (b) exact characterization of ""SIR-feasible"" routes, which
boast sublinear upper and lower bounds on the fractional detours, (c) exact
characterization of sequentially fair cost sharing schemes, which includes a
strong requirement that passengers must compensate each other for the detour
inconveniences that they cause, and (d) new algorithmic problems related to and

shows that a significant amount of this gas lies at regions near the dust

that in many objects the line ratios are far from case B, the best-fit
intrinsic broad-line H$\alpha$/H$\beta$ ratios being in the range 2.5-6.6 as

based on independent estimates from HI and HeII lines, is A$_V$ $\le$ 3 for

comparison of the extinction towards the BLR and narrow line region (NLR)

could also be responsible. The ratios between the X-ray absorbing column N$_H$

is how to make the process fast enough to account for observed explosive energy
releases. The classical model for steady state magnetic reconnection predicts
reconnection times scaling as $S^{1/2}$ (where $S$ is the Lundquist number) and
yields times scales several order of magnitude larger than the observed ones.
Earlier two-dimensional MHD simulations showed that for large Lundquist number
the reconnection time becomes independent of $S$ (""fast reconnection"" regime)
due to the presence of the secondary tearing instability that takes place for
$S \gtrsim 1 \times 10^4$. We report on our 3D MHD simulations of magnetic
reconnection in a magnetically confined cylindrical plasma column under either
a pressure balanced or a force-free equilibrium and compare the results with 2D
simulations of a circular current sheet. We find that the 3D instabilities
acting on these configurations result in a fragmentation of the initial current
sheet in small filaments, leading to enhanced dissipation rate that becomes
independent of the Lundquist number already at $S \simeq 1\times 10^3$.

perspective, for strong non-fragility and weak non-fragility of
controllability, respectively. For multi-agent systems which contain important
agents, partial controllability is proposed in terms of the concept of
controllable node groups, and necessary and sufficient criteria are established
for partial controllability. Moreover, partial controllability preserving
problem is proposed. Utilizing the concept of compressed graphs, this problem
is transformed into finding the the minimal $\mathbf{\langle s,t\rangle}$
vertex cutsets of the interconnection graph, which has a polynomial-time
complexity algorithm for the solution. Several constructive examples illuminate
the theoretical results.

estimating) the LW-number $\lambda(n)$, i.e., the supremum of all $\gamma$ such
that for each convex body $K$ in $\mathbb{R}^n$ there exists an orthonormal
basis $\{u_1,\ldots,u_n\}$ such that $$ vol_n(K)^{n-1} \geq \gamma
\prod_{i=1}^n vol_{n-1} (K|u_i^{\perp}) , $$ where $K|u_i^{\perp}$ denotes the
orthogonal projection of $K$ onto the hyperplane $u_i^{\perp}$ perpendicular to
$u_i$. Any such inequality can be regarded as a reverse to the well-known
classical Loomis--Whitney inequality. We present various results on such
reverse Loomis--Whitney inequalities. In particular, we prove some structural
results, give bounds on $\lambda(n)$ and deal with the problem of actually
computing the LW-constant of a rational polytope.

  Shape","4pages, 5figures",,,,"physics.bio-ph q-bio.CB","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In the past two decades, under the conditions that both the osmotic pressure
$\Delta p$ and tensile stress $\lambda$ equal zero, a rigorous solution (RS) of
human red blood cell (RBC) with a minus spontaneous curvature $c_{0}$ has been
derived with Helfrich model. And, by fitting with observed shapes of RBC,
$c_{0}R_{0}$ has been predicted to be -1.62 as minus golden ratio, where
$R_{0}$ is the radius of a sphere with the same area of RBC. In this Lett., it
is also found $\rho_{max}$ /$\rho_{B}\approx$ 1.6 shows a approximately
beautiful golden cross section of RBC, where $\rho_{max}$ is the radius of RBC
and $\rho_{B}$ is the radius at maximal thickness of RBC. With a complete
numerical calculation, we find the mechanism behind the beauty that minus
golden ratio of $c_{0}R_{0}$ is the balance between economical surface area and
enough deformability to pass spleen, the so called ""physical fitness test"".

  Universe","10 pages","Modern Physics Letters A Vol. 34, No. 38, 1950315 (2019)","10.1142/S0217732319503152",,"physics.gen-ph","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","  In present paper we evaluate the fine structure constant variation, that
should take place as the Universe expands and its curvature is changed
adiabatically. Such variation of the fine structure constant is attributed to
an energy losses by an extended physical system (consist of baryonic component
and electromagnetic field) due to expansion of our Universe.
  Obtained ratio (d alpha)/alpha = 1. 10{-18} (per second) is only five times
smaller than actually reported experimental limit on this value. For this
reason obtained variation can probably be measured within a couple of years. To
argue the correctness of our approach we calculate the Planck constant as
adiabatic invariant of the electromagnetic field propagated on a manifold
characterized by slowly varied geometry, in the framework of the pseudo-
Riemannian geometry. Finally we discuss the double clock experiment based on
Al+ and Hg+ clocks carried out by T. Rosenband et al. (Science 2008). We show
that in this case (when the fine structure constant is changed adiabatically)
the method based on double clock experiment can not be applied to measure the
fine structure constant variation.
