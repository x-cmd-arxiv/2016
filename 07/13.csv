in an interval ranging from the end of the fluid scales to the electron
gyroradius, to introduce the first study of kinetic intermittency, in which
nonlinear structures formed directly in the distribution functions are analyzed
by accounting for velocity space correlations generated by linear (Landau
resonance) and nonlinear phase mixing. Electron structures are found to be
strongly intermittent and dominated by linear phase mixing, while nonlinear
phase mixing dominates the weakly intermittent ions. This is the first time
spatial intermittency and linear phase mixing are shown to be self-consistently
linked for the electrons and, as the magnetic field follows the intermittency
of the electrons at small scales, explain why magnetic islands are places
dominated by Landau damping in steady state turbulence.

assign a subset of $b$ colors to each vertex of G so that adjacent vertices
receive disjoint color subsets. This natural generalization of the classic
coloring problem (the $b=1$ case) is equivalent to finding a homomorphism to
the Kneser graph $KG_{a,b}$, and gives relaxations approaching the fractional
chromatic number.
  We study the complexity of determining whether a graph has an
($a$:$b$)-coloring. Our main result is that this problem does not admit an
algorithm with running time $f(b)\cdot 2^{o(\log b)\cdot n}$, for any
computable $f(b)$, unless the Exponential Time Hypothesis (ETH) fails. A
$(b+1)^n\cdot \text{poly}(n)$-time algorithm due to Nederlof [2008] shows that
this is tight. A direct corollary of our result is that the graph homomorphism
problem does not admit a $2^{O(n+h)}$ algorithm unless ETH fails, even if the
target graph is required to be a Kneser graph. This refines the understanding
given by the recent lower bound of Cygan et al. [SODA 2016].

matrices of Lindstr\""om [Canad. Math. Bull., 1965], which is a combinatorial
tool that, to the best of our knowledge, has not yet been used for proving
complexity lower bounds. As a side result, we prove that the running time of

(DOF). Due to the symmetry between the internal DOFs, certain internal modes
cannot be excited by external forcing (in a case of linear interactions) and
thus are considered ""hidden"". If such a system is weakly asymmetric, the
internal modes remain approximately ""hidden"" from the external excitation,
given that small damping is taken into account. However, already in the case of
weak cubic nonlinearity, these hidden modes can be excited, even as the exact
symmetry is preserved. This excitation occurs through parametric resonance.
Floquet analysis reveals instability patterns for the explored modes. To
perform this analysis with the required accuracy, we suggest a special method
for obtaining the Fourier series of the unperturbed solution for the nonlinear
normal mode. This method does not require explicit integration of the arising
quadratures. Instead, it employs expansion of the solution at the stage of the
implicit quadrature in terms of Chebyshev polynomials. The emerging implicit
equations are solved by using a fixed-point iteration scheme. Poincar\'{e}
sections help to clarify the correspondence between the loss of stability of
the modes and the global structure of the dynamical flow. In particular, the
conditions for intensive energy exchange in the system are characterized.

narrower and it is likely emitted by gas of the broad-line region more distant

to have been subjected to a complex orbital evolution. Given the chance of
encountering Jupiter to ~0.6 AU some 400 days after perihelion, C/1846 O1 and

BCE, into orbits that were, respectively, smaller and larger than was the
parent's, with a net difference of more than 0.002 (AU)^{-1} in 1/a. Whereas
C/1973 D1 was on the way to its 1973 perihelion, C/1846 O1 should have been
subjected to recurring encounters with Jupiter, during which the orbital period
continued to shorten by integral multiples of the Jovian orbital period, a
process called high-order orbital-cascade resonance. While the integrated
perturbation effect of C/1846 O1 by Jupiter does not appear to reduce the

years, the most recent advances pointed out that the energy harvesting and
wireless charging techniques may offer means to overcome such a limitation.
Consequently, an issue that had been put in second place, now emerges: the low
availability of spectrum resources. Because of it, the incorporation of the
WSNs into the Internet of Things and the exponential growth of the latter may
be hindered if no control over the data generation is taken. Alternatively,
part of the sensed data can be predicted without triggering transmissions and
congesting the wireless medium. In this work, we analyze and categorize
existing prediction-based data reduction mechanisms that have been designed for
WSNs. Our main contribution is a systematic procedure for selecting a scheme to
make predictions in WSNs, based on WSNs' constraints, characteristics of
prediction methods and monitored data. Finally, we conclude the paper with a
discussion about future challenges and open research directions in the use of
prediction methods to support the WSNs' growth.

shows that (1) the Lifty policy language is sufficiently expressive to specify
many real-world policies, (2) the Lifty type checker is able to verify secure

able to patch all leaks automatically within a reasonable time.

Stellar populations are the building blocks of galaxies including
the Milky Way. The majority, if not all extragalactic studies are entangled
with the use of stellar population models given the unresolved nature of their
observation. Extragalactic systems contain multiple stellar populations with
complex star formation histories. However, their study is mainly based upon the
principles of simple stellar populations (SSP). Hence, it is critical to
examine the validity of SSP models. AIMS. This work aims to empirically test
the validity of SSP models. This is done by comparing SSP models against
observations of spatially resolved young stellar population in the
determination of its physical properties, i.e. age and metallicity. METHODS.
Integral field spectroscopy of a young stellar cluster in the Milky Way, NGC
3603, is used to study the properties of the cluster both as a resolved and
unresolved stellar population. The unresolved stellar population is analysed
using the H$\alpha$ equivalent width as an age indicator, and the ratio of
strong emission lines to infer metallicity. In addition, spectral energy
distribution (SED) fitting using STARLIGHT, is used to infer these properties
from the integrated spectrum. Independently, the resolved stellar population is
analysed using the color-magnitude diagram (CMD) for age and metallicity
determination. As the SSP model represents the unresolved stellar population,
the derived age and metallicity are put to test whether they agree with those
derived from resolved stars. RESULTS. The age and metallicity estimate of NGC
3603 derived from integrated spectroscopy are confirmed to be within the range
of those derived from the CMD of the resolved stellar population, including
other estimates found in the literature. The result from this pilot study
supports the reliability of SSP models for studying unresolved young stellar
populations.

conductance at the center of vortex core, which may be attributed to the spin

the other at the south pole. While the MZM is not a spin eigenstate, the spin
wavefunction of the MZM at the center of the vortex core, r = 0, is parallel to
the magnetic field, and the local Andreev reflection of the MZM is spin
selective, namely occurs only when the STM tip has the spin polarization
parallel to the magnetic field, similar to the case in 1-dimensional nanowire2.
The total local differential tunneling conductance consists of the normal term
proportional to the local density of states and an additional term arising from
the Andreev reflection. We also discuss the finite size effect, for which the
MZM at the north pole is hybridized with the MZM at the south pole. We apply

concrete type of security attack, named side-channel attack, which exploit the
correlation between specific non-functional properties (such as packet
latencies and routes, in the case of NoCs) to infer the functional behaviour of
secure applications. For instance, the transmission of a packet over a given
link of the NoC may hint on a cache miss, which can be used by an attacker to
guess specific parts of a secret cryptographic key, effectively weakening it.
  We therefore propose packet route randomisation as a mechanism to increase
NoC resilience against side-channel attacks, focusing specifically on the
potential impact of such an approach upon hard real-time systems, where
schedulability is a vital design requirement. Using an evolutionary

the interactions of long-wavelength fluctuations with the spectrum of
smaller-scale perturbations. We find that the RG flow exhibits an attractor

for a self-contained computation of matter and velocity power spectra for which

couplings from the probability theory literature. However, existing work using
pRHL merely shows existence of a coupling and does not give a way to prove
quantitative properties about the coupling, which are need to reason about
mixing and convergence of probabilistic processes. Furthermore, pRHL is
inherently incomplete, and is not able to capture some advanced forms of
couplings such as shift couplings. We address both problems as follows.
  First, we define an extension of pRHL, called xpRHL, which explicitly
constructs the coupling in a pRHL derivation in the form of a probabilistic
product program that simulates two correlated runs of the original program.
Existing verification tools for probabilistic programs can then be directly
applied to the probabilistic product to prove quantitative properties of the
coupling. Second, we equip pRHL with a new rule for while loops, where
reasoning can freely mix synchronized and unsynchronized loop iterations. Our
proof rule can capture examples of shift couplings, and the logic is relatively
complete for deterministic programs.
  We show soundness of xpRHL and use it to analyze two classes of examples.
First, we verify rapid mixing using different tools from coupling: standard
coupling, shift coupling, and path coupling, a compositional principle for
combining local couplings into a global coupling. Second, we verify
(approximate) equivalence between a source and an optimized program for several
instances of loop optimizations from the literature.

  Our result indicates that the amplification can be independently measured

wave astronomy, owing to the omni-directional nature of gravitational wave
detection techniques, and the often intrinsically weak signals being observed.
Ground-based detectors can address the pointing problem by observing with a
network of detectors, effectively triangulating signal locations by observing
the arrival times across the network. Space-based detectors will observe
long-lived sources that persist while the detector moves relative to their
location on the sky, using Doppler shifts of the signal to locate the sky
position. While these methods improve the pointing capability of a detector or
network, the angular resolution is still coarse compared to the standards one
expects from electromagnetic astronomy. Another technique that can be used for
sky localization is null-stream pointing. In the case where multiple
independent data streams exist, a single astrophysical source of gravitational
waves will appear in each of the data streams. Taking the signals from multiple
detectors in linear combination with each other, one finds there is a two
parameter family of coefficients that effectively null the gravitational wave
signal; those two parameters are the angles that define the sky location of the
source. This technique has been demonstrated for a network of ground-based
interferometric observatories, and for 6-link space interferometers. This paper
derives and extends the null-stream pointing method to the unique case of
pulsar timing residuals. The basic method is derived and demonstrated, and the
necessity of using the method with multiple sub-arrays of pulsars in the pulsar

which are sensitive to the coronal magnetic field. However, inverting such
polarimetric measurements into magnetic field data is a difficult task because
the corona is optically thin at these wavelengths and the observed signal is
therefore the integrated emission of all the plasma along the line of sight. To
overcome this difficulty, we take on a new approach that combines a
parameterized 3D magnetic field model with forward modeling of the polarization
signal. For that purpose, we develop a new, fast and efficient, optimization
method for model-data fitting: the Radial-basis-functions Optimization
Approximation Method (ROAM). Model-data fitting is achieved by optimizing a
user-specified log-likelihood function that quantifies the differences between
the observed polarization signal and its synthetic/predicted analogue. Speed
and efficiency are obtained by combining sparse evaluation of the magnetic
model with radial-basis-function (RBF) decomposition of the log-likelihood
function. The RBF decomposition provides an analytical expression for the
log-likelihood function that is used to inexpensively estimate the set of
parameter values optimizing it. We test and validate ROAM on a synthetic test
bed of a coronal magnetic flux rope and show that it performs well with a
significantly sparse sample of the parameter space. We conclude that our
optimization method is well-suited for fast and efficient model-data fitting

  Classification",,,,,"cs.CV math.OC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  One of the difficulties in 3D reconstruction of molecules from images in
single particle Cryo-Electron Microscopy (Cryo-EM), in addition to high levels
of noise and unknown image orientations, is heterogeneity in samples: in many
cases, the samples contain a mixture of molecules, or multiple conformations of
one molecule. Many algorithms for the reconstruction of molecules from images
in heterogeneous Cryo-EM experiments are based on iterative approximations of
the molecules in a non-convex optimization that is prone to reaching suboptimal
local minima. Other algorithms require an alignment in order to perform
classification, or vice versa. The recently introduced Non-Unique Games
framework provides a representation theoretic approach to studying problems of
alignment over compact groups, and offers convex relaxations for alignment
problems which are formulated as semidefinite programs (SDPs) with certificates
of global optimality under certain circumstances. In this manuscript, we
propose to extend Non-Unique Games to the problem of simultaneous alignment and
classification with the goal of simultaneously classifying Cryo-EM images and
aligning them within their respective classes. Our proposed approach can also
be extended to the case of continuous heterogeneity.

expressed as a center of gravity with the notion of a pseudo-centroid (or a

problems where points do not have numerical coordinates (or categorical
coordinates that are translated into numerical form). Such problems, for which
classical centroids do not exist, are particularly important in social
sciences, marketing, psychology and economics, where distances are not computed
from vector coordinates but rather are expressed in terms of characteristics
such as affinity relationships, psychological preferences, advertising

broadly conceived, measure the similarity (or dissimilarity) of
characteristics, functions or structures.
  We formulate a K-PC algorithm analogous to a K-Means algorithm, and identify
two key types of pseudo-centroids, MinMax centroids and (weighted) MinSum
centroids, and describe how they respectively give rise to a K-MinMax algorithm

also introduce a Regret-Threshold PC algorithm that modifies the K-PC algorithm

resorted to the (generalized) consistent weighted sampling (GCWS) to convert
the GMM kernel to linear kernel. We call this approach as ``GMM-GCWS''.
  In the machine learning literature, there is a popular algorithm which we
call ``RBF-RFF''. That is, one can use the ``random Fourier features'' (RFF) to
convert the ``radial basis function'' (RBF) kernel to linear kernel. It was
empirically shown in (Li, 2016) that RBF-RFF typically requires substantially
more samples than GMM-GCWS in order to achieve comparable accuracies.
  The Nystrom method is a general tool for computing nonlinear kernels, which
again converts nonlinear kernels into linear kernels. We apply the Nystrom
method for approximating the GMM kernel, a strategy which we name as
``GMM-NYS''. In this study, our extensive experiments on a set of fairly large
datasets confirm that GMM-NYS is also a strong competitor of RBF-RFF.

following NMS forms a piecewise-constant structured loss over thousands of

descent. Hence, we define new, general gradient-like quantities for piecewise

these efficiently for mAP following NMS, enabling to train a detector based on
Fast R-CNN directly for mAP. This model achieves equivalent performance to the

we present the functional integration over a set of geometries using a
single-variable function to interpolate between black-hole and white-hole

result which depends only on the Schwarzschild mass and a parameter measuring
the width of the interpolating region. The associated probability distribution
displays an exponential decay law on the latter parameter, with a mean lifetime
inversely proportional to the Schwarzschild mass. In physical terms this would
imply that matter collapsing to a black hole from a finite radius bounces back
elastically and instantaneously, with negligible time delay as measured by
external observers. These results invite to reconsider the ultimate nature of
astrophysical black holes, providing a possible mechanism for the formation of
black stars instead of proper general relativistic black holes. The existence
of both this decay channel and black stars can be tested in future observations

in machine learning and across domains that analyze structured data. Recent
work has evaluated these methods though the seed set expansion problem: given a
subset $S$ of nodes from a community of interest in an underlying graph, can we
reliably identify the rest of the community? We start from the observation that
the most widely used techniques for this problem, personalized PageRank and
heat kernel methods, operate in the space of landing probabilities of a random
walk rooted at the seed set, ranking nodes according to weighted sums of
landing probabilities of different length walks. Both schemes, however, lack an
a priori relationship to the seed set objective. In this work we develop a
principled framework for evaluating ranking methods by studying seed set
expansion applied to the stochastic block model. We derive the optimal gradient
for separating the landing probabilities of two classes in a stochastic block
model, and find, surprisingly, that under reasonable assumptions the gradient
is asymptotically equivalent to personalized PageRank for a specific choice of
the PageRank parameter $\alpha$ that depends on the block model parameters.
This connection provides a novel formal motivation for the success of
personalized PageRank in seed set expansion and node ranking generally. We use
this connection to propose more advanced techniques incorporating higher
moments of landing probabilities; our advanced methods exhibit greatly improved
performance despite being simple linear classification rules, and are even
competitive with belief propagation.

believed to be caused by the interactions of an active galactic nucleus (AGN)

moderately massive galaxies without expelling too many baryons has however
proven difficult for hydrodynamical simulations of galaxy formation, prompting
us to explore a new model for the accretion and feedback effects of
supermassive black holes. For high accretion rates relative to the Eddington
limit, we assume that a fraction of the accreted rest mass energy heats the
surrounding gas thermally, similar to the `quasar mode' in previous work. For
low accretion rates, we invoke a new, pure kinetic feedback model which imparts
momentum into the surrounding gas in a stochastic manner. These two modes of
feedback are motivated both by theoretical conjectures for the existence of
different types of accretion flows as well as recent observational evidence for
the importance of kinetic AGN winds in quenching galaxies. We find that a large
fraction of the injected kinetic energy in this mode thermalises via shocks in
the surrounding gas, thereby providing a distributed heating channel. In
cosmological simulations, the resulting model produces red, non star-forming
massive elliptical galaxies, and achieves realistic gas fractions, black hole
growth histories and thermodynamic profiles in large haloes.

tiny angular extent, while observed spectral lines are smeared by averaging
over the stellar surface, and by stellar rotation. Exoplanet transits can be
used to analyze stellar atmospheric structure, yielding high-resolution spectra
across spatially highly resolved stellar surfaces, free from effects of spatial
smearing and the rotational wavelength broadening present in full-disk spectra.
During a transit, stellar surface portions successively become hidden, and
differential spectroscopy between various transit phases provides spectra of
those surface segments then hidden behind the planet. The small area subtended
by even a large planet (about 1% of a main-sequence star) offers high spatial
resolution but demands very precise observations. We demonstrate the
reconstruction of photospheric FeI line profiles at a spectral resolution

understanding of stellar atmospheres requires modeling with 3-dimensional
hydrodynamics. The properties predicted by such models are mapped onto the
precise spectral-line shapes, asymmetries and wavelength shifts, and their
variation from the center to the limb across any stellar disk. This method
provides a tool for testing and verifying such models. The method will soon
become applicable to more diverse types of stars, thanks to new spectrometers

this end we investigate convex sets generated by expectation values of certain
observables with respect to all possible probability distributions of classical
q-state spins on a two-dimensional lattice, for several values of q. The
extreme points of these sets are then given by thermal Gibbs states of the
classical q-state Potts model. As symmetry breaking phase transitions and the
emergence of associated order parameters are signaled by the appearance ruled
surfaces on these sets, this implies that symmetry breaking is ultimately a
consequence of the geometrical structure of probability space. In particular we
identify the different features arising for continuous and first order phase
transitions and show how to obtain critical exponents and susceptibilities from
the geometrical shape of the surface set. Such convex sets thus also constitute
a novel and very intuitive way of constructing phase diagrams for many body
systems, as all thermodynamically relevant quantities can be very naturally
read off from these sets.

The two most favoured scenarios for this evolution are either the size growth
of individual galaxies through a sequence of dry minor merger events, or the
addition of larger, newly quenched galaxies to the pre-existing population
(i.e., a progenitor bias effect). We use the 20k zCOSMOS-bright spectroscopic
survey to select bona fide quiescent galaxies at 0.2<z<0.8. We stack their
spectra in bins of redshift, stellar mass and size to compute stellar
population parameters in these bins through fits to the rest-frame optical
spectra and through Lick spectral indices. We confirm a change of behaviour in
the size-age relation below and above the ~10^11 MSun stellar mass scale: In
our 10.5 < log M*/MSun < 11 mass bin, over the entire redshift window, the
stellar populations of the largest galaxies are systematically younger than
those of the smaller counterparts, pointing at progenitor bias as the main
driver of the observed average size evolution at sub-10^11 MSun masses. In
contrast, at higher masses, there is no clear trend in age as a function of
galaxy size, supporting a substantial role of dry mergers in increasing the
sizes of these most massive QGs with cosmic time. Within the errors, the
[alpha/Fe] abundance ratios of QGs are (i) above-solar over the entire redshift
range of our analysis, hinting at universally short timescales for the buildup
of the stellar populations of QGs, and (ii) similar at all masses and sizes,
suggesting similar (short) timescales for the whole QG population and
strengthening the role of mergers in the buildup of the most massive QGs in the

mechanics (OPQM) and the classical electromagnetic four-potential arise from
quantum field theory (QFT). In addition, the classical Maxwell equations are
derived from a QFT scattering process, while both classical electromagnetic
fields and potentials serve as mathematical tools to approximate the
interactions among elementary particles described by QFT physics. Furthermore,
a plausible interpretation of the Aharonov-Bohm (AB) effect is raised within
the QFT framework. We provide a quantum treatment of the source of
electromagnetic potentials and argue that the underlying mechanism in the AB
effect can be understood via interactions among electrons described by QFT
where the interactions are mediated by virtual photons.

used for recommending information by relevance inferred directly from brain

prediction of word relevance, the individual's search intent was modeled and
successfully used for retrieving new, relevant documents from the whole English

right-handed (RH) gauge bosons $W_R$ - an inherent ingredient of Left-Right
Symmetric Models (LRSM). We focus on the regime where the $W_R$ is very heavy
compared to the heavy Majorana neutrino $N$, and investigate an alternative
signature for $W_R \rightarrow N$ decays. The produced neutrinos are highly
boosted in this mass regime. Subsequently, their decays via off-shell $W_R$
bosons to jets, i.e., $N \rightarrow \ell^\pm j j$ are highly collimated,
forming a single neutrino jet $(j_N)$. The final-state collider signature is
then $\ell^\pm j_N$, instead of the widely studied $\ell^\pm\ell^\pm jj$.
Present search strategies are not sensitive to this hierarchical mass regime
due to the breakdown of the collider signature definition. We take into account
QCD corrections beyond next-to-leading order (NLO) that are important for
high-mass Drell-Yan processes at the 13 TeV Large Hadron Collider (LHC). For
the first time, we evaluate $W_R$ production at NLO with threshold resummation
at next-to-next-to-leading logarithm (NNLL) matched to the threshold-improved
parton distributions. With these improvements, we find that a ${W_R}$ of mass
$M_{W_R} = 3~(4)~[5]$ TeV and mass ratio of $(m_N/M_{W_R})<0.1$ can be
discovered with a $5-6 \sigma$ statistical significance at 13 TeV after
${10~(100)~[2000]~\text{fb}^{-1}}$ of data. Extending the analysis to the

of HST along time-like geodesics of AdS space-time, fit nicely into the FRW
patch of AdS space. The coordinate singularity of the FRW patch is identified
with the proper time at which the Hilbert space of the causal diamond becomes
infinite dimensional. For diamonds much smaller than the AdS radius, RAdS, the
time dependent Hamiltonians of HST are the same as those used to describe
similar diamonds in Minkowski space. In particular, they are invariant under
the fuzzy analog of volume preserving diffeomorphisms of the holographic
screen, which leads to fast scrambling of perturbations on the horizon of a
black hole of size smaller than RAdS. We argue that, in order to take a limit
of this system which converges to a CFT, one must choose Hamiltonians, in a
range of proper times of order RAdS, which break this invariance, and become
local in a particular choice of basis for the variables. We show that,
beginning with flat, sub-RAdS, patches of dimension D, the resulting CFT,
constructed from the variables of HST, is inconsistent with the entropy of
large black holes, unless one has at least two compact dimensions, whose size
is of order RAdS. The argument is connected to a new observation about the
scrambling rate of information localized on the compact dimensions. Our
construction explains why large AdS black holes do not have the fast scrambling
property. Our present approach cannot deal with models where string theory is
weakly coupled and RAdS is of order the string scale, because the relationship
between area and entropy is non-universal in such models. On spatial length
scales longer than RAdS, our mapping of HST variables into CFT shares much with
the Tensor Network Renormalization Group (TNRG)[1] and is a sort of evolving
error correcting code[2].

however, they do so for large classes of algebras described in this article.
  Algebras $A$ of $\nu$-dominant dimension at least one have unique largest
non-trivial self-injective centraliser subalgebras $H_A$. A derived restriction
theorem is proved: A derived equivalence between $A$ and $B$ implies a derived
equivalence between $H_A$ and $H_B$.
  Two methods are developed to show that global and dominant dimension are
preserved by derived equivalences between algebras of $\nu$-dominant dimension
at least one with anti-automorphisms preserving simples, and also between
almost self-injective algebras. One method is based on identifying particular
derived equivalences preserving homological dimensions, while the other method
identifies homological dimensions inside certain derived categories.
  In particular, derived equivalent cellular algebras have the same global
dimension. As an application, the global and dominant dimensions of blocks of
quantised Schur algebras with $n \geq r$ are completely determined.

been studied by numerous mathematicians, initially for measures that satisfy

  In this paper, our focus is on finite type measures defined on the torus, the
quotient space $\mathbb{R}\backslash \mathbb{Z}$. We give criteria which
ensures that the set of local dimensions of the measure taken over points in
special classes generates an interval. We construct a non-trivial example of a

dimensions. We prove that the set of local dimensions for a finite type measure
that is the quotient of a self-similar measure satisfying the strict separation
condition is an interval. We show that sufficiently many convolutions of
Cantor-like measures on the torus never admit an isolated point in their set of
local dimensions, in stark contrast to such measures on $\mathbb{R}$. Further,
we give a family of Cantor-like measures on the torus where the set of local
dimensions is a strict subset of the set of local dimensions, excluding the
isolated point, of the corresponding measures on $\mathbb{R}$.

new model called Deep Reconstruction-Classification Network (DRCN), which
jointly learns a shared encoding representation for two tasks: i) supervised
classification of labeled source data, and ii) unsupervised reconstruction of
unlabeled target data.In this way, the learnt representation not only preserves
discriminability, but also encodes useful information from the target domain.
Our new DRCN model can be optimized by using backpropagation similarly as the
standard neural networks.
  We evaluate the performance of DRCN on a series of cross-domain object
recognition tasks, where DRCN provides a considerable improvement (up to ~8% in
accuracy) over the prior state-of-the-art algorithms. Interestingly, we also
observe that the reconstruction pipeline of DRCN transforms images from the
source domain into images whose appearance resembles the target dataset. This
suggests that DRCN's performance is due to constructing a single composite
representation that encodes information about both the structure of target
images and the classification of source images. Finally, we provide a formal
analysis to justify the algorithm's objective in domain adaptation context.

demonstrated that variable-length coding combined with stop-feedback
significantly increases the speed of convergence of the maximum coding rate to
capacity. This speed-up manifests itself in the absence of a square-root
penalty in the asymptotic expansion of the maximum coding rate for large

The best-fit model image indicates that the cavity should be detectable in the

explained by the presence of sub-microns grains interior to the sub-mm cavity

waves, which should appear as B-modes in the CMB, in light of the fact that the
standard inflationary paradigm is unable to account for the transition from an
initially symmetric state into a non-symmetric outcome. We show that the
incorporation of an element capable of explaining such a transition
dramatically alters the prediction for the shape and size of the B-mode

collapse model to the situation at hand, the B-mode spectrum gets strongly
suppressed with respect to the standard prediction. We conclude that the
failure to detect B-modes in the CMB does not rule-out the simplest

high interest because of its role in biological processes such as transport in
cell membranes. In partially phase-separated solutions, gradient-driven
diffusion affects microstructure, which in turn affects diffusivity; a key
question is how this complex coupling controls both transport and pattern
formation. To examine these mechanisms, we study a two-dimensional
multi-component lattice gas model, where ""tracer"" molecules diffuse between a
source and a sink separated by a solution of sticky ""crowder"" molecules that
cluster to form dynamically evolving obstacles. In the high temperature limit,
crowders and tracers are miscible and transport may be predicted analytically.
At intermediate temperatures, crowders phase separate into clusters that drift
toward the tracer sink. As a result, steady-state tracer diffusivity depends
non-monotonically on both temperature and crowder density and we observe a
variety of complex microstructures. In the low temperature limit, crowders
rapidly aggregate to form obstacles that are kinetically arrested; if crowder
density is near the percolation threshold, resulting tracer diffusivity shows
scaling behavior with the same scaling exponent as the random resistor network
model. Though highly idealized, this simple model reveals fundamental
mechanisms governing coupled gradient-driven diffusion, phase separation, and
microstructural evolution in crowded solutions.

  Formal Knowledge","Re-written abstract and intro, other minor changes throughout. This
  version published at AAAI 2017",,,,"cs.CL","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Traditional semantic parsers map language onto compositional, executable
queries in a fixed schema. This mapping allows them to effectively leverage the
information contained in large, formal knowledge bases (KBs, e.g., Freebase) to
answer questions, but it is also fundamentally limiting---these semantic
parsers can only assign meaning to language that falls within the KB's
manually-produced schema. Recently proposed methods for open vocabulary
semantic parsing overcome this limitation by learning execution models for
arbitrary language, essentially using a text corpus as a kind of knowledge
base. However, all prior approaches to open vocabulary semantic parsing replace
a formal KB with textual information, making no use of the KB in their models.
We show how to combine the disparate representations used by these two
approaches, presenting for the first time a semantic parser that (1) produces
compositional, executable representations of language, (2) can successfully
leverage the information contained in both a formal KB and a large corpus, and
(3) is not limited to the schema of the underlying KB. We demonstrate
significantly improved performance over state-of-the-art baselines on an
open-domain natural language question answering task.

pre-main sequence (pre-MS) stars. Spectral types of pre-MS stars are
wavelength-dependent, with near-infrared spectra being 3-5 spectral sub-classes
later than the spectral types determined from optical spectra. In addition, the
intrinsic colors of young stars differ from that of main-sequence stars at a
given spectral type. We caution observers to adopt optical spectral types over
near-infrared types, since Hertzsprung-Russell (H-R) diagram positions derived
from optical spectral types provide consistency between dynamical masses and
theoretical evolutionary tracks. We also urge observers to deredden pre-MS
stars with tabulations of intrinsic colors specifically constructed for young
stars, since their unreddened colors differ from that of main sequence dwarfs.
Otherwise, V-band extinctions as much as ~0.6 mag erroneously higher than the
true extinction may result, which would introduce systematic errors in the H-R
diagram positions and thus bias the inferred ages.

bounded state space, whose deterministic limit is given by a map of the unit
interval. We find that, in the mesoscopic description of the system, the large
jumps between successive iterates of the process can result in probability
leaking out of the unit interval, despite the fact that the noise is
multiplicative and vanishes at the boundaries. By including higher-order terms
in the mesoscopic expansion, we are able to capture the non-Gaussian nature of
the noise distribution near the boundaries, but this does not preclude the
possibility of a trajectory leaving the interval. We propose a number of
prescriptions for treating these escape events, and we compare the results with
those obtained for the metastable behavior of the microscopic model, where
escape events are not possible. We find that, rather than truncating the noise
distribution, censoring this distribution to prevent escape events leads to
results which are more consistent with the microscopic model. The addition of
higher moments to the noise distribution does not increase the accuracy of the
final results, and it can be replaced by the simpler Gaussian noise.

negative drift $-\mu$. It is possible to make sense of conditioning this
process to be in the state $0$ at an independent exponential random time and if
we kill the conditioned process at the exponential time the resulting process
is Markov. If we let the rate parameter of the random time go to $0$, then the
limit of the killed Markov process evolves like $X$ conditioned to hit $0$,
after which time it behaves as $X$ killed at the last time $X$ visits $0$.
Equivalently, the limit process has the dynamics of the killed ""bang--bang""
Brownian motion that evolves like Brownian motion with positive drift $+\mu$
when it is negative, like Brownian motion with negative drift $-\mu$ when it is
positive, and is killed according to the local time spent at $0$.
  An extension of this result holds in great generality for Borel right
processes conditioned to be in some state $a$ at an exponential random time, at
which time they are killed. Our proofs involve understanding the Campbell
measures associated with local times, the use of excursion theory, and the
development of a suitable analogue of the ""bang--bang"" construction for general
Markov processes.
  As examples, we consider the special case when the transient Borel right
process is a one-dimensional diffusion. Characterizing the limiting conditioned
and killed process via its infinitesimal generator leads to an investigation of
the $h$-transforms of transient one-dimensional diffusion processes that goes
beyond what is known and is of independent interest.

The dual cone $\Sigma_X^\ast$ is a spectrahedron and we show that its convexity
properties are closely related to homological properties of $X$. For instance,
we show that all extreme rays of $\Sigma_X^\ast$ have rank one if and only if X
has Castelnuovo-Mumford regularity two. More generally, if $\Sigma_X^\ast$ has
an extreme ray of rank $p > 1$, then $X$ does not satisfy the property

find that neither stochastic sampling of the luminosity function in galaxies

efficiencies which result in proportionally greater numbers of bright

Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) operator for large scale inverse problems are
typically based on approximating the reduced Hessian with the regularization
operator. However, the quality of this approximation degrades with increasingly
informative observations or data. Thus the best case scenario from a scientific
standpoint (fully informative data) is the worse case scenario from a
computational perspective. In this paper we present an augmented
Lagrangian-type preconditioner based on a block diagonal approximation of the
augmented upper left block of the KKT operator. The preconditioner requires
solvers for two linear subproblems that arise in the augmented KKT operator,
which we expect to be much easier to precondition than the reduced Hessian.
Analysis of the spectrum of the preconditioned KKT operator indicates that the
preconditioner is effective when the regularization is chosen appropriately. In
particular, it is effective when the regularization does not over-penalize
highly informed parameter modes and does not under-penalize uninformed modes.
Finally, we present a numerical study for a large data/low noise Poisson source
inversion problem, demonstrating the effectiveness of the preconditioner. In
this example, three MINRES iterations on the KKT system with our preconditioner
results in a reconstruction with better accuracy than 50 iterations of CG on

specified by the two peak degree distribution fully incorporating the
degree-degree correlation between node connection. The structure of the
correlated bimodal network is uniquely determined by the Pearson coefficient of
the degree correlation, keeping its degree distribution fixed. The percolation
threshold and the giant component fraction of the correlated bimodal network
are analytically calculated in the whole range of the Pearson coefficient from
$-1$ to $1$ against two major types of node removal, which are the random
failure and the degree-based targeted attack. The Pearson coefficient for
next-nearest-neighbor pairs is also calculated, which always takes a positive
value even when the correlation between nearest-neighbor pairs is negative.
From the results, it is confirmed that the percolation threshold is a
monotonically decreasing function of the Pearson coefficient for the degrees of
nearest-neighbor pairs increasing from $-1$ and $1$ regardless of the types of
node removal. In contrast, the node fraction of the giant component for bimodal
networks with positive degree correlation rapidly decreases in the early stage
of random failure, while that for bimodal networks with negative degree
correlation remains relatively large until the removed node fraction reaches
the threshold. In this sense, bimodal networks with negative degree correlation
are more robust against random failure than those with positive degree
correlation.

metallicity of the universe have been enriched beyond the critical value of
$Z_{\rm crit}=10^{-3.5}Z_{\odot}$, the star formation shift from Pop III to Pop
I/II stars. Our results show that the SFRs are quite dependent on the WDM
particle mass, especially at high redshifts. Combing with the reionization
history and CMB optical depth derived from the recent \emph{Planck} mission, we
find that the current data requires the WDM particle mass in a narrow range of
$1 < m_x < 3$ keV. Furthermore, we suggest that the stochastic gravitational
wave background (SGWB) produced by stellar BHs could give a further constraint

Salpeter (Chabrier) initial mass function (IMF), the SGWB from Pop I/II BHs has
a peak amplitude of $\Omega_{\rm GW}\approx2.8\times 10^{-9}~(5.0\times

suppressed. For $m_{\rm x}=1$ keV, the SGWB peak amplitude is the same as that
of $m_{\rm x}=1$ keV, but a little lower at low frequencies. Therefore, it is
hard to constrain the WDM particle mass by the SGWB from Pop I/II BHs. To
assess the detectability of GW signal, we also calculate the signal to noise
ratio (SNR), which are $\rm SNR=37.7~ (66.5)$ and $27~(47.7)$ for $m_{\rm x}=3$

to gravitational potential energy, and R_B measuring the ellipticity or ring
thickness. Unlike in the incompressible case, not all values of R_B yield an
isothermal equilibrium, and the range of R_B for such equilibria shrinks with
decreasing alpha. The density distributions in the meridional plane are steeper
for smaller alpha, and well approximated by those of infinite cylinders for
slender rings. We also calculate the dispersion relations of nonaxisymmetric
modes in rigidly-rotating slender rings with angular frequency Omega_0 and
central density rho_max. Rings with smaller alpha are found more unstable with
a larger unstable range of the azimuthal mode number. The instability is
completely suppressed by rotation when Omega_0 exceeds the critical value. The
critical angular frequency is found to be almost constant at ~ 0.7
sqrt(G*rho_c) for alpha > 0.01 and increases rapidly for smaller alpha. We

implies $P$ is isomorphic to $Q$ (such a dcpo $P$ will be called Scott closed

interacting with a two-component spin-orbit coupled Fermi gas in two

stabilized by the symmetry of the single-particle spectrum under spin-orbit
coupling, and is therefore {\it universal} against the short-range details of
the interaction potential. When the Fermi energy increases, we show that the
trimer is further stabilized by particle-hole fluctuations over a considerable
parameter region. We map out the phase diagram consisting of trimers, dimers,
and polarons, and discuss the detection of these states using radio-frequency

manifestation of intriguing three-body correlations emerging from a many-body
environment, which, in our case, is cooperatively supported by the
single-particle spectral symmetry and the collective particle-hole excitations.

$\Lambda_{\textrm{c}} / \Lambda_{\textrm{s}}$ is a quotient group that can be
used to form a (nested) lattice code $\mathcal{C}$. Conway and Sloane's method
of encoding and indexing does not apply when the lattices are not self-similar.
Results are provided for two classes of lattices. (1) If $\Lambda_{\textrm{c}}$

then encoding is always possible. (2) When $\Lambda_{\textrm{c}}$ and
$\Lambda_{\textrm{s}}$ are described by full generator matrices, if a solution
to a linear diophantine equation exists, then encoding is possible. In
addition, special cases where $\mathcal{C}$ is a cyclic code are also
considered. A condition for the existence of a group homomorphism between the

of coding lattices, including Construction A, Construction D and LDLCs. The

selecting $\Lambda_{\textrm{c}}$ and $\Lambda_{\textrm{s}}$ separately,
avoiding competing design requirements of self-similar lattice codes.

fitting a Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) to the prior ensemble. Using the data
likelihood function, the posterior density is then formulated as a mixture

developed herein is named ""cluster HMC sampling filter"" (ClHMC). A multi-chain

relations have important implications for astrophysics and gravitational-wave
astronomy. An interesting problem is whether similar relations hold for other
compact objects and how they approach the black-hole limit. To answer these
questions, here we investigate the deformation properties of a large class of
thin-shell gravastars, which are exotic compact objects that do not possess an
event horizon nor a spacetime singularity. Working in a small-spin and
small-tidal field expansion, we calculate the moment of inertia, the quadrupole
moment, and the (quadrupolar electric) tidal Love number of gravastars with a
polytropic thin shell. The I-Love-Q relations of a thin-shell gravastar are
drastically different from those of an ordinary neutron star. The Love number
and quadrupole moment are negative for less compact models and the I-Love-Q
relations continuously approach the black-hole limit. We consider a variety of
polytropic equations of state for the matter shell, and find no universality in
the I-Love-Q relations. However, we cannot deny the possibility that, similarly
to the neutron-star case, an approximate universality might emerge for a
limited class of equations of state. Finally, we discuss how a measurement of

molecules in the upper atmosphere of Mars produced in reactions of thermal
molecular hydrogen and energetic oxygen atoms. Two major sources of energetic O
considered are the photochemical production, via dissociative recombination of
O$_{2}^{+}$ ions, and energizing collisions with fast atoms produced by the
precipitating Solar Wind (SW) ions, mostly H$^+$ and He$^{2+}$, and energetic
neutral atoms (ENAs) originating in the charge-exchange collisions between the
SW ions and atmospheric gases. Energizing collisions of O with atmospheric
secondary hot atoms, induced by precipitating SW ions and ENAs, are also
included in our consideration. The non-thermal reaction O + H$_2(v,j)
\rightarrow$ H + OH$(v',j')$ is described using recent quantum-mechanical
state-to-state cross sections, which allow us to predict non-equilibrium
distributions of excited rotational and vibrational states $(v',j')$ of OH and
expected emission spectra. A fraction of produced translationally hot OH is
sufficiently energetic to overcome Mars' gravitational potential and escape
into space, contributing to the hot corona. We estimate the total escape flux
from dayside of Mars for low solar activity conditions at about
$5\times10^{22}$ s$^{-1}$, or about 0.1\% of the total escape rate of atomic O
and H. The described non-thermal OH production mechanism is general and
expected to contribute to the evolution of atmospheres of the planets,
satellites, and exoplanets with similar atmospheric compositions.

45-m/FOREST $^{13}$CO ($J$=1--0) maps. The spectra show prominent features due
to polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) at wavelengths of 6.2, 7.7, 8.6,
11.3, 12.0, 12.7, 13.5, and 14.2 $\mu$m. We find that the PAH emission features
are bright in the region between the HII region traced by Br$\gamma$ and the
molecular cloud traced by $^{13}$CO, supporting that the PAH emission
originates mostly from photo-dissociation regions. Based on the
spatially-resolved $Spitzer$/IRS maps, we examine spatial variations of the PAH
properties in detail. As a result, we find that the interband ratio of PAH 7.7
$\mu$m/PAH 11.3 $\mu$m varies locally near M17SW, but rather independently of
the distance from the OB stars in M17, suggesting that the degree of PAH
ionization is mainly controlled by local conditions rather than the global UV
environments determined by the OB stars in M17. We also find that the interband
ratios of the PAH 12.0 $\mu$m, 12.7 $\mu$m, 13.5 $\mu$m, and 14.2 $\mu$m
features to the PAH 11.3 $\mu$m feature are high near the M17 center, which
suggests structural changes of PAHs through processing due to intense UV
radiation, producing abundant edgy irregular PAHs near the M17 center.

searches. Nonetheless, the statistics of frequency of low-mass planets hosted
by low mass stars remains poorly constrained. Aims. Our M-dwarf radial velocity
monitoring with HARPS-N can provide a major contribution to the widening of the
current statistics through the in-depth analysis of accurate radial velocity
observations in a narrow range of spectral sub-types (79 stars, between dM0 to
dM3). Spectral accuracy will enable us to reach the precision needed to detect
small planets with a few earth masses. Our survey will bring a contribute to
the surveys devoted to the search for planets around M-dwarfs, mainly focused
on the M-dwarf population of the northern emisphere, for which we will provide
an estimate of the planet occurence. Methods. We present here a long duration
radial velocity monitoring of the M1 dwarf star GJ 3998 with HARPS-N to
identify periodic signals in the data. Almost simultaneous photometric
observations were carried out within the APACHE and EXORAP programs to
characterize the stellar activity and to distinguish from the periodic signals
those due to activity and to the presence of planetary companions. Results. The
radial velocities have a dispersion in excess of their internal errors due to
at least four superimposed signals, with periods of 30.7, 13.7, 42.5 and 2.65
days. The analysis of spectral indices based on Ca II H & K and Halpha lines
demonstrates that the periods of 30.7 and 42.5 days are due to chromospheric
inhomogeneities modulated by stellar rotation and differential rotation. The
shorter periods of 13.74 +/- 0.02 d and 2.6498 +/- 0.0008 d are well explained
with the presence of two planets, with minimum masses of 6.26 +/- 0.79 MEarth

uniquely defined as it takes different values for different boundary conditions

counterparts. Also, the approach to the thermodynamic limit follows a different
scaling: inversely proportional to the logaritm of the system size for buckled
materials, rather than the usual power-law approach. In graphene samples of
$\sim 1000$ atoms, different boundary conditions can cause differences
exceeding 10 eV. Besides presenting numerical evidence in simulations, we show
that the universal features in this behavior can be understood with simple
bead-spring models. Fundamentally, our findings imply that it is necessary to
specify the boundary conditions for the energy of the lattice defects in the

the lack of agreement in the reported values of formation energies in graphene.

the use of few interaction terms. It then represents a first step toward the

transport of particle and entropy. We review in particular the comparison
between theoretically predited and experimentally observed thermoelectric
effects in such systems. We also show how combining well designed transport
properties and evaporative cooling leads to an equivalent of the Peltier effect
with cold atoms, which can be used as a new cooling procedure with improved
cooling power and efficiency compared to the evaporative cooling currently used
in atomic gases. This could lead to a new generation of experiments probing
strong correlation effects of ultracold fermionic atoms at low temperatures.

as host materials to condensed matter physics counterparts of Dirac and Weyl
fermions originally proposed in high energy physics. These fermions with linear
dispersions near the Dirac or Weyl points obey Lorentz invariance, and the
chiral anomaly leads to novel quantum phenomena such as negative
magnetoresistance. The Lorentz invariance is, however, not necessarily
respected in condensed matter physics, and thus Lorentz-violating type-II Dirac
fermions with strongly tilted cones can be realized in topological semimetals.
Here, we report the first experimental evidence of type-II Dirac fermions in
bulk stoichiometric PtTe$_2$ single crystal. Angle-resolved photoemission
spectroscopy (ARPES) measurements and first-principles calculations reveal a
pair of strongly tilted Dirac cones along the $\Gamma$-A direction under the
symmetry protection, confirming PtTe$_2$ as a type-II Dirac semimetal. The
realization of type-II Dirac fermions opens a new door for exotic physical
properties distinguished from type-I Dirac fermions in condensed matter
materials.

spatial information of the atom in 3D space is obtained via upper-level

cope with dynamically changing requirements and emergent behaviors. The
emphasis on system reconfigurability has not been followed by an adequate
research effort, and the current state of the art lacks logics and model

seen to change character on lowering the temperature: The strong oscillations

long range attractive tail emerges leading to a scaling form which agrees with
the expectations based on the critical Casimir effect. Strong corrections to

of the clumps decreases with increasing distance, while the velocity is
approximately constant. Therefore, both the momentum and kinetic energy of the
clumps decrease outwards. In the innermost (~100 pc) part of the outflow, we
measure a hot-to-cold molecular gas ratio of 7x10^-5, which is similar to that
measured in other resolved molecular outflows. We do not find evidence of an
ionized phase in this outflow. The nuclear IR and radio properties are
compatible with strong and highly obscured star-formation (A_k ~ 4.6 mag;
SFR~15 Msun/yr). We do not find any evidence for the presence of an active
galactic nucleus. We estimate that supernova explosions in the nuclear
starburst (\nu(SN) ~ 0.2 yr^-1) can power the observed molecular outflow. The
kinetic energy and radial momentum of the cold molecular phase of the outflow
correspond to about 2% and 20%, respectively, of the supernovae output. The
cold molecular outflow velocity is lower than the escape velocity, so the gas
will likely return to the galaxy disk. The mass loading factor is ~0.1-0.5, so
the negative feedback due to this star-formation powered molecular outflow is
probably limited.

generally assumed that the entities executing distributed algorithms are
altruistic. However, in various scenarios, the value of the output produced by
an entity may have a tremendous impact on its future. This is for instance the
case of tasks such as computing maximal independent sets (MIS) in networks.
Indeed, a node belonging to the MIS may be later asked more than to a node not
in the MIS, e.g., because MIS in networks are often used as backbones to
collect, transfer, and broadcast information, which is costly. In this paper,
we revisit typical local distributed network computing tasks in the framework
of algorithmic game theory. Specifically, we focus on the construction of
solutions for locally checkable labeling (LCL) tasks, which form a large class
of distributed tasks, including MIS, coloring, maximal matching, etc., and
which have been studied for more than 20 years in distributed computing.
  Given an LCL task, the nodes are collectively aiming at computing a solution,
but, at the individual level, every node plays rationally and selfishly with
the objective of optimizing its own profit. Surprisingly, the classical
frameworks for game theory are not fully appropriate for the purpose of our
study. Moreover, we show that classical notions like Nash equilibria may yield
algorithms requiring an arbitrarily large number of rounds to converge.
Nevertheless, by extending and generalizing core results from game theory, we
establish the existence of a so-called trembling-hand perfect equilibria, a
subset of Nash equilibria that is well suited to LCL construction tasks. The
main outcome of the paper is therefore that, for essentially all distributed
tasks whose solutions are locally checkable, there exist construction
algorithms which are robust to selfishness.

data acquired using small telescopes limit the technique to the follow-up of
hot Jupiters. However, space-based missions such as Kepler and CoRoT have
already revealed that hot Jupiters are mainly found in single systems. Thus, it
is natural to question ourselves if we are properly using the observing time at
hand carrying out such follow-ups, or if the use of medium-to-low quality
transit light curves, combined with current standard techniques of data
analysis, could be playing a main role against exoplanetary search via TTVs.
The purpose of this work is to investigate to what extent ground-based
observations treated with current modelling techniques are reliable to detect
and characterize additional planets in already known planetary systems. To meet
this goal, we simulated typical primary transit observations of a hot Jupiter
mimicing an existing system, Qatar-1. To resemble ground-based observations we
attempt to reproduce, by means of physically and empirically motivated
relationships, the effects caused by the Earth's atmosphere and the
instrumental setup on the synthetic light curves. Therefore, the synthetic data
present different photometric quality and transit coverage. In addition, we
introduced a perturbation in the mid-transit times of the hot Jupiter, caused
by an Earth-sized planet in a 3:2 mean motion resonance. Analyzing the
synthetic light curves produced after certain epochs, we attempt to recover the
synthetically added TTV signal by means of usual primary transit fitting

contracts are derived by the MNO in a way to maximize the global benefit of the
CPs and prevent them from using their private information to manipulate the
outcome of the caching process. For this interdependent contract model, the
closed-form expressions of the price and the allocated storage space to each CP
are derived. This proposed mechanism is shown to satisfy the sufficient and
necessary conditions for the feasibility of a contract. Moreover, it is shown
that the proposed pricing model is budget balanced, enabling the MNO to cover
all the caching expenses via the prices charged to the CPs. Simulation results
show that none of the CPs will have an incentive to choose a contract designed
for CPs with different traffic loads.

H{\alpha} and the Na I D lines. Applying differential spectrophotometry methods
to the Ca II H and Ca II K lines combined, using respective passband widths of
$\Delta\lambda$ = 0.4 & 0.6 \AA\ yields excess absorption of t$_d$ = 0.0074
$\pm$ 0.0044 (1.7$\sigma$; Transit 1) and 0.0214 +/- 0.0022 (9.8$\sigma$;
Transit 2). Similarly, we detect excess H{\alpha} absorption in a passband of
width $\Delta\lambda$ = 0.7 \AA, with t$_d$ = 0.0084 $\pm$ 0.0016 (5.2$\sigma$)
and 0.0121 $\pm$ 0.0012 (9.9$\sigma$). For both lines, Transit 2 is thus
significantly deeper. Combining all three transits for the Na I D lines yields
excess absorption of t$_d$ = 0.0041 $\pm$ 0.0006 (6.5$\sigma$). By considering
the time series observations of each line, we find that the excess apparent
absorption is best recovered in the stellar reference frame. These findings
lead us to postulate that the main contribution to the excess transit
absorption in the differential light curves arises because the normalising
continuum bands form in the photosphere, whereas the line cores contain a
chromospheric component. We can not rule out that part of the excess absorption
signature arises from the planetary atmosphere, but we present evidence which
casts doubt on recent claims to have detected wind motions in the planet's

controlled by the illumination bandwidth and geometry. As generic example we
study the modifications inter-particle forces within a 1D chain of atoms

recordings that allow one to investigate how different brain areas interact.
One particular class of methods, based on the linear parametric representation
of multiple interacting time series, is widely used to study causal
connectivity in the brain. However, the results obtained by these methods
should be interpreted with great care. The goal of this paper is to show, both
theoretically and using simulations, that results obtained by applying causal
connectivity measures on the sensor (scalp) time series do not allow
interpretation in terms of interacting brain sources. This is because 1) the
channel locations cannot be seen as an approximation of a source's anatomical
location and 2) spurious connectivity can occur between sensors. Although many
measures of causal connectivity derived from EEG sensor time series are
affected by the latter, here we will focus on the well-known time domain index
of Granger causality (GC) and on the frequency domain directed transfer
function (DTF). Using the state-space framework and designing two simulation
studies we show that mixing effects caused by volume conduction can lead to
spurious connections, detected either by time domain GC or by DTF. Therefore,
GC/DTF causal connectivity measures should be computed at the source level, or
derived within analysis frameworks that model the effects of volume conduction.
Since mixing effects can also occur in the source space, it is advised to
combine source space analysis with connectivity measures that are robust to
mixing.

the map between classical Poisson brackets and their associated commutators,
such schemes give rise to quantum states obeying canonical dispersion
relations, obtained by substituting the de Broglie relations into the relevant
(classical) energy-momentum relation. In canonical QM, this yields a dispersion
relation involving $\hbar$ but not $c$, whereas the canonical relativistic
dispersion relation involves both. Extending this logic to the canonical
quantization of the gravitational field gives rise to loop quantum gravity, and
a map between classical variables containing $G$ and $c$, and associated
commutators involving $\hbar$. This naturally defines a ""wave-gravity duality"",
suggesting that a quantum wave packet describing {\it self-gravitating matter}
obeys a dispersion relation involving $G$, $c$ and $\hbar$. We propose an
ansatz for this relation, which is valid in the semi-Newtonian regime of both
QM and general relativity. In this limit, space and time are absolute, but
imposing $v_{\rm max} = c$ allows us to recover the standard expressions for
the Compton wavelength $\lambda_C$ and the Schwarzschild radius $r_S$ within
the same ontological framework. The new dispersion relation is based on
""extended"" de Broglie relations, which remain valid for slow-moving bodies of
{\it any} mass $m$. These reduce to canonical form for $m \ll m_P$, yielding
$\lambda_C$ from the standard uncertainty principle, whereas, for $m \gg m_P$,
we obtain $r_S$ as the natural radius of a self-gravitating quantum object.
Thus, the extended de Broglie theory naturally gives rise to a unified
description of black holes and fundamental particles in the semi-Newtonian
regime.

quantified by the epidemic threshold of the
susceptible-infectious-recovered-susceptible model for the propagation of
communicable diseases, i.e. the critical value of disease transmissibility
above which the disease turns endemic. We verify for both synthetic and
empirical data of human interactions that the use of incomplete data sets due
to spatial sampling leads to the underestimation of the epidemic risk. The bias
is however smaller than the one obtained by uniformly sampling the same
fraction of contacts: it depends nonlinearly on the fraction of contacts that
are recorded and becomes negligible if this fraction is large enough. Moreover,
it depends on the interplay between the timescales of population and spreading
dynamics.

an X-ray luminosity of $2\times10^{36}$ erg s$^{-1}$ and revealed the presence
of a narrow dip-like feature in its pulse profile that was never reported

inferred from the Suzaku observation carried out in 2007 that the

escaping from the expanding shock-heated progenitor envelope. For polytropic
Hydrogen envelopes, the properties of the emitted radiation are described by
simple analytic expressions and are nearly independent of the polytropic index,
$n$. This analytic description holds at early time, $t<$~few days, during which
radiation escapes from shells initially lying near the stellar surface. We use
numerical solutions to address two issues. First, we show that the analytic
description holds at early time also for non-polytropic density profiles.
Second, we extend the solutions to later times, when the emission emerges from
deep within the envelope and depends on the progenitor's density profile.
Examining the late time behavior of polytropic envelopes with a wide range of
core to envelope mass and radius ratios, $0.1\le M_{\rm c}/M_{\rm env}\le10$
and $10^{-3}\le R_{\rm c}/R\le10^{-1}$, we find that the effective temperature
is well described by the analytic solution also at late time, while the
luminosity $L$ is suppressed by a factor, which may be approximated to better
than $20[30]\%$ accuracy up to $t=t_{\rm tr}/a$ by $A\exp[-(at/t_{\rm
tr})^\alpha]$ with $t_{\rm tr} = 15 (M_{\rm env}/M_\odot)^{3/4}(E/10^{51}{\rm

of a fully ionized gas, i.e. for $T>0.7~\rm eV$, $t<14(R/10^{13.5}{\rm

We determine a critical gas density above which the recombination of electrons
and ions on the grain surface dominates over the gas-phase recombination. For
this regime, we present a self-consistent analytical model which allows us to
exactly calculate abundances of charged species in dusty gas, without making
assumptions on the grain charge distribution. To demonstrate the importance of
the proposed approach, we check whether the conventional approximation of low
grain charges is valid for typical protoplanetary disks, and discuss the
implications for dust coagulation and development of the ""dead zone"" in the
disk. The presented model is applicable for arbitrary grain-size distributions
and, for given dust properties and conditions of the disk, has only one free
parameter - the effective mass of the ions, shown to have a low effect on
results. The model can be easily included in numerical simulations following
the dust evolution in dense molecular clouds and protoplanetary disks.

different perspective other than the $P-v$ criticality and the $q-U$

point correlation function but also the entanglement entropy of dilaton AdS
black holes. We achieve this goal by solving the equation of motion constrained
by the boundary condition numerically and we concentrate on $\delta L$ and
$\delta S$ which have been regularized by subtracting the terms in pure AdS
with the same boundary region. For both the two point correlation function and
the entanglement entropy, we consider $4\times2\times2=16$ cases due to
different choices of parameters. The van der Waals like behavior can be clearly
witnessed from all the $T-\delta L$ ($T-\delta S$) graphs for $q<q_c$.
Moreover, the effects of dilaton gravity and the spacetime dimensionality on
the phase structure of dilaton AdS black holes are disclosed. Furthermore, we
discuss the stability of dilaton AdS black holes by applying the analogous
specific heat definition and remove the unstable branch by introducing a bar
$T=T_*$. It is shown that the first order phase transition temperature $T_*$ is
affected by both $\alpha$ and $n$. The analogous equal area laws for both the
$T-\delta L$ graph and the $T-\delta S$ graph are examined numerically. The
relative errors for all the cases are small enough that we can safely conclude
that the analogous equal area laws hold for $T-\delta L$ ($T-\delta S$) graph
of dilaton AdS black holes.

Jacobi iterative method to solve linear systems of equations ($Au=b$)
associated with elliptic problems. It inherits its robustness and accelerates
its convergence rate computing a set of $P$ relaxation factors that result from
a minimization problem. In a typical SRJ scheme, the former set of factors is
employed in cycles of $M$ consecutive iterations until a prescribed tolerance
is reached. We present the analytic form for the optimal set of relaxation
factors for the case in which all of them are different, and find that the
resulting algorithm is equivalent to a non-stationary generalized Richardson's
method. Our method to estimate the weights has the advantage that the explicit
computation of the maximum and minimum eigenvalues of the matrix $A$ is
replaced by the (much easier) calculation of the maximum and minimum
frequencies derived from a von Neumann analysis. This set of weights is also
optimal for the general problem, resulting in the fastest convergence of all
possible SRJ schemes for a given grid structure. We also show that with the set
of weights computed for the optimal SRJ scheme for a fixed cycle size it is
possible to estimate numerically the optimal value of the parameter $\omega$ in
the Successive Overtaxation (SOR) method in some cases. Finally, we demonstrate
with practical examples that our method also works very well for Poisson-like
problems in which a high-order discretization of the Laplacian operator is
employed. This is of interest since the former discretizations do not yield
consistently ordered $A$ matrices. Furthermore, the optimal SRJ schemes here
deduced, are advantageous over existing SOR implementations for high-order
discretizations of the Laplacian operator in as much as they do not need to
resort to multi-coloring schemes for their parallel implementation. (abridged)

been introduced. Here, we compare three common FSA models to each other and to
the HME using the recently-developed boundary tracking algorithms. The three
FSA models are the cubic-quintic model, the sinusoidal model, and the algebraic
model. We find that all three models predict the existence of a stable
high-energy solution that is not present in the HME and have a much larger

the analysis of the switching currents, i.e. the current at which a finite

a trapped state (the zero voltage solution) to a running state (the finite
voltage solution). In this context, we investigate the probability distribution
of the Josephson junctions switching current taking into account the effect of
the bias sweeping rate and introducing a simple nonideal quantum measurements
scheme. The measurements are modelled as repeated voltage samplings at discrete
time intervals, that is with repeated projections of the time dependent quantum
solutions on the static or the running states, to retrieve the probability
distribution of the switching currents. The distribution appears to be immune
of the quantum Zeno effect, and it is close to, but distinguishable from, the
Wentzel-Kramers-Brillouin approximation. For energy barriers comparable to the
quantum fundamental energy state and in the fast bias current ramp rate the
difference is neat, and remains sizeable in the asymptotic slow rate limit.
This behaviour is a consequence of the quantum character of the system that
confirms the presence of a backreaction of quantum measurements on the outcome

effective thermal quench lacks the coherent structures and the Kolmogorov
scaling; these properties are typical of both ordinary classical fluids and of
superfluid helium when driven by grids or propellers. Instead, thermal quench
turbulence has properties akin to a random flow, more similar to another
turbulent regime called ultra-quantum turbulence which has been observed in
superfluid helium.

solid particles is studied numerically with Direct Numerical Simulations (DNS).
A simplified reaction system is used, where the solid-fluid reaction is
represented by a single isothermal reaction step. It is found that, due to the
clustering of particles by the isotropic turbulence, the overall reaction rate
is entirely controlled by the turbulence for large Damk\""ohler numbers. The
particle clustering significantly slows down the reaction rate for increasing
Damk\""ohler numbers which reaches an asymptotic limit that can be analytically
derived. This implies that the effect of turbulence on heterogeneously reacting
particles should be included in models that are used in CFD simulations of e.g.
char burnout in combustors or gasifiers. Such a model, based on the chemical
and turbulent time scales, is here proposed for the heterogeneous reaction rate
in the presence of turbulence.

(BH) consists of highly excited, long, closed, interacting strings and, as
such, can be modeled as a collapsed polymer. It was previously shown that the
scaling relations of the collapsed-polymer model agree with those of the BH.
The current paper further substantiates this proposal with an investigation
into some of its dynamical consequences. In particular, we show that the model
predicts, without relying on gravitational effects, an emergent horizon. We
further show that the horizon fluctuates quantum mechanically as it should and
that the strength of the fluctuations is inversely proportional to the BH
entropy. It is then demonstrated that the emission of Hawking radiation is
realized microscopically by the quantum-induced escape of small pieces of
string, with the rate of escape and the energy per emitted piece both
parametrically matching the Hawking temperature. We also show, using standard
methods from statistical mechanics and chaos theory, how our model accounts for
some other known properties of BHs. These include the accepted results for the
scrambling time and the viscosity-to-entropy ratio, which in our model apply
not only at the horizon but throughout the BH interior.

distributed fashion. Such games and their strategies have been formalised in
concurrent games based on event structures. However there are limitations in
founding strategies on traditional event structures. Sometimes a probabilistic
distributed strategy relies on certain benign races where, intuitively, several
members of team Player may race each other to make a common move. Although
there are event structures which support such parallel causes, in which an
event is enabled in several compatible ways, they do not support an operation
of hiding central to the composition of strategies; nor do they support
probability adequately. An extension of traditional event structures is devised
which supports parallel causes and hiding, as well as the mix of probability
and nondeterminism needed to account for probabilistic distributed strategies.
The extension is tested in the construction of a bicategory of probabilistic
distributed strategies with parallel causes. The bicategory is rich in
operations relevant to probabilistic as well as deterministic parallel

such as water or carbon monoxide, reaches its condensation temperature.
Snow-lines play a crucial role in disk evolution by promoting the rapid growth
of ice-covered grains. Signatures of the carbon monoxide snow-line (at
temperatures of around 20 kelvin) have recently been imaged in the disks
surrounding the pre-main-sequence stars TW Hydra and HD163296, at distances of
about 30 astronomical units (au) from the star. But the water snow-line of a
protoplanetary disk (at temperatures of more than 100 kelvin) has not hitherto
been seen, as it generally lies very close to the star (less than 5 au away for
solar-type stars). Water-ice is important because it regulates the efficiency
of dust and planetesimal coagulation, and the formation of comets, ice giants
and the cores of gas giants. Here we report ALMA images at 0.03-arcsec
resolution (12 au) of the protoplanetary disk around V883 Ori, a protostar of
1.3 solar masses that is undergoing an outburst in luminosity arising from a
temporary increase in the accretion rate. We find an intensity break
corresponding to an abrupt change in the optical depth at about 42 au, where
the elevated disk temperature approaches the condensation point of water, from
which we conclude that the outburst has moved the water snow-line. The spectral
behaviour across the snow-line confirms recent model predictions: dust
fragmentation and the inhibition of grain growth at higher temperatures results
in soaring grain number densities and optical depths. As most planetary systems
are expected to experience outbursts caused by accretion during their formation
our results imply that highly dynamical water snow-lines must be considered
when developing models of disk evolution and planet formation.

is removed when T2HK and HK are added together. With T2HK+HK (DUNE), the
neutrino mass hierarchy can be determined at least at $ 5 \sigma$ (8 $\sigma$)
C.L. for any value of true $\delta_{CP}$. With T2HK+HK+DUNE the significance of
the mass hierarchy increases to almost 15 $\sigma$ for the unfavorable value of
$\delta_{CP}$. For these combined setup, octant can be resolved except
$43.5^\circ < \theta_{23} < 48^\circ$ at $5\sigma$ C.L for both the hierarchies
irrespective of the value of $\delta_{CP}$. The significance of CP violation is
around 10 $\sigma$ C.L. for $\delta_{CP} \sim \pm 90^\circ$. Apart from that
these combined facility has the capability to discover CP violation for at
least $68\%$ fraction of the true $\delta_{CP}$ values at $5 \sigma$ for any

OP and/or exhibit skyrmionic character in the \textit{relative} OP space, all
obtained as a self-consistent solution of the microscopic Bogoliubov-de Gennes
equations. We reveal the link between the local density of states (LDOS) of the
novel topological states and the behavior of the chiral domain wall between the
OP components, enabling direct identification of those states in scanning
tunneling microscopy. For example, a skyrmion always contains a closed chiral
domain wall, which is found to be mapped exactly by zero-bias peaks in LDOS.
Moreover, the LDOS exhibits electron-hole asymmetry, which is different from
the LDOS of conventional vortex states with the same vorticity. Finally, we
present the magnetic field and temperature dependence of the properties of a
skyrmion, indicating that this topological defect can be surprisingly large in
size, and can be pinned by an artificially indented non-superconducting closed
path in the sample. These features are expected to facilitate the experimental
observation of skyrmionic states, thereby enabling experimental verification of
chirality in emerging superconducting materials.

of solar-like oscillating stars, based on oscillation frequencies. In
derivation of these relations, it is assumed that the first adiabatic exponent
at the surface (Gamma_1s) of such stars is constant. However, by constructing
interior models for the mass range 0.8-1.6 Msun, we show that Gamma_1s is not
constant at stellar surfaces for the effective temperature range with which we
deal. Furthermore, the well-known relation between large separation and mean
density also depends on Gamma_1s. Such knowledge is the basis for our aim of
modifying scaling relations. There are significant differences between masses
and radii found from modified and conventional scaling relations. However,
comparison of predictions of these relations with the non-asteroseismic
observations of Procyon A reveals that new scaling relations are effective in
determining the mass and radius of stars. In the present study, solar-like
oscillation frequencies of 89 target stars (mostly Kepler and CoRoT) were
analysed. As well as two new reference frequencies (nu_min1 and nu_min2) found
in the spacing of solar-like oscillation frequencies of stellar interior
models, we also take into account nu_min0. In addition to the frequency of
maximum amplitude, these frequencies have very strong diagnostic potential for
determination of fundamental properties. The present study involves the
application of derived relations from the models to the solar-like oscillating
stars, and computes their effective temperatures using purely asteroseismic
methods. There are in general very close agreements between effective
temperatures from asteroseismic and non-asteroseismic (spectral and
photometric) methods. For the Sun and Procyon A, for example, the agreement is
almost total.

increase the impedance of the light mode enabling ultrastrong coupling to a

problem in the field of network design. Given an undirected tree $G=(V,E)$, an
additional set of edges $L \subseteq V\times V$ disjoint from $E$ called
\textit{links}, and a cost vector $c\in \mathbb{R}_{\geq 0}^L$, WTAP asks to
find a minimum-cost set $F\subseteq L$ with the property that $(V,E\cup F)$ is
$2$-edge connected. The special case where $c_\ell = 1$ for all $\ell\in L$ is
called the Tree Augmentation Problem (TAP). Both problems are known to be
NP-hard.
  For the class of bounded cost vectors, we present a first improved
approximation algorithm for WTAP since more than three decades. Concretely, for
any $M\in \mathbb{Z}_{\geq 1}$ and $\epsilon > 0,$ we present an LP based
$(\delta+\epsilon)$-approximation for WTAP restricted to cost vectors $c$ in

this factor to $\frac{5}{3}+\epsilon$.
  Our results rely on a new LP, that significantly differs from existing LPs

phases. The first phase uses the fractional solution to decompose the tree and
its fractional solution into so-called $\beta$-simple pairs losing only an
$\epsilon$-factor in the objective function. We then show how to use the
additional constraints in our LP combined with the $\beta$-simple structure to
round a fractional solution in each part of the decomposition.

the properties of the composite biological materials. As living organisms
usually encounter complex ambient conditions like water, pH and ions are
critical factors towards the structural integrity of biomaterials. It is
therefore essential to study the chitin-protein interface under different
environmental conditions. Here, an atomistic model consisting of a chitin
substrate and a protein filament is constructed, which is regarded as a
representative of the chitin-protein interface existing in many chitin-based
biomaterials. Based on this model, the mechanical properties of chitin-protein
interface under different moisture and pH values are investigated through
molecular dynamics simulations. The results reveal a weakening effect of water
towards the chitin-protein interface, as well as acidity, i.e. the protonated
protein forms a stronger adhesion to chitin than that in the alkaline
environment. In addition, the effect from side-chain of protein is studied and
it is found that certain kinds of amino acid can form hydrophobic connections
to chitin surface, which means that these peptides partly dodge the weakening
effect of water. Our observation indicates that terminuses and side-chains in
protein are of importance in forming interfacial hydrogen bonds. From our full
atomistic models, we can observe some molecular mechanisms about how protein
interacts with chitin in different conditions, which may spotlight the
engineering on biomaterials with similar interfaces.

suggested framework, first, decomposes the fMRI signal into various frequency
subbands using wavelet transforms. Then, a brain network, called mesh network,
is formed at each subband by ensembling a set of local meshes. The locality
around each anatomic region is defined with respect to a neighborhood system
based on functional connectivity. The arc weights of a mesh are estimated by
ridge regression formed among the average region time series. In the final
step, the adjacency matrices of mesh networks obtained at different subbands
are ensembled for brain decoding under a hierarchical learning architecture,
called, fuzzy stacked generalization (FSG). Our results on Human Connectome
Project task-fMRI dataset reflect that the suggested HMMN model can
successfully discriminate tasks by extracting complementary information
obtained from mesh arc weights of multiple subbands. We study the topological
properties of the mesh networks at different resolutions using the network
measures, namely, node degree, node strength, betweenness centrality and global
efficiency; and investigate the connectivity of anatomic regions, during a

have been proposed in the past for the purpose of accurately reflecting various
realistic network situations, with extra connectivity being one such
conditional connectivity. In this paper, we will use isoperimetric properties
of the hypercube network to obtain its extra connectivity. The result of the
paper for the first time establishes a relationship between the age-old
isoperimetric problem and network connectivity.

represented by polytopes. Due to the degrees of invariance of surfaces and that
of freedom of joints, these operand polytopes are originally unbounded in most
of the cases (i.e. polyhedra). Homri et al. proposed the introduction of
virtual boundaries (called cap half-spaces) over the unbounded displacements of
each polyhedron to turn them into 6-polytopes. This decision was motivated by
the complexity that operating on polyhedra in R6 supposes. However, that
strategy has to face the multiplication of the number of cap half-spaces during
the computation of Minkowski sums. In general, the time for computing cap
facets is greater than for computing facets representing real limits of bounded
displacements. In order to deal with that, this paper proposes the use of the
theory of screws to determine the set of displacements that defines the
positioning of one surface in relation to another. This set of displacements
defines the subspace of R6 in which the polytopes of the respective surfaces
have to be projected and operated to avoid calculating facets and vertices
along the directions of unbounded displacements. With this new strategy it is
possible to decrease the complexity of the Minkowski sums by reducing the
dimension of the operands and consequently reducing the computation time. An
example illustrates the method and shows the time reduction during the
computations.

special relativity. Imposing covariance of the gravitational force with respect
to the Lorentz transformations, we show from a thought experiment that a
magnetic-like force must be present whenever two or more bodies are in motion.
The exact expression for this gravitomagnetic force is then derived purely from
special relativity and the consequences of such a covariant theory are
developed. For instance, we show that the gravitomagnetic fields satisfy a
system of differential equations similar to the Maxwell equations of
electrodynamics. This implies that the gravitational waves spread out with the
speed of light in a flat spacetime, which is in agreement with the recent
results concerning the gravitational waves detection. We also propose that the
vector potential can be associated with the interaction momentum in the same
way as the scalar potential is usually associated with the interaction energy.
Other topics are also discussed, for example, the transformation laws for the
fields, the energy and momentum stored in the gravitomagnetic fields, the
invariance of the gravitational mass and so on. We remark that is not our
intention here to propose an alternative theory of gravitation but, rather,
only a first approximation for the gravitational phenomena, so that it can be
applied whenever the gravitational force can be regarded as an ordinary
effective force field and special relativity can be used with safety. To make
this point clear we present briefly a comparison between our approach and that
based on the (linearized) Einstein's theory. Finally, we remark that although
we have assumed nothing from the electromagnetic theory, we found that gravity
and electricity share many properties in common - these similarities, in fact,
are just a requirement of special relativity that must apply to any physically

diagonalizable and has real discrete spectrum whereas the Hermitian
Schr{\""o}dinger Hamiltonian: $H=p^2/2\mu+V(x)$, may not be so. For instance
when $V(x)=x, x^3, -x^2$, $H$ does not have even one real discrete eigenvalue.
Textbooks do not highlight this distinction. However, if $H$ has real discrete
spectrum, by virtue of the expansion theorem, one can convert the eigenvalue
problem $H\psi_n=E_n \psi_n$ into a matrix and get eigenvalues $E_n$ by
diagonalizing the matrix. We show, that the thus obtained $E_n$ could be
accurate, provided $H$ is devoid of scattering states. We suggest that this
could be a simple and apt way to introduce the method of Linear Combination of
Atomic Orbitals (LCAO) for finding the spectra of molecules. In textbooks,
usually the method of matrix-diagonalization appears meagerly as a degenerate
perturbation theory for more than one dimensions.
