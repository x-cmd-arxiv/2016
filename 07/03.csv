modulations. We consider a tailored variational image registration problem that
is based on a physical distortion model and aims at minimizing the distance of
two oppositely distorted images subject to invertibility constraints. We follow
a discretize-then-optimize approach and present a novel face-staggered
discretization yielding a separable structure in the discretized distance
function and the invertibility constraints. The presence of a smoothness
regularizer renders the overall optimization problem non-separable, but we
present two optimization schemes that exploit the partial separability. First,
we derive a block-Jacobi preconditioner to be used in a Gauss-Newton-PCG
method. Second, we consider a splitting of the separable and non-separable part
and solve the resulting problem using the Alternating Direction Method of
Multipliers (ADMM). We provide a detailed convergence proof for ADMM for this
non-convex optimization problem. Both schemes are of essentially linear
complexity and are suitable for parallel computing. A considerable advantage of
the proposed schemes over established methods is the reduced time-to-solution.
In our numerical experiment using high-resolution 3D imaging data, our parallel
implementation of the ADMM method solves a 3D problem with more than 5 million
degrees of freedom in less than 50 seconds on a standard laptop, which is a
considerable improvement over existing methods.

instances of visual situations. A visual situation is an abstract
concept---e.g., ""a boxing match"", ""a birthday party"", ""walking the dog"",
""waiting for a bus""---whose image instantiations are linked more by their
common spatial and semantic structure than by low-level visual similarity. Our
system combines given and learned knowledge of the structure of a particular
situation, and adapts that knowledge to a new situation instance as it actively
searches for objects. More specifically, the system learns a set of probability
distributions describing spatial and other relationships among relevant
objects. The system uses those distributions to iteratively sample object
proposals on a test image, but also continually uses information from those
object proposals to adaptively modify the distributions based on what the
system has detected. We test our approach's ability to efficiently localize
objects, using a situation-specific image dataset created by our group. We
compare the results with several baselines and variations on our method, and
demonstrate the strong benefit of using situation knowledge and active
context-driven localization. Finally, we contrast our method with several other
approaches that use context as well as active search for object localization in
images.

manufactory a lot of money. The free material design can be formulated as an
optimization problem. However, due to its large scale, second-order methods
cannot solve the free material design problem in reasonable size. We formulate
the free material optimization (FMO) problem into a saddle-point form in which
the inverse of the stiffness matrix A(E) in the constraint is eliminated. The
size of A(E) is generally large, denoted as N by N. This is the first
formulation of FMO without A(E). We apply the primal-dual subgradient method
[17] to solve the restricted saddle-point formula. This is the first
gradient-type method for FMO. Each iteration of our algorithm takes a total of
$O(N^2)$ foating-point operations and an auxiliary vector storage of size O(N),
compared with formulations having the inverse of A(E) which requires $O(N^3)$
arithmetic operations and an auxiliary vector storage of size $O(N^2)$. To
solve the problem, we developed a closed-form solution to a semidefinite least
squares problem and an efficient parameter update scheme for the gradient
method, which are included in the appendix. We also approximate a solution to
the bounded Lagrangian dual problem. The problem is decomposed into small
problems each only having an unknown of k by k (k = 3 or 6) matrix, and can be
solved in parallel. The iteration bound of our algorithm is optimal for general

subject to communication constraints, due to quantization and the noise in the
communication channels from the processors to the estimator. We first derive
general lower bounds on the Bayes risk using information-theoretic quantities,
such as mutual information, information density, small ball probability, and
differential entropy. We then apply these lower bounds to the decentralized

information due to communication constraints. We treat the cases of a single
processor and of multiple processors, where the samples observed by different
processors may be conditionally dependent given the parameter, for
noninteractive and interactive communication protocols. Our results recover and
improve recent lower bounds on the Bayes risk and the minimax risk for certain
decentralized estimation problems, where previously only conditionally

our results provide a general way to quantify the degradation of estimation
performance caused by distributing resources to multiple processors, which is

the foundation of a broad range of quantum effects such as quantum Hall effects

systems, which often present exotic features, are particularly interesting.
While quantum systems are intrinsically linear due to the superposition
principle, nonlinear quantum mechanics can arise as an effective theory for
interacting systems (such as condensates of interacting bosons). Here we show
that gauge structures similar to curved spacetime can arise in nonlinear
quantum systems where the superposition principle breaks down. In the canonical
formalism of the nonlinear quantum mechanics, the geometric phases of quantum
evolutions can be formulated as the classical geometric phases of a harmonic
oscillator that represents the Bogoliubov excitations. We find that the
classical geometric phase can be described by a de Sitter universe. The
fundamental frequency of the harmonic oscillator plays the role of the cosmic
scale factor and the classical geometric phase is an integral of a differential
angle 2-form, which is half of the curvature 2-form of the associated de Sitter
universe. While the gauge structure of a linear quantum system presents
monopole singularity at energy level degeneracy points, nonlinear quantum
systems, corresponding to their quantum critical surfaces in the parameter
spaces, exhibits a conic singularity in their gauge structure, which mimics the
casual singularity at the big bang of the de Sitter universe. This finding
opens up a new approach to studying the gauge and topological structures of

unconventional fractional quantum Hall effect is plausible at filling factors
$\nu=$ 1/3 and 1/5, provided the interparticle interaction has an unusual form
for which the energy of two fermions in the relative angular momentum three
channel dominates. The interaction between composite fermions in the second
$\Lambda$ level (composite fermion analog of the electronic Landau level)
satisfies this property, and recent studies have supported unconventional
fractional quantum Hall effect of composite fermions at $\nu^*=$ 4/3 and 5/3,
which manifests as fractional quantum Hall effect of electrons at $\nu=$ 4/11,
4/13, 5/13, and 5/17. I investigate in this article the nature of the
fractional quantum Hall states at $\nu=$ 4/5, 5/7, 6/17, and 6/7, which
correspond to composite fermions at $\nu^*=$ 4/3, 5/3 and 6/5, and find that
all these fractional quantum Hall states are conventional. The underlying
reason is that the interaction between composite fermions depends substantially
on both the number and the direction of the vortices attached to the electrons.
I also study in detail the states with different spin polarizations at 6/17 and
6/7 and predict the critical Zeeman energies for the spin phase transitions
between them. I calculate the excitation gaps at 4/5, 5/7, 6/7, and 6/17 and
compare them against recent experiments.

  in a 1-D Hydrodynamic Model",,,,,"physics.ao-ph physics.data-an physics.flu-dyn","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Data assimilation has been applied to coastal hydrodynamic models to better
estimate system states or parameters by incorporating observed data into the
model. Kalman Filter (KF) is one of the most studied data assimilation methods
whose application is limited to linear systems. For nonlinear systems such as
hydrodynamic models a variation of the KF called Ensemble Kalman Filter (EnKF)
is applied to update the system state in the context of Monte Carlo simulation.
In this research, a dual EnKF approach is used to simultaneously estimate state
(water surface elevation) and parameters (bottom roughness and bathymetry) of
the shallow water models. The sensitivity of the filter to 1) the quantity and
precision of the observations, and 2) the initial estimation of parameters is
investigated in a 1-D shallow water problem located in the Gulf of Mexico.
Results show that starting from an initial estimate of bottom roughness and
bathymetry within a logical range and utilizing observations available at a
limited number of gages the dual EnKF is able to improve the bottom roughness
and bathymetry fields. The performance of the filter is sensitive to the
precision of measured data, especially in the case of estimating Mannings n and
bathymetry simultaneously.

features of the physics and chemistry of dense hydrogen. Using ab initio
molecular dynamics (AIMD), the classical superheating limit and melting line of
metallic hydrogen are investigated up to 1.5 TPa. The computations show that
the classical superheating degree is about 100 K, and the classical melting
curve becomes flat at a level of 350 K when beyond 500 GPa. This information
allows us to estimate the well depth and the potential barriers that must be
overcome when the crystal melts. Inclusion of nuclear quantum effects (NQE)
using path integral molecular dynamics (PIMD) predicts that both superheating
limit and melting temperature are lowered to below room temperature, but the
latter never reach absolute zero. Detailed analysis indicates that the melting
is thermally activated, rather than driven by pure zero-point motion (ZPM).
This argument was further supported by extensive PIMD simulations,
demonstrating the stability of Fddd structure against liquefaction at low

fractional joint transmission (JT) strategy is proposed, which divides each
transmission frame into two subframes. In the first subframe, one BS keeps
silent to store energy while the other transmits data, and then they perform
zero-forcing JT (ZF-JT) in the second subframe. We consider the average
sum-rate maximization problem by optimizing the energy allocation and the time
fraction of ZF-JT in two steps. Firstly, the sum-rate maximization for given
energy budget in each frame is analyzed. We prove that the optimal transmit
power can be derived in closed-form, and the optimal time fraction can be found
via bi-section search. Secondly, approximate dynamic programming (DP) algorithm
is introduced to determine the energy allocation among frames. We adopt a
linear approximation with the features associated with system states, and
determine the weights of features by simulation. We also operate the
approximation several times with random initial policy, named as policy
exploration, to broaden the policy search range. Numerical results show that
the proposed fractional JT greatly improves the performance. Also, appropriate

in neural machine translation need to spend substantial amount of their
capacity in disambiguating source and target words based on the context which

propose to contextualize the word embedding vectors using a nonlinear

represent special tokens (such as numbers, proper nouns and acronyms) with
typed symbols to facilitate translating those words that are not well-suited to

inner bar for certain orientations, and (4) rings of positive $h_4$ when viewed
at low inclinations. The most impressive of these features are the
$\sigma$-humps, these evolve with the inner bar, oscillating in strength just
as the inner bar does as it rotates relative to the outer bar. We show that, in
cylindrical coordinates, the inner bar has similar streaming motions and
velocity dispersion properties as normal large-scale bars, except for
$\sigma_z$, which exhibits peaks on the minor axis, i.e., humps. These

call the Drinfeld-Lafforgue-Vinberg degeneration VinBun_G. We construct local
models for the degeneration VinBun_G which ""factorize in families"" and use them
to study its singularities, generalizing results of the article [Sch1] which
was confined with the case G = SL_2.
  The multi-parameter degeneration VinBun_G gives rise to, for each parabolic
of G, a corresponding nearby cycles functor. Our main theorem expresses the
stalks of these nearby cycles in terms of the cohomology of the parabolic
Zastava spaces. From this description we deduce that the nearby cycles of
VinBun_G correspond, under the sheaf-function correspondence, to Bernstein's
asymptotics map on the level of functions. This had been speculated by
Bezrukavnikov-Kazhdan [BK] and Chen-Yom Din [CY] and conjectured in a precise
form by Sakellaridis [Sak2].

Tartakovsky and Veeravalli for general stochastic models assuming a certain
stability of the log-likelihood ratio process. Hidden Markov models represent a
wide class of stochastic processes that are very useful in a variety of

Shiryaev change-point detection rule for hidden Markov models. We propose a set
of regularity conditions under which the Shiryaev procedure is first-order
asymptotically optimal in a Bayesian context, minimizing moments of the
detection delay up to certain order asymptotically as the probability of false
alarm goes to zero. The developed theory for hidden Markov models is based on
Markov chain representation for the likelihood ratio and r-quick convergence
for Markov random walks. In addition, applying Markov nonlinear renewal theory,
we present a high-order asymptotic approximation for the expected delay to
detection of the Shiryaev detection rule. Asymptotic properties of another

that of classical transistors in production semiconductor fabrication. Actual
implementations of quantum computers will be susceptible to loss in the form of
physically faulty qubits. Though these physical faults must negatively affect
the computation, we can deal with them by adapting error correction schemes. In
this paper We have simulated statically placed single-fault lattices and
lattices with randomly placed faults at functional qubit yields of 80%, 90% and
95%, showing practical performance of a defective surface code by employing
actual circuit constructions and realistic errors on every gate, including
identity gates. We extend Stace et al.'s superplaquettes solution against
dynamic losses for the surface code to handle static losses such as physically
faulty qubits. The single-fault analysis shows that a static loss at the
periphery of the lattice has less negative effect than a static loss at the
center. The randomly-faulty analysis shows that 95% yield is good enough to
build a large scale quantum computer. The local gate error rate threshold is
$\sim 0.3\%$, and a code distance of seven suppresses the residual error rate
below the original error rate at $p=0.1\%$. 90% yield is also good enough when
we discard badly fabricated quantum computation chips, while 80% yield does not
show enough error suppression even when discarding 90% of the chips. We
evaluated several metrics for predicting chip performance, and found that the
average of the product of the number of data qubits and the cycle time of a
stabilizer measurement of stabilizers gave the strongest correlation with
post-correction residual error rates. Our analysis will help with selecting
usable quantum computation chips from among the pool of all fabricated chips.

could operate in particular cases is unclear. We perform 2D and 3D numerical
simulations of pairs of giant planets in a protoplanetary disc as they form and
maintain a mean motion commensurability. We consider systems with current
parameters similar to those of HD 155358, 24 Sextantis and HD 60532, and disc
models of varying mass, decreasing mass corresponding to increasing age. For
the lowest mass discs, systems with planets in the Jovian mass range migrate
inwards maintaining a 2:1 commensurability. Systems with the inner planet
currently at around 1 au from the central star could have originated at a few
au and migrated inwards on a time scale comparable to protoplanetary disc
lifetimes. Systems of larger mass planets such as HD 60532 attain 3:1 resonance
as observed. For a given mass accretion rate, results are insensitive to the
disc model for the range of viscosity prescriptions adopted, there being good
agreement between 2D and 3D simulations. However, in a higher mass disc a pair
of Jovian mass planets passes through 2:1 resonance before attaining a
temporary phase lasting a few thousand orbits in an unstable 5:3 resonance
prior to undergoing a scattering. Thus finding systems in this commensurability
is unlikely.

academic and industrial interest. In this paper, we offer a systematic review
of this field, summarizing the contributions of individual efforts and
exploring their relations. We discuss the new properties and challenges in POI
recommendation, compared with traditional recommendation problems, e.g., movie
recommendation. Then, we present a comprehensive review in three aspects:
influential factors for POI recommendation, methodologies employed for POI
recommendation, and different tasks in POI recommendation. Specifically, we
propose three taxonomies to classify POI recommendation systems. First, we
categorize the systems by the influential factors check-in characteristics,
including the geographical information, social relationship, temporal
influence, and content indications. Second, we categorize the systems by the
methodology, including systems modeled by fused methods and joint methods.
Third, we categorize the systems as general POI recommendation and successive
POI recommendation by subtle differences in the recommendation task whether to
be bias to the recent check-in. For each category, we summarize the
contributions and system features, and highlight the representative work.
Moreover, we discuss the available data sets and the popular metrics. Finally,
we point out the possible future directions in this area and conclude this
survey.

  grids",,,"10.1145/3165280",,"cs.NA cs.MS","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We present a family of spacetree-based multigrid realizations using the
tree's multiscale nature to derive coarse grids. They align with matrix-free
geometric multigrid solvers as they never assemble the system matrices which is
cumbersome for dynamically adaptive grids and full multigrid. The most
sophisticated realizations use BoxMG to construct operator-dependent
prolongation and restriction in combination with Galerkin/Petrov-Galerkin
coarse-grid operators. This yields robust solvers for nontrivial elliptic
problems. We embed the algebraic, problem- and grid-dependent multigrid
operators as stencils into the grid and evaluate all matrix-vector products
in-situ throughout the grid traversals. While such an approach is not literally
matrix-free---the grid carries the matrix---we propose to switch to a
hierarchical representation of all operators. Only differences of algebraic
operators to their geometric counterparts are held. These hierarchical
differences can be stored and exchanged with small memory footprint. Our
realizations support arbitrary dynamically adaptive grids while they vertically
integrate the multilevel operations through spacetree linearization. This
yields good memory access characteristics, while standard colouring of mesh
entities with domain decomposition allows us to use parallel manycore clusters.
All realization ingredients are detailed such that they can be used by other
codes.

Chern-Simons term in general, and its baryonic contribution in particular, for
the evolution of the matter asymmetries and the hypermagnetic field in the
temperature range $100$GeV$\leq T \leq 10$TeV. We show that an initial helical
hypermagnetic field, denoted by $B_Y^{(0)}$, can grow matter asymmetries from
zero initial value. However, the growth which is initially quadratic with
respect to $B_Y^{(0)}$, saturates for values larger than a critical value. The
inclusion of the baryonic contribution reduces this critical value, leading to
smaller final matter asymmetries. Meanwhile, $B_Y(T_{EW})$ becomes slightly
larger than $B_Y^{(0)}$. In the absence of the U$_\textrm{Y}$(1) Chern-Simons
term, the final values of matter asymmetries grow without saturation.
Conversely, we show that an initial matter asymmetry can grow an initial seed
of hypermagnetic field, provided the Chern-Simons term is taken into account.
The growth process saturates when the matter asymmetry drops abruptly. When the
baryonic contribution is included, the saturation occurs at an earlier time,
and $B_Y (T_{EW})$ becomes larger. We also show the results can be within the
acceptable range of present day data, provided the inverse cascade process is
also taken into account.

model. Three stochastic driving factors have been considered: (i) Driver's
acceleration is bounded. (ii) Driver's deceleration includes stochastic
component, which is depicted by a deceleration with the randomization
probability that is assumed to increase with the speed. (iii) Vehicles in the
jam state have a larger randomization probability. Two simulation scenarios are
conducted to test the model. In the first scenario, traffic flow on a circular
road is investigated. In the second scenario, empirical traffic flow patterns
in the NGSIM data induced by a rubberneck bottleneck is studied, and the
simulated traffic oscillations and synchronized traffic flow are consistent
with the empirical patterns. Moreover, two experiments of model calibration and
validation are conducted. The first is to calibrate and validate using
experimental data, which illustrates that the concave growth pattern has been
quantitatively simulated. The second is to calibrate and cross validate
vehicles' trajectories using NGSIM data, which exhibits that the car following
behaviors of single vehicles can be well described. Therefore, our study
highlights the importance of speed dependent stochasticity in traffic flow
modeling, which cannot be ignored as in most car-following studies.

been incorporated. The explanatory variables chosen are the 3 month Rupee
Dollar futures exchange rate (FX4), NIFTY returns (NIFTYR), Dow Jones
Industrial Average returns (DJIAR), Hang Seng returns (HSR), DAX returns (DR),
crude oil price (COP), CBOE VIX (CV) and India VIX (IV). To forecast the
exchange rate, we have used two different classes of frameworks namely,
Artificial Neural Network (ANN) based models and Time Series Econometric
models. Multilayer Feed Forward Neural Network (MLFFNN) and Nonlinear
Autoregressive models with Exogenous Input (NARX) Neural Network are the
approaches that we have used as ANN models. Generalized Autoregressive
Conditional Heteroskedastic (GARCH) and Exponential Generalized Autoregressive
Conditional Heteroskedastic (EGARCH) techniques are the ones that we have used
as Time Series Econometric methods. Within our framework, our results indicate
that, although the two different approaches are quite efficient in forecasting
the exchange rate, MLFNN and NARX are the most efficient.

for embedding watermarks, i.e. hidden digital data, in a video sequence to

any difference in the video, but a watermark extraction application can read
