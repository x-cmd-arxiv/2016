is to minimize a sum of objective functions over a multi-agent network. We
focus on the case when the inter-agent communication is described by a
strongly-connected, \emph{directed} graph. The proposed algorithm, ADD-OPT
(Accelerated Distributed Directed Optimization), achieves the best known
convergence rate for this class of problems,~$O(\mu^{k}),0<\mu<1$, given
strongly-convex, objective functions with globally Lipschitz-continuous
gradients, where~$k$ is the number of iterations. Moreover, ADD-OPT supports a
wider and more realistic range of step-sizes in contrast to existing work. In
particular, we show that ADD-OPT converges for arbitrarily small (positive)
step-sizes. Simulations further illustrate our results.

servers, and multiple processor systems. The image processing system is a
processing application system that allows Lumen to recognize and determine an
object from the image taken from the camera eye. The image processing system is
provided with four modules. They are face detection module to detect a person's
face, face recognition module to recognize a person's face, face tracking
module to follow a person's face, and human detection module to detect humans
based on the upper parts of person's body. Face detection module and human
detection module are implemented by using the library harcascade.xml on EMGU
CV. Face recognition module is implemented by adding the database for the face
that has been detected and store it in that database. Face tracking module is
implemented by using the Smooth Gaussian filter to the image.

driven Brownian particle moving in a periodic potential decreases with
increasing temperature within a finite temperature window. We identify as the
cause for this non-intuitive behaviour a dominant deterministic mechanism
consisting of a few unstable periodic orbits embedded into a chaotic attractor

be a bridge between all Lumen intelligence modules with NAO robot, and to be
the communication bridge between those Lumen intelligence modules. For the
second function, Lumen Server implements the AMQP protocol using RabbitMQ.
Besides that, writer also developed a control system for robot movement called
Lumen Motion. Lumen motion is implemented by modelling the movement of NAO

Writer also developed a program that connects all Lumen intelligence modules so
that Lumen can act like a tour guide. The implementation of this program uses
FSM and event-driven program. From implementation result, all the features
which were designed are successfully implemented. By the developing of this

fundamental understanding of bounds on asymmetric radiation from arbitrary

formalism, we show that infinite asymmetry is still achievable even without the
need of back-reflection mirrors, and we provide numerical examples of designs
that achieve asymmetry ratios exceeding $10^4$. The emission direction can also
be rapidly switched from top to bottom by tuning the wavevector or frequency.
Furthermore, we show that with the addition of weak material absorption loss,
such structures can be used to achieve perfect absorption with single-sided
illumination, even for single-pass absorption rates less than $0.5\%$ and
without back-reflection mirrors. Our work provides new design principles for

crucially depends on the structure of the relaxation time. Along the chemical

bulk viscosity as well as the bulk viscosity to entropy density ratio
decreases, which also agrees with earlier references. Our results indicate the

data with no additional manual annotations is a novel but challenging area in
the multimedia and the machine learning community. A considerable amount of
videos on the web are associated with rich but noisy contextual information,
such as the title, which provides weak annotations or labels about the video
content. To leverage the big noisy web labels, this paper proposes a novel
method called WEbly-Labeled Learning (WELL), which is established on the
state-of-the-art machine learning algorithm inspired by the learning process of
human. WELL introduces a number of novel multi-modal approaches to incorporate
meaningful prior knowledge called curriculum from the noisy web videos. To
investigate this problem, we empirically study the curriculum constructed from
the multi-modal features of the videos collected from YouTube and Flickr. The
efficacy and the scalability of WELL have been extensively demonstrated on two
public benchmarks, including the largest multimedia dataset and the largest
manually-labeled video set. The comprehensive experimental results demonstrate
that WELL outperforms state-of-the-art studies by a statically significant
margin on learning concepts from noisy web video data. In addition, the results
also verify that WELL is robust to the level of noisiness in the video data.
Notably, WELL trained on sufficient noisy web labels is able to achieve a
comparable accuracy to supervised learning methods trained on the clean
manually-labeled data.

Curiously, including this data and recomputing the fit yields a quite similar

features. At day +205 and later epochs, forbidden lines dominate much of the
optical spectrum formation; however, our results indicate that recombination,
not collisional excitation, is the most influential physical process driving
spectrum formation at these late times. Consequently, our synthetic optical and
UV spectra at all epochs presented here are formed almost exclusively through
recombination-driven fluorescence. Furthermore, our models suggest that the
ultraviolet spectrum even as late as day +360 is optically thick and consists
of permitted lines from several iron-peak species. These results indicate that

of constraints on overlapping sets of variables, and the goal is to assign
values from a fixed domain to the variables so that all constraints are
satisfied. In the optimization version, the goal is to maximize the number of
satisfied constraints. An approximation algorithm for CSP is called robust if
it outputs an assignment satisfying a $(1-g(\varepsilon))$-fraction of
constraints on any $(1-\varepsilon)$-satisfiable instance, where the loss
function $g$ is such that $g(\varepsilon)\rightarrow 0$ as
$\varepsilon\rightarrow 0$.
  We study how the robust approximability of CSPs depends on the set of
constraint relations allowed in instances, the so-called constraint language.
All constraint languages admitting a robust polynomial-time algorithm (with
some $g$) have been characterised by Barto and Kozik, with the general bound on
the loss $g$ being doubly exponential, specifically
$g(\varepsilon)=O((\log\log(1/\varepsilon))/\log(1/\varepsilon))$. It is
natural to ask when a better loss can be achieved: in particular, polynomial
loss $g(\varepsilon)=O(\varepsilon^{1/k})$ for some constant $k$. In this
paper, we consider CSPs with a constraint language having a near-unanimity
polymorphism. We give two randomized robust algorithms with polynomial loss for
such CSPs: one works for any near-unanimity polymorphism and the parameter $k$
in the loss depends on the size of the domain and the arity of the relations in
$\Gamma$, while the other works for a special ternary near-unanimity operation
called dual discriminator with $k=2$ for any domain size. In the latter case,
the CSP is a common generalisation of Unique Games with a fixed domain and
2-SAT. In the former case, we use the algebraic approach to the CSP. Both cases
use the standard semidefinite programming relaxation for CSP.

efficient and secure post-quantum cryptography. The two main hard problems
underlying its security are the shortest vector problem (SVP) and the closest
vector problem (CVP). Various algorithms have been studied for solving these
problems, and for SVP, lattice sieving currently dominates in terms of the
asymptotic time complexity: one can heuristically solve SVP in time
$2^{0.292d}$ in high dimensions $d$ [BDGL'16]. Although several SVP algorithms
can also be used to solve CVP, it is not clear whether this also holds for
heuristic lattice sieving methods. The best time complexity for CVP is
currently $2^{0.377d}$ [BGJ'14].
  In this paper we revisit sieving algorithms for solving SVP, and study how
these algorithms can be modified to solve CVP and its variants as well. Our
first method is aimed at solving one problem instance and minimizes the overall
time complexity for a single CVP instance with a time complexity of
$2^{0.292d}$. Our second method minimizes the amortized time complexity for
several instances on the same lattice, at the cost of a larger preprocessing
cost. We can solve the closest vector problem with preprocessing (CVPP) with
$2^{0.636d}$ space and preprocessing, in $2^{0.136d}$ time, while the query
complexity can even be reduced to $2^{\epsilon d}$ at the cost of preprocessing
time and memory complexities of $(1/\epsilon)^{O(d)}$.
  For easier variants of CVP, such as approximate CVP and bounded distance
decoding (BDD), we further show how the preprocessing method achieves even
better complexities. For instance, we can solve approximate CVPP with large
approximation factors $k$ with polynomial-sized advice in polynomial time if $k
= \Omega(\sqrt{d/\log d})$, heuristically closing the gap between the
decision-CVPP result of [AR'04] and the search-CVPP result of [DRS'14].

small increase in volume which explains why the phase transition is more
difficult to observe upon cooling under pressure. Slow-cooling ice VI at 1.4
GPa gives essentially fully hydrogen-disordered ice VI. Consistent with earlier
studies, the ice XV obtained after slow-cooling at ambient pressure is best
described with P-1 space group symmetry. Using a new computational approach, we
achieve the atomistic reconstruction of a supercell structure that is
consistent with the average partially ordered structure derived from Rietveld
refinements. This shows that C-type networks are most prevalent in ice XV but
other structural motifs outside of the classifications of the fully

have few edges (few range measurements among sensors) and can be represented
using a tree, it is possible to devise an efficient distributed localization
algorithm that solely relies on second-order methods. Particularly, we apply a
state-of-the-art primal-dual interior-point method to a semidefinite relaxation
of the maximum-likelihood formulation of the localization problem. We then show
how it is possible to exploit the tree-structure in the network and use
message-passing or dynamic programming over trees, to distribute computations
among different computational agents. The resulting algorithm requires far
fewer iterations and communications among agents to converge to an accurate
estimate. Moreover, the number of required communications among agents, seems
to be less sensitive and more robust to the number of sensors in the network,
the number of available measurements and the quality of the measurements. This
is in stark contrast to distributed algorithms that rely on first-order
methods. We illustrate the performance of our algorithm using experiments based
on simulated and real data.

Fermi gas under harmonic confinement. Our analysis suggests the possibility of
experimentally studying, in this system, an anisotropic shear viscosity tensor
driven by the anisotropy in the trapping potential. In particular, we suggest
that this experimental setup could mimic some features of anisotropic
geometries that have recently been studied for strongly coupled field theories
which have a gravitational dual. Results using the AdS/CFT correspondence in
these theories show that in systems with a background linear potential, certain
viscosity components can be made much smaller than the entropy density,
parametrically violating the bound proposed by Kovtun, Son and Starinets (KSS).
This intuition, along with results from a Boltzmann analysis that we perform,
suggests that a violation of the KSS bound can perhaps occur in the unitary
Fermi gas system when it is subjected to a suitable anisotropic trapping
potential which may be approximated to be linear in a suitable range of
parameters.
  We give a concrete proposal for an experimental setup where an anisotropic
shear viscosity tensor may arise. In such situations, it may also be possible
to observe a reduction in the spin one component of the shear viscosity from
its lowest value observed so far in ultracold Fermi gases. In extreme
anisotropic situations, the reduction may be enough to reduce the shear
viscosity to entropy ratio below the proposed KSS bound, although this regime
is difficult to analyze in a theoretically controlled manner.

  bottleneck in sampling-based motion planning",,,,,"cs.RO cs.CG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The complexity of nearest-neighbor search dominates the asymptotic running
time of many sampling-based motion-planning algorithms. However, collision
detection is often considered to be the computational bottleneck in practice.
Examining various asymptotically optimal planning algorithms, we characterize
settings, which we call NN-sensitive, in which the practical computational role
of nearest-neighbor search is far from being negligible, i.e., the portion of
running time taken up by nearest-neighbor search is comparable, or sometimes
even greater than the portion of time taken up by collision detection. This
reinforces and substantiates the claim that motion-planning algorithms could
significantly benefit from efficient and possibly specifically-tailored
nearest-neighbor data structures. The asymptotic (near) optimality of these
algorithms relies on a prescribed connection radius, defining a ball around a
configuration $q$, such that $q$ needs to be connected to all other
configurations in that ball. To facilitate our study, we show how to adapt this
radius to non-Euclidean spaces, which are prevalent in motion planning. This
technical result is of independent interest, as it enables to compare the
radial-connection approach with the common alternative, namely, connecting each
configuration to its $k$ nearest neighbors ($k$-NN). Indeed, as we demonstrate,
there are scenarios where using the radial connection scheme, a solution path
of a specific cost is produced ten-fold (and more) faster than with $k$-NN.

leads to optical spin Hall or orbital Hall effect, exhibited as spin-dependent
or topological charge-dependent transverse shift of optical beam. Conservation
of AM enables spin-to-orbital AM conversion, where circular-polarized Gaussian
beam is converted to opposite-helicity circular-polarized vortex beam with
topological charge $\pm 2$, an example of controlling spatial beam profiling by

unchanged, the same as that of incident Gaussian beam, meaning a null

creation may occur similarly to when they are coupled to external

modified Dirac or Klein-Gordon equations for elementary fermions and bosons

in a general 2D spacetime and show examples of spinor wave packet dynamics in
some background spacetimes. In particular, we cover the phenomenon of particle
creation in a time-dependent metric. Photonic analogs of these effects are then

provides a visualisation of the Dirac spinor propagating in curved 2D
spacetime. The extent to which such a single-particle description can be said
to mimic particle creation is discussed.

rewrites. Unfortunately, developing query optimizers remains a highly
challenging task. Part of the challenges comes from the intricacies and rich
features of query languages, which makes reasoning about rewrite rules
difficult. In this paper, we propose a machine-checkable denotational semantics
for SQL, the de facto language for relational database, for rigorously
validating rewrite rules. Unlike previously proposed semantics that are either
non-mechanized or only cover a small amount of SQL language features, our
semantics covers all major features of SQL, including bags, correlated
subqueries, aggregation, and indexes. Our mechanized semantics, called HoTTSQL,
is based on K-Relations and homotopy type theory, where we denote relations as
mathematical functions from tuples to univalent types. We have implemented
HoTTSQL in Coq, which takes only fewer than 300 lines of code and have proved a
wide range of SQL rewrite rules, including those from database research
literature (e.g., magic set rewrites) and real-world query optimizers (e.g.,
subquery elimination). Several of these rewrite rules have never been
previously proven correct. In addition, while query equivalence is generally
undecidable, we have implemented an automated decision procedure using HoTTSQL
for conjunctive queries: a well-studied decidable fragment of SQL that
encompasses many real-world queries.

all-southern-sky survey of 2-h per pointing with the Australian Square
Kilometre Array Pathfinder for intervening HI absorbers at intermediate
cosmological redshifts between $z = 0.4$ and $1$. For example, if such a survey
yielded $1000$ absorbers we would infer a harmonic-mean spin temperature of
$\overline{T}_\mathrm{spin} \sim 100$K for the population of damped Lyman
$\alpha$ (DLAs) absorbers at these redshifts, indicating that more than $50$
per cent of the neutral gas in these systems is in a cold neutral medium (CNM).
Conversely, a lower yield of only 100 detections would imply
$\overline{T}_\mathrm{spin} \sim 1000$K and a CNM fraction less than $10$ per
cent. We propose that this method can be used to provide independent
verification of the spin temperature evolution reported in recent 21cm surveys
of known DLAs at high redshift and for measuring the spin temperature at
intermediate redshifts below $z \approx 1.7$, where the Lyman-$\alpha$ line is
inaccessible using ground-based observatories. Increasingly more sensitive and
larger surveys with the Square Kilometre Array should provide stronger
statistical constraints on the average spin temperature. However, these will
ultimately be limited by the accuracy to which we can determine the HI column

studied within the five-dimensional Sakai-Sugimoto model. We introduce a new
approximation that models a smeared crystal of solitonic baryons by assuming
spatial homogeneity to obtain an effective kink theory in the holographic
direction. The kink theory correctly reproduces a first order phase transition
to lightly bound nuclear matter. As the density is further increased the kink
splits into a pair of half-kink constituents, providing a concrete realization
of the previously suggested dyonic salt phase, where the bulk soliton splits
into constituents at high density. The kink model also captures the phenomenon
of baryonic popcorn, in which a first order phase transition generates an
additional soliton layer in the holographic direction. We find that this
popcorn transition takes place at a density below the dyonic salt phase, making
the latter energetically unfavourable. However, the kink model predicts only
one pop, rather than the sequence of pops suggested by previous approximations.
In the kink model the two layers produced by the single pop form the surface of
a soliton bag that increases in size as the baryon chemical potential is
increased. The interior of the bag is filled with abelian electric potential
and the instanton charge density is localized on the surface of the bag. The
soliton bag may provide a holographic description of a quarkyonic phase.

extension of the Kauffman polynomial and the other one as an extension of the
Jones polynomial which is constructed via a bracket polynomial for tied links.
These invariants are more powerful than both the Kauffman and the bracket
polynomials when evaluated on classical links. Further, the extension of the
Kauffman polynomial is more powerful of the Homflypt polynomial, as well as of
certain new invariants introduced recently. Also we propose a new algebra which
plays in the case of tied links the same role as the BMW algebra for the
Kauffman polynomial in the classical case. Moreover, we prove that the Markov
trace on this new algebra can be recovered from the extension of the Kauffman
polynomial defined here.

obtained from the adjacency matrix of $G$ by switching some ones to zeros

quantity is closely related to the fundamental information-theoretic problems
of (linear) index coding (Bar-Yossef et al., FOCS'06), network coding and
distributed storage, and to Valiant's approach for proving superlinear circuit
lower bounds (Valiant, Boolean Function Complexity '92).
  We prove tight bounds on the minrank of random Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi graphs
$G(n,p)$ for all regimes of $p\in[0,1]$. In particular, for any constant $p$,
we show that $\mathsf{minrk}(G) = \Theta(n/\log n)$ with high probability,
where $G$ is chosen from $G(n,p)$. This bound gives a near quadratic
improvement over the previous best lower bound of $\Omega(\sqrt{n})$ (Haviv and
Langberg, ISIT'12), and partially settles an open problem raised by Lubetzky

obtained by the ""clique covering"" solution, and settles the linear index coding
problem for random graphs.
  Finally, our result suggests a new avenue of attack, via derandomization, on
Valiant's approach for proving superlinear lower bounds for logarithmic-depth

understand if the non-ionizing collisions can independently be a cause of
destabilization of an electron cloud, a second set of numerical experiments
were performed with pure electron plasmas making non-ionizing collisions with
different densities of background neutrals. These experiments reveal that the
nature of potential energy extraction from the electron cloud by the

emanates from the high densities produced in relation to other methods, however
beam density remains fundamentally limited by interference with shock waves
reflected from collimating surfaces. Here we show experimentally that this

interacting surface. An increase in beam density of nearly an order of
magnitude was measured at the lowest surface temperature, with no further
fundamental limitation reached. Visualization of the shock waves by plasma

indicate that the suppression of the shock structure is partially caused by
lowering the momentum flux of reflected particles, and significantly enhanced

subsequent free evolution of the lepton chiral asymmetry and helical magnetic
fields in the early hot universe. This process is known to be affected by the
Abelian anomaly of the electroweak gauge interactions. As a consequence, chiral
asymmetry in the fermion distribution generates magnetic fields of non-zero
helicity, and vice versa. We take into account the presence of thermal bath,
which serves as a seed for the development of instability in magnetic field in
the presence of externally generated lepton chiral asymmetry. The developed
helical magnetic field and lepton chiral asymmetry support each other,
considerably prolonging their mutual existence, in the process of `inverse
cascade' transferring magnetic-field power from small to large spatial scales.
For cosmologically interesting initial conditions, the chiral asymmetry and the
energy density of helical magnetic field are shown to evolve by scaling laws,
effectively depending on a single combined variable. In this case, the
late-time asymptotics of the conformal chiral chemical potential reproduces the
universal scaling law previously found in the literature for the system under
consideration. This regime is terminated at lower temperatures because of
scattering of electrons with chirality change, which exponentially washes out
chiral asymmetry. We derive an expression for the termination temperature as a
function of the chiral asymmetry and energy density of helical magnetic field.

""defective"" items from a large population, by grouping items into as few test
pools as possible. The test outcome of a pool is positive if it contains at
least one defective item, and is negative otherwise. GT algorithms are utilized
in numerous applications, and in many of them maintaining the privacy of the
tested items, namely, keeping secret whether they are defective or not, is
critical.
  In this paper, we consider a scenario where there is an eavesdropper (Eve)
who is able to observe a subset of the GT outcomes (pools). We propose a new
non-adaptive Secure Group Testing (SGT) scheme based on information-theoretic
principles. The new proposed test design keeps the eavesdropper ignorant
regarding the items' status. Specifically, when the fraction of tests observed
by Eve is $0 \leq \delta <1$, we prove that with the naive Maximum Likelihood
(ML) decoding algorithm the number of tests required for both correct
reconstruction at the legitimate user (with high probability) and negligible
information leakage to Eve is $\frac{1}{1-\delta}$ times the number of tests
required with no secrecy constraint for the fixed $K$ regime. By a matching
converse, we completely characterize the Secure GT capacity. Moreover, we
consider the Definitely Non-Defective (DND) computationally efficient decoding
algorithm, proposed in the literature for non-secure GT. We prove that with the
new secure test design, for $\delta < 1/2$, the number of tests required,
without any constraint on $K$, is at most $\frac{1}{1/2-\delta}$ times the
number of tests required with no secrecy constraint.

the quantum fluctuations of the gravitational metric. If the metric can be
decomposed as the sum of the classical and of a fluctuating part, of quantum
origin, then the corresponding Einstein quantum gravity generates at the
classical level modified gravity models with a nonminimal coupling between
geometry and matter. As a first step in our study, after assuming that the
expectation value of the quantum correction can be generally expressed in terms
of an arbitrary second order tensor constructed from the metric and from the
thermodynamic quantities characterizing the matter content of the Universe, we
derive the (classical) gravitational field equations in their general form. We
analyze in detail the cosmological models obtained by assuming that the quantum
correction tensor is given by the coupling of a scalar field and of a scalar
function to the metric tensor, and by a term proportional to the matter
energy-momentum tensor. For each considered model we obtain the gravitational
field equations, and the generalized Friedmann equations for the case of a flat
homogeneous and isotropic geometry. In some of these models the divergence of
the matter energy-momentum tensor is non-zero, indicating a process of matter
creation, which corresponds to an irreversible energy flow from the
gravitational field to the matter fluid, and which is direct consequence of the
nonminimal curvature-matter coupling. The cosmological evolution equations of
these modified gravity models induced by the quantum fluctuations of the metric
are investigated in detail by using both analytical and numerical methods, and
it is shown that a large variety of cosmological models can be constructed,
which, depending on the numerical values of the model parameters, can exhibit
both accelerating and decelerating behaviors.

research hierarchies of cities in a geographical region. However, the
allometric patterns are easily influenced by random disturbance from the noises

are related to the hierarchical scaling laws associated with fractal structure.
In this paper, the scaling laws of hierarchies with cascade structure are used
to study Chinese cities, and the method of R/S analysis is applied to analyzing
the change trend of the allometric scaling exponents. The results show that the
hierarchical scaling relations of Chinese cities became clearer and clearer

fluctuated around 0.85, and the local scaling exponent approached to 0.85. The
Hurst exponent of the allometric parameter change is greater than 0.5,
indicating persistence and a long-term memory of urban evolution. The main
conclusions can be reached as follows: the allometric scaling law of cities
represents an evolutionary order rather than an invariable rule, which emerges
from self-organized process of urbanization, and the ideas from allometry and
fractals can be combined to optimize spatial and hierarchical structure of
urban systems in future city planning.

entropy functions. However, spatial entropy always depends on the scale of
measurement, and it is difficult to find a characteristic value for it. In
contrast, fractal parameters can be employed to characterize scale-free
phenomena. This paper is devoted to exploring the similarities and differences
between spatial entropy and fractal dimension in urban description. Drawing an
analogy between cities and growing fractals, we illustrate the definitions of
fractal dimension based on different entropy concepts. Three representative
fractal dimensions in the multifractal dimension set are utilized to make
empirical analyses of urban form of two cities. The results show that the
entropy values are not determinate, but the fractal dimension value is certain;
if the linear size of boxes is small enough (e.g., <1/25), the linear
correlation between entropy and fractal dimension is clear. Further empirical
analysis indicates that fractal dimension is close to the characteristic values
of spatial entropy. This suggests that the physical meaning of fractal
dimension can be interpreted by the ideas from entropy and scales and the
conclusion is revealing for future spatial analysis of cities. Key words:

perturbative super-renormalizable Quantum Field Theory (QFT), and while they
predict a different power spectrum from the standard power-law used in
$\Lambda$CDM, they still provide an excellent fit to data (within their regime
of validity). By comparing the Bayesian evidence for the models, we find that
$\Lambda$CDM does a better job globally, while the holographic models provide a
(marginally) better fit to data without very low multipoles (i.e. $l\lesssim
30$), where the dual QFT becomes non-perturbative. Observations can be used to
exclude some QFT models, while we also find models satisfying all
phenomenological constraints: the data rules out the dual theory being
Yang-Mills theory coupled to fermions only, but allows for Yang-Mills theory
coupled to non-minimal scalars with quartic interactions. Lattice simulations
of 3d QFT's can provide non-perturbative predictions for large-angle statistics
of the cosmic microwave background, and potentially explain its apparent
anomalies.

control, assumed to be detected by a random set of agents in the swarm. The
agents that detect the control signal become ad-hoc leaders of the swarm. The
agents are assumed to be velocity controlled, identical, anonymous, memory-less
units with limited capabilities of sensing their neighborhood. Each agent is
programmed to behave according to a linear local gathering process, based on
the relative position of all its neighbors. The detected exogenous control,
which is a desired velocity vector, is added by the leaders to the local
gathering control. The graph induced by the agents adjacency is referred to as
the visibility graph. We show that for piece-wise constant system parameters
and a connected visibility graph, the swarm asymptotically aligns in each
time-interval on a line in the direction of the exogenous control signal, and
all the agents move with identical speed. These results hold for two models of
pairwise influence in the gathering process, uniform and scaled. The impact of
the influence model is mostly evident when the visibility graph is incomplete.
These results are conditioned by the preservation of the connectedness of the
visibility graph. In the second part of the report we analyze sufficient
conditions for preserving the connectedness of the visibility graph. We show
that if the visibility graph is complete then certain bounds on the control
signal suffice to preserve the completeness of the graph. However, when the
graph is incomplete, general conditions, independent of the leaders topology,
could not be found.

voltage difference applied across the reaction zone. Since combustion
diagnostics and flame control strategies based on electric fields depend on the
amount of current drawn from flames, there is significant interest in modeling
and understanding i-V curves. We implement and apply a detailed model for the
simulation of the production and transport of ions and electrons in one
dimensional premixed flames. An analytical reduced model is developed based on
the detailed one, and analytical expressions are used to gain insight into the
characteristics of the i-V curve for various flame configurations. In order for
the reduced model to capture the spatial distribution of the electric field
accurately, the concept of a dead zone region, where voltage is constant, is
introduced, and a suitable closure for the spatial extent of the dead zone is
proposed and validated. The results from the reduced modeling framework are
found to be in good agreement with those from the detailed simulations. The
saturation voltage is found to depend significantly on the flame location
relative to the electrodes, and on the sign of the voltage difference applied.
Furthermore, at sub-saturation conditions, the current is shown to increase
linearly or quadratically with the applied voltage, depending on the flame
location. These limiting behaviors exhibited by the reduced model elucidate the
features of i-V curves observed experimentally. The reduced model relies on the
existence of a thin layer where charges are produced, corresponding to the
reaction zone of a flame. Consequently, the analytical model we propose is not
limited to the study of premixed flames, and may be applied easily to others
configurations, e.g. nonpremixed counterflow flames.

is increased. For ferrite film with two spin layers, magnetic easy and hard
directions can be observed at 0.75 and 1.2 radians, respectively, when the
