modeled with a weighted graph that encodes the pairwise similarity among

We used different approaches to find the prototypical elements of the clusters

collecting players with a definite strategy and the other one collecting
players that try to learn from others the correct strategy to play. The latter
set of players can be considered as new data points that have to be clustered

4560 {\AA} to 9480 {\AA}, published to date. A change in linear polarisation
across the H{\alpha} line, is detected in all objects. Such a line effect
reveals the fact that stellar photons are scattered off free electrons that are
not distributed in a spherically symmetric volume, suggesting the presence of
small disks around these accreting objects. Thanks to the large wavelength
coverage, we can report that H{\alpha} is the spectral line in the optical
wavelength range that is most sensitive to revealing deviations from spherical
symmetry, and the one most likely to show a line effect across the polarisation
in such cases. Few other spectral lines display changes in polarisation across
the line. In addition, H{\alpha} is the only line which shows an effect across
its absorption component in some sources. We present a scenario explaining this
finding and demonstrate that the detection of the line effect strongly relies
on the number of photons scattered into our line of sight. We highlight the
special case of R Mon, which is the only object in our sample to show many
lines with a polarisation effect, which is much stronger than in all other
objects. Given that the object and its nebulosity is spatially resolved, we
argue that this is due to scattering of the stellar and emission spectrum off
circumstellar dust.

be mutually exclusive across tumors, providing a signal for distinguishing
driver mutations from a larger number of random passenger mutations. This
mutual exclusivity signal can be confounded by high and highly variable
mutation rates across a cohort of samples. Current statistical tests for
exclusivity that incorporate both per-gene and per-sample mutational
frequencies are computationally expensive and have limited precision.
  We formulate a weighted exact test for assessing the significance of
mutational exclusivity in an arbitrary number of mutational events. Our test
conditions on the number of samples with a mutation as well as per-event,
per-sample mutation probabilities. We provide a recursive formula to compute
$p$-values for the weighted test exactly as well as a highly accurate and
efficient saddlepoint approximation of the test. We use our test to approximate
a commonly used permutation test for exclusivity that conditions on per-event,
per-sample mutation frequencies. However, our test is more efficient and it
recovers more significant results than the permutation test. We use our
Weighted Exclusivity Test (WExT) software to analyze hundreds of colorectal and
endometrial samples from The Cancer Genome Atlas, which are two cancer types
that often have extremely high mutation rates. On both cancer types, the
weighted test identifies sets of mutually exclusive mutations in cancer genes
with fewer false positives than earlier approaches.

important issues encountered when modeling bipartite networks is devising a way
to obtain a (monopartite) projection on the layer of interest, which preserves
as much as possible the information encoded into the original bipartite

statistically-validated projections of bipartite networks, according to which
any two nodes sharing a statistically-significant number of neighbors are
linked. Since assessing the statistical significance of nodes similarity
requires a proper statistical benchmark, here we consider a set of four null
models, defined within the exponential random graph framework. Our algorithm
outputs a matrix of link-specific p-values, from which a validated projection
is straightforwardly obtainable, upon running a multiple hypothesis testing
procedure. Finally, we test our method on an economic network (i.e. the
countries-products World Trade Web representation) and a social network (i.e.
MovieLens, collecting the users' ratings of a list of movies). In both cases
non-trivial communities are detected: while projecting the World Trade Web on
the countries layer reveals modules of similarly-industrialized nations,
projecting it on the products layer allows communities characterized by an
increasing level of complexity to be detected; in the second case, projecting
MovieLens on the films layer allows clusters of movies whose affinity cannot be
fully accounted for by genre similarity to be individuated.

systems of partial differential equations (PDEs) where unknowns associated with
different physical quantities are not necessarily co-located at mesh points.
Specifically, we investigate a $Q_2-Q_1$ mixed finite element discretization of
the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations where the number of velocity nodes
is much greater than the number of pressure nodes. Consequently, some velocity
degrees-of-freedom (dofs) are defined at spatial locations where there are no
corresponding pressure dofs. Thus, AMG approaches leveraging this co-located
structure are not applicable. This paper instead proposes an automatic AMG
coarsening that mimics certain pressure/velocity dof relationships of the
$Q_2-Q_1$ discretization. The main idea is to first automatically define coarse
pressures in a somewhat standard AMG fashion and then to carefully (but
automatically) choose coarse velocity unknowns so that the spatial location
relationship between pressure and velocity dofs resembles that on the finest
grid. To define coefficients within the inter-grid transfers, an energy
minimization AMG (EMIN-AMG) is utilized. EMIN-AMG is not tied to specific
coarsening schemes and grid transfer sparsity patterns, and so it is applicable
to the proposed coarsening. Numerical results highlighting solver performance
are given on Stokes and incompressible Navier-Stokes problems.

computers means that it will become necessary to take into account the effects
of randomly occurring faults on numerical methods. Further, in the event of a
hard fault occurring, a decision has to be made as to what remedial action
should be taken in order to resume the execution of the algorithm. The action
that is chosen can have a dramatic effect on the performance and
characteristics of the scheme. Ideally, the resulting algorithm should be
subjected to the same kind of mathematical analysis that was applied to the
original, deterministic variant.
  The purpose of this work is to provide an analysis of the behaviour of the
multigrid algorithm in the presence of faults. Multigrid is arguably the method
of choice for the solution of large-scale linear algebra problems arising from
discretization of partial differential equations and it is of considerable
importance to anticipate its behaviour on an exascale machine. The analysis of
resilience of algorithms is in its infancy and the current work is perhaps the
first to provide a mathematical model for faults and analyse the behaviour of a

history determines whether a galaxy quenches star formation at high redshift.
We first simulate, in a full cosmological context, a galaxy of total dynamical
mass $10^{12}\,M_{\odot}$ at $z=2$. Then we systematically alter the accretion
history of the galaxy by minimally changing the linear overdensity in the
initial conditions. This ""genetic modification"" approach allows the generation
of three sets of $\Lambda$CDM initial conditions leading to maximum merger
ratios of 1:10, 1:5 and 2:3 respectively. The changes leave the final halo
mass, large scale structure and local environment unchanged, providing a
controlled numerical experiment. Interaction between the AGN physics and
mergers in the three cases lead respectively to a star-forming,
temporarily-quenched and permanently-quenched galaxy. However the differences
do not primarily lie in the black hole accretion rates, but in the kinetic
effects of the merger: the galaxy is resilient against AGN feedback unless its
gaseous disk is first disrupted. Typical accretion rates are comparable in the
three cases, falling below $0.1\,M_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$, equivalent to around
$2\%$ of the Eddington rate or $10^{-3}$ times the pre-quenching star formation
rate, in agreement with observations. This low level of black hole accretion
can be sustained even when there is insufficient dense cold gas for star
formation. Conversely, supernova feedback is too distributed to generate
outflows in high-mass systems, and cannot maintain quenching over periods
longer than the halo gas cooling time.

$(3+1)$-dimensional Schwarzschild black hole of horizon radius $r_{\text{H}}$
with the familiar Stefan-Boltzmann radiation power of a $(3+1)$-dimensional
flat space perfect blackbody emitter, Giddings concluded that the source of the

Schwarzschild black-hole horizon whose effective radius $r_{\text{A}}$ is
characterized by the relation $\Delta r\equiv r_{\text{A}}-r_{\text{H}}\sim

dimensionless radii $r_{\text{A}}/r_{\text{H}}$ which characterize the
black-hole quantum atmospheres, as determined from the Hawking black-hole
radiation power and the $(D+1)$-dimensional Stefan-Boltzmann radiation law, are
a decreasing function of the number $D+1$ of spacetime dimensions. In
particular, it is shown that radiating $(D+1)$-dimensional Schwarzschild black
holes are characterized by the relation
$(r_{\text{A}}-r_{\text{H}})/r_{\text{H}}\ll1$ in the large $D\gg1$ regime. Our

study of dynamical positive and negative contributions to pairing reveals that
even though $V$ has a high-frequency depairing contribution, it also has a low
frequency pairing contribution since it can reinforce superexchange through
$J=4t^2/(U-V)$. Retardation is thus crucial to understand pairing in doped Mott
insulators, as suggested by previous zero-temperature studies. We also comment
on the tendency to charge order for large $V$ and on the persistence of d-wave
superconductivity over extended-$s$ or s+d-wave.

series, a symmetric function involving an arbitrary underlying formal power
series $f$ in the contents of the cells in a partition. In previous work we
have shown that the content series satisfies the KP equations. The main result
of this paper is a new partial differential equation for which the content
series is the unique solution, subject to a simple initial condition. This
equation is expressed in terms of families of operators that we call
$\mathcal{U}$ and $\mathcal{D}$ operators, whose action on the Schur symmetric
function $s_{\lambda}$ can be simply expressed in terms of powers of the
contents of the cells in $\lambda$. Among our results, we construct the
${\mathcal{U}}$ and ${\mathcal{D}}$ operators explicitly as partial
differential operators in the underlying power sum symmetric functions. We also
give a combinatorial interpretation for the content series in terms of the
Jucys-Murphy elements in the group algebra of the symmetric group. This leads
to an interpretation for the content series as a generating series for branched
covers of the sphere by a Riemann surface of arbitrary genus $g$. As particular
cases, by suitable choice of the underlying series $f$, the content series
specializes to the generating series for three known classes of branched
covers: Hurwitz numbers, monotone Hurwitz numbers, and $m$-hypermap numbers. We
apply our pde to give new proofs of the explicit formulas for these three
classes of number in genus $0$. In the case of the $m$-hypermap numbers of
Bousquet-M\'elou and Schaeffer, this is the first algebraic proof of this

has been modified very slightly in a way that is intended to cause a machine

be so subtle that a human observer does not even notice the modification at

security concerns because they could be used to perform an attack on machine
learning systems, even if the adversary has no access to the underlying model.
Up to now, all previous work have assumed a threat model in which the adversary
can feed data directly into the machine learning classifier. This is not always
the case for systems operating in the physical world, for example those which
are using signals from cameras and other sensors as an input. This paper shows
that even in such physical world scenarios, machine learning systems are

this way, our method is able to `see' the image in terms of both long-range

labeling. Besides, we integrate the proposed contextual RNNs into hierarchical
convolutional neural networks (CNNs), and exploit dependence relationships in
multiple levels to provide rich spatial and semantic information. Moreover, we
novelly adopt an attention model to effectively merge multiple levels and show
that it outperforms average- or max-pooling fusion strategies. Extensive

methods only use the label information of observed samples in the label
propagation stage, while ignoring such valuable information when learning the
graph. In this paper, we argue that it is beneficial to consider the label
information in the graph learning stage. Specifically, by enforcing the weight
of edges between labeled samples of different classes to be zero, we explicitly
incorporate the label information into the state-of-the-art graph learning
methods, such as the Low-Rank Representation (LRR), and propose a novel
semi-supervised graph learning method called Semi-Supervised Low-Rank
Representation (SSLRR). This results in a convex optimization problem with
linear constraints, which can be solved by the linearized alternating direction
method. Though we take LRR as an example, our proposed method is in fact very
general and can be applied to any self-representation graph learning methods.
Experiment results on both synthetic and real datasets demonstrate that the
proposed graph learning method can better capture the global geometric
structure of the data, and therefore is more effective for semi-supervised
learning tasks.

Galaxy mass models based on simple and analytical functions for the
density and potential pairs have been widely proposed in the literature. Disk
models constrained by kinematic data alone give information on the global disk
structure only very near the Galactic plane. We attempt to circumvent this
issue by constructing disk mass models whose three-dimensional structures are
constrained by a recent Galactic star counts model in the near-infrared and
also by observations of the hydrogen distribution in the disk. Our main aim is
to provide models for the gravitational potential of the Galaxy that are fully
analytical but also with a more realistic description of the density
distribution in the disk component. Methods. From the disk model directly based
on the observations (here divided into the thin and thick stellar disks and the
HI and H$_2$ disks subcomponents), we produce fitted mass models by combining
three Miyamoto-Nagai disk profiles of any ""model order"" (1, 2, or 3) for each
disk subcomponent. The Miyamoto-Nagai disks are combined with models for the
bulge and ""dark halo"" components and the total set of parameters is adjusted by
observational kinematic constraints. A model which includes a ring density
structure in the disk, beyond the solar Galactic radius, is also investigated.
Results. The Galactic mass models return very good matches to the imposed
observational constraints. In particular, the model with the ring density
structure provides a greater contribution of the disk to the rotational support
inside the solar circle. The gravitational potential models and their
associated force-fields are described in analytically closed forms, and in
addition, they are also compatible with our best knowledge of the stellar and
gas distributions in the disk component. The gravitational potential models are
suited for investigations of orbits in the Galactic disk.

approaches to perform this segmentation task. The proposed methods make use of
the fact that the background in each block is usually smoothly varying and can
be modeled well by a linear combination of a few smoothly varying basis
functions, while the foreground text and graphics create sharp discontinuity.
The algorithms separate the background and foreground pixels by trying to fit
background pixel values in the block into a smooth function using two different
schemes. One is based on robust regression, where the inlier pixels will be
considered as background, while remaining outlier pixels will be considered
foreground. The second approach uses a sparse decomposition framework where the
background and foreground layers are modeled with a smooth and sparse
components respectively. These algorithms have been tested on images extracted
from HEVC standard test sequences for screen content coding, and are shown to
have superior performance over previous approaches. The proposed methods can be
used in different applications such as text extraction, separate coding of

segmentation.

the more typically studied thick TI system in that the former has both a top
and a bottom surface where the states localized at both surfaces can couple to
each other due to the finite thickness. In typical spin torque experiments on
TI thin film systems, the top and bottom surfaces of the film are asymmetric as
the former is in contact with a ferromagnetic layer while the latter is
adjacent to a non magnetic substrate. This may lead to differing (i) potentials
and (ii) magnetization strengths experienced by the top and bottom surface
states. We show, via Kubo formula calculations, that each of these two effects
can lead to in-plane spin accumulation perpendicular to the magnetization
direction which are otherwise absent in a top-bottom symmetric TI thin film
system. This spin accumulation results from the breaking of the antisymmetry of
the spin accumulation around the zero magnetic field equal energy contours.

fine structure. Much of this comes in the form of linear features which are
most often assumed to be well aligned with the direction of the magnetic field
in the low plasma beta regime thought to dominate the upper chromosphere. We
use advanced radiative MHD simulations including the effects of ion-neutral
interactions (using the generalized Ohm's law) in the partially ionized
chromosphere to show that the magnetic field is often not well aligned with
chromospheric features. This occurs where the ambipolar diffusion is large,
i.e., ions and neutral populations decouple as the ion-neutral collision
frequency drops allowing the field to slip through the neutral population,
currents perpendicular to the field are strong, and thermodynamic timescales
are longer than or similar to the those of ambipolar diffusion. We find this
often happens in dynamic spicule or fibril-like features at the top of the
chromosphere. This has important consequences for field extrapolation methods
which increasingly use such upper chromospheric features to help constrain the
chromospheric magnetic field: our results invalidate the underlying assumption
that these features are aligned with the field. In addition, our results cast
doubt on results from 1D hydrodynamic models, which assume that plasma remains
on the same field lines. Finally, our simulations show that ambipolar diffusion
significantly alters the amount of free energy available in the coronal part of
our simulated volume, which is likely to have consequences for studies of flare
initiation.

unknown distribution in energy harvesting communication systems. In this
problem, the transmitter has to choose the transmit power based on the amount
of stored energy in its battery with the goal of maximizing the average rate
obtained over time. We model this problem as a Markov decision process (MDP)
with the transmitter as the agent, the battery status as the state, the
transmit power as the action and the rate obtained as the reward. The average
reward maximization problem over the MDP can be solved by a linear program (LP)
that uses the transition probabilities for the state-action pairs and their
reward values to choose a power allocation policy. Since the rewards associated
the state-action pairs are unknown, we propose two online learning algorithms:
UCLP and Epoch-UCLP that learn these rewards and adapt their policies along the
way. The UCLP algorithm solves the LP at each step to decide its current policy
using the upper confidence bounds on the rewards, while the Epoch-UCLP
algorithm divides the time into epochs, solves the LP only at the beginning of
the epochs and follows the obtained policy in that epoch. We prove that the
reward losses or regrets incurred by both these algorithms are upper bounded by
constants. Epoch-UCLP incurs a higher regret compared to UCLP, but reduces the
computational requirements substantially. We also show that the presented
algorithms work for online learning in cost minimization problems like the
packet scheduling with power-delay tradeoff with minor changes.

for coherent control. Here we demonstrate two modes of control around a conical
intersection. The first uses a continuous light field to control the population
on the two intersecting electronic states in the vicinity of a CI. The second
uses a pulsed light field to control wavepackets that are subjected to the
geometric phase shift in transit around a CI. This second technique is likely
to be useful for studying the role of nuclear dynamics in electronic coherence

among data in semi-supervised feature learning algorithms. In this paper, we
find that local discriminative information is also of importance for
semi-supervised feature learning. We propose a method that utilizes both the
manifold structure of data and local discriminant information. Specifically, we
define a local clique for each data point. The k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN) is
used to determine the structural information within each clique. We then employ
a variant of Fisher criterion model to each clique for local discriminant
evaluation and sum all cliques as global integration into the framework. In
this way, local discriminant information is embedded. Labels are also utilized
to minimize distances between data from the same class. In addition, we use the
kernel method to extend our proposed model and facilitate feature learning in a
high-dimensional space after feature mapping. Experimental results show that
our method is superior to all other compared methods over a number of datasets.

because such tasks require measurements performed for a long time. To measure a
spin period change, MU Cam is a good candidate because it has a spin
oscillation with a large amplitude enabling measurements with high precision.
Fortunately, in the past the spin period of MU Cam was measured with high
precision. To measure the spin period anew, in 2014-2015 we performed extensive
photometric observations of MU Cam, spanning a total duration of 208 h within
46 nights. We found that the spin, sideband and orbital periods are equal to
1187.16245+/-0.00047 s, 1276.3424+/-0.0022 s and 4.71942+/-0.00016 h,
respectively. Comparing the measured spin period with the spin period of MU Cam
in the past, we detected the spin period change with dP/dt=-(2.17+/-0.10) X
10^(-10). This rate of the spin period change was not stable and varied in a
time scale of years. During four nights in 2014 April-May MU Cam was fainter
than usual by 0.8 mag, and the amplitude of the sideband oscillation was five
times larger, denoting significant fraction of disc-overflow accretion. The
sideband oscillation showed a double-peaked pulse profile in the normal
brightness state. When the star brightness was decreased by 0.8 mag, the
sideband oscillation showed a single-peaked pulse profile. In contrast, the
spin pulse, which was quasi-sinusoidal, remained remarkably stable both in
profile and in amplitude. Moreover, the spin pulse was also remarkably stable
in a time scale of years and even decades. MU Cam is of great interest because
it represents a distinctive object with a large and unstable rate of the spin
period change and exhibits a distinctive behaviour of the pulse profiles.

  Minimization",,,,,"cs.NA","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Accompanied with the rising popularity of compressed sensing, the Alternating
Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM) has become the most widely used solver
for linearly constrained convex problems with separable objectives. In this
work, we observe that many previous variants of ADMM update the primal variable
by minimizing different majorant functions with their convergence proofs given
case by case. Inspired by the principle of majorization minimization, we
respectively present the unified frameworks and convergence analysis for the
Gauss-Seidel ADMMs and Jacobian ADMMs, which use different historical
information for the current updating. Our frameworks further generalize
previous ADMMs to the ones capable of solving the problems with non-separable
objectives by minimizing their separable majorant surrogates. We also show that
the bound which measures the convergence speed of ADMMs depends on the
tightness of the used majorant function. Then several techniques are introduced
to improve the efficiency of ADMMs by tightening the majorant functions. In
particular, we propose the Mixed Gauss-Seidel and Jacobian ADMM (M-ADMM) which
alleviates the slow convergence issue of Jacobian ADMMs by absorbing merits of
the Gauss-Seidel ADMMs. M-ADMM can be further improved by using backtracking,
wise variable partition and fully exploiting the structure of the constraint.
Beyond the guarantee in theory, numerical experiments on both synthesized and
real-world data further demonstrate the superiority of our new ADMMs in
practice. Finally, we release a toolbox at https://github.com/canyilu/LibADMM
that implements efficient ADMMs for many problems in compressed sensing.

an inertial frame, which in turns implies that the mass m of the falling body
is omitted. Otherwise, an additional acceleration proportional to m/M would
rise either for an observer at the centre of mass of the system, or for an
observer at a fixed distance from the centre of mass of M. These elementary,
but overlooked, considerations fully respect the equivalence principle and the
identity of an inertial or a gravitational pull for an observer in the Einstein
cabin. They value as fore-runners of the self-force and gauge dependency in
general relativity. The approximate nature of Galilei's law of free fall is
explored herein. When stepping into general relativity, we report how the
geodesic free fall into a black hole was the subject of an intense debate again
centred on coordinate choice. Later, we describe how the infalling mass and the
emitted gravitational radiation affect the free fall motion of a body. The
general relativistic self-force might be dealt with to perfectly fit into a
geodesic conception of motion. Then, embracing quantum mechanics, real black
holes are not classical static objects any longer. Free fall has to handle the
Hawking radiation, and leads us to new perspectives on the varying mass of the
evaporating black hole and on the varying energy of the falling mass. Along the
paper, we also estimate our findings for ordinary masses being dropped from a
Galilean or Einsteinian Pisa-like tower with respect to the current state of
the art drawn from precise measurements in ground and space laboratories, and
to the constraints posed by quantum measurements. The appendix describes how
education physics and high impact factor journals discuss the free fall.
Finally, case studies conducted on undergraduate students and teachers are

more profit than in homogeneous pricing settings, and (iii) subsequently
transfer some of the extra profit to cyber-insurance agencies to make insurance

approach for explaining the accelerated expansion of the Universe and to build
high energy completions of the theory of gravity. The presence of such new
degrees of freedom is, however, tightly constrained from several observations
and experiments that aim to test general relativity in a wide range of scales.
The viability of a given modified theory of gravity, therefore, strongly
depends on the existence of a screening mechanism that suppresses the extra
degrees of freedom. We perform simulations, and find that waves propagating in
the new degrees of freedom can significantly impact the efficiency of some
screening mechanisms, thereby threatening the viability of these modified
gravity theories. Specifically, we show that the waves produced in the
symmetron model can increase the amplitude of the fifth force and the
parametrized post-Newtonian parameters by several orders of magnitude.

interest recently in the quest for a viable alternative to General Relativity
on cosmological scales, given their intrinsic property of being able to pass
Solar System scale tests and, at the same time, to possibly drive universe
acceleration on much larger scales. Here, we explore the possibility that the
same screening mechanism, or its breaking at a certain astrophysical scale,
might be responsible of those gravitational effects which, in the context of
general relativity, are generally attributed to Dark Matter. We consider a
recently proposed extension of covariant Galileon models in the so-called
""beyond Horndeski"" scenario, where a breaking of the Vainshtein mechanism is
possible and, thus, some peculiar observational signatures should be detectable
and make it distinguishable from general relativity. We apply this model to a
sample of clusters of galaxies observed under the \textit{CLASH} survey, using
both new data from gravitational lensing events and archival data from X-ray
intra-cluster hot gas observations. In particular, we use the latter to model
the gas density, and then use it as the only ingredient in the matter clusters'
budget to calculate the expected lensing convergence map. Results show that, in
the context of this extended Galileon, the assumption of having only gas and no
Dark Matter at all in the clusters is able to match observations. We also
obtain narrow and very interesting bounds on the parameters which characterize
this model. In particular, we find that, at least for one of them, the general
relativity limit is excluded at $2\sigma$ confidence level, thus making this
model clearly statistically different and competitive with respect to general
relativity.

generality, including a classification of Gaussian (also known as
""general-dyne"") quantum measurements. In doing so, we will give a compact proof
for the parametrisation of the most general Gaussian completely positive map,
which we believe to be missing in the existing literature. We will then move on
to consider the linear coupling with a white noise bath, and derive the
diffusion equations that describe the evolution of Gaussian states under such
circumstances. Starting from these equations, we outline a constructive method
to derive general master equations that apply outside the Gaussian regime.
Next, we include the general-dyne monitoring of the environmental degrees of
freedom and recover the Riccati equation for the conditional evolution of
Gaussian states. Our derivation relies exclusively on the standard quantum
mechanical update of the system state, through the evaluation of Gaussian
overlaps. The parametrisation of the conditional dynamics we obtain is novel
and, at variance with existing alternatives, directly ties in to physical
detection schemes. We conclude our study with two examples of conditional
dynamics that can be dealt with conveniently through our formalism,
demonstrating how monitoring can suppress the noise in optical parametric
processes as well as stabilise systems subject to diffusive scattering.

variety of research areas, including economics, insurance and finance, where
modelling with heavy-tailed distributions is of pivotal importance. In such
situations, naturally, the classical Pearson correlation coefficient is of
little use. On the other hand, it has been observed that when light-tailed
situations are of interest, and hence when both the Gini-type and Pearson
correlation coefficients are well-defined and finite, then these coefficients
are related and sometimes even coincide. In general, understanding how the
correlation coefficients above are related has been an illusive task. In this
paper we put forward arguments that establish such a connection via certain
regression-type equations. This, in turn, allows us to introduce a Gini-type
Weighted Insurance Pricing Model that works in heavy-tailed situation and thus
provides a natural alternative to the classical Capital Asset Pricing Model. We
illustrate our theoretical considerations using several bivariate
distributions, such as elliptical and those with heavy-tailed Pareto margins.

  Aims: We estimate time-lags as accurately as possible and fit them with

the geometry of the X-ray emitting region in AGN.
  Methods: We used all available archival \textit{XMM-Newton} data for the

$2-4\,\mathrm{keV}$ energy bands. We used these light curves and applied a
thoroughly tested (through extensive numerical simulations) recipe to estimate
time-lags that have minimal bias, approximately follow a Gaussian distribution,
and have known errors. Using traditional $\chi^2$ minimisation techniques, we
then fitted the observed time-lags with two different models: a
phenomenological model where the time-lags have a power-law dependence on
frequency, and a physical model, using the reverberation time-lags expected in
the lamp-post geometry. The latter were computed assuming a point-like primary
X-ray source above a black hole surrounded by a neutral and prograde accretion
disc with solar iron abundance. We took all relativistic effects into account

have been concentrated on the detailed analyses of individual, nearby sources.
A relatively small number of studies have treated the ensemble behaviour of the
more general AGN population in wider regions of the luminosity-redshift plane.
We want to determine the ensemble variability properties of a rich AGN sample,
called Multi-Epoch XMM Serendipitous AGN Sample (MEXSAS), extracted from the
fifth release of the XMM-Newton Serendipitous Source Catalogue (XMMSSC-DR5),
with redshift between 0.1 and 5, and X-ray luminosities in the 0.5-4.5 keV band
between 10^42 and 10^47 erg/s. We urge caution on the use of the normalised
excess variance (NXS), noting that it may lead to underestimate variability if
used improperly. We use the structure function (SF), updating our previous
analysis for a smaller sample. We propose a correction to the NXS variability
estimator, accounting for the light curve duration in the rest frame on the
basis of the knowledge of the variability behaviour gained by SF studies. We
find an ensemble increase of the X-ray variability with the rest-frame time lag
tau, given by tau^0.12. We confirm an inverse dependence on the X-ray
luminosity, approximately as L_X^-0.19. We analyse the SF in different X-ray
bands, finding a dependence of the variability on the frequency as nu^-0.15,
corresponding to a softer when brighter trend. In turn, this dependence allows
us to parametrically correct the variability estimated in observer-frame bands
to that in the rest frame, resulting in a moderate shift upwards
(V-correction). Ensemble X-ray variability of AGNs is best described by the
structure function. An improper use of the normalised excess variance may lead
to an underestimate of the intrinsic variability, so that appropriate
corrections to the data or the models must be applied to prevent these effects.

real-valued function ${\mit \Omega}(u) \ge 0$ which is non-increasing and
decreases in infinity more rapidly than any exponential functions
$\exp\left(-\lambda u\right),\,\lambda >0$ possesses zeros only on the
imaginary axis. The Riemann zeta function $\zeta(s)$ as it is known can be
related to an entire function $\xi(s)$ with the same non-trivial zeros as
$\zeta(s)$. Then after a trivial argument displacement $s\leftrightarrow
z=s-\frac{1}{2}$ we relate it to a function ${\mit \Xi}(z)$ with a
representation of the form ${\mit \Xi}(z)=\int_{0}^{+\infty}du\,{\mit
\Omega}(u)\,{\rm ch}(uz)$ where ${\mit \Omega}(u)$ is rapidly decreasing in
infinity and satisfies all requirements necessary for the given proof of the
position of its zeros on the imaginary axis $z={\rm i} y$ by the second
mean-value theorem. Besides this theorem we apply the Cauchy-Riemann
differential equation in an integrated operator form derived in the Appendix B.
All this means that we prove a theorem for zeros of ${\mit \Xi}(z)$ on the
imaginary axis $z={\rm i} y$ for a whole class of function ${\mit \Omega}(u)$
which includes in this way the proof of the Riemann hypothesis. This whole
class includes, in particular, the modified Bessel functions ${\rm I}_{\nu}(z)$
for which it is known that their zeros lie on the imaginary axis and which
affirms our conclusions. A class of almost-periodic functions to piece-wise
constant nonincreasing functions ${\rm \Omega}(u)$ belongs also to this case.
At the end we give shortly an equivalent way of a more formal description of
the obtained results using the Mellin transform of functions with its variable
