states and chimera states in two interacting populations of nonlocally coupled
Stuart-Landau oscillators. We find that the complete synchronization in
population-I and existence of solitary oscillators which escape from the
synchronized group in population-II lead to imperfect synchronized states for
sufficiently small values of nonisochronicity parameter. Interestingly, on
increasing the strength of this parameter further there occurs an onset of
mixed imperfect synchronized states where the solitary oscillators occur from
both the populations. Synchronized oscillators from both the populations are
locked to a common average frequency. In both the cases of imperfect
synchronized states synchronized oscillators exhibit periodic motion while the
solitary oscillators are quasi-periodic in nature. In this region, for
spatially prepared initial conditions, we can observe the mixed chimera states
where the coexistence of synchronized and desynchronized oscillations occur
from both the populations. On the other hand, imperfect synchronized states are
not always stable, and they can drift aperiodically due to instability caused
by an increase of nonisochronicity parameter. We observe that these states are
robust to the introduction of frequency mismatch between the two populations.

used. The critical task involved in mixture modelling is to determine the
optimal number of component probability distributions. We employ the Bayesian

mixture models by balancing the trade-off between the model's complexity and
its goodness-of-fit to the data. We consider the problem of modelling angular

distributions. The main contributions of the paper include the development of
the mixture modelling apparatus along with the MML estimation of the parameters
of the BVM distribution. We demonstrate that statistical inference using the

show that on-shell the field carries one single irreducible unitary
representation of the Poincar\'e group for a continuous spin particle. We also
show how the field can be used to build a set of covariant equations found by
Wigner describing the wave function of one-particle states for a continuous

continuous spin particle to a background abelian gauge field, and make some

one state and one control variable, from a physicist's point of view. By using
an analogy to a physical model, we study this system in the classical and
quantum frameworks. Classically, the dynamic optimization problem is equivalent
to a classical mechanics constrained system, so we must use the Dirac method to
analyze it in a correct way. We find that there are two second-class
constraints in the model: one fix the momenta associated with the control
variables, and the other is a reminder of the optimal control law. The dynamic
evolution of this constrained system is given by the Dirac's bracket of the
canonical variables with the Hamiltonian. This dynamic results to be identical
to the unconstrained one given by the Pontryagin equations, which are the
correct classical equations of motion for our physical optimization problem. In
the same Pontryagin scheme, by imposing a closed-loop $\lambda$-strategy, the
optimality condition for the action gives a consistency relation, which is
associated to the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation of the dynamic programming
method. A similar result is achieved by quantizing the classical model. By
setting the wave function $\Psi(x,t) = e^{iS(x,t)}$ in the quantum
Schr\""odinger equation, a non-linear partial equation is obtained for the $S$
function. For the right-hand side quantization, this is the
Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation, when $S(x,t)$ is identified with the optimal
value function. Thus, the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation in Bellman's maximum
principle, can be interpreted as the quantum approach of the optimization
problem.

the high energy extreme. The properties of the heat pulses are difficult to
constrain. Here hydrodynamic loop modeling shows that several large amplitude
oscillations (~ 20% in density) are triggered in flare light curves if the
duration of the heat pulse is shorter that the sound crossing time of the
flaring loop. The reason is that the plasma has not enough time to reach
pressure equilibrium during the heating and traveling pressure fronts develop.
The period is a few minutes for typical solar coronal loops, dictated by the
sound crossing time in the decay phase. The long period and large amplitude
make these oscillations different from typical MHD waves. This diagnostic can
be applied both to observations of solar and stellar flares and to future
observations of non-flaring loops at high resolution.

along with related results. We also improve their later result showing a lower
bound on the edge expansion on random lifts. Our proofs rely on new ideas from
group theory which make several improvements possible. We exactly calculate the
probability that a random lift of a connected graph with first Betti number $l$
is connected by showing that it is equal to the probability that a subgroup of
the symmetric group generated by $l$ random elements is transitive. We also
calculate the probability that a subgroup of a wreath product of symmetric

of homotopy invariants in random covering graphs which reduces some of their
properties to those of random regular multigraphs, and in particular makes it
possible to compute the exact probability with which random regular multigraphs

point group while exhibiting superconducting transition temperatures as high as
$T_c\sim 3.5$ and $\sim 4.7 $ K, respectively. Disorder was claimed to lead to
the extremely large upper critical fields ($H_{c2}$) observed in related
compounds. Despite the presence of disorder and heavier elements, $H_{c2}$s in
Ta$_4$Pd$_3$Te$_{16}$ are found to be considerably smaller than those of
Nb$_3$Pd$_x$Se$_7$ while displaying an anomalous, non-saturating linear
dependence on temperature $T$ for fields along all three crystallographic axes.
In contrast, crystals of the latter compound displaying the highest $T_c$s
display $H_{c2}\propto (1-T/T_c)^{1/2}$, which in monolayers of transition
metal dichalcogenides is claimed to be evidence for an Ising paired
superconducting state resulting from strong spin-orbit coupling. This anomalous
$T$-dependence indicates that the superconducting state of Nb$_3$Pd$_x$Se$_7$
is quasi-two-dimensional in nature. This is further supported by a nearly
divergent anisotropy in upper-critical fields, i.e. $\gamma=
H_{c2}^{b}/H_{c2}^{a^{\prime}}$, upon approaching $T_c$. Hence, in
Nb$_3$Pd$_x$Se$_7$ the increase of $T_c$ correlates with a marked reduction in
electronic dimensionality as observed, for example, in intercalated FeSe. For
the Nb compound, Density functional theory (DFT) calculations indicate that an
increase in the external field produces an anisotropic orbital response, with
especially strong polarization at the Pd sites when the field is perpendicular
to their square planar environment. Therefore, DFT suggests the field-induced
pinning of the spin to the lattice as a possible mechanism for decoupling the
superconducting planes. Overall, our observations represent further evidence
for unconventional superconductivity in the Pd chalcogenides.

maximize the weighted sum-utility of all the users and obtain a Pareto optimal

consider the case where the users can cooperate with each other so as to
disagree with the policy which will be unfair to individual user. We then
obtain a Nash bargaining solution, which in addition to being Pareto optimal,
is also fair to each user.

photons transmitted through optical fibers to entangle individual network
nodes. To extend communication distances and overcome limitations due to photon
absorption in fibers the concept of quantum repeaters has been proposed. For
that purpose, it is required to achieve quantum correlations between the
material nodes and photons at telecom wavelengths which can be sent over long
distances in optical fibers. Here we demonstrate non-classical correlation
between a frequency converted telecom C-band photon and a spin-wave stored in
an atomic ensemble quantum memory. The photons emitted from the ensemble and
heralding the spin-waves are converted from 780 nm to 1552 nm by means of an
all-solid-state integrated waveguide non-linear device. We show ultra-low noise
operation of the device enabling a high signal to noise ratio of the converted
single photon, leading to a high spin-wave heralding efficiency. The presented
work is an enabling step towards the practical entanglement of remote quantum
memories and the entanglement of quantum systems operating at different
wavelengths.

with $\beta = 6$. The starting point of our analysis is the recent work of I.
Rumanov where he produces a Lax-pair representation for the Bloemendal-Vir\'ag
equation. The latter is a linear PDE which describes the Tracy-Widom functions
corresponding to general values of $\beta$. Using his Lax pair, Rumanov derives
an explicit formula for the Tracy-Widom $\beta=6$ function in terms of the
second Painlev\'e transcendent and the solution of an auxiliary ODE. Rumanov
also shows that this formula allows him to derive formally the asymptotic
expansion of the Tracy-Widom function. Our goal is to make Rumanov's approach
and hence the asymptotic analysis it provides rigorous. In this paper, the
first one in a sequel, we show that Rumanov's Lax-pair can be interpreted as a
certain gauge transformation of the standard Lax pair for the second Painlev\'e
equation. This gauge transformation though contains functional parameters which
are defined via some auxiliary nonlinear ODE which is equivalent to the
auxiliary ODE of Rumanov's formula. The gauge-interpretation of Rumanov's
Lax-pair allows us to highlight the steps of the original Rumanov's method
which needs rigorous justifications in order to make the method complete. We
provide a rigorous justification of one of these steps. Namely, we prove that
the Painlev\'e function involved in Rumanov's formula is indeed, as it has been
suggested by Rumanov, the Hastings-McLeod solution of the second Painlev\'e
equation. The key issue which we also discuss and which is still open is the
question of integrability of the auxiliary ODE in Rumanov's formula. We note
that this question is crucial for the rigorous asymptotic analysis of the
Tracy-Widom function.

on vortices in superfluids put into periodic potentials at $T=0$. The case of
weak potential and the tight-binding limit described by the Bose-Hubbard model
were addressed. The analysis was based on the balance of true momentum and
quasimomentum. A special attention was paid to the superfluid close to the
superfluid-insulator transition. In this area of the phase diagram the theory
predicts the particle-hole symmetry line where the Magnus force changes sign
with respect to that expected from the sign of velocity circulation. Our
analysis has shown that the magnitude of the Magnus force is a continuous
function at crossing the particle-hole symmetry line. This challenges the
theory connecting the magnitude of the Magnus force with topological Chern
numbers and predicting a jump at crossing this line. Disagreement is explained
by the role of intrinsic pinning and guided vortex motion ignored in the
topological approach. It is one more evidence that in general topological
arguments are not sufficient for derivation of equations of vortex motion.

dependence described by Legendre polynomials. We examine the imprints left by
curvature trispectra on the $TT\mu$ bispectrum, generated by the correlation
between temperature anisotropies (T) and chemical potential spectral
distortions ($\mu$) of the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB). Due to the
angular dependence of the primordial signal, the corresponding $TT\mu$
bispectrum strongly differs in shape from $TT\mu$ sourced by the usual $g_{\rm

the quadrupolar Legendre coefficient is $d_2 \sim 0.01$, which is 4 orders of
magnitude better than the best value attainable from the $TTTT$ CMB
trispectrum. In the case of an anisotropic inflationary model with a
$f(\phi)F^2$ interaction (coupling the inflaton field $\phi$ with a vector

presented in this paper. The general expansion to the second order is derived.
The second order expansion is considered as a small correction to the first
order expansion. Using this approach it is demonstrated that the second order
expansion is reducible to a first order expansion via a re-definition of the
first order pertubative fields. Even if in practice the second order correction
is small the reducibility of the second order expansion to the first order
expansion indicates a degeneracy problem. In general this degeneracy is hard to
break. A useful and simple second order approximation is the thin source
approximation which offers a direct estimation of the correction. The practical
application of the corrections derived in this paper are illustrated by using
an elliptical NFW lens model. The second order pertubative expansion provides a
noticeable improvement, even for the simplest case of thin source
approximation. To conclude it is clear that for accurate modelisation of
gravitational lenses using the perturbative method the second order
perturbative expansion should be considered. In particular an evaluation of the
degeneracy due to the second order term should be performed, for which the thin
source approximation is particularly useful.

perturbation theory has played a central role in natural sciences. Particularly
in quantum mechanics, the amount of information needed for specifying the state
of a many-body system commonly scales exponentially as the system size. This
poses a fundamental difficulty in using perturbation theory at arbitrary order.
As one computes the terms in the perturbation series at increasingly higher
orders, it is often important to determine whether the series converges and if
so, what is an accurate estimation of the total error that comes from the next
order of perturbation up to infinity. Here we present a set of efficient
algorithms that compute tight upper bounds to perturbation terms at arbitrary
order. We argue that these tight bounds often take the form of symmetric
polynomials on the parameter of the quantum system. We then use cellular
automata as our basic model of computation to compute the symmetric polynomials
that account for all of the virtual transitions at any given order. At any

copulas. Our special focus is estimating expectations over multi-dimensional
constrained sets that have a small implied measure under the Gaussian copula.
We propose three estimators, all of which rely on a simple idea: identify
certain \emph{dominating} point(s) of the feasible set, and appropriately shift
and scale an exponential distribution for subsequent use within an importance
sampling measure. As we show, the efficiency of such estimators depends
crucially on the local structure of the feasible set around the dominating
points. The first of our proposed estimators $\estOpt$ is the
""full-information"" estimator that actively exploits such local structure to
achieve bounded relative error in Gaussian settings. The second and third
estimators $\estExp$, $\estLap$ are ""partial-information"" estimators, for use
when complete information about the constraint set is not available, they do
not exhibit bounded relative error but are shown to achieve polynomial
efficiency. We provide sharp asymptotics for all three estimators. For the
NORTA setting where no ready information about the dominating points or the
feasible set structure is assumed, we construct a multinomial mixture of the
partial-information estimator $\estLap$ resulting in a fourth estimator
$\estNt$ with polynomial efficiency, and implementable through the ecoNORTA
algorithm. Numerical results on various example problems are remarkable, and
consistent with theory.

turbulence, that spontaneously occurs at zero-Reynolds number in fluidized
biological systems. This spatio-temporal disordered flow radically changes
nutrient and molecular transport in living fluids and can strongly affect the
collective behaviour in prominent biological processes, including biofilm
formation, morphogenesis and cancer invasion. Despite its crucial role in such
physiological processes, understanding meso-scale turbulence and any relation
to classical inertial turbulence remains obscure. Here, we show how the motion
of active matter along a micro-channel transitions to meso-scale turbulence
through the evolution of disordered patches (active puffs) from an absorbing
state of flow vortex-lattices. We demonstrate that the critical behaviour of
this transition to meso-scale turbulence in a channel belongs to the directed
percolation universality class. This finding bridges our understanding of the
onset of zero-Reynolds number meso-scale turbulence and traditional
scale-invariant turbulence, therefore generalizing theories on the onset of
turbulence in confinement to the distinct classes of incoherent flows observed
in biological fluids.

  How Protostars and Strong Rotators Lose their Angular Momentum Fast",,,,,"physics.plasm-ph astro-ph.SR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The effects of the stellar rotation and the consequent azimuthal stellar wind
flow in Parker's [9] hydrodynamic stellar wind model are discussed. Of special
interest is the emergence of a whole new hydrodynamic physics via a new
critical point in the stellar wind flow, which supersedes the critical point in
Parker's [9] hydrodynamic model. The effect of the stellar rotation is shown to
cause the new critical point to occur lower in the corona, so the stellar wind
experiences a stronger afterburner (as in an aircraft jet engine) action in the
corona. For strong rotators, the new critical point is shown to occur at a
fixed location for a given star, determined only by the basic stellar
parameters like the mass M and the angular velocity, the variations in the
stellar wind environment notwithstanding. The stellar rotation leads to
stronger density fall-off and enhanced acceleration of the stellar wind at
large distances from the star - this effect materializes even close to the
star, for strong rotators. The stellar rotation causes the physical throat
section of the effective de Laval nozzle associated with the stellar wind flow
to become narrower, indicative of an enhanced flow acceleration. Thus, the
stellar rotation leads to tenuous and faster stellar wind flows without change
in the mass flux, and hence provides an efficient physical mechanism for
protostars and strong rotators to lose their angular momentum quickly.

\emph{content providers}) capture an increased focus. While the type of content
varies, e.g.\ movies, articles, music, advertisements, etc., the high level
problem remains the same. Based on knowledge obtained so far on the user,
recommend the most desired content. In this paper we present a method to handle
the well known user-cold-start problem in recommendation systems. In this
scenario, a recommendation system encounters a new user and the objective is to
present items as relevant as possible with the hope of keeping the user's
session as long as possible. We formulate an optimization problem aimed to
maximize the length of this initial session, as this is believed to be the key
to have the user come back and perhaps register to the system. In particular,
our model captures the fact that a single round with low quality recommendation
is likely to terminate the session. In such a case, we do not proceed to the
next round as the user leaves the system, possibly never to seen again. We
denote this phenomenon a \emph{One-Shot Session}. Our optimization problem is
formulated as an MDP where the action space is of a combinatorial nature as we
recommend in each round, multiple items. This huge action space presents a
computational challenge making the straightforward solution intractable. We
analyze the structure of the MDP to prove monotone and submodular like
properties that allow a computationally efficient solution via a method denoted
by \emph{Greedy Value Iteration} (G-VI).

minimum receiver-side power constraint in addition to the usual maximum
transmitter-side power constraint. This problem is motivated by energy
harvesting communications with wireless energy transfer, where an added goal is
to deliver a minimum amount of energy to a receiver in addition to delivering
secure data to another receiver. In this paper, we characterize the exact
secrecy capacity of the MIMO wiretap channel under transmitter and
receiver-side power constraints. We first show that solving this problem is
equivalent to solving the secrecy capacity of the wiretap channel under a
double-sided correlation matrix constraint on the channel input. We show the
converse by extending the channel enhancement technique to our case. We present
two achievable schemes that achieve the secrecy capacity: the first achievable
scheme uses a Gaussian codebook with a fixed mean, and the second achievable
scheme uses artificial noise (or cooperative jamming) together with a Gaussian
codebook. The role of the mean or the artificial noise is to enable energy
transfer without sacrificing from the secure rate. This is the first instance
of a channel model where either the use of a mean signal or the use of channel
prefixing via artificial noise is strictly necessary for the MIMO wiretap
channel. We then extend our work to consider a maximum receiver-side power
constraint. This problem is motivated by cognitive radio applications, where an
added goal is to decrease the received signal energy (interference temperature)
at a receiver. We further extend our results to: requiring receiver-side power
constraints at both receivers; considering secrecy constraints at both
receivers to study broadcast channels with confidential messages; and removing
the secrecy constraints to study the classical broadcast channel.

these translinear scales, so that analysis with the standard power spectrum
cannot access the information contained in these small-scale modes. The log

otherwise lost information. Until now there has been no means of predicting the
amplitude of the log power spectrum apart from cataloging the results of

that generic fermion condensation obeys a Hierarchy Principle by which it can
be decomposed into a boson condensation followed by a minimal fermion
condensation, which involves a single self-fermion that is its own
anti-particle and has unit quantum dimension. We then develop the rules of
minimal fermion condensation, which together with the known rules of boson
condensation, provides a full set of rules of fermion condensation. Our studies

Since the images of gravitationally lensed quasars are the superposition of
multiple point sources and a foreground lensing galaxy, we have developed a
morphology independent multi-wavelength approach to the photometric selection
of lensed quasar candidates based on Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM) supervised
machine learning. Using this technique and $gi$ multicolour photometric
observations from the Dark Energy Survey (DES), near IR $JK$ photometry from

identified a candidate system with two catalogue components with $i_{AB}=18.61$
and $i_{AB}=20.44$ comprised of an elliptical galaxy and two blue point
sources. Spectroscopic follow-up with NTT and the use of an archival AAT
spectrum show that the point sources can be identified as a lensed quasar with
an emission line redshift of $z=2.739\pm0.003$ and a foreground early type
galaxy with $z=0.400\pm0.002$. We model the system as a single isothermal

empirically motivated prescriptions for the IMF to make predictions for how the

find that the IMF normalization of individual galaxies becomes lighter with

with redshift. Current constraints on the evolution of the IMF are in slight
tension with this prediction, even though systematic uncertainties prevent a
conclusive statement. The correlation of $\alpha_{IMF}$ with stellar mass
becomes shallower with time, while the correlation between $\alpha_{IMF}$ and
velocity dispersion is mostly preserved by dry mergers. We also find that dry
mergers can mix the dependence of the IMF on stellar mass and velocity
dispersion, making it challenging to infer, from $z=0$ observations of global
galactic properties, what is the quantity that is originally coupled with the

compare the scaling of global momentum and heat transfer. The scaling exponents
are found to be in agreement with experiments. Mean profiles of the
root-mean-square velocity as well as the thermal and kinetic energy dissipation
rates have growing amplitudes with decreasing Prandtl number which underlies a
more vigorous bulk turbulence in the low-Pr regime. The skin-friction
coefficient displays a Reynolds-number dependence that is close to that of an
isothermal, intermittently turbulent velocity boundary layer. The thermal
boundary layer thicknesses are larger as Pr decreases and conversely the
velocity boundary layer thicknesses become smaller. We investigate the scaling
exponents and find a slight decrease in exponent magnitude for the thermal
boundary layer thickness as Pr decreases, but find the opposite case for the
velocity boundary layer thickness scaling. A growing area fraction of turbulent
patches close to the heating and cooling plates can be detected by exceeding a
locally defined shear Reynolds number threshold. This area fraction is larger
for lower Pr at the same Ra. Our analysis of the kurtosis of the locally
defined shear Reynolds number demonstrates that the intermittency in the
boundary layer is significantly increased for the lower Prandtl number and for
sufficiently high Rayleigh number compared to convection in air. This
complements our previous findings of enhanced bulk intermittency in

magnitude of this decrease varies directly with the mean free path: shorter
mean free paths correspond with stronger anti-Q-slopes. We draw a theoretical
connection between the mean free path and the overheating of the
quasiparticles, which leads to the reduction of the anti-Q-slope towards the
normal Q-slope of long-mean-free-path cavities. We also investigate the
sensitivity of the residual resistance to trapped magnetic flux, a property
which is greatly enhanced for doped cavities, and calculate an optimal doping
regime for a given amount of trapped flux.

function fields in positive characteristic, which today are called Hodge-Pink

field. He has defined Hodge realization functors from the uniformizable abelian
$t$-modules and $t$-motives of Greg Anderson to Hodge-Pink structures. This
allows one to associate with each uniformizable $t$-motive a Hodge-Pink group,
analogous to the Mumford-Tate group of a smooth projective variety over the
complex numbers. It further enabled Pink to prove the analog of the
Mumford-Tate Conjecture for Drinfeld modules. Moreover, based on unpublished

thesis that the Hodge-Pink group equals the motivic Galois group of the
$t$-motive as defined by Papanikolas and Taelman. This yields a precise analog
of the famous Hodge Conjecture, which is an outstanding open problem for
varieties over the complex numbers.

This represents, for two closed curves, the number of times that each curve
winds around the other. We show that closing the curves is not necessary, as a
novel parameter $G'$, termed Gaussian entanglement, is strongly correlated with
the linking number. Based on $110$ non redundant domain-swapped dimers, our
analysis evidences a high fraction of chains with a significant intertwining,

negative mutual entanglement and surprisingly, it seems to suppress

However, generating a pencil beam from 2D LWAs is not straightforward and due
care has to be taken for the design of the LWA. On the other hand,
transmission-line (TL) grids have demonstrated interesting behaviors, such as
an effective negative refractive index and growing of evanescent waves. In this
paper, a singlepoint-fed TL-grid 2D Dirac leaky-wave antenna (DLWA) design is
proposed that generates a pencil beam at both broadside and slightly tilted
angles. The TL-grid unit cell is analytically treated in light of its
scattering and impedance matrices. The optimized TL-grid unit cell is shown to
exhibit a closed bandgap in the dispersion relation which is also linearly
varying with frequency (hence it is a DLWA). The proposed 2D DLWA design is
fabricated and the experimental results are presented.

of Gaussian Half-Duplex (HD) diamond networks. Specifically, given an $N$-relay
diamond network, this problem seeks to derive fundamental guarantees on the
capacity of the best $k$-relay subnetwork, as a function of the full network
capacity. The main focus of this work is on the case when $k=N-1$ relays are
selected out of the $N$ possible ones. First, a simple algorithm, which removes
the relay with the minimum capacity (i.e., the worst relay), is analyzed and it
is shown that the remaining $(N-1)$-relay subnetwork has an approximate (i.e.,
optimal up to a constant gap) HD capacity that is at least half of the
approximate HD capacity of the full network. This fraction guarantee is shown
to be tight if only the single relay capacities are known, i.e., there exists a
class of Gaussian HD diamond networks with $N$ relays where, by removing the
worst relay, the subnetwork of the remaining $k=N-1$ relays has an approximate
capacity equal to half of the approximate capacity of the full network. Next,
this work proves a fundamental guarantee, which improves over the previous
fraction: there always exists a subnetwork of $k=N-1$ relays that achieves at
least a fraction $\frac{N-1}{N}$ of the approximate capacity of the full
network. This fraction is proved to be tight and it is shown that any optimal
schedule of the full network can be used by at least one of the $N$ subnetworks
of $N-1$ relays to achieve a worst-case performance guarantee of
$\frac{N-1}{N}$. Additionally, these results are extended to derive lower
bounds on the fraction guarantee for general $k \in [1:N]$. The key steps in
the proofs lie in the derivation of properties of submodular functions, which
provide a combinatorial handle on the network simplification problem in
Gaussian HD diamond networks.

GASS 3505 has experienced a minor merger in the recent past. We investigate the

heterogeneous, multi-scale cellular populations. We illustrate our methodology
with a particular example in which we study a population with an
oxygen-regulated proliferation rate. Our formulation is based on an
age-dependent stochastic process. Cells within the population are characterised
by their age. The age-dependent (oxygen-regulated) birth rate is given by a
stochastic model of oxygen-dependent cell cycle progression. We then formulate
an age-dependent birth-and-death process, which dictates the time evolution of
the cell population. The population is under a feedback loop which controls its
steady state size: cells consume oxygen which in turns fuels cell
proliferation. We show that our stochastic model of cell cycle progression
allows for heterogeneity within the cell population induced by stochastic
effects. Such heterogeneous behaviour is reflected in variations in the
proliferation rate. Within this set-up, we have established three main results.
First, we have shown that the age to the G1/S transition, which essentially
determines the birth rate, exhibits a remarkably simple scaling behaviour. This
allows for a huge simplification of our numerical methodology. A further result
is the observation that heterogeneous populations undergo an internal process
of quasi-neutral competition. Finally, we investigated the effects of
cell-cycle-phase dependent therapies (such as radiation therapy) on
heterogeneous populations. In particular, we have studied the case in which the
population contains a quiescent sub-population. Our mean-field analysis and
numerical simulations confirm that, if the survival fraction of the therapy is
too high, rescue of the quiescent population occurs. This gives rise to
emergence of resistance to therapy since the rescued population is less
sensitive to therapy.

$\geq$ 6 after the first round (2012-2014) of observations for the
LAMOST-Kepler project (LK-project). By adopting the upgraded version of the
LAMOST Stellar Parameter pipeline (LASP), we have determined the atmospheric
parameters ($T_{\rm eff}$ , $\log g$, and $\rm [Fe/H]$) and heliocentric radial
velocity $v_{\rm rad}$ for 51,406 stars with 61,226 spectra. Compared with
atmospheric parameters derived from both high-resolution spectroscopy and
asteroseismology method for common stars in Huber et al. (2014), an external
calibration of LASP atmospheric parameters was made, leading to the
determination of external errors for the giants and dwarfs, respectively.
Multiple spectroscopic observations for the same objects of the LK-project were
used to estimate the internal uncertainties of the atmospheric parameters as a
function of SNR$_g$ with the unbiased estimation method. The LASP atmospheric
parameters were calibrated based on both the external and internal
uncertainties for the giants and dwarfs, respectively. A general statistical
analysis of the stellar parameters leads to discovery of 106 candidate
metal-poor stars, 9 candidate very metal-poor stars, and 18 candidate
high-velocity stars. Fitting formulae were obtained segmentally for both the
calibrated atmospheric parameters of the LK-project and the KIC parameters with
the common stars. The calibrated atmospheric parameters and radial velocities
of the LK-project will be useful for studying stars in the Kepler field.

the inherent Kerr nonlinearity-modulated coupling between clockwise (CW) and

cosmology. This occurs via local formation of bubbles of true vacuum with their
subsequent rapid expansion. It can be considered as a relativistic analog of a
first-order phase transition in condensed matter. Here we expand upon our
recent proposal [EPL 110, 56001 (2015)] for an experimental test of false
vacuum decay using an ultra-cold spinor Bose gas. A false vacuum for the
relative phase of two spin components, serving as the unstable scalar field, is
generated by means of a modulated linear coupling of the spin components. We
analyze the system theoretically using the functional integral approach and
show that various microscopic degrees of freedom in the system, albeit leading
to dissipation in the relative phase sector, will not hamper the observation of
the false vacuum decay in the laboratory. This is well supported by numerical
simulations demonstrating the spontaneous formation of true vacuum bubbles on
millisecond time-scales in two-component $^{7}$Li or $^{41}$K bosonic
condensates in one-dimensional traps of $\sim100\,\mu \mathrm{m}$ size.

corrupted by additive white Gaussian noise, where the cost function is taken to
be the Minimum Mean $p$-th Error (MMPE), is considered. The classical Minimum
Mean Square Error (MMSE) is a special case of the MMPE. Several bounds,
properties and applications of the MMPE are derived and discussed. The optimal
MMPE estimator is found for Gaussian and binary input distributions. Properties
of the MMPE as a function of the input distribution, SNR and order $p$ are
derived. In particular, it is shown that the MMPE is a continuous function of
$p$ and SNR. These results are possible in view of interpolation and change of
measure bounds on the MMPE. The `Single-Crossing-Point Property' (SCPP) that
bounds the MMSE for all SNR values {\it above} a certain value, at which the
MMSE is known, together with the I-MMSE relationship is a powerful tool in
deriving converse proofs in information theory. By studying the notion of
conditional MMPE, a unifying proof (i.e., for any $p$) of the SCPP is shown. A
complementary bound to the SCPP is then shown, which bounds the MMPE for all
SNR values {\it below} a certain value, at which the MMPE is known. As a first
application of the MMPE, a bound on the conditional differential entropy in
terms of the MMPE is provided, which then yields a generalization of the
Ozarow-Wyner lower bound on the mutual information achieved by a discrete input
on a Gaussian noise channel. As a second application, the MMPE is shown to
improve on previous characterizations of the phase transition phenomenon that
manifests, in the limit as the length of the capacity achieving code goes to
infinity, as a discontinuity of the MMSE as a function of SNR. As a final
application, the MMPE is used to show bounds on the second derivative of mutual
information, that tighten previously known bounds.

fifth-generation (5G) wireless networks \& beyond. Motivated by the mounting
interest in the unmanned flying platforms of various types including unmanned
aerial vehicles (UAVs), drones, balloons, and
high-altitude/medium-altitude/low-altitude platforms (HAPs/MAPs/LAPs), which we
refer to as the networked flying platforms (NFPs), for providing communications
services and the recent advances in free-space optics (FSO), this article
investigates the feasibility of a novel vertical backhaul/fronthaul framework
where the NFPs transport the backhaul/fronthaul traffic between the access and
core networks via point-to-point FSO links. The performance of the proposed
innovative approach is investigated under different weather conditions and a
broad range of system parameters. Simulation results demonstrate that the
FSO-based vertical backhaul/fronthaul framework can offer data rates higher
than the baseline alternatives, and thus can be considered as a promising
solution to the emerging backhaul/fronthaul requirements of the 5G+ wireless
networks, particularly in the presence of ultra-dense heterogeneous small
cells. The paper also presents the challenges that accompany such a novel
framework and provides some key ideas towards overcoming these challenges.

fourth and sixth-order nonlinear elliptic equations that include p-Laplacian
terms on periodic domains in 2 and 3 dimensions. The highest and lowest order
terms of the equations are constant-coefficient, positive linear operators,
which suggests a natural preconditioning strategy. Such nonlinear elliptic
equations often arise from time discretization of parabolic equations that
model various biological and physical phenomena, in particular, liquid
crystals, thin film epitaxial growth and phase transformations. The analyses of
the schemes involve the characterization of the strictly convex energies
associated with the equations. We first give a general framework for PSD in
generic Hilbert spaces. Based on certain reasonable assumptions of the linear
pre-conditioner, a geometric convergence rate is shown for the nonlinear PSD
iteration. We then apply the general the theory to the fourth and sixth-order
problems of interest, making use of Sobolev embedding and regularity results to
confirm the appropriateness of our pre-conditioners for the regularized
p-Lapacian problems. Our results include a sharper theoretical convergence
result for p-Laplacian systems compared to what may be found in existing works.
We demonstrate rigorously how to apply the theory in the finite dimensional
setting using finite difference discretization methods. Numerical simulations
for some important physical application problems -- including thin film epitaxy
with slope selection and the square phase field crystal model -- are carried
out to verify the efficiency of the scheme.

silicon, the useful energy range of these optics was limited to fluorescence
emission below about 10 keV. Here, we report fabrication of CCAs from germanium

background reduction compared to silicon-based CCAs throughout this energy

finite-action Markov Decision Process (MDP) with K constraints, K-randimization
is sufficient to achieve the minimum cost. We found that the same result holds
for stochastic optimal control problems with continuous state and action

reduced cost when the optimization problem is nonconvex, and the cost reduction
is equal to the duality gap. We then provide the necessary and sufficient
conditions for the optimality of a randomized solution, and develop an
efficient solution method based on dual optimization. Furthermore, in a special

can be solved even more efficiently by root finding. Finally, we test the

have started to come together. Attosecond physics deals with phenomena
occurring when ultrashort laser pulses, with duration on the femto- and
sub-femtosecond time scales, interact with atoms, molecules or solids. The
laser-induced electron dynamics occurs natively on a timescale down to a few
hundred or even tens of attoseconds, which is comparable with the optical
field. On the other hand, the second branch involves the manipulation and
engineering of mesoscopic systems, such as solids, metals and dielectrics, with
nanometric precision. Although nano-engineering is a vast and well-established
research field on its own, the merger with intense laser physics is relatively
recent. In this article we present a comprehensive experimental and theoretical
overview of physics that takes place when short and intense laser pulses
interact with nanosystems, such as metallic and dielectric nanostructures. In
particular we elucidate how the spatially inhomogeneous laser induced fields at
a nanometer scale modify the laser-driven electron dynamics. Consequently, this
has important impact on pivotal processes such as ATI and HHG. The deep
understanding of the coupled dynamics between these spatially inhomogeneous
fields and matter configures a promising way to new avenues of research and
applications. Thanks to the maturity that attosecond physics has reached,
together with the tremendous advance in material engineering and manipulation
techniques, the age of atto-nano physics has begun, but it is in the initial
stage. We present thus some of the open questions, challenges and prospects for
experimental confirmation of theoretical predictions, as well as experiments
aimed at characterizing the induced fields and the unique electron dynamics
initiated by them with high temporal and spatial resolution.

interplay of continuous opinions and discrete behaviours. In our model, the
opinion of one individual is only influenced by the behaviours of fellow
individuals. The key technical difficulty in the study of these dynamics is
that the right-hand sides of the equations are discontinuous and thus their
solutions must be intended in some generalized sense: in our analysis, we
consider both Carath\'eodory and Krasowskii solutions. We first prove existence
and completeness of Carath\'eodory solutions from every initial condition and
we highlight a pathological behaviour of Carath\'eodory solutions, which can
converge to points that are not (Carath\'eodory) equilibria. Notably, such
points can be arbitrarily far from consensus and indeed simulations show that
convergence to non-consensus configurations is very common. In order to cope
with these pathological attractors, we then study Krasowskii solutions. We give
an estimate of the asymptotic distance of all Krasowskii solutions from
consensus and we prove its tightness via an example: this estimate is quadratic
in the number of agents, implying that quantization can drastically destroy
consensus. However, we are able to prove convergence to consensus in some
special cases, namely when the communication among the individuals is described
by either a complete or a complete bipartite graph.

density over a wide redshift range has become a popular observational method,
because it may trace the evolution of galaxies statistically. We test this
method by comparing the evolution of galaxies at fixed number density and by
following individual galaxies through cosmic time (z=0-5) in cosmological,
hydrodynamical simulations from OWLS. Comparing progenitors, descendants, and
galaxies selected at fixed number density at each redshift, we find differences
of up to a factor of three for galaxy and interstellar medium (ISM) masses. The
difference is somewhat larger for black hole masses. The scatter in ISM mass
increases significantly towards low redshift with all selection techniques. We
use the fixed number density technique to study the assembly of dark matter,
gas, stars, and black holes and the evolution in accretion and star formation
rates. We find three different regimes for massive galaxies, consistent with
observations: at high redshift the gas accretion rate dominates, at
intermediate redshifts the star formation rate is the highest, and at low
redshift galaxies grow mostly through mergers. Quiescent galaxies have much
lower ISM masses (by definition) and much higher black hole masses, but the
stellar and halo masses are fairly similar. Without active galactic nucleus
(AGN) feedback, massive galaxies are dominated by star formation down to z=0
and most of their stellar mass growth occurs in the centre. With AGN feedback,
stellar mass is only added to the outskirts of galaxies by mergers and they
grow inside-out.

system consists of an extended Kalman filter (EKF) based state estimation
algorithm that fuses information from a low cost MEMS inertial measurement unit
acquired at 200Hz and VGA resolution images from a monocular camera at 50Hz.
The dynamic model describing the quadrotor motion is employed in the estimation
algorithm as a third source of information. Visual information is incorporated
into the EKF by enforcing the epipolar constraint on features tracked between
image pairs, avoiding the need to explicitly estimate the location of the
tracked environmental features. Combined use of the dynamic model and epipolar
constraints makes it possible to obtain drift free velocity and attitude
estimates in the presence of both accelerometer and gyroscope biases. A
strategy to deal with the unobservability that arises when the quadrotor is in
hover is also provided. Experimental data from a real-time implementation of
the system on a 50 gram embedded computer are presented in addition to the
simulations to demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed system.

explore the phase diagram of strongly interacting matter. At LHC and top RHIC
energies, QCD matter is studied at very high temperatures and nearly vanishing
net-baryon densities. There is evidence that a Quark-Gluon-Plasma (QGP) was
created at experiments at RHIC and LHC. The transition from the QGP back to the
hadron gas is found to be a smooth cross over. For larger net-baryon densities
and lower temperatures, it is expected that the QCD phase diagram exhibits a
rich structure, such as a first-order phase transition between hadronic and
partonic matter which terminates in a critical point, or exotic phases like
quarkyonic matter. The discovery of these landmarks would be a breakthrough in
our understanding of the strong interaction and is therefore in the focus of
various high-energy heavy-ion research programs. The Compressed Baryonic Matter
(CBM) experiment at FAIR will play a unique role in the exploration of the QCD
phase diagram in the region of high net-baryon densities, because it is
designed to run at unprecedented interaction rates. High-rate operation is the
key prerequisite for high-precision measurements of multi-differential
observables and of rare diagnostic probes which are sensitive to the dense
phase of the nuclear fireball. The goal of the CBM experiment at SIS100
(sqrt(s_NN) = 2.7 - 4.9 GeV) is to discover fundamental properties of QCD
matter: the phase structure at large baryon-chemical potentials (mu_B > 500
MeV), effects of chiral symmetry, and the equation-of-state at high density as
it is expected to occur in the core of neutron stars. In this article, we
review the motivation for and the physics programme of CBM, including
activities before the start of data taking in 2022, in the context of the
worldwide efforts to explore high-density QCD matter.

lifetime, it can be necessary to operate laser away from the cathode center in
photoinjectors. In RF guns, the off-axis emitted beam will see a time-dependent
RF effect, which would generate a significant growth in transverse emittance.
It has been demonstrated that such an emittance growth can be almost completely
compensated by orienting the beam on a proper orbit in the downstream RF
cavities along the injector. In this paper we analyze in detail the simulation
techniques used in reference[1] and the issues associated with them. The
optimization of photoinjector systems involving off-axis beams is a challenging
problem. To solve this problem, one needs advanced simulation tools including
both genetic algorithms and an efficient algorithm for 3D space charge. In this
paper, we report on simulation studies where the two codes ASTRA and IMPACT-T
are used jointly to overcome these challenges, in order to optimize a system
designed to compensate for the emittance growth in a beam emitted off axis.

This framework has been applied to the study of higher educational institutions

UK). Additionally, the framework investigates the moderating effect of
Hofstedes four cultural dimensions at the individual level and a set of
individual differences (age, gender, experience and educational level) on the
key determinants that affect the behavioral intention to use e-learning. A
total of 1197 questionnaires were received from students who were using
web-based learning systems at higher educational institutions in Lebanon and
the UK with opposite scores on cultural dimensions. Confirmatory Factor
Analysis (CFA) was used to perform reliability and validity checks, and
Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) in conjunction with multi-group analysis

that individual, social, cultural and organizational factors are important to
consider in explaining students behavioral intention and usage of e-learning
environments. The findings of this research contribute to the literature by
validating and supporting the applicability of our extended TAM in the Lebanese

approximated by the surface currents induced on the strips by the field of the
rotating charge. The expressions are derived for the electric and magnetic
fields and for the angular density of the radiation intensity on a given
harmonic. We show that the interference between the synchrotron and
Smith-Purcell radiations may lead to interesting features. In particular, the
behavior of the radiation intensity on large harmonics can be essentially
different from that for a charge rotating in the vacuum or around a solid
cylinder. Unlike to these limiting cases, for the geometry of diffraction
grating the radiation intensity on higher harmonics does not vanish for small
angles with respect to the cylinder axis. For given characteristics of the
charge, by the choice of the parameters of the diffraction grating, one can
have highly directional radiation near the normal to the plane of the charge
rotation. With decreasing energy, the relative contribution of the synchrotron
radiation decreases and the Smith-Purcell part is dominant.

limitations of the `standard formulation of perturbation theory' ( SFPT). MFPT
is defined by developing perturbation about a chosen input Hamiltonian, which
is exactly solvable but which acquires the non-linearity and the analytic
structure~(in the coupling-strength)~of the original interaction through a
self-consistent, feedback mechanism. We demonstrate Borel-summability of MFPT

proteins. The adhesion bonds attract each other and often aggregate into large
clusters that are central to many biological processes. One possible origin of
attractive interactions between adhesion bonds is the elastic response of the
membranes to their deformation by the bonds. Here, we analyze these
elasticity-mediated interactions using a novel mean-field approach. Analysis of
systems at different densities of bonds, $\phi$, reveals that the phase diagram
exhibits a nearly-universal behavior when the temperature $T$ is plotted vs.
the scaled density $x=\phi \xi^2$, where $\xi$ is the linear size of the
membrane's region affected by a single bond. The critical point $(\phi_c,T_c)$
is located at very low densities and slightly below $T_c$ we identify phase
coexistence between two low-density phases. Dense domains are observed only
when the height by which the bonds deform the membranes, $h_0$, is much larger
than their thermal roughness, $\Delta$, which occurs at very low temperatures
$T\ll T_c$. We conclude that the elasticity-mediated interactions are weak and
cannot be regarded as responsible for the formation of dense adhesion domains.
The weakness of the elasticity-mediated effect and its relevance to dilute
systems only can be attributed to the fact that the membrane's elastic energy
saturates in the semi-dilute regime, when the typical spacing between the bonds
$r\gtrsim \xi$, i.e., for $x\lesssim 1$. Therefore, at higher densities, only
the mixing entropy of the bonds (which favors uniform distributions) is
thermodynamically relevant. We discuss the implications of our results to the
question of immunological synapse formation, and demonstrate the
elasticity-mediated interactions may be involved in the aggregation of these
semi-dilute membrane domains.

  Mathematique",,,,"math.AP math.CO math.PR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We introduce a new lattice growth model, which we call boundary sandpile. The
model amounts to potential-theoretic redistribution of a given initial mass on
$\mathbb{Z}^d$ ($d\geq 2$) onto the boundary of an (a priori) unknown domain.
The latter evolves through sandpile dynamics, and has the property that the
mass on the boundary is forced to stay below a prescribed threshold. Since
finding the domain is part of the problem, the redistribution process is a
discrete model of a free boundary problem, whose continuum limit is yet to be
understood.
  We prove general results concerning our model. These include canonical
representation of the model in terms of the smallest super-solution among a
certain class of functions, uniform Lipschitz regularity of the scaled odometer
function, and hence the convergence of a subsequence of the odometer and the
visited sites, discrete symmetry properties, as well as directional
monotonicity of the odometer function. The latter (in part) implies the
Lipschitz regularity of the free boundary of the sandpile.
  As a direct application of some of the methods developed in this paper,
combined with earlier results on classical Abelian sandpile, we show that the
boundary of the scaling limit of Abelian sandpile is locally a Lipschitz graph.

Milky Way, claimed to be embedded in a huge dark matter halo, and the only
among the Milky Way satellites hosting five globular clusters. Interestingly,
their estimated masses, ages and positions seem hardly compatible with the
presence of a significant dark matter component, as expected in the $\Lambda$
CDM scheme. Indeed, if Fornax would have a CDM halo with a standard density
profile, all its globular clusters should have sunk to the galactic centre many
Gyr ago due to dynamical friction. Due to this, some authors proposed that the
most massive clusters may have formed out of Fornax and later tidally captured.
In this paper we investigate the past evolution of the Fornax GC system by
using both a recently developed, semi-analytical treatment of dynamical
friction and direct $N$-body simulations of the orbital evolution of the
globular clusters within Fornax and of Fornax galaxy around the Milky Way. Our
results suggest that an ""in-situ"" origin for all the clusters is likely if
their observed positions are close to their spatial ones and their orbits are
almost circular. Moreover, the Milky Way seems to accelerate the GC decay
reducing the decay time of $15\%$. Nevertheless, our results indicate that the
GCs survival probability exceeds $50\%$, even in the case of cuspy density
profiles. We conclude that more detailed data are required to shed light on the
Fornax dark matter content, to distinguish between a cuspy or a cored profile.

We show that the square of many-electron operator $\mathcal{K}_+$, defined as a
sum of individual single-electron time-reversal (TR) operators, is a linear
Hermitian operator which commutes with the Dirac-Coulomb Hamiltonian in a
finite Fock subspace. In contrast to the square of a standard unitary
many-electron TR operator $\mathcal{K}$, the $\mathcal{K}^2_+$ has a rich
eigenspectrum having potential to substitute spin symmetry in the relativistic

through an exponential mapping, in the same way as spin operators are mapped to
the spin rotational group. Consequently, we call $\mathcal{K}_+$ the generator
of the many-electron TR symmetry. By diagonalizing the operator
$\mathcal{K}^2_+$ in the basis of Kramers-restricted Slater determinants, we
introduce the relativistic variant of configuration state functions (CSF),

suggests that the corrugation of the termination shock, at the onset of
non-linearity, may lead towards the desired phenomenology. Non-linear
corrugation of the termination shock would convert a fraction of order unity of
the incoming ordered magnetic field into downstream turbulence, slowing down
the flow to sub-relativistic velocities. The dissipation of turbulence would
further preheat the pair population on short length scales, close to
equipartition with the magnetic field, thereby reducing the initial high
magnetization to values of order unity. Furthermore, it is speculated that the
turbulence generated by the corrugation pattern may sustain a relativistic
Fermi process, accelerating particles close to the radiation reaction limit, as
observed in the Crab nebula. The required corrugation could be induced by the
fast magnetosonic modes of downstream nebular turbulence; but it could also be
produced by upstream turbulence, either carried by the wind or seeded in the
precursor by the accelerated particles themselves.

of the given data. When pairwise similarities are captured by a kernel, the
determinants of submatrices provide a measure of diversity or independence of
items within a subset. Matroid theory gives another notion of independence,
thus giving rise to optimization and sampling questions about Determinantal
Point Processes (DPPs) under matroid constraints. Partition constraints, as a
special case, arise naturally when incorporating additional labeling or
clustering information, besides the kernel, in DPPs. Finding the maximum
determinant submatrix under matroid constraints on its row/column indices has
been previously studied. However, the corresponding question of sampling from
DPPs under matroid constraints has been unresolved, beyond the simple
cardinality constrained k-DPPs. We give the first polynomial time algorithm to
sample exactly from DPPs under partition constraints, for any constant number
of partitions. We complement this by a complexity theoretic barrier that rules
out such a result under general matroid constraints. Our experiments indicate
that partition-constrained DPPs offer more flexibility and more diversity than
k-DPPs and their naive extensions, while being reasonably efficient in running
time. We also show that a simple greedy initialization followed by local search
gives improved approximation guarantees for the problem of MAP inference from
k- DPPs on well-conditioned kernels. Our experiments show that this improvement
is significant for larger values of k, supporting our theoretical result.

the spectrum of the elementary areas, functions of the tetrad bilinears. The

X-ray sources that can be observed by the presently operating powerful X-ray
telescopes. In this review I briefly address recent advances in our
understanding of stellar winds obtained from X-ray observations. The winds of
OB dwarfs with subtypes later than O9V may be predominantly in a hot phase, and
X-ray observations offer the best window for their studies. The X-ray
properties of OB supergiants are largely determined by the effects of radiative
transfer in their clumped stellar winds. The recently suggested method to
directly measure mass-loss rates of O stars by fitting the shapes of X-ray
emission lines is considered but its validity cannot be confirmed. To obtain
robust quantitative information on stellar wind parameters from X-ray
spectroscopy, a multiwavelength analysis by means of stellar atmosphere models
is required. Independent groups are now performing such analyses with
encouraging results. Joint analyses of optical, UV, and X-ray spectra of OB
supergiants yield consistent mass-loss rates. Depending on the adopted clumping
parameters, the empirically derived mass-loss rates are comparable (within a
factor of a few) to those predicted by standard recipes (Vink et al. 2001). All
sufficiently studied O stars display variable X-ray emission that might be
related to corotating interaction regions in their winds. In the latest stages
of stellar evolution, single red supergiants and luminous blue variable stars
do not emit observable amounts of X-rays. On the other hand, nearly all types
of Wolf-Rayet (WR) stars are X-ray sources. X-ray spectroscopy allows a
sensitive probe of WR wind abundances and opacities.

Hydrodynamic simulations of such colliding and accreting winds produce a
complex density and temperature structure of cold wind material shocking with
the ambient medium, creating a large reservoir of hot, X-ray-emitting gas. This
work aims to confront the 3 Ms of Chandra X-ray Visionary Program observations
of this diffuse emission by computing the X-ray emission from these
hydrodynamic simulations of the colliding WR winds, amid exploring a variety of
SMBH feedback mechanisms. The major success of the model is that it reproduces
the spectral shape from the 2-5 arcsec ring around the SMBH, where most of the
stellar wind material that is ultimately captured by Sgr A* is shock-heated and
thermalised. This naturally explains that the hot gas comes from colliding WR
winds, and that the wind speeds of these stars are, in general, well
constrained. The flux level of these spectra, as well as 12 $\times$
12-arcsec$^2$ images of 4-9 keV, shows that the X-ray flux is tied to the SMBH
feedback strength; stronger feedback clears out more hot gas, thereby
decreasing the thermal X-ray emission. The model in which Sgr A* produced an
intermediate-strength outflow during the last few centuries best matches the
observations to within about 10 per cent, showing that SMBH feedback is
required to interpret the X-ray emission in this region.

to delegate universal quantum computing to a remote quantum server in such a
way that the client's privacy is protected and the honesty of the server is
verified. In existing protocols, the client has to send single-qubit states to
the server. These states might be decohered by the channel noise. Furthermore,
the client hides some ""trap"" qubits in the server's register so that the client
can detect the server's deviation. In reality, however, these trap qubits are
disturbed by imperfect operations by the server, which reduces the probability
that the client accepts the honest server. To solve these problems, we propose
a new gadget that allows the client to remotely prepare encoded logical
single-qubit states in the server's place. Importantly, in our fault-tolerant
verifiable blind quantum computing protocol, the client needs only the ability
of physical single-qubit measurements in $X$ and $Z$ bases.

to a rich body of literature. At the center of this literature lies the
question of whether there exist fair mechanisms despite strategic behavior of
the agents. A fundamental objective function used for measuring fair outcomes
is the Nash social welfare, defined as the geometric mean of the agent
utilities. This objective function is maximized by widely known solution
concepts such as Nash bargaining and the competitive equilibrium with equal
incomes. In this work we focus on the question of (approximately) implementing
the Nash social welfare. The starting point of our analysis is the Fisher
market, a fundamental model of an economy, whose benchmark is precisely the
(weighted) Nash social welfare. We begin by studying two extreme classes of
valuations functions, namely perfect substitutes and perfect complements, and
find that for perfect substitutes, the Fisher market mechanism has a constant
approximation: at most 2 and at least e1e. However, for perfect complements,
the Fisher market does not work well, its bound degrading linearly with the
number of players.
  Strikingly, the Trading Post mechanism---an indirect market mechanism also
known as the Shapley-Shubik game---has significantly better performance than
the Fisher market on its own benchmark. Not only does Trading Post achieve an
approximation of 2 for perfect substitutes, but this bound holds for all
concave utilities and becomes arbitrarily close to optimal for Leontief
utilities (perfect complements), where it reaches $(1+\epsilon)$ for every
$\epsilon > 0$. Moreover, all the Nash equilibria of the Trading Post mechanism
are pure for all concave utilities and satisfy an important notion of fairness
known as proportionality.

Taking into account the practical constraint of imperfect channel estimation,
we study the achievable sum spectral efficiency of the amplify-and-forward (AF)

maximum ratio processing. We derive an exact closed-form expression for the sum
spectral efficiency of the AF protocol and a large-scale approximation for the

$M$, becomes sufficiently large. In addition, we study how the transmit power
scales with $M$ to maintain a desired quality-of-service. In particular, our
results show that by using a large number of relay antennas, the transmit
powers of the user, relay, and pilot symbol can be scaled down proportionally
to $1/M^\alpha$, $1/M^\beta$, and $1/M^\gamma$ for certain $\alpha$, $\beta$,

fundamental tradeoff between the transmit powers of the user/relay and pilot

order of magnitude increase in the detector sensitivity at $\sim0.1-1$ PeV will
enable a detection (as point sources) of the few brightest objects. Such an
increase, which may be provided by next-generation detectors like IceCube-Gen2

gravitational telescopes that nature provides. Our survey was based on
multi-epoch $J$-band observations with the HAWK-I instrument on VLT, with
supporting optical data from the Nordic Optical Telescope. Our search resulted
in the discovery of five high-redshift, $0.671<z<1.703$, photometrically
classified core-collapse supernovae with magnifications in the range $\Delta m$
= $-0.31$ to $-1.58$ mag, as calculated from lensing models in the literature.
Thanks to the power of the lensing cluster, the survey had the sensitivity to
detect supernovae up to very high-redshifts, $z$$\sim$$3$, albeit for a limited
region of space. We present a study of the core-collapse supernova rates for
$0.4\leq z< 2.9$, and find good agreement with both previous estimates, and the
predictions from the star formation history. During our survey, we also
discovered 2 type Ia supernovae in A1689 cluster members, which allowed us to
determine the cluster Ia rate to be $0.14^{+0.19}_{-0.09}\pm0.01$
$\rm{SNuB}$$\,h^2$ (SNuB$\equiv 10^{-12} \,\rm{SNe} \, L^{-1}_{\odot,B}
yr^{-1}$). The cluster rate normalized by the stellar mass is
$0.10^{+0.13}_{-0.06}\pm0.02$ in $\rm SNuM$$\,h^2$ (SNuM$\equiv 10^{-12}
\,\rm{SNe} \, M^{-1}_{\odot} yr^{-1}$). Furthermore, we explore the optimal
future survey for improving the core-collapse supernova rate measurements at
$z\gtrsim2$ using gravitational telescopes, as well as for the detections with
multiply lensed images, and find that the planned WFIRST space mission has
excellent prospects. Massive clusters can be used as gravitational telescopes
to significantly expand the survey range of supernova searches, with important
implications for the study of the high-$z$ transient universe.

simple paradigm of a two dimensional structure, where anomalous diffusion can
be realized in the framework of Markov processes. However, the intrinsic
properties of the structure can destroy this Markovian transport. These effects
can be described by the memory and spatial kernels. In particular, the fractal
structure of the fingers, which is controlled by the spatial kernel in both the
real and the Fourier spaces, leads to the L\'evy processes (L\'evy flights) and
superdiffusion. This generalization of the fractional diffusion is described by
the Riesz space fractional derivative. In the framework of this generalized
fractal comb model, L\'evy processes are considered, and exact solutions for
the probability distribution functions are obtained in terms of the Fox
$H$-function for a variety of the memory kernels, and the rate of the
superdiffusive spreading is studied by calculating the fractional moments. For
a special form of the memory kernels, we also observed a competition between
long rests and long jumps. Finally, we considered the fractional structure of
the fingers controlled by a Weierstrass function, which leads to the power-law
kernel in the Fourier space. It is a special case, when the second moment
exists for superdiffusion in this competition between long rests and long
jumps.

manuscripts is only an attempt. Our approach is to study the finiteness variety
$V_f \subset Y_0$ of $f$, the set of points of $Y_0$ over which $f$ fails to be
proper. We study a general component $V \subset V_f$ of this set by introducing
a suitable representation of $X_0$ which we call the $u-\gamma$ representation.
This view of $X_0$ has the advantage that it allows us to explicitly write down
the Jacobian matrix of $f$. We then turn our attention to the condition that
$|J(f)| = 1$, which we interpret as a partial differential equation in one
unknown function. We study the characteristics of this equation and prove that
the dynamics of this is strongly related to the ramification $K$ above $V$. We
then study the action of a certain cyclic Galois group induced by the
$u-\gamma$ action on these differential equations and prove that the growth of
the functions are bounded. Alternatively we prove the same result via a vector
field argument where we deduce that if $K > 0$ then the function $u^{-K}$ is in
fact an analytic function around $v \in V \subset Y_0$. This leads to $K = 1$
and as $\pi_1(Y_0 - S) \simeq \pi_1(Y_0)$ if $S$ is of codimension at least
two, the Jacobian conjecture follows immediately.

analyzed by a spin-crossover model of a single ion with interion interactions.
On the other hand, the chemical pressure dependence of the experimentally
obtained magnetization change during the phase transition disagrees with the
single ion model when approaching low temperatures. The significant $y$
dependence of the magnetization change at low temperatures may arise from the
itinerant magnetism of Co$^{3+}$ in the paramagnetic metallic phase, where the

double-exchange interaction. The observed $B$-$T$ phase diagrams of

superconductivity of both I and II types is analysed, and possible presence of

state of liquids on substrates with nanoscale corrugation. A bulk free-energy
functional of third order in local density is combined with a square-gradient
term, describing the liquid-vapor interface. The bulk free energy is
parameterized to reproduce the liquid density and the compressibility of water.
The square-gradient term is adjusted to model the width of the water-vapor
interface. The substrate is modeled by an external potential, based upon
Lennard-Jones interactions. The three-dimensional calculation focuses on
substrates patterned with nanostripes and square-shaped nanopillars. Using both
the force-balance relation and density-functional theory, we locate the
Cassie-to-Wenzel transition as a function of the corrugation parameters. We
demonstrate that the force-balance relation gives a qualitatively reasonable
description of the transition even on the nanoscale. The force balance utilizes
an effective contact angle between the fluid and the vertical wall of the
corrugation to parameterize the impalement pressure. This effective angle is
found to have values smaller than the Young contact angle. This observation
corresponds to an impalement pressure that is smaller than the value predicted
by macroscopic theory. Therefore, this effective angle embodies effects
specific to nanoscopically corrugated surfaces, including the finite range of
the liquid-solid potential (which has both repulsive and attractive parts),
line tension, and the finite interface thickness. Consistently with this
picture, both patterns (stripes and pillars) yield the same effective contact
angles for large periods of corrugation.

significant deformation of the substrate. This deformation is driven by a
combination of capillary forces at the contact line and the fluid pressure at

traction stress induced by the substrate deformation. Young's Law, which
predicts the equilibrium contact angle of the droplet, also indicates an a
priori radial force balance for rigid substrates, but not necessarily for soft
substrates which deform under loading. It remains an open question whether the
contact line transmits a non-zero radial force to the substrate surface in
addition to the conventional vertical force. We present an analytic Fourier
transform solution technique that includes general interfacial energy
conditions which govern the contact angle of a 2D droplet. This includes
evaluating the effect of gravity on the droplet shape in order to determine the
correct fluid pressure at the substrate surface for larger droplets.
Importantly, we find that in order to avoid a strain singularity at the contact
line under a nonzero radial contact line force, it is necessary to include a
previously-neglected radial traction boundary condition. To quantify the
effects of the contact line and identify key quantities that will be

because traditional pattern-matching techniques can no longer be applied to its
messages. However, TLS also introduces a complex set of observable data
features that allow many inferences to be made about both the client and the
server. We show that these features can be used to detect and understand
malware communication, while at the same time preserving the privacy of benign
uses of encryption. These data features also allow for accurate malware family
attribution of network communication, even when restricted to a single,
encrypted flow.
  To demonstrate this, we performed a detailed study of how TLS is used by
malware and enterprise applications. We provide a general analysis on millions
of TLS encrypted flows, and a targeted study on 18 malware families composed of
thousands of unique malware samples and ten-of-thousands of malicious TLS
flows. Importantly, we identify and accommodate the bias introduced by the use
of a malware sandbox. The performance of a malware classifier is correlated
with a malware family's use of TLS, i.e., malware families that actively evolve
their use of cryptography are more difficult to classify.
  We conclude that malware's usage of TLS is distinct from benign usage in an
enterprise setting, and that these differences can be effectively used in rules
and machine learning classifiers.

spin relaxation at long times. If the random walk is restricted to a small
area, it leads to the quenching of carrier spin polarization at a non-zero
value at long times. If the random walk is unrestricted, the carrier spin
polarization acquires a long-time tail, decaying as $ 1/\sqrt{t}$. Based on the

black-box (instrumentalist) approach to generalized probabilistic theories;
therefore, it does not assume a priori any particular underlying mechanism.
From that point of view our experimental results do indeed place meaningful
bounds on possible effects of ""post-quantum theories"", including quaternionic
quantum mechanics. In his article, Adler compares our experiment to
non-relativistic and M\""oller formal scattering theory within quaternionic
quantum mechanics. With a particular set of assumptions, he finds that
quaternionic effects would likely not manifest themselves in general. Although
these assumptions are justified in the non-relativistic case, a proper
calculation for relativistic particles is still missing. Here, we provide a
concrete relativistic example of Klein-Gordon scattering wherein the
quaternionic effects persist. We note that when the Klein-Gordon equation is
formulated using a Hamiltonian formalism it displays a so-called ""indefinite
metric"", a characteristic feature of relativistic quantum wave equations. In
Adler's example this is directly forbidden by his assumptions, and therefore
our present example is not in contradiction to his work. In complex quantum
mechanics this problem of an indefinite metric is solved in second
quantization. Unfortunately, there is no known algorithm for canonical field
quantization in quaternionic quantum mechanics.

insufficiencies of data, appearances of noise, and inconsistencies of
observations. Under sparse views, conventional filtered back-projection type
reconstruction methods fails to provide CT images with satisfying quality.
Moreover, direct image decomposition is unstable and meet with noise boost even
with full views dataset. This paper proposes an iterative image reconstruction
algorithm and a practical image domain decomposition method for DECT. On one
hand, the reconstruction algorithm is formulated as an optimization problem,
which containing total variation regularization term and data fidelity term.
The alternating direction method is utilized to design the corresponding
algorithm which shows faster convergence speed compared with the existing ones.
On the other hand, the image domain decomposition applies the penalized least
square (PLS) estimation on decomposing the material mappings. The PLS includes
linear combination term and the regularization term which enforces the
smoothness on estimation images. The authors implement and evaluate the
proposed joint method on real DECT projections and compare the method with
typical and state-of-the-art reconstruction and decomposition methods. The
experiments on dataset of an anthropomorphic head phantom show that our methods
have advantages on noise suppression and edge reservation, without blurring the

dynamics of an optical field in a cavity containing a moving membrane
(""membrane-in-the-middle"" set-up). Our approach is based on the Maxwell wave
equation, and complements previous studies based on an effective Hamiltonian.
The analysis shows that for slowly moving and weakly reflective membranes the
dynamics can be approximated by unitary, first-order-in-time evolution given by
an effective Schr\""{o}dinger-like equation with a Hamiltonian that does not
depend on the membrane speed. This approximate theory is the one typically
adopted in cavity optomechanics and we develop a criterion for its validity.
However, in more general situations the full second-order wave equation
predicts light dynamics which do not conserve energy, giving rise to parametric
amplification (or reduction) that is forbidden under first order dynamics and
can be considered to be the classical counterpart of the dynamical Casimir
effect. The case of a membrane moving at constant velocity can be mapped onto
the Landau-Zener problem but with additional terms responsible for field
amplification. Furthermore, the nature of the adiabatic regime is rather
different from the ordinary Schr\""odinger case, since mode amplitudes need not
be constant even when there are no transitions between them. The Landau-Zener
problem for a field is therefore richer than in the standard single-particle
case. We use the work-energy theorem applied to the radiation pressure on the
membrane as a self-consistency check for our solutions of the wave equation and
as a tool to gain an intuitive understanding of energy pumped into/out of the

nodes, and all ports at any node of degree $d$ are arbitrarily numbered
$0,\dots, d-1$. A mobile agent has to visit all nodes and stop. The exploration
time is the number of edge traversals. We consider the problem of how much
knowledge the agent has to have a priori, in order to explore the graph in a
given time, using a deterministic algorithm. This a priori information (advice)
is provided to the agent by an oracle, in the form of a binary string, whose
length is called the size of advice. We consider two types of oracles. The
instance oracle knows the entire instance of the exploration problem, i.e., the
port-numbered map of the graph and the starting node of the agent in this map.
The map oracle knows the port-numbered map of the graph but does not know the
starting node of the agent.
  We first consider exploration in polynomial time, and determine the exact
minimum size of advice to achieve it. This size is $\log\log\log n -\Theta(1)$,
for both types of oracles.
  When advice is large, there are two natural time thresholds: $\Theta(n^2)$
for a map oracle, and $\Theta(n)$ for an instance oracle, that can be achieved
with sufficiently large advice. We show that, with a map oracle, time
$\Theta(n^2)$ cannot be improved in general, regardless of the size of advice.
We also show that the smallest size of advice to achieve this time is larger
than $n^\delta$, for any $\delta <1/3$.
  For an instance oracle, advice of size $O(n\log n)$ is enough to achieve time
$O(n)$. We show that, with any advice of size $o(n\log n)$, the time of
exploration must be at least $n^\epsilon$, for any $\epsilon <2$, and with any
advice of size $O(n)$, the time must be $\Omega(n^2)$.

\cdot x_{n}+(1-\alpha )\cdot x_{n-1})]\, .$$ The map $G_\alpha$ for
$\alpha\in(0,3/4]$ was studied in \cite{MwM1}. In this paper we prove that for
$\alpha\in(3/4,1)$ the map $G_\alpha$ admits a singular Sinai-Ruelle-Bowen
measure. We do this by applying Rychlik's results for the Lozi map. However,
unlike the Lozi map, the maps $G_\alpha$ are not invertible which creates
complications that we are able to overcome.

$m$-jets generated by functions $F\in L^{m+1}_p(R^n)$. Our trace criterion is
expressed in terms of variations of corresponding Taylor remainders of $m$-jets
evaluated on a certain family of ""well separated"" two point subsets of $E$. For
$p=\infty$ this result coincides with the classical Whitney-Glaeser extension
theorem for $m$-jets.
  Our approach is based on a representation of the Sobolev space
$L^{m+1}_p(R^n)$, $p>n$, as a union of $C^{m,(d)}(R^n)$-spaces where $d$
belongs to a family of metrics on $R^n$ with certain ""nice"" properties. Here
$C^{m,(d)}(R^n)$ is the space of $C^m$-functions on $R^n$ whose partial

  This enables us to show that, for every non-negative integer $m$ and every

provides an almost optimal extension of $m$-jets generated by
$L^{m+1}_p$-functions.

semi-analytically using the nonlinear, nonstationary reduced-gravity

by linear distributions of their radial velocity and arbitrary structures of
their section and azimuthal velocity can be described exactly by a set of
nonstationary, nonlinear coupled ordinary differential equations. The
first-order problem (i.e., that describing vortices characterized by a linear
azimuthal velocity field and a quadratic section) consists of a system of 4
differential equations, and each further order introduces in the system three
additional ordinary differential equations and two algebraic equations. In
order to illustrate the behavior of the nonstationary decaying vortices, the
system's solution for the first-order and for the second-order problem is then
obtained numerically using a Runge-Kutta method. The solutions demonstrate that
inertial oscillations and an exponential attenuation dominate the vortex
dynamics: Expansions and shallowings, contractions and deepenings alternate
during an exact inertial period while the vortex decays. The dependence of the
vortex dissipation rate on its initial radius is found to be non-monotonic: It
is higher for small and large radii. Our analysis adds realism to previous
theoretical investigations on mesoscale vortices, represents an ideal tool for
testing the accuracy of numerical models in simulating nonlinear, nonstationary
frictional frontal phenomena in a rotating ocean, and paves the way to further
extensions of (semi-) analytical solutions of hydrodynamical geophysical

in these tests, following indications of possible spacetime variations at the
few parts per million level. Here we make use of the latest astrophysical
measurements, combined with background cosmological observations, to obtain
improved constraints on Bekenstein-type models for the evolution of both
couplings. These are arguably the simplest models allowing for $\alpha$ and
$\mu$ variations, and are characterized by a single free dimensionless
parameter, $\zeta$, describing the coupling of the underlying dynamical degree
of freedom to the electromagnetic sector. In the former case we find that this
parameter is constrained to be $|\zeta_\alpha|<4.8\times10^{-6}$ (improving
previous constraints by a factor of 6), while in the latter (which we
quantitatively compare to astrophysical measurements for the first time) we
find $\zeta_\mu=(2.7\pm3.1)\times10^{-7}$; both of these are at the $99.7\%$
confidence level. For $\zeta_\alpha$ this constraint is about 20 times stronger
than the one obtained from local Weak Equivalence Principle tests, while for
$\zeta_\mu$ it is about 2 orders of magnitude weaker. We also discuss the
improvements on these constraints to be expected from the forthcoming ESPRESSO

optimization with covariance-based Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and a
genetic optimization, for 10,000 randomly defined samples, achieving a final
maximum classification success of 91% against the original 70% success ratio

limit, describe chaotic inflation with a stabilizer field. We first analyze
type IIA setups where the inflationary potential arises from a D6-brane
wrapping an internal three-cycle, and where the stabilizer field is either an
open-string or bulk K\""ahler modulus. We find that after integrating out the
relevant closed-string moduli consistently, tachyonic directions arise during
inflation which cannot be lifted. This is ultimately due to the shift
symmetries of the type IIA K\""ahler potential at large compactification volume.
This motivates us to search for stabilizer candidates in the complex structure
sector of type IIB orientifolds, since these fields couple to D7-brane Wilson
lines and their shift symmetries are generically broken away from the large
complex structure limit. However, we find that in these setups the challenge is
to obtain the necessary hierarchy between the inflationary and Kaluza-Klein
scales.

happens for results like Rice Theorem (which is false for primitive recursive

Pi_2-complete (omit superscripts from now on). We compare the degree of

analyse a network function as a complex system. We propose functional
topologies to visualise the relationships between system entities and enable
the systematic study of interactions between them. We also define a complexity
metric $C_F$ (functional complexity) which quantifies the variety of structural
patterns and roles of nodes in the topology. This complexity metric provides a
wholly new approach to study the operation of telecommunication networks. We
study the relationship between $C_F$ and different graph structures by
analysing graph theory metrics in order to recognize complex organisations.
$C_F$ is equal to zero for both a full mesh topology and a disconnected
topology. We show that complexity is very high for a dense structure that shows
high integration (shorter average path length and high average clustering
coefficient). We make a connection between functional complexity, robustness
and response to changes that may appear in the system configuration. We also
make a connection between the implementation and the outcome of a network
function which correlates the characteristics of the outcome with the complex
relationships that underpin the functional structure.

We identify two cases of damping, one related to damping of cosmic rays
streaming instability, the other related to damping of Alfven waves emitted by
a macroscopic wave source, e.g. stellar atmosphere. The physical difference
between the two cases is that in the former case the generated waves are
emitted in respect to the local direction of magnetic field, in the latter in
respect to the mean field. The scaling of damping is different in the two
cases. We the regimes of turbulence ranging from subAlfvenic to superAlfvenic
we obtain analytical expressions for the damping rates and define the ranges of
applicability of these expressions. Describing the damping of the streaming
instability, we find that for subAlfvenic turbulence the range of cosmic ray
energies influenced by weak turbulence is unproportionally large compared to
the range of scales that the weak turbulence is present. On the contrary, the
range of cosmic ray energies affected by strong Alfvenic turbulence is rather
limited. A number of astrophysical applications of the process ranging from
launching of stellar and galactic winds to propagation of cosmic rays in
galaxies and clusters of galaxies is considered. In particular, we discuss how
to reconcile the process of turbulent damping with the observed isotropy of the
Milky Way cosmic rays.

a source of the powerful wind and jets. The origin of W50 is wrapped in the
interplay of the wind, supernova remnant and jets. The evolution of the jets on
the scales of the nebula is a Rosetta stone for its origin. To disentangle the
roles of these components, we study physical conditions of the jets propagation
inside W50, and determine deceleration of the jets. The morphology and
parameters of the interior of W50 are analyzed using the available observations
of the eastern X-ray lobe, which traces the jet. In order to estimate
deceleration of this jet, we devised a simplistic model of the viscous
interaction, via turbulence, of a jet with the ambient medium, which would fit
mass entrainment from the ambient medium into the jets of the radio galaxy
3C31, the well studied case of continuously decelerating jets. X-ray
observations suggest that the eastern jet persists through W50 as hollow one,
and is recollimated to the opening $\sim 30^\circ$. From the thermal emission
of the eastern X-ray lobe, we determine a pressure of $P \sim 3\cdot 10^{-11}$
erg/cm$^3$ inside W50. In the frame of a theory of the dynamics of radiative
supernova remnants and stellar wind bubbles, this pressure in combination with
other known parameters restricts W50's origin to a supernova happened $\sim
100\,000$ yr ago. Also, this pressure in our entrainment model gives a
deceleration of the jet by $\sim 60\%$ in the bounds of W50's spherical
component, of radius $\sim 40$ pc. In this case, the age of the jet should be
$\ll 27\,000$ yr so as to satisfy the sphericity of W50. The entrainment model
comes to the viscous stress in a jet of a form $\sigma = \alpha P$, where the
viscosity parameter $\alpha$ is predefined by the model.

  Yuc., M\'exico. Accepted",,,,"physics.gen-ph hep-th","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  I present explicit examples of generalizations in relativistic quantum
mechanics. First of all, I discuss the generalized spin-1/2 equations for
neutrinos. They have been obtained by means of the Gersten-Sakurai method for
derivations of arbitrary-spin relativistic equations. Possible physical
consequences are discussed. Next, it is easy to check that both Dirac algebraic
equation $Det (\hat p - m) =0$ and $Det (\hat p + m) =0$ for $u-$ and $v-$
4-spinors have solutions with $p_0= \pm E_p =\pm \sqrt{{\bf p}^2 +m^2}$. The
same is true for higher-spin equations. Meanwhile, every book considers the
equality $p_0=E_p$ for both $u-$ and $v-$ spinors of the $(1/2,0)\oplus
(0,1/2))$ representation only, thus applying the Dirac-Feynman-Stueckelberg
procedure for elimination of the negative-energy solutions. The recent work by
Ziino (and, independently, the articles of several others) show that the Fock
space can be doubled. We re-consider this possibility on the quantum field
level for $S=1/2$ particles. The third example is: we postulate the
non-commutativity of 4-momenta, and we derive the mass splitting in the Dirac
equation. Some applications are discussed.

inhomogeneities (e.g., galaxies and their groups and clusters) and two sets of
perfect fluids with linear and nonlinear equations of state, respectively. The
background spacetime geometry is defined by the FLRW metric. In the weak
gravitational field limit, we develop the first-order scalar and vector
cosmological perturbation theory. Our approach works at all cosmological scales
(i.e. sub-horizon and super-horizon ones) and incorporates linear and nonlinear
effects with respect to energy density fluctuations. We demonstrate that the
scalar perturbation (i.e. the gravitational potential) as well as the vector
perturbation can be split into individual contributions from each matter
source. Each of these contributions satisfies its own equation. The
velocity-independent parts of the individual gravitational potentials are
characterized by a finite time-dependent Yukawa interaction range being the
same for each individual contribution. We also obtain the exact form of the
gravitational potential and vector perturbation related to the discrete matter
sources. The self-consistency of our approach is thoroughly checked. The
derived equations can form the theoretical basis for numerical simulations for
a wide class of cosmological models.

costs, and significant morbidity and mortality for patients. Pathological falls
are usually a result of a compromised motor system, and/or cognition. Very
little research has been conducted on predicting falls based on this premise.
  Aims: To demonstrate that cognitive and motor tests can be used to create a
robust predictive tool for falls.
  Methods: Three tests of attention and executive function (Stroop, Trail
Making, and Semantic Fluency), a measure of physical function (Walk-12), a
series of questions (concerning recent falls, surgery and physical function)
and demographic information were collected from a cohort of 323 patients at a
tertiary neurological center. The principal outcome was a fall during the
in-patient stay (n = 54). Data-driven, predictive modelling was employed to
identify the statistical modelling strategies which are most accurate in
predicting falls, and which yield the most parsimonious models of clinical
relevance.
  Results: The Trail test was identified as the best predictor of falls.
Moreover, addition of any others variables, to the results of the Trail test
did not improve the prediction (Wilcoxon signed-rank p < .001). The best
statistical strategy for predicting falls was the random forest (Wilcoxon
signed-rank p < .001), based solely on results of the Trail test. Tuning of the
model results in the following optimized values: 68% (+- 7.7) sensitivity, 90%
(+- 2.3) specificity, with a positive predictive value of 60%, when the
relevant data is available.
  Conclusion: Predictive modelling has identified a simple yet powerful machine
learning prediction strategy based on a single clinical test, the Trail test.
Predictive evaluation shows this strategy to be robust, suggesting predictive
modelling and machine learning as the standard for future predictive tools.
