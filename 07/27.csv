two superconductors with intrinsic exchange fields are studied. We find that
for a parallel configuration of the exchange fields in the superconductors the
discrete spectrum consists of two pairs of spin-split states. The Josephson
current in this case is mainly carried by bound states. In contrast, for the
antiparallel configuration we find that there is no spin-splitting of the bound
states and that for phase differences smaller than certain critical value there
are no bound states at all. Hence the supercurrent is only carried by states in
the continuous part of the spectrum. Our predictions can be tested by
performing a tunneling spectroscopy of a weak link between two spin-split
superconductors.

Those applications require a substantial tolerance to both, ionizing and
non-ionizing radiation. To allow for a focused optimization of the radiation
tolerance, prototypes are tested by irradiating the devices either with purely
ionizing radiation (e.g. soft X-rays) or the most pure sources of non-ionizing

typically assumed that the impact of the parasitic $\gamma$-rays found in the

cause non-negligible radiation damage. Based on the results we propose a

Here, we theoretically show that a quantum dot $\varphi_{0}$ Josephson junction

Microscopically, we find that the phase shift in a junction of $s-$wave
superconductors is due to the spin-orbit induced mixing of singly occupied
states on the qantum dot, while for a topological superconductor junction it is
due to singlet-triplet mixing. Because of this important difference, when the
spin-orbit vector of the quantum dot and the external Zeeman field are
orthogonal, the $s$-wave superconductors form a $\pi$ Josephson junction while
the topological superconductors have a finite offset $\varphi_{0}$ by which
topological superconductivity can be distinguished from conventional
superconductivity. Our prediction can be immediately tested in nanowire systems
currently used for Majorana fermion experiments and thus offers a new and
realistic approach for detecting topological bound states.

conformational search for the native, mainly ruled by the hydrophobic effect;
and, the final adjustment stage, which eventually gives stability to the
native. Our main tool of investigation is a 3D lattice model provided with a
ten-letter alphabet, the stereochemical model. This model was conceived for
Monte Carlo (MC) simulations when one keeps in mind the kinetic behavior of
protein-like chains in solution. In order to characterize the folding
characteristic time ({\tau}) by two distinct sampling methods, first we present
two sets of 10^{3} MC simulations for a fast protein-like sequence. For these
sets of folding times, {\tau} and {\tau}_{q} were obtained with the application
of the standard Metropolis algorithm (MA), and a modified algorithm (M_{q}A).
The results for {\tau}_{q}reveal two things: i) the hydrophobic chain-solvent
interactions plus a set of inter-residues steric constraints are enough to
emulate the first stage of the process: for each one of the 10^{3} MC performed
simulations, the native is always found without exception, ii) the ratio
{\tau}_{q}/{\tau}~1/3 suggests that the effect of local thermal fluctuations,
encompassed by the Tsallis weight, provides an innate efficiency to the chain
escapes from energetic and steric traps. ...

kind of models assume an equation of state for vacuum given by $\,\overline
P_\Lambda=-\,\overline\rho_\Lambda$, relating their background pressure
$\,\overline P_\Lambda$ and mean energy density
$\,\overline\rho_\Lambda\equiv\Lambda/8\pi G$. This equation of state requires
that the dynamic for vacuum is due to the energy exchange with the material
species. Most of the approaches to background level consider only the energy
exchange between vacuum and the transient dominant material component of the
universe. We extend such models assuming the running vacuum as the sum of
independent contributions $\,\overline\rho_{\Lambda}
=\sum_i\,\overline\rho_{\Lambda i}$, associated with (and interacting with)
each of the $i$ material species. We derive the linear scalar perturbations for
two running scenarios, modeling its cosmic evolution and identifying their
different imprints on the cosmic microwave background anisotropies and the
matter power spectrum. In the $\Lambda(H^2)$ scenario the running vacuum are
coupled with all the material species in the universe, whereas the $\Lambda(R)$
description only leads to coupling between vacuum and the non-relativistic
matter components; which produces different imprints of the two models on the
matter power spectrum. A comparison with the Planck 2015 data was made in order
to constrain the free parameters of the models. In the case of the

such as fresh names, variable binding and $\alpha$-equivalence on a
conveniently abstract categorical level. Coalgebras for endofunctors on nominal
sets model, e.g., various forms of automata with names as well as infinite
terms with variable binding operators (such as $\lambda$-abstraction). Here, we
first study the behaviour of orbit-finite coalgebras for functors $\bar F$ on
nominal sets that lift some finitary set functor $F$. We provide sufficient
conditions under which the rational fixpoint of $\bar F$, i.e. the collection
of all behaviours of orbit-finite $\bar F$-coalgebras, is the lifting of the
rational fixpoint of $F$. Second, we describe the rational fixpoint of the
quotient functors: we introduce the notion of a sub-strength of an endofunctor
on nominal sets, and we prove that for a functor $G$ with a sub-strength the
rational fixpoint of each quotient of $G$ is a canonical quotient of the
rational fixpoint of $G$. As applications, we obtain a concrete description of
the rational fixpoint for functors arising from so-called binding signatures
with exponentiation, such as those arising in coalgebraic models of infinitary
$\lambda$-terms and various flavours of automata.

dispersed nanoscale ferromagnetic particles suspended in a carrier fluid. Due
to their tiny size, individual ferromagnetic particles clearly exhibit Brownian

collaboration of the first gravitational-wave event GW150914. We conducted
unfiltered CCD observations (0.35-1 micron) with the 1.5-m telescope at Bosque
Alegre starting ~2.5 days after the alarm. Given our limited field of view
(~100 square arcmin), we targeted 14 nearby galaxies that were observable from
the site and were located within the area of higher localization probability.
  We analyzed the observations using two independent implementations of
difference-imaging algorithms, followed by a Random-Forest-based algorithm to
discriminate between real and bogus transients. We did not find any bona fide
transient event in the surveyed area down to a 5-sigma limiting magnitude of
r=21.7 mag (AB). Our result is consistent with the LIGO detection of a binary
black hole merger, for which no electromagnetic counterparts are expected, and
with the expected rates of other astrophysical transients.

distributions and mass distributions in stellar clusters, differentiating
between proposed mechanisms of massive star formation. We study the
substructure in the two largest fragments (i.e. cores) MM1 and MM2, in the

dust continuum observations towards MM1 and MM2. Combining these data with
Herschel observations, we carry out RADMC-3D radiative transfer modelling to
characterise the observed substructure.
  SMA continuum data indicates 4 sub-fragments in the SDC13 region. The nature
of the second brightest sub-fragment (B) is uncertain as it does not appear as
prominent at the lower MAMBO resolution or at radio wavelengths. Statistical
analysis indicates that it is unlikely to be a background source, an AGB star,
or the free-free emission of a HII region. It is plausible that B is a runaway
object ejected from MM1. MM1, which is actively forming stars, consists of two
sub-fragments A and C. This is confirmed by 70 micron Herschel data. While MM1
and MM2 appear quite similar in previous low resolution observations, at high
resolution, the sub-fragment at the centre of MM2 (D) is much fainter than
sub-fragment at the centre of MM1 (A). RADMC-3D models of MM1 and MM2 are able
to reproduce these results, modelling MM2 with a steeper density profile and
higher mass than is required for MM1. The relatively steep density profile of
MM2 depends on a significant temperature decrease in its centre, justified by

volatile prestellar fingerprint is modified by the chemistry en route into the
disc. This holds relatively independent of initial abundances and chemical
parameters: physical conditions are more important. The amount of CO2 increases
via the grain-surface reaction of OH with CO, which is enhanced by
photodissociation of H2O ice. Complex organic molecules are produced during
transport through the envelope at the expense of CH3OH ice. Their abundances
can be comparable to that of methanol ice (few % of water ice) at large disc
radii (R > 30 AU). Current Class II disc models may be underestimating the
complex organic content. Planet population synthesis models may underestimate
the amount of CO2 and overestimate CH3OH ices in planetesimals by disregarding
chemical processing between the cloud and disc phases. The overall C/O and C/N
ratios differ between the gas and solid phases. The two ice ratios show little
variation beyond the inner 10 AU and both are nearly solar in the case of pure
infall, but both are sub-solar when viscous spreading dominates. Chemistry in
the protostellar envelope en route to the protoplanetary disc sets the initial

properly (i.e. as originally designed - only for the local sources but not for
the cosmic background), remains a highly accurate numerical method for modeling
cosmic reionization. Simulated ionization and star formation histories from the
""Cosmic Reionization On Computers"" (CROC) project are insensitive to the
adopted value of the reduced speed of light for as long as that value does not
fall below about 10% of the true speed of light. A recent claim of the failure
of the RSL approximation in the Illustris reionization model appears to be due
to the effective speed of light being reduced in the equation for the cosmic
background too, and, hence, illustrates the importance of maintaining the
correct speed of light in modeling the cosmic background.

  Author's version, including Methods",,"10.1038/nature18638",,"astro-ph.SR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In solar-type stars (with radiative cores and convective envelopes), the
magnetic field powers star spots, flares and other solar phenomena, as well as
chromospheric and coronal emission at ultraviolet to X-ray wavelengths. The
dynamo responsible for generating the field depends on the shearing of internal
magnetic fields by differential rotation. The shearing has long been thought to
take place in a boundary layer known as the tachocline between the radiative
core and the convective envelope. Fully convective stars do not have a
tachocline and their dynamo mechanism is expected to be very different,
although its exact form and physical dependencies are not known. Here we report
observations of four fully convective stars whose X-ray emission correlates
with their rotation periods in the same way as in Sun-like stars. As the X-ray
activity - rotation relationship is a well-established proxy for the behaviour
of the magnetic dynamo, these results imply that fully convective stars also
operate a solar-type dynamo. The lack of a tachocline in fully convective stars
therefore suggests that this is not a critical ingredient in the solar dynamo
and supports models in which the dynamo originates throughout the convection
zone.

independently of the status of the quantum state. We also reformulate the other

pin down the notion of time symmetry involved more precisely. We show that our

in doing so, give a new interpretation of timelike violations of Bell

relatively flat luminosity function with slope ~0.5 below a characteristic

required to find planets, many $\delta$ Scuti stars have these amplitudes. In
sub-optimal cases where the signal-to-noise of the oscillations is lower,
low-mass brown dwarfs ($\sim$13 M$_{\rm Jup}$) are detectable at orbital
periods longer than about 1 yr, and the lowest mass main-sequence stars
(0.1-0.2 M$_{\odot}$) are detectable at all orbital periods where the PM method
can be applied. We use purpose-written Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) software
for the calculation of the PM orbits, which offers robust uncertainties for
comparison with RV solutions. Using Kepler data and ground-based RVs, we verify
that these two methods are in agreement, even at short orbital periods where
the PM method undersamples the orbit. We develop new theory to account for the
undersampling of the time delays, which is also necessary for the inclusion of
RVs as observational data in the MCMC software. We show that combining RVs with
time delays substantially refines the orbits because of the complementarity of
working in both the spatial (PM) and velocity (RV) domains simultaneously.
Software outputs were tested through an extensive hare and hounds exercise,

the star-formation history of galaxies in a cosmological context. The CWD model
unifies several starvation mechanisms known to disrupt or stop star formation
into one single physical framework. Galaxies begin accreting star-forming gas
at early times via a network of primordial filaments, simply related to the
pattern of density fluctuations in the initial conditions. But when
shell-crossing occurs on intergalactic scales, this pattern is disrupted, and
the galaxy detaches from its primordial filaments, ending the accretion of cold
gas. We argue that CWD encompasses known external processes halting star
formation, such as harassment, strangulation and starvation. On top of these
external processes, internal feedback processes such as AGN contribute to stop
in star formation as well.
  By explicitly pointing out the non-linear nature of CWD events we introduce a
simple formalism to identify CWD events in N-body simulations. With it we
reproduce and explain, in the context of CWD, several observations including

J173835.52+273258.9 (W1738) at both near- and mid-infrared wavelengths. This ~1
Gyr-old 400K dwarf is at a distance of 8pc and has a mass around 5 M_Jupiter.
We observed W1738 using two near-infrared filters at lambda~1um, Y and J, on
Gemini observatory, and two mid-infrared filters at lambda~4um, [3.6] and
[4.5], on the Spitzer observatory. Twenty-four hours were spent on the source
by Spitzer on each of June 30 and October 30 2013 UT. Between these
observations, around 5 hours were spent on the source by Gemini on each of July
17 and August 23 2013 UT. The mid-infrared light curves show significant
evolution between the two observations separated by four months. We find that a
double sinusoid can be fit to the [4.5] data, where one sinusoid has a period
of 6.0 +/- 0.1 hours and the other a period of 3.0 +/- 0.1 hours. The
near-infrared observations suggest variability with a ~3.0 hour period,
although only at a <~2 sigma confidence level. We interpret our results as
showing that the Y dwarf has a 6.0 +/- 0.1 hour rotation period, with one or
more large-scale surface features being the source of variability. The
peak-to-peak amplitude of the light curve at [4.5] is 3%. The amplitude of the
near-infrared variability, if real, may be as high as 5 to 30%. Intriguingly,
this size of variability and the wavelength dependence can be reproduced by
atmospheric models that include patchy KCl and Na_2S clouds and associated
small changes in surface temperature. The small number of large features, and
the timescale for evolution of the features, is very similar to what is seen in
the atmospheres of the solar system gas giants.

intersections, where vehicles arriving in a traffic intersection with no

quickly as possible. In this paper, we propose a coordination control algorithm
for this problem, assuming stochastic models for the arrival times of the
vehicles. The proposed algorithm provides provable guarantees on safety and
performance. More precisely, it is shown that no collisions occur surely, and
moreover a rigorous upper bound is provided for the expected wait time. The
algorithm is also demonstrated in simulations. The proposed algorithms are
inspired by polling systems. In fact, the problem studied in this paper leads
to a new polling system where customers are subject to differential

geometry. Although generally such entropies vanish at zero temperature,
consistent with the third law of thermodynamics (the Nernst heat theorem),
there is a region in the space of temperature and separation between the bodies
where negative entropy occurs, while positive interaction entropies arise for
large distances or temperatures. Systematic studies on this phenomenon in the
Casimir-Polder interaction between a polarizable nanoparticle or atom and a
conducting plate in the dipole approximation have been given recently. Since
the total entropy should be positive according to the second law of
thermodynamics, we expect that the self-entropy of the bodies would be
sufficiently positive as to overwhelm the negative interaction entropy. This
expectation, however, has not been explicitly verified. Here we compute the
self-entropy of an electromagnetic $\delta$-function plate, which corresponds
to a perfectly conducting sheet in the strong coupling limit. The transverse
electric contribution to the self-entropy is negative, while the transverse
magnetic contribution is larger and positive, so the total self-entropy is
positive. However, this self-entropy vanishes in the strong-coupling limit. In
that case, it is the self-entropy of the nanoparticle that is just sufficient
to result in a nonnegative total entropy.

with the chemical potential in the Integer Quantum Hall regime, the two Landau
levels can just cross or collapse while the external or pseudospin field that
induces the alignment changes. In this work, all possible crossings are
analyzed theoretically for the particular case of semiconductor trilayer
systems, using a variational Hartree-Fock approximation. The model includes
tunneling between neighboring layers, bias, intra-layer and inter-layer Coulomb
interaction among the electrons. We have found that the general pseudospin
anisotropy classification scheme used in bilayers applies also to the trilayer
situation, with the simple crossing corresponding to an easy-axis ferromagnetic
anisotropy analogy, and the collapse case corresponding to an easy-plane
ferromagnetic analogy. An isotropic case is also possible, with the levels just
crossing or collapsing depending on the filling factor and the quantum numbers
of the two nearby levels. While our results are valid for any integer filling
factor $\nu$ (=1,2,3,...), we have analyzed in detail the crossings at $\nu=3$
and $4$, and we have given clear predictions that will help in their
experimental search. In particular, the present calculations suggest that by
increasing the bias, the trilayer system at these two filling factors can be
driven from an easy-plane anisotropy regime to an easy-axis regime, and then
can be driven back to the easy-plane regime. This kind of reentrant behavior is
an unique feature of the trilayers, compared with the bilayers.

distributions. Introducing a systematic bias in the weak lensing redshift
distributions (of 0.05 in redshift) produces a $>2\sigma$ bias in the recovered
matter power spectrum amplitude and dark energy equation of state, for
preliminary Stage III surveys. We demonstrate that these cosmological errors
can be largely removed by marginalising over unknown biases in the assumed weak
lensing redshift distributions, if we assume high quality redshift information
for the galaxy clustering sample. Furthermore the cosmological constraining
power is mostly retained despite removing much of the information on the weak
lensing redshift distribution biases. We show that this comes from
complementary degeneracy directions between cosmic shear and the combination of
galaxy clustering with cross-correlation between shear and galaxy number
density. Finally we examine how the self-calibration performs when the assumed
distributions differ from the true distributions by more than a simple uniform
bias. We find that the effectiveness of this self-calibration method will
depend on the details of a given experiment and the nature of the uncertainties
on the estimated redshift distributions.

the restriction to the Gribov region in the Landau gauge. The model studied

and propagation characteristics of thermodynamically coupled, meridional
mode-like structures in the tropics. The model consists of a Gill-Matsuno type
steady atmosphere under the longwave approximation coupled via a
wind-evaporation-sea surface temperature (WES) feedback to a ""slab"" ocean
model. When projected onto basis functions for the atmosphere the system
simplifies to a non-normal set of equations that describes the evolution of
individual sea surface temperature (SST) modes, with clean separation between
symmetric and anti-symmetric modes. The following major findings result from
analysis of the system: (i) a transient growth process exists whereby specific
SST modes propagate toward lower order modes at the expense of the higher-order
modes; (ii) the same dynamical mechanisms govern the evolution of symmetric and
anti-symmetric SST modes except for the lowest-order wave number, where for
symmetric structures the atmospheric Kelvin wave plays a critically different
role in enhancing decay; and (iii) the WES feedback is positive for all modes
(with a maximum for the most equatorially confined antisymmetric structure)
except for the most equatorially confined symmetric mode where the Kelvin wave
generates a negative WES feedback. Taken together, these findings explain why
equatorially anti-symmetric ""dipole""-like structures may dominate
thermodynamically coupled ocean / atmosphere variability in the tropics. The
role of non-normality as well as the role of realistic mean states in
meridional mode variability are discussed.

reductions in transmission rates from the content-hosting server to the end
users. Coded caching is a generalization of conventional caching that considers
the possibility of coding in the caches and transmitting coded signals from the
server. Prior results in this area demonstrate that huge reductions in
transmission rates are possible and this makes coded caching an attractive
option for the next generation of content-delivery networks. However, these
results require that each file hosted in the server be partitioned into a large
number (i.e., the subpacketization level) of non-overlapping subfiles. From a
practical perspective, this is problematic as it means that prior schemes are
only applicable when the size of the files is extremely large. In this work, we
propose a novel coded caching scheme that enjoys a significantly lower
subpacketization level than prior schemes, while only suffering a marginal
increase in the transmission rate. In particular, for a fixed cache size, the
scaling with the number of users is such that the increase in transmission rate
is negligible, but the decrease in subpacketization level is exponential.

observed for the $q$th-order Hilbert moment $\mathcal{L}_q(k)$. This
dual-power-law belongs to an inverse-cascade since the scaling range is above

exponents $\zeta(q)$ of both the small-scale \red{(resp. $k>k_{\nu}$) and

Recently, belief propagation (BP) has emerged as a promising method for
estimating the marginal probabilities of measurement to target association,
providing fast, accurate estimates. The excellent performance of BP in the
particular formulation used may be attributed to the convexity of the
underlying free energy which it implicitly optimises. This paper studies
multiple scan data association problems, i.e., problems that reason over
correspondence between targets and several sets of measurements, which may
correspond to different sensors or different time steps. We find that the

demonstrate the undesirable behaviour that can result. A convex free energy is
constructed using the recently proposed fractional free energy (FFE). A
convergent, BP-like algorithm is provided for the single scan FFE, and employed
in optimising the multiple scan free energy using primal-dual coordinate
ascent. Finally, based on a variational interpretation of joint probabilistic

is similar to JPDA, but retains consistency constraints from prior scans. The

Steganography is a technique that hides a secret message in the SMS. We propose

developed for constrained $k$-submodular maximization, except for the case of

calibration of single-polarisation KVN data using the KVN Pipeline and
comparing the results against VLBI data that has been manually reduced. We find
that the pipelined data using phase transfer produces better results than a

the pipeline results with a manually reduced phase-transferred dataset and
found the results to be identical.

The soft-violation term is introduced to avoid massless-axion particles arising

metastable states through the possible presence of multiple non-degenerate
minima, which is unwanted from the phenomenological point of view if the
metastable state is not long-lived enough. The analysis of this fact leads to
find possible exclusion limits over parameter space of quartic couplings.
Results improve the individual behavior of initial conditions for
renormalization group equations; also determining unstable zones for the
effective Higgs potential at one loop level. Besides vacuum stability analyses,
the influence of absence of charge violation minima is considered as a limiting
case excluding zones in the parameter space. Extremal cases for the model as
well as criticality phenomena are discussed with the aid of relation among
Higgs masses or splittings among them. From vacuum behavior and LHC results,
phenomenological aspects in the searching of charged and heavier Higgs bosons

rises when approaching the peripheral sites to compensate the rise of the

shorter than the plasma wavelength are considered. It is turned out that the
system shows adiabatic behavior as long as the plasma evolves very slowly in
the Pulse Co-Moving (PCM) frame due to the ignorable radiation back-reactions.
A sophisticated treatment of the adiabatic regime is presented, based on the
proper application of the local conservation laws in the PCM frame in
conjunction with the Lorentz transformations. In this context, equations for
the overall pulse evolutions are reduced into a single equation in terms of the
global pulse group-velocity. Due to the proven equality between the local phase
velocities of the plasma wave and the radiation, anomalies are observed in this
regime, in the global group velocity and the plasma dispersion. The group
velocity shows non-explicit density dependency and of remaining above the
linear value over a long period of the propagation. These results are
successfully examined against PIC simulations and their consistency with the
other system evolutions and the physical intuition is fully discussed.
Afterward, the interaction locality is examined in terms of the plasma
dispersion and the resultant spectral evolutions. And it is found that for
pulse lengths larger than the plasma wavelength, the plasma-wave evolutions
inside the pulse region result in the strong light phase-modulation along with
the amplitude-modulation and whereby violation of the adiabatic description.
The development of these phenomena is by production of the effective radiation
back-reactions.

to describe from the geometrical, topological, and algebraic viewpoints a
canonical locally finite partition of a reduced complex analytic space $X$ into
nonsingular strata with the property that the local geometry of $X$ is constant
on each stratum. Local polar varieties appear in the title because they play a
central role in the unification of viewpoints. The geometrical viewpoint leads
to the study of spaces of limit directions at a given point of $X\subset \C^n$
of hyperplanes of $\C^n$ tangent to $X$ at nonsingular points, which in turn
leads to the realization that the Whitney conditions, which are used to define
the stratification, are in fact of a Lagrangian nature. The local polar
varieties are used to analyze the structure of the set of limit directions of
tangent hyperplanes. This structure helps in particular to understand how a
singularity differs from its tangent cone, assumed to be reduced. The
multiplicities of local polar varieties are related to local topological
invariants, local vanishing Euler-Poincar\'e characteristics, by a formula
which turns out to contain, in the special case where the singularity is the
vertex of the cone over a reduced projective variety, a Pl\""ucker-type formula
for the degree of the dual of a projective variety. The degree of the dual of a
projective variety is expressed in terms of Euler-Poincar\'e characteristics

However, creating such tutorials requires expert knowledge and is a
time-consuming task. As a result, the availability of tutorials for a given
object or viewpoint is limited. How2Sketch addresses this problem by
automatically generating easy-to-follow tutorials for arbitrary 3D objects.
Given a segmented 3D model and a camera viewpoint,it computes a sequence of
steps for constructing a drawing scaffold comprised of geometric primitives,
which helps the user draw the final contours in correct perspective and
proportion. To make the drawing scaffold easy to construct, the algorithm
solves for an ordering among the scaffolding primitives and explicitly makes
small geometric modifications to the size and location of the object parts to
simplify relative positioning. Technically, we formulate this scaffold
construction as a single selection problem that simultaneously solves for the
ordering and geometric changes of the primitives. We demonstrate our algorithm
for generating tutorials on a variety of man-made objects and evaluate how
easily the tutorials can be followed with a user study.

Its interaction with the dust is the key to our understanding planet formation
later on in the protoplanetary disc stage. Studying the gas content is a
crucial step towards understanding YSO and planet formation. Such a study can
be made through spectroscopic observations of emission lines in the
far-infrared, where some of the most important gas coolants emit. We provide a
compilation of observations of far-IR lines in 362 young stellar objects
covering all evolutionary stages, from Class 0 to Class III with debris discs.
In the present paper we focus on [OI] and o-H2O emission at 63 microns. We have
retrieved all the available Herschel -PACS spectroscopic observations at 63
microns that used the dominant observing mode, the chop-nod technique. We
provide measurements of line fluxes for the [OI] 3P1-3P2 and o-H2O 808-717
transitions at 63 microns computed using different methods. We check for
spatially extended emission and further study the presence of multiple
dynamical components in line emission. The final compilation consists of line
and continuum fluxes at 63 microns for a total of 362 young stellar objects
(YSOs). We detected [OI] line emission at 63 microns in 194 sources out of 362,
and line absorption in another five sources. o-H2O was detected in 42 sources.
We find evidence of extended [OI] emission in 77 sources, and detect 3sigma
residual emission in 71 of them. We also looked for different components
contributing to the line emission, and found evidence for multiple components
in 30 sources. We explored correlations between line emission and continuum
emission and find a clear correlation between WISE fluxes from 4.6 to 22
microns and [OI] line emission. We conclude that the observed emission is
typically a combination of disc/envelope and jet emission.

Despite over four decades of intense research efforts in this area, there is
still some debate over the nature of the first water monolayer on the
technologically-relevant anatase TiO$_2$ (101) surface. In this work we use
first-principles calculations to reverse-engineer the experimental
high-resolution X-ray photoelectron spectra measured for this surface in [Walle

existence of a mix of dissociated and molecular water in the first monolayer.
Using both semilocal and hybrid functional calculations we revise the current
understanding of the adsorption energetics by showing that the energetic cost
of water dissociation is reduced via the formation of a hydrogen-bonded
hydroxyl-water complex. We also show that such a complex can provide an
explanation of an unusual superstructure observed in high-resolution scanning
tunneling microscopy experiments.

propose and implement a new scheme of generating this state. Two nonlinear
optical crystals, positioned back-to-back in the waist of a pump beam, function
as single-pass degenerate optical parametric amplifiers and produce single-mode
squeezed vacuum states in orthogonal polarization modes, but in the same
spatiotemporal mode. A subsequent pair of waveplates acts as a beam splitter,
entangling the two polarization modes to generate the Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen
state. This technique takes advantage of the strong nonlinearity associated
with type-I phase-matching configuration while at the same time eliminating the
need for actively stabilizing the optical phase between the two squeezers,
which typically arises if these squeezers are spatially separated. We
demonstrate our method in an experiment, preparing a 1.4 dB two-mode squeezed
state and characterizing it via two-mode homodyne tomography.

The
usual understanding of it depends on the choice of the basis, that is, the
coherence of the same quantum state is different within different reference
framework. To reveal all the potential coherence, we present the total quantum
coherence measures in terms of two different methods. One is optimizing maximal
basis-dependent coherence with all potential bases considered and the other is
quantifying the distance between the state and the incoherent state set.
Interestingly, the coherence measures based on relative entropy and $l_2$ norm
have the same form in the two different methods. In particular, we show that
the measures based on the non-contractive $l_2$ norm is also a good measure
different from the basis-dependent coherence. In addition, we show that all the
measures are analytically calculable and have all the good properties. The
experimental schemes for the detection of these coherence measures are also
proposed by multiple copies of quantum states instead of reconstructing the
full density matrix. By studying one type of quantum probing schemes, we find
that both the normalized trace in the scheme of deterministic quantum
computation with one qubit (DQC1) and the overlap of two states in quantum
overlap measurement schemes (QOM) can be well described by the change of total
coherence of the probing qubit. Hence the nontrivial probing always leads to
the change of the total coherence.

been performed. The metal/insulator structure with magnetic coupling between
both layers allows the measurement of the modulation of the transport
properties exclusively in the antiferromagnetic layer. Anisotropic
magnetoresistance as large as 0.15 % has been found, which is much larger than
that for a bare IrMn layer. Interestingly, it has been observed that
anisotropic magnetoresistance is strongly influenced by the field cooling
conditions, signaling the dependence of the found response on the formation of

observation at NIR. The deep narrow-band and multi broadband data allow us to
find LAEs of stellar masses and star-formation rates (SFRs) down to
$\gtrsim$$10^8$ M$_\odot$ and $\gtrsim$0.2 M$_\odot$/yr, respectively. We show
that the LAEs are located along the same mass-SFR sequence traced by normal
star-forming galaxies such as HAEs, but towards a significantly lower mass
regime. Likewise, LAEs seem to share the same mass--size relation with typical
star-forming galaxies, except for the massive LAEs, which tend to show
significantly compact sizes. We identify a vigorous mass growth in the central
part of LAEs: the stellar mass density in the central region of LAEs increases
as their total galaxy mass grows. On the other hand, we see no Ly$\alpha$ line
in emission for most of the HAEs. Rather, we find that the Ly$\alpha$ feature
is either absent or in absorption (Ly$\alpha$ absorbers; LAAs), and its
absorption strength may increase with reddening of the UV continuum slope. We
demonstrate that a deep Ly$\alpha$ narrow-band imaging like this study is able
to search for not only LAEs but also LAAs in a certain redshift slice. This
work suggests that LAEs trace normal star-forming galaxies in the low-mass
regime, while they remain as a unique population because the majority of HAEs
are not LAEs.

astrophysical neutrino flux using neutrino events with interaction vertices
contained within the instrumented volume of the IceCube detector. We present a
complementary measurement using charged current muon neutrino events where the
interaction vertex can be outside this volume. As a consequence of the large
muon range the effective area is significantly larger but the field of view is
restricted to the Northern Hemisphere. IceCube data from 2009 through 2015 have
been analyzed using a likelihood approach based on the reconstructed muon
energy and zenith angle. At the highest neutrino energies between 191 TeV and
8.3 PeV a significant astrophysical contribution is observed, excluding a
purely atmospheric origin of these events at $5.6\,\sigma$ significance. The
data are well described by an isotropic, unbroken power law flux with a
normalization at 100 TeV neutrino energy of
$\left(0.90^{+0.30}_{-0.27}\right)\times10^{-18}\,\mathrm{GeV^{-1}\,cm^{-2}\,s^{-1}\,sr^{-1}}$
and a hard spectral index of $\gamma=2.13\pm0.13$. The observed spectrum is
harder in comparison to previous IceCube analyses with lower energy thresholds
which may indicate a break in the astrophysical neutrino spectrum of unknown
origin. The highest energy event observed has a reconstructed muon energy of
$(4.5\pm1.2)\,\mathrm{PeV}$ which implies a probability of less than 0.005% for
this event to be of atmospheric origin. Analyzing the arrival directions of all
events with reconstructed muon energies above 200 TeV no correlation with known
$\gamma$-ray sources was found. Using the high statistics of atmospheric
neutrinos we report the currently best constraints on a prompt atmospheric muon
neutrino flux originating from charmed meson decays which is below $1.06$ in
units of the flux normalization of the model in Enberg et al. (2008).

coupling, induced by cobalt (Co) and nickel (Ni) in graphene, via a few (up to
three) layers of hexagonal boron nitride (hBN). We find that the induced spin
splitting of the graphene bands is of the order of 10 meV for a monolayer of
hBN, decreasing in magnitude but alternating in sign by adding each new
insulating layer. We find that the proximity exchange can be giant if there is
a resonant $d$ level of the transition metal close to the Dirac point. Our
calculations suggest that this effect could be present in Co heterostructures,
in which a $d$ level strongly hybridizes with the valence-band orbitals of
graphene. Since this hybridization is spin dependent, the proximity spin
splitting is unusually large, about 10 meV even for two layers of hBN. An
external electric field can change the offset of the graphene and
transition-metal orbitals and can lead to a reversal of the sign of the
exchange parameter. This we predict to happen for the case of two monolayers of
hBN, enabling electrical control of proximity spin polarization (but also spin
injection) in graphene/hBN/Co structures. Nickel-based heterostructures show
weaker proximity effects than cobalt heterostructures. We introduce two
phenomenological models to describe the first-principles data. The minimal
model comprises the graphene (effective) $p_z$ orbitals and can be used to
study transport in graphene with proximity exchange, while the $p_z$-$d$ model
also includes hybridization with $d$ orbitals, which is important to capture
the giant proximity exchange. Crucial to both models is the
pseudospin-dependent exchange coupling, needed to describe the different spin
splittings of the valence and conduction bands.

hadron-hadron collisions with a cone-type jet algorithm. We also apply the beam
veto to the beam jets consisting of the initial radiation. The soft-collinear
effective theory is employed to see the factorization structure transparently
when there are four distinct lightcone directions involved. There are various
types of divergences such as the ultraviolet and infrared divergences. And when
the phase space is divided to probe the collinear and the soft parts, there
appears an additional divergence called rapidity divergence. These divergences
are sorted out and we will show that all the infrared and rapidity divergences
cancel, and only the ultraviolet divergence remains. It is a vital step to
justify the factorization. Among many partonic processes, we take
$q\overline{q} \rightarrow gg$ as a specific example to consider the dijet
cross section. The hard and the soft functions have nontrivial color structure,
while the jet and the beam functions are diagonal in operator basis. The
dependence of the soft anomalous dimension on the jet algorithm and the beam
veto is diagonal in operator space, and is cancelled by that of the jet and
beam functions. We also compute the anomalous dimensions of the factorized

swarming state and move in dense swarms across surfaces. A recent experiment
measured the flow in the fluid around an Escherichia coli swarm (Wu, Hosu and
Berg, 2011 Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 108 4147). A systematic chiral flow was
observed in the clockwise direction (when viewed from above) ahead of the swarm
with flow speeds of about $10~\mu$m/s, about 3 times greater than the radial
velocity at the edge of the swarm. The working hypothesis is that this flow is
due to the action of cells stalled at the edge of a colony that extend their
flagellar filaments outwards, moving fluid over the virgin agar. In this work
we quantitatively test his hypothesis. We first build an analytical model of
the flow induced by a single flagellum in a thin film and then use the model,
and its extension to multiple flagella, to compare with experimental
measurements. The results we obtain are in agreement with the flagellar
hypothesis. The model provides further quantitative insight into the flagella
orientations and their spatial distributions as well as the tangential speed
profile. In particular, the model suggests that flagella are on average

that a more precise and more informative News Impact Function can be estimated

formation in galaxies. The H$_{2}$ molecule does not emit efficiently in the
cold interstellar medium, hence the molecular gas content of galaxies is
typically inferred using indirect tracers. At low metallicity and in other
extreme environments, these tracers can be subject to substantial biases. We
present a new method of estimating total molecular gas mass in galaxies
directly from pure mid-infrared rotational H$_{2}$ emission. By assuming a
power-law distribution of H$_{2}$ rotational temperatures, we can accurately
model H$_{2}$ excitation and reliably obtain warm ($T\!\gtrsim\!100$ K) H$_{2}$
gas masses by varying only the power law's slope. With sensitivities typical of
Spitzer/IRS, we are able to directly probe the H$_{2}$ content via rotational
emission down to ~80 K, accounting for ~15% of the total molecular gas mass in
a galaxy. By extrapolating the fitted power law temperature distributions to a
calibrated \emph{single} lower cutoff temperature, the model also recovers the
total molecular content within a factor of ~2.2 in a diverse sample of
galaxies, and a subset of broken power law models performs similarly well. In
ULIRGs, the fraction of warm H$_{2}$ gas rises with dust temperature, with some
dependency on $\alpha_\mathrm{CO}$. In a sample of five low metallicity
galaxies ranging down to 12+log[O/H]=7.8, the model yields molecular masses up
to ~100 times larger than implied by CO, in good agreement with other methods
based on dust mass and star formation depletion timescale. This technique

of a generative model and a discriminative classifier, where features are
learned by shallow and deep architectures, respectively. For the generative
model, we introduce a block-based incremental learning scheme, in which a local
binary mask is constructed to deal with occlusion. The similarity degrees
between the local patches and their corresponding subspace are integrated to
formulate a more accurate global appearance model. In the discriminative model,
we exploit the advances of deep learning architectures to learn generic
features which are robust to both background clutters and foreground appearance
variations. To this end, we first construct a discriminative training set from
auxiliary video sequences. A deep classification neural network is then trained
offline on this training set. Through online fine-tuning, both the hierarchical
feature extractor and the classifier can be adapted to the appearance change of
the target for effective online tracking. The collaboration of these two models
achieves a good balance in handling occlusion and target appearance change,
which are two contradictory challenging factors in visual tracking. Both
quantitative and qualitative evaluations against several state-of-the-art
algorithms on challenging image sequences demonstrate the accuracy and the
robustness of the proposed tracker.

cosmic acceleration can be addressed by the infrared corrections. As a
particular example, we applied the setup to the case of matter dominated
universe. This model has the same number of parameters as $\Lambda$CDM, but a
dynamical dark energy generates in the matter dominated era at the late time.
According to our model, as the universe expands, the energy density of the cold
dark matter dilutes and when the Hubble parameter approaches to its minimum,
the infrared effects dominate such that the effective equation of state
parameter smoothly changes from $w_{_{\rm eff}}=0$ to $w_{_{\rm eff}}=-2$.
Interestingly and nontrivially, the unstable de Sitter phase with $w_{_{\rm

the phantom divide from the quintessence phase with $w_{_{\rm eff}}>-1$ and
$\Omega_m> \Omega_d$ to the phantom phase with $w_{_{\rm eff}}<-1$ and $
\Omega_m<\Omega_d$ which shows that the model is observationally viable. The
results show that the universe finally ends up in a big rip singularity for a
finite time proportional to the inverse of the minimum of the Hubble parameter.
Moreover, we consider the dynamical stability of the model and we show that the
universe starts from the matter dominated era at the past attractor with
$w_{_{\rm eff}}=0$ and ends up in a future attractor at the big rip with
$w_{_{\rm eff}}=-2$.

dominantly come from the jet. The millimeter radiation from ADAF dominantly
come from the region within $10R_{\rm g}$, which is roughly consistent with the
recent very long baseline interferometry observations at 230\,GHz. We further
calculate the Faraday rotation measure (RM) from both ADAF and jet models, and

$^{34}$Na on $^{208}$Pb to give us a core of $^{33}$Na with a neutron and in
the process we try and investigate the one neutron separation energy and the
ground state configuration of $^{34}$Na.
  Method : A fully quantum mechanical Coulomb breakup theory within the
architecture of post-form finite range distorted wave Born approximation
extended to include the effects of deformation is used to research the elastic
Coulomb breakup of $^{34}$Na on $^{208}$Pb at 100 MeV/u. The triple
differential cross-section calculated for the breakup is integrated over the
desired components to find the total cross-section, momentum and angular
distributions as well as the average momenta, along with the energy-angular

  Results : The total one neutron removal cross-section is calculated to test
the possible ground state configurations of $^{34}$Na. The average momentum
results along with energy-angular calculations indicate $^{34}$Na to have a
halo structure. The parallel momentum distributions with narrow full widths at
half maxima signify the same.
  Conclusion : We have attempted to analyse the possible ground state

neutron halo with a predominant contribution to its ground state most probably
coming from $^{33}$Na($3/2^{+}$) $\otimes$ $2p_{3/2}\nu$ configuration. We also

with an experiment to put stricter limits on its ground state configuration and

unknown. Recent works report the evidence for a possible positional correlation
between the reconstructed neutrino arrival directions and the positions in the
sky of low power, high-energy emitting BL Lac objects (HBL). Assuming that
$\gamma$-ray emitting HBL form the bulk of the sources of high-energy neutrinos
above 100 TeV, we intend to calculate the number of events expected to be
detected for each source by IceCube and KM3NeT. Based on a simple
theoretically-motivated framework inspired by the structured jet scenario for
these sources, we postulate a direct proportionality between high-energy
$\gamma$-ray and neutrino fluxes. We calculate the expected neutrino event rate
for the HBL sources of the Second Fermi-LAT Catalog of High-Energy Sources
(2FHL) for IceCube and the presently under construction KM3NeT using
declination-dependent and exposure-weighted effective areas. We provide a list
of 2FHL HBL with the calculated number of events. For IceCube, the derived
count rate for several sources is relatively high, of the order of $\lesssim$1
yr$^{-1}$, consistently with the recent findings of a possible positional
correlation. For KM3NeT the calculated rates are higher, with several sources
with expected rate exceeding 1 yr$^{-1}$. This, coupled with the improved
angular resolution, implies that the HBL origin can be effectively tested with
few years of observation of KM3NeT (and IceCube Gen2, for which similar
performances are foreseen) through the direct association of neutrinos and
single HBL. Our results show that if -- as hinted by recent works -- HBL
represent a possible population of high-energy neutrino emitters, several
single sources should be identified in few years of exposure of KM3NeT,
highlighting the importance of the improved angular resolution anticipated for
KM3NeT and IceCube Gen2.

affecting more than 1.2 million people in Europe. Medications are available for
the management of its symptoms, but the exact cause of the disease is unknown
and there is currently no cure on the market. To better understand the
relations between new findings and current medical knowledge, we need tools
able to analyse published medical papers based on natural language processing
and tools capable to identify various relationships of new findings with the
current medical knowledge. Our work aims to fill the above technological gap.
  To identify conflicting information in medical documents, we enact textual
entailment technology. To encapsulate existing medical knowledge, we rely on
ontologies. To connect the formal axioms in ontologies with natural text in
medical articles, we exploit ontology verbalisation techniques. To assess the
level of disagreement between human agents with respect to a medical issue, we
rely on fuzzy aggregation. To harmonize this disagreement, we design mediation
protocols within a multi-agent framework.

From the philosophical point of view, it tries to formalize how the statistics
works and why some statistical models are better than others. After this notion
of a ""good model"" is introduced, a natural question arises: it is possible that
for some piece of data there is no good model? If yes, how often these bad
(""non-stochastic"") data appear ""in real life""?
  Another, more technical motivation comes from algorithmic information theory.
In this theory a notion of complexity of a finite object (=amount of
information in this object) is introduced; it assigns to every object some
number, called its algorithmic complexity (or Kolmogorov complexity).
Algorithmic statistic provides a more fine-grained classification: for each
finite object some curve is defined that characterizes its behavior. It turns
out that several different definitions give (approximately) the same curve.
  In this survey we try to provide an exposition of the main results in the
field (including full proofs for the most important ones), as well as some
historical comments. We assume that the reader is familiar with the main

(UTMs): abstract machines able to execute all possible algorithms. Modern
digital computers are physical embodiments of UTMs. The nondeterministic
polynomial (NP) time complexity class of problems is the most significant in
computer science, and an efficient (i.e. polynomial P) way to solve such
problems would be of profound economic and social importance. By definition
nondeterministic UTMs (NUTMs) solve NP complete problems in P time. However,
NUTMs have previously been believed to be physically impossible to construct.
Thue string rewriting systems are computationally equivalent to UTMs, and are
naturally nondeterministic. Here we describe the physical design for a NUTM
that implements a universal Thue system. The design exploits the ability of DNA
to replicate to execute an exponential number of computational paths in P time.
Each Thue rewriting step is embodied in a DNA edit implemented using a novel
combination of polymerase chain reactions and site-directed mutagenesis. We
demonstrate that this design works using both computational modelling and in
vitro molecular biology experimentation. The current design has limitations,
such as restricted error-correction. However, it opens up the prospect of
engineering NUTM based computers able to outperform all standard computers on
important practical problems.

can also be introduced by the influences of star spots on the shape of the
transit profile. Here we use the method of unsharp masking to investigate the
photometric light curves of planets with ambiguous TTV to compare the features
in their O - C diagram with the occurrence and in-transit positions of
spot-crossing events. This method seems to be particularly useful for the
examination of transit light curves with only small numbers of in-transit data

eruption ten times, including yearly eruptions from 2008-2014. With a measured
recurrence period of $P_\mathrm{rec}=351\pm13$ days (we believe the true value
to be half of this) and a white dwarf very close to the Chandrasekhar limit,
M31N 2008-12a has become the leading pre-explosion supernova type Ia progenitor
candidate. Following multi-wavelength follow-up observations of the 2013 and
2014 eruptions, we initiated a campaign to ensure early detection of the
predicted 2015 eruption, which triggered ambitious ground and space-based
follow-up programs. In this paper we present the 2015 detection; visible to
near-infrared photometry and visible spectroscopy; and ultraviolet and X-ray
observations from the Swift observatory. The LCOGT 2m (Hawaii) discovered the
2015 eruption, estimated to have commenced at Aug. $28.28\pm0.12$ UT. The
2013-2015 eruptions are remarkably similar at all wavelengths. New early
spectroscopic observations reveal short-lived emission from material with
velocities $\sim13000$ km s$^{-1}$, possibly collimated outflows. Photometric
and spectroscopic observations of the eruption provide strong evidence
supporting a red giant donor. An apparently stochastic variability during the
early super-soft X-ray phase was comparable in amplitude and duration to past
eruptions, but the 2013 and 2015 eruptions show evidence of a brief flux dip
during this phase. The multi-eruption Swift/XRT spectra show tentative evidence
of high-ionization emission lines above a high-temperature continuum. Following
Henze et al. (2015a), the updated recurrence period based on all known
eruptions is $P_\mathrm{rec}=174\pm10$ d, and we expect the next eruption of
M31N 2008-12a to occur around mid-Sep. 2016.

through different paths in the medium. However, when the scattering medium also
exhibits nonlinearity, as may occur in multiphoton microscopy, this assumption
is violated and the applicability of wavefront shaping becomes unclear. Here we
show, using a simple model system with a scattering layer followed by a

still be controlled and focused through a scattering medium in the presence of

and quantum gravity, which have not been considered in literature. As is well
known, the presence of virtual particles in vacuum provides the so famous and
puzzling contributions to the vacuum energy. As is well known, these mainly
come from loop integrations over the four-momenta space. However, we argue that
these also imply the presence of a mass density of virtual particles in every
volume cell of space-time. The most important contribution comes from quantum
gravity $S^{2}\times S^{2}$ bubbles, corresponding to virtual black hole pairs.
The presence of virtual masses could lead to another paradox: the space-time
itself would have an intrinsic virtual mass density contribution leading to a
disastrous contraction - as is known, no negative masses exist in general
relativity. We dub this effect {\it the cosmological problem of second type}:
if not other counter-terms existed, the vacuum energy would be inevitably
destabilized by virtual-mass contributions. It would be conceivable that the
cosmological problem of second type could solve the first one. Virtual masses
renormalize the vacuum energy to an unpredicted parameter, as in the
renormalization procedure of the Standard Model charges. In the limit of
$M_{Pl}\rightarrow \infty$ (Pauli-Villars limit), virtual black holes have a
mass density providing an infinite counter-term to the vacuum energy divergent
contribution $M_{Pl} \rightarrow \infty$ (assuming $M_{UV}=M_{Pl}$). Therefore,
in the same Schwinger-Feynman-Tomonaga attitude, the problem of a divergent
vacuum energy could be analogous to the {\it put-by-hand} procedure used for
Standard Model parameters.

we propose a novel maximum likelihood solution to the PnP problem, that

for the spatially varying wettability through a Derjaguin (or disjoining)

boundary is developed. Macroscopic laws of transport are described by PDEs.
When the system is open, there are several mechanisms to couple the system with
the external forces. Here a class of systems where the interaction with the
exterior takes place in correspondence of a free boundary is considered. Both
continuous and discrete models sharing the same structure are analyzed. In Part
I a free boundary problem related to the Stefan Problem is worked out in all
details. For this model a new notion of relaxed solution is proposed for which
global existence and uniqueness is proven. It is also shown that this is the
hydrodynamic limit of the empirical mass density of the associated particle
system. In Part II several other models are discussed. The expectation is that
the results proved for the basic model extend to these other cases. All the
models discussed in this volume have an interest in problems arising in several
research fields such as heat conduction, queuing theory, propagation of fire,
interface dynamics, population dynamics, evolution of biological systems with
selection mechanisms.In general researchers interested in the relations between
PDEs and stochastic processes can find in this volume an extension of this
correspondence to modern mathematical physics.

connectivity by discriminating the total set of particles into different

this methodology we show how the particle bonding process is not randomly
independent but it manifests clear bond correlations at low temperatures. We
further explore the dynamics of the system in real space and establish a clear
relation between particle mobility and particle connectivity. In particular, we
provide evidence of anomalous diffusion at low temperatures and reveal how the
dynamics is affected by the short-time hopping motion of the weakly bounded

one dynamic and the other one static, which increase upon cooling the system

Disaccord arises whenever editors with different opinions try to produce an

with extremist views. Using a model of common value production, we show that
the consensus can only be reached if extremist groups can actively take part in

the role of direct communication between editors both in the model and in

estimate a full 3D mesh and show that 2D joints alone carry a surprising amount
of information about body shape. The problem is challenging because of the
complexity of the human body, articulation, occlusion, clothing, lighting, and
the inherent ambiguity in inferring 3D from 2D. To solve this, we first use a
recently published CNN-based method, DeepCut, to predict (bottom-up) the 2D
body joint locations. We then fit (top-down) a recently published statistical
body shape model, called SMPL, to the 2D joints. We do so by minimizing an
objective function that penalizes the error between the projected 3D model
joints and detected 2D joints. Because SMPL captures correlations in human
shape across the population, we are able to robustly fit it to very little
data. We further leverage the 3D model to prevent solutions that cause
interpenetration. We evaluate our method, SMPLify, on the Leeds Sports,
HumanEva, and Human3.6M datasets, showing superior pose accuracy with respect

after inflation. In the inflationary Universe, i.e., de Sitter space, the
vacuum field fluctuations $\left< {\delta \phi }^{ 2 } \right>$ enlarge in
proportion to the Hubble scale $H^{2}$. Therefore, the large inflationary
vacuum fluctuations of the Higgs field $\left< {\delta \phi }^{ 2 } \right>$
are potentially catastrophic to trigger the vacuum transition to the
negative-energy Planck-scale vacuum state and cause an immediate collapse of
the Universe. However, the vacuum field fluctuations $\left< {\delta \phi }^{ 2
} \right>$, i.e., the vacuum expectation values have an ultraviolet divergence,
and therefore a renormalization is necessary to estimate the physical effects
of the vacuum transition. Thus, in this paper, we revisit the electroweak
vacuum instability from the perspective of quantum field theory (QFT) in curved
space-time, and discuss the dynamical behavior of the homogeneous Higgs field
$\phi$ determined by the effective potential ${ V }_{\rm eff}\left( \phi
\right)$ in curved space-time and the renormalized vacuum fluctuations $\left<
{\delta \phi }^{ 2 } \right>_{\rm ren}$ via adiabatic regularization and
point-splitting regularization. We simply suppose that the Higgs field only
couples the gravity via the non-minimal Higgs-gravity coupling $\xi(\mu)$. In
this scenario, the electroweak vacuum stability is inevitably threatened by the
dynamical behavior of the homogeneous Higgs field $\phi$, or the formations of
AdS domains or bubbles unless the Hubble scale is small enough $H< \Lambda_{I}
$.

positive feedback can lead to overload and saturation of decision-making
elements, and ultimately the cascading collapse of an organization due to the
propagation of overload and erroneous decisions throughout the organization. We
begin the paper with an analysis of the stability of the decision-making
aspects of command organizations from a system-theoretic perspective. A simple
dynamic model shows how an organization can enter into a self-reinforcing cycle
of increasing decision workload until the demand for decisions exceeds the
decision-making capacity of the organization. We then extend the model to more
complex networked organizations and show that they also experience a form of
self-reinforcing degradation. In particular, we find that the degradation in
decision quality has a tendency to propagate through the hierarchical
structure, i.e. overload at one location affects other locations by overloading
the higher-level components which then in turn overload their subordinates. Our
computational experiments suggest several strategies for mitigating this type
of malfunction: dumping excessive load, empowering lower echelons, minimizing
the need for coordination, using command-by-negation, insulating weak
performers, and applying on-line diagnostics. We describe a method to allocate
decision responsibility and arrange information flow dynamically within a team

DM. We report on a search for the annihilations of DM particles using
$\gamma$-ray observations towards the inner 300 parsecs of the Milky Way, with
the H.E.S.S. array of ground-based Cherenkov telescopes. The analysis is based
on a 2D maximum likelihood method using Galactic center (GC) data accumulated
by H.E.S.S. over the last 10 years (2004-2014), and does not show any
significant $\gamma$-ray signal above background. Assuming Einasto and
Navarro-Frenk-White DM density profiles at the GC, we derive upper limits on
the annihilation cross section $\langle \sigma v\rangle$. These constraints are
the strongest obtained so far in the TeV DM mass range and improve upon
previous limits by a factor 5. For the Einasto profile, the constraints reach
$\langle \sigma v\rangle$ values of $\rm 6\times10^{-26} cm^3s^{-1}$ in the
$W^+W^-$ channel for a DM particle mass of 1.5 TeV, and $\rm 2\times10^{-26}
cm^3s^{-1}$ in the $\tau^+\tau^-$ channel for 1 TeV mass. For the first time,
ground-based $\gamma$-ray observations have reached sufficient sensitivity to
probe $\langle \sigma v\rangle$ values expected from the thermal relic density
for TeV DM particles.

substrate to graphene by greatly improving the material transport properties
thanks to its atomically flat surface, low interlayer electronic coupling and
almost perfect reticular matching. Chemical vapour deposition (CVD) is
presently considered the most scalable approach to grow graphene directly on
h-BN. However, for the catalyst-free approach, poor control over the shape and
crystallinity of the graphene grains and low growth rates are typically
reported. In this work we investigate the crystallinity of differently shaped
grains and identify a path towards a real van der Waals epitaxy of graphene on
h-BN by adopting a catalyst-free CVD process. We demonstrate the
polycrystalline nature of circular-shaped pads and attribute the stemming of
different oriented grains to airborne contamination of the h-BN flakes. We show
that single-crystal grains with six-fold symmetry can be obtained by adopting
high hydrogen partial pressures during growth. Notably, growth rates as high as
100 nm/min are obtained by optimizing growth temperature and pressure. The
possibility of synthesizing single-crystal graphene on h-BN with appreciable
growth rates by adopting a simple CVD approach is a step towards an increased
accessibility of this promising van der Waals heterostructure.

greater accuracy and sensitivity than what is currently available. An important
aspect to consider is temporal stellar atmospheric disturbances that can
influence the planetary composition, and hence spectra, and potentially can
lead to incorrect assumptions about the steady-state atmospheric composition of
the planet. We focus on perturbations that come from the host star in the form
of flare events that significantly increase the photon flux impingement on the
exoplanet atmosphere. In some cases, and particularly for M stars, this sudden
increase may last for several hours. We aim at answering the question to what
extent a stellar flare is able to modify the chemical composition of the
planetary atmosphere and, therefore influence the resulting spectra. We use a
1D thermo-photochemical model to study the neutral atmospheric composition of
two hypothetic planets located around the star AD Leo. This active star has
already been observed during a flare. We use the spectroscopic data from this
flare event to simulate the evolution of the chemical composition of the
atmospheres of the two hypothetic planets. We compute synthetic spectra to
evaluate the implications for observations. The increase of the incoming photon
flux affects the chemical abundances of some important species down to
altitudes associated with an atmospheric pressure of 1 bar, that can lead to
variations in planetary spectra if performed during transit.

have developed powerful theories of hypergraph containers. These theories have
led to a large number of new results on transference, and on counting and
characterising typical graphs in hereditary properties. In a different
direction, Hatami--Janson--Szegedy proved results on the entropy of graph
limits which count and characterise graphs in dense hereditary properties.
  In this paper, we make a threefold contribution to this area of research:
  1) We generalise results of Saxton--Thomason to obtain container theorems for
general, dense hereditary properties of multicoloured graphs. Our main tool is
the adoption of an entropy-based framework. As corollaries, we obtain general
counting, characterization and transference results. We further extend our
results to cover a variety of combinatorial structures: directed graphs,
oriented graphs, tournaments, multipartite graphs, multi-graphs, hypercubes and
hypergraphs.
  2) We generalise the results of Hatami--Janson--Szegedy on the entropy of
graph limits to the setting of decorated graph limits. In particular we define
a cut norm for decorated graph limits and prove compactness of the space of
decorated graph limits under that norm.
  3) We explore a weak equivalence between the container and graph limit
approaches to counting and characterising graphs in hereditary properties. In
one direction, we show how our multicolour container results may be used to
recover decorated versions of the results of Hatami--Janson--Szegedy. In the
other direction, we show that our decorated extensions of
Hatami--Janson--Szegedy's results on graph limits imply counting and
characterization applications.

equilibrium slowly after they adsorb to a liquid-liquid interface, despite the
large interfacial energy gradient driving the adsorption. The slow relaxation
has been explained in terms of transient pinning and depinning of the contact
line on the surface of the particles. However, the nature of the pinning sites
has not been investigated in detail. We use digital holographic microscopy to
track a variety of colloidal spheres---inorganic and organic, charge-stabilized
and sterically stabilized, aqueous and non-aqueous---as they breach liquid
interfaces. We find that nearly all of these particles relax logarithmically in
time over timescales much larger than those expected from viscous dissipation
alone. By comparing our results to theoretical models of the pinning dynamics,
we infer the area per defect to be on the order of a few square nanometers for
each of the colloids we examine, whereas the energy per defect can vary from a
few $kT$ for non-aqueous and inorganic spheres to tens of $kT$ for aqueous
polymer particles. The results suggest that the likely pinning sites are
topographical features inherent to colloidal particles---surface roughness in
the case of silica particles and grafted polymer ""hairs"" in the case of polymer
particles. We conclude that the slow relaxation must be taken into account in
experiments and applications, such as Pickering emulsions, that involve
colloids attaching to interfaces. The effect is particularly important for
aqueous polymer particles, which pin the contact line strongly.

analysis of the disks themselves. Currently, the number of chemical elements

respect to $\vec{B}$. As a byproduct, we provide continuum limit extrapolated
results for the string tension, the Coulomb coupling and the Sommer parameter
at $T = 0$ and $B = 0$. We confirm the presence in the continuum of a
$B$-induced anisotropy, regarding essentially the string tension, for which it
is of the order of 15\% at $|e| B \sim 1~{\rm GeV}^2$ and would suggest, if
extrapolated to larger fields, a vanishing string tension along the magnetic
field for $|e| B \gtrsim 4$ GeV$^2$. The angular dependence for $|e| B \lesssim
1$ GeV$^2$ can be nicely parametrized by the first allowed term in an angular
Fourier expansion, corresponding to a quadrupole deformation. Finally, for $T
\neq 0$, the main effect of the magnetic field is a general suppression of the
string tension, leading to a precocious loss of the confining properties: this
happens even before the appearance of inverse magnetic catalysis in the chiral
condensate, supporting the idea that the influence of the magnetic field on the
confining properties is the leading effect originating the decrease of $T_c$ as
a function of $B$.

them readily identifiable as unrelated to the solar system. Moro-Mart\'in et
al. 2009 have made a detailed and reasonable estimate of the properties of the

a numerical model that allows us to consider ""close"" interstellar comets, e.g.,
those that come within the orbit of Jupiter. We include several constraints on
a ""detectable"" object that allow for realistic estimates of the frequency of
detections expected from the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST) and other
surveys. The influence of several of the assumed model parameters on the
frequency of detections is explored in detail. Based on the expectation from
Moro-Mart\'in et al. 2009, we expect that LSST will detect 0.001-10
interstellar comets during its nominal 10-year lifetime, with most of the
uncertainty from the unknown number density of small (nuclei of $\sim$0.1-1 km)
interstellar comets. Using simulated LSST-like astrometric data, we study the
problem of orbit determination for these bodies, finding that LSST could
identify their orbits as hyperbolic and determine an ephemeris sufficiently
accurate for follow-up in about 4-7 days. We give the hyperbolic orbital
parameters of the most detectable interstellar comets. Taking the results into

enable images to be recorded using a single detector that measures the
correlations between the scene and a set of patterns. However, to fully sample
a scene in this way requires at least the same number of correlation
measurements as there are pixels in the reconstructed image. Therefore
single-pixel imaging systems typically exhibit low frame-rates. To mitigate
this, a range of compressive sensing techniques have been developed which rely
on a priori knowledge of the scene to reconstruct images from an under-sampled
set of measurements. In this work we take a different approach and adopt a
strategy inspired by the foveated vision systems found in the animal kingdom -
a framework that exploits the spatio-temporal redundancy present in many
dynamic scenes. In our single-pixel imaging system a high-resolution foveal
region follows motion within the scene, but unlike a simple zoom, every frame
delivers new spatial information from across the entire field-of-view. Using
this approach we demonstrate a four-fold reduction in the time taken to record
the detail of rapidly evolving features, whilst simultaneously accumulating
detail of more slowly evolving regions over several consecutive frames. This
tiered super-sampling technique enables the reconstruction of video streams in
which both the resolution and the effective exposure-time spatially vary and
adapt dynamically in response to the evolution of the scene. The methods
described here can complement existing compressive sensing approaches and may
be applied to enhance a variety of computational imagers that rely on
sequential correlation measurements.

optimization problem in which the relaxation times $\tau_{\omega}= \tau

relaxation traces and solutions of the Boltzmann transport equation (BTE) for

very efficient, or numerical. The proposed method is illustrated using Monte

a semi-classic wave packages of electrons in this paper. A strong magnetic
field perpendicular to a slab separates the electron current into two branches
with opposite wave vectors $({\it k})$ and locating at the two edges of the
slab, respectively, along the current. In this case back scattering of
electrons ($k\rightarrow -k$) is prohibited by the separation of electron
currents. Thus the slab exhibits zero longitudinal resistance and plateaus of
Hall resistance. When the Fermi level is scanning over a Landau level when the
magnetic field increases, however, the electron waves locate around the central
axis of the slab and overlap each other thus back scattering of electrons takes
place frequently. Then longitudinal resistance appears and the Hall resistance
goes up from one plateau to a new plateau.

  network architecture of the human skull","15 pages, 2 figures",,,,"q-bio.TO q-bio.QM","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The premature fusion of cranial bones, craniosynostosis, affects the correct
development of the skull producing morphological malformations in newborns. To
assess the susceptibility of each craniofacial articulation to close
prematurely, we used a network model of the skull to quantify the link
reliability (an index based on stochastic block modeling and Bayesian
inference) of each articulation. We show that, of the 93 human skull
articulations at birth, the few articulations that are associated with
nonsyndromic craniosynostosis conditions have statistically significant lower
reliability scores than the others. In a similar way, articulations that close
during the normal postnatal development of the skull have also lower
reliability scores than those articulations that persist through adult live.
These results indicate a relationship between the architecture of the skull
network and the specific articulations that close during normal development and
in pathological conditions. Our findings suggest that the topological
arrangement of skull bones might act as an epigenetic factor, predisposing some
articulations to closure, both in normal and pathological development, and also
affecting the long-term evolution of the skull.

These layers are often implemented using de-coupled solutions with millions of
lines of code. Programmers often have to track and debug a function call from
user interface layer to the data access layer while troubleshooting an issue.
They have to inspect the code based on search results or use design documents
to construct the call graph. This process is time consuming and laborious. The
development environment tools are insufficient or confined to analyzing only
the code in the loaded solution. This paper proposes a method to construct a
call graph of the call across several layers of the code residing in different
code bases to help programmers better understand the design and architecture of
the software. The signatures of class, methods, and properties were evaluated
and then matched against the code files. A graph of matching functions was
created. The recursive search stopped when there were no matches or the data
layer code was detected. The method resulted in 78.26% accuracy when compared
with manual search.

(warped) internal, six dimensional, almost-K\""ahler manifolds $\ ^6\mathbf{X}$
are studied. Considering ten dimensional spacetimes with nonholonomic
distributions and conventional double fibrations, 2+2+...=2+2+3+3, and
associated $SU(3)$ structures on internal space, we generalize for real,
internal, almost symplectic gravitational structures the constructions with
gravitational and gauge instantons of tanh-kink type. They include the first
$\alpha ^{\prime}$ corrections to the heterotic supergravity action,
parameterized in a form to imply nonholonomic deformations of the Yang-Mills
sector and corresponding Bianchi identities. We show how it is possible to
construct a variety of solutions depending on the type of nonholonomic
distributions and deformations of 'prime' instanton configurations
characterized by two real supercharges. This corresponds to $\mathcal{N}=1/2$
supersymmetric, nonholonomic manifolds from the four dimensional point of view.
Our method provides a unified description of embedding nonholonomically
deformed tanh-kink-type instantons into half-BPS solutions of heterotic
supergravity. This allows us to elaborate new geometric methods of constructing
exact solutions of motion equations, with first order $\alpha ^{\prime}$
corrections to the heterotic supergravity. Such a formalism is applied for
general and/or warped almost-K\""ahler configurations, which allows us to
generate nontrivial (1+3)-d domain walls and black hole deformations determined
by quasiperiodic internal space structures. This formalism is utilized in our
associated publication [EPJC 77 (2017) 17, arXiv: 1608.01980] in order to
construct and study generic off-diagonal nonholonomic deformations of the Kerr
metric, encoding contributions from heterotic supergravity.
