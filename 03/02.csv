over a commutative noetherian ring $R$ of positive prime characteristic. The
first is the category of modules of finite $F$-type. These objects include
reflexive ideals representing torsion elements in the divisor class group of
$R$. The second class is what we call $F$-abundant modules. These include, for
example, the ring $R$ itself and the canonical module when $R$ has positive
splitting dimension. We prove various facts about these two categories and how
they are related, for example that $\mathrm{Hom}_R(M,N)$ is maximal
Cohen-Macaulay when $M$ is of finite $F$-type and $N$ is $F$-abundant, plus
some extra (but necessary) conditions. Our methods allow us to extend previous
results by Patakfalvi-Schwede, Yao and Watanabe. They also afford a deeper
understanding of these objects, including complete classifications in many
cases of interest, such as complete intersections and invariant subrings.

shock-wave in the supernova community. The three possible mechanisms proposed
for the majority of other superluminous supernovae do not produce a realistic
physical model for this particular supernova. In the present study we show the
limiting luminosity available from a nickel-powered pair-instability supernova.
We computed a few exotic nickel-powered explosions with a total mass of nickel
up to 1500 solar masses. We used the hydrostatic configurations prepared with
the GENEVA and MESA codes, and the STELLA radiative-transfer code for following
the explosion of these models. We show that 1500 solar masses of radioactive
nickel is needed to power a luminosity of 2x10^45 erg/s. The resulting light
curve is very broad and incompatible with the shorter ASASSN-15lh time-scale.
This rules out a nickel-powered origin of ASASSN-15lh. In addition, we derive a
simple peak luminosity - nickel mass relation from our data, which may serve to
estimate of nickel mass from observed peak luminosities.

different topological index, very much like the interface between two
insulators of different topology is necessarily conducting. The topological
numbers characterizing such gapped states are given by superconducting phase
windings over the two loops forming the Josephson interferometer. Since these

between two concentric cylinders. In order to take into account the thixotropy,
the constitutive relation uses a structural parameter which is driven by a
kinetic equation. Here, the Houska's model is considered. Depending on the
breakdown rate of the structural parameter, localization or shear-banding are
observed. We show that for fragile structures, a shear-banding flow may be
observed although for stronger structures, only localisation of the flow is
observed such as in Bingham fluids. Physical explanations of the shear-banding
discussed by several authors in the literature highlight that the shear-banding
may be associated with a discontinuity into the structure of the material and a
non-monotonic evolution of the stress according to the constitutive relation
with the strain rate. Solving numerically the flow, we show that such a
rheological model based on the existence of a structural parameter is able to
predict shear-banding. Moreover, the consequences of the thixotropy on the
linear stability of the azimuthal flow is studied in a large range of
parameters. Although the thixotropy allows shear banding for the base flow, it
does not modify fundamentaly the stability of the Couette flow compared to a
simple yield stress fluid. The apparent shear-thinning behaviour depends on the
thixotropic parameters of the fluid and the results about the onset of the
Taylor vortices in shear-thinning fluids are retrieved. Nevertheless, the
shear-banding modifies the stratification of the viscosity in the flowing zone
such that the critical conditions are mainly driven by the width of the flowing
region.

(LV) systems both in pull-back trajectory and in stationary measure. It is
proved stochastic decomposition formula describing the relation between
solutions of stochastic and deterministic LV systems and stochastic Logistic
equation. By virtue of this formula, it is verified that every pull-back omega
limit set is an omega limit set for deterministic LV systems multiplied by the
random equilibrium of the stochastic Logistic equation. This formula is used to
derive the existence of a stationary measure, its support and ergodicity. We
prove the tightness for the set of stationary measures and the invariance for
their weak limits as the noise intensity vanishes, whose supports are contained
in the Birkhoff center.
  The developed theory is successfully utilized to completely classify three
dimensional competitive stochastic LV systems into $37$ classes. Time average
probability measures weakly converge to an ergodic stationary measure on the
attracting domain of an omega limit set in all classes except class 27 c).
Among them there are two classes possessing a continuum of random closed orbits
and ergodic stationary measures supported in cone surfaces, which weakly
converge to the Haar measures of periodic orbits as the noise intensity
vanishes. In the exceptional class, almost every pull-back trajectory
cyclically oscillates around the boundary of the stochastic carrying simplex
characterized by three unstable stationary solutions. The limit for the time
average probability measures is neither unique nor ergodic. These are subject

magnetized jets that carry no net electric current and do not have current
sheets. In this paper, in addition to physically well-motivated magnetic field
structures, we also include the effects of jet shear. The jets we study have
finite thermal pressure in addition to having realistic magnetic field
structures and velocity shear. We find that shear has a strongly stabilizing
effect on various modes of jet instability. Increasing shear stabilizes the
fundamental pinch modes at long wavelengths and short wavelengths. Increasing
shear also stabilizes the first reflection pinch modes at short wavelengths.
Increasing shear has only a very modest stabilizing effect on the fundamental
kink modes at long wavelengths; however, increasing shear does have a strong
stabilizing effect on the fundamental kink modes at short wavelengths. The
first reflection kink modes are strongly stabilized by increasing shear at
shorter wavelengths. Overall, we find that the combined effect of magnetic
field and shear stabilizes jets more than shear alone. In addition to the
results from a formal linear stability analysis, we present a novel way of
visualizing and understanding jet stability. This gives us a deeper
understanding of the enhanced stability of sheared, magnetized jets. We also
emphasize the value of our numerical approach in understanding the linear

treated that way at the same time.

halo could have been the result of the assemblage of smaller structures. Here
we explore the hypothesis that the classical and ultra-faint dwarf spheroidal
satellites of the Milky Way have been the building blocks of the Galactic halo
by comparing their [$\alpha$/Fe] and [Ba/Fe] versus [Fe/H] patterns with the
ones observed in Galactic halo stars. The $\alpha$ elements deviate
substantially from the observed abundances in the Galactic halo stars for
[Fe/H] values larger than -2 dex, while they overlap for lower metallicities.
On the other hand, for the [Ba/Fe] ratio the discrepancy is extended at all
[Fe/H] values, suggesting that the majority of stars in the halo are likely to
have been formed in situ. Therefore, we suggest that [Ba/Fe] ratios are a
better diagnostic than [$\alpha$/Fe] ratios. Moreover, for the first time we
consider the effects of an enriched infall of gas with the same chemical
abundances as the matter ejected and/or stripped from dwarf satellites of the
Milky Way on the chemical evolution of the Galactic halo. We find that the
resulting chemical abundances of the halo stars depend on the assumed infall
time scale, and the presence of a threshold in the gas for star formation. In
particular, in models with an infall timescale for the halo around 0.8 Gyr
coupled with a threshold in the surface gas density for the star formation (4
$\mathrm{M}_{\odot}\,\mathrm{pc}^{-2}$), and the enriched infall from dwarf
spheroidal satellites, the first halo stars formed show [Fe/H]$>$-2.4 dex. In
this case, to explain [$\alpha$/Fe] data for stars with [Fe/H]$<$-2.4 dex we
need stars formed in dSph systems.

can exchange virtual photons with a nearby surface. The resulting dispersion
interaction between a purely magnetic object (neutron) and a purely electric

necessity of the classical can be seen as part of his response to the
measurement problem. More generally, I attempt to clarify Bohr's view on the
classical/quantum divide, arguing that the relation between the two theories is
that of mutual dependence. An important element in this clarification consists
in distinguishing Bohr's idea of the wave function as symbolic from both a
purely epistemic and an ontological interpretation. Together with new evidence
concerning Bohr's conception of the wave function collapse, this sets his
interpretation apart from both standard versions of the Copenhagen
interpretation, and from some of the reconstructions of his view found in the

Cu(pyz)$_2$(ClO$_4$)$_2$. We find that, within the limits of the experimental
error, the two-dimensional, {\it intralayer} exchange coupling in our family of
materials remains largely unaffected by the axial ligand substitution, while
the observed magnetic ordering temperature decreases slowly with increasing
layer separation. Despite the structural motifs common to this family and
Cu(pyz)$_2$(ClO$_4$)$_2$, the latter has significantly stronger two-dimensional
exchange interactions and hence a higher ordering temperature. We discuss these
results, as well as the mechanisms that might drive the long-range order in
these materials, in terms of departures from the ideal $S=1/2$ two-dimensional
square-lattice Heisenberg antiferromagnet. In particular, we find that both
spin exchange anisotropy in the intralayer interaction and interlayer couplings
(exchange, dipolar, or both) are needed to account for the observed ordering
temperatures, with the intralayer anisotropy becoming more important as the
layers are pulled further apart.

Wiener chaos converges to a normal law if and only if its fourth cumulant
converges to $0$. The bounds show that the speed of convergence is precisely of
order the maximum of the fourth cumulant and the absolute value of the third
moment (cumulant). Specializing to the case of normalized centered quadratic
variations for stationary Gaussian sequences, we show that a third moment
theorem holds: convergence occurs if and only if the sequence's third moments
tend to $0$. This is proved for sequences with general decreasing covariance,
by using the result of (Nourdin and Peccati, 2015), and finding the exact speed
of convergence to $0$ of the quadratic variation's third and fourth cumulants.
(Nourdin and Peccati, 2015) also allows us to derive quantitative estimates for

which puts in perspective the notion of critical Hurst parameter when studying
the convergence of fractional Brownian motion's quadratic variation. We also
study the speed of convergence when the limit is not Gaussian but rather a

recover a classical result of Dobrushin-Major/Taqqu whereby the limit is a

solar system solids in low velocity impact events, using the iSALE shock

porous matrix. By simulating impacts into bimodal mixtures over a wide range of
parameter space (including the chondrule-to-matrix ratio, the matrix porosity
and composition and the impact velocity), we have shown how each of these
parameters influences the shock processing of heterogeneous materials. The
temperature after shock processing shows a strong dichotomy: matrix
temperatures are elevated much higher than the chondrules, which remain largely
cold. Chondrules can protect some matrix from shock compaction, with shadow
regions in the lee side of chondrules exhibiting higher porosity that elsewhere
in the matrix. Using the results from this mesoscale modelling, we show how the
$\varepsilon-\alpha$ porous compaction model parameters depend on initial bulk
porosity. We also show that the timescale for the temperature dichotomy to
equilibrate is highly dependent on the porosity of the matrix after the shock,
and will be on the order of seconds for matrix porosities of less than 0.1, and
on the order of 10's to 100's seconds for matrix porosities of $\sim$ 0.3--0.5.
Finally, we have shown that the composition of the post-shock material is able

spectral peak and a series of absorption lines which have been identified as
OII. SN2011kl, associated with the ultra-long gamma-ray burst GRB111209A, also
had a blue peak but a featureless optical/UV spectrum. Radiation transport
methods are used to show that the spectra (not including SN2007bi, which has a
redder spectrum at peak, like ordinary SNe Ic) can be explained by a rather
steep density distribution of the ejecta, whose composition appears to be
typical of carbon-oxygen cores of massive stars which can have low metal
content. If the photospheric velocity is ~10000-15000 km/s, several lines form
in the UV. OII lines, however, arise from very highly excited lower levels,
which require significant departures from Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium to be
populated. These SLSNe are not thought to be powered primarily by 56Ni decay.
An appealing scenario is that they are energised by X-rays from the shock
driven by a magnetar wind into the SN ejecta. The apparent lack of evolution of
line velocity with time that characterises SLSNe up to about maximum is another
argument in favour of the magnetar scenario. The smooth UV continuum of
SN2011kl requires higher ejecta velocities (~20000 km/s): line blanketing leads
to an almost featureless spectrum. Helium is observed in some SLSNe after
maximum. The high ionization near maximum implies that both He and H may be
present but not observed at early times. The spectroscopic classification of
SLSNe should probably reflect that of SNe Ib/c. Extensive time coverage is
required for an accurate classification.

process of Roche-lobe overflow (RLO). Moreover, orbital stability analysis
shows tides can drive many hot Jupiters to spiral inevitably toward their host
stars. Thus, the coupled processes of orbital evolution and RLO likely shape
the observed distribution of close-in exoplanets and may even be responsible
for producing some of the short-period rocky planets. However, the exact
outcome for an overflowing planet depends on its internal response to mass
loss, and the accompanying orbital evolution can act to enhance or inhibit RLO.
In this study, we apply the fully-featured and robust Modules for Experiments
in Stellar Astrophysics (MESA) suite to model RLO of short-period gaseous
planets. We show that, although the detailed evolution may depend on several
properties of the planetary system, it is largely determined by the core mass
of the overflowing gas giant. In particular, we find that the orbital expansion
that accompanies RLO often stops and reverses at a specific maximum period that
depends on the core mass. We suggest that RLO may often strand the remnant of a
gas giant near this orbital period, which provides an observational prediction
that can corroborate the hypothesis that short-period gas giants undergo RLO.
We conduct a preliminary comparison of this prediction to the observed
population of small, short-period planets and find some planets in orbits that
may be consistent with this picture. To the extent that we can establish some
short-period planets are indeed the remnants of gas giants, that population can
elucidate the properties of gas giant cores, the properties of which remain
largely unconstrained.

of the magnetic field locally, when the local current exceeds a Critical
threshold, is a key process which drives avalanches and forms coherent

phases. We show that anharmonicity-controlled fluctuations of a graphene
membrane around equilibrium flat phase lead to unusual elastic properties. In
particular, we demonstrate that stretching $\xi$ of a flake of graphene is a
nonlinear function of the applied tension at small tension:
${\xi\propto\sigma^{\eta/(2-\eta)}}$ and ${\xi\propto\sigma^{\eta/(8-\eta)}}$
for clean and strongly disordered graphene, respectively. Conventional linear
Hooke's law, ${\xi\propto\sigma}$ is realized at sufficiently large tensions:
${\sigma\gg\sigma_*},$ where $\sigma_*$ depends both on temperature and on the
disorder strength.

multi-objective query optimization. The goal is to find the set of Pareto plans
realizing optimal cost tradeoffs for a given query. So far, only algorithms
with exponential complexity in the number of query tables have been proposed
for multi-objective query optimization. In this work, we present the first
algorithm with polynomial complexity in the query size.
  Our algorithm is randomized and iterative. It improves query plans via a
multi-objective version of hill climbing that applies multiple transformations
in each climbing step for maximal efficiency. Based on a locally optimal plan,
we approximate the Pareto plan set within the restricted space of plans with
similar join orders. We maintain a cache of Pareto-optimal plans for each
potentially useful intermediate result to share partial plans that were
discovered in different iterations. We show that each iteration of our
algorithm performs in expected polynomial time based on an analysis of the
expected path length between a random plan and local optima reached by hill
climbing. We experimentally show that our algorithm can optimize queries with
hundreds of tables and outperforms other randomized algorithms such as the
NSGA-II genetic algorithm over a wide range of scenarios.

challenging endeavor. Many parameters need to be optimized to achieve
high-fidelity operations. This can be done efficiently for operations acting on
single qubits as errors can be fully characterized. For multi-qubit operations,
though, this is no longer the case as in the most general case analyzing the
effect of the operation on the system requires a full state tomography for
which resources scale exponentially with the system size. Furthermore, in
recent experiments additional electronic levels beyond the two-level system
encoding the qubit have been used to enhance the capabilities of quantum
information processors, which additionally increases the number of parameters
that need to be controlled. For the optimization of the experimental system for
a given task (e.g.~a quantum algorithm), one has to find a satisfactory error
model and also efficient observables to estimate the parameters of the model.
In this manuscript we demonstrate a method to optimize the encoding procedure
for a small quantum error correction code in the presence of unknown but
constant phase shifts. The method, which we implement here on a small-scale
linear ion-trap quantum computer, is readily applicable to other AMO platforms
for quantum information processing.

This scheme is apt for energy and power scaling because the stability region of
this multi-pass resonator contrarily to the 4f-based schemes does not shrink
with the number of passes. Simulation of the eigen-mode of this multi-segment
resonator requires considering aperture effects. This has been achieved by
implementing effective Gaussian apertures into the ABCD-matrix formalism as
lenses with imaginary focal length. We conclude proposing a simple way to
double the stability region of the state-of-the-art layouts used in industry

same IP-address. A popular architecture for modern Content Distribution
Networks (CDNs) for geo-replicated services consists of multiple layers of
proxy nodes for service and co-located DNS-servers for load-balancing among
different proxies. Both the proxies and the DNS-servers use anycast addressing,
which offers simplicity of design and high availability of service at the cost
of partial loss of routing control. Due to the very nature of anycast,
redirection actions by a DNS-server also affects loads at nearby proxies in the
network. This makes the problem of optimal distributed load management highly
challenging. In this paper, we propose and evaluate an analytical framework to
formulate and solve the load-management problem in this context. We consider
two distinct algorithms. In the first half of the paper, we pose the
load-management problem as a convex optimization problem. Following a
Kelly-type dual decomposition technique, we propose a fully-distributed
load-management algorithm by introducing FastControl packets. This algorithm
utilizes the underlying anycast mechanism itself to enable effective
coordination among the nodes, thus obviating the need for any external control
channel. In the second half of the paper, we consider an alternative greedy
load-management heuristic, currently in production in a major commercial CDN.
We study its dynamical characteristics and analytically identify its
operational and stability properties. Finally, we critically evaluate both the
algorithms and explore their optimality-vs-complexity trade-off using
trace-driven simulations.

accomplished via tight phase locking of two mode-locked lasers or via
sophisticated signal processing algorithms, and therefore, long integration
times of phase coherent signals are difficult to achieve. Here we demonstrate
an alternative approach to dual-comb spectroscopy using two phase modulator
combs originating from a single continuous-wave laser capable of > 2 hours of

phase modulators with step-recovery diodes where each comb consisted of > 250

The step-recovery diodes are passive devices that provide low-phase-noise
harmonics for efficient coupling into an enhancement cavity at picowatt optical
powers. With this approach, we demonstrate the sensitivity to simultaneously
monitor ambient levels of CO2, CO, HDO, and H2O in a single spectral region at
a maximum acquisition rate of 150 kHz. Robust, compact, low-cost and widely
tunable dual-comb systems could enable a network of distributed multiplexed

terms of high-eccentricity migration of planets that arrive in the vicinity of

dispersal of their natal disk. We demonstrate that the two distinct segments of
the boundary are a direct consequence of the different slopes of the empirical
mass--radius relation for small and large planets, and show that this relation
also fixes the mass coordinate of the intersection point. The period coordinate
of this point, as well as the detailed shape of the lower boundary, can be
reproduced with a plausible choice of a key parameter in the underlying
migration model. The detailed shape of the upper boundary, on the other hand,
is determined by the post-circularization tidal exchange of angular momentum
with the star and can be reproduced with a stellar tidal quality factor
$Q^\prime_*\sim10^6$.

for many stellar properties, but its members are also scattered widely over the

observations of single stars or data from shallower all-sky variability
surveys. The re-purposed Kepler mission, K2, is the first opportunity to
measure rotation periods ($P_{rot}$) for many Hyads simultaneously while also
being sensitive to fully convective M dwarf members. We analyze K2 data for 65
Hyads and present $P_{rot}$ values for 48. Thirty-seven of these are new
measurements, including the first $P_{rot}$ measurements for fully convective
Hyads. For nine of the 11 stars with $P_{rot}$ in the literature and this work,
the measurements are consistent; we attribute the two discrepant cases to spot
evolution. Nearly all stars with masses $\le0.3M_\odot$ are rapidly rotating,
indicating a change in rotation properties at the boundary to full convection.
When confirmed and candidate binaries are removed from the mass-period plane,
only three rapid rotators with masses $\ge0.3M_\odot$ remain. This is in
contrast to previous results showing that the single-valued mass-period
sequence for $\approx$600 Myr-old stars ends at $\approx0.65M_\odot$ when
binaries are included. We also find that models of rotational evolution predict
faster rotation than is actually observed at $\approx$600 Myrs for stars
$\le0.9M_\odot$. The dearth of single rapid rotators more massive than
$\approx0.3M_\odot$ indicates that magnetic braking is more efficient than
previously thought, and that age-rotation studies must account for
multiplicity.

macroscopic rheology becomes increasingly controlled by the microscopic details
of short ranged particle interactions in the shear thickening regime. Our
measurements here of the first normal stress difference over a wide range of
particle volume fraction elucidate the relative contributions from hydrodynamic
lubrication and frictional contact forces, which have been debated. At moderate
volume fractions we find $N_1<0$, consistent with hydrodynamic models, however
at higher volume fractions and shear stresses these models break down and we
instead observe dilation ($N_1>0$), indicating frictional contact networks.
Remarkably, there is no signature of this transition in the viscosity, instead
this change in the sign of $N_1$ occurs while the shear thickening remains
continuous. These results suggest a scenario where shear thickening is driven
primarily by the formation of frictional contacts, with hydrodynamic forces
playing a supporting role at lower concentrations. Motivated by this picture,
we introduce a simple model which combines these frictional and hydrodynamic
contributions and accurately fits the measured viscosity over a wide range of
particle volume fraction and shear stress.

recursive long short term memory networks (RLSTM) are models that compute
representations for sentences, by recursively combining word embeddings

recurrent networks, explicitly make use of the hierarchical structure of a
sentence. In this paper, we demonstrate that RNNs nevertheless suffer from the
vanishing gradient and long distance dependency problem, and that RLSTMs
greatly improve over RNN's on these problems. We present an artificial learning
task that allows us to quantify the severity of these problems for both models.
We further show that a ratio of gradients (at the root node and a focal leaf
node) is highly indicative of the success of backpropagation at optimizing the
relevant weights low in the tree. This paper thus provides an explanation for
existing, superior results of RLSTMs on tasks such as sentiment analysis, and

Alexa most popular websites. In this study, we collect GitHub's state in its
entirety. Doing so, allows us to study new aspects of the ecosystem. Although
GitHub is the home to millions of users and repositories, the analysis of
users' activity time-series reveals that only around 10% of them can be
considered active. The collected dataset allows us to investigate the
popularity of programming languages and existence of pattens in the relations
between users, repositories, and programming languages.
  By, applying a k-means clustering method to the users-repositories commits
matrix, we find that two clear clusters of programming languages separate from
the remaining. One cluster forms for ""web programming"" languages (Java Script,
Ruby, PHP, CSS), and a second for ""system oriented programming"" languages (C,
C++, Python). Further classification, allow us to build a phylogenetic tree of
the use of programming languages in GitHub. Additionally, we study the main and
the auxiliary programming languages of the top 1000 repositories in more

the computational load of these methods remains a challenge in large scale

criterion, which sets the largest value allowed for correlations between the

proposed BS approach is equivalent to solving a maximum clique problem (MCP),

objects, but until recently, our knowledge of the relation between the
free-free radio emission and the IR emission has been observationally hindered
by the limited angular resolution in the far-IR. The advent of Herschel has now
made it possible to obtain a more precise comparison between the two regimes,
and it has been found that about a third of the young HII regions emit more
Lyman continuum photons than expected, thus presenting a Lyman excess. With the
present study we wish to distinguish between two scenarios that have been
proposed to explain the existence of the Lyman excess: (i) underestimation of
the bolometric luminosity, or (ii) additional emission of Lyman-continuum
photons from an accretion shock. We observed an outflow (SiO) and an infall
(HCO+) tracer toward a complete sample of 200 HII regions, 67 of which present
the Lyman excess. Our goal was to search for any systematic difference between
sources with Lyman excess and those without. While the outflow tracer does not
reveal any significant difference between the two subsamples of HII regions,
the infall tracer indicates that the Lyman-excess sources are more associated
with infall signposts than the other objects. Our findings indicate that the
most plausible explanation for the Lyman excess is that in addition to the
Lyman continuum emission from the early-type star, UV photons are emitted from
accretion shocks in the stellar neighbourhood. This result suggests that
high-mass stars and/or stellar clusters containing young massive stars may
continue to accrete for a long time, even after the development of a compact
HII region.

space of the two SOC parameters $ ( \alpha, \beta) $ in a square lattice. In
the strong coupling limit, it leads to a new quantum spin model called Rotated
Ferromagnetic Heisenberg model (RFHM). The RFHM leads to rich and
unconventional magnetic phases even in a bipartite lattice. For the first
class, by identifying a suitable low energy mode, we investigate a new quantum
Lifshitz transition from the Y-x to the IC-SkX-y phase. For the second class,
we introduce the topological rational and irrational winding numbers $ W $ to
characterize the incomplete or complete devil staircases and also perform their
quantizations. The IC-YZ-x/LQx phases form a Cantor set with a fractal
dimension along the complete devil staircase. They also take most of measures
in the incomplete devil staircases when $ \beta \ll \alpha $. Quantum chaos and
quantum information scramblings along the diagonal line $ \alpha=\beta $ are
discussed. Implications on un-conventional magnetic ordered phases detected in
the 4d- or 5d-orbital strongly correlated materials with SOC and in the current
or near future cold atom systems are presented.

J141711.07+522540.8 (z=0.41827, d_L=2.3 Gpc) in the Extended Groth Strip. It is
located at a projected offset of ~1.0 (5.2 kpc) from the nucleus of the galaxy
and was serendipitously detected in five XMM-Newton observations in 2000 July.
Two observations have enough counts and can be fitted with a standard thermal
disk with an apparent inner disk temperature kT_MCD ~ 0.13 keV and a 0.28-14.2
keV unabsorbed luminosity L_X ~ 4X10^{43} erg/s in the source rest frame. The
source was still detected in three Chandra observations in 2002 August, with
similarily ultrasoft but fainter spectra (kT_MCD ~ 0.17 keV, L_X ~ 0.5X10^{43}

2005 October, one by XMM-Newton in 2014 January, and two by Chandra in 2014
September-October, implying a long-term flux variation factor of >14. Therefore
the source could be a transient with an outburst in 2000-2002. It has a faint
optical counterpart candidate, with apparent magnitudes of m_F606W=26.3 AB mag
and m_F814W=25.5 AB mag in 2004 December (implying an absolute V-band magnitude
of ~-15.9 AB mag). We discuss various explanations for the source and find that
it is best explained as a massive black hole (BH) embedded in the nucleus of a
possibly stripped satellite galaxy, with the X-ray outburst due to tidal
disruption of a surrounding star by the BH. The BH mass is ~10^5 Msun, assuming
the peak X-ray luminosity at around the Eddington limit.

vs. (O/H) abundance pattern of star forming galaxies in the Local Universe. We
derive gas-phase abundances from SDSS spectroscopy and a complementary sample
of low-metallicity dwarf galaxies, making use of a consistent set of abundance
calibrations. This collection of data clearly confirms the existence of a
plateau in the (N/O) ratio at very low metallicity, followed by an increase of
this ratio up to high values as the metallicity increases. This trend can be
interpreted as due to two main sources of nitrogen in galaxies: i) massive
stars, which produce small amounts of pure primary nitrogen and are responsible
for the (N/O) ratio in the low metallicity plateau; ii) low- and
intermediate-mass stars, which produce both secondary and primary nitrogen and
enrich the interstellar medium with a time delay relative to massive stars, and
cause the increase of the (N/O) ratio. We find that the length of the
low-metallicity plateau is almost solely determined by the star formation
efficiency, which regulates the rate of oxygen production by massive stars. We
show that, to reproduce the high observed (N/O) ratios at high (O/H), as well
as the right slope of the (N/O) vs. (O/H) curve, a differential galactic wind -
where oxygen is assumed to be lost more easily than nitrogen - is necessary. No
existing set of stellar yields can reproduce the observed trend without
assuming differential galactic winds. Finally, considering the current best set
of stellar yields, a bottom-heavy initial mass function is favoured to
reproduce the data.

frontier by 150 Myr to well before the Planck (instantaneous) cosmic
reionization peak at z~8.8, demonstrating that galaxy build-up was well
underway early in the reionization epoch at z>10. GN-z11 is remarkably and

3x larger than L* measured at z~6-8. The Spitzer IRAC detections up to 4.5

the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) will be able to similarly and easily
confirm such sources at z>10 and characterize their physical properties through
detailed spectroscopy. Furthermore, WFIRST, with its wide-field near-IR
imaging, would find large numbers of similar galaxies and contribute greatly to
JWST's spectroscopy, if it is launched early enough to overlap with JWST.

correlates strongly with stellar mass, but also with environmental density.

of galaxies is set by the spin of the halo -- we recover both the abundance of
UDGs as a function of the host cluster mass and the distribution of sizes
within the UDG population. According to this model, UDGs are not failed $L_*$

for masses $20\,M_\odot \lesssim M_{\rm bh} \lesssim 100\, M_\odot$ where
primordial black holes (PBHs) may constitute the dark matter. If two BHs in a
galactic halo pass sufficiently close, they radiate enough energy in
gravitational waves to become gravitationally bound. The bound BHs will rapidly
spiral inward due to emission of gravitational radiation and ultimately merge.
Uncertainties in the rate for such events arise from our imprecise knowledge of
the phase-space structure of galactic halos on the smallest scales. Still,
reasonable estimates span a range that overlaps the $2-53$ Gpc$^{-3}$ yr$^{-1}$
rate estimated from GW150914, thus raising the possibility that LIGO has
detected PBH dark matter. PBH mergers are likely to be distributed spatially
more like dark matter than luminous matter and have no optical nor neutrino

traditional astrophysical sources through the observed mass spectrum, their
high ellipticities, or their stochastic gravitational wave background. Next

near-infrared channel of Wide Field Camera 3 (WFC3) on the Hubble Space
Telescope (HST). Wide-field near-IR surveys with HST are generally inefficient,
as guide star acquisitions make it impractical to observe more than one
pointing per orbit. This limitation can be circumvented by guiding with gyros
alone, which is possible as long as the telescope has three functional gyros.
The method presented here allows us to observe mosaics of eight independent
WFC3-IR pointings in a single orbit by utilizing the fact that HST drifts by
only a very small amount in the 25 seconds between non-destructive reads of
unguided exposures. By shifting the reads and treating them as independent
exposures the full resolution of WFC3 can be restored. We use this ""drift and
shift"" (DASH) method in the Cycle 23 COSMOS-DASH program, which will obtain 456
WFC3 $H_{160}$ pointings in 57 orbits, covering an area of 0.6 degree$^2$ in
the COSMOS field down to $H_{160} = 25$. When completed, the program will more
than triple the area of extra-galactic survey fields covered by near-IR imaging
at HST resolution. We demonstrate the viability of the method with the first
four orbits (32 pointings) of this program. We show that the resolution of the
WFC3 camera is preserved, and that structural parameters of galaxies are
consistent with those measured in guided observations.

magnetic fields to dynamically relevant strengths in core collapse supernovae
is still a matter of active scientific debate. Recent numerical studies have
shown that the first phase of MRI growth dominated by channel flows is
terminated by parasitic instabilities of the Kelvin-Helmholtz type that disrupt
MRI channel flows and quench further magnetic field growth. However, it remains
to be prop- erly assessed by what factor the initial magnetic field can be
amplified and how it depends on the initial field strength and the amplitude of
the perturbations. Different termination criteria leading to different
estimates of the amplification factor were proposed within the parasitic model.
To determine the amplification factor and test which criterion is a better
predictor of the MRI termination, we perform three-dimensional shearing-disc
and shearing-box simula- tions of a region close to the surface of a
differentially rotating proto-neutron star in non-ideal MHD with two different
numerical codes. We find that independently of the initial magnetic field
strength, the MRI channel modes can amplify the magnetic field by, at most, a
factor of 100. Under the conditions found in proto-neutron stars a more
realistic value for the mag- netic field amplification is of the order of 10.
This severely limits the role of the MRI channel modes as an agent amplifying
the magnetic field in proto-neutron stars starting from small seed fields. A
further amplification should therefore rely on other physical processes, such
as for example an MRI-driven turbulent dynamo.

We then generate spatially resolved stellar mass maps using an empirical
relationship between $M_{*}/L_{H_{160}}$ and $(z_{850}-H_{160})$ and use these
to derive mass-weighted S\'ersic fits: the mass-weighted sizes are ~41% smaller
than their rest-frame $r$-band counterparts compared with an average of ~12% at
z~0. We attribute this evolution to the evolution in the $M_{*}/L_{H_{160}}$
and colour gradient. Indeed, as expected, the ratio of mass-weighted to
light-weighted size is correlated with the $M_{*}/L$ gradient, but is also
mildly correlated with the mass surface density and mass-weighted size. The
colour gradients $(\nabla_{z-H})$ are mostly negative, with a median value of
$\sim0.45$ mag dex$^{-1}$, twice the local value. The evolution is caused by an
evolution in age gradients along the semi-major axis ($a$), with $\nabla_{age}
= d \log(age) / d \log(a)$ $\sim-0.33$, while the survival of weaker colour
gradients in old, local galaxies implies that metallicity gradients are also
required, with $\nabla_{Z} = d \log(Z) / d \log(a)$ $\sim-0.2$. This is
consistent with recent observational evidence for the inside-out growth of
passive galaxies at high redshift, and favours a gradual mass growth mechanism,
such as minor mergers.

quantum/classical versions have been studied in earlier literature. In this
work, we derive a generic local-moment model beyond the Heisenberg limit for
the hyperkagome iridate by considering multi-orbital interactions for all the
$t_{2g}$ orbitals and spin-orbit coupling. The lifting of massive classical

investigated at the classical level and the resulting phase diagram is
presented. We find that different anisotropy terms prefer distinct classes of
magnetically ordered phases, often with various discrete degeneracy. The
implications of our results for recent $\mu$SR and NMR experiments on this

Analysis of their cooling ages allows us to calculate their progenitor masses

intermediate-mass white dwarfs are in strong agreement with previous work over
this mass regime. The ultramassive white dwarf has $V$ = 24.5, $\sim$2 mag
fainter than the other two remnants. The spectrum of this star has lower

uncertainties that are several times higher than the brighter counterparts. We
measure these uncertainties and establish the star's final mass as the
highest-mass white dwarf discovered thus far in a cluster, but we are unable to
calculate its progenitor mass because at this high mass and cooler T$_{\rm

temperatures, however, this sensitivity of cooling age to an ultramassive white

takes advantage of the sparsity of astronomical objects in morphological

Although the main driver for our work is the deblending of strong gravitational

$\sim 100 \, M_\odot$ BH remnants of the first stars grow at super-Eddington
rate via radiatively inefficient slim accretion disks. We use an improved
version of the cosmological, data-constrained semi-analytic model
GAMETE/QSOdust, where we follow the evolution of nuclear BHs and gas cooling,
disk and bulge formation of their host galaxies. Adopting SDSS J1148+5251

that $\sim$ 80% of its SMBH mass is grown by super-Eddington accretion, which
can be sustained down to $z \sim 10$ in dense, gas-rich environments. The
average BH mass at $z \sim 20$ is $M_{\rm BH} \gtrsim 10^4 \,M_\odot$,
comparable to that of direct collapse BHs. At $z = 6.4$ the AGN-driven mass
outflow rate is consistent with the observations and the BH-to-bulge mass ratio
is compatible with the local scaling relation. However, the stellar mass in the
central 2.5 kpc is closer to the value inferred from CO observations. Finally,
$\sim 20 %$ of J1148 progenitors at $z=7.1$ have BH luminosities and masses
comparable to ULAS J1120+0641, suggesting that this quasar may be one of the

2-dimensional domain decomposing scheme, FastPM scales extremely well with a
very large number of CPUs. In contrast to COmoving-LAgrangian (COLA) approach,
we do not require to split the force or track separately the 2LPT solution,
reducing the code complexity and memory requirements. We compare FastPM with
different number of steps ($N_s$) and force resolution factor ($B$) against 3
benchmarks: halo mass function from Friends of Friends halo finder, halo and
dark matter power spectrum, and cross correlation coefficient (or
stochasticity), relative to a high resolution TreePM simulation. We show that
the modified time stepping scheme reduces the halo stochasticity when compared
to COLA with the same number of steps and force resolution. While increasing
$N_s$ and $B$ improves the transfer function and cross correlation coefficient,
for many applications FastPM achieves sufficient accuracy at low $N_s$ and $B$.
For example, $N_s=10$ and $B=2$ simulation provides a substantial saving (a
factor of 10) of computing time relative to $N_s=40$, $B=3$ simulation, yet the
halo benchmarks are very similar at $z=0$. We find that for abundance matched
halos the stochasticity remains low even for $N_s=5$. FastPM compares well
against less expensive schemes, being only 7 (4) times more expensive than 2LPT
initial condition generator for $N_s=10$ ($N_s=5$). Some of the applications
where FastPM can be useful are generating a large number of mocks, producing
non-linear statistics where one varies a large number of nuisance or
cosmological parameters, or serving as part of an initial conditions solver.

formyl radical HCO is an important candidate precursor for several O-bearing
terrestrial COMs in cores, as an abundant building block of many of these
molecules. Several chemical routes have been proposed to account for its
formation, both on grain surfaces, as an incompletely hydrogenated product of H
addition to frozen-out CO molecules, or in the gas phase, either the product of
the reaction between H2CO and a radical, or as a product of dissociative
recombination of protonated formaldehyde H2COH+. The detection and abundance
determination of H2COH+, if present, could provide clues as to whether this
latter scenario might apply. We searched for protonated formaldehyde H2COH+ in
the prestellar core L1689B using the IRAM 30m telescope. The H2COH+ ion is
unambiguously detected, for the first time in a cold (~10 K) source. The
derived abundance agrees with a scenario in which the formation of H2COH+
results from the protonation of formaldehyde. We use this abundance value to
constrain the branching ratio of the dissociative recombination of H2COH+
towards the HCO channel to ~10-30%. This value could however be smaller if HCO
can be efficiently formed from gas-phase neutral-neutral reactions, and we
stress the need for laboratory measurements of the rate constants of these
reactions at 10 K. Given the experimental difficulties in measuring branching
ratios experimentally, observations can bring valuable constraints on these
values, and provide a useful input for chemical networks.

included; this complicates the extraction of physical information from
Euclidean space calculations as one would do in lattice studies. The sign
problem arises in this system because the partition function for configurations
with fixed topological charge $Q$, $\mathcal{Z}_Q$, are summed weighted by
$\exp(i Q \theta)$ to obtain the partition function for fixed $\theta$, $
\mathcal{Z}(\theta)$. The sign problem gets exponentially worse numerically as
the space-time volume is increased. Here it is shown that apart from the
practical numerical issues associated with large volumes, there are some
interesting issues of principle. A key quantity is the energy density as a
function of $\theta$, $\varepsilon(\theta) = -\log \left( \mathcal{Z}(\theta)
\right )/V$. This is expected to be well defined in the large 4-volume limit.
Similarly, one expects the energy density for a fixed topological density
$\tilde{\varepsilon}(Q/V) = -\log \left(\mathcal{Z}_Q \right )/V$ to be well
defined in the limit of large 4-volumes. Intuitively, one might expect that if
one had the infinite volume expression for $\tilde{\varepsilon}(Q/V)$ to
arbitrary accuracy, that one could reconstruct $\varepsilon(\theta)$ by
directly summing over the topological sectors of the partition function. We
show here that there are circumstances where this is not the case. In
particular, this occurs in regions where the curvature of $\varepsilon(\theta)$
is negative.

low-mass dwarf galaxies. Here, we present a detailed study of a nearby
pure-disk dwarf galaxy NGC 2976. Unlike previously observed dwarf objects, this
galaxy possesses a clearly defined disk. For the purpose of our studies, we
performed deep multi-frequency polarimetric observations of NGC 2976 with the
VLA and Effelsberg radio telescopes. Additionally, we supplement them with
re-imaged data from the WSRT-SINGS survey. The magnetic field morphology
discovered in NGC 2976 consists of a southern polarized ridge. This structure
does not seem to be due to just a pure large-scale dynamo process (possibly
cosmic-ray driven) at work in this object, as indicated by the RM data and
dynamo number calculations. Instead, the field of NGC 2976 is modified by past
gravitational interactions and possibly also by ram pressure inside the M 81
galaxy group environment. The estimates of total (7 muG) and ordered (3 muG)
magnetic field strengths, as well as degree of field order (0.46), which is
similar to those observed in spirals, suggest that tidally generated magnetized
gas flows can further enhance dynamo action in the object. NGC 2976 is
apparently a good candidate for the efficient magnetization of its
neighbourhood. It is able to provide an ordered (perhaps also regular) magnetic
field into the intergalactic space up to a distance of about 5 kpc. Tidal
interactions (and possibly also ram pressure) can lead to the formation of
unusual magnetic field morphologies (like polarized ridges) in galaxies out of
the star-forming disks, which do not follow any observed component of the
interstellar medium (ISM), as observed in NGC 2976. These galaxies are able to
provide ordered magnetic fields far out of their main disks.

understanding almost every aspect of planet formation, where standard
alpha-disk models have been constantly employed for its simplicity. In the mean
time, disk mass loss has been conventionally attributed to photoevaporation,
which controls disk dispersal. However, a paradigm shift towards accretion
driven by magnetized disk winds has been realized in the recent years, thanks
to studies of non-ideal magneto-hydrodynamic effects in PPDs. I present a
framework of global PPD evolution aiming to incorporate these advances,
highlighting the role of wind-driven accretion and wind mass loss. Disk
evolution is found to be largely dominated by wind-driven processes, and
viscous spreading is suppressed. The timescale of disk evolution is controlled
primarily by the amount of external magnetic flux threading the disks, and how
rapidly the disk loses the flux. Rapid disk dispersal can be achieved if the
disk is able to hold most of its magnetic flux during the evolution. In
addition, because wind launching requires sufficient level of ionization at
disk surface (mainly via external far-UV radiation), wind kinematics is also
affected by far-UV penetration depth and disk geometry. For typical disk
lifetime of a few Myrs, the disk loses approximately the same amount of mass
through the wind as through accretion onto the protostar, and most of the wind
mass loss proceeds from the outer disk via a slow wind. Fractional wind mass
loss increases with increasing disk lifetime. Significant wind mass loss likely
substantially enhances the dust to gas mass ratio, and promotes planet
formation.

spin formalism, we further argue that the observed anisotropic correlation
effects can be understood by a model of orbital selective Mott transition at a
filling that is non-integer, but close to the half-filling. Because the
overlaps of wave functions between $d$ orbitals are modified by the strain,
orbitally-dependent renormalizations of the bandwidths and the crystal fields
occur with the application of strain. These renormalizations generally result
in different occupation numbers in different orbitals. We find that if the
system has a non-integer filling number near the half-filling such as for
VO$_2$, certain orbitals could reach an occupation number closer to
half-filling under the strain, resulting in a strong reduction in the
quasiparticle weight $Z_{\alpha}$ of that orbital. Moreover, an orbital
selective Mott transition, defined as the case with $Z_{\alpha} = 0$ in some,
but not all orbitals, could be accessed by epitaxial strain-engineering of

embodied biomineralized nanomagnets providing them the ability to orient with
the Earth's magnetic field. This property is presumably related to an
evolutionary advantage in finding the oxic-anoxic interface along the up and
down direction in aquatic environments. So far the magnetic field response by
MTB, called magnetotaxis, has been well described by a paramagnetic model where
bacteria orient passively along the field lines according to a purely physical
mechanism where magnetic torque and orientational Brownian noise compete. Here
we demonstrate using Magnetococcus marinus strain MC-1 as MTB model that
magnetotaxis shows more complex behaviors, which are affected by environmental
conditions of different types. Indeed while MC-1 swimmers are found to
essentially obey the paramagnetic paradigm when swimming in their growth
medium, they exhibit a run-and-tumble dynamics in a medium devoid of energy
source. Tumbling events are found to provide isotropic reorientation
capabilities causing the cells to escape from their prescribed field direction.
This behavior has a major influence on the capabilities of the cells to explore
their environment across field lines and represents an alternative search
strategy to the back-and-forth motion along field-imposed tracks. Moreover, we
show that aside chemical conditions, steric/geometrical constraints are also
able to trigger tumbling events through obstacle encountering. Overall,
physico-chemical environmental conditions appear to be important parameters
involved in the swimming properties of MTB. Depending on environmental
conditions, the run-and-tumble mobility may provide advantages in the search
for nutrient or ecological niche, in complement to classical magnetotaxis.

from the center of the galaxies of 1 to 8 disk scale lengths and have ages of
<20 Myrs and masses of 20 to 1E5 Msolar. The presence of young clusters and OB
associations in the outer disks of dwarf galaxies shows that dIrrs do have star
formation taking place there in spite of the extreme nature of the environment.
Most regions are found where the HI surface density is ~1 Msolar per pc2,
although both the HI and dispersed old stars go out much further. This limiting
density suggests a cutoff in the ability to form distinct OB associations and
perhaps even stars. We compare the star formation rates in the FUV regions to
the average rates expected at their radii and beyond from the observed gas,
using the conventional correlation for gas-rich regions. The localized rates
are typically 10% of the expected average rates for the outer disks. Either
star formation in dIrrs at surface densities <1 Msolar per pc2 occurs without
forming distinct associations, or the Kennicutt-Schmidt relation over-predicts
the rate beyond this point. In the latter case, the stellar disks in the

(prolate and oblate) is addressed from an analytical approach. Mathematically,
it consists in solving the Helmholtz equation in an unbounded domain with
Sommerfeld radiation condition at infinity. The domain where propagation takes
place is characterised by density and sound speed values $\rho_0$ and $c_0$,
respectively, while $\rho_1$ and $c_1$ are the corresponding density and sound
speed values of an immersed object that is responsible of the scattered field.
Since Helmholtz equation is separable in prolate/oblate spheroidal coordinates,
its exact solution for the scattered field can be expressed as an expansion on
prolate/oblate spheroidal functions multiplied by coefficients whose values
depend upon the boundary conditions verified at the medium-immersed fluid
obstacle interface. The general case ($c_0 \neq c_1$) is cumbersome because it
requires to solve successive matrix systems that are ill-conditioned when
$c_1/c_0$ is far from unity. In this paper, a numerical implementation of the
general exact solution that is valid for any range of eccentricity values and
for $c_0 \neq c_1$, is provided. The high level solver code has been written in
the Julia programming language while a software package recently released in

cases (Dirichlet and Neumann boundary conditions, spheroid tending to sphere)

signature and also on its role, in combination with neutrino cooling, in
determining the properties of the resulting hypermassive neutron star, of the

consistent with other recent studies that find that small mass ratios produce
more ejecta than equal mass cases (up to some limit) and this ejecta is more
neutron rich. This trend indicates the importance with future kilonovae
observations of measuring the individual masses of an associated binary neutron
star system, presumably from concurrent gravitational wave observations, in
order to be able to extract information about the nuclear equation of state

relative distribution of stellar and total mass in the cluster. We find that

with helium cores in the mass range 35 to 133 solar masses encounter the pair
instability and either explode or pulse until the core mass is less than 40
solar masses, smaller than the combined mass of the observed black holes. The
rotation of more massive helium cores is either braked by interaction with a
slowly rotating hydrogen envelope, if one is present, or by mass loss, if one
is not. The very short interval between the GW signal and the observed onset of
the putative GRB in GW 150914 is also too short to have come from a single
star. A more probable model for making the gravitational radiation is the
delayed merger of two black holes made by 70 and 90 solar mass stars in a
binary system. The more massive component was a pulsational-pair instability
supernova before making the first black hole.

structures of meta-GGAs are close to those of GGAs. They are smaller than the
more realistic gKS gaps of meta-GGAs, but probably close to the less-realistic
gaps in the band structure of the exact KS potential, as can be seen by
comparing with the gaps of the EXX+RPA OEP potential. The well-known grid

transport is dominated by charge exchange collisions. The solution of the
Boltzmann equation for the ions gives the exact form free of any divergence and
contains an additional term that is not included in the classical result. This
term includes collisional and geometric effects and leads to a noticeable
correction. Further, the question is addressed whether the space charge
argument at the bottom of the Bohm criterion can actually lead to a meaningful
definition of the transition point between bulk and sheath. The analysis is
supported by a numerical model and experiments, showing excellent agreement
throughout. As a novelty in diagnostics, the theoretical results allow from the
ion velocity distribution function (IVDF), measured at the wall, a
reconstruction of the IVDF and the electric field at any point in the plasma.
This property is used to reconstruct non-intrusively also the ion density, flow

effectively transparent to the probe pulse. The intensity range for which this

experimental verification. We present predictions for clusters at the peak of

the case of the MWU algorithm, although it scales logarithmically in the number
of pure strategies or experts $N$ in terms of regret, the algorithm takes time
polynomial in $N$; this especially becomes a problem when learning
combinatorial objects. We give a general recipe to simulate the multiplicative
weights update algorithm in time polynomial in their natural dimension. This is
useful whenever there exists a polynomial time generalized counting oracle
(even if approximate) over these objects. Finally, using the combinatorial
structure of symmetric Nash-equilibria (SNE) when both players play bases of
matroids, we show that these can be found with a single projection or convex
minimization (without using online learning).

the oxides Sr3NiIrO6, Sr2IrO4 and Na2IrO3 exhibit preferred orientations with
respect to their IrO6 octahedra. We evaluated the magnetic anisotropies of
these S = 1/2 ions on the basis of DFT calculations including spin-orbit
coupling (SOC), and probed their origin by performing perturbation theory
analyses with SOC as perturbation within the LS coupling scheme. The observed
spin orientations of Sr3NiIrO6 and Sr2IrO4 are correctly predicted by DFT
calculations, and are accounted for by the perturbation theory analysis. As for
the spin orientation of Na2IrO3, both experimental studies and DFT calculations
have not been unequivocal. Our analysis reveals that the Ir4+ spin orientation
of Na2IrO3 should have nonzero components along the c- and a-axes directions.
The spin orientations determined by DFT calculations are sensitive to the
accuracy of the crystal structures employed, which is explained by perturbation
theory analyses when interactions between adjacent Ir4+ ions are taken into
consideration. There are indications implying that the 5d electrons of Na2IrO3
are less strongly localized compared with those of Sr3NiIrO6 and Sr2IrO4. This
implication was confirmed by showing that the Madelung potentials of the Ir4+
ions are less negative in Na2IrO3 than in Sr3NiIrO6, Sr2IrO4. Most
transition-metal S = 1/2 ions do have magnetic anisotropies because the SOC
induces interactions among their crystal-field split d-states, and the
associated mixing of the states modifies only the orbital parts of the states.
This finding cannot be mimicked by a spin Hamiltonian because this model
Hamiltonian lacks the orbital degree of freedom, thereby leading to the
spin-half syndrome. The spin-orbital entanglement for the 5d spin-half ions
Ir4+ is not as strong as has been assumed lately.

order the ion Larmor radius. The mirror instability generates fluctuations of
magnetic-field strength $\delta B / B \sim 1$. These fluctuations act as
magnetic traps for the heat-conducting electrons, suppressing their transport.
We calculate the effective parallel thermal conductivity in the ICM in the
presence of the mirror fluctuations for different stages of the evolution of
the instability. The mirror fluctuations are limited in amplitude by the
maximum and minimum values of the field strength, with no large deviations from
the mean value. This key property leads to a finite suppression of thermal
conduction at large scales. We find suppression down to $\approx 0.2$ of the
Spitzer value for the secular phase of the perturbations' growth, and $\approx
0.3$ for their saturated phase. The effect operates in addition to other
suppression mechanisms and independently of them. Globally, fluctuations
$\delta B / B \sim 1$ can be present on much larger scales, of the order of the
scale of turbulent motions. However, we do not expect large suppression of
thermal conduction by these, because their scale is considerably larger than
the collisional mean free path of the ICM electrons. The obtained suppression
of thermal conduction by a factor of $\sim 5$ appears to be characteristic and
potentially universal for a weakly collisional mirror-unstable plasma.

galactic scales. Several threads point to excessive halo concentration,
including central densities that rise too steeply with decreasing radius. Yet,
random fluctuations in the gaseous component can 'heat' the centres of haloes,
decreasing their densities. We present a theoretical model deriving this effect
from first principles: stochastic variations in the gas density are converted
into potential fluctuations that act on the dark matter; the associated force
correlation function is calculated and the corresponding stochastic equation
solved. Assuming a power law spectrum of fluctuations with maximal and minimal
cutoff scales, we derive the velocity dispersion imparted to the halo particles
and the relevant relaxation time. We further perform numerical simulations,
with fluctuations realised as a Gaussian random field, which confirm the
formation of a core within a timescale comparable to that derived analytically.
Non-radial collective modes enhance the energy transport process that erases
the cusp, though the parametrisations of the analytical model persist.
  In our model, the dominant contribution to the dynamical coupling driving the
cusp-core transformation comes from the largest scale fluctuations. Yet, the
efficiency of the transformation is independent of the value of the largest
scale and depends weakly (linearly) on the power law exponent; it effectively
depends on two parameters: the gas mass fraction and the normalisation of the
power spectrum. This suggests that cusp-core transformations observed in
hydrodynamic simulations of galaxy formation may be understood and parametrised
in simple terms, the physical and numerical complexities of the various
implementations notwithstanding.

to the red giant branch (RGB) of a structure in both colour and magnitude
space. Using this algorithm, we are able to generate probability distributions
in distance, metallicity and RGB width for a series of subfields spanning these
structures. Specifically, we confirm a distance gradient of approximately 20
kpc per degree along a 6 degree extension of the Giant Stellar Stream, with the
farthest subfields from M31 lying ~ 120 kpc more distant than the inner-most
subfields. Further, we find a metallicity that steadily increases from
-0.7^{+0.1}_{-0.1} dex to -0.2^{+0.2}_{-0.1} dex along the inner half of the
stream before steadily dropping to a value of -1.0^{+0.2}_{-0.2} dex at the
farthest reaches of our coverage. The RGB width is found to increase rapidly
from 0.4^{+0.1}_{-0.1} dex to 1.1^{+0.2}_{-0.1} dex in the inner portion of the
stream before plateauing and decreasing marginally in the outer subfields of
the stream. In addition, we estimate Stream C to lie at a distance between 794

metallicity of Stream C to lie in the range -0.7 to -1.6 dex and a metallicity

many developments of traditional computational models have been proposed with
the aim of taking into account the new demands of computer systems users and
the new capabilities of computation engines. A new computational model, or a
new feature in a traditional one, usually is reflected in a new family of
programming languages, and new paradigms of software development.
  The aim of the DCM workshop series is to bring together researchers who are
currently developing new computational models or new features for traditional
computational models, in order to foster their interaction, to provide a forum
for presenting new ideas and work in progress, and to enable newcomers to learn
about current activities in this area. Topics of interest include all abstract
models of computation and their applications to the development of programming
languages and systems.

blocking concurrent transactions at the cost of having a validation phase. Upon
failure in the validation phase, the transaction is usually aborted and
restarted from scratch. The ""abort and restart"" approach becomes a performance
bottleneck for the use cases with high contention objects or long running
transactions. In addition, restarting from scratch creates a negative feedback
loop in the system, because the system incurs additional overhead that may
create even further conflicts.
  In this paper, we propose a novel approach for conflict resolution in MVCC
for in-memory databases. This low overhead approach summarizes the transaction
programs in the form of a dependency graph. The dependency graph also contains
the constructs used in the validation phase of the MVCC algorithm. Then, in the
case of encountering conflicts among transactions, the conflict locations in
the program are quickly detected, and the conflicting transactions are
partially re-executed. This approach maximizes the reuse of the computations
done in the initial execution round, and increases the transaction processing
throughput.

finite set of experts or servers are employed to extract information about a
stream of incoming jobs. Each job is associated with a hidden label drawn from
some prior distribution. An inspection by an expert produces a noisy outcome
that depends both on the job's hidden label and the type of the expert, and
occupies the expert for a finite time duration. A decision maker's task is to
dynamically assign inspections so that the resulting outcomes can be used to

provides an adaptive inspection policy that is asymptotically optimal in the

It plays an important role in follow-up of cancer patients with liver
metastases. We present an interactive segmentation approach for liver tumors in
US acquisitions. Due to the low image quality and the low contrast between the
tumors and the surrounding tissue in US images, the segmentation is very
challenging. Thus, the clinical practice still relies on manual measurement and
outlining of the tumors in the US images. We target this problem by applying an
interactive segmentation algorithm to the US data, allowing the user to get
real-time feedback of the segmentation results. The algorithm has been
developed and tested hand-in-hand by physicians and computer scientists to make
sure a future practical usage in a clinical setting is feasible. To cover
typical acquisitions from the clinical routine, the approach has been evaluated
with dozens of datasets where the tumors are hyperechoic (brighter), hypoechoic
(darker) or isoechoic (similar) in comparison to the surrounding liver tissue.
Due to the interactive real-time behavior of the approach, it was possible even
in difficult cases to find satisfying segmentations of the tumors within
seconds and without parameter settings, and the average tumor deviation was
only 1.4mm compared with manual measurements. However, the long term goal is to
ease the volumetric acquisition of liver tumors in order to evaluate for
treatment response. Additional aim is the registration of intraoperative US
images via the interactive segmentations to the patient's pre-interventional CT
acquisitions.

Two of these had previously been argued to be black hole candidates on the

neutron stars are in hard states. We show that these two sources are likely to
be Z-sources (i.e. low magnetic field neutron stars accreting near their
Eddington limits), or perhaps bright atoll sources (low magnetic field neutron
stars which are just a bit fainter than this level) on the basis of
simultaneous Swift and NuSTAR spectra which cover a broader range of energies.
These new observations reveal spectral curvature above 6-8 keV that would be
hard to detect without the broader energy coverage the NuSTAR data provide
relative to Chandra and XMM-Newton. We show that the other three sources are
also likely to be bright neutron star X-ray binaries, rather than black hole
X-ray binaries. We discuss why it should already have been realized that it was
unlikely that these objects were black holes on the basis of their being
persistent sources, and we re-examine past work which suggested that tidal
capture products would be persistently bright X-ray emitters. We discuss how
this problem is likely due to neglecting disk winds in older work that predict

holographic models originally proposed by Gubser and Nellore. By tuning the
dilaton potential, one is able to holographically mimic a first order, a second
order, or a crossover transition. In a first order phase transition,
$\Gamma_{\textrm{CS}}/sT$ jumps at the critical temperature (as previously
found in the holographic literature), while in a second order phase transition
it develops an infinite slope. On the other hand, in a crossover,
$\Gamma_{\textrm{CS}}/sT$ behaves smoothly, although displaying a fast
variation around the pseudo-critical temperature. In all the cases,
$\Gamma_{\textrm{CS}}/sT$ increases with decreasing $T$. The behavior of the
Chern-Simons diffusion rate across different phase transitions is expected to
play a relevant role for the chiral magnetic effect around the QCD critical end
point, which is a second order phase transition point connecting a crossover
band to a line of first order phase transition. Our findings in the present

results on the effect of pump focusing on conditional down-converted photon

efficiency decreases asymptotically with pump beam focusing parameter. We
attribute this behaviour to (a) the asymmetry in the spatial distribution of
down-converted photons with the pump beam focusing parameter and (b) the
ellipticity of biphoton modes introduced due to the focusing of the pump beam.

diverse, yet an individual pattern is robustly reproducible by a single species

argue that the pattern diversity and reproducibility may be explained by
interpreting the pattern development as a first-order phase transition to a
spatially modulated phase. Brazovskii showed that for such transitions on a
flat, infinite sheet, the patterns are uniform striped or hexagonal. Biological
objects, however, have finite extent and offer different topologies, such as
the spherical surfaces of pollen grains. We consider Brazovskii transitions on
spheres and show that the patterns have a richer phenomenology than simple
stripes or hexagons. We calculate the free energy difference between the
unpatterned state and the many possible patterned phases, taking into account
fluctuations and the system's finite size. The proliferation of variety on a
sphere may be understood as a consequence of topology, which forces defects
into perfectly ordered phases. The defects are then accommodated in different
ways. We also argue that the first-order character of the transition is
responsible for the reproducibility and robustness of the pattern formation.

make the best use of the available baseline. In particular, we show how partial
transitivity of inter-personal similarity can be exploited to improve the
retrieval of particularly challenging sets which poorly match the query under
the baseline measure. We: (i) describe the use of proxy sets as a means of
computing the similarity between two sets, (ii) introduce transitivity
meta-features based on the similarity of salient modes of appearance variation
between sets, (iii) show how quasi-transitivity can be learnt from such
features without any labelling or manual intervention, and (iv) demonstrate the
effectiveness of the proposed methodology through experiments on the
notoriously challenging YouTube database and two successful baselines from the

items and bidders' valuations are independent among bidders but negatively
correlated among items.
  In this paper, we obtain the closed-form optimal auction for this setting, by
directly addressing the two difficulties above. In particular, the first
difficulty is that when pointwise maximizing virtual surplus under
multi-dimensional feasibility (i.e., the Border feasibility), (1) neither the
optimal interim allocation is trivially monotone in the virtual value, (2) nor
the virtual value is monotone in the bidder's type. As a result, the optimal
interim allocations resulting from virtual surplus maximization no longer
guarantees BIC. To address (1), we prove a generalization of Border's theorem
and show that optimal interim allocation is indeed monotone in the virtual
value. To address (2), we adapt Myerson's ironing procedure to this setting by
redefining the (ironed) virtual value as a function of the lowest utility
point. The second difficulty, perhaps a more challenging one, is that the
lowest utility type in general is no longer at the endpoints of the type
interval. To address this difficulty, we show by construction that there exist
an allocation rule and an induced lowest utility type such that they form a
solution of the virtual surplus maximization and in the meanwhile guarantees
IIR. In the single bidder case, the optimal auction consists of a randomized
bundle menu and a deterministic bundle menu; while in the multiple bidder case,
the optimal auction is a randomization between two extreme mechanisms. The
optimal solutions of our setting can be implemented by a Bayesian IC and IR
auction, however, perhaps surprisingly, the revenue of this auction cannot be
achieved by any (dominant-strategy) IC and IR auction.

Metallic nanoparticles allow efficient coupling to far field radiation, yet
their synthesis typically leads to poor material quality. Metallic films offer
substantially higher quality materials, but their coupling to radiation is
typically jeopardized due to the large momentum mismatch with free space. Here,
we propose and theoretically investigate optically thin metallic films as an
ideal platform for high-radiative-efficiency plasmonics. For far-field
scattering, adding a thin high-quality metallic substrate enables a higher
quality factor while maintaining the localization and tunability that the
nanoparticle provides. For near-field spontaneous emission, a thin metallic
substrate, of high quality or not, greatly improves the field overlap between
the emitter environment and propagating surface plasmons, enabling high-Purcell
(total enhancement > $10^4$), high-quantum-yield (> 50 %) spontaneous emission,
even as the gap size vanishes (3$\sim$5 nm). The enhancement has almost
spatially independent efficiency and does not suffer from quenching effects

problem in a semi-supervised setting, where one observes $n$ labeled vertices,
and the task is to label the remaining ones. We present a theoretical study of
$\ell_p$-based Laplacian regularization under a $d$-dimensional geometric
random graph model. We provide a variational characterization of the
performance of this regularized learner as $N$ grows to infinity while $n$
stays constant, the associated optimality conditions lead to a partial
differential equation that must be satisfied by the associated function
estimate $\hat{f}$. From this formulation we derive several predictions on the
limiting behavior the $d$-dimensional function $\hat{f}$, including (a) a phase
transition in its smoothness at the threshold $p = d + 1$, and (b) a tradeoff
between smoothness and sensitivity to the underlying unlabeled data
distribution $P$. Thus, over the range $p \leq d$, the function estimate
$\hat{f}$ is degenerate and ""spiky,"" whereas for $p\geq d+1$, the function
estimate $\hat{f}$ is smooth. We show that the effect of the underlying density
vanishes monotonically with $p$, such that in the limit $p = \infty$,
corresponding to the so-called Absolutely Minimal Lipschitz Extension, the
estimate $\hat{f}$ is independent of the distribution $P$. Under the assumption
of semi-supervised smoothness, ignoring $P$ can lead to poor statistical
performance, in particular, we construct a specific example for $d=1$ to
demonstrate that $p=2$ has lower risk than $p=\infty$ due to the former penalty
adapting to $P$ and the latter ignoring it. We also provide simulations that
verify the accuracy of our predictions for finite sample sizes. Together, these
properties show that $p = d+1$ is an optimal choice, yielding a function
estimate $\hat{f}$ that is both smooth and non-degenerate, while remaining
maximally sensitive to $P$.

application of our SVRG analysis is a nearly-optimal algorithm for regularized

complexity and runtime complexity, when the data is randomly partitioned and
the condition number can be as large as the data size per machine (up to

restrict users from unauthorized access, but in cloud environment access
control policies are more flexible. However, an attacker can gather sensitive

thunderstorms is numerically investigated using the Bryan Cloud Model 1 (CM1).
The orography is varied by three mountain heights and is varied in four
different positions, effectively producing 12 different terrain configurations.
It is found that the different orientations produce variations in the supercell
life cycle with shorter cycles for higher inflow rates. Furthermore, these
cycles are associated with the storm reaching its minimum intensity just after
a peak rain period. Moreover, the effect of stronger inflow was seen before
direct storm-terrain interactions started. The higher inflow also played a
significant role in increasing rainfall rate and areal extent, to the point
that further convection, associated with the cold pool, was triggered adding to
rainfall amount. Using a stricter form of the National Weather Service Tornado
Detection Algorithm to investigate the tornadic nature of simulated supercells;
it is found that terrain blocking effects are dominative and that elongating
the terrain axis approximately parallel to the propagation vector produced the
strongest potential to generate a tornadic supercell thunderstorm. Although the
simulated case with the highest mountain produced the most tornadic
thunderstorms it is seen that increasing the terrain height alone is not
sufficient to make tornadogenesis more probable as more tornadic supercells
were simulated with lower heights compared to moderate terrain heights.

sparse set visualizations. Our input is a set of points in the plane which are
either blue, red, or purple. Blue points belong exclusively to the blue set,
red points belong exclusively to the red set, and purple points belong to both

edges connecting the points such that the subgraph induced by the red and
purple points is connected, and the subgraph induced by the blue and purple

  We study the geometric properties of minimum RBP spanning graphs and the
algorithmic problems associated with computing them. Specifically, we show that
the general problem can be solved in polynomial time using matroid techniques.
In addition, we discuss more efficient algorithms for the case in which points
are located on a line or a circle, and also describe a fast $(\frac

unknown physical origin that appear to come from extragalactic distances.
Previous follow-up observations have failed to find additional bursts at the
same dispersion measures (i.e. integrated column density of free electrons
between source and telescope) and sky position as the original detections. The
apparent non-repeating nature of the fast radio bursts has led several authors
to hypothesise that they originate in cataclysmic astrophysical events. Here we
report the detection of ten additional bursts from the direction of FRB121102,
using the 305-m Arecibo telescope. These new bursts have dispersion measures
and sky positions consistent with the original burst. This unambiguously
identifies FRB121102 as repeating and demonstrates that its source survives the
energetic events that cause the bursts. Additionally, the bursts from FRB121102
show a wide range of spectral shapes that appear to be predominantly intrinsic
to the source and which vary on timescales of minutes or shorter. While there
may be multiple physical origins for the population of fast radio bursts, the
repeat bursts with high dispersion measure and variable spectra specifically
seen from FRB121102 support models that propose an origin in a young, highly
magnetised, extragalactic neutron star.

packets through WiFi networks rather than cellular networks, is a promising
solution to alleviating the heavy traffic burden of cellular networks due to
data explosion. However, since WiFi networks are intermittently available, a
mobile device user in WiFi offloading usually needs to wait for WiFi connection
and thus experiences longer delay of packet transmission. To motivate users to
participate in WiFi offloading, cellular network operators give incentives
(rewards like coupons, e-coins) to users who wait for WiFi connection and
transmit packets through WiFi networks.
  In this paper, we aim at maximizing users' rewards while meeting constraints
on queue stability and energy consumption. However, we face scheduling
challenges from random packet arrivals, intermittent WiFi connection and time
varying wireless link states. To address these challenges, we first formulate
the problem as a stochastic optimization problem. We then propose an optimal
scheduling policy, named Optimal scheduling Policy under Energy Constraint
(OPEC), which makes online decisions as to when to delay packet transmission to
wait for WiFi connection and which wireless link (WiFi link or cellular link)
to transmit packets on. OPEC automatically adapts to random packet arrivals and
time varying wireless link states, not requiring a priori knowledge of packet
arrival and wireless link probabilities. As verified by simulations, OPEC
scheduling policy can achieve the maximum rewards while keeping queue stable
and meeting energy consumption constraint.

function of the epicycle frequency and Toomre's $Q$. As the epicycle frequency
increases, the pitch angle and radial wavelength increases, while the azimuthal
wavelength decreases. The pitch angle and radial wavelength increases with $Q$,
while the azimuthal wavelength weakly depends on $Q$. The amplification factor
decreases with $Q$ rapidly. In order to confirm the swing amplification model,
we perform local $N$-body simulations. The wavelengths and pitch angle by the
swing amplification model are in good agreement with those by $N$-body
simulations. The dependence of the amplification factor on the epicycle
frequency in $N$-body simulations is generally consistent with that in the
swing amplification model. Using these results, we estimate the number of
spiral arms as a function of the shear rate. The number of spiral arms
increases with the shear rate if the disk to halo mass ratio is fixed.

For this analysis, we have examined the reproducibility of the NXB model of
HXD/GSO using blank sky data. We find that the residual count rate in the 90 --
500 keV band is distributed around an average of 0.19\% with a standard

the total ejecta mass surrounding the radioactive material, the ratio between
continuum and line flux in the soft gamma-ray regime might distinguish
different progenitor models. The {\it Suzaku} data have been examined with this
relation at $t=77\pm2$ days, but could not distinguish models between single

phase transition at approximately the same pressure as its two end compounds

diffraction. We find that the intensity of the lower Zn-S sub-mode of
ZnSe68S32, due to Zn-S bonds vibrating in their own (S-like) environment,
decreases under pressure (Raman scattering), whereas its frequency
progressively converges onto that of the upper Zn- S sub-mode, due to Zn-S
vibrations in the foreign (Se-like) environment (ab initio calculations).
Ultimately, only the latter sub-mode survives. A similar phonon freezing was
earlier evidenced with the well-resolved percolation-type Be-Se doublet of
ZnBeSe [Pradhan et al. Phys. Rev. B 81, 115207 (2010)], that exhibits a large
contrast in the pressure-induced structural transitions of its end compounds.
We deduce that the above collapse and convergence process is intrinsic to the

Besides, marked differences in the phonon polariton Raman lineshapes in the two

while descending the S like dispersion towards the Brillouin zone centre. In
the reinforcement regime E is large, leading to intramode on top of intermode

both exhibit a fine structure on account of the alloy disorder. In contrast, in

necessary to impose boundary or interface conditions not as essential
conditions -- i.e. through the finite element space -- but through the

Nitsche's method a stabilization parameter $\lambda$ has to be chosen
""sufficiently large"" to provide a stable formulation. Sometimes discretizations
based on a Nitsche formulation are criticized because of the need to manually
choose this parameter. While in the discontinuous Galerkin community variants
of the Nitsche method -- known as ""interior penalty"" method in the DG context
-- are known which do not require such a manually chosen stabilization
parameter, this has not been considered for Nitsche formulations in other
contexts. We introduce and analyse such a parameter-free variant for two
applications of Nitsche's method. First, the classical Nitsche formulation for
the imposition of boundary conditions with fitted meshes and secondly, an
unfitted finite element discretizations for the imposition of interface
conditions is considered. The introduced variants of corresponding Nitsche
formulations do not change the sparsity pattern and can easily be implemented
into existing finite element codes. The benefit of the new formulations is the
removal of the Nitsche stabilization parameter $\lambda$ while keeping the
stability properties of the original formulations for a ""sufficiently large""
stabilization parameter $\lambda$.

partition quality functions. Our results generalize the impossibility result of
[Kleinberg 2003] by considering sets of weaker properties. In particular, we
use an alternative notion to solve the central issue of the consistency
property. (The latter means that modifying the graph in a way consistent with a
partition should not have counterintuitive effects). Our results clearly show
that community partition methods should not be expected to perfectly satisfy
all ideally desired properties.
  We then proceed to show that this incompatibility no longer holds when
slightly relaxed versions of the properties are considered, and we provide in
fact examples of simple quality functions satisfying these relaxed properties.
An experimental study of these quality functions shows a behavior comparable to
established methods in some situations, but more debatable results in others.
This suggests that defining a notion of good partition in communities probably
requires imposing additional properties.

robots and other autonomous systems. When the policy is trained to process raw
sensory inputs, such as images and depth maps, it can also acquire a strategy
that combines perception and control. However, effectively processing such
complex inputs requires an expressive policy class, such as a large neural
network. These high-dimensional policies are difficult to train, especially
when learning to control safety-critical systems. We propose PLATO, an
algorithm that trains complex control policies with supervised learning, using
model-predictive control (MPC) to generate the supervision, hence never in need
of running a partially trained and potentially unsafe policy. PLATO uses an
adaptive training method to modify the behavior of MPC to gradually match the
learned policy in order to generate training samples at states that are likely
to be visited by the learned policy. PLATO also maintains the MPC cost as an
objective to avoid highly undesirable actions that would result from strictly
following the learned policy before it has been fully trained. We prove that
this type of adaptive MPC expert produces supervision that leads to good
long-horizon performance of the resulting policy. We also empirically
demonstrate that MPC can still avoid dangerous on-policy actions in unexpected
situations during training. Our empirical results on a set of challenging
simulated aerial vehicle tasks demonstrate that, compared to prior methods,
PLATO learns faster, experiences substantially fewer catastrophic failures
(crashes) during training, and often converges to a better policy.

by prolonged star formation activity from the oldest epochs until star
formation was quenched ~6 Gyr ago, and, notably, only half of the mass in stars
of And XVI was in place 10 Gyr ago. And XVI appears to be a low mass galaxy for
which the early quenching by either reionization or starburst feedback seems
highly unlikely, and thus, is most likely due to an environmental effect (e.g.,
an interaction), possibly connected to a late infall in the densest regions of
the Local Group. Studying the star formation history as a function of
galactocentric radius, we detect a mild gradient in the star formation history:
the star formation activity between 6 and 8 Gyr ago is significantly stronger
in the central regions than in the external regions, although the quenching age
appears to be the same, within 1 Gyr. We also report the discovery of 9 RR
Lyrae stars, 8 of which belong to And XVI. The RR Lyrae stars allow a new

variety $J$. In this paper, we study the canonical height $\hat{h} \colon J(K)

which are important in applications:
  (1) for a given $P \in J(K)$, compute $\hat{h}(P)$ efficiently;
  (2) for a given bound $B > 0$, find all $P \in J(K)$ with $\hat{h}(P) \le B$.
  We develop an algorithm running in polynomial time (and fast in practice) to
deal with the first problem. Regarding the second problem, we show how one can
tweak the naive height $h$ that is usually used to obtain significantly
improved bounds for the difference $h - \hat{h}$, which allows a much faster
enumeration of the desired set of points.
  Our approach is to use the standard decomposition of $h(P) - \hat{h}(P)$ as a
sum of local `height correction functions'. We study these functions carefully,
which leads to efficient ways of computing them and to essentially optimal
bounds. To get our polynomial-time algorithm, we have to avoid the
factorization step needed to find the finite set of places where the correction
might be nonzero. The main innovation at this point is to replace factorization
into primes by factorization into coprimes.
  Most of our results are valid for more general fields with a set of absolute
values satisfying the product formula.

eventually, become white dwarfs accreting from a non-degenerate companion at
rates leading to a supernova explosion. We have computed the hydrodynamical
phase of the explosion of Chandrasekhar-mass white dwarfs harboring hybrid
cores, assuming that the explosion starts at the center, either as a detonation
(as may be expected in some degenerate merging scenarios) or as a deflagration
(that afterwards transitions into a delayed detonation). We assume these hybrid
cores are made of a central CO volume, of mass M(CO), surrounded by an ONe
shell. We show that, in case of a pure detonation, a medium-sized CO-rich
region, M(CO)<0.4 Msun, results in the ejection of a small fraction of the
mantle while leaving a massive bound remnant. Part of this remnant is made of
the products of the detonation, Fe-group nuclei, but they are buried in its
inner regions, unless convection is activated during the ensuing cooling and
shrinking phase of the remnant. In contrast, and somehow paradoxically, delayed
detonations do not leave remnants but for the minimum M(CO) we have explored,
M(CO)=0.2 Msun, and even in this case the remnant is as small as 0.13 Msun. The
ejecta produced by these delayed detonations are characterized by slightly
smaller masses of 56Ni and substantially smaller kinetic energies than obtained
for a delayed detonation of a 'normal' CO white dwarf. The optical emission
expected from these explosions would hardly match the observational properties
of typical Type Ia supernovae, although they make interesting candidates for
the subluminous class of SN2002cx-like or SNIax.

conjunction is a quantifier denoting access permission to an unbounded set of
heap locations. In contrast to recursive predicates, iterated separating
conjunctions do not prescribe a structure on the locations they range over, and
so do not restrict how to traverse and modify these locations. This flexibility
is important for the verification of random-access data structures such as
arrays and data structures that can be traversed in multiple ways such as
graphs. Despite its usefulness, no automatic program verifier natively supports
iterated separating conjunctions; they are especially difficult to incorporate

  In this paper, we present the first symbolic execution technique to support
general iterated separating conjunctions. We propose a novel representation of
symbolic heaps and flexible support for logical specifications that quantify
over heap locations. Our technique exhibits predictable and fast performance

Excitation and damping of eccentricity can occur through Lindblad and

research, where expressiveness and efficient algorithms for query evaluation
are conflicting goals. To better handle dynamically changing data, recent work
has been done on designing query languages that can compare values stored in
the graph database, without hard coding the values in the query. The main idea
is to allow variables in the query and bind the variables to values when
evaluating the query. For query languages that bind variables only once, query
evaluation is usually NP-complete. There are query languages that allow binding
inside the scope of Kleene star operators, which can themselves be in the scope
of bindings and so on. Uncontrolled nesting of binding and iteration within one
another results in query evaluation being PSPACE-complete.
  We define a way to syntactically control the nesting depth of iterated
bindings, and study how this affects expressiveness and efficiency of query
evaluation. The result is an infinite, syntactically defined hierarchy of
expressions. We prove that the corresponding language hierarchy is strict.
Given an expression in the hierarchy, we prove that it is undecidable to check
if there is a language equivalent expression at lower levels. We prove that
evaluating a query based on an expression at level i can be done in $\Sigma_i$
in the polynomial time hierarchy. Satisfiability of quantified Boolean formulas
can be reduced to query evaluation; we study the relationship between
alternations in Boolean quantifiers and the depth of nesting of iterated
bindings.

boundary trace mapping with measurability. Instead of using variational methods
alone, the reformulation of the BVP derives also from Cameron-Martin space
techniques. The reformulation essentially returns the study of irregular white
noise loads to study of $L^2$-loads.
  Admissibility of the reformulation is demonstrated by showing that usual
finite element approximations of the BVP with discretized white noise loads
converge to the solution of the reformulated problem. For Neumann and Robin
BVPs, the finite dimensional approximations have been utilized before. However,
here also the infinite-dimensional limit is considered.

collisions, a probe of the density dependence of symmetry energy above the
saturation point, has been proven in a previous study to be extremely sensitive
to the strength of the isovector $\Delta$(1232) potential in nuclear matter. As
there is no knowledge, either from theory or experiment, about the magnitude of
this quantity, the extraction of constraints on the slope of the symmetry
energy at saturation by using exclusively the mentioned observable is hindered
at present. It is shown that, by including the ratio of average $p_T$ of
charged pions $\langle p_T^{(\pi^+)}\rangle/\langle p_T^{(\pi^-)}\rangle$ in
the list of fitted observables, the noted problem can be circumvented. A
realistic description of this observable requires accounting for the
interaction of pions with the dense nuclear matter environment by the
incorporation of the so called $S$-wave and $P$-wave pion optical potentials.
This is performed within the framework of a quantum molecular dynamics
transport model that enforces the conservation of the total energy of the
system. It is shown that constraints on the slope of the symmetry energy at
saturation density and the strength of the $\Delta$(1232) potential can be
simultaneously extracted. A symmetry energy with a value of the slope parameter
$L>$ 50 MeV is favored, at 1$\sigma$ confidence level, from a comparison with
published FOPI experimental data. A precise constraint will require
experimental data more accurate than presently available, particularly for the
charged pion multiplicity ratio, and better knowledge of the density and
momentum dependence of the pion potential for the whole range of these two
variables probed in intermediate energy heavy-ion collisions.

the simplest mushroom billiard, which has a smooth such boundary, but
surprisingly subtle behaviour. As a measure of stickiness, we investigate P(t),
the probability of remaining in the mushroom cap for at least time t given
uniform initial conditions in the chaotic part of the cap. The stickiness is
sensitively dependent on the radius of the stem r via the Diophantine
properties of rho = (2/\pi) arccos r. Almost all rho give rise to families of
marginally unstable periodic orbits (MUPOs) where P(t) ~ C/t, dominating the
stickiness of the boundary. Here we consider the case where rho is MUPO-free

that t^2 P(t) is bounded, varying infinitely often between values whose ratio
is at least 32/27. When rho has an eventually periodic continued fraction
expansion, that is, a quadratic irrational, t^2 P(t) converges to a
log-periodic function. In general, we expect less regular behaviour, with upper

network are organised in levels, has recently been shown to be closely related
to many structural and dynamical aspects of complex systems, including graph
eigenspectra, the prevalence or absence of feed-back cycles, and linear
stability. Furthermore, non-trivial trophic structures have been observed in
networks of neurons, species, genes, metabolites, cellular signalling,
concatenated words, P2P users, and world trade. Here we consider two simple yet
apparently quite different dynamical models -- one a
Susceptible-Infected-Susceptible (SIS) epidemic model adapted to include
complex contagion, the other an Amari-Hopfield neural network -- and show that
in both cases the related spreading processes are modulated in similar ways by
the trophic coherence of the underlying networks. To do this, we propose a
network assembly model which can generate structures with tunable trophic
coherence, limiting in either perfectly stratified networks or random graphs.
We find that trophic coherence can exert a qualitative change in spreading
behaviour, determining whether a pulse of activity will percolate through the
entire network or remain confined to a subset of nodes, and whether such
activity will quickly die out or endure indefinitely. These results could be
important for our understanding of phenomena such as epidemics, rumours, shocks
to ecosystems, neuronal avalanches, and many other spreading processes.

requiring full-duplex capability of user devices, inter-node interference - in
addition to the inherent self-interference - can severely degrade the
performance. Therefore, as methods that provide effective self-interference
mitigation evolve, the management of inter-node interference is becoming
increasingly important. This paper considers a cellular system in which a
full-duplex capable base station serves a set of half-duplex capable users. As
the spectral efficiencies achieved by the uplink and downlink transmissions are
inherently intertwined, the objective is to device channel assignment and power
control algorithms that maximize the weighted sum of the uplink-downlink

algorithm is proposed, in which the scheduled uplink users and the base station
jointly determine the set of downlink users for full-duplex transmission.
Realistic system simulations indicate that the spectral efficiency can be up to
89% better than using the traditional half-duplex mode. Furthermore, when the
self-interference cancelling level is high, the impact of the user-to-user
interference is severe unless properly managed.

vertices $\mathbb{Z}/p\mathbb{Z}$, and with edges connecting vertices whose sum
is a quadratic residue. Paley graphs are notoriously difficult to study,
particularly finding bounds for their clique numbers. For this reason, it is
desirable to have a random model. A well known result of Graham and Ringrose
shows that the clique number of the Paley graph is $\Omega(\log p\log\log\log
p)$ (even $\Omega(\log p\log\log p)$, under the generalized Riemann hypothesis)
for infinitely many primes $p$ -- a behaviour not detected by the random Cayley
graph which is hence deficient as a random model for for the Paley graph. In
this paper we give a new probabilistic model which incorporates some
multiplicative structure and as a result captures the Graham-Ringrose
phenomenon. We prove that if we sample such a random graph independently for
every prime, then almost surely (i) for infinitely many primes $p$ the clique
number is $\Omega(\log p\log\log p)$, whilst (ii) for almost all primes the
clique number is $(2+o(1))\log p$.

physics properties and customizing the objects AI and behavior by editing
scripts. The heterogeneity of the task usually translates to a workflow where a
team of people, experts on separate aspects, cooperate to edit the game level,
often working on the same objects (e.g.: a programmer working on the AI of a

collaboration is established by using version control systems designed for text
documents, such as Git, to manage different versions and share them amongst

arms, which are observed in polarized radio synchrotron emission and are
located between the optical arms and possibly are magnetic reconnection
regions. X-ray observations of NGC6946 performed with XMM-Newton were used to
study the emission from X-ray point sources and diffuse hot gas, including the
magnetic arms and the halo. Spectral fitting of the diffuse X-ray emission
allowed us to derive temperatures of the hot gas. With assumptions about the
emission volume, this allowed us to estimate gas densities, masses, and cooling
times. To explain the X-ray emission from the spiral arms of NGC6946
two-temperature plasma models are needed to account for the disk and halo
emission. The interarm regions show only one thermal component. We observe that
the temperature of the hot gas in and above the magnetic arm regions increases
slightly when compared to the average temperatures in the areas in and above
the spiral arms. For the southwestern part of the disk, which is depolarized in
the radio range by Faraday rotation, we find more efficient mixing of disk and
halo gas. We propose magnetic reconnection in the magnetic arm regions of
NGC6946 as the possible cause of the additional heating of the gas and ordering
of the magnetic fields. In the southwestern part of the galactic disk we
observed indications of a possible faster outflow of the hot gas. A very hot

dredge-up to the stellar surface depending on progenitor mass and metallicity.
When the mass loss increases at the end of the AGB, a circumstellar dust shell
is formed, where different (C-rich or O-rich) molecules and solid-state
compounds are formed. These are further processed in the transition phase
between AGB stars and planetary nebulae (PNe) to create more complex organic
molecules and inorganic solid-state compounds (e.g., polycyclic aromatic
hydrocarbons, fullerenes, and graphene precursors in C-rich environments and
oxides and crystalline silicates in O-rich ones). We present an observational
review of the different molecules and solid-state materials that are formed
from the AGB to the PN phases. We focus on the formation routes of complex
fullerene (and fullerene-based) molecules as well as on the level of dust
processing depending on metallicity.

breaking with some details of the analysis involved. The model in the simplest
version has only a chiral superfield (multiplet), with a strong four-superfield
interaction in the K\""ahler potential that induces a real two-superfield
composite with vacuum condensate. The latter has supersymmetry breaking parts,
which we show to bear nontrivial solution following basically a standard
nonperturbative analysis for a Nambu--Jona-Lasinio type model on a superfield
setting. The real composite superfield has a spin one component but is
otherwise quite unconventional. We discuss also the parallel analysis for the
effective theory with the composite. Plausible vacuum solutions are illustrated
and analyzed. The supersymmetry breaking solutions have generated soft mass(es)
for the scalar avoiding the vanishing supertrace condition for the
squared-masses of the superfield components. We also present some analysis of
the resulted low energy effective theory with components of the composite
become dynamical. The determinant of the fermionic modes is shown to be zero
illustrating the presence of the expected Goldstino. The model gives the
possibility of constructing a supersymmetric standard model with all
(super)symmetry breaking masses generated dynamically and directly without the
necessity of complicated hidden or mediating sectors.

candidate for emission of very-high-energy (VHE > 100 GeV) pulsed gamma rays.
Also, detection of a large nebula have been claimed by water Cherenkov
instruments. We performed deep observations of Geminga with the MAGIC
telescopes, yielding 63 hours of good-quality data, and searched for emission
from the pulsar and pulsar wind nebula. We did not find any significant
detection, and derived 95% confidence level upper limits. The resulting upper
limits of 5.3 x 10^{-13} TeV cm^{-2} s^{-1} for the Geminga pulsar and 3.5 x
10^{-12} TeV cm^{-2} s^{-1} for the surrounding nebula at 50 GeV are the most
constraining ones obtained so far at VHE. To complement the VHE observations,
we also analyzed 5 years of Fermi-LAT data from Geminga, finding that the
sub-exponential cut-off is preferred over the exponential cut-off that has been
typically used in the literature. We also find that, above 10 GeV, the
gamma-ray spectra from Geminga can be described with a power law with index
softer than 5. The extrapolation of the power-law Fermi-LAT pulsed spectra to
VHE goes well below the MAGIC upper limits, indicating that the detection of
pulsed emission from Geminga with the current generation of Cherenkov
telescopes is very difficult.

  Therefore uncertainty assessment methods are required that take all relevant
aspects into account. In the literature this is scarcely performed and examples
specific for parameters used in friction and wear are not yet given.
  We propose a procedure to derive the uncertainty from a single profile
employing a statistical method that is based on the statistical moments of the
amplitude distribution and the autocorrelation length of the profile. To show
the possibilities and the limitations of this method we compare the uncertainty
derived from a single profile with that derived from a high statistics
experiment.

challenging problems, and has recently been extended to handle large neural
network policies and value functions. However, the sample complexity of
model-free algorithms, particularly when using high-dimensional function
approximators, tends to limit their applicability to physical systems. In this
paper, we explore algorithms and representations to reduce the sample
complexity of deep reinforcement learning for continuous control tasks. We
propose two complementary techniques for improving the efficiency of such
algorithms. First, we derive a continuous variant of the Q-learning algorithm,
which we call normalized adantage functions (NAF), as an alternative to the
more commonly used policy gradient and actor-critic methods. NAF representation
allows us to apply Q-learning with experience replay to continuous tasks, and
substantially improves performance on a set of simulated robotic control tasks.
To further improve the efficiency of our approach, we explore the use of
learned models for accelerating model-free reinforcement learning. We show that
iteratively refitted local linear models are especially effective for this, and
demonstrate substantially faster learning on domains where such models are
applicable.

magnetic field plane formed by the components parallel and perpendicular to the
helical axis is thoroughly analyzed. The nature of the transition to the
commensurate state depends on the angle between the field and the helical axis.
For field directions close to the directions parallel or perpendicular to the
helical axis the transition is continuous, while for intermediate angles the
transition is discontinuous and the incommensurate and commensurate states
coexist on the transition line. The continuous and discontinuous transition
lines are separated by two tricritical points with specific singular behaviour.
The location of the continuous and discontinuous lines and of the tricritical
points depend strongly on the easy-plane anisotropy, the effect of which is
analyzed. For large anisotropy the conical approximation locates the transition
line very accurately, although it does not predict the continuous transitions
nor the tricitical behaviour. It is shown that for large anisotropy, as in
CrNb3S6, the form of the transition line is universal, that is, independent of

that appear frequently in the list. In sub-polynomial space, the strongest
guarantee available is the $\ell_2$ guarantee, which requires finding all items
that occur at least $\epsilon\|f\|_2$ times in the stream, where the vector
$f\in\mathbb{R}^n$ is the count histogram of the stream with $i$th coordinate

algorithm to achieve the $\ell_2$ guarantee was the CountSketch of [CCF04],
which requires $O(\epsilon^{-2}\log n)$ words of memory and $O(\log n)$ update
time and is known to be space-optimal if the stream allows for deletions. The
recent work of [BCIW16] gave an improved algorithm for insertion-only streams,
using only $O(\epsilon^{-2}\log\epsilon^{-1}\log\log n)$ words of memory. In

$\|f\|_2$ at all times with $O(\epsilon^{-2})$ memory and update time. Our

(Istiophorus platypterus) alternate attacks with other group members on their
schooling prey (Sardinella aurita). While only 24% of attacks result in prey
capture, multiple prey are injured in 95% of attacks, resulting in an increase
of injured fish in the school with the number of attacks. How quickly prey are
captured is positively correlated with the level of injury of the school,
suggesting that hunters can benefit from other conspecifics' attacks on the
prey. To explore this, we built a mathematical model capturing the dynamics of
the hunt. We show that group hunting provides major efficiency gains (prey
caught per unit time) for individuals in groups of up to 70 members. We also
demonstrate that a free riding strategy, where some individuals wait until the
prey are sufficiently injured before attacking, is only beneficial if the cost
of attacking is high, and only then when waiting times are short. Our findings
provide evidence that cooperative benefits can be realised through the
facilitative effects of individuals' hunting actions without spatial
coordination of attacks. Such ""proto-cooperation"" may be the pre-cursor to more
complex group-hunting strategies.

paramount importance since the CDS of a country proxy its health and
probability to default, being associated to an insurance against the event of
its default. We fit the Benford's law to the daily changes in sovereign CDS
spreads for 13 European countries, - both inside and outside the European Union
and European Monetary Union. Two different tenors for the sovereign CDS
contracts are considered: 5 yrs and 10 yrs, - the former being the reference
and most liquid one. The time period under investigation is 2008-2015 which
includes the period of distress caused by the European sovereign debt crisis.
Moreover, (i) an analysis over relevant sub-periods is carried out, (ii)
several insights are provided also by implementing the tracking of the

elaborations based on Chebyshev's distance and Kullback and Leibler's

higher levels of distortion. Greece - representing a peculiar case - shows a

Klein-Gordon and Dirac equations for tachyons, recognizing that the mass shell
for such fields is very different from what we are used to for ordinary (slower
than light) particles. We find that we can postulate commutation or
anticommutation rules for the operators that lead to physically sensible
results: causality, for tachyon fields, means that there is no connection
between spacetime points separated by a timelike interval. Calculating the
conserved charge and 4-momentum for these fields allows us to interpret the
number operators for particles and antiparticles in a consistent manner; and we
see that helicity plays a critical role for the spinor field. Some questions
about Lorentz invariance are addressed and some remain unresolved; and we show
how to handle the group representation for tachyon spinors.

surface (IACS) must be crossed by inflowing plasma. Inside the IACS, Alfven
waves are inward directed toward the black hole. The majority of the proper
volume of the active region of spacetime (the ergosphere) is inside of the
IACS. The charge and the totally transverse momentum flux (the momentum flux
transverse to both the wave normal and the unperturbed magnetic field) are both
determined exclusively by the Alfven polarization. Thus, it is important for
numerical simulations of black hole magnetospheres to minimize the dissipation
of Alfven waves. Elements of the dissipated wave emerge in adjacent cells
regardless of the IACS, there is no mechanism to prevent Alfvenic information
from crossing outward. Thus, numerical dissipation can affect how simulated
magnetospheres attain the substantial Goldreich-Julian charge density
associated with the rotating magnetic field. In order to help minimize
dissipation of Alfven waves in relativistic numerical simulations we have
formulated a one-dimensional Riemann solver, called HLLI, which incorporates
the Alfven discontinuity and the contact discontinuity. We have also formulated
a multidimensional Riemann solver, called MuSIC, that enables low dissipation
propagation of Alfven waves in multiple dimensions. The importance of higher
order schemes in lowering the numerical dissipation of Alfven waves is also
catalogued.

imaging technique for high space-bandwidth product imaging. Mathematically,
Fourier ptychographic (FP) reconstruction can be implemented as a phase
retrieval optimization process, in which we only obtain low resolution
intensity images corresponding to the sub-bands of the sample's high resolution
(HR) spatial spectrum, and aim to retrieve the complex HR spectrum. In real
setups, the measurements always suffer from various degenerations such as
Gaussian noise, Poisson noise, speckle noise and pupil location error, which
would largely degrade the reconstruction. To efficiently address these
degenerations, we propose a novel FP reconstruction method under a gradient
descent optimization framework in this paper. The technique utilizes Poisson
maximum likelihood for better signal modeling, and truncated Wirtinger gradient
for error removal. Results on both simulated data and real data captured using
our laser FPM setup show that the proposed method outperforms other
state-of-the-art algorithms. Also, we have released our source code for
non-commercial use.

consistently equated with a homogeneous form of arbitrary dimension possessing
both spacetime and more general symmetries. An extended 4-dimensional manifold,
with the associated spacetime symmetry, provides a natural breaking mechanism

this symmetry breaking leads to a series of distinct properties of the Standard

progressive accumulation of a large number of frames, each containing a scarce
number of super-resolved point images. We justify that the redundancy in the
localization of detected events imposes a specific limit on the temporal
resolution. Based on a theoretical model, we derive analytical predictions for
the minimal time required to obtain a reliable image at a given spatial
resolution, called image completion time. In contrast to standard assumptions,
we find that the image completion time scales logarithmically with the ratio of
the image size by the spatial resolution volume. We justify that this
non-linear relation is the hallmark of a random coverage problem. We propose a
method to estimate the risk that the image reconstruction is not complete,
which we apply to an experimental data set. Our results provide a theoretical
framework to quantify the pattern detection efficiency and to optimize the
trade-off between image coverage and acquisition time, with applications to
$1$, $2$ or $3$ dimension structural imaging.
