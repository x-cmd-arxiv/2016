controllers for stochastic linear systems with bounded controls. The stochastic
noise in the plant is assumed to be additive, zero mean and fourth moment
bounded, and the control values transmitted over an erasure channel. Three
different transmission protocols are proposed having different requirements on
the storage and computational facilities available at the actuator. We optimize
a suitable stochastic cost function accounting for the effects of both the
stochastic noise and the packet dropouts over affine saturated disturbance
feedback policies. The proposed controllers ensure mean square boundedness of
the states in closed-loop for all positive values of control bounds and any
non-zero probability of successful transmission over a noisy control channel.

engineer the refraction properties in both optical and acoustic media.
Metasurfaces are typically designed by assembling arrays of sub-wavelength
anisotropic scatterers able to mold incoming wavefronts in rather
unconventional ways. The concept of metasurface was pioneered in photonics and
later extended to acoustics while its application to the propagation of elastic
waves in solids is relatively unexplored. We investigate the design of acoustic
metasurfaces to control elastic guided waves in thin-walled structural
elements. These engineered discontinuities enable anomalous refraction of
guided wave modes consistently with the generalized Snell's law. The
metasurfaces are made out of locally-resonant torus-like tapers enabling
accurate phase shift of the incoming wave which ultimately affects the
refraction properties. We show that anomalous refraction can be achieved on
transmitted antisymmetric modes ($A_0$) either when using a symmetric ($S_0$)
or antisymmetric ($A_0$) incident wave, the former clearly involving mode
conversion. The same metasurface design also allows achieving structure
embedded planar focal lenses and phase masks for non-paraxial propagation.

Simulation with such systems is expensive so one usually obtains a reduced

original full model. A recently proposed algorithm for model reduction of
bilinear dynamical systems, Bilinear Iterative Rational Krylov Algorithm
(BIRKA), does so in a locally optimal way. This algorithm requires solving very
large linear systems of equations. Usually these systems are solved by direct
methods (e.g., LU), which are very expensive. A better choice is iterative
methods (e.g., Krylov). However, iterative methods introduce errors in linear
solves because they are not exact. They solve the given linear system up to a
certain tolerance. We prove that under some mild assumptions BIRKA is stable

analyze the accuracy of the reduced system obtained from using these inexact

and environmental properties in the de-biased sample is modelled within an HBM
framework using the so-called logistic regression technique, suitable for the
analysis of binary data (e.g., whether or not a galaxy hosts an AGN). Unlike
standard ordinary least square fitting methods, our methodology naturally
allows modelling the probability of Seyfert-AGN activity in galaxies on their
natural scale, i.e. as a binary variable. Furthermore, we demonstrate how an
HBM can incorporate information of each particular galaxy morphological type in
a unified framework. In elliptical galaxies, our analysis indicates a strong
correlation of Seyfert-AGN activity with $r/r_{200}$, and a weaker correlation
with the mass of the host. In spiral galaxies these trends do not appear,
suggesting that the link between Seyfert activity and the properties of spiral
galaxies are independent of the environment.

larger mean radial velocity than the old population by about 3\,km$\rm s^{-1}$

matches the performance of pooling data and using a traditional algorithm. But
our algorithm also guarantees that adding users never significantly degrades

classes of low-mass stars (from M to A-type stars) has been discovered. In such
systems, the dissipation of the kinetic energy of tidal flows in the host star
may modify its rotational evolution and shape the orbital architecture of the
surrounding planetary system. In this context, recent works demonstrated that
the amplitude of this dissipation can vary over several orders of magnitude as
a function of stellar mass, age and rotation. In addition, the stellar rotation
evolution strongly impacts angular momentum exchanges within star-planet
systems. Therefore, it is now necessary to take into account the structural and
rotational evolution of stars when studying the orbital evolution of close-in
planets. The presence of planets may also modify the rotation of the host stars
and as a consequence their evolution, magnetic activity and mixing. In this
work, we present the first study of the dynamics of close-in planets of various
masses orbiting low-mass stars (from $0.6$ to $1.2~M_\star$) where we compute
the simultaneous evolution of the star's structure, rotation and tidal
dissipation in its external convective enveloppe. We find that tidal friction
due to the stellar dynamical tide, i.e. tidal inertial waves excited in the
convection zone, can be larger by several orders of magnitude than the one of
the equilibrium tide, especially during the PMS phase. Consequently, the
orbital migration of the planet is now more pronounced and depends more on the
stellar mass, rotation and age. This would very weakly affect the planets in
the habitable zone because they are located at orbital distances such that
stellar tide-induced migration happens on very long timescales. We also
demonstrate that the rotational evolution of host stars is only weakly affected
by the presence of planets except for massive companions.

a method is proposed to test whether a laser field is in a coherent state over
a given time by simply measuring the VBS output populations with an on-off
single-photon detector. Unfortunately, timing limitations of present technology
prohibit such simple tests, but the technique may become practical in the

of the way in which the probability amplitudes of distinguishable particles in

element formulation of the Electroencephalography (EEG) forward problem.
Boundary integral formulations, classically solved with the Boundary Element
Method (BEM), are widely used in high resolution EEG imaging because of their
recognized advantages in several real case scenarios. Unfortunately however, it
is widely reported that the accuracy of standard BEM schemes is limited,
especially when the current source density is dipolar and its location
approaches one of the brain boundary surfaces. This is a particularly limiting
problem given that during an high-resolution EEG imaging procedure, several EEG
forward problem solutions are required for which the source currents are near
or on top of a boundary surface.
  This work will first present an analysis of standardly discretized EEG
forward problems, reporting on a theoretical issue of some of the formulations
that have been used so far in the community. We report on the fact that several
standardly used discretizations requires the expansion term to be a square
integrable function. Instead, those techniques are not consistent when a more
appropriate mapping is considered. Such a mapping allows the expansion function
term to be a less regular function, thus sensibly reducing the need for mesh
refinements and low-precisions handling strategies that are currently required.
These mappings, however, require a different and conforming discretization
which must be suitably adapted to them. To do this we adopt a mixed
discretization based on dual boundary elements residing on a suitably defined
dual mesh. Finally we show how the resulting EEG problems has favorable
properties with respect to previously proposed schemes and we show their
applicability to real case modeling scenarios obtained from MRI data.

established, and yet arguably are still relatively little used by researchers.

standard statistical packages to perform such Bayesian analyses. In this paper
we first give an overview of the Bayesian approach to handling covariate
measurement error, and contrast it with regression calibration (RC), arguably
the most commonly adopted approach. We then argue why the Bayesian approach has
a number of statistical advantages compared to RC, and demonstrate that
implementing the Bayesian approach is usually quite feasible for the analyst.
Next we describe the closely related maximum likelihood and multiple imputation
approaches, and explain why we believe the Bayesian approach to generally be
preferable. We then empirically compare the frequentist properties of RC and
the Bayesian approach through simulation studies. The flexibility of the
Bayesian approach to handle both measurement error and missing data is then
illustrated through an analysis of data from the Third National Health and

transition, connects two approximately linear regimes. It is often assigned to
the dynamical freezing of subsets of molecular modes at the point of equality
between their corresponding relaxation times and the instrumental observation
window. The origin of the dynamical transition in glass-forming glycerol is
studied here by extensive molecular dynamics simulations. We find the dynamical
transition to occur for both the center of mass translations and the molecular
rotations at the same temperature, insensitive to changes of the observation
window. Both the translational and rotational dynamics of glycerol show a
dynamic crossover from the structural to a secondary relaxation at the
temperature of the dynamical transition. A significant and discontinuous
increase in the orientational Kirkwood factor and in the dielectric constant is
observed in the same range of temperatures. We, however, do not find any
indications of a true thermodynamic transition to an ordered low-temperature
phase. We therefore suggest that all observed crossovers are dynamic in
character. The increase in the dielectric constant is related to the dynamic
freezing of dipolar domains on the time-scale of simulations.

In the case that each entry of the $n$-dimensional $k$-sparse signal lies in a

measurements and arithmetic operations. In the case of arbitrary, possibly
continuous alphabet, an error propagation graph is proposed to characterize the

complexity, the reconstruction error can be made arbitrarily small with high

their asymptotic behaviour in terms of large deviation functions is calculated
explicitly, including next-to-leading terms up to order 1/N. We demonstrate a
split-off phenomenon associated to atypical fluctuations of the edge density

popular JavaScript programs (JS) in Web browsers. Such blocking also affects
functionality of webpages and impairs user experience. As a consequence, many
privacy preserving tools (PP-Tools) that have been developed to limit online
tracking, often executed via JS, may suffer from poor performance and limited
uptake. A mechanism that can isolate JS necessary for proper functioning of the
website from tracking JS would thus be useful. Through the use of a manually
labelled dataset composed of 2,612 JS, we show how current PP-Tools are
ineffective in finding the right balance between blocking tracking JS and
allowing functional JS. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study
to assess the performance of current web PP-Tools.
  To improve this balance, we examine the two classes of JS and hypothesize
that tracking JS share structural similarities that can be used to
differentiate them from functional JS. The rationale of our approach is that
web developers often borrow and customize existing pieces of code in order to
embed tracking (resp. functional) JS into their webpages. We then propose
one-class machine learning classifiers using syntactic and semantic features
extracted from JS. When trained only on samples of tracking JS, our classifiers
achieve an accuracy of 99%, where the best of the PP-Tools achieved an accuracy
of 78%.
  We further test our classifiers and several popular PP-Tools on a corpus of
4K websites with 135K JS. The output of our best classifier on this data is
between 20 to 64% different from the PP-Tools. We manually analyse a sample of
the JS for which our classifier is in disagreement with all other PP-Tools, and
show that our approach is not only able to enhance user web experience by
correctly classifying more functional JS, but also discovers previously unknown
tracking services.

central void galaxies with M*>10^10 Msun using the Wide Field Spectrograph
(WiFeS) to determine how a range of assembly histories manifest themselves in
the current day Universe. While the majority of these galaxies are evolving
secularly, we find a range of morphologies, merger histories and stellar
population distributions, though similarly low Halpha-derived star formation
rates (<1 Msun/yr). Two of our nine galaxies host AGNs, and two have kinematic
disruptions to their gas that are not seen in their stellar component. Most
massive void galaxies are red and discy, which we attribute to a lack of major
mergers. Some have disturbed morphologies and may be in the process of evolving
to early-type thanks to ongoing minor mergers at present times, likely fed by
tendrils leading off filaments. The diversity in our small galaxy sample,
despite being of similar mass and environment means that these galaxies are
still assembling at present day, with minor mergers playing an important role
in their evolution.
  We compare our sample to a mass and magnitude-matched sample of field
galaxies, using data from the Sydney-AAO Multi-object Integral field
spectrograph (SAMI) galaxy survey. We find that despite environmental
differences, galaxies of mass M*>10^10 Msun have similarly low star formation
rates (<3 Msun/yr). The lack of distinction between the star formation rates of
the void and field environments points to quenching of massive galaxies being a
largely mass-related effect.

tremendous importance from a structural health monitoring and nondestructive

characterize and localize damage by detecting the attenuation, reflection, and
scattering of stress waves that occurs at damage locations. This can ultimately
lead to the development of new SHM/NDE methods for identifying hidden cracks or
delaminations in metallic or composite plate structures simultaneously negating

control problems in which the cost function and the system dynamics are
polynomial. For stochastic systems with polynomial dynamics, the moments of the
state can be expressed as a, possibly infinite, system of deterministic linear
ordinary differential equations. By casting the problem as a deterministic
control problem in moment space, semidefinite programming is used to find a
lower bound on the optimal solution. The constraints in the semidefinite
program are imposed by the ordinary differential equations for moment dynamics
and semidefiniteness of the outer product of moments. From the solution to the
semidefinite program, an approximate optimal control strategy can be
constructed using a least squares method. In the linear quadratic case, the
method gives an exact solution to the optimal control problem. In more complex
problems, an infinite number of moment differential equations would be required
to compute the optimal control law. In this case, we give a procedure to
increase the size of the semidefinite program, leading to increasingly accurate

potential to shorten the package delivery time and improve the efficiency of
the e-commerce industry. In this paper, we present a robotic system that is
capable of both picking and placing general objects in warehouse scenarios.
Given a target object, the robot autonomously detects it from a shelf or a
table and estimates its full 6D pose. With this pose information, the robot
picks the object using its gripper, and then places it into a container or at a
specified location. We describe our pick-and-place system in detail while
highlighting our design principles for the warehouse settings, including the
perception method that leverages knowledge about its workspace, three grippers
designed to handle a large variety of different objects in terms of shape,
weight and material, and grasp planning in cluttered scenarios. We also present
extensive experiments to evaluate the performance of our picking system and
demonstrate that the robot is competent to accomplish various tasks in
warehouse settings, such as picking a target item from a tight space, grasping
different objects from the shelf, and performing pick-and-place tasks on the
table.

The DeSCA first computes self-convolutions over a local support window for

performing an average pooling through a hierarchical formulation within a deep
convolutional architecture. Finally, the feature responses on the
self-convolution activations are encoded through a spatial pyramid pooling in a

imaging, and can be densely computed in an efficient manner that significantly
reduces computational redundancy. The state-of-the-art performance of DeSCA on
challenging cases of cross-modal image pairs is demonstrated through extensive

their low energy electronic properties in finite-length. The classification is
given by an integer $d$, which is the greatest common divisor of two integers
$n$ and $m$ specifying the chirality of nanotubes, by analyzing cutting lines.
For the case that $d$ is equal to or greater than four, two lowest subbands
from two valleys have different angular momenta with respect to the nanotube
axis. Reflecting the decoupling of two valleys, discrete energy levels in
finite-length nanotubes exhibit nearly fourfold degeneracy and its small lift
by the spin-orbit interaction. For the case that $d$ is less than or equal to
two, in which two lowest subbands from two valleys have the same angular
momentum, discrete levels exhibit lift of fourfold degeneracy reflecting the
coupling of two valleys. Especially, two valleys are strongly coupled when the
chirality is close to the armchair chirality. An effective one-dimensional
lattice model is derived by extracting states with relevant angular momentum,
which reveals the valley coupling in the eigenstates. A bulk-edge
correspondence, relationship between number of edge states and the winding

spontaneous formation of amyloid fibrils or polymers. The starting point of
this phase, called nucleation exhibits an important variability among
replicated experiments.To analyse the stochastic nature of this phenomenon, one
of the simplest models considers two populations of chemical components:
monomers and polymerised monomers. Initially there are only monomers. There are
two reactions for the polymerization of a monomer: either two monomers collide
to combine into two polymerised monomers or a monomer is polymerised after the
encounter of a polymerised monomer. It turns out that this simple model does
not explain completely the variability observed in the experiments. This paper
investigates extensions of this model to take into account other mechanisms of
the polymerization process that may have impact an impact on fluctuations.The
first variant consists in introducing a preliminary conformation step to take
into account the biological fact that, before being polymerised, a monomer has
two states, regular or misfolded. Only misfolded monomers can be polymerised so
that the fluctuations of the number of misfolded monomers can be also a source
of variability of the number of polymerised monomers. The second variant
represents the reaction rate $\alpha$ of spontaneous formation of a polymer as
of the order of $N^{-\nu}$, with $\nu$ some positive constant. First and second
order results for the starting instant of nucleation are derived from these
limit theorems. The proofs of the results rely on a study of a stochastic
averaging principle for a model related to an Ehrenfest urn model, and also on
a scaling analysis of a population model.

applications, the variable exponent can approach the critical value $1$, and
this poses unique challenges in proving existence of solutions, which have not
been mastered earlier. In this work, we develop some additional functional
framework to study the time-dependent parabolic flows with critical variable
exponents. Specifically, we consider bounded vectorial partial variation (BVPV)
space and its variable exponent counterpart. We prove the existence of weak

vectorial $p(x)$-Laplacian flow we obtain a semigroup solution. The results are

activation likelihood estimation to meta-analyze 257 peak foci from 31

of brain activation and deactivation for four common styles of meditation
(focused attention, mantra recitation, open monitoring, and
compassion/loving-kindness), and suggestive differences for three others
(visualization, sense-withdrawal, and non-dual awareness practices). Overall,
dissociable activation patterns are congruent with the psychological and
behavioral aims of each practice. Some brain areas are recruited consistently
across multiple techniques - including insula, pre/supplementary motor
cortices, dorsal anterior cingulate cortex, and frontopolar cortex - but
convergence is the exception rather than the rule. A preliminary effect-size

research area because both information and energy can be delivered to wireless

after the mixer. The baseband signals are used for information decoding and the
doubling frequency signals are converted to direct current for energy
harvesting. We analyze the signal in the receiver and find that the power of

formulated as an optimization problem that minimizes the total transmitted
power subject to some constraints on each user's quality of service and energy

from single-image input. The two tasks are formulated in a synergistic manner
through a joint conditional random field (CRF) that is solved using a novel
convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture, called the joint convolutional

differs from previous CNNs in its sharing of convolutional activations and
layers between networks for each task, its inference in the gradient domain
where there exists greater correlation between depth and intrinsic images, and
the incorporation of a gradient scale network that learns the confidence of
estimated gradients in order to effectively balance them in the solution. This
approach is shown to surpass state-of-the-art methods both on single-image

phase diagram contains a Chiral Soliton Lattice phase and a forced
ferromagnetic phase separated by a line of phase transitions, which are of
second order at low T and of first order in the vicinity of the zero-field

linear Chiral Soliton Lattice, in which many harmonics contribute appreciably
to the spatial modulation of the local magnetic moment, develops only below the
tricritical temperature, and in this case the scaling shows a logarithmic
behaviour similar to that at T=0, which is a universal feature of the Chiral
Soliton Lattice. Below the tricritical temperature, the normalized soliton

Therefore, by simultaneously fitting the X-ray and lensing profiles of galaxy

using path integral methods. Explicit relationships are derived for commonly
employed gradient waveforms involving pulsed and oscillating gradients. The
Bloch-Torrey equation, describing the temporal evolution of magnetization, is
modified by incorporating potentials. A general solution to this equation is
obtained for the case of parabolic potential by adopting the multiple
correlation function (MCF) formalism, which has been used in the past to
quantify the effects of restricted diffusion. Both analytical and MCF results
were found to be in agreement with random walk simulations. A multi-dimensional
formulation of the problem is introduced that leads to a new characterization
of diffusion anisotropy. Unlike for the case of traditional methods that employ
a diffusion tensor, anisotropy originates from the tensorial force constant,
and bulk diffusivity is retained in the formulation. Our findings suggest that
some features of the NMR signal that have traditionally been attributed to
restricted diffusion are accommodated by the Hookean model. Under certain

existence of the nA clouds is $i)$ a large enough gauge group and $ii)$ the
presence of some extra interaction terms in the matter Lagrangian. To
illustrate this mechanism we present two specific examples, one in four and the
other in five dimensional asymptotically flat spacetime. In the first case, we
augment the usual $SU(3)$ Yang-Mills Lagrangian with higher order (quartic)
curvature term, while for the second one we add the Chern-Simons density to the
$SO(6)$ Yang-Mills system. In both cases, an Abelian gauge symmetry is
spontaneously broken near a RN black hole horizon with the appearance of a
condensate of nA gauge fields. In addition to these two examples, we review the
corresponding picture for anti-de Sitter black holes. All these solutions are
studied both analytically and numerically, existence proofs being provided for
nA clouds in the background of RN black holes. The proofs use shooting
techniques which are suggested by and in turn offer insights for our numerical
methods. They indicate that, for a black hole of given mass, appropriate
electric charge values are required to ensure the existence of solutions
interpolating desired boundary behavior at the horizons and spatial infinity.

circumvent this difficulty by proposing a change-of-variables approach to CMC,

causing bright ultraviolet (UV) and extreme ultraviolet (EUV) splashes across
the surface. These impacts may give clues on the process of stellar accretion.
The aim is to investigate how the impact emission is influenced by structures
in the falling ejecta and at the solar surface. We determine the UV and EUV
light curves of a sample of impacts. The ballistic impact velocity is estimated
from the ejection and landing times and, where possible, compared with the
velocity derived by tracking the downflows in SDO/AIA and STEREO/EUVI images.
Estimates of the column density before impact are made from the darkness of the
falling plasma in the 193 A channel. The impact velocities were between 230 and
450 km/s. All impacts produced bright EUV emission at the impact site but
bright UV was only observed when the impacting fragments reached the
chromosphere. There was no clear relation between EUV intensity and kinetic
energy. Low UV to EUV intensity ratios (I{UV}/I{EUV}) were seen (i) from
impacts of low column-density fragments, (ii) when splashes, produced by some
impacts, prevented subsequent fragments from reaching the chromosphere, and
(iii) from an impact in an active region. The earliest impacts with the lowest
velocity (~250 km/s) had the highest I{UV}/I{EUV}. The I{UV}/I{EUV} decreases
with impact velocity, magnetic field at the impact site, and EUV ionising flux.
Many of the infalling fragments dissipate above the chromosphere either due to
ionisation and trapping in magnetic structures, or to them encountering a
splash from an earlier impact. If the same happens in accreting stars then the
reduced X-ray compared to optical emission that has been observed is more
likely due to absorption by the trailing stream than locally at the impact
site.

the shadow of a black hole is affected due to the parameter $k$. Indeed, for a
given $a$, the size of a shadow reduces as the parameter $k$ increases and the
shadow becomes more distorted as we increase the value of the parameter $k$
when compared with the analogous Kerr black hole shadow. We also investigate,
in detail, how the ergoregion of a black hole is changed due to the deviation

different types of dynamics in terms of measures of complexity, dynamical
invariants, or even structural characteristics of the underlying attractor's
geometry in phase space. Here, we demonstrate that the latter approach also
provides a corresponding distinction between different co-existing dynamical
regimes of the standard map, a paradigmatic example of a low-dimensional
conservative system. Specifically, we show that the recently developed approach
of recurrence network analysis provides potentially useful geometric
characteristics distinguishing between regular and chaotic orbits. We find that
chaotic orbits in an intermittent laminar phase (commonly referred to as sticky
orbits) have a distinct geometric structure possibly differing in a subtle way
from those of regular orbits, which is highlighted by different recurrence
network properties obtained from relatively short time series. Thus, this
approach can help discriminating regular orbits from laminar phases of chaotic
ones, which presents a persistent challenge to many existing chaos detection
techniques.

We also discuss the ease, or otherwise, with which the results of each
classification technique can be interpreted. Non-parametric methods have the
potential to make accurate predictions when there are complex relationships
between critical parameters. We found that for the small datasets the
parametric methods logistic regression and LDA performed best, for the largest

accuracy to parametric techniques, rather than any significant improvement.
This suggests that at least for the specific examples investigated here

parametric models. We also found that for LDA, transformation of the data to
match a normal distribution in the input parameters led to big improvements in
accuracy. The different classification techniques had significant overlap in
their predictions, further astronomical observations will enable the accuracy

the appearance compatibility of the de-shadowed region as typically produced by
previous methods. It is based on a shadow-guided patch-based image synthesis
approach that reconstructs the shadow region using patches sampled from
non-shadowed regions. The result is then refined based on the reconstruction
confidence to handle unique image patterns. Many shadow removal results and
comparisons are show the effectiveness of our improvement. Quantitative
evaluation on a benchmark dataset suggests that our automatic shadow
harmonization approach effectively improves upon the state-of-the-art.

Lorentz-covariant fashion in the sense of 11 dimesnional flat Minkowski
space-time, from the viewpoint of the so-called DLCQ interpretation of the
light-front Matrix theory. The theory is characterized by various symmetry
properties including higher gauge symmetries, which contain the usual SU($N$)
symmetry as a special case and are extended from the structure naturally
appearing in association with a discretized version of Nambu's 3-bracket. The
theory is scale invariant, and the emergence of the 11 dimensional
gravitational length, or M-theory scale, is interpreted as a consequence of a
breaking of the scaling symmetry through a super-selection rule. In the
light-front gauge with the DLCQ compactification of 11 dimensions, the theory
reduces to the usual light-front formulation. In the time-like gauge with the
ordinary M-theory spatial compactification, it reduces to a non-Abelian
Born-Infeld-like theory, which in the limit of large $N$ becomes equivalent
with the original BFSS theory.

other studies of three-dimensional weak lensing extending to smaller scales is
compensated by the information that is gained if the additional iSW signal and
in particular its cross-correlation with lensing data are considered. Given the
observational standards of upcoming weak lensing surveys like Euclid, marginal
errors on cosmological parameters decrease by ten per cent compared to a cosmic

reddened ($E(B-V)\simeq$0.5-1.9), hyperluminous
($log(L_{bol}/ergs^{-1})\simeq$47-48) broad-line quasars at $z\simeq$1.4-2.7.
Sixteen of the 28 quasars show evidence for star formation with an average
extinction-corrected star formation rate (SFR) of 320$\pm$70M$_\odot$yr$^{-1}$.
A stacked spectrum of the detections shows weak [NII], consistent with star
formation as the origin of the narrow H$\alpha$ emission. The star-forming
regions are spatially unresolved in 11 of the 16 detections and constrained to
lie within $\sim$6kpc of the quasar emission. In the five resolved detections
we find the star-forming regions are extended on scales of $\sim$8kpc around
the quasar emission. The prevalence of high SFRs is consistent with the
identification of the heavily reddened quasar population as representing a
transitional phase from apparent `starburst galaxies' to optically-luminous
quasars. Upper limits are determined for 10 quasars in which star formation is
undetected. In two of the quasars the SFR is constrained to be relatively
modest, $<$50M$_\odot$yr$^{-1}$, but significantly higher levels of star
formation could be present in the other eight quasars. The combination of the
16 strong star formation detections and the eight high SFR limits means that
high levels of star formation may be present in the majority of the sample.
Higher spatial resolution data, of multiple emission lines, will allow us to
better understand the interplay between star formation and Active Galactic

checking. Solving parity games is computationally expensive, among others due

spectra of individual sources, calling for a large population, undetected so
far, of strongly obscured Compton thick AGN. Such objects are predicted by
unified models, which attribute most of the AGN diversity to their inclination
on the line of sight, and play an important role for the understanding of the
growth of black holes in the early Universe. The fraction of obscured AGN at
low redshift can be derived from the observed CXB spectrum assuming AGN
spectral templates and luminosity functions. We show that high signal-to-noise
average hard X-ray spectra, derived from more than a billion seconds of
effective exposure time with the Swift/BAT instrument, imply that mildly
obscured Compton thin AGN feature a strong reflection and contribute massively
to the CXB. A population of Compton thick AGN larger than that effectively
detected is not required, as no more than 6\% of the CXB flux can be attributed
to them. The stronger reflection observed in mildly obscured AGN suggests that
the covering fraction of the gas and dust surrounding their central engines is
a key factor in shaping their appearance. These mildly obscured AGN are easier

annotating many samples from the new domain would address this issue, it is
often too expensive or impractical. Domain Adaptation has therefore emerged as
a solution to this problem; It leverages annotated data from a source domain,
in which it is abundant, to train a classifier to operate in a target domain,
in which it is either sparse or even lacking altogether. In this context, the
recent trend consists of learning deep architectures whose weights are shared

features.
  Here, we show that it is more effective to explicitly model the shift from
one domain to the other. To this end, we introduce a two-stream architecture,
where one operates in the source domain and the other in the target domain. In

Understanding the cosmic evolution of dust with time is therefore crucial for
understanding the evolution of galaxies. Despite the importance of interstellar
dust, very little is known about its nature and composition in distant
galaxies. We summarize the results of our ongoing programs using observations
of distant quasars to obtain better constraints on dust grains in foreground
galaxies that happen to lie along the quasar sightlines. These observations
consist of a combination of mid-infrared data obtained with the Spitzer Space
Telescope and optical/UV data obtained with ground-based telescopes and/or the
Hubble Space Telescope. The mid-IR data target the 10 $\mu$m and 18 $\mu$m
silicate absorption features, while the optical/UV data allow determinations of
element depletions, extinction curves, 2175 {\AA} bumps, etc. Measurements of
such properties in absorption-selected galaxies with redshifts ranging from
$z\sim0$ to $z>2$ provide constraints on the evolution of interstellar dust
over the past $> 10$ Gyr. The optical depth of the 10 $\mu$m silicate
absorption feature ($\tau_{10}$) in these galaxies is correlated with the
amount of reddening along the sightline. But there are indications [e.g., based
on the $\tau_{10}$ /$E(B-V)$ ratio and possible grain crystallinity] that the
dust in these distant galaxies differs in structure and composition from the
dust in the Milky Way and the Magellanic Clouds. We briefly discuss the
implications of these results for the evolution of galaxies and their star
formation history.

self-induced transparency in the interaction of a circularly-polarized
laser-pulse with an overdense plasma and their relation to hole-boring and ion
acceleration. It is demonstrated using particle-in-cell simulations and an
analysis of separatrices in single-electron phase-space, that ion motion can
suppress fast electron escape to the vacuum, which would otherwise lead to
transition to the relativistic transparency regime. A simple analytical
estimate shows that for large laser pulse amplitude $a_0$ the time scale over
which ion motion becomes important is much shorter than usually anticipated. As
a result, the threshold density above which hole-boring occurs decreases with
the charge-to-mass ratio. Moreover, the transition threshold is seen to depend
on the laser temporal profile, due to the effect that the latter has on
electron heating. Finally, we report a new regime in which a transition from
relativistic transparency to hole-boring occurs dynamically during the course
of the interaction. It is shown that, for a fixed laser intensity, this dynamic
transition regime allows optimal ion acceleration in terms of both energy and
energy spread.

behavior (i.e., $E_G\simeq 500$ meV) under carefully specified conditions.
However, for the structures studied so far this behavior is critically
dependent on superlattice geometry and is not robust against experimentally
realistic disorders. Here we study a rectangular array of triangular antidots
with zigzag edge geometries and show that their band gap behavior qualitatively
differs from the standard behavior which is exhibited, e.g, by rectangular
arrays of armchair-edged triangles. In the spin unpolarized case, zigzag-edged
antidots give rise to large band gaps compared to armchair-edged antidots,
irrespective of the rules which govern the existence of gaps in armchair-edged
antidot lattices. In addition the zigzag-edged antidots appear more robust than
armchair-edged antidots in the presence of geometrical disorder. The inclusion
of spin polarization within a mean-field Hubbard approach gives rise to a large
overall magnetic moment at each antidot due to the sublattice imbalance imposed
by the triangular geometry. Half-metallic behavior arises from the formation of
spin-split dispersive states near the Fermi energy, reducing the band gaps
compared to the unpolarized case. This behavior is also found to be robust in
the presence of disorder. Our results highlight the possibilities of using
triangular perforations in graphene to open electronic band gaps in systems
with experimentally realistic levels of disorder, and furthermore, of
exploiting the strong spin dependence of the system for spintronic
applications.

multiple steady states? Mathematically, this asks: among certain parametrized
families of polynomial systems, which admit multiple positive roots? No
complete answer is known. This work analyzes the smallest networks, those with
only a few chemical species or reactions. For these ""smallest"" networks, we
completely answer the question of multistationarity and, in some cases,
multistability too, thereby extending related work of Boros. Our results
highlight the role played by the Newton polytope of a network (the convex hull
of the reactant vectors). Also, our work is motivated by recent results that
explain how a given network's capacity for multistationarity arises from that
of certain related networks which are typically smaller. Hence, we are

forward flow map can now be determined on the fly. Due to the simplicity in the
implementations, we are now able to efficiently compute the unstable coherent

infinitesimal size Lyapunov exponent (ISLE). When applied to the ISLE
computations, the Eulerian method is in particularly computationally efficient.
For each separation factor r in the definition of the ISLE, typical Lagrangian
methods require to shoot and monitor an individual set of ray trajectories. If
the scale factor in the definition is changed, these methods have to restart
the whole computations all over again. The proposed Eulerian method, however,
requires to extract only an isosurface of a volumetric data for an individual
value of r which can be easily done using any well-developed efficient
interpolation method or simply an isosurface extraction algorithm. Moreover, we
provide a theoretical link between the FTLE and the ISLE fields which explains
the similarity in these solutions observed in various applications.

through an analysis of its DC and AC spin susceptibilities. To account for the
easily activated narrow b2g-a1g gap of the crystal field for Co in the cobalt
oxide layer, the spin-state transition of Co3+ (3d6) between the low spin (LS)
state b2g^2-a1g^0 of S=0 and the intermediate spin (IS) state b2g^1-a1g^1 of
S=1 is thus seen as thermally activated and exhibits a Boltzmann distribution.
The IS state of Co3+ within each sqrt(13a) hexagonal superlattice formed by the
S=1/2 state of the Co4+ ions appears randomly within each supercell and shows
significant temperature and field dependence. The magnetic field is found to
assist in pinning down the thermally activated state of Co3+ and swings the
Boltzmann distribution weight toward a higher fraction of the IS state. The
field dependence of the in-plane magnetic moment from the added number of S=1
spins is used to explain the origin of A-type antiferromagnetic (AF) ordering,
particularly that the ferromagnetic (FM)-like behavior below TN at low field is
actually a ferrimagnetic IS spin ordering of Co3+.

durability assessments of vehicle components. By counting the number of driving
events, one can estimate the fatigue damage caused by the same kind of events.
Through knowledge of the distribution of driving events for a group of
customers, the vehicles producers can tailor the design, of vehicles, for the
group. In this article, we propose an algorithm that can be applied on-board a
vehicle to online estimate the expected number of driving events occurring, and
thus be used to estimate the distribution of driving events for a certain group
of customers. Since the driving events are not observed directly, the algorithm
uses a hidden Markov model to extract the events. The parameters of the HMM are
estimated using an online EM algorithm. The introduction of the online EM is
crucial for practical usage, on-board vehicles, due to that its complexity of
an iteration is fixed. Typically, the EM algorithm is used to find the, fixed,
parameters that maximizes the likelihood. By introducing a fixed forgetting
factor in the online EM, an adaptive algorithm is acquired. This is important
in practice since the driving conditions changes over time and a single trip
can contain different road types such as city and highway, making the
assumption of fixed parameters unrealistic. Finally, we also derive a method to
online compute the expected damage.

underlying plane wave coefficients. The core region is handled within the
projected augment wave framework, by pseudizing the Gaussian functions within a
cut-off radius around each nucleus, smoothing the functions so that they are
faithfully represented by a plane wave basis with only moderate kinetic energy

incompleteness at the mean-field level introduced by the Gaussian basis, we
also propose a hybrid approach, whereby the complete occupied space is first
converged within a large plane wave basis, and the Gaussian basis used to
construct a complementary virtual space for the application of correlated
methods. We demonstrate that these pseudized Gaussians yield compact and

phenomena in complex networks of diffusively-coupled nodes subject to external
disturbances. Specifically, we make use of stochastic Lyapunov functions to
provide conditions for synchronization and consensus for networks of nonlinear,
diffusively coupled nodes, where noise diffusion is not just additive but it
depends on the nodes' state. The sufficient condition we provide, wich links
together network topology, coupling strength and noise diffusion, offers two
interesting interpretations. First, as suggested by {\em intuition}, in order
for a network to achieve synchronization/consensus, its nodes need to be
sufficiently well connected together. The second implication might seem,
instead, counter-intuitive: if noise diffusion is {\em properly} designed, then
it can drive an unsynchronized network towards synchronization/consensus.
Motivated by our current research in Smart Cities and Internet of Things, we
illustrate the effectiveness of our approach by showing how our results can be
used to control certain collective decision processes.

battery systems will be installed in the distribution grid in near future to
mitigate voltage violations and thermal line and transformer overloading. In
this paper, we present a two-stage centralized model predictive control scheme
for distributed battery storage that consists of a scheduling entity and a
real-time control entity. To guarantee secure grid operation, we solve a robust
multi-period optimal power flow (OPF) for the scheduling stage that minimizes
battery degradation and maximizes photovoltaic utilization subject to grid
constraints. The real-time controller solves a real-time OPF taking into
account storage allocation profiles from the scheduler, a detailed battery
model, and real-time measurements. To reduce the computational complexity of
the controllers, we present a linearized OPF that approximates the nonlinear
AC-OPF into a linear programming problem. Through a case study, we show, for
two different battery technologies, that we can substantially reduce battery
degradation when we incorporate a battery degradation model. A further finding
is that we can reduce battery losses by 30% by using the detailed battery model
in the real-time control stage.

through the broad range of new approaches that commenced in the late 1950s, and
up to the transition of experimental gravity physics to what might be termed a
normal and accepted part of physical science in the late 1960s. This review
shows the importance of advances in technology, here as in all branches of
natural science. The role of contingency is illustrated by Robert Dicke's
decision in the mid-1950s to change directions in mid-career, to lead a
research group dedicated to the experimental study of gravity. The review also
shows the power of nonempirical evidence. Some in the 1950s felt that general
relativity theory is so logically sound as to be scarcely worth the testing.
But Dicke and others argued that a poorly tested theory is only that, and that
other nonempirical arguments, based on Mach's Principle and Dirac's Large
Numbers hypothesis, suggested it would be worth looking for a better theory of
gravity. I conclude by offering lessons from this history, some peculiar to the
study of gravity physics during the naissance, some of more general relevance.
The central lesson, which is familiar but not always well advertised, is that
physical theories can be empirically established, sometimes with surprising
results.

in the outskirts of some merging galaxy clusters. They are believed to trace
shock-waves in the intra-cluster medium. Recent observations demonstrated that
some prominent radio relics exhibit a steepening above 2 GHz in their radio
spectrum. This challenges standard theoretical models because shock
acceleration is expected to accelerate electrons to very high energies with a
power-law distribution in momentum. In this work we attempt to reconcile these
data with the shock-acceleration scenario. We propose that the spectral
steepening may be caused by the highest energy electrons emitting
preferentially in lower magnetic fields than the bulk of synchrotron bright
electrons in relics. Here, we focus on a model with an increasing mag- netic
field behind the shock front, which quickly saturates and then declines. We
derive the time-evolution of cosmic-ray electron spectra in time variable
magnetic fields and an expanding medium. We then apply the formalism on the
large radio relic in the cluster CIZA J2242.8+5301 (the Sausage relic). We show
that under favourable circumstances of magnetic field amplification downstream,
our model can explain the observed radio spectrum, the brightness profile and
the spectral index profile of the relic. A possible interpretation for the
required amplification of the magnetic field downstream is a dynamo acting
behind the shock with an injection scale of magnetic turbulence of about 10
kpc. Our models require injection efficiencies of CRe - which are in tension
with simple diffusive shock acceleration from the thermal pool. We show that
this problem can likely be alleviated considering pre-existing CRe.
