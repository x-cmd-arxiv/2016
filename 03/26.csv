is calculated both before and after the electroweak phase transition (EWPT).
The leptogenesis before EWPT within the standard model is well known to be
driven by the abelian anomaly in a massless hypercharge field. The generation
of the neutrino asymmetry in the Higgs phase after EWPT, in its turn, has not
been considered previously because of the absence of any quantum anomaly in an
external electromagnetic field for such electroneutral particles as neutrino,
unlike the Adler anomaly for charged left and right polarized massless
electrons in the same electromagnetic field. Using the neutrino Boltzmann
equation, modified by the Berry curvature term in the momentum space, we
establish the violation of the macroscopic neutrino current in plasma after
EWPT and exactly reproduce the nonconservation of the lepton current in the
symmetric phase before EWPT arising in quantum field theory due to the non-zero
lepton hypercharge and corresponding triangle anomaly in an external
hypercharge field. In the last case the violation of the lepton current is
derived through the kinetic approach without the computation of the
corresponding Feynman diagrams. Then the new kinetic equation is applied for
the calculation of the neutrino asymmetry accounting for the the Berry
curvature and the electroweak interaction with background fermions in the Higgs
phase, including the stage after the neutrino decoupling at the absence of
neutrino collisions in plasma. This asymmetry is found to be rather small to be
observed. Thus, a difference of the relic neutrino and antineutrino densities,
if exists, should be acquired mainly in the symmetric phase before EWPT.

develops new algorithms, and analyzes their performances. Packets arrive at a
release time r, with a non-negative weight w and an integer deadline d. At each
time step, at most one packet is scheduled. The modified greedy (MG) algorithm
is 1.618-competitive for the objective of maximizing the sum of weights of
packets sent, assuming agreeable deadlines. We analyze the empirical behavior
of MG in a situation with arbitrary deadlines and demonstrate that it is at a
disadvantage when frequently preferring maximum weight packets over early
deadline ones. We develop the MLP algorithm, which remedies this problem whilst
mimicking the behavior of the offline algorithm. Our comparative analysis shows
that, although the competitive ratio of MLP is not as good as that of MG, it
performs better in practice. We validate this by simulating the behavior of
both algorithms under a spectrum of simulated parameter settings. Finally, we
propose the design of three additional algorithms, which may help in improving
performance in practice.

gray-diffusion approximation. Both electron and ion conduction are included, as
well as ion viscosity. When the material is optically thin, three-temperature
behavior occurs. When the diffusive flux of radiation is important but

train highly effective deep convolutional neural network (CNN) models for image
recognition. Nevertheless, conventional methods for collecting image labels
(e.g., Google search followed by crowd-sourcing) are not applicable due to the
formidable difficulties of medical annotation tasks for those who are not
clinically trained. This type of image labeling task remains non-trivial even
for radiologists due to uncertainty and possible drastic inter-observer
variation or inconsistency.
  In this paper, we present a looped deep pseudo-task optimization procedure
for automatic category discovery of visually coherent and clinically semantic
(concept) clusters. Our system can be initialized by domain-specific (CNN
trained on radiology images and text report derived labels) or generic
(ImageNet based) CNN models. Afterwards, a sequence of pseudo-tasks are
exploited by the looped deep image feature clustering (to refine image labels)
and deep CNN training/classification using new labels (to obtain more task
representative deep features). Our method is conceptually simple and based on
the hypothesized ""convergence"" of better labels leading to better trained CNN
models which in turn feed more effective deep image features to facilitate more
meaningful clustering/labels. We have empirically validated the convergence and
demonstrated promising quantitative and qualitative results. Category labels of
significantly higher quality than those in previous work are discovered. This

maze problem is equivalent to the problem of finding a semiclassical trajectory
of some lattice field theory (the dual theory) on an N+1 dimensional space-time
with geometrically flat, but topologically compact spatial slices. The spatial
fundamental domain is an N dimensional hyper-rhombohedron, and the temporal
direction describes transitions from an arbitrary initial state to an arbitrary
target state. We first consider a complex Klein-Gordon field theory and argue
that it can only be used to study the shortest quantum circuits which do not
involve generators composed of tensor products of multiple Pauli Z matrices.
Since such situation is not generic we call it the Z-problem. On the dual field
theory side the Z-problem corresponds to massless excitations of the phase
(Goldstone modes) that we attempt to fix using Higgs mechanism. The simplest
dual theory which does not suffer from the massless excitation (or from the
Z-problem) is the Abelian-Higgs model which we argue can be used for finding
the shortest quantum circuits. Since every trajectory of the field theory is
mapped directly to a quantum circuit, the shortest quantum circuits are
identified with semiclassical trajectories. We also discuss the complexity of
an actual algorithm that uses a dual theory prospective for solving the quantum
maze problem and compare it with a geometric approach. We argue that it might
be possible to solve the problem in sub-exponential time in 2^N, but for that
we must consider the Klein-Gordon theory on curved spatial geometry and/or more
complicated (than N-torus) topology.

is found by balancing rotation, turbulence and self-gravity, while turbulence
is maintained by accretion driving and dissipates in one crossing time. The
angular momentum and the accretion rate of the proto-cluster are estimated from
the parent cloud properties. The two-dimensional virial model predicts the size
and velocity dispersion given the mass of the proto-cluster and that of the
parent cloud. The gaseous proto-clusters lie on a sequence of equilibrium with
the trend $R \sim M^{0.5}$, with limited variations depending on the
evolutionary stage, the parent cloud, and the parameters not well known like
turbulence driving efficiency by accretion and the turbulence anisotropy. The
model reproduces successfully observations and simulation results. The
properties of proto-clusters follow universal relations and they can be derived
from that of the parent cloud. Using simple estimates to infer the peak
position of the core mass function (CMF) we find a weak dependence on the
cluster mass suggesting that the physical conditions inside proto-clusters may
contribute to set a CMF, and by extension an IMF, that looks independent of the

heavily parametrized econometric frameworks, making them susceptible to model
misspecification. This paper investigates how misspecification affects the
results of inference in these models. Specifically, we consider a local
misspecification framework in which specification errors are assumed to vanish
at an arbitrary and unknown rate with the sample size. Relative to global
misspecification, the local misspecification analysis has two important
advantages. First, it yields tractable and general results. Second, it allows
us to focus on parameters with structural interpretation, instead of
""pseudo-true"" parameters.
  We consider a general class of two-step estimators based on the K-stage
sequential policy function iteration algorithm, where K denotes the number of
iterations employed in the estimation. This class includes Hotz and Miller
(1993)'s conditional choice probability estimator, Aguirregabiria and Mira
(2002)'s pseudo-likelihood estimator, and Pesendorfer and Schmidt-Dengler
(2008)'s asymptotic least squares estimator.
  We show that local misspecification can affect the asymptotic distribution
and even the rate of convergence of these estimators. In principle, one might
expect that the effect of the local misspecification could change with the
number of iterations K. One of our main findings is that this is not the case,
i.e., the effect of local misspecification is invariant to K. In practice, this
means that researchers cannot eliminate or even alleviate problems of model
misspecification by changing K.

Laplacian $(-\Delta_x)^{-\frac{\sigma}{2}}$ has a similar property: it can be
obtained as a Neumann-to-Dirichlet map via an extension problem to the upper
half space. We also show an explicit formula for the solution of the extension
problem. Moreover, we deal with powers of a more general class of second order
differential operators defined in open subsets of $\mathbb{R}^N$ using the
results of Stinga and Torrea. From this characterization we show possible
applications among which we mention the numerical analysis of a wide class of
nonlinear and nonlocal equations.

approach to developing robust distributed algorithms for programmable matter
systems using Markov chains. We are able to leverage the wealth of prior work
in Markov chains and related areas to design and rigorously analyze our
distributed algorithms and show that they have several desirable properties.
  We study the compression problem, in which a particle system must gather as
tightly together as possible, as in a sphere or its equivalent in the presence
of some underlying geometry. More specifically, we seek fully distributed,
local, and asynchronous algorithms that lead the system to converge to a
configuration with small boundary. We present a Markov chain-based algorithm
that solves the compression problem under the geometric amoebot model, for
particle systems that begin in a connected configuration. The algorithm takes
as input a bias parameter $\lambda$, where $\lambda > 1$ corresponds to
particles favoring having more neighbors. We show that for all $\lambda >
2+\sqrt{2}$, there is a constant $\alpha > 1$ such that eventually with all but
exponentially small probability the particles are $\alpha$-compressed, meaning
the perimeter of the system configuration is at most $\alpha \cdot p_{min}$,
where $p_{min}$ is the minimum possible perimeter of the particle system.
Surprisingly, the same algorithm can also be used for expansion when $0 <
\lambda < 2.17$, and we prove similar results about expansion for values of
$\lambda$ in this range. This is counterintuitive as it shows that particles
preferring to be next to each other ($\lambda > 1$) is not sufficient to
guarantee compression.

facilitated by motor proteins - proteins converting chemical energy into
kinetic energy. It is known that motor proteins work in teams enabling
unidirectional and bidirectional transport of intracellular cargo over long
distances. Disruptions of the underlying transport mechanisms, often caused by
mutations that alter single motor characteristics, are known to cause
neurodegenerative diseases. For example, phosphorylation of kinesin motor
domain at the serine residue is implicated in Huntington's disease, with a
recent study of phosphorylated and phosphomimetic serine residues indicating
lowered single motor stalling forces. In this article we report the effects of
mutations of this nature on transport properties of cargo carried by multiple
wild-type and mutant motors. Results indicate that mutants with altered stall
forces might determine the average velocity and run-length even when they are
outnumbered by wild type motors in the ensemble. It is shown that mutants gain
a competitive advantage and lead to an increase in expected run-length when
load on the cargo is in the vicinity of the mutant's stalling force or a
multiple of its stalling force. A separate contribution of this article is the
development of a semi-analytic method to analyze transport of cargo by multiple
motors of multiple types. The technique determines transition rates between
various relative configurations of motors carrying the cargo using the
transition rates between various absolute configurations. This enables exact
computation of average velocity and run-length. It can also be used to
introduce alterations of various single motor parameters to model a mutation
and to deduce effects of such alterations on the transport of a common cargo by
multiple motors. Our method is easily implementable and we provide a software
package for general use.

usually the detection of excess infrared emission from the population of small

replenishment, and indicating that the disk must be excited by an unseen
perturber. Previous theoretical studies have demonstrated that an eccentric
planet orbiting interior to the disk will stir the larger bodies in the belt
and produce dust via interparticle collisions. However, motivated by recent
observations, we explore another possible mechanism for heating a debris disk:
a stellar-mass perturber orbiting exterior to and inclined to the disk and
exciting the disk particles' eccentricities and inclinations via the
Kozai-Lidov mechanism. We explore the consequences of an exterior perturber on
the evolution of a debris disk using secular analysis and collisional N-body

disk via collisions and we compare the results of the Kozai-Lidov excited disk
with a simulated disk perturbed by an interior eccentric planet. Finally, we
propose two observational tests of a dust disk that can distinguish whether the

overall picture of magnetic field build-up is consistent with development of
Weibel instability. However, the long-term injection of anisotropic pairs in
the upstream leads to formation of large-scale structures in the magnetic
field, while the small-scale structures are almost absent. We find that being
amplified at the shock front this magnetic field mostly preserves its large
spatial scale and then slowly decays in the downstream on a timescale
approximately equal to duration of the injection phase. The observed decay of
the magnetic field is in exceptionally good agreement with predictions of the
so-called phase mixing model. Generation of the long-lived magnetic field in
relativistic collisionless shocks with injection-modified upstream explains how
they can efficiently produce the synchrotron radiation in Gamma-Ray Bursts.

detailed corrections for dust extinction and stellar absorption to identify 391
HII regions at 35pc resolution over 12 kpc^2. Using tracers sensitive to the
underlying gravitational potential, we associate HII regions with either arm

metallicity, ionization parameter) are independent of environment. We calculate
the fraction of Halpha luminosity due to the diffuse ionized gas (DIG)
background contaminating each HII region, and find the DIG surface brightness
to be higher within HII regions compared to the surroundings, and slightly
higher within arm HII regions. Use of the temperature sensitive [SII]/Halpha
line ratio map instead of the Halpha surface brightness to identify HII region
boundaries does not change this result. Using the dust attenuation as a tracer
of the gas, we find depletion times consistent with previous work (2 x 10^9 yr)
with no differences between the arm and interarm, however this is very
sensitive to the DIG correction. Unlike molecular clouds, which can be
dynamically affected by the galactic environment, we see fairly consistent HII

1 system per $\sim43.5\times10^{-3}$ Mo/yr, or 1 system per $\sim$143 Mo of

formation efficiency of HMXBs in the LMC is $\sim$17 times lower than that in

metallicity of the HMXB populations in the two galaxies. We also set limits on
the kicks imparted on the neutron star during the supernova explosion. We find

nanomaterials can be easily up-scaled, opening perspectives to industrial
exploitation, and due to their versatility they can be employed to finely
tailor the size, morphology and macroscopic assembly of fibers as well as their
functional properties. Light-emitting or other active polymer nanofibers, made
of conjugated polymers or of blends embedding chromophores or other functional
dopants, are suitable for various applications in advanced photonics and
sensing technologies. In particular, their almost one-dimensional geometry and
finely tunable composition make them interesting materials for developing novel
lasing devices. However, electrospinning techniques rely on a large variety of
parameters and possible experimental geometries, and they need to be carefully
optimized in order to obtain suitable topographical and photonic properties in
the resulting nanostructures. Targeted features include smooth and uniform
fiber surface, dimensional control, as well as filament alignment, enhanced
light emission, and stimulated emission. We here present various optimization
strategies for electrospinning methods which have been implemented and
developed by us for the realization of lasing architectures based on polymer
nanofibers. The geometry of the resulting nanowires leads to peculiar
light-scattering from spun filaments, and to controllable lasing
characteristics.

location should coincide with the centroid of its own optimal sensing region.
Moreover, we discuss the dynamic sensor deployment in both homogeneous and

purpose of sensor deployment is to improve sensing performance, reflected by
distortion and coverage. We model the sensor deployment problem as a source
coding problem with distortion reflecting sensing accuracy. Traditionally,
coverage is the area covered by the sensor nodes. However, when the
communication range is limited, a WSN may be divided into several disconnected
sub-graphs. Under such a scenario, neither the conventional distortion nor the
coverage represents the sensing performance as the collected data in
disconnected sub-graphs cannot be communicated with the access point. By
defining an appropriate distortion measure, we propose a Restrained Lloyd (RL)
algorithm and a Deterministic Annealing (DA) algorithm to optimize sensor
deployment in both homogeneous and heterogeneous WSNs. Our simulation results
show that both DA and RL algorithms outperform the existing Lloyd algorithm

and then systematically evaluate and analyze them. The results show that due to
the centralized and static building controls, the actual running of green
buildings may not be energy efficient even though they may be ""green"" by
design. Inspired by ""energy proportional computing"" in modern computers, we
propose a IoT framework with smart location-based automated and networked

organizational-level energy proportionality. We further build a

To create energy efficient buildings, the first step is to sense and monitor
all the energy-consuming appliances in the buildings and record all the energy
consumption information. After that, appropriate energy saving policies can be
decided and the instructions can be sent to the control devices to apply the
energy saving adjustments. To do that, in-building two-way communication
networks are needed to connect all the sensors to collect information as well
as to send control instructions. However, most of the current devices are
provided by separate manufacturers and with separate network infrastructures
and so there is not much integration and interaction among different
subsystems. In this paper, we envision a new energy sensing and monitoring
framework with integrated communication backbone in the intelligent building
environments. Specifically, through comprehensive comparisons and
investigations, we study different candidate communicating media and protocols
like wireline, wireless, and power-line communications technologies that
potentially can be used in the intelligent buildings to realize the goals of
coordination, integration, and energy efficiency. Also, we propose an extension
""smart box"" for integration of the devices before the maturity of the
standardization process. Cloud computing and smart phone technologies are also
introduced to realize the goals of improving energy efficiency and promote

indirect way in which numerical ratings are converted to a ranking. To date,
there has been relatively limited study of regression, classification, and
testing problems based on permutation-valued features, as opposed to
permutation-valued responses. This paper studies the use of reproducing kernel
Hilbert space methods for learning from permutation-valued features. These
methods embed the rankings into an implicitly defined function space, and allow
for efficient estimation of regression and test functions in this richer space.
Our first contribution is to characterize both the feature spaces and spectral
properties associated with two kernels for rankings, the Kendall and Mallows
kernels. Using tools from representation theory, we explain the limited
expressive power of the Kendall kernel by characterizing its degenerate
spectrum, and in sharp contrast, we prove that Mallows' kernel is universal and
characteristic. We also introduce families of polynomial kernels that
interpolate between the Kendall (degree one) and Mallows' (infinite degree)
kernels. We show the practical effectiveness of our methods via applications to
Eurobarometer survey data as well as a Movielens ratings dataset.

exploration: breadth versus depth. The most biased coin problem asks how many
total coin flips are required to identify a ""heavy"" coin from an infinite bag
containing both ""heavy"" coins with mean $\theta_1 \in (0,1)$, and ""light"" coins
with mean $\theta_0 \in (0,\theta_1)$, where heavy coins are drawn from the bag
with probability $\alpha \in (0,1/2)$. The key difficulty of this problem lies
in distinguishing whether the two kinds of coins have very similar means, or
whether heavy coins are just extremely rare. This problem has applications in
crowdsourcing, anomaly detection, and radio spectrum search. Chandrasekaran et.
al. (2014) recently introduced a solution to this problem but it required
perfect knowledge of $\theta_0,\theta_1,\alpha$. In contrast, we derive
algorithms that are adaptive to partial or absent knowledge of the problem
parameters. Moreover, our techniques generalize beyond coins to more general
instances of infinitely many armed bandit problems. We also prove lower bounds
that show our algorithm's upper bounds are tight up to $\log$ factors, and on
the way characterize the sample complexity of differentiating between a single
parametric distribution and a mixture of two such distributions. As a result,
these bounds have surprising implications both for solutions to the most biased
coin problem and for anomaly detection when only partial information about the
parameters is known.

these questions, we compared DR approaches in two relatively large databases of
spontaneous facial behavior (45 participants in total with over 2 minutes of
FACS-coded video per participant). Facial features were tracked and aligned
using active appearance models (AAM). SIFT and Gabor features were extracted
from local facial regions. We compared linear (PCA and KPCA), manifold (LPP and
LLE), supervised (LDA and KDA) and hybrid approaches (LSDA) to DR with respect
to AU detection. For further comparison, a no-DR control condition was included
as well. Linear support vector machine classifiers with independent train and
test sets were used for AU detection. AU detection was quantified using area
under the ROC curve and F1. Baseline results for PCA with Gabor features were
comparable with previous research. With some notable exceptions, DR improved AU
detection relative to no-DR. Locality embedding approaches proved vulnerable to
\emph{out-of-sample} problems. Gradient-based SIFT lead to better AU detection
than the filter-based Gabor features. For area under the curve, few differences
were found between linear and other DR approaches. For F1, results were mixed.
For both metrics, the pattern of results varied among action units. These
findings suggest that action unit detection may be optimized by using specific
DR for specific action units. PCA and LDA were the most efficient approaches;
KDA was the least efficient.

targets in the indirect searches for particle dark matter. To set robust
constraints on candidate of dark matter particles, understanding the dark halo
structure of these systems is of substantial importance. In this paper, we
first evaluate the astrophysical factors for dark matter annihilation and decay
for 24 dSphs, with taking into account a non-spherical dark halo, using
generalized axisymmetric mass models based on axisymmetric Jeans equations.
First, from a fitting analysis of the most recent kinematic data available, our
axisymmetric mass models are a much better fit than previous spherical ones,
thus, our work should be the most realistic and reliable estimator for
astrophysical factors. Secondly, we find that among analysed dSphs, the
ultra-faint dwarf galaxies Triangulum II and Ursa Major II are the most
promising but large uncertain targets for dark matter annihilation while the
classical dSph Draco is the most robust and detectable target for dark matter
decay. It is also found that the non-sphericity of luminous and dark components
influences the estimate of astrophysical factors, even though these factors
largely depend on the sample size, the prior range of parameters and the
spatial extent of the dark halo. Moreover, owing to these effects, the
constraints on the dark matter annihilation cross-section are more conservative
than those of previous spherical works. These results are important for
optimizing and designing dark matter searches in current and future
multi-messenger observations by space and ground-based telescopes.

robot uses an original, trusted sensor cue for training to recognize an

performing its task in the case that the original cue becomes unavailable. We
study this persistent form of SSL in the context of a flying robot that has to
avoid obstacles based on distance estimates from the visual cue of stereo
vision. Over time it will learn to also estimate distances based on monocular
appearance cues. A strategy is introduced that has the robot switch from stereo
vision based flight to monocular flight, with stereo vision purely used as
'training wheels' to avoid imminent collisions. This strategy is shown to be an
effective approach to the 'feedback-induced data bias' problem as also
experienced in learning from demonstration. Both simulations and real-world
experiments with a stereo vision equipped AR drone 2.0 show the feasibility of
this approach, with the robot successfully using monocular vision to avoid
obstacles in a 5 x 5 room. The experiments show the potential of persistent SSL
as a robust learning approach to enhance the capabilities of robots. Moreover,
the abundant training data coming from the own sensors allows to gather large
data sets necessary for deep learning approaches.

determine characteristic words for both discussion styles. Thereby, we also
investigated whether function words like pronouns and conjunctions play an

and trapping to special types of elements that do not include highly abundant
and chemically relevant atoms such as hydrogen, carbon, oxygen, and nitrogen.
Here, we demonstrate that Doppler cooling and trapping by optical frequency
combs may provide a route to trapped, ultracold atoms whose spectra are not
amenable to CW lasers. We laser cool a gas of atoms by driving a two-photon
transition with an optical frequency comb, an efficient process to which every
comb tooth coherently contributes. We extend this technique to create a
magneto-optical trap (MOT), an electromagnetic beaker for accumulating the
laser-cooled atoms for further study. Our results suggest that the efficient

with the essentially bosonic thermal environment when the relevant molecular
electronic energy is far from the metal(s) Fermi energy(ies). It increases when
the molecular electronic level is close to the metal Fermi level so that an
additional vibrational relaxation channel due to electron-hole (eh) excition in
the molecule opens. Other contributions to the Raman signal, of considerably
broader linewidths, can become important at larger junction bias.

Recognizing these fluents has broad applications, yet have received scant

a Fourier basis, where the coefficients of the basis are obtained by solving a
series of least-squares problems. The coefficients can be efficiently computed
using a recursive form of the QR decomposition. By controlling the cardinality
of the Fourier basis, we can obtain a good tradeoff between the run-time and
the filtering accuracy. In particular, we are able to guarantee sub-pixel
accuracy for the overall filtering, which is not provided by most existing
methods for fast bilateral filtering. We present simulation results to

build logic gates into useful processing circuits. While the salient features
of a quantum computer have been shown in proof-of-principle experiments,
difficulties in scaling quantum systems have made more complex operations
intractable. This is exemplified in the classical Fredkin (controlled-SWAP)
gate for which, despite theoretical proposals, no quantum analogue has been
realised. By adding control to the SWAP unitary, we use photonic qubit logic to
demonstrate the first quantum Fredkin gate, which promises many applications in
quantum information and measurement. We implement example algorithms and
generate the highest-fidelity three-photon GHZ states to-date. The technique we
use allows one to add a control operation to a black-box unitary, something
impossible in the standard circuit model. Our experiment represents the first
use of this technique to control a two-qubit operation and paves the way for
larger controlled circuits to be realised efficiently.

biasing the potential energy function $V$ of a diffusion process
$dX_t^0=-\nabla V(X_t^0)dt+dW_t$; for the sake of simplicity, periodic boundary
conditions are assumed, so that $X_t^0$ lives on the flat $d$-dimensional
torus. The goal is to sample its invariant distribution
$\mu=Z^{-1}\exp\bigl(-V(x)\bigr)\,dx$. The bias $V_t-V$, where $V_t$ is the new
(random and time-dependent) potential function, acts only on some coordinates
of the system, and is designed to flatten the corresponding empirical
occupation measure of the diffusion $X$ in the large time regime.
  The diffusion process writes $dX_t=-\nabla V_t(X_t)dt+dW_t$, where the bias
$V_t-V$ is function of the key quantity $\overline{\mu}_t$: a probability
occupation measure which depends on the past of the process, {\it i.e.} on
$(X_s)_{s\in [0,t]}$. We are thus dealing with a self-interacting diffusion.
  In this note, we prove that when $t$ goes to infinity, $\overline{\mu}_t$
almost surely converges to $\mu$. Moreover, the approach is justified by the
convergence of the bias to a limit which has an intepretation in terms of a
free energy.
  The main argument is a change of variables, which formally validates the
consistency of the approach. The convergence is then rigorously proven adapting
the ODE method from stochastic approximation.

worldwide, and manufacturers are eager to obtain a better understanding of
customer behavior in various regions. To achieve this goal, most previous
efforts have focused mainly on questionnaires, which are time-consuming and
costly. The tremendous volume of product reviews on e-commerce websites has
seen a new trend emerge, whereby manufacturers attempt to understand user
preferences by analyzing online reviews. Following this trend, this paper
addresses the problem of studying customer behavior by exploiting recently
developed opinion mining techniques. This work is novel for three reasons.
First, questionnaire-based investigation is automatically enabled by employing
algorithms for template-based question generation and opinion mining-based
answer extraction. Using this system, manufacturers are able to obtain reports
of customer behavior featuring a much larger sample size, more direct
information, a higher degree of automation, and a lower cost. Second,
international customer behavior study is made easier by integrating tools for
multilingual opinion mining. Third, this is the first time an automatic
questionnaire investigation has been conducted to compare customer behavior in
China and America, where product reviews are written and read in Chinese and
English, respectively. Our study on digital cameras, smartphones, and tablet
computers yields three findings. First, Chinese customers follow the Doctrine
of the Mean, and often use euphemistic expressions, while American customers
express their opinions more directly. Second, Chinese customers care more about
general feelings, while American customers pay more attention to product
details. Third, Chinese customers focus on external features, while American
customers care more about the internal features of products.

academic impact mainly involve citations, which is easy but limited to
interrogating traditional citation databases and scholarly book reviews,
Researchers have attempted to use other metrics, such as Google Books,
libcitation, and publisher prestige. However, these approaches lack
content-level information and cannot determine the citation intentions of
users. Meanwhile, the abundant online review resources concerning academic
books can be used to mine deeper information and content utilizing altmetric
perspectives. In this study, we measure the impacts of academic books by
multi-granularity mining online reviews, and we identify factors that affect a
book's impact. First, online reviews of a sample of academic books on Amazon.cn
are crawled and processed. Then, multi-granularity review mining is conducted
to identify review sentiment polarities and aspects' sentiment values. Lastly,
the numbers of positive reviews and negative reviews, aspect sentiment values,
star values, and information regarding helpfulness are integrated via the
entropy method, and lead to the calculation of the final book impact scores.
The results of a correlation analysis of book impact scores obtained via our
method versus traditional book citations show that, although there are
substantial differences between subject areas, online book reviews tend to
reflect the academic impact. Thus, we infer that online reviews represent a
promising source for mining book impact within the altmetric perspective and at
the multi-granularity content level. Moreover, our proposed method might also
be a means by which to measure other books besides academic publications.

an appearance codebook by clustering local image features. However, how to
choose appropriate values for the parameters used in the clustering step
remains an open problem. Moreover, some popular histogram features extracted
from overlapping image blocks may cause a high degree of redundancy and
multicollinearity. In this paper, we propose a novel Hough Transform-based
object detection approach. First, to address the above issues, we exploit a
Bridge Partial Least Squares (BPLS) technique to establish context-encoded
Hough Regression Models (HRMs), which are linear regression models that cast
probabilistic Hough votes to predict object locations. BPLS is an efficient
variant of Partial Least Squares (PLS). PLS-based regression techniques
(including BPLS) can reduce the redundancy and eliminate the multicollinearity
of a feature set. And the appropriate value of the only parameter used in PLS
(i.e., the number of latent components) can be determined by using a
cross-validation procedure. Second, to efficiently handle object scale changes,
we propose a novel multi-scale voting scheme. In this scheme, multiple Hough
images corresponding to multiple object scales can be obtained simultaneously.
Third, an object in a test image may correspond to multiple true and false
positive hypotheses at different scales. Based on the proposed multi-scale
voting scheme, a principled strategy is proposed to fuse hypotheses to reduce
false positives by evaluating normalized pointwise mutual information between
hypotheses. In the experiments, we also compare the proposed HRM approach with
its several variants to evaluate the influences of its components on its
performance. Experimental results show that the proposed HRM approach has
achieved desirable performances on popular benchmark datasets.

the Exact Second-Order Method (ESOM) to solve the dynamic optimization problem

reassigned to the wavelet domain. The key idea behind this method is that the
image mixture can be decomposed into the sum of uncorrelated and/or independent
sub-bands using wavelet transform. Initially, the observed image is
pre-whitened in the space domain. Afterwards, an initial separation matrix is
estimated from the second order statistics de-correlation model in the wavelet
domain. Later, this matrix will be used as an initial separation matrix for the
higher order statistics stage in order to find the best separation matrix. The
suggested algorithm was tested using natural images.Experiments have confirmed
that the use of the proposed process provides promising outcomes in identifying

exists between the positions of Ia and core-collapse (CC) SNe relative to the
peaks of arms, while in NGD galaxies the positions show no such shifts; (2) in
GD galaxies, the positions of CC SNe relative to the peaks of arms are
correlated with the radial distance from the galaxy nucleus. Inside (outside)
the corotation radius, CC SNe are found closer to the inner (outer) edge. No
such correlation is observed for SNe in NGD galaxies nor for SNe Ia in either
galaxy class; (3) in GD galaxies, SNe Ibc occur closer to the leading edges of
the arms than do SNe II, while in NGD galaxies they are more concentrated
towards the peaks of arms. In both samples of hosts, the distributions of SNe
Ia relative to the arms have broader wings. These observations suggest that
shocks in spiral arms of GD galaxies trigger star formation in the leading
edges of arms affecting the distributions of CC SNe (known to have short-lived
progenitors). The closer locations of SNe Ibc vs. SNe II relative to the
leading edges of the arms supports the belief that SNe Ibc have more massive
progenitors. SNe Ia having less massive and older progenitors, have more time
to drift away from the leading edge of the spiral arms.

to a particular target domain. Most methods for unsupervised domain adaptation
proposed in the literature to date, assume that the set of classes present in
the target domain is identical to the set of classes present in the source
domain. This is a restrictive assumption that limits the practical
applicability of unsupervised domain adaptation techniques in real world
settings (""in the wild""). Therefore, we relax this constraint and propose a
technique that allows the set of target classes to be a subset of the source
classes. This way, large publicly available annotated datasets with a wide
variety of classes can be used as source, even if the actual set of classes in
target can be more limited and, maybe most importantly, unknown beforehand.
  To this end, we propose an algorithm that orders a set of source subspaces
that are relevant to the target classification problem. Our method then chooses
a restricted set from this ordered set of source subspaces. As an extension,
even starting from multiple source datasets with varied sets of categories,
this method automatically selects an appropriate subset of source categories
relevant to a target dataset. Empirical analysis on a number of source and
target domain datasets shows that restricting the source subspace to only a
subset of categories does indeed substantially improve the eventual target
classification accuracy over the baseline that considers all source classes.

alignment applicable to genome information analysis. By applying moire
technique to spatial encoding patterns of deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA)
sequences, association information of the genome and the expressed phenotypes
could more effectively be extracted. Such moire fringes reveal occurrence of
matching, deletion and insertion between DNA sequences providing useful
visualized information for prediction of gene function and classification of
species. Furthermore, by applying a cylindrical lens, a new technique is
proposed to map two-dimensional (2D) association information to a
one-dimensional (1D) column of pixels, where each pixel in the column is
representative of superposition of all bright and dark pixels in the
corresponding row. By such a time-consuming preprocessing, local similarities
between two intended patterns can readily be found by just using a 1D array of
photodetectors and postprocessing could be performed on specified parts in the
initial 2D pattern. We also evaluate our proposed circular encoding adapted for
poor data alignment condition. Our simulation results together with
experimental implementation verify the effectiveness of our dynamic proposed
methods which significantly improve system parameters such as processing gain
and signal to noise ratio (SNR).

suggest that SOC in graphene can be substantially enhanced by extrinsic means,

transport in graphene that accounts for the full spin-coherent dynamics of the
carriers, including hitherto-neglected spin precession processes during
resonant scattering with dilute impurities. We identify a novel ""anisotropic

SOC, which contributes to a large current-induced spin polarization in
graphene. The theory also yields a comprehensive description of the spin
relaxation mechanisms in impurity-decorated graphene: the Elliot-Yafet and
Dyakonov-Perel relaxation rates are both present, and we find that the latter
can dominate for some choices of carrier density and impurity strength. This
provides theoretical foundations for designing future graphene-based integrated

instance, we take this method based on the NPR to distinguish several
Cardassian scenarios from the base cosmology scenario, and one from the other.
We place constraints on three Cardassian cosmological scenarios and their flat
versions by utilizing the Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia), baryonic acoustic
oscillations (BAO), cosmic microwave background (CMB) radiation, observational
Hubble parameter (OHD) data-sets as well as the single data point from the

signals on graphs or for Markov chains observed at random times. Our approach
is based on minimizing a cost function given by the Frobenius norm of the
commutator $\mathsf{A} \mathsf{B}-\mathsf{B} \mathsf{A}$ between symmetric
matrices $\mathsf{A}$ and $\mathsf{B}$.
  In the Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi model with no self-loops, we show that
identifiability (i.e., the ability to reconstruct $W$ from the knowledge of its
eigenspaces) follows a sharp phase transition on the expected number of edges
with threshold function $N\log N/2$.
  Given an estimation of the eigenspaces based on a $n$-sample, we provide
support selection procedures from theoretical and practical point of views. In
particular, when deleting an edge from the active support, our study unveils
that our test statistic is the order of $\mathcal O(1/n)$ when we overestimate
the true support and lower bounded by a positive constant when the estimated
support is smaller than the true support. This feature leads to a powerful
practical support estimation procedure. Simulated and real life numerical

has attracted the attention of scholars and sport enthusiasts. These studies
have been mainly focused on identifying the phenomenon and trying to correlate
it with external factors such as crowd noise and referee bias. Much less is
known about the effects of home advantage in the microscopic dynamics of the
game (within the game) or possible team-specific and evolving features of this
phenomenon. Here we present a detailed study of these previous features in the
National Basketball Association (NBA). By analyzing play-by-play events of more
than sixteen thousand games that span thirteen NBA seasons, we have found that
home advantage affects the microscopic dynamics of the game by increasing the
scoring rates and decreasing the time intervals between scores of teams playing
home. We verified that these two features are different among the NBA teams,
for instance, the scoring rate of the Cleveland Cavaliers team is increased
0.16 points per minute (on average the seasons 2004-05 to 2013-14) when playing
home, whereas for the New Jersey Nets (now the Brooklyn Nets) this rate
increases in only 0.04 points per minute. We further observed that these
microscopic features have evolved over time in a non-trivial manner when
analyzing the results team-by-team. However, after averaging over all teams
some regularities emerge; in particular, we noticed that the average
differences in the scoring rates and in the characteristic times (related to
the time intervals between scores) have slightly decreased over time,
suggesting a weakening of the phenomenon.

and exponential load model in the complex plane. Modeling the action of network
controllers that regulate the magnitude of voltage phasors is a challenging
task in the complex plane as it has to preserve the framework of holomorphicity
for obtention of these complex variables with fixed magnitude. The paper
presents two distinct approaches to modelling the voltage control of generator
nodes. Exponential (or voltage-dependent) load models are crucial for accurate
power flow studies under stressed conditions. This new framework for power flow
studies exploits the theory of analytic continuation, especially the monodromy
theorem for resolving issues that have plagued conventional numerical methods
for decades. Here the focus is on the indispensable role of Pade approximants
for analytic continuation of complex functions, expressed as power series,
beyond the boundary of convergence of the series. The zero-pole distribution of
these rational approximants serves as a proximity index to voltage collapse.
Finally the mathematical underpinnings of this framework, namely the Stahl's
theory and the rate of convergence of Pade approximants are explained.
