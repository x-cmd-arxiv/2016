free energy per particle of infinite homogeneous nuclear matter with respect to
the isospin asymmetry are extracted numerically using finite differences, and
the resulting polynomial isospin-asymmetry parametrizations are compared to the
full isospin-asymmetry dependence of the free energy. It is found that in the
low-temperature and high-density regime where the radius of convergence of the
expansion is generically zero, the inclusion of higher-order terms beyond the
leading quadratic approximation leads overall to a significantly poorer
description of the isospin-asymmetry dependence. In contrast, at high
temperatures and densities well below nuclear saturation density, the
interaction contributions to the higher-order coefficients are negligible and
the deviations from the quadratic approximation are predominantly from the
noninteracting term in the many-body perturbation series. Furthermore, we
extract the leading logarithmic term in the isospin-asymmetry expansion of the
equation of state at zero temperature from the analysis of linear combinations
of finite differences. It is shown that the logarithmic term leads to a
considerably improved description of the isospin-asymmetry dependence at zero

theoretical and practical importance. The Lagrangian view provides a privileged
perspective for studying the dynamics of turbulence in general, and of the
velocity gradient tensor in particular. Stochastic models for the Lagrangian
evolution of velocity gradients in isotropic turbulence, with closure models
for the pressure Hesssian and viscous Laplacian, have been shown to reproduce
important features such as non-Gaussian probability distributions, skewness and
vorticity strain-rate alignments. The Recent Fluid Deformation (RFD) closure
introduced the idea of mapping an isotropic Lagrangian pressure Hessian as
upstream initial condition using the fluid deformation tensor. Recent work on a
Gaussian fields closure, however, has shown that even Gaussian isotropic
velocity fields contain significant anisotropy for the conditional pressure
Hessian tensor due to the inherent velocity-pressure couplings, and that
assuming an isotropic pressure Hessian as upstream condition may not be
realistic. In this paper, Gaussian isotropic field statistics are used to
generate more physical upstream conditions for the recent fluid deformation
mapping. In this new framework, known isotropy relations can be satisfied {\it
a priori} and no DNS-tuned coefficients are necessary. A detailed comparison of
results from the new model, referred to as the recent deformation of Gaussian
fields (RDGF) closure, with existing models and DNS shows the improvements
gained, especially in various single-time statistics of the velocity gradient
tensor at moderate Reynolds numbers. Application to arbitrarily high Reynolds
numbers remains an open challenge for this type of model, however.

the three-qubit states the lower bound is equal to the negative von Neumann

most cases be determined from the peak energy of the energy density spectra
($\nu{\cal F}_{\nu}$), called '$E_{\rm peak}$'. Distributions of $E_{\rm peak}$
have been compiled for time-resolved spectra from bright GRBs, and also
time-averaged spectra and peak flux spectra for nearly every burst observed by
CGRO-BATSE and Fermi-GBM. Even when determined by an instrument with a broad
energy band, such as GBM (8 keV to 40 MeV), the distributions themselves peak
at around 240 keV in the observer's frame, with a spread of roughly a decade in
energy. $E_{\rm peak}$ can have considerable evolution (sometimes greater than
one decade) within any given burst, as amply demonstrated by single pulses in
GRB110721A and GRB130427A. Meanwhile, several luminosity or energy relations
have been proposed to correlate with either the time-integrated or peak flux
$E_{\rm peak}$. Thus, when discussing correlations with $E_{\rm peak}$, the
question arises, ""Which $E_{\rm peak}$?"". A single burst may be characterized
by any one of a number of values for $E_{\rm peak}$ that are associated with
it. Using a single pulse simulation model with spectral evolution as a proxy
for the type of spectral evolution observed in many bursts, we investigate how

games model the interplay between a player's private belief and his/her

a strategic game in which the players' strategies are the opinions and the cost
of an opinion in a state is a convex combination through a parameter
$\alpha\in[0,1]$ of two factors: the disagreement between the player's opinion
and his/her internal belief and the number of neighbors whose opinions differ
from the one of the player. The parameter $\alpha$ models how stubborn a player
is: players with large $\alpha$ change their opinion only if many neighbors
disagree with his/her belief. We consider social networks that are
heterogeneous in the sense that the parameter $\alpha$ can vary from player to
player.
  We ask if it is possible that the belief shared by the majority of the
players does not coincide with the opinion that is publicly announced by the
majority of the players in an equilibrium state. Our main result is a
characterization of the social networks that admit an initial belief assignment
for which there exists a sequence of best response moves that reach an
equilibrium in which the initial majority is subverted. Our characterization is
effective in the sense that can be tested efficiently and the initial belief
assignment that can be subverted can be computed in time polynomial in the
number of players. Our result is actually stronger as we show that in each
initial belief assignment that can be subverted, subversion is actually
obtained in a very strong way: it only takes one move of a single player, the
swing player, to lead the social network to a point of no return in which any
rational move from any player leads to a subverted majority.

an ultra-cold gas with tunable attractive interactions trapped in a spatially

strength, we observe a continuous quantum phase transition where the gas

estimate density by tracking encounter rates -- the higher the population
density, the more often the ants bump into each other [Pra05,GPT93].
  We study distributed density estimation from a theoretical perspective. We
prove that a group of anonymous agents randomly walking on a grid are able to
estimate their density within a small multiplicative error in few steps by
measuring their rates of encounter with other agents. Despite dependencies
inherent in the fact that nearby agents may collide repeatedly (and, worse,
cannot recognize when this happens), our bound nearly matches what would be
required to estimate density by independently sampling grid locations.
  From a biological perspective, our work helps shed light on how ants and
other social insects can obtain relatively accurate density estimates via
encounter rates. From a technical perspective, our analysis provides new tools
for understanding complex dependencies in the collision probabilities of
multiple random walks. We bound the strength of these dependencies using
$local\ mixing\ properties$ of the underlying graph. Our results extend beyond

semiconductor crystals are known to show strong signatures of electron-phonon
interactions, but when coupled to a structured photonic reservoir, the QD
emission properties are also determined by the frequency dependence of the LDOS
of the photon reservoir. Here, we investigate the simultaneous role of coupled
photon and phonon baths on the characteristic Mollow triplet spectra from a
strongly driven QD. As an example structured photonic reservoir, we first study
a photonic crystal coupled cavity waveguide, and find that photons and phonons
have counter-interacting effects near the upper mode-edge of the coupled-cavity
waveguide, thus establishing the importance of their separate roles in
determining the emission spectra. The general theory is developed for arbitrary
photonic reservoirs and is further applied to determine resonance the
fluorescence spectra from a realistic, disordered W1 photonic crystal waveguide
showing important photon-phonon interaction effects that are directly relevant
to emerging experiments and theoretical proposals.

beginning with the first quantitative results available, from 1834 (earlier
qualitative, accounts also exist). Eclipse meteorology attracted relatively few
publications until the total solar eclipse of 16 February 1980, with the 11
August 1999 eclipse producing the most papers. Eclipses passing over populated
areas such as Europe, China and India now regularly attract scientific
attention, whereas atmospheric measurements of eclipses at remote locations
remain rare. Many measurements and models have been used to exploit the
uniquely predictable solar forcing provided by an eclipse. In this paper we
compile the available publications and review a sub-set of them chosen on the
basis of importance and novelty. Beyond the obvious reduction in incoming solar
radiation, atmospheric cooling from eclipses can induce dynamical changes.
Observations and meteorological modelling provide evidence for the generation
of a local eclipse circulation which may be the origin of the ""eclipse wind"".
Gravity waves set up by the eclipse can, in principle, be detected as
atmospheric pressure fluctuations, though theoretical predictions are limited,
and many of the data are inconclusive. Eclipse events providing important early
insights into the ionisation of the upper atmosphere are also briefly reviewed.

characterized by the existence of a hidden algebraic structure but do not have

that their motions are characterized by a short-time transient superdiffusive

self-similar and can be approximated by a stretched Gaussian distribution. We
further investigate the probability distributions of the radial velocities of
individual trajectories. Among several candidates, we find that the generalized
gamma distribution shows a good agreement with these distributions. The
velocity time series have long-range correlations, displaying a strong
persistent behavior (Hurst exponents close to one). The prevalence of

small effects that arise at second-order in the temperature fluctuations not
from primordial physics but from such a limitation of the map-making procedure.
They constitute a contaminant for measurements of: our peculiar velocity, the

a leakage of the CMB dipole into the y-channel which couples to all multipoles,
but mostly affects the range ell <~ 400. This should be visible in Planck's

such frequency-dependent terms carry no new information on the nature of the

equations to represent its target systems: the dynamical (equations of motion)
and the kinematical (kinematical constraints). Kinematical constraints are
differentiated from equations of motion by the fact that their particular form
is fixed once and for all, irrespective of the interactions the system enters
into. By contrast, the particular form of a system's equations of motion
depends essentially on the particular interaction the system enters into. All
contemporary accounts of the structure and semantics of physical theory treat
dynamics, i.e., the equations of motion, as the most important feature of a
theory for the purposes of its philosophical analysis. I argue to the contrary
that it is the kinematical constraints that determine the structure and
empirical content of a physical theory in the most important ways: they
function as necessary preconditions for the appropriate application of the
theory; they differentiate types of physical systems; they are necessary for
the equations of motion to be well posed or even just cogent; and they guide
the experimentalist in the design of tools for measurement and observation. It
is thus satisfaction of the kinematical constraints that renders meaning to
those terms representing a system's physical quantities in the first place,
even before one can ask whether or not the system satisfies the theory's
equations of motion.

a complete graph with positive edge weights obeying the triangle inequality)
$\mathcal{M}$ that is known to the algorithm in advance. Requests arrive in a
continuous time online fashion at the points of $\mathcal{M}$ and should be
served by matching them to each other. The algorithm is allowed to delay its
request matching commitments, but this does not come for free: the total cost
of the algorithm is the sum of metric distances between matched requests
\emph{plus} the sum of times each request waited since it arrived until it was
matched. A randomized online MPMD algorithm is presented whose competitive
ratio is $O (\log^{2} n + \log \Delta)$, where $n$ is the number of points in
$\mathcal{M}$ and $\Delta$ is its aspect ratio. The analysis is based on a
machinery developed in the context of a new stochastic process that can be
viewed as two interleaved Poisson processes; surprisingly, this new process
captures precisely the behavior of our algorithm. A related problem in which
the algorithm is allowed to clear any unmatched request at a fixed penalty is
also addressed. It is suggested that the MPMD problem is merely the tip of the
iceberg for a general framework of online problems with delayed service that
captures many more natural problems.

time-frequency concentration of a signal, and constitute an important
theoretical tool for designing and evaluating linear signal transforms.
Generalizations of such principles to the graph setting can inform dictionary
design for graph signals, lead to algorithms for reconstructing missing
information from graph signals via sparse representations, and yield new graph
analysis tools. While previous work has focused on generalizing notions of
spreads of a graph signal in the vertex and graph spectral domains, our
approach is to generalize the methods of Lieb in order to develop uncertainty
principles that provide limits on the concentration of the analysis
coefficients of any graph signal under a dictionary transform whose atoms are
jointly localized in the vertex and graph spectral domains. One challenge we
highlight is that due to the inhomogeneity of the underlying graph data domain,
the local structure in a single small region of the graph can drastically
affect the uncertainty bounds for signals concentrated in different regions of
the graph, limiting the information provided by global uncertainty principles.
Accordingly, we suggest a new way to incorporate a notion of locality, and
develop local uncertainty principles that bound the concentration of the
analysis coefficients of each atom of a localized graph spectral filter frame
in terms of quantities that depend on the local structure of the graph around
the center vertex of the given atom. Finally, we demonstrate how our proposed
local uncertainty measures can improve the random sampling of graph signals.

time of 9.1 Ms, these data yield the strongest constraints to date on the
evolution of the metal content of the intracluster medium (ICM). We find no
evidence for strong evolution in the global (r<R500) ICM metallicity (dZ/dz =
-0.06 +/- 0.04 Zsun), with a mean value at z=0.6 of <Z> = 0.23 +/- 0.01 Zsun
and a scatter of 0.08 +/- 0.01 Zsun. These results imply that >60% of the
metals in the ICM were already in place at z=1 (at 95% confidence), consistent
with the picture of an early (z>1) enrichment. We find, in agreement with
previous works, a significantly higher mean value for the metallicity in the
centers of cool core clusters versus non-cool core clusters. We find weak
evidence for evolution in the central metallicity of cool core clusters (dZ/dz
= -0.21 +/- 0.11 Zsun), which is sufficient to account for this enhanced
central metallicity over the past ~10 Gyr. We find no evidence for metallicity
evolution outside of the core (dZ/dz = -0.03 +/- 0.06 Zsun), and no significant
difference in the core-excised metallicity between cool core and non-cool core
clusters. This suggests that strong radio-mode AGN feedback does not
significantly alter the distribution of metals at r>0.15R500. Given the
limitations of current-generation X-ray telescopes in constraining the ICM
metallicity at z>1, significant improvements on this work will likely require
next-generation X-ray missions.

the properties of galactic outflows. In this paper, we augment our previous
analysis of the systematic properties of starburst-driven galactic outflows by
expanding our sample to include a rare population of starbursts with
exceptionally high outflow velocities. In principle, these could be a
qualitatively different phenomenon from more typical outflows. However, we find
that instead these starbursts lie on, or along the extrapolation of, the trends
defined by the more typical systems studied previously by us. We exploit the
wide dynamic range provided by this new sample to determine scaling relations
of outflow velocity with galaxy stellar mass (M*), circular velocity,
star-formation rate (SFR), SFR/M*, and SFR/area. We argue that these results
can be accommodated within the general interpretational framework we previously
advocated, in which a population of ambient interstellar or circum-galactic
clouds is accelerated by the combined forces of gravity and the momentum flux
from the starburst. We show that this simple physical picture is consistent
with both the strong cosmological evolution of galactic outflows in typical
star-forming galaxies and the paucity of such galaxies with spectra showing
inflows. We also present simple parameterizations of these results that can be
implemented in theoretical models and numerical simulations of galaxy
evolution.

versatile modeling of the emission from stars and photoionized gas, attenuation

stellar evolution. Here we report on the serendipitous discovery of 20 Li-rich
giants observed during the Gaia-ESO Survey, which includes the first nine
Li-rich giant stars known towards the CoRoT fields. Most of our Li-rich giants
have near-solar metallicities, and stellar parameters consistent with being
before the luminosity bump. This is difficult to reconcile with deep mixing
models proposed to explain lithium enrichment, because these models can only
operate at later evolutionary stages: at or past the luminosity bump. In an
effort to shed light on the Li-rich phenomenon, we highlight recent evidence of
the tidal destruction of close-in hot Jupiters at the sub-giant phase. We note
that when coupled with models of planet accretion, the observed destruction of
hot Jupiters actually predicts the existence of Li-rich giant stars, and
suggests Li-rich stars should be found early on the giant branch and occur more
frequently with increasing metallicity. A comprehensive review of all known
Li-rich giant stars reveals that this scenario is consistent with the data.
However more evolved or metal-poor stars are less likely to host close-in giant
planets, implying that their Li-rich origin requires an alternative
explanation, likely related to mixing scenarios rather than external phenomena.

compressed sensing to limit overall model complexity while retaining model
freedom. The model is trained with a set of 12,681 red-giant stars with high
signal-to-noise spectroscopic observations and stellar parameters and
abundances taken from the APOGEE Survey. We find that we can successfully train
and use a model with 17 stellar labels. Validation shows that the model does a
good job of inferring all 17 labels (typical abundance precision is 0.04 dex),
even when we degrade the signal-to-noise by discarding ~50% of the observing
time. The model dependencies make sense: the spectral derivatives with respect
to abundances correlate with known atomic lines, and we identify elements
belonging to atomic lines that were previously unknown. We recover
(anti-)correlations in abundance labels for globular cluster stars, consistent

astronomical archives which remain severely under-utilised. The lack of
reliable open-source tools for analysing large volumes of spectra contributes
to this situation, which is poised to worsen as large surveys successively
release orders of magnitude more spectra. In this Article I introduce sick, the
spectroscopic inference crank, a flexible and fast Bayesian tool for inferring
astrophysical parameters from spectra. sick can be used to provide a
nearest-neighbour estimate of model parameters, a numerically optimised point
estimate, or full Markov Chain Monte Carlo sampling of the posterior
probability distributions. This generality empowers any astronomer to
capitalise on the plethora of published synthetic and observed spectra, and
make precise inferences for a host of astrophysical (and nuisance) quantities.
Model intensities can be reliably approximated from existing grids of synthetic
or observed spectra using linear multi-dimensional interpolation, or a
Cannon-based model. Additional phenomena that transform the data (e.g.,
redshift, rotational broadening, continuum, spectral resolution) are
incorporated as free parameters and can be marginalised away. Outlier pixels
(e.g., cosmic rays or poorly modelled regimes) can be treated with a Gaussian
mixture model, and a noise model is included to account for systematically
underestimated variance. Combining these phenomena into a scalar-justified,
quantitative model permits precise inferences with credible uncertainties on
noisy data. Using a forward model on low-resolution, high S/N spectra of M67

-induced by a quench- of local excitations in one dimension. We focus on
interaction quenches: the considered protocol consists in creating a stable
localized excitation propagating through the system, and then operating a
sudden change of the interaction between the particles. To highlight the effect
of the quench, we take the initial excitation to be a soliton. The quench
splits the excitation into two packets moving in opposite directions, whose
characteristics can be expressed in a universal way. Our treatment allows to
describe the internal dynamics of these two packets in terms of the different
velocities of their components. We confirm our analytical predictions through
numerical simulations performed with the Gross-Pitaevskii equation and with the
Calogero model (as an example of long range interactions and solvable with a
parabolic confinement). Through the Calogero model we also discuss the effect
of an external trapping on the protocol. The hydrodynamic approach shows that
there is a difference between the bulk velocities of the propagating packets
and the velocities of their peaks: it is possible to discriminate the two
quantities, as we show through the comparison between numerical simulations and
analytical estimates. In the realizations of the discussed quench protocol in a
cold atom experiment, these different velocities are accessible through
different measurement procedures.

strongly impact the QCD perturbative series, causing nontrivial theoretical
uncertainties. We consider slepton pair production with 0 signal jets, for
which we perform the resummation of jet-veto logarithms and study its impact.
Currently, the experimental exclusion limits take the jet-veto cut into account
by extrapolating to the inclusive cross section using parton shower Monte
Carlos. Our results indicate that the associated theoretical uncertainties can
be large, and when taken into account have a sizeable impact already on present
exclusion limits. This is improved by performing the resummation to higher

improved theory predictions, it would be useful for the experimental analyses

disputed the relevance of chiral counting for chiral Lagrangians, and in

As an alternative, a power counting based on `primary dimensions' has been
proposed. The difficulties encountered with this scheme led the authors to
suggest that even the leading order of the electroweak chiral Lagrangian could
not be clearly defined. Here we demonstrate that the concept of primary

provide a structurally robust context where, within the low energy description,
the dimensionless SM couplings are weak, while the new strong dynamics
manifests itself exclusively through higher-derivative interactions. We present
an exhaustive classification of such scenarios in the form of effective field
theories, paying special attention to new classes of models where the strong
dynamics involves, along with the Higgs boson, the SM gauge bosons and/or the
fermions. The IR softness of the new dynamics suppresses its effects at LEP
energies, but deviations are in principle detectable at the LHC, even at
energies below the threshold for production of new states. Our construction
provides the so far unique structurally robust context where to motivate
several searches in Higgs physics, diboson production, or WW scattering, which
were so far poorly justified. Perhaps surprisingly, the interplay between weak
coupling, strong coupling and derivatives, which is controlled by symmetries,
can override the naive expansion in operator dimension, providing instances
where dimension-8 dominates dimension-6, well within the domain of validity of
the low energy effective theory. This result reveals the limitations of an

However, the origin of this kink remains elusive. By taking advantage of the
combo of reactive molecular beam epitaxy and in situ angle-resolved
photoemission spectroscopy, we systematically studied the evolution of the
low-energy electronic structure of SrRuO3 films with thickness thinning down to
nearly two-dimensional limit in a well-controlled way. The kink structure
persists even in the 4-unit-cell-thick film. Moreover, through quantitative
self-energy analysis, we observed the negligible thickness dependence of the
binding energy of the kink, which is in sharp contrast to the downward trend of
the Curie temperature with reducing the film thickness. Together with
previously reported transport and Raman studies, this finding suggests that the
kink of perovskite SrRuO3 should originate from the electron-phonon coupling
rather than magnetic collective modes, and the in-plane phonons may play a
dominant role. Considering such a kink structure of SrRuO3 is similar to these
of many other correlated oxides, we suggest the possible ubiquity of the
coupling of electrons to oxygen-related phonons in correlated oxides.

screening mechanism to allow phenomenologically interesting deviations from
general relativity (GR) to manifest on larger scales, while reducing to GR on
small scales. The observation of the transition from screened to unscreened
behavior would be compelling evidence for beyond-GR physics. We show that
pairwise peculiar velocity statistics, in particular the relative radial
velocity dispersion, $\sigma_\parallel$ , can be used to observe this
transition when they are binned by some measure of halo environment. We
established this by measuring the radial velocity dispersion between pairs of
halos in N-body simulations for three $f(R)$ gravity and four symmetron models.
We developed an estimator involving only line-of-sight velocities to show that
this quantity is observable, and binned the results in halo mass, ambient
density, and the isolatedness of halos. Ambient density is found to be the most
relevant measure of environment; it is distinct from isolatedness, and
correlates well with theoretical expectations for the symmetron model. By
binning $\sigma_\parallel$ in ambient density, we find a strong
environment-dependent signature for the symmetron models, with the velocities
showing a clear transition from GR to non-GR behavior. No such transition is
observed for $f(R)$, as the relevant scales are deep in the unscreened regime.
Observations of the relative radial velocity dispersion in forthcoming peculiar
velocity surveys, if binned appropriately by environment, therefore offer a
valuable way of detecting the screening signature of modified gravity.

the VLA to observe primary science using the higher frequencies receivers (1-50

correlator. VLITE operates during nearly all observing programs and provides 64
MHz of bandwidth centered at 352 MHz. The operation of VLITE requires no
additional resources from the VLA system running the primary science and
produces an ad-hoc sky survey. The commensal system greatly expands the
capabilities of the VLA through value-added PI science, stand-alone
astrophysics, the opening of a new window on transient searches, and
serendipity. In the first year of operation we have recorded more than 6300

of data to machine learning algorithms. This stock of data stands to increase
with the developments of the internet of things and cyber-physical systems.
Clearly, these technologies promise benefits. But they also raise the risk of
sensitive information disclosure. To mitigate this risk, machine learning
algorithms can add noise to outputs according to the formulations provided by
differential privacy. At the same time, users can fight for privacy by
injecting noise into the data that they report. In this paper, we conceptualize
the interactions between privacy and accuracy and between user (input)
perturbation and learner (output) perturbation in machine learning, using the
frameworks of empirical risk minimization, differential privacy, and
Stackelberg games. In particular, we solve for the Stackelberg equilibrium for
the case of an averaging query. We find that, in equilibrium, either the users
perturb their data before submission or the learner perturbs the machine
learning output, but never both. Specifically, the learner perturbs if and only
if the number of users is greater than a threshold which increases with the
degree to which incentives are misaligned. Provoked by these conclusions - and
by some observations from privacy ethics - we also suggest future directions.
While other work in this area has studied privacy markets and mechanism design
for truthful reporting of user information, we take a different viewpoint by
considering both user and learner perturbation. We hope that this effort will
open the door to future work in the area of differential privacy games.

well as to quantify systematic effects due to resolution, such as source
confusion and source size. While these effects are not new, this work is
intended as a particular case study that can be scaled and translated to other

two routines perform comparably well, with OBIT being slightly better at
de-blending sources, but slightly worse at fitting resolved sources. We show
that 30 to 70 per cent of sources are missed or fit inaccurately once the
source size becomes larger than the beam, possibly explaining source count
errors in high-resolution surveys. We also investigate the effect of blending,
finding that any sources with separations smaller than the beam size are fit as
single sources. We show that the use of machine-learning techniques can
correctly identify blended sources up to 90 per cent of the time, and
prior-driven fitting can lead to a 70 per cent improvement in the number of
de-blended sources.

build trustworthy computing platforms, especially mobile platforms. Quantifying
the efficacy of HMDs against malicious adversaries is thus an important
problem. The challenge lies in that real-world malware typically adapts to
defenses, evades being run in experimental settings, and hides behind benign
applications. Thus, realizing the potential of HMDs as a line of defense - that
has a small and battery-efficient code base - requires a rigorous foundation
for evaluating HMDs.
  To this end, we introduce EMMA - a platform to evaluate the efficacy of HMDs
for mobile platforms. EMMA deconstructs malware into atomic, orthogonal actions
and introduces a systematic way of pitting different HMDs against a diverse
subset of malware hidden inside benign applications. EMMA drives both malware
and benign programs with real user-inputs to yield an HMD's effective operating
range - i.e., the malware actions a particular HMD is capable of detecting. We
show that small atomic actions, such as stealing a Contact or SMS, have
surprisingly large hardware footprints, and use this insight to design HMD
algorithms that are less intrusive than prior work and yet perform 24.7%
better. Finally, EMMA brings up a surprising new result - obfuscation
techniques used by malware to evade static analyses makes them more detectable
using HMDs.

frustrated magnetic interactions. Consequently, the origin of spin-glass
behaviour in Y$_2$Mo$_2$O$_7$ $-$ in which magnetic Mo$^{4+}$ ions occupy a
frustrated pyrochlore lattice with minimal compositional disorder $-$ has been
a longstanding question. Here, we use neutron and X-ray pair-distribution
function (PDF) analysis to develop a disorder model that resolves apparent
incompatibilities between previously-reported PDF, EXAFS and NMR studies and
provides a new and physical mechanism for spin-glass formation. We show that
Mo$^{4+}$ ions displace according to a local ""2-in/2-out"" rule on each Mo$_4$
tetrahedron, driven by orbital dimerisation of Jahn-Teller active Mo$^{4+}$
ions. Long-range orbital order is prevented by the macroscopic degeneracy of
dimer coverings permitted by the pyrochlore lattice. Cooperative O$^{2-}$
displacements yield a distribution of Mo$-$O$-$Mo angles, which in turn
introduces disorder into magnetic interactions. Our study demonstrates
experimentally how frustration of atomic displacements can assume the role of
compositional disorder in driving a spin-glass transition.

corresponds to a single-peaked solution. Due to the size and slow rotation, the

relative locations of these extrema give a striking, and beautiful,
demonstration of what we expect from acoustic oscillations in the plasma; e.g.,
that EE peaks fall half way between TT peaks. We expect this because the
temperature map is predominantly sourced by temperature variations in the last
scattering surface, while the polarization map is predominantly sourced by
gradients in the velocity field, and the harmonic oscillations have temperature
and velocity 90 degrees out of phase. However, there are large differences in
expectations for extrema locations from simple analytic models vs. numerical
calculations. Here we quantitatively explore the origin of these differences in
gravitational potential transients, neutrino free-streaming, the breakdown of
tight coupling, the shape of the primordial power spectrum, details of the
geometric projection from three to two dimensions, and the thickness of the

specifying three new logical sorts within these signatures: isomorphism sorts,
reflexivity predicates and transport structure. The semantics for

isomorphism sorts interpreted as identity types, reflexivity predicates as
relations picking out the trivial path, and transport structure as transport
along a path. We then define a deductive system $\mathcal{D}_{\cong}$ for

extension of the global formulation of four-dimensional extended supergravity
on a differentiable spin manifold. The topology of geometric U-folds depends on
certain flat fiber bundles which encode how supergravity fields are globally
glued together. We show that smooth non-trivial U-folds of this type can exist
only in theories where both the scalar and space-time manifolds have
non-trivial fundamental group and in addition, the scalar map of the solution
is homotopically non-trivial. Consistency with string theory requires smooth
geometric U-folds to be glued using subgroups of the effective discrete
U-duality group, implying that the fundamental group of the scalar manifold of
such solutions must be a subgroup of the latter. We construct simple examples
of geometric U-folds in a generalization of the axion-dilaton model of
$\mathcal{N}=2$ supergravity coupled to a single vector multiplet, whose scalar
manifold is a generally non-compact Riemann surface of genus at least two
endowed with its uniformizing metric. We also discuss the relation between
geometric U-folds and a moduli space of flat connections defined on the scalar
manifold, which involves certain character varieties not studied in the
literature.

for torsion-free Higgs sheaves can be defined using only Higgs subsheaves with
torsion-free quotients; and we show that a classical relation between Gieseker

also prove that a direct sum of two Higgs sheaves is Gieseker semistable if and

Gieseker semistable sheaves also holds in the Higgs case; as a consequence of

such as finite temperature, sparse connectivity, small qubit numbers, and
control error. We propose new algorithms for mapping boolean constraint
satisfaction problems (CSPs) onto QA hardware mitigating these limitations. In
particular we develop a new embedding algorithm for mapping a CSP onto a
hardware Ising model with a fixed sparse set of interactions, and propose two
new decomposition algorithms for solving problems too large to map directly
into hardware.
  The mapping technique is locally-structured, as hardware compatible Ising
models are generated for each problem constraint, and variables appearing in
different constraints are chained together using ferromagnetic couplings. In
contrast, global embedding techniques generate a hardware independent Ising
model for all the constraints, and then use a minor-embedding algorithm to
generate a hardware compatible Ising model. We give an example of a class of
CSPs for which the scaling performance of D-Wave's QA hardware using the local
mapping technique is significantly better than global embedding.
  We validate the approach by applying D-Wave's hardware to circuit-based
fault-diagnosis. For circuits that embed directly, we find that the hardware is
typically able to find all solutions from a min-fault diagnosis set of size N
using 1000N samples, using an annealing rate that is 25 times faster than a
leading SAT-based sampling method. Further, we apply decomposition algorithms
to find min-cardinality faults for circuits that are up to 5 times larger than
can be solved directly on current hardware.

existing methods require pre-defining a set of types and training a multi-class

features. They are thus limited to certain domains, genres and languages. In
this paper, we propose a novel unsupervised entity typing framework by
combining symbolic and distributional semantics. We start from learning general
embeddings for each entity mention, compose the embeddings of specific contexts
using linguistic structures, link the mention to knowledge bases and learn its
related knowledge representations. Then we develop a novel joint hierarchical
clustering and linking algorithm to type all mentions using these
representations. This framework doesn't rely on any annotated data, predefined
typing schema, or hand-crafted features, therefore it can be quickly adapted to
a new domain, genre and language. Furthermore, it has great flexibility at
incorporating linguistic structures (e.g., Abstract Meaning Representation
(AMR), dependency relations) to improve specific context representation.
Experiments on genres (news and discussion forum) show comparable performance
with state-of-the-art supervised typing systems trained from a large amount of
labeled data. Results on various languages (English, Chinese, Japanese, Hausa,

constraints were placed to maintain the physical dose (PD) within 1.25 times
the prescription while maximizing target BD. For comparison, conventional IMRT
and IMPT plans were created for each case in Eclipse (Varian, Inc). The same
critical structure PD constraints were used for the IMRT, IMPT and
bio-optimized plans. The BD for the IMPT plans were obtained through MC
re-calculations. Results: Compared to standard IMPT, the bio-optimal plans for
patients with small tumor targets displayed a BD escalation that was around
twice the PD increase. Dose sparing to critical structures was improved
compared to both IMRT and IMPT. No significant BD increase could be achieved
for the large thyroid case, and when the presence of critical structures
mitigated the contribution of additional fields. The calculation of the
bio-optimized plans can be completed in a clinically viable time (<30 minutes)
on a 24-GPU system. Conclusion: By exploiting GPU acceleration, MC-based,
biologically optimized plans were created for small-target tumor patients. This
optimizer will be used in an upcoming feasibility trial on LETd painting for
radio-resistant tumors.

  switched systems","23 pages",,,,"math.DS","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  An anti-lock braking system (ABS) is the primary motivation for this
research. The ABS controller switches the actions of charging and discharging
valves in the hydraulic actuator of the brake cylinder based on the wheels'
angular speed and acceleration. The controller is, therefore, modeled by
discontinuous differential equations where two smooth vector fields are
separated by a switching manifold S. The goal of the controller is to maximize
the tire-road friction force during braking (and, in particular, to prevent the
wheel lock-up). Since the optimal slip L of the wheel is known rather
approximately, the actual goal of the controller is to achieve such a switching
strategy that makes the dynamics converging to a limit cycle surrounding the
region of prospective values of L. In this paper we show that the required
limit cycle can be obtained as a bifurcation from a point x0 of S when a
suitable parameter D crosses 0. The point x0 turns out to be a fold-fold
singularity (the vector fields on the two sides of S are tangent one another at
x0) and the parameter D measures the deviation of the switching manifold from a
hyperplane. The proposed result is based on an extension of the classical fold
bifurcation theory available for smooth maps. Construction of a suitable smooth
map is a crucial step of the proof.

feature observed by P. J. Sarre's group is the $Q$-branch of a parallel band of

Results depend on 10 parameters, with the rotational constant $B$ being the

$B$, which in turn constrains the number of heavy atoms to 5 $\leq n \leq 7$.
Upper limits based on the Her 36 spectrum and lower limits based on stability
against photodissociation are also discussed. The latter is based on the
assumption that the DIB molecules are produced top-down from the breakdown of
dust rather than bottom-up by chemical reactions.
  A difficulty with this limit is that J. P. Maier's laboratory has observed
many molecules within this size range, some of which have been tested

was observed in the microwave emission recorded by the Nobeyama Radioheliograph

was also observed in the metric and decimetric radio frequencies (25-180, 245,

SDO/AIA, Hinode/SOT, and STEREO/SECCHI suggest a fan-spine topology at the
eruption site, associated with the formation of a quasi-circular ribbon during
the flare. A small filament was observed below the fan-loops before the flare
onset. The filament rose slowly and interacted with the ambient field. This
behaviour was followed by an untwisting motion of the filament. Two different
structures of the filament showed $\sim$3-min periodic alternate rotation in

highly correlate with 3-min oscillations in a nearby sunspot. We suggest that
the periodic reconnection (modulated either by sunspot slow-mode wave or by

Moreover, the untrusted noise infusion by an eavesdropper on the trusted
receiving side breaks the security even for a purely attenuating main quantum
channel. As a method to compensate for the effect of the side-channel leakage
on the sender side, we suggest several types of manipulations on the
side-channel input. It is shown that by applying the modulated coherent light
on the input of the side channel that is optimally correlated to the modulation
on the main signal and optionally, introducing additional squeezing in the case
of the squeezed-state protocol, the negative influence of the lossy side
channel on the sender side can be completely removed. For the trusted receiving

are connected by a canonical transformation that hides ISO$(1,3+n)$, $G_{\rm

receive mass. Using a set of orthogonal functions
$\{f^{(\underline{0})},f^{(\underline{m})}\}$, generated by the Casimir
invariant $\bar{P}^2$ associated with the translations subgroup
$T(n)\subset$ISO$(n)$, we expand the degrees of freedom of ISO$(1,3+n)$,
$G_{\rm SM}({\cal M}^{4+n})$ in general Fourier series, whose coefficients are
the degrees of freedom of ISO(1,3), $G({\cal M}^{4})$. These functions, which
correspond to the projection on $\{|\bar{x}\big>\}$ of the discrete basis
$\{|0\big>,|p^{(\underline{m})}\big>\}$ of $\bar{P}^2$, are central to define
the effective theory. Components along the ground state
$f^{(\underline{0})}=\big <\bar x|0\big>$ do not receive mass at the

the classical Shannon capacity formula, which, however, may provide inaccurate
energy consumption estimation, especially when the code blocklength is finite.
In this paper, we formulate a new energy-efficient packet scheduling problem by
adopting a recently developed channel capacity formula for finite blocklength
codes. The newly formulated problem is fundamentally more challenging to solve
than the traditional one because the transmission energy function under the new
channel capacity formula neither can be expressed in closed form nor possesses
desirable monotonicity and convexity in general. We analyze conditions on the
code blocklength for which the transmission energy function is monotonic and
convex. Based on these properties, we develop efficient offline packet
scheduling algorithms as well as a rolling-window based online algorithm for
real-time packet scheduling. Simulation results demonstrate not only the
efficacy of the proposed algorithms but also the fact that the traditional
design using the Shannon capacity formula can considerably underestimate the
transmission energy for reliable communications.

initially coplanar planet-disc system that orbits a member of a misaligned
binary star evolves to form a planet that undergoes Kozai-Lidov (KL)
oscillations once the disc disperses. These oscillations may explain the large
orbital eccentricities, as well as the large misalignments with respect to the
spin of the central star, observed for some exoplanets. The planet is assumed
to be massive enough to open a gap in the disc. The planet's tilt relative to
the binary orbital plane is subject to two types of oscillations. The first
type, present at even small inclination angles relative to the binary orbital
plane, is due to the interaction of the planet with the disc and binary
companion and is amplified by a secular resonance. The second type of
oscillation is the KL oscillation that operates on both the planet and disc at
larger binary inclination angles. We find that for a sufficiently massive disc,
even a relatively low inclination planet-disc system can force a planet to an
inclination above the critical KL angle, as a consequence of the first type of
tilt oscillation, allowing it to undergo the second type of oscillation. We
conclude that the hydrodynamical evolution of a sufficiently massive and
inclined disc in a binary system broadens the range of systems that form
eccentric and misaligned giant planets to include a wide range of initial
misalignment angles (20 to 160 degrees).

spin degrees of freedom of a relativistic particle, either massive or massless,
is associated with a vortex line. %The formulation in cylindrical coordinates
leads to a local vortex structure related to orbital angular momentum(OAM).
Based on cylindrical corodinate formulation, which leads to a local vortex
structure related to orbital angular momentum (OAM), it can be shown that when
electron vortex beams (EVBs) move in an external electric field paraxial beams
give rise to OAM Hall effect and non-paraxial beams with tilted vortices
initiate spin Hall effect in free space as well as in an external field. A
similar analysis reveals that the paraxial optical vortex beams(OVBs) in an
inhomogeneous medium induce OAM Hall effect whereas non-paraxial beams with
tilted vortices drive the spin Hall effect. Moreover, both OVBs and EVBs with
tilted vortices give rise to OAM states with arbitrary fractional value.

obtain the evolution of longitudinally polarized parton densities of hadrons up

for the NNLO calculations of the polarized parton distribution functions as
well as the proton, neutron and deuteron polarized structure functions are
compared with the corresponding results of the NLO approximation. We form a
mutually consistent set of polarized PDFs due to the inclusion of the most
available experimental data including the recently high-precision measurements

recently incorporated the decoding approach, allowing for fMRI to be used as a
tool for manipulation of fine-grained neural activity. Because of the
tremendous potential for clinical applications, certain questions regarding
decoded neurofeedback (DecNef) must be addressed. Neurofeedback effects can
last for months, but the short- to mid-term dynamics are not known.
Specifically, can the same subjects learn to induce neural patterns in two
opposite directions in different sessions? This leads to a further question,
whether learning to reverse a neural pattern may be less effective after
training to induce it in a previous session. Here we employed a
within-subjects' design, with subjects undergoing DecNef training sequentially
in opposite directions (up or down regulation of confidence judgements in a
perceptual task), with the order counterbalanced across subjects. Behavioral
results indicated that the manipulation was strongly influenced by the order
and direction of neurofeedback. We therefore applied nonlinear mathematical
modeling to parametrize four main consequences of DecNef: main effect of change
in behavior, strength of down-regulation effect relative to up-regulation,
maintenance of learning over sessions, and anterograde learning interference.
Modeling results revealed that DecNef successfully induced bidirectional
behavioral changes in different sessions. Furthermore, up-regulation was more
sizable, and the effect was largely preserved even after an interval of
one-week. Lastly, the second week effect was diminished as compared to the
first week effect, indicating strong anterograde learning interference. These
results suggest reinforcement learning characteristics of DecNef, and provide
important constraints on its application to basic neuroscience, occupational
and sports trainings, and therapies.

$\varphi(t)=t^2$ and $\psi(t)=t$, the corresponding $\varphi$-SLWP and

minimum respectively, which have been extensively studied in recent years. We
discover an interesting relationship between two admissible functions $\varphi$

semicontinous function $f$ on a Banach space has $\varphi$-SLWP if and only if
$f$ has $\psi$-TSLM. Using the techniques of variational analysis and conjugate

so-called monodromy relation, an identity connecting the three-point functions
with and without the insertion of the monodromy matrix. We shall show that this
relation can be put to use directly for the semi-classical regime, where the
dynamics is governed by the classical Landau-Lifshitz sigma model.
Specifically, it reduces the problem to a set of functional equations, which
can be solved once the analyticity in the spectral parameter space is
specified. To determine the analyticity, we develop a new universal logic
applicable at both weak and strong couplings. As a result, compact
semi-classical formulas are obtained for a general class of three-point
functions at weak coupling including the ones whose semi-classical behaviors
were not known before. In addition, the new analyticity argument applied to the
strong coupling analysis leads to a modification of the integration contour,
producing the results consistent with the recent hexagon bootstrap approach.
This modification also makes the Frolov-Tseytlin limit perfectly agree with the
weak coupling form.

to their adhesion and rolling forces in a theoretical model based on the
contact mechanics. Here we revisit the cohesion of amorphous silica spheres by
compiling available data on the surface energy for hydrophilic amorphous silica
in various circumstances. It turned out that the surface energy for hydrophilic
amorphous silica in a vacuum is a factor of 10 higher than previously assumed.
Therefore, the previous theoretical models underestimated the critical velocity
for the sticking of amorphous silica spheres, as well as the rolling friction
forces between them. With the most plausible value of the surface energy for
amorphous silica spheres, theoretical models based on the contact mechanics are
in harmony with laboratory experiments. Consequently, we conclude that silicate
grains with a radius of $0.1~\mu$m could grow to planetesimals via coagulation
in a protoplanetary disk. We argue that the coagulation growth of silicate

icy mantles or, if there are no mantles, by nanometer-sized grain radius.

formulate the stability problem as a free boundary problem for nonlinear

reduce the free boundary problem into a fixed boundary value problem near a

multiple correspondence analysis (MCA). %It is well suited to discover
relations that may exist between categories of different variables. The
graphical representation of MCA results in so-called biplots makes it easy to
interpret the most important associations. However, a major drawback of MCA is
that it does not have an underlying probability model for an individual
selecting a category on a variable. In this paper, we propose such probability
model called multinomial multiple correspondence analysis (MMCA) that combines
the underlying low-rank representation of MCA with maximum likelihood. An
efficient majorization algorithm that uses an elegant bound for the second
derivative is derived to estimate the parameters. The proposed model can easily
lead to overfitting causing some of the parameters to wander of to infinity. We
add the nuclear norm penalty to counter this issue and discuss ways of
selecting regularization parameters. The proposed approach is well suited to
study and vizualise the dependences for high dimensional data.

observed extremes in the FCN amplitude and phase variations are close to the
GMJ epochs. In this paper, a new evidence of this connection was found. The
large FCN amplitude and phase disturbance occurred at the epoch close to the
newly revealed GMJ 2011. This event occurred to be the second large change in
the FCN amplitude and phase after the 1999 disturbance that is also associated
with the GMJ 1999. Moreover, the long-time FCN phase drift had changed suddenly
in 1998--1999, immediately before the GMJ 1999, and seemed to change again at
the epoch immediately preceding the GMJ 2011. The FCN amplitude showed a
general long-time decrease before GMJ 1999, and it subsequently grew until GMJ
2011, and then seemed to decrease again. A smaller FCN change can be observed
at the epoch around 2013, which is also suspected as the GMJ epoch. The latter
confirms the suggestion that a rapid change in the FCN amplitude and/or phase
can be used as an evidence of the GMJ that is not clearly detected from the

Dolidze 25, which has the lowest metallicity measured in a Milky Way young

with two early B-type components. We set out to derive its orbital and stellar
parameters. Methods. We present a comprehensive analysis, including B and V
light curves and 11 high-resolution spectra, to verify the orbital period and
determine parameters. We use the stellar atmosphere code FASTWIND to obtain
stellar parameters and create templates for cross-correlation. We obtain a
model to fit the light and radial-velocity curves using the Wilson-Devinney
code iteratively and simultaneously. Results. The two components of GU Mon are
identical stars of spectral type B1 V, with the same mass and temperature. The
lightcurves are typical of an EW-type binary. The spectroscopic and photometric
analyses agree on a period of 0.896640 +- 0.000007 d. We determine a mass of
9.0 +- 0.6 Msun for each component and temperatures of 28 000 +- 2 000 K. Both
values are consistent with the spectral type. The two stars are overfilling
their respective Roche lobes, sharing a common envelope, and therefore the
orbit is synchronised and circularised. Conclusions. The GU Mon system has a
fill-out factor above 0.8, containing two dwarf B-type stars on the main
sequence. The two stars are in a very advanced stage of interaction, with their
extreme physical similarity likely due to the common envelope. The expected
evolution of such a system will very probably lead to a merger while still on
the main sequence.

space to a Hamming cube in lower dimension while preserving pairwise distances.
An efficient way to accomplish this is to make use of fast embedding techniques
involving Fourier transform e.g.~circulant matrices. While binary embedding has
been studied extensively, theoretical results on fast binary embedding are
rather limited. In this work, we build upon the recent literature to obtain
significantly better dependencies on the problem parameters. A set of $N$
points in $\mathbb{R}^n$ can be properly embedded into the Hamming cube $\{\pm
1\}^k$ with $\delta$ distortion, by using $k\sim\delta^{-3}\log N$ samples
which is optimal in the number of points $N$ and compares well with the optimal
distortion dependency $\delta^{-2}$. Our optimal embedding result applies in
the regime $\log N\lesssim n^{1/3}$. Furthermore, if the looser condition $\log
N\lesssim \sqrt{n}$ holds, we show that all but an arbitrarily small fraction
of the points can be optimally embedded. We believe our techniques can be
useful to obtain improved guarantees for other nonlinear embedding problems.

impacting a solid surface, extending prior work to the regime where the

behavior can be described by a combination of two trends. The first one is that
the splashing becomes favored when the kinetic energy of individual particles
at the surface of a droplet overcomes the confinement produced by surface
tension. This is expressed by a particle-based Weber number $We_p$. The second
is that splashing is suppressed by increasing the viscosity of the solvent.
This is expressed by the Stokes number $St$, which influences the effective
coefficient of restitution of colliding particles. We developed a phase diagram
where the splashing onset is delineated as a function of both $We_p$ and $St$.
A surprising result occurs at very small Stokes number, where not only
splashing is suppressed but also plastic deformation of the droplet. This leads
to a situation where droplets can bounce back after impact, an observation we
are able to reproduce using discrete particle numerical simulations that take
into account viscous interaction between particles and elastic energy.

condensate (BEC) of neutral atoms interacting via the magnetic dipole-dipole

and the relative orbital angular momentum of two colliding atoms, it works as a
spin-orbit coupling. Thus, when we prepare a BEC in a magnetic sublevel $m=0$,
thermally and quantum-mechanically excited atoms in the $m=1$ and $-1$ states
feel the Lorentz-like foces in the opposite directions. This is the origin for
the emergence of the the spin Hall effect. We define the mass-current and
spin-current operators from the equations of continuity and calculate the spin
Hall conductivity from the off-diagonal current-current correlation function
within the Bogoliubov approximation. We find that the correction of the current
operators due to the MDDI significantly contributes to the spin Hall
conductivity. Possible experimental situation is also discussed.

that have been proposed as building blocks of fault-tolerant quantum computers
[1]. They are expected to exhibit non-Abelian particle statistics, in contrast
to the usual statistics of fermions and bosons, enabling quantum operations to
be performed by braiding isolated modes around one another. Quantum braiding
operations are topologically protected insofar as these modes are pinned near
zero energy, and the pinning is predicted to be exponential as the modes become
spatially separated. Following theoretical proposals, several experiments have
identified signatures of Majorana modes in proximitized nanowires and atomic
chains, with small mode-splitting potentially explained by hybridization of
Majoranas. Here, we use Coulomb-blockade spectroscopy in an InAs nanowire
segment with epitaxial aluminum, which forms a proximity-induced
superconducting Coulomb island (a Majorana island) that is isolated from
normal-metal leads by tunnel barriers, to measure the splitting of
near-zero-energy Majorana modes. We observe exponential suppression of energy
splitting with increasing wire length. For short devices of a few hundred
nanometers, sub-gap state energies oscillate as the magnetic field is varied,
as is expected for hybridized Majorana modes. Splitting decreases by a factor
of about ten for each half micrometer of increased wire length. For devices
longer than about one micrometer, transport in strong magnetic fields occurs
through a zero-energy state that is energetically isolated from a continuum,
yielding uniformly spaced Coulomb-blockade conductance peaks, consistent with
teleportation via Majorana modes. Our results help explain the
trivial-to-topological transition in finite systems and to quantify the scaling
of topological protection with end-mode separation.

Start with particles
located at the vertices of the lattice, initially distributed according to the
product Bernoulli measure with parameter \mu. In addition, there is an
aggregate, which initially consists of the origin. Non-aggregated particles
move as continuous time simple random walks obeying the exclusion rule, whereas
aggregated particles do not move. The aggregate grows by attaching particles to
its surface whenever a particle attempts to jump onto it. This evolution is
referred to as multi-particle diffusion limited aggregation.
  Our main result states that if on d>1 the initial density of particles is
large enough, then with positive probability the aggregate has linearly growing
arms, i.e. if F(t) denotes the point of the aggregate furthest away from the
origin at time t>0, then there exists a constant c>0 so that |F(t)|>ct, for all
t eventually.
  The key conceptual element of our analysis is the introduction and study of a
new growth process. Consider a first passage percolation process, called type
1, starting from the origin. Whenever type 1 is about to occupy a new vertex,
with positive probability, instead of doing it, it gives rise to another first
passage percolation process, called type 2, which starts to spread from that
vertex. Each vertex gets occupied only by the process that arrives to it first.
This process may have three phases: an extinction phase, where type 1 gets
eventually surrounded by type 2 clusters, a coexistence phase, where infinite
clusters of both types emerge, and a strong survival phase, where type 1
produces an infinite cluster that successfully surrounds all type 2 clusters.
Understanding the behavior of this process in its various phases is of
mathematical interest on its own right. We establish the existence of a strong
survival phase, and use this to show our main result.

However, NARIMA models are especially useful when the structure of the graph,

detected with the Atacama Large Millimetre Array (ALMA). A1689-zD1 is also
unusual among high-redshift dust emitters as it is a sub-L* galaxy and is
therefore a good prospect for the detection of gaseous ISM in a more typical

with the Green Bank Telescope (GBT) in band $Q$. To study the structure of
A1689-zD1, we map the mm thermal dust emission and find two spatial components
with sizes about $0.4-1.7$\,kpc (lensing-corrected). The rough spatial
morphology is similar to what is observed in the near-infrared with {\it HST}
and points to a perturbed dynamical state, perhaps indicative of a major merger
or a disc in early formation. The ALMA photometry is used to constrain the
far-infrared spectral energy distribution, yielding a dust temperature ($T_{\rm

rays (UHECRs) interact with the background radiation fields. These interactions
give rise to energetic electron/positron pairs and photons which in turn feed
electromagnetic cascades, contributing to the isotropic gamma-ray background
(IGRB). The gamma-ray flux level generated in this way highly depends upon the
UHECR propagation distance, as well as the evolution of their sources with
redshift. Recently, the Fermi-LAT collaboration reported that the majority of
the total extragalactic gamma-ray flux originates from extragalactic point
sources. This posits a stringent upper limit on the IGRB generated via UHECR
propagation, and subsequently constrains their abundance in the distant
Universe. Focusing on the contribution of UHECR at energies below the ankle
within a narrow energy band ($(1-4)\times 10^{18}$eV), we calculate the diffuse
gamma-ray flux generated through UHECR propagation, normalizing the total
cosmic ray energy budget in this band to that measured. We find that in order
to not over-produce the new IGRB limit, a local ""fog"" of UHECR produced by
nearby sources may exist, with a possible non-negligible contribution from our
Galaxy. Following the assumption that a given fraction of the observed IGRB at
820GeV originates from UHECR, we obtain a constraint on the maximum distance
for the majority of their sources. With other unresolved source populations
still contaminating the new IGRB limit, and UHECR above the ankle invariably
contributing also to this background, the results presented here are rather
conservative.

penalization, an equality based terminal constraint is proposed to ensure
stability, which enforces the terminal states of each node in the predictive
horizon equal to the average of its neighboring states. By using the sum of
local cost functions as a Lyapunov candidate, it is proved that asymptotic

researchers to collect signature samples. Distinct characteristics of Persian
signature demands for richer and culture-dependent offline signature datasets.
This paper introduces a new and public Persian offline signature dataset,
UTSig, that consists of 8280 images from 115 classes. Each class has 27 genuine
signatures, 3 opposite-hand signatures, and 42 skilled forgeries made by 6
forgers. Compared with the other public datasets, UTSig has more samples, more
classes, and more forgers. We considered various variables including signing
period, writing instrument, signature box size, and number of observable
samples for forgers in the data collection procedure. By careful examination of
main characteristics of offline signature datasets, we observe that Persian
signatures have fewer numbers of branch points and end points. We propose and
evaluate four different training and test setups for UTSig. Results of our
experiments show that training genuine samples along with opposite-hand samples
and random forgeries can improve the performance in terms of equal error rate
and minimum cost of log likelihood ratio.

two fields of a combined 50 $deg^2$ observed for more than 6Ms with XMM-Newton,
occupying the parameter space between deep surveys and very wide area surveys;
at the same time it benefits from a wealth of ancillary data. This paper marks
the first release of the XXL point source catalogue selected in the 2-10 keV
energy band with limiting flux
$F_{2-10keV}=4.8\cdot10^{-14}\rm{erg\,s^{-1}\,cm^{-2}}$. We use both public and
proprietary data sets to identify the counterparts of the X-ray point-like
sources and improved upon the photometric redshift determination for AGN by
applying a Random Forest classification trained to identify for each object the
optimal photometric redshift model library. We also assign a probability to
each source to be a star or an outlier. We model with Bayesian analysis the
X-ray spectra assuming a power-law model with the presence of an absorbing
medium. We find an average unabsorbed photon index of $\Gamma=1.85$ and average
hydrogen column density $\log{N_{H}}=21.07 cm^{-2}$. We find no trend of
$\Gamma$ or $N_H$ with redshift and a fraction of 26% absorbed sources ($\log
N_{H}>22$). We show that the XXL-1000-AGN number counts extended the number
counts of the COSMOS survey to higher fluxes and are fully consistent with the
Euclidean expectation. We constrain the intrinsic luminosity function of AGN in
the 2-10 keV energy band where the unabsorbed X-ray flux is estimated from the
X-ray spectral fit up to z=3. Finally, we demonstrate the presence of a
supercluster size structure at redshift 0.14, identified by means of
percolation analysis of the XXL-1000-AGN sample. The XXL survey, reaching a

unprecedented control over interlayer interactions by locally modifying the
interlayer separation between graphene and boron nitride, which we achieve by
applying pressure with a scanning tunneling microscopy tip. For the special

In many transitional metal oxides, charge ordering and magnetic ordering
coexist, so that a method of engineering charge-ordered materials into
ferroelectric materials would lead to a large class of multiferroic materials.
We propose a strategy for designing new ferroelectric or even multiferroic
materials by inserting a spacing layer into each two layers of charge-ordered
materials and artificially making a superlattice. One example of the model
demonstrated here is the perovskite (LaFeO$_3$)$_2$/LaTiO$_3$ (111)
superlattice, in which the LaTiO$_3$ layer acts as the donor and the spacing
layer, and the LaFeO$_3$ layer is half doped and performs charge ordering. The
collaboration of the charge ordering and the spacing layer breaks the space
inversion symmetry, resulting in a large ferroelectric polarization. As the
charge ordering also leads to a ferrimagnetic structure, the
(LaFeO$_3$)$_2$/LaTiO$_3$ is multiferroic. It is expected that this work can
encourage the designing and experimentally implementation of a large class of
multiferroic structures with novel properties.

$S^*$ is an extension of NFU, and may be seen as an attempt to accommodate
unrestricted categories such as the category of all groups (without any
small/large restrictions), while still obtaining the benefits of ZFC on part of
the domain. A substantial part of the paper is devoted to establishing an
improved upper bound on the consistency strength of $S^*$. The assessment of
$S^*$ as a foundation of category theory is framed by the following general
desiderata (R) and (S). (R) asks for the unrestricted existence of the category
of all groups, the category of all categories, the category of all functors
between two categories, etc., along with natural implementability of ordinary
mathematics and category theory. (S) asks for a certain relative distinction
between large and small sets, and the requirement that they both enjoy the full
benefits of the $\mathrm{ZFC}$ axioms. $S^*$ satisfies (R) simply because it is
an extension of NFU. By means of a recursive construction utilizing the notion
of strongly cantorian sets, we argue that it also satisfies (S). Moreover, this
construction yields a lower bound on the consistency strength of $S^*$. We also
exhibit a basic positive result for category theory internal to NFU that
provides motivation for studying NFU-based foundations of category theory.

discriminator between competing formation theories, but has not been well
characterised. Additionally, contaminating light from unresolved stars can
significantly affect the accuracy of photometric and spectroscopic measurements
in studies of transiting exoplanets. Aims. We observed 101 transiting exoplanet
host systems in the Southern hemisphere in order to create a homogeneous
catalogue of both bound companion stars and contaminating background stars. We
investigate the binary fraction among the host stars in order to test theories
for the formation of hot Jupiters, in an area of the sky where transiting
exoplanetary systems have not been systematically searched for stellar
companions. Methods. Lucky imaging observations from the Two Colour Instrument
on the Danish 1.54m telescope at La Silla were used to search for previously
unresolved stars at small angular separations. The separations and relative
magnitudes of all detected stars were measured. For 12 candidate companions to
10 host stars, previous astrometric measurements were used to evaluate how
likely the companions are to be physically associated. Results. We provide
measurements of 499 candidate companions within 20 arcseconds of our sample of
101 planet host stars. 51 candidates are located within 5 arcseconds of a host
star, and we provide the first published measurements for 27 of these.
Calibrations for the plate scale and colour performance of the Two Colour
Instrument are presented. Conclusions. We find that the overall multiplicity
rate of the host stars is 38 +17 -13%, consistent with the rate among
solar-type stars in our sensitivity range, suggesting that planet formation
does not preferentially occur in long period binaries compared to a random
sample of field stars.

results obtained with these two approaches are in good agreement in the linear
regime, while a dramatic speed-up of the flavor conversions occurs in the

need for architectures to handle billions of devices and their interactions. A
virtual world engine at the massively multiplayer scale is a massively
multiplayer online world (MMOW); one thing virtual world engines realized when
going into the scale of MMOs, is the cost of maintaining a potentially
quadratic number of interactions between a massive number of objects, laid out
in a spatial dimension. Research into IoT was fueled by research in wireless
sensor networks, but rather than start from a device perspective, this article
looks at how architectures deal with interacting entities at large scale. The
domain of MMOWs is examined for properties that are affected by scale.
Thereafter the domain of IoT is evaluated to see if each of those properties
are found and how each is handled. By comparing the current state of the art of
MMOWs and IoT, with respect to scalability, the problem of scaling IoT is
explicated, as well as the problem of incorporating an MMOW with IoT into a
pervasive platform. Three case studies of a MMOW interfacing with IoT are
presented in closing.

The X-ray spectrum in 0.2-10 keV can be characterized by an absorbed power-law
plus soft excess and an Fe K$\alpha$ emission line. The power-law spectral
index remains constant during the flux variation. The absorbing material is
mildly ionized, with a column density of 3.2$\times$10$^{21}$ cm$^{-2}$, and
does not appear to vary during the period of the X-ray observation. If the same
material causes the optical reddening (E(B-V)$\simeq$0.6 mag), it must be
located outside the narrow line region with a dust-to-gas ratio similar to the
average Galactic value. We detect significant variations of the Fe K$\alpha$
line during the observational period. A broad Fe K$\alpha$ line at $\simeq$6.7
keV with a width of $\sim$0.6 keV is detected in the low flux segment of the
first 40 ks exposure, and is absent in the spectra of other segments; a narrow
Fe K$\alpha$ emission line $\sim$6.4 keV with a width of $\sim$0.1 keV is
observed in the subsequent 20 ks segment, which has a count rate of 35% higher
and is in the next day. We believe this is due to the change in geometry and
kinematics of the X-ray emitting corona. The temperature and flux of soft X-ray
excess appear to correlate with the flux of the hard power-law component.
Comptonization of disc photons by a warm and optically thick inner disk is
preferred to interpret the soft excess, rather than the ionized reflection.

study how nearby trajectories diverge from one another. These allow for
efficient and reliable determinations of chaos indicators such as the Maximal
Lyapunov characteristic Exponent (MLE) and the Mean Exponential Growth factor
of Nearby Orbits (MEGNO).
  In this paper we lay out the theoretical framework to extend the idea of
variational equations to higher order. We explicitly derive the differential
equations that govern the evolution of second-order variations in the N-body
problem. Going to second order opens the door to new applications, including
optimization algorithms that require the first and second derivatives of the
solution, like the classical Newton's method. Typically, these methods have
faster convergence rates than derivative-free methods. Derivatives are also
required for Riemann manifold Langevin and Hamiltonian Monte Carlo methods
which provide significantly shorter correlation times than standard methods.
Such improved optimization methods can be applied to anything from
radial-velocity/transit-timing-variation fitting to spacecraft trajectory
optimization to asteroid deflection.
  We provide an implementation of first and second-order variational equations
for the publicly available REBOUND integrator package. Our implementation
allows the simultaneous integration of any number of first and second-order
variational equations with the high-accuracy IAS15 integrator. We also provide
routines to generate consistent and accurate initial conditions without the
need for finite differencing.

bounded in a neighbourhood of the origin, then the moments of all order are
finite and the class of polynomials is dense in $L^2$. The existence of the
moments of all orders is well known for the case where the measure is

concerning the polynomial approximation is original, even thought the proof is
relatively simple. Additionally, an alternative stronger condition easier to be

clusters is not well constrained due to the very high plasma temperature.
Therefore, the plasma is often assumed to be homogeneous. A non-uniform Helium
distribution can however lead to biases when measuring key cluster parameters.
This has motivated one-dimensional models that evolve the ICM composition
assuming that the effects of magnetic fields can be parameterized or ignored.
Such models for non-isothermal clusters show that Helium can sediment in the
cluster core leading to a peak in concentration offset from the cluster center.
The resulting profiles have recently been shown to be linearly unstable when
the weakly-collisional character of the magnetized plasma is considered. In
this paper, we present a modified version of the MHD code Athena, which makes
it possible to evolve a weakly-collisional plasma subject to a gravitational
field and stratified in both temperature and composition. We thoroughly test
our implementation and confirm excellent agreement against several analytical
results. In order to isolate the effects of composition, in this initial study
we focus our attention on isothermal plasmas. We show that plasma
instabilities, feeding off gradients in composition, can induce turbulent
mixing and saturate by re-arranging magnetic field lines and alleviating the
composition gradient. Composition profiles that increase with radius lead to
instabilities that saturate by driving the average magnetic field inclination
to roughly $45^{\circ}$. We speculate that this effect may alleviate the core
insulation observed in homogeneous settings, with potential consequences for
the associated cooling flow problem.

theory are based on Monte Carlo's importance sampling method, i.e. on
probability interpretation of the Boltzmann weight. Unfortunately in many
theories of interest one cannot associated a real and positive weight to every
configuration, that is because their action is explicitly complex or because
the weight is multiplied by some non positive term. In this cases one says that
the theory on the lattice is affected by the sign problem. An outstanding
example of sign problem preventing a quantum field theory to be studied, is QCD
at finite chemical potential. Whenever the sign problem is present, standard
Monte Carlo methods are problematic to apply and, in general, new approaches
are needed to explore the phase diagram of the complex theory. Here we will
review three of the main candidate methods to deal with the sign problem,
namely complex Langevin dynamics, Lefschetz thimbles and density of states
method. We will first study complex Langevin dynamics, combined with the gauge
cooling method, on the one-dimensional Polyakov line model, and then we will
apply it to pure gauge Yang-Mills theory with a topological theta-term. It

thimbles method on three toy models, which are the quartic model, the U(1)
one-link model with a mu dependent determinant, and the SU(2) non abelian
