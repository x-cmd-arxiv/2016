are widely used in engineering turbulence modeling. However, the RANS
predictions have large model-form uncertainties for many complex flows.
Quantification of these large uncertainties originating from the modeled
Reynolds stresses has attracted attention in turbulence modeling community.
Recently, a physics-based Bayesian framework for quantifying model-form
uncertainties has been proposed with successful applications to several flows.
Nonetheless, how to specify proper priors without introducing unwarranted,
artificial information remains challenging to the current form of the
physics-based approach. Another recently proposed method based on random matrix
theory provides the prior distributions with the maximum entropy, which is an
alternative for model-form uncertainty quantification in RANS simulations. In
this work, we utilize the random matrix theoretic approach to assess and
possibly improve the specification of priors used in the physics-based
approach. The numerical results show that, to achieve maximum entropy in the
prior of Reynolds stresses, the perturbations of shape parameters in
Barycentric coordinates are normally distributed. Moreover, the perturbations
of the turbulence kinetic energy should conform to log-normal distributions.
Finally, it sheds light on how large the variance of each physical variable
should be compared with each other to achieve the approximate maximum entropy
prior. The conclusion can be used as a guidance for specifying proper priors in
the physics-based, Bayesian uncertainty quantification framework.

velocities of the outflowing components range between ~0.1c and ~0.4c. A strong
emission line at ~6.8 keV accompanied by a significant absorption line at ~7.8

a characteristic feature of a P-Cygni profile supporting the presence of an
expanding outflowing highly ionized iron absorber in this quasar. Modeling of
the P-Cygni profile constrains the covering factor of the wind to be > 0.6,
assuming disk shielding. A disk-reflection component is detected in the
XMM-Newton observation accompanied by blueshifted absorption lines. The
XMM-Newton observation constrains the inclination angle to be < 45 degrees at
90% confidence, assuming the hard excess is due to blurred reflection from the
accretion disk. The detection of an ultrafast and wide-angle wind in an AGN

may couple efficiently with the intergalactic medium and provide significant

an inner PI (proportional-integral) or PID (proportional-integral-derivative)
control loop and an outer user-specified control loop. The existing outer loop
controllers, however, do not take into consideration the dynamic effects of
robots and their effectiveness relies on the ad hoc assumption that the inner
PI or PID control loop is fast enough, and other torque-based control
algorithms cannot be implemented in robotics with closed architecture. This
paper investigates the adaptive control of robotic systems with an inner/outer
loop structure, taking into full account the effects of the dynamics and the
system uncertainties, and both the task-space control and joint-space control
are considered. We propose a dynamic modularity approach to resolve this issue,
and a class of adaptive outer loop control schemes is proposed and their role
is to dynamically generate the joint velocity (or position) command for the
low-level joint servoing loop. Without relying on the ad hoc assumption that
the joint servoing is fast enough or the modification of the low-level joint
controller structure, we rigorously show that the proposed outer loop
controllers can ensure the stability and convergence of the closed-loop system.
We also propose the outer loop versions of several standard joint-space
direct/composite adaptive controllers for rigid or flexible-joint robots, and a
promising conclusion may be that most torque-based adaptive controllers for
robots can be designed to fit the inner/outer loop structure by using the new
definition of the joint velocity (or position) command. Simulation results are
provided to show the performance of various adaptive outer loop controllers,
using a three-DOF (degree-of-freedom) manipulator, and experiment results using

requires a representation of the diffusion field in terms of a sequence

Although Karhunen-Lo\`eve representations are commonly used, it was recently
shown, in the relevant case of lognormal diffusion fields, that they do not
generally yield optimal approximation rates. Motivated by these results, we
construct wavelet-type representations of stationary Gaussian random fields

wavelets are studied, and used to obtain polynomial approximation results for
the related elliptic PDE which outperform those achievable when using
Karhunen-Lo\`eve representations. Our construction is based on a periodic
extension of the random field, and the expansion on the domain is then obtained
by simple restriction. This makes the approach easily applicable even when the
computational domain of the PDE has a complicated geometry. In particular, we
apply this construction to the class of Gaussian processes defined by the
family of Mat\'ern covariances.

using the natural solar wind as a thrust source. The problem of secular
spinrate change was identified earlier which is due to the orbital Coriolis
effect and tends to slowly increase or decrease the sail's spinrate, depending
on which way the sail is inclined with respect to the solar wind. Here we
present an E-sail design and its associated control algorithm which enable
spinrate control during propulsive flight by the E-sail effect itself. In the
design, every other maintether (""T-tether"") is galvanically connected through
the remote unit with the two adjacent auxtethers, while the other maintethers
(""I-tethers"") are insulated from the tethers. This enables one to effectively
control the maintether and auxtether voltages separately, which in turn enables
spinrate control. We use a detailed numerical simulation to show that the
algorithm can fully control the E-sail's spin state in real solar wind. The
simulation includes a simple and realistic set of controller sensors: an imager
to detect remote unit angular positions and a vector accelerometer. The imager
resolution requirement is modest and the accelerometer noise requirement is
feasible to achieve. The TI tether rig enables building E-sails that are able
to control their spin state fully and yet are actuated by pure tether voltage
modulation from the main spacecraft and requiring no functionalities from the
remote units during flight.

community structure and the evolution of the internal structure of communities
in growing social networks. The model comprises two complementary mechanisms:
One mechanism accounts for the evolution of the internal link structure of a
single community, and the second mechanism coordinates the growth of multiple
overlapping communities. The first mechanism is based on the assumption that
each node establishes links with its neighbors and introduces new nodes to the
community at different rates. We demonstrate that this simple mechanism gives
rise to an effective maximal degree within communities. This observation is
related to the anthropological theory known as Dunbar's number, i.e., the
empirical observation of a maximal number of ties which an average individual
can sustain within its social groups. The second mechanism is based on a
recently proposed generalization of preferential attachment to community
structure, appropriately called structural preferential attachment (SPA). The
combination of these two mechanisms into a single model (SPA+) allows us to
reproduce a number of the global statistics of real networks: The distribution
of community sizes, of node memberships and of degrees. The SPA+ model also
predicts (a) three qualitative regimes for the degree distribution within
overlapping communities and (b) strong correlations between the number of
communities to which a node belongs and its number of connections within each
community. We present empirical evidence that support our findings in real
complex networks.

best-known lossy Gray-Wyner region for discrete sources can also be achieved
using polar codes. With regard to the Gaussian sources, the best-known lossy
Gray-Wyner region for bivariate Gaussian sources with a specific covariance

extracting Wyner's common information of a pair of Gaussian sources is
equivalent to implementing the lossy compression for a single Gaussian source,

(2015). They showed how symmetry can be effectively restored via the adjustment
of individual gates voltages, but they make the assumption of infinite on-dot
and inter-dot interaction strengths. A related problem is the difference in the
magnitudes between the on-dot and interdot strengths for capacitively coupled
quantum dots. Here we examine both factors, based on a two site Anderson model,
using the numerical renormalization group to calculate the local spectral
densities on the dots and the renormalized parameters that specify the low
energy fixed point. Our results support the conclusions of Tosi et al. that low
energy SU(4) symmetry can be restored, but asymptotically achieved only if the
inter-dot interaction $U_{12}$ is greater than or of the order of the band
width of the coupled conduction bath $D$, which might be difficult to achieve
experimentally. By comparing the SU(4) Kondo results for a total dot occupation
$n_{\rm tot}=1$ and $n_{\rm tot}=2$ we conclude that the temperature dependence
of the conductance is largely determined by the constraints of the Friedel sum
rule rather than the SU(4) symmetry and suggest that an initial increase of the
conductance with temperature is a distinguishing characteristic feature of an
$n_{\rm tot}=1$ universal SU(4) fixed point.

transport problems: this includes the far-field reflector problem, Alexandrov's
curvature prescription problem, etc. A popular way to solve these problems
numerically is to assume that the source probability measure is absolutely
continuous while the target measure is finitely supported. We refer to this
setting as semi-discrete optimal transport. Among the several algorithms
proposed to solve semi-discrete optimal transport problems, one currently needs
to choose between algorithms that are slow but come with a convergence speed
analysis (e.g. Oliker-Prussner) or algorithms that are much faster in practice
but which come with no convergence guarantees Algorithms of the first kind rely
on coordinate-wise increments and the number of iterations required to reach
the solution up to an error of $\epsilon$ is of order $N^3/\epsilon$, where $N$
is the number of Dirac masses in the target measure. On the other hand,
algorithms of the second kind typically rely on the formulation of the
semi-discrete optimal transport problem as an unconstrained convex optimization
problem which is solved using a Newton or quasi-Newton method.
  The purpose of this article is to bridge this gap between theory and practice
by introducing a damped Newton's algorithm which is experimentally efficient
and by proving the global convergence of this algorithm with optimal rates. The
main assumptions is that the cost function satisfies a condition that appears
in the regularity theory for optimal transport (the Ma-Trudinger-Wang
condition) and that the support of the source density is connected in a
quantitative way (it must satisfy a weighted Poincar\'e-Wirtinger inequality).

break appears at the pulse frequency which separates the zero slope at low

momentum to the neutron star could be due to the accretion of a quasi-spherical

is spontaneously broken to SO(4), and the pNGBs form an isospin doublet field,
which corresponds to the Higgs doublet in the Standard Model (SM). Predicted
coupling constants of the Higgs boson can in general deviate from the SM
predictions, depending on the compositeness parameter. The deviation pattern is
determined also by the detail of the matter sector. We comprehensively study
how the model can be tested via measuring single and double production
processes of the Higgs boson at LHC and future electron-positron colliders. The
possibility to distinguish the matter sector among the minimal composite Higgs
models is also discussed. In addition, we point out differences in the cross
section of double Higgs boson production from the prediction in other new
physics models.

table? How about pushing a desk against a wall? In this paper, we study the
problem of understanding the movements of objects as a result of applying
external forces to them. For a given force vector applied to a specific
location in an image, our goal is to predict long-term sequential movements
caused by that force. Doing so entails reasoning about scene geometry, objects,
their attributes, and the physical rules that govern the movements of objects.
We design a deep neural network model that learns long-term sequential
dependencies of object movements while taking into account the geometry and
appearance of the scene by combining Convolutional and Recurrent Neural
Networks. Training our model requires a large-scale dataset of object movements
caused by external forces. To build a dataset of forces in scenes, we
reconstructed all images in SUN RGB-D dataset in a physics simulator to
estimate the physical movements of objects caused by external forces applied to
them. Our Forces in Scenes (ForScene) dataset contains 10,335 images in which a
variety of external forces are applied to different types of objects resulting
in more than 65,000 object movements represented in 3D. Our experimental
evaluations show that the challenging task of predicting long-term movements of
objects as their reaction to external forces is possible from a single image.

test how gravitational radiation propagates with the distance from the source.
Here, we extend this formalism to cosmological scales, i.e. the high redshift
regime, and we discuss the complications of applying this methodology to high
redshift sources. We also allow for models with compactified extra dimensions
like in the Kaluza-Klein model. Furthermore, we also consider the case of
intermediate redshifts, i.e. $0<z\lesssim1$, where we show it is possible to
find an analytical approximation for the source counts $\frac{dN}{d(S/N)}$.
This can be done in terms of cosmological parameters, such as the matter
density $\Omega_{m,0}$ of the cosmological constant model or the cosmographic
parameters for a general dark energy model. Our analysis is as general as
possible, but it depends on two important factors: a source model for the black
hole binary mergers and the GW source to galaxy bias. This methodology also
allows us to obtain the higher order corrections of the source counts in terms
of the signal-to-noise $S/N$. We then forecast the sensitivity of future
observations in constraining GW physics but also the underlying cosmology by
simulating sources distributed over a finite range of signal-to-noise with a
number of sources ranging from 10 to 500 sources as expected from future
detectors. We find that with 500 events it will be possible to provide
constraints on the matter density parameter at present $\Omega_{m,0}$ on the
order of a few percent and with the precision growing fast with the number of
events. In the case of extra dimensions we find that depending on the
degeneracies of the model, with 500 events it may be possible to provide
stringent limits on the existence of the extra dimensions if the aforementioned
degeneracies can be broken.

whose interface condition is the theoretical basis of a mathematical model of
the multiphase flow in porous medium. The conventional interface condition at
the jump interface is expressed as the continuous Darcy velocity and fluid
pressure (named CVCM ). Our study has inspected this conclusions. First, it is
revealed that the principle of mass conservation has no direct relation to the
velocity conservation, and the former is not the true foundation of the later,
because the former only reflects the kinetic characteristic of the fluid
particles at one position(the interface), but not the neighborhood of the
interface which required by the later. Then the reasonableness of CVCM is
queried from the following three aspects:(1)Using Mukat's two phase seepage
equation and the mathematical method of apagoge, we have disproved the
continuity of each fluid velocity;(2)Since the analytical solution of the
equation of Buckley-Leveret equations is acquirable, its velocity jumps at the
flood front presents an appropriate example to disprove the CVCM;(3) The
numerical simulation model gives impractical result that flood front would stop
moving if CVCM were used to calculate the velocities at the interface between
two gridcells. Subsequently, a new one, termed as Jump Velocity Condition Model
(JVCM), is deduced from Muskat's two phase seepage equations and Darcy's law
without taking account of the capillary force and compressibility of rocks and
fluids. Finally, several cases are presented. And the comparisons of the
velocity, pressure difference and the front position, which are given by JVCM,
CVCM and SPU, have shown that the result of JVCM is the closest to the exact
solution.

from the corresponding $\Lambda$ self-energy, which is constructed within a
perturbative many-body approach using some of the hyperon-nucleon interactions
of the J\""{u}lich and Nijmegen groups. Binding energies, wave functions and
disoccupation numbers of different single-particle states are obtained for
various hypernuclei from $^5_{\Lambda}$He to $^{209}_{\,\,\,\,\,\Lambda}$Pb.
The agreement between the calculated binding energies and experimental data is
qualitatively good. The small spin-orbit splitting of the $p-, d-, f-$ and
$g-$wave states is confirmed. The discrete and the continuum contributions of
the single-$\Lambda$ spectral function are computed. Their appearance is
qualitatively similar to that of the nucleons. The $Z$-factor, that measures
the importance of correlations, is also calculated. Our results show that its
value is relatively large, indicating that the $\Lambda$ hyperon is less
correlated than nucleons. This is in agreement with the results obtained by
other authors for the correlations of the $\Lambda$ in infinite nuclear matter.
The disoccupation numbers are obtained by integrating the spectral function
over the energy. Our results show that the discrete contribution to the
disoccupation number decreases when increasing the momentum of the $\Lambda$.
This indicates that, in the production reactions of hypernuclei, the $\Lambda$
hyperon is mostly formed in a quasi-free state.

C. Although the low-level functionalities of C are often useful within kernels,
they also give rise to several classes of bugs. Kernels written in higher level
languages avoid many of these potential problems, at the possible cost of
decreased performance. This research evaluates the advantages and disadvantages
of a kernel written in a higher level language. To do this, the network stack
subsystem of the kernel was implemented in Go with the Communicating Sequential
Processes (CSP) style. Go is a high-level programming language that supports
the CSP style, which recommends splitting large tasks into several smaller ones
running in independent ""threads"". Modules for the major networking protocols,
including Ethernet, ARP, IPv4, ICMP, UDP, and TCP, were implemented. In this
study, the implemented Go network stack, called GoNet, was compared to a
representative network stack written in C. The GoNet code is more readable and
generally performs better than that of its C stack counterparts. From this, it
can be concluded that Go with CSP style is a viable alternative to C for the
language of kernel implementations.

VLA observations of a sample of seven nearby debris disks at 9 mm, with 3""
resolution and $\sim5$ $\mu$Jy/beam rms. We combine these with archival ATCA
observations of eight additional debris disks observed at 7 mm, together with
up-to-date observations of all disks at (sub)millimeter wavelengths from the
literature to place tight constraints on the millimeter spectral indices and
thus grain size distributions. The analysis gives a weighted mean for the slope
of the power law grain size distribution, $n(a)\propto a^{-q}$, of $\langle q
\rangle = 3.36\pm0.02$, with a possible trend of decreasing $q$ for later
spectral type stars. We compare our results to a range of theoretical models of
collisional cascades, from the standard self-similar, steady-state size
distribution ($q=3.5$) to solutions that incorporate more realistic physics
such as alternative velocity distributions and material strengths, the
possibility of a cutoff at small dust sizes from radiation pressure, as well as
results from detailed dynamical calculations of specific disks. Such effects
can lead to size distributions consistent with the data, and plausibly the
observed scatter in spectral indices. For the AU Mic system, the VLA
observations show clear evidence of a highly variable stellar emission

of nontrivial order on either side of this transition, this critical point
cannot be described in a conventional Landau-Ginzburg-Wilson framework. Instead
it is described by a theory involving fractionalized degrees of freedom known
as the O$(4)^\ast$ model, whose spectrum is altered in a significant way by its
proximity to a topologically ordered phase. We compute the spectrum by relating
it to the spectrum of the O$(4)$ Wilson-Fisher fixed point on the torus,
modified with a selection rule on the states, and with nontrivial boundary
conditions corresponding to topological sectors in the spin liquid. The

GaLaxies and their Environments (EAGLE) project. For galaxies with stellar
masses of $M_{\ast} > 10^{10.5}$ M$_{\odot}$, $[\alpha/\mathrm{Fe}]_{\ast}$
increases with increasing galaxy stellar mass and age. These trends are in good
agreement with observations of early-type galaxies, and are consistent with a
`downsizing' galaxy formation scenario: more massive galaxies have formed the
bulk of their stars earlier and more rapidly, hence from an interstellar medium
that was mostly $\alpha$-enriched by massive stars. In the absence of feedback
from active galactic nuclei (AGN), however, $[\alpha/\mathrm{Fe}]_{\ast}$ in
$M_{\ast} > 10^{10.5}$ M$_{\odot}$ galaxies is roughly constant with stellar
mass and decreases with mean stellar age, extending the trends found for
lower-mass galaxies in both simulations with and without AGN. We conclude that
AGN feedback can account for the $\alpha$-enhancement of massive galaxies, as
it suppresses their star formation, quenching more massive galaxies at earlier
times, thereby preventing the iron from longer-lived intermediate-mass stars
(supernova Type Ia) from being incorporated into younger stars.

limits) of 11 elements. These allow us to chemically tag the star and discuss
its origin, although our derived abundances and metallicity, at [Fe/H] =-0.9

we cannot exclude that it originated in the bulge. However, combining its
retrograde orbit and the derived abundances suggests that the star was
accelerated from the outskirts of the inner (or even outer) halo during
many-body interactions. Other possible origins include the bulge itself, or the

the individual systems until the coalescence of the compact remnants. We
estimate the contribution of primordial stars to the merger rate density and to
the detection rate of the Advanced Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave

stars produce strong GW signals, even if their contribution in number is
relatively small. We find a probability of $\gtrsim1\%$ that the current

roughly 1 primordial BH-BH merger per year for the final design sensitivity,

electrons in a half-filled Landau level, starting from the traditional approach
pioneered by Halperin, Lee and Read. Specifically, we study a system consisting
of alternating quasi-one-dimensional strips of composite Fermi liquid (CFL) and
composite hole liquid (CHL), both of which break particle-hole symmetry. When
the CFL and CHL strips are identical in size, the resulting state is manifestly
invariant under the combined action of a particle-hole transformation with
respect to a single Landau level (which interchanges the CFL and CHL) and
translation by one unit, equal to the strip width, in the direction transverse
to the strips. At distances long compared to the strip width, we demonstrate
that the system is described by a Dirac fermion coupled to an emergent gauge
field, with an anti-unitary particle-hole symmetry, as recently proposed by
Son.

Based on fits to idealized analytic models, we find the progenitor radius of
KSN2011a (280$\pm 20$ R$_\odot$) to be significantly smaller than that for
KSN2011d (490$\pm 20$ R$_\odot$) but both have similar explosion energies of
2.0$\pm 0.3\times 10^{51}$ erg.
  The rising light curve of KSN2011d is an excellent match to that predicted by
simple models of exploding red supergiants (RSG). However, the early rise of
KSN2011a is faster than the models predict possibly due to the supernova
shockwave moving into pre-existing wind or mass-loss from the RSG. A mass loss
rate of $10^{-4}$ M$_\odot$ yr$^{-1}$ from the RSG can explain the fast rise
without impacting the optical flux at maximum light or the shape of the
post-maximum light curve.
  No shock breakout emission is seen in KSN2011a, but this is likely due to the
circumstellar interaction suspected in the fast rising light curve. The early
light curve of KSN2011d does show excess emission consistent with model
predictions of a shock breakout. This is the first optical detection of a shock
breakout from a type II-P supernova.

simulations, we find that a substantial amount of subcritical material fed to
the accretion disk, lingers around long enough to contribute significantly to
the energy loss rate. Increasing the amount of angular momentum in the
subcritical material increases the time spent at the accretion disk, and only
when the bulk of this subcritical material is accreted before it is replenished
by a massive outermost supercritical shell, the inner engine experiences a
shutdown. Once the muffled accretion disk is provided again with enough
supercritical material, the shutdown will be over and a quiescent time in the

theoretical framework of modelling the Galaxy based on population synthesis
modeling and the use of asteroseismic scaling relations for giants. We use the
open source code Galaxia to model the Milky Way and find the distribution of
the masses predicted by Galaxia to be systematically offset with respect to the
seismically-inferred observed masses. The Galactic model overestimates the
number of low mass stars, and these stars are predominantly old and of low
metallicity. Using corrections to the $\Delta \nu$ scaling relation suggested
by stellar models (available for download) significantly reduces the
disagreement between predicted and observed masses. For a few cases where
non-seismic mass estimates are available, the corrections to $\Delta \nu$ also
improve the agreement between seismic and non-seismic mass estimates. The
disagreement between predictions of the Galactic model and the observations is
most pronounced for stars with ${\rm [Fe/H]}<-0.5$ and ${\rm [Fe/H]}>0$ or for
$T_{\rm eff}>4700$ K. Altering the star formation rate in order to suppress
stars older than 10 Gyr improves the agreement for mass but leads to
inconsistent color distributions. We also tested the predictions of the
TRILEGAL Galactic model. However, unlike {\sl Galaxia}, it had difficulties in
reproducing the photometric properties of the Kepler Input Catalog because it
overestimates the number of blue stars. We conclude that either the scaling
relations and/or the Galactic models need to be revised to reconcile
predictions of theory with asteroseismic observations.

see within a surveyed population of interest are often unrepresentative of the
truth we seek. Transiting planets currently represent the most informative data
set on the ensemble properties of exoplanets within 1 AU of their star.
However, the transit method is inherently biased due to both geometric and
detection-driven effects. In this work, we derive the overall observational
biases affecting the most basic transit parameters from first principles. By
assuming a trapezoidal transit and using conditional probability, we infer the
expected distribution of these terms both as a joint distribution and in a
marginalized form. These general analytic results provide a baseline against
which to compare trends predicted by mission-tailored injection/recovery
simulations and offer a simple way to correct for observational bias. Our
results explain why the observed population of transiting planets displays a
non-uniform impact parameter distribution, with a bias towards near-equatorial
geometries. We also find that the geometric bias towards observed planets
transiting near periastron is attenuated by the longer durations which occur
near apoastron. Finally, we predict that the observational bias with respect to
ratio-of-radii is super-quadratic, scaling as $(R_P/R_{\star})^{5/2}$, driven
by an enhanced geometric transit probability and modestly longer durations.

OGLE-2014-BLG-1760, which shows a strong light curve signal due to the presence
of a Jupiter mass-ratio planet. One unusual feature of this event is that the
source star is quite blue, with $V-I = 1.48\pm 0.08$. This is marginally
consistent with source star in the Galactic bulge, but it could possibly
indicate a young source star in the far side of the disk. Assuming a bulge
source, we perform a Bayesian analysis assuming a standard Galactic model, and
this indicates that the planetary system resides in or near the Galactic bulge
at $D_L = 6.9 \pm 1.1 $ kpc. It also indicates a host star mass of $M_* = 0.51
\pm 0.44 M_\odot$, a planet mass of $m_p = 180 \pm 110 M_\oplus$, and a
projected star-planet separation of $a_\perp = 1.7\pm 0.3\,$AU. The lens-source
relative proper motion is $\mu_{\rm rel} = 6.5\pm 1.1$ mas/yr. The lens (and
stellar host star) is predicted to be very faint, so it is most likely that it
can detected only when the lens and source stars are partially resolved. Due to
the relatively high relative proper motion, the lens and source will be
resolved to about $\sim46\,$mas in 6-8 years after the peak magnification. So,
by 2020 - 2022, we can hope to detect the lens star with deep, high resolution
images.

(QCQP), which is further tackled by the semidefinite relaxation (SDR)
technique. We analyze the approximation quality of two-variable fractional SDRs
under the Gaussian randomization algorithm. These results are fundamentally new
and reveal that the proposed BFA AF scheme can outperform the traditional BF AF
scheme, especially when there are many users in the system or many generalized
power constraints in the problem formulation. From a practical perspective, the
BFA AF scheme offers two degrees of freedom (DoFs) in beamformer design, as
opposed to the one DoF offered by the BF AF scheme, to improve the receivers'
SINR. In the latter part of this paper, we demonstrate how this extra DoF leads
to provable performance gains by considering two special cases of multicasting,
where the AF process is shown to employ a special structure. The numerical
simulations further validate that the proposed BFA AF scheme outperforms the BF
AF scheme and works well for large-scale relay systems.

gauge mediation picture. While the fermion messengers lie in the (10-100) TeV
range, some scalar messengers are significantly lighter and are responsible for
the sgoldstino production and decay. Their effective coupling to the sgoldstino
is correspondingly enhanced, and a non-perturbative regime is triggered when
light and heavy messenger masses differ by a factor $\sim4\pi$. We also comment
on the possible role of an R-axion and on the possibility to decouple the

the Atacama Large Millimetre/submillimeter Array (ALMA) at 3 mm continuum
emission, at a resolution of $\sim$3"" (1 200 AU). We identify from the region
43 dense cores with masses about a solar mass. 60% of the ALMA cores are
protostellar and 40\% are starless. The nearest neighbour separations of the
cores do not show a preferred fragmentation scale; the frequency of short
separations increases down to 1 200 AU. We apply a two-point correlation
analysis on the dense core separations and show that the ALMA cores are
significantly grouped at separations below $\sim$17 000 AU and strongly grouped
below $\sim$6 000 AU. The protostellar and starless cores are grouped
differently: only the starless cores group strongly below $\sim$6 000 AU. In
addition, the spatial distribution of the cores indicates periodic grouping of
the cores into groups of $\sim$30 000 AU in size, separated by $\sim$50 000 AU.
The groups coincide with dust column density peaks detected by Herschel. These
results show hierarchical, two-mode fragmentation in which the maternal
filament periodically fragments into groups of dense cores. Critically, our
results indicate that the fragmentation models for lower line-mass filaments

ISF. We also find that the protostars identified with Spitzer and Herschel in
the ISF are grouped at separations below $\sim$17 000 AU. In contrast, young
stars with disks do not show significant grouping. This suggests that the
grouping of dense cores is partially retained over the protostar lifetime, but
not over the lifetime of stars with disks.

galaxies used to derive the mass of galaxy clusters by weak lensing.
  The method is based on the simultaneous analysis of the shear signal, that
should be consistent with zero for the foreground, unlensed galaxies, and of
the colors of the galaxies: photometric data from the COSMic evOlution Survey
are used to train the color selection. In order to validate this methodology,
we test it against a set of state-of-the-art image simulations of mock galaxy
clusters in different redshift [$0.23-0.45$] and mass
[$0.5-1.55\times10^{15}M_\odot$] ranges, mimicking medium-deep multicolor
imaging observations (e.g. SUBARU, LBT).
  The performance of our method in terms of contamination by unlensed sources
is comparable to a selection based on photometric redshifts, which however
requires a good spectral coverage and is thus much more observationally
demanding. The application of our method to simulations gives an average ratio
between estimated and true masses of $\sim 0.98 \pm 0.09$. As a further test,
we finally apply our method to real data, and compare our results with other
weak lensing mass estimates in the literature: for this purpose we choose the

an unknown component is very difficult when no particular assumption is made on
the structure of the unknown component. A symmetry assumption was used in the
literature to simplify the estimation. Such method has the advantage of
producing consistent and asymptotically normal estimators, and identifiability
of the semiparametric mixture model becomes tractable. Still, existing methods
which estimate a semiparametric mixture model have their limits when the
parametric component has unknown parameters or the proportion of the parametric
part is either very high or very low. We propose in this paper a method to
incorporate a prior linear information about the distribution of the unknown
component in order to better estimate the model when existing estimation
methods fail. The new method is based on $\varphi-$divergences and has an
original form since the minimization is carried over both arguments of the
divergence. The resulting estimators are proved to be consistent and
asymptotically normal under standard assumptions. We show that using the
Pearson's $\chi^2$ divergence our algorithm has a linear complexity when the

observed in (ultra) luminous infrared galaxies and serve as markers of major
galaxy mergers. In blind emission line surveys such as the Arecibo Legacy Fast
Arecibo L-Band Feed Array (ALFALFA) survey for neutral hydrogen (HI), OHMs at
z~0.2 can mimic z~0.05 HI lines. We present the results of optical spectroscopy
of ambiguous HI detections in the ALFALFA 40% data release detected by the Wide
Field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE) but with uncertain optical counterparts.
The optical redshifts, obtained from observations at the Apache Point
Observatory, revealed five new OHMs and identified 129 HI optical counterparts.
Sixty candidates remain ambiguous. The new OHMs are the first detected in a
blind spectral line survey.
  The number of OHMs in ALFALFA is consistent with predictions from the OH
luminosity function. Additionally, the mid-infrared magnitudes and colors of
the OHM host galaxies found in a blind survey do not seem to differ from those
found in previous targeted surveys. This validates the methods used in previous
IR-selected OHM surveys and indicates there is no previously unknown
OHM-producing population at z~0.2. We also provide a method for future surveys
to separate OH megamasers from 99% of HI line emitters without optical
spectroscopy by using WISE infrared colors and magnitudes. Since the fraction
of OHMs found in flux-limited HI surveys is expected to increase with the
survey's redshift, this selection method can be applied to future flux-limited
high-redshift hydrogen surveys.

propose a content caching and distribution framework for smart grid enabled
OFDM networks, where each popular multimedia file is coded and distributively
stored in multiple energy harvesting enabled serving nodes (SNs), and the green
energy distributively harvested by SNs can be shared with each other through
the smart grid. The distributive caching, green energy sharing and the on-grid
energy backup have improved the reliability and performance of the wireless
multimedia downloading process. To minimize the total on-grid power consumption
of the whole network, while guaranteeing that each user can retrieve the whole
content, the user association scheme is jointly designed with consideration of
resource allocation, including subchannel assignment, power allocation and
power flow among nodes, where the user association scheme decides which SN
serves which user. First, the optimal power allocated to each subchannel and
the power flows among nodes are derived analytically. Then, the user
association problem is decoupled from the subchannel assignment problem, and
the proposed user association scheme has leveraged the multicasting nature of
the content download process. To decide which subchannel is assigned to which
node, the number of subchannels assigned to each node is first determined,
according to the green energy generating rate and the associated traffic
offload, and then the corresponding subchannels are selected from the total
assigned system spectrum. Simulation results demonstrate that bringing content,
green energy and serving node closer to the end user can notably reduce the
on-grid energy consumption.

study the mor- phology and kinetic pathway in spontaneous formation and growth
of droplets of the stable phase in the metastable background. The parameter
$\kappa$ that quantifies the anisotropic elastic energy plays a central role in
determining the geometric structure of the droplets. Noncircular nematic
droplets with homogeneous director orientation are nucleated in a background of
supercooled isotropic phase for small $\kappa$. For large $\kappa$, noncircular
droplets with integer topological charge, accompanied by a biaxial ring at the
outer surface, are nucleated. The isotropic droplet shape in a superheated
nematic background is found to depend on $\kappa$ in a similar way. Identical
growth laws are found in the two cases, although an unusual two-stage mechanism
is observed in the nucleation of isotropic droplets. Temporal distributions of
successive events indicate the relevance of long-ranged elasticity-mediated
interactions within the isotropic domains. Implications for a theoretical
description of nucleation in anisotropic fluids are discussed.

orbit of Planet Nine, the recently proposed perturber in a distant eccentric
orbit in the outer solar system. We compare our simulations to the observed
population of aligned eccentric high semimajor axis Kuiper belt objects and
determine which simulation parameters are statistically compatible with the
observations. We find that only a narrow range of orbital elements can
reproduce the observations. In particular, the combination of semimajor axis,
eccentricity, and mass of Planet Nine strongly dictates the semimajor axis
range of the orbital confinement of the distant eccentric Kuiper belt objects.
Allowed orbits, which confine Kuiper belt objects with semimajor axis beyond
380~AU, have perihelia roughly between 150 and 350~AU, semimajor axes between
380 and 980~AU, and masses between 5 and 20 Earth masses. Orbitally confined
objects also generally have orbital planes similar to that of the planet,
suggesting that the planet is inclined approximately 30~degrees to the
ecliptic. We compare the allowed orbital positions and estimated brightness of
Planet Nine to previous and ongoing surveys which would be sensitive to the
planet's detection and use these surveys to rule out approximately two-thirds
of the planet's orbit. Planet Nine is likely near aphelion with an approximate
brightness of $22<V<25$. At opposition, its motion, mainly due to parallax, can
easily be detected within 24 hours.

that the surfaces that minimize the corresponding HEE functional for

  We further study the problem of estimating the size of a minimum set cover

factor of $\alpha$ saving in the space is achievable in this case and that this

training energy-based models including Restricted Boltzmann Machines and played
a key role in the emergence of deep learning. The idea of this algorithm is to
approximate the intractable term in the exact gradient of the log-likelihood
function by using short Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) runs. The approximate
gradient is computationally-cheap but biased. Whether and why the CD algorithm
provides an asymptotically consistent estimate are still open questions. This
paper studies the asymptotic properties of the CD algorithm in canonical
exponential families, which are special cases of the energy-based model.
Suppose the CD algorithm runs $m$ MCMC transition steps at each iteration $t$
and iteratively generates a sequence of parameter estimates $\{\theta_t\}_{t
\ge 0}$ given an i.i.d. data sample $\{X_i\}_{i=1}^n \sim p_{\theta_\star}$.
Under conditions which are commonly obeyed by the CD algorithm in practice, we
prove the existence of some bounded $m$ such that any limit point of the time
average $\left. \sum_{s=0}^{t-1} \theta_s \right/ t$ as $t \to \infty$ is a
consistent estimate for the true parameter $\theta_\star$. Our proof is based
on the fact that $\{\theta_t\}_{t \ge 0}$ is a homogenous Markov chain
conditional on the data sample $\{X_i\}_{i=1}^n$. This chain meets the
Foster-Lyapunov drift criterion and converges to a random walk around the
Maximum Likelihood Estimate. The range of the random walk shrinks to zero at
rate $\mathcal{O}(1/\sqrt[3]{n})$ as the sample size $n \to \infty$.

instability of two-dimensional force-free system of magnetic flux tubes; (iii)
we consider merger of two zero total poloidal current magnetic flux tubes. In
all cases regimes of spontaneous and driven evolution are investigated. We
identify two stages of particle acceleration: (i) fast explosive prompt X-point
collapse and (ii) ensuing island merger. The fastest acceleration occurs during
the initial catastrophic X-point collapse, with the reconnection electric field
of the order of the magnetic field. The explosive stage of reconnection
produces non-thermal power-law tails with slopes that depend on the average
magnetization. The X-point collapse stage is followed by magnetic island merger
that dissipates a large fraction of the initial magnetic energy in a regime of
forced reconnection, further accelerating the particles, but proceeds at a
slower reconnection rate. Crab flares result from the initial explosive stages
of magnetic island mergers of magnetic flux tubes produced in the bulk of
nebula at intermediate polar regions. The post-termination shock plasma flow in
the wind sectors with mild magnetization naturally generates large-scale highly
magnetized structures. Internal kink-like instabilities lead to the formation
of macroscopic current-carrying magnetic flux tubes that merge explosively.

diffusion, we develop a self-consistent model for the bright ribbon --- the
most prominent feature in Io's plasma torus. The model parameters are well
constrained by earlier {\it in situ} observations with the Galileo and Voyager
spacescrafts. Our model calculation indicates that the total power dissipated
inside the torus is 3.6 times bigger than the total power transported to Jovian
ionosphere via Birkeland current. The power dissipation inside the torus is
relatively uniform. Most of the power transportation associated with the
Birkeland current, however, is localized near the flux tube of Io. With a
height-intergrated conductivity of 0.15$\,$mho in Jovian ionosphere, consistent
with earlier aeronomy models, the model gives a reasonable fit to the recent
observations of the FUV Io tail on Jupiter. Extra mass loading near Io is
required in the model. This excess of mass injection into the plasma torus may
explain the Io-correlated energy source revealed by earlier EUV observations
with the Voyager spacecrafts. Further investigation of the model implications

forces, torques and stresslets on the colloids and flow, pressure and entropy

long-ranged, many-body character that can cause phase separation,
crystallization, synchronization and a variety of other effects observed in
active suspensions. We use the results above to derive the Langevin and
Smoluchowski equations for Brownian active suspensions, to compute active

channels. At the same time, existing algorithms for general input alphabets are
less practical because of high complexity. We address the construction problem
for the general case, and analyze an algorithm that is based on successive
reduction of the output alphabet size of the subchannels in each recursion
step. For this procedure we estimate the approximation error as
$O(\mu^{-1/(q-1)}),$ where $\mu$ is the ""quantization parameter,"" i.e., the
maximum size of the subchannel output alphabet allowed by the algorithm. The
complexity of the code construction scales as $O(N\mu^4),$ where $N$ is the
length of the code.
  We also show that if the polarizing operation relies on modulo-$q$ addition,
it is possible to merge subsets of output symbols without any loss in
subchannel capacity. Performing this procedure before each approximation step
results in a further speed-up of the code construction, and the resulting codes
have smaller gap to capacity. We show that a similar acceleration can be
attained for polar codes over finite field alphabets.
  Experimentation shows that the suggested construction algorithms can be used
to construct long polar codes for alphabets of size $q=16$ and more with
acceptable loss of the code rate for a variety of polarizing transforms.

The point spectrum is computed via an Evans function using the compound matrix
method, whereby we find that it has no roots with positive real part. Moreover,
the essential spectrum lies strictly in the left half plane. Thus, we find that
the travelling wave solution found by Chan & Kim (2013) corresponding to

energy costs in data centers by modulating energy consumption. Towards this
end, data centers can employ a rich set of resource management knobs, such as
workload shifting and dynamic server provisioning. Nonetheless, these knobs may
not be readily available in a cloud data center (CDC) that serves cloud
tenants/users, because workloads in CDCs are managed by tenants themselves who
are typically charged based on a usage-based or flat-rate pricing and often
have no incentive to cooperate with the CDC operator for demand response and
cost saving. Towards breaking such ""split incentive"" hurdle, a few recent
studies have tried market-based mechanisms, such as dynamic pricing, inside
CDCs. However, such mechanisms often rely on complex designs that are hard to
implement and difficult to cope with by tenants. To address this limitation, we
propose a novel incentive mechanism that is not dynamic, i.e., it keeps pricing
for cloud resources unchanged for a long period. While it charges tenants based
on a Usage-based Pricing (UP) as used by today's major cloud operators, it
rewards tenants proportionally based on the time length that tenants set as
deadlines for completing their workloads. This new mechanism is called
Usage-based Pricing with Monetary Reward (UPMR). We demonstrate the
effectiveness of UPMR both analytically and empirically. We show that UPMR can
reduce the CDC operator's energy cost by 12.9% while increasing its profit by
4.9%, compared to the state-of-the-art approaches used by today's CDC operators
to charge their tenants.

modern genomic research, a process by which p-values are attached to a test
statistic by randomly permuting the sample or gene labels. Yet permutation
p-values published in the genomic literature are often computed incorrectly,
understated by about 1/m, where m is the number of permutations. The same is
often true in the more general situation when Monte Carlo simulation is used to
assign p-values. Although the p-value understatement is usually small in
absolute terms, the implications can be serious in a multiple testing context.
The understatement arises from the intuitive but mistaken idea of using
permutation to estimate the tail probability of the test statistic. We argue
instead that permutation should be viewed as generating an exact discrete null
distribution. The relevant literature, some of which is likely to have been
relatively inaccessible to the genomic community, is reviewed and summarized. A
computation strategy is developed for exact p-values when permutations are
randomly drawn. The strategy is valid for any number of permutations and
samples. Some simple recommendations are made for the implementation of
permutation tests in practice.

both the apparent motion of the visible point as a function of pulsar phase,

spin frequency of the star, (ii) the drift frequency of the magnetospheric
plasma in the source region, and (iii) the angular frequency of the visible
point around its trajectory. We show how the last of these, which is neglected
in traditional models by implicitly assuming the line of sight through the
center of the star, affects the interpretation of $P_2$. We attribute the
subpulse structure to emission from $m$ anti-nodes distributed uniformly in
azimuthal angle about the magnetic axis. We show that variations of $P_2$ as a
function of rotational phase or observing frequency arise naturally when the
motion of the visible point is taken into account. We discuss possible

for new physics at the TeV scale. We discuss variations of the model considered
earlier, in which one or more diphoton excesses arise from composite pseudo
Nambu-Goldstone bosons (hidden pions) associated with new strong dynamics at
the TeV scale. We study the case in which the 750 GeV excess arises from a
unique hidden pion leading to a diphoton final state as well as the case in
which it arises from one of the hidden pions decaying into diphotons. We
consider SU(N), SO(N), and Sp(N) gauge groups for the strong dynamics and find
that SO(N) and Sp(N) models give extra hidden pions beyond those in the SU(N)
models, which can be used to discriminate among models.

processing or streaming applications. Since modern embedded applications become
more complex with dynamic behavior changes at run-time, several extensions of
the SDF model have been proposed to specify the dynamic behavior changes while
preserving static analyzability of the SDF model. They assume that an
application has a finite number of behaviors (or modes) and each behavior
(mode) is represented by an SDF graph. They are classified as multi-mode
dataflow models in this paper. While there exist several scheduling techniques
for multi-mode dataflow models, no one allows task migration between modes. By
observing that the resource requirement can be additionally reduced if task
migration is allowed, we propose a multiprocessor scheduling technique of a
multi-mode dataflow graph considering task migration between modes. Based on a
genetic algorithm, the proposed technique schedules all SDF graphs in all modes
simultaneously to minimize the resource requirement. To satisfy the throughput
constraint, the proposed technique calculates the actual throughput requirement
of each mode and the output buffer size for tolerating throughput jitter. We
compare the proposed technique with a method which analyzes SDF graphs in each
execution mode separately and a method that does not allow task migration for
synthetic examples and three real applications: H.264 decoder, vocoder, and LTE
receiver algorithms.

in deriving quantum uncertainty and complementarity relations, for both weak

allows the standard Heisenberg uncertainty relation to be derived from a
classical uncertainty relation for complex random variables. We show this
formula also leads to strong uncertainty relations for unitary operators, and
underlies an interpretation of weak values as optimal (complex) estimates of
quantum observables. Furthermore, we show that two incompatible observables
that are weakly and strongly measured in a weak measurement context obey a
complementarity relation under the interchange of these observables, in the
form of an upper bound on the product of the corresponding weak values.
Moreover, general tradeoff relations between weak purity, quantum purity and
quantum incompatibility, and also between weak and strong joint probability
distributions, are obtained based on products of real and imaginary components
of weak values, where these relations quantify the degree to which weak
probabilities can take anomalous values in a given context.

the proposed method learns hash functions that generates unified hash codes

  arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with arXiv:1305.0186",,"10.3847/0004-637X/827/2/139",,"astro-ph.GA","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We find that significant incompleteness in stellar number counts results in a
significant overestimate of the microlensing optical depth $\tau$ and event
rate per star per year $\Gamma$ toward the Galactic bulge from the first two
years of the MOA-II survey. We find that the completeness in Red Clump Giant
(RCG) counts $f_{\rm RC}$ decreases proportional to the galactic latitude $b$,
as $f_{\rm RC}=(0.63\pm0.11)-(0.052\pm0.028)\times b$, ranging between 1 and
0.7 at $b=-6^\circ\sim-1.5^\circ$. The previous measurements using all sources
by Difference Image Analysis (DIA) by MACHO and MOA-I suffer the same bias. On
the other hand, the measurements using a RCG sample by OGLE-II, MACHO and EROS
were free from this bias because they selected only the events associated with
the resolved stars. Thus, the incompleteness both in the number of events and
stellar number count cancel out. We estimate $\tau$ and $\Gamma$ by correcting
this incompleteness. In the central fields with $|l|<5^\circ$, we find
$\Gamma=[18.74\pm0.91]\times10^{-6}\exp[(0.53\pm0.05)(3-|b|)]$ star$^{-1}$
yr$^{-1}$ and $\tau_{200}=[1.84\pm0.14]\times10^{-6}\exp[(0.44\pm0.07)(3-|b|)]$
for the 427 events with $t_{\rm E}\leq200\,$days using all sources brighter
than $I_s\leq20$ mag. Our revised all-source $\tau$ measurements are about
2-$\sigma$ smaller than the other all-source measurements and are consistent
with the RCG measurements within 1-$\sigma$. We conclude that the long-standing
problem on discrepancy between the high $\tau$ with all-source samples by DIA
and low $\tau$ with RCG samples can probably be explained by the incompleteness
of the stellar number count. A model fit to these measurements predicts
$\Gamma=4.60\pm0.25\times10^{-5}$ star$^{-1}$ yr$^{-1}$ at $|b|\sim-1^\circ.4$
and $-2^\circ.25<l<3^\circ.75$ for sources with $I<20$, where the future space
mission WFIRST will observe.

interaction of the quantum system of interest with a large Markovian bath in
its ground state, such that the interaction Hamiltonian couples only
consecutive energy eigenstates of the system. We prove that the output
generated by any input state $\rho$ majorizes the output generated by the
passive input state $\rho_0$ with the same spectrum of $\rho$. Then, the output
generated by $\rho$ can be obtained applying a random unitary operation to the
output generated by $\rho_0$. This is an extension of De Palma et al., IEEE

one-mode bosonic Gaussian channels. We also prove that for finite temperature
this optimality property can fail already in a two-level system, where the best

appear to be identical to the case of a Leidenfrost drop on a solid substrate.
For large drops, in contrast, they are different and no evidence of chimney
formation has been observed either experimentally or theoretically in the range
of drop sizes considered in this study. Concerning the evaporation dynamics,
the radius is shown to decrease linearly with time whatever the drop size,
which differs from the case of a Leidenfrost drop on a solid substrate. For
high superheats, the characteristic lifetime of the drops versus the superheat

deviates from this scaling by rather saturating.

duality generalizes the FZZ correspondence, which can be thought of as an
identification between a normalizable mode of dilaton gravity and a mode of the
tachyon with winding number one around the Euclidean time circle. It implies
that normalizable states on a large Euclidean black hole have support at widely
separated scales. In particular, localized states that are extended over the
cap of the cigar (the Euclidian analog of the black hole atmosphere) have a
component that is localized near the tip of the cigar (the analog of the
stretched horizon). As a consequence of this duality, the states exhibit a
transition as a function of radial excitation level. From the perspective of a
low energy probe, low lying states are naturally thought of as oscillator
states in the black hole atmosphere, while at large excitation level they are
naturally described as wound strings. As the excitation level increases, the
size of the states first decreases and then increases. This behavior is
expected to be a general feature of black hole horizons in string theory.

scale-free networks and so pre-supposes attachment mechanisms which may not
exist in nature. We present a coevolutionary model of public goods games in
networks, growing by random attachment, from small founding populations of
simple agents. The model demonstrates the emergence of cooperation in
moderately heterogeneous networks, regardless of original founders' behaviour,
and absent higher cognitive abilities such as recognition or memory. It may
thus illustrate a more general mechanism for the evolution of cooperation, from
early origins, in minimally cognitive organisms. It is the first example of a
model explaining cooperation in public goods games on growing networks.

forty-years-old proposal of a string-junction as a necessary complement to the
conventional classification of hadrons based just on their quark-antiquark
constituents. In that proposal single (though in general metastable) hadronic
states are associated with ""irreducible"" gauge-invariant operators consisting
of Wilson lines (visualized as strings of color flux tubes) that may either end
on a quark or an antiquark, or annihilate in triplets at a junction $J$ or an
anti-junction $\bar{J}$. For the junction-free sector (ordinary $q\, \bar{q}$
mesons and glueballs) the picture is supported by large-$N$ (number of colors)
considerations as well as by a lattice strong-coupling expansion. Both imply
the famous OZI rule suppressing quark-antiquark annihilation diagrams. For
hadrons with $J$ and/or $\bar{J}$ constituents the same expansions support our
proposal, including its generalization of the OZI rule to the suppression of
$J-\bar{J}$ annihilation diagrams. Such a rule implies that hadrons with
junctions are ""mesophobic"" and thus unusually narrow if they are below
threshold for decaying into as many baryons as their total number of junctions
(two for a tetraquark, three for a pentaquark). Experimental support for our
claim, based on the observation that narrow multiquark states typically lie
below (well above) the relevant baryonic (mesonic) thresholds, will be
presented.

the resolution of excess, it is found that the signal strength of diphoton
Higgs decay can have a $10\%$ deviation from the SM prediction and that the
upper limits of the branching ratios for rare top-quark decays are $BR(t\to c
(h, Z)) < (6.8, 0.48) \times 10^{-5}$. We find that the production cross
section of a single VLQ by electroweak processes is larger than that of
VLQ-pair by QCD processes. To explore the signals of the heavy VLQs at the LHC,
we throughly analyze the production of single $X_{\pm 5/3}$ and $Y_{\mp 4/3}$
via $q_i q'_j$ annihilations in $pp$ collisions at $\sqrt{s}=13$ TeV. It is
found that the electroweak production cross sections for $d X_{5/3}$, $u
Y_{-4/3} $, and $d Y_{4/3} $ channels with $m_X=m_Y=1$ TeV can be $84.3$,
$72.3$, and $157.8$ fb, respectively; and the dominant decay modes are $X_{5/3}
\to (c,t) W^+$ and $Y_{-4/3} \to (s,b) W^-$. With adopting kinematic cuts, the
significance for $pp\to d W^+ t$ channel can be over $5\sigma$.

phase and in the comparatively brittle hard phase in the microstructure of a

macroscopic fracture initiation. The simplicity of the model ensures highly
efficient computations, enabling an comprehensive study: a large range of hard
phase volume fractions and yield stress ratios, for wide range of applied
stress states. Each combination of these parameters is analyzed using a large
set of (random) microstructures. It is observed that only one of the phases
dominates macroscopic fracture initiation: at low stress triaxiality the soft
phase is dominant, but above a critical triaxiality the hard phase takes over
resulting in a strong decrease in ductility. This transition is strongly
dependent on microstructural parameters. If the hard phase volume fraction is
small, the fracture initiation is dominated by the soft phase even at high
phase contrast. At higher hard phase volume fraction, the hard phase dominates
already at low phase contrast. This simple model thereby reconciles
experimental observations from the literature for a specific combination of
parameters, which may have triggered contradictory statements in the past. A
microscopic analysis reveals that the average phase distribution around
fracture initiation sites is nearly the same for the two failure mechanisms.
Along the tensile direction, regions of the hard phase are found directly next
to the fracture initiation site. This `band' of hard phase is intersected
through the fracture initiation site by `bands' of the soft phase aligned with
shear. Clearly, the local mechanical incompatibility is dominant for the
initiation of fracture, regardless whether fracture initiates in the soft or in
the hard phase.

Vertices may have attributes associated with them; for example, properties of
proteins in protein-protein interaction networks, users' social network
profiles, or authors' publication histories in co-authorship networks. In a
network, two vertices might be considered similar if they have similar
attributes (features, properties), or they can be considered similar based
solely on the network structure. Similarity of this type is called structural
similarity, to distinguish it from properties similarity, social similarity,
textual similarity, functional similarity or other similarity types found in
networks. Here we focus on the similarity problem by computing (1) for each
vertex a vector of structural features, called signature vector, based on the
number of graphlets associated with the vertex, and (2) for the network its
graphlet correlation matrix, measuring graphlets dependencies and hence
revealing unknown organizational principles of the network. We found that
real-world networks generally have very different structural characteristics
resulting in different graphlet correlation matrices. In particular, the
graphlet correlation matrix of the brain effective network is computed for 40
healthy subjects and common (present in more than 70 percent subjects)
dependencies are raveled. Thus, negative correlations are found for 2-node

found only for 3-node graphlets that are triangles. Graphlets characteristics

  Applications","Ph.D. thesis",,,,"hep-th","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In the present thesis I studied the phenomenology arising from a class of
string models called sequestered compactifications, which were born with the
aim of getting low-energy SUSY from strings. This is not an easy task if
combined with cosmological constraints, since the mechanism of moduli
stabilization fixes both the scale of supersymmetric particles and the scale of
moduli, which tend to be of the same order. However, if on the one hand
supersymmetric particles with TeV mass are desired in order to address the
hierarchy problem, on the other hand the cosmological moduli problem requires
the moduli to be heavier than 100 TeV. The specific setup of sequestered
compactifications makes this hierarchy achievable, at least in principle: as in
these models the visible sector is located on a stack of D3-branes at
singularities, a physical separation between the visible degrees of freedom and
the SUSY-breaking sources takes place. Such decoupling translates into a
hierarchy between the scale of SUSY-breaking and the spectrum of supersymmetric
particles. Moreover, it is interesting to notice that moduli are the
four-dimensional manifestation of the existence of extra-dimensions, and then
their presence is a common feature of all string compactifications. Since they
are gravitationally coupled, they could decay late in the history of the
universe, affecting in a significant way its cosmological evolution. Possible
deviations of the cosmological observables from the values predicted by the
standard Hot Big Bang Theory constitute an interesting alternative for the
discovery of BSM physics, which is complementary to the particle physics
search. For this reason in addition to SUSY-breaking in sequestered models, I
also studied several cosmological scenarios arising from them, such as
production of non-thermal dark matter and dark radiation, reheating from moduli
decay and inflation.

microstructure comprises grains of two or more phases. The local plastic
response is determined by (i) the relative misorientation of the slip systems
of individual grains, and (ii) the different mechanical properties of the
phases. The relative importance of these two mechanisms at the meso-scale is
unclear: is the plastic response dominated by the grain's anisotropy, or is
this effect overwhelmed by the mechanical contrast between the two phases? The
answer impacts the modeling of such a material at the meso-scale, but also
gives insights in the resulting fracture mechanisms at that length-scale. Until
now, this question has been addressed only for particular crystallographies and
mechanical properties. In contrast, this paper studies the issue systematically
using a large set of phase distributions, crystallographies, and material
parameters. It is found that the macroscopic and the mesoscopic
(grain-averaged) plastic response of the two extreme modeling choices (crystal
plasticity or isotropic plasticity) converge with increasing phase contrast.
The effect of the crystallography is completely overwhelmed by the phase
contrast when the yield stress of the hard phase is a factor of four higher
compared to the soft phase. When this ratio is lower than two, its influence
may not be neglected. However, even in this regime, fracture initiation is
controlled by the local arrangement of the phases. The latter is quantified in
this paper through the average arrangement of the phases around fracture
initiation sites.

investigate whether one can relax existing binary and ternary code design to

general elliptic problems is presented. The resulting error estimator is of
residual-type and applies on very general polygonal/polyhedral meshes. The
estimator is fully computable as it relies only on quantities available from
the VEM solution, namely its degrees of freedom and element-wise polynomial
projection. Upper and lower bounds of the error estimator with respect to the
VEM approximation error are proven. The error estimator is used to drive
adaptive mesh refinement in a number of test problems. Mesh adaptation is
particularly simple to implement since elements with consecutive co-planar
edges/faces are allowed and, therefore, locally adapted meshes do not require
any local mesh post-processing.

trajectories probe the space time in a region where the spin of the SMBH is

depends on the angular momentum and spin axis of the SMBH and study the
specific case of the star S2 in detail. The spikes has a magnitude of $\sim 29$
in the K-band and the required angular resolution is of order 15-20 $\mu$as.
The combination of these two requirements poses an extreme observational
challenge, but might be possible with interferometric observations in the
sub-mm regime. The next possible time frame for observing this effect on the
star S2 is in the late 2017 and then it repeats with the period of the star.

$C^k$, $k>n-m$. In 1957 Dubovitski\u{\i} generalized this result by proving
that almost all level sets for a $C^k$ mapping have $H^s$-negligible
intersection with its critical set, where $s=\max(n-m-k+1,0)$. Here the
critical set, or $m$-critical set is defined as $Z_{v,m} = \{ x \in R^n : {\rm
rank} \nabla v(x) < m \}$. Another generalization was obtained independently by
Dubovitski\u{\i} and Federer in 1966, namely for $C^k$ mappings $v:R^n\to R^d$
and integers $m\le d$ they proved that the set of $m$-critical values
$v(Z_{v,m})$ is $H^{b}$-negligible for $b= m-1+\frac{n-m+1}{k}$. They also
established the sharpness of these results within the $C^k$ category.
  Here we prove that Dubovitski\u{\i}'s theorem can be generalized to the case
of continuous mappings of the Sobolev-Lorentz class $W^{k}_{p,1}(R^n,R^d )$,
$p=\frac{n}k$ (this is the minimal integrability assumption that guarantees the
continuity of mappings). In this situation the mappings need not be everywhere
differentiable and in order to handle the set of nondifferentiability points,
we establish for such mappings an analog of the Luzin $N$-property with respect
to lower dimensional Hausdorff content. Finally, we formulate and prove a~${\rm
bridge\ theorem}$ that includes all the above results as particular cases. This
result is new also for smooth mappings but is presented here in the general
Sobolev context. The proofs of the results are based on our previous joint

nuclear reactions, and neuronal firings that past events facilitate the future
occurrence of events. The spread of events has been extensively studied such
that the systems exhibit catastrophic chain reactions if the interaction
represented by the ratio of reproduction exceeds unity; however, their
subthreshold states for the case of the weaker interaction are not fully
understood. Here, we report that these systems are possessed by nonstationary
cascades of event-occurrences already in the subthreshold regime. Event
cascades can be harmful in some contexts, when the peak-demand causes vaccine
shortages, heavy traffic on communication lines, frequent crimes, or large
fluctuations in nuclear reactions, but may be beneficial in other contexts,
such that spontaneous activity in neural networks may be used to generate
motion or store memory. Thus it is important to comprehend the mechanism by
which such cascades appear, and consider controlling a system to tame or
facilitate fluctuations in the event-occurrences. The critical interaction for
the emergence of cascades depends greatly on the network structure in which
individuals are connected. We demonstrate that we can predict whether cascades
may emerge in a network, given information about the interactions between
individuals. Furthermore, we develop a method of reallocating connections among
individuals so that event cascades may be either impeded or impelled in a

separation of locally moving or deforming image areas from a static or globally
moving background. It builds on the latest developments in the field of robust
principal component analysis, specifically, the recently reported practical
solutions for the long-standing problem of recovering the low-rank and sparse
parts of a large matrix made up of the sum of these two components. This
article addresses a few critical issues including: embedding global motion
parameters in the matrix decomposition model, i.e., estimation of global motion
parameters simultaneously with the foreground/background separation task,
considering matrix block-sparsity rather than generic matrix sparsity as
natural feature in video processing applications, attenuating background
ghosting effects when foreground is subtracted, and more critically providing
an extremely efficient algorithm to solve the low-rank/sparse matrix
decomposition task. The first aspect is important for background/foreground
separation in generic video sequences where the background usually obeys global
displacements originated by the camera motion in the capturing process. The
second aspect exploits the fact that in video processing applications the
sparse matrix has a very particular structure, where the non-zero matrix
entries are not randomly distributed but they build small blocks within the
sparse matrix. The next feature of the proposed approach addresses removal of
ghosting effects originated from foreground silhouettes and the lack of
information in the occluded background regions of the image. Finally, the
proposed model also tackles algorithmic complexity by introducing an extremely
efficient ""SVD-free"" technique that can be applied in most
background/foreground separation tasks for conventional video processing.

are known to have occurred. To investigate whether past protostellar activity
has left a chemical imprint in this region, we mapped it in SiO($J = 2-1$), a
shock tracer, and several other molecular lines with the Nobeyama 45 m
telescope. Our observations show the presence of a complex network of
protostellar outflows. The strongest SiO emission lies beyond a radius of $\sim
0.1$ pc with respect to the center of the clump, and is characterized by broad
($> 10$ km s$^{-1}$) lines and abundances of $\sim 1.4 \times 10^{-8}$ with
respect to H$_2$. Interestingly, SiO appears relatively depleted
($\chi_\mathrm{SiO} \sim 4 \times 10^{-9}$) within this radius, despite it
being affected by molecular outflow activity. We attribute this to fast
condensation of SiO back onto dust grains and/or rapid gas-phase destruction of
SiO, favored by the high density present in this area ($> 10^6$ cm$^{-3}$).
Finally, we identify a peripheral, narrow-line ($\sim 2$ km s$^{-1}$)
component, where SiO has an abundance of a few times 10$^{-11}$. After
considering different options, we conclude that this weak emission may be
tracing protostellar shocks from the star formation episode that preceded the
current one, which have decelerated over time and eventually resulted in SiO
being largely depleted/destroyed. Alternatively, a population of unresolved
low-mass protostars may be responsible for the narrow SiO emission.
High-angular resolution observations are necessary to distinguish between these
two possibilities and thus understand the role of SiO as a chemical tracer of
past star-formation episodes in massive protoclusters.

parameters is used. The control consists of an actuating sub-domain where a
two-dimensional body force is applied at every point within the sub-volume.
This results in a total of $2.256 \cdot 10^6$ control parameters. The final
actuation achieved a successful reduction of the cost of $79.6\%$, by altering

and the ROSINA CO/CO2 measured ratio is assumed to correspond to the bulk value
in the nucleus. We find that all considered structures of water ice are able to
reproduce the Ptolemy observation with a time difference not exceeding ~50
days, i.e. lower than ~2% on 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko's orbital period. The
suspected heterogeneity of 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko's nucleus is also found
possible only if it is constituted of crystalline ices. If the icy phase is
made of amorphous ice or clathrates, the difference between Ptolemy and
ROSINA's measurements would rather originate from the spatial variations in
illumination on the nucleus surface. An eventual new measurement of the CO/CO2
ratio at Abydos by Ptolemy could be decisive to distinguish between the three
water ice structures.

pressure profiles are calculated using a macroscopic diffusion-advection

based on the one-component macroion fluid model (OCM) accounts for the strong
influence of surface-released counterions on the renormalized colloid charge
and suspension osmotic compressibility, and for the influence of the colloidal
hydrodynamic interactions and electric double layer repulsion on the
concentration-dependent suspension viscosity $\eta$, and collective diffusion
coefficient $D_c$. A strong electro-hydrodynamic enhancement of $D_c$ and
$\eta$, and likewise of the osmotic pressure is predicted theoretically, as
compared with their values for a hard-sphere suspension. We also point to the
failure of generalized Stokes-Einstein relations describing reciprocal
relations between $D_c$ and $\eta$. According to our filtration model, $D_c$ is
of dominant influence, giving rise to an only weakly developed CP layer having
practically no effect on the permeate flux. This prediction is quantitatively
confirmed by our UF measurements of the permeate flux using an aqueous
suspension of charged silica spheres as the feed system. The experimentally
detected fouling for the largest considered transmembrane pressure values is
shown not to be due to filter cake formation by crystallization or
vitrification.

the analysis of specific frequency components of brain activity, present
peculiar architectures with unique profiles of region centrality. However, the
identification of hubs in networks built from different frequency bands
simultaneously is still a challenging problem, remaining largely unexplored.
Here we identify each frequency component with one layer of a multiplex network
and face this challenge by exploiting the recent advances in the analysis of
multiplex topologies. First, we show that each frequency band carries unique
topological information, fundamental to accurately model brain functional
networks. We then demonstrate that hubs in the multiplex network, in general
different from those ones obtained after discarding or aggregating the measured
signals as usual, provide a more accurate map of brain's most important
functional regions, allowing to distinguish between healthy and schizophrenic
populations better than conventional network approaches.

yields $n = 3$, whereas a pure gravitational wave brake yields $n = 5$.
Therefore, each of these mechanisms alone can not account for the braking index
found for PSR J1640-4631. Here we show that such a braking index can be
accounted for if the spindown model combines magnetic dipole and gravitational
wave brakes. Then, we briefly discuss the detectability of this pulsar by aLIGO
and the planned Einstein Telescope. In particular, we show that the amplitude
of the gravitational wave that comes from our model is around a factor four
lower than the amplitude modeled exclusively by gravitational wave energy loss.
Another interesting outcome of our modeling is that we are able to obtain the
ellipticity from the braking index and other pulsar parameters.

using a simple experimental arrangement and approach, localization of light in
a quasi one dimensional physical system. In the experiments, reflected and
transmitted light from a stack of glass slides of varying thickness reveals an
Ohm's Law type behavior for small thicknesses, and evolution to exponential
decay of the transmitted power for thicker slide stacks. Light absorption is
negligible in our realization of the experiment. For larger stacks of slides,
weak departure from a one dimensional behavior is also observed. The experiment
and analysis of the results, then showing many of the essential features of
wave localization, is relatively straightforward, economical, and suitable for
laboratory experiments at an undergraduate level.

provides the natural regularization for chiral-symmetric gauge field theories.
In the chiral-gauge symmetry breaking phase, as to achieve the energetically

spontaneous symmetry breaking, and other fermion masses are generated via the
explicit symmetry breaking induced by the top-quark mass, four-fermion
interactions and fermion-flavor mixing matrices. A phase transition from the
symmetry breaking phase to the chiral-gauge symmetric phase at TeV scale occurs
and the drastically fine-tuning problem can be resolved. In the infrared

qualitatively obtain the hierarchy patterns of the SM fermion Dirac masses,
Yukawa couplings and family-flavor mixing matrices with three additional
right-handed neutrinos $\nu^f_R$. Large Majorana masses and lepton-symmetry
breaking are originated by the four-fermion interactions among $\nu^f_R$ and
their left-handed conjugated fields $\nu^{fc}_R$. Light masses of gauged
