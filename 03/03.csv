  electropermeabilization",,,,,"math.AP math.NA","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Electropermeabilization is a clinical technique in cancer treatment to
locally stimulate the cell metabolism. It is based on electrical fields that
change the properties of the cell membrane. With that, cancer treatment can
reach the cell more easily. Electropermeabilization occurs only with accurate
dosage of the electrical field. For applications, a monitoring for the amount
of electropermeabilization is needed. It is a first step to image the
macroscopic electrical field during the process. Nevertheless, this is not
complete, because electropermeabilization depends on critical individual
properties of the cells such as their curvature. From the macroscopic field,
one cannot directly infer that microscopic state. In this article, we study
effective parameters in a homogenization model as the next step to monitor the
microscopic properties in clinical practice. We start from a physiological cell
model for electropermeabilization and analyze its well-posedness. For a
dynamical homogenization scheme, we prove convergence and then analyze the
effective parameters, which can be found by macroscopic imaging methods. We
demonstrate numerically the sensitivity of these effective parameters to
critical microscopic parameters governing electropermeabilization. This opens
the door to solve the inverse problem of rreconstructing these parameters.

quite some time; however, the nature of their progenitors remains somewhat
mysterious. Recent theoretical studies indicated the possibility of producing
thermonuclear detonations of carbon-oxygen white dwarfs (CO WDs) at masses less
than the Chandrasekhar mass through accretion of helium-rich matter, which
would, depending on mass accretion rate, mass, and initial temperature of the
WD, spectrally resemble either a normal SN Ia or a peculiar one. This study
aims to further resolve the state of binary systems comprised of a
sub-Chandrasekhar-mass CO WD and a helium star at the point where an
accretion-induced detonation occurs and constrains the part of the initial
parameter space where this kind of phenomenon is possible. Preexisting data
obtained through simulations of single, constantly accreting CO WDs is used as
an indicator for the behavior of new binary models in which the WD is treated
as a point mass and which include the non-degenerate partner as a fully
resolved stellar model. We parameterize the ignition of the accumulated helium
layer, changes in the WD temperature, and changes in the CO core mass depending
on the mass transfer rate. The initial conditions allowing for detonation do
not form a single contiguous area in the parameter space, whose shape is
profoundly influenced by the behavior of the donor star. Mass loss due to Nova
outbursts acts in favor of detonation. According to our criteria, about 10% of
the detonations in this study can be expected to show spectra consistent with
ordinary SNe Ia; the rest exhibit peculiar features.

on a wide range of datasets shows classification performance improvement over
the baseline hierarchy (i:e:, defined by expert), clustered hierarchy and
flattening based hierarchy modification approaches. In comparison to existing
rewiring approaches, our developed method (rewHier) is computationally
efficient, enabling it to scale to datasets with large numbers of classes,

improved classification performance for classes with few training samples in

temperature, aqueous polymer solutions first brought to a boil. The incubation
time of the polymer solution at such a high temperature is traditionally kept
to a minimum to minimize its impact on the subsequent gelation. Here we study
the effect of a prolonged heating of a 1.5\% w/w agar solution at
$T=80^{\circ}$C, well above the gelling temperature. The incubation time
$\mathcal{T}$ of the polysaccharide solution is varied from a few hours up to
five days. We show that the agar solution ages as the result of both the
hydrolysis and the intramolecular oxidation of the polysaccharides. As a
consequence, both the viscosity and the pH of the solution decrease
continuously during the incubation period. Furthermore, samples withdrew at
different incubation times are cooled down to form gels which structure and
mechanical properties are systematically determined. Cryo-microscopy and X-ray
diffraction experiments reveal that agar gels formed from solutions of
increasing incubation times, display a coarser microstructure composed of
micron-sized foils which result from the condensation of the polysaccharides
and contrast with the fibrous-like microstructure of gels prepared from a fresh
agar solution. Along with structural changes, a prolonged incubation time of
the polymer solution at $T=80^{\circ}$C leads to weaker agar gels of
significantly lower shear elastic modulus. Moreover, extensive
macro-indentation experiments coupled to direct visualization show that
increasing the incubation time of the agar solution up to a few days decreases
the yield strain of the gel, while the rupture scenario turns continuously from
brittle to ductile-like. Our study suggests that the incubation time of agar
solutions at high temperature could be used to tune the mechanical properties
of agar-based gels.

We present a slightly modified practical algorithm that estimates the time

how the performance of the algorithm depends on sample size, number of

use linguistic features such as part of speech tags or chunkings. For languages
where word boundaries are not readily identified in text, word segmentation is
a key first step to generating features for an NER system. While using word
boundary tags as features are helpful, the signals that aid in identifying
these boundaries may provide richer information for an NER system. New
state-of-the-art word segmentation systems use neural models to learn
representations for predicting word boundaries. We show that these same
representations, jointly trained with an NER system, yield significant
improvements in NER for Chinese social media. In our experiments, jointly
training NER and word segmentation with an LSTM-CRF model yields nearly 5%
absolute improvement over previously published results.

it to her data, refines it according to her analysis, and repeats. However,
fitting complex models to large data is a bottleneck in this process. Deriving
algorithms for new models can be both mathematically and computationally
challenging, which makes it difficult to efficiently cycle through the steps.
To this end, we develop automatic differentiation variational inference (ADVI).
Using our method, the scientist only provides a probabilistic model and a
dataset, nothing else. ADVI automatically derives an efficient variational
inference algorithm, freeing the scientist to refine and explore many models.
ADVI supports a broad class of models-no conjugacy assumptions are required. We
study ADVI across ten different models and apply it to a dataset with millions
of observations. ADVI is integrated into Stan, a probabilistic programming
system; it is available for immediate use.

Unfortunately, pristine PS has limited wettability and poor chemical stability

power efficiency. In this work, we demonstrate that excellent wettability and
electro-chemical properties in aqueous and organic electrolytes can be obtained

algorithms for the computation of bifurcation diagrams. Nevertheless, their
combination suffers from three significant disadvantages. The first is that
they attempt to compute only the part of the diagram that is continuously
connected to the initial data; disconnected branches are overlooked. The second
is that the subproblems required (typically determinant calculation and
nullspace construction) are expensive and hard to scale to very large
discretizations. The third is that they can miss connected branches associated
with nonsimple bifurcations, such as when an eigenvalue of even multiplicity
crosses the origin. Without expert knowledge or lucky guesses, these techniques
alone can paint an incomplete picture of the dynamics of a system.
  In this paper we propose a new algorithm for computing bifurcation diagrams,
called deflated continuation, that is capable of overcoming all three of these
disadvantages. The algorithm combines classical continuation with a deflation
technique that elegantly eliminates known branches from consideration, allowing
the discovery of disconnected branches with Newton's method. Deflated
continuation does not rely on any device for detecting bifurcations and does
not involve computing eigendecompositions; all subproblems required in deflated
continuation can be solved efficiently if a good preconditioner is available
for the underlying nonlinear problem. We prove sufficient conditions for the
convergence of Newton's method to multiple solutions from the same initial
guess, providing insight into which unknown branches will be discovered. We
illustrate the success of the method on several examples where standard
techniques fail.

structures are computed by means of the finite element method in a mixture
basis consisting of linear triangular elements inside the nanowires and
constrained Hermite triangular elements near the boundaries. The nanowires with
two crystallographic orientations, namely the [001] and [111] orientations, and
with different cross-sectional shapes are considered. For each orientation, the
nanowires of the three narrow band gap semiconductors are found to show
qualitatively similar characteristics in the band structures. However, the
nanowires oriented along the two different crystallographic directions are
found to show different characteristics in the valence bands. In particular, it
is found that all the conduction bands show simple, good parabolic dispersions
in both the [001]- and [111]-oriented nanowires, while the top valence bands
show double-maximum structures in the [001]-oriented nanowires, but
single-maximum structures in the [111]-oriented nanowires. The wave functions
and spinor distributions of the band states in these nanowires are also
calculated. It is found that significant mixtures of electron and hole states
appear in the bands of these narrow band gap semiconductor nanowires. The wave
functions exhibit very different distribution patterns in the nanowires

due to radiative losses, for a realistic cluster size it is likely that
subsequent SNe go off within the hot/dilute bubble and sustain the shock till
the cluster lifetime. For realistic cluster sizes, we find that the bubble
remains overpressured only if, for a given $n_{g0}$, $N_{\rm OB}$ is
sufficiently large. While most of the input energy is still lost radiatively,
superbubbles can retain up to $\sim 5-10\%$ of the input energy in form of
kinetic+thermal energy till 10 Myr for ISM density $n_{g0} \approx 1$
cm$^{-3}$. We find that the mechanical efficiency decreases for higher
densities ($\eta_{\rm mech} \propto n_{g0}^{-2/3}$). We compare the radii and
velocities of simulated supershells with observations and the classical
adiabatic model. Our simulations show that the superbubbles retain only
$\lesssim 10\%$ of the injected energy, thereby explaining the observed smaller
size and slower expansion of supershells. We also confirm that a sufficiently
large ($\gtrsim 10^4$) number of SNe is required to go off in order to create a
steady wind with a stable termination shock within the superbubble. We show
that the mechanical efficiency increases with increasing resolution, and that
explicit diffusion is required to obtain converged results.

collisions. After the initial dispersions of the parent bodies fragments, their
orbits evolve because of several gravitational and non-gravitational
effects,such as diffusion in mean-motion resonances, Yarkovsky and YORP
effects, close encounters of collisions, etc. The subsequent dynamical
evolution of asteroid family members may cause some of the original fragments
to travel beyond the conventional limits of the asteroid family. Eventually,
the whole family will dynamically disperse and no longer be recognizable.
  A natural question that may arise concerns the timescales for dispersion of
large families. In particular, what is the oldest still recognizable family in
the main belt? Are there any families that may date from the late stages of the
Late Heavy Bombardment and that could provide clues on our understanding of the
primitive Solar System? In this work, we investigate the dynamical stability of
seven of the allegedly oldest families in the asteroid main belt. Our results
show that none of the seven studied families has a nominally mean estimated age
older than 2.7 Gyr, assuming standard values for the parameters describing the
strength of the Yarkovsky force. Most ""paleo-families"" that formed between 2.7
and 3.8 Gyr would be characterized by a very shallow size-frequency
distribution, and could be recognizable only if located in a dynamically less
active region (such as that of the Koronis family). V-type asteroids in the
central main belt could be compatible with a formation from a paleo-Eunomia
family.

SMBHs, such as those seen in local galaxies including the Milky Way's, and
active ones, resulting in quasars and active galactic nuclei (AGN). Outside our
neighbourhood, all the information we have on SMBHs is derived from quasars and
AGN, giving us a partial view. We study the evolution of the SMBH population,
total and active, by the continuity equation, backwards in time from z=0 to
z=4. Type-1 and type-2 AGN are differentiated in the model on the basis of the
Eddington ratio distribution, chosen on the basis of observational estimates.
The duty cycle is obtained by matching the luminosity function of quasars, and
the average radiative efficiency is the only free parameter in the model. For
higher radiative efficiencies (>~0.07) a large fraction of the SMBH population,
most of them quiescent, must already be in place by z=4. For lower radiative
efficiencies (~0.05), the duty cycle increases with the redshift and the SMBH
population evolves dramatically since z=4. The mass function of active SMBHs
does not depend on the choice of the radiative efficiency or of the local SMBH
mass function, but it is mainly determined by the quasar luminosity function,
once the Eddington ratio distribution is fixed. Only a direct measurement of
the total BHMF at redshifts z>~2 could break these degeneracies giving
important constraints on the average radiative efficiency. Focusing on type-1
AGN, for which observational estimates of the mass function and Eddington ratio
distribution exist at various redshift, models with lower radiative
efficiencies reproduce better the high-mass end of the mass function at high-z,
but they tend to over-predict it at low-z, and vice-versa for models with
higher radiative efficiencies.

enabling a study of finite volume and discretisation effects for $m_\pi\gtrsim
260$ MeV. Systematics are found to be reasonably under control. For the nucleon
we obtain $\sigma_{\pi N}=35(6)$ MeV and $\sigma_s=35(12)$ MeV, or equivalently
in terms of the quark fractions, $f_{T_u}=0.021(4)$, $f_{T_d}=0.016(4)$ and
$f_{T_s}=0.037(13)$, where the errors include estimates of both the systematic
and statistical uncertainties. These values, together with perturbative
matching in the heavy quark limit, lead to $f_{T_c}=0.075(4)$,
$f_{T_b}=0.072(2)$ and $f_{T_t}=0.070(1)$. In addition, through the use of the
(inverse) Feynman-Hellmann theorem our results for $\sigma_{\pi N}$ are shown
to be consistent with the nucleon masses determined in the analysis. For the
pion we implement a method which greatly reduces excited state contamination to
the scalar matrix elements from states travelling across the temporal boundary.
This enables us to demonstrate the Gell-Mann-Oakes-Renner expectation
$\sigma_\pi=m_\pi/2$ over our range of pion masses.

compute the quark condensate and compare it to lattice QCD (LQCD) results to
extract the behavior of G and M as functions of the magnetic field strength and

found to monotonically increase with the field strength, M also increases
whereas G remains approximately constant. However, for temperatures above the
chiral/deconfinement phase transitions, where the LQCD condensate is found to
monotonically decrease with increasing field, M and G also decrease
monotonically. For finite temperatures, below the transition temperature, we
find that both G and M initially grow and then decrease with increasing field
strength. To study possible consequences of the extracted temperature and
magnetic field dependence of G and M, we compute the pressure and compare to
LQCD results, finding an excellent qualitative agreement. In particular, we
show that the transverse pressure, as a function of the field strength, is
always negative for temperatures below the transition temperature whereas it
starts off being positive and then becomes negative for temperatures above the
transition temperature, also in agreement with LQCD results. We also show that
for the longitudinal pressure to agree with LQCD calculations, the system
should be described as a diamagnet. We argue that the turnover of M and G as

These changes are thought to result from the field-dependent tuning---via

melt-grown crystals, which can exhibit twin domains due to a Jahn-Teller

investigating it. We propose terminology to clarify the distinction between
'tipping points' in the popular sense, the critical thresholds exhibited by

associated with tipping elements, gradual climate change, or non-climatic

applicant has a subset of acceptable courses that she ranks in strict order of

number of courses and applicants they can be assigned to, respectively. We thus
essentially have a many-to-many bipartite matching problem with one-sided
preferences, which has applications to the assignment of students to optional
courses at a university. We consider additive preferences and lexicographic
preferences as two means of extending preferences over individual courses to
preferences over bundles of courses. We additionally focus on the cases that
courses have prerequisite constraints and where courses may be corequisites.
  For these extensions to the basic problem, we present the following
algorithmic results, which are mainly concerned with the computation of Pareto
optimal matchings (POMs). Firstly, we consider compulsory prerequisites. For
additive preferences, we show that the problem of finding a POM is NP-hard. On
the other hand, in the case of lexicographic preferences we give a
polynomial-time algorithm for finding a POM, based on the well-known sequential
mechanism. However we show that the problem of deciding whether a given
matching is Pareto optimal is co-NP-complete. We further prove that finding a
maximum cardinality (Pareto optimal) matching is NP-hard. Under alternative
prerequisites, we show that finding a POM is NP-hard for either additive or
lexicographic preferences. Finally we consider corequisites. We prove that, as
in the case of compulsory prerequisites, finding a POM is NP-hard for additive
preferences, though solvable in polynomial time for lexicographic preferences.
In the latter case, the problem of finding a maximum cardinality POM is NP-hard
and very difficult to approximate

video streaming over the Internet. It allows clients to dynamically adapt media
characteristics to network conditions in order to ensure a high quality of
experience, that is, minimize playback interruptions, while maximizing video
quality at a reasonable level of quality changes. In the case of live
streaming, this task becomes particularly challenging due to the latency
constraints. The challenge further increases if a client uses a wireless
network, where the throughput is subject to considerable fluctuations.
Consequently, live streams often exhibit latencies of up to 30 seconds. In the
present work, we introduce an adaptation algorithm for HTTP-based live
streaming called LOLYPOP (Low-Latency Prediction-Based Adaptation) that is
designed to operate with a transport latency of few seconds. To reach this
goal, LOLYPOP leverages TCP throughput predictions on multiple time scales,
from 1 to 10 seconds, along with an estimate of the prediction error
distribution. In addition to satisfying the latency constraint, the algorithm
heuristically maximizes the quality of experience by maximizing the average
video quality as a function of the number of skipped segments and quality
transitions. In order to select an efficient prediction method, we studied the
performance of several time series prediction methods in IEEE 802.11 wireless
access networks. We evaluated LOLYPOP under a large set of experimental
conditions limiting the transport latency to 3 seconds, against a
state-of-the-art adaptation algorithm from the literature, called FESTIVE. We
observed that the average video quality is by up to a factor of 3 higher than
with FESTIVE. We also observed that LOLYPOP is able to reach a broader region
in the quality of experience space, and thus it is better adjustable to the
user profile or service provider requirements.

representations that can be used for simulation and posterior inference. These
two classes and their constituent representations subsume existing ones that
have previously been developed in an ad hoc manner for specific processes.
Since a complete infinite-dimensional CRM cannot be used explicitly for

We provide truncation error analyses for each type of sequential
representation, as well as their normalized versions, thereby generalizing and
improving upon existing truncation error bounds in the literature. We analyze
the computational complexity of the sequential representations, which in
conjunction with our error bounds allows us to directly compare representations
and discuss their relative efficiency. We include numerous applications of our
theoretical results to commonly-used (normalized) CRMs, demonstrating that our
results enable a straightforward representation and analysis of CRMs that has

vacuum by a strong electric field can be enhanced tremendously via an
additional weaker time-dependent field. This dynamically assisted
Sauter-Schwinger effect has already been studied in several works. It has been
found that the enhancement mechanism depends on the shape of the weaker field.
For example, a Sauter pulse $1/\cosh(\omega t)^2$ and a Gaussian profile
$\exp(-\omega^2 t^2)$ exhibit significant, qualitative differences. However, so
far most of the analytical studies were focused on the exponent entering the
pair-creation probability. Here, we study the subleading prefactor in front of
the exponential using the worldline instanton method. We find that the main
features of the dynamically assisted Sauter-Schwinger effect, including the

3D Dirac and Weyl semimetals. Emphasis is placed on the approach to charge
neutrality and on the differences between Dirac and Weyl materials. At charge
neutrality, the zero-temperature limit of the dc conductivity is not universal
and also depends on the residual scattering model employed. However, the Lorenz
number L retains its usual value L_0. With increasing temperature, the
Wiedemann-Franz law is violated. At high temperatures, L exhibits a new plateau
at a value dependent on the details of the scattering rate. Such details can
also appear in the optical conductivity, both in the Drude response and
interband background. In the clean limit, the interband background is linear in
photon energy and always extrapolates to the origin. This background can be
shifted to the right through the introduction of a massless gap. In this case,
the extrapolation can cut the axis at a finite photon energy as is observed in
some experiments. It is also of interest to differentiate between the two types
of Weyl semimetals: those with broken time-reversal symmetry and those with
broken spatial-inversion symmetry. We show that, while the former will follow
the same behaviour as the 3D Dirac semimetals, for the zero magnetic field
properties discussed here, the latter type will show a double step in the
optical conductivity at finite doping and a single absorption edge at charge

rotation, and a spot configuration that is stable over about 16 years,
confirming the previous indications of a very stable magnetic field. We
observed small changes on a nightly timescale, and frequent flaring, including
a possible sympathetic flare. The strongest flares seem to be more concentrated
around the phase where the light curve indicates a smaller active region.
Spectral data suggest a complex CME with falling-back and re-ejected material,
with a maximal projected velocity of $\approx$675km/s. We observed a CME rate
much lower than expected from extrapolations of the solar flare-CME relation to
active stars.

techniques are applied to obtain radial profiles of the intensity of the star
formation rate in the recent past, and the local sSFR. To emphasize the
behavior of these properties for galaxies that are on and off the main sequence
of star formation (MSSF) we stack the individual radial profiles in bins of
galaxy morphology and stellar masses. Our main results are: a) The intensity of
SFR shows declining profiles that exhibit very little differences between
spirals. The dispersion between the profiles is significantly smaller in late
type spirals. This confirms that the MSSF is a sequence of galaxies with nearly
constant intensity of SFR b) sSFR values scale with Hubble type and increase
radially outwards, with a steeper slope in the inner 1 HLR. This behavior
suggests that galaxies are quenched inside-out, and that this process is faster
in the central, bulge-dominated part than in the disks. c) As a whole, and at
all radii, E and S0 are off the MSSF. d) Applying the volume-corrections for
the CALIFA sample, we obtain a density of star formation in the local Universe
of 0.0105 Msun/yr/Mpc^{-3}. Most of the star formation is occurring in the
disks of spirals. e) The volume averaged birthrate parameter, b'=0.39, suggests
that the present day Universe is forming stars at 1/3 of its past average rate.
E, S0, and the bulge of early type spirals contribute little to the recent SFR
of the Universe, which is dominated by the disks of later spirals. f) There is
a tight relation between the intensity of the SFR and stellar mass, defining a
local MSSF relation with a logarithmic slope of 0.8.

many dry mergers. However, details of the past merger history of present-day
ellipticals, such as the typical merger mass ratio, are difficult to constrain
observationally. Within the context and assumptions of the two-phase formation
scenario, we propose a straightforward method, using photometric data alone, to
estimate the average mass ratio of mergers that contributed to the build-up of
massive elliptical galaxies. We study a sample of nearby massive elliptical
galaxies selected from the Carnegie-Irvine Galaxy Survey, using two-dimensional
analysis to decompose their light distribution into an inner, denser component
plus an extended, outer envelope, each having a different optical color. The
combination of these two substructures accurately recovers the negative color
gradient exhibited by the galaxy as whole. The color difference between the two
components (<\Delta(B-V)> ~ 0.10 mag; <\Delta(B-R)> ~ 0.14 mag), based on the
slope of the M_stellar-color relation for nearby early-type galaxies, can be
translated into an estimate of the average mass ratio of the mergers. The rough
estimate, 1:5 to 1:10, is consistent with the expectation of the two-phase
formation scenario, suggesting that minor mergers were largely responsible for
building up to the outer stellar envelope of present-day massive ellipticals.
With the help of accurate photometry, large sample size, and more choices of
colors promised by ongoing and future surveys, the approach proposed here can
reveal more insights into the growth of massive galaxies during the last few
Gyr.

of the source performed in 2011, and re-analyzed in this work. The core

an ""extreme high-frequency-peaked BL Lac object"". Remarkably, we note that
since HESS J1943+213 does not reveal any optical or infrared signatures of the

if not its location close to the Galactic plane where the High Energy
Stereoscopic System has surveyed, and the follow-up dedicated X-ray and radio
studies triggered by the source detection in the TeV range. Our results suggest
therefore a presence of an unrecognized, possibly very numerous population of

Accepted for publication in MNRAS",,"10.1093/mnras/stw552",,"astro-ph.GA","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Two-body interactions play a major role in shaping the structural and
dynamical properties of globular clusters (GCs) over their long-term evolution.
In particular, GCs evolve toward a state of partial energy equipartition that
induces a mass-dependence in their kinematics. By using a set of Monte Carlo
cluster simulations evolved in quasi-isolation, we show that the stellar mass
dependence of the velocity dispersion $\sigma(m)$ can be described by an
exponential function $\sigma^2\propto \exp(-m/m_\mathrm{eq})$, with the
parameter $m_\mathrm{eq}$ quantifying the degree of partial energy
equipartition of the systems. This simple parametrization successfully captures
the behaviour of the velocity dispersion at lower as well as higher stellar
masses, that is, the regime where the system is expected to approach full
equipartition. We find a tight correlation between the degree of equipartition
reached by a GC and its dynamical state, indicating that clusters that are more
than about 20 core relaxation times old, have reached a maximum degree of
equipartition. This equipartition$-$dynamical state relation can be used as a
tool to characterize the relaxation condition of a cluster with a kinematic
measure of the $m_\mathrm{eq}$ parameter. Vice versa, the mass-dependence of
the kinematics can be predicted knowing the relaxation time solely on the basis
of photometric measurements. Moreover, any deviations from this tight relation
could be used as a probe of a peculiar dynamical history of a cluster. Finally,
our novel approach is important for the interpretation of state-of-the-art
Hubble Space Telescope proper motion data, for which the mass dependence of
kinematics can now be measured, and for the application of modeling techniques
which take into consideration multi-mass components and mass segregation.

structure beyond that revealed by more limited measures such as entanglement
entropy. In the thermalizing phase the entanglement spectrum obeys level
statistics governed by an appropriate random matrix ensemble. For Hamiltonian
systems this can be viewed as evidence in favor of a strong version of the
eigenstate thermalization hypothesis (ETH). Similar results are also obtained
for Floquet systems, where they constitute a result `beyond ETH', and show that
the corrections to ETH governing the Floquet entanglement spectrum have
statistical properties governed by a random matrix ensemble. The particular
random matrix ensemble governing the Floquet entanglement spectrum depends on
the symmetries of the Floquet drive, and therefore can depend on the choice of
origin of time. In the many body localized phase the entanglement spectrum is
also found to show level repulsion, following a semi-Poisson distribution (in
contrast to the energy spectrum, which follows a Poisson distribution). This
semi-Poisson distribution is found to come mainly from states at high
entanglement energies. The observed level repulsion only occurs for interacting
localized phases. We also demonstrate that equivalent results can be obtained
by calculating with a single typical eigenstate, or by averaging over a
microcanonical energy window - a surprising result in the localized phase. This
discovery of new structure in the pattern of entanglement of localized and
thermalizing phases may open up new lines of attack on many body localization,
thermalization, and the localization transition.

span multiple orbits over more than a year and reveal the presence of several
large prominences passing in front of both the M star and its white dwarf
companion, allowing us to triangulate their positions. Despite showing small
variations on a timescale of days, they persist for more than a year and may
last decades. One large prominence extends almost three stellar radii from the
M star. Roche tomography reveals that the M star is heavily spotted and that
these spots are long-lived and in relatively fixed locations, preferentially
found on the hemisphere facing the white dwarf. We also determine precise
binary and physical parameters for the system. We find that the 14,220 +/- 350K
white dwarf is relatively massive, 0.782 +/- 0.013Ms, and has a radius of
0.01068 +/- 0.00007Rs, consistent with evolutionary models. The tidally
distorted M star has a mass of 0.382 +/- 0.006Ms and a radius of 0.381 +/-
0.003Rs, also consistent with evolutionary models. We find that the magnesium
absorption line from the white dwarf is broader than expected. This could be
due to rotation (implying a spin period of only ~700 seconds), or due to a weak
(~100kG) magnetic field, we favour the latter interpretation. Since the M
star's radius is still within its Roche lobe and there is no evidence that its
over-inflated we conclude that QS Vir is most likely a pre-cataclysmic binary
just about to become semi-detached.

parametric models to curves, to a completely model-independent wavelet
approach. We cover a range of representative machine learning algorithms,
including naive Bayes, k-nearest neighbors, support vector machines, artificial

simulated multi-band DES light curves from the Supernova Photometric

the Receiver Operating Characteristic as a metric, we find that the SALT2 fits
and the wavelet approach, with the BDTs algorithm, each achieves an AUC of
0.98, where 1 represents perfect classification. We find that a representative
training set is essential for good classification, whatever the feature set or
algorithm, with implications for spectroscopic follow-up. Importantly, we find
that by using either the SALT2 or the wavelet feature sets with a BDT
algorithm, accurate classification is possible purely from light curve data,
without the need for any redshift information.

interaction of the molecular cloud and the nonthermal source enhances the
cosmic-ray ionization rate, allows the diffusion of cosmic rays into the cloud

have been recently observed at radio frequencies. Their radio emission is
powered by relativistic electrons that can be either accelerated at the SN
shock (primaries) or injected as a by-product (secondaries) of inelastic
proton-proton collisions. We investigate the radio signatures from secondary
electrons, by detailing a semi-analytical model to calculate the temporal
evolution of the distributions of protons, primary and secondary electrons.
With our formalism, we track the cooling history of all the particles that have
been injected into the emission region up to a given time, and calculate the
resulting radio spectra and light curves. For a SN shock propagating through
the progenitor wind, we find that secondary electrons control the early radio
signatures, but their contribution decays faster than that of primary
electrons. This results in a flattening of the light curve at a given radio
frequency that depends only upon the radial profiles of the CSM density and of
the shock velocity, $v_0$. The relevant transition time at the peak frequency
is $\sim 190 \, K_{\rm ep,-3}^{-1} A_{\rm w, 16} \beta_{0, -1.5}^{-2}\,{\rm
d}$, where $A_{\rm w}$ is the wind mass-loading parameter, $\beta_0=v_0/c$ and
$K_{\rm ep}$ is the electron-to-proton ratio of accelerated particles. We
explicitly show that late peak times at 5 GHz (i.e., $t_{\rm pk} \gtrsim
300-1000$ d) suggest a shock wave propagating in a dense wind ($A_{\rm w}

find spectral breaks in the PSD at a timescale comparable to the dominant
characteristic time scale in the system, which is usually the pre-defined decay
time scale of an acceleration event. Cooling imposes a delay, and so PSDs taken
at lower energy bands in each emission component (synchrotron or inverse
Compton) generally break at longer timescales. The flux-flux correlation
between X-rays and TeV {\gamma}-rays can be either quadratic or linear,
depending on whether or not there are large variation of the injection into the

Results of this thesis show that state of atmospheric convection impacts the

surface of the ocean. This warm layer drives an anomalous flux from the ocean
to the atmosphere. A novel Kelvin wave trajectory database based on satellite
data is introduced in this study. The investigation of its data shows that
substantial fraction of Kelvin waves is initiated as a result of interaction
with another Kelvin wave. Two distinct categories are defined and analyzed: the
two- and multiple Kelvin wave initiations, and a spin off initiation. Results
show that primary forcing of such waves are high diurnal cycle and/or increased
wind speed and latent heat flux at the ocean surface. Variability of the ocean
surface and subsurface along Kelvin wave trajectories over Indian Ocean is
investigated: wind speed and latent heat flux increase and a sea surface
temperature anomaly decreases during a wave passage. It is also shown that
Kelvin waves are longitude-diurnal cycle phase locked over the Maritime
Continent. This cycle phase locking is such that it agrees with mean, local
diurnal cycle of convection in the atmosphere. The strength of the
longitude-diurnal cycle phase locking differs between non-blocked Kelvin waves,
which make successful transition over the Maritime Continent, and blocked waves
that terminate within it. The distance between the islands of Sumatra and
Borneo agrees with the distance travelled by an average Kelvin wave in one day.
This suggests that the Maritime Continent may act as a filter, favoring
successful propagation waves, which are in phase with the local diurnal cycle
of convection.

quantum analogue of NP, admit quantum verifiers that only act on a constant
number of qubits of a polynomial size quantum proof and have a constant gap
between completeness and soundness. Despite an impressive body of work trying
to prove or disprove the quantum PCP conjecture, it still remains widely open.
The above-mentioned proof verification statement has also been shown equivalent
to the QMA-completeness of the Local Hamiltonian problem with constant relative
gap. Nevertheless, unlike in the classical case, no equivalent formulation in
the language of multi-prover games is known.
  In this work, we propose a new type of quantum proof systems, the Pointer
QPCP, where a verifier first accesses a classical proof that he can use as a
pointer to which qubits from the quantum part of the proof to access. We define
the Pointer QPCP conjecture, that states that all problems in QMA admit quantum
verifiers that first access a logarithmic number of bits from the classical
part of a polynomial size proof, then act on a constant number of qubits from
the quantum part of the proof, and have a constant gap between completeness and
soundness. We define a new QMA-complete problem, the Set Local Hamiltonian
problem, and a new restricted class of quantum multi-prover games, called CRESP
games. We use them to provide two other equivalent statements to the Pointer
QPCP conjecture: the Set Local Hamiltonian problem with constant relative gap
is QMA-complete; and the approximation of the maximum acceptance probability of
CRESP games up to a constant additive factor is as hard as QMA. This is the
first equivalence between a quantum PCP statement and the inapproximability of
quantum multi-prover games.

these areas. This way we can compute 1015-vertex graphs with tens of thousands

the conductance between source and drain contacts. In atomic-scale transistors,
this conductance is exquisitely sensitive to single electrons hopping via
individual orbitals. Single-electron transport in molecular transistors has
been previously studied using top-down approaches to gating, such as
lithography and break junctions. But atomically precise control of the gate -
which is crucial to transistor action at the smallest size scales - is not
possible with these approaches. Here, we used individual charged atoms,
manipulated by a scanning tunnelling microscope, to create the electrical gates
for a single-molecule transistor. This degree of control allowed us to tune the
molecule into the regime of sequential single-electron tunnelling, albeit with
a conductance gap more than one order of magnitude larger than observed
previously. This unexpected behaviour arises from the existence of two
different orientational conformations of the molecule, depending on its charge

individuals most important for monitoring or preventing outbreaks are selected

Although targeted strategies carry a strong potential, identifying optimal
target groups remains a challenge. Here we consider the problem of identifying
target groups based on digital communication networks (telecommunication,
online social media) in order to predict and contain an infectious disease
spreading on a real-world person-to-person network of more than 500

be determined based on both telecommunication and online social network

communication networks improves the efficacy for short-range disease
transmissions but, surprisingly, performance is severely reduced in the case of
long-range transmission. These results are robust with respect to the strategy
used to identify targeted individuals and time-gap between identification of
targets and the intervention. Thus, we demonstrate that data available from

thermotropic liquid crystalline (LC) dimers, represents a new orientationally
ordered mesophase -- the first distinct nematic variant discovered in many
years. The $\mathrm{N_{TB}}$ phase is distinguished by a heliconical winding of
the average molecular long axis (director) with a remarkably short (nanoscale)
pitch and, in systems of achiral dimers, with an equal probability to form
right- and left-handed domains. The $\mathrm{N_{TB}}$ structure thus provides
another fascinating example of spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking in nature.
The order parameter driving the formation of the heliconical state has been
theoretically conjectured to be a polarization field, deriving from the bent
conformation of the dimers, that rotates helically with the same nanoscale
pitch as the director field. It therefore presents a significant challenge for
experimental detection. Here we report a second harmonic light scattering
(SHLS) study on two achiral, $\mathrm{N_{TB}}$-forming LCs, which is sensitive
to the polarization field due to micron-scale distortion of the helical
structure associated with naturally-occurring textural defects. These defects
are parabolic focal conics of smectic-like ""pseudo-layers"", defined by planes
of equivalent phase in a coarse-grained description of the $\mathrm{N_{TB}}$
state. Our SHLS data are explained by a coarse-grained free energy density that
combines a Landau-deGennes expansion of the polarization field, the elastic
energy of a nematic, and a linear coupling between the two.

Full Version",,"10.1145/2897845.2897876",,"cs.CR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Offline attacks on passwords are increasingly commonplace and dangerous. An
offline adversary is limited only by the amount of computational resources he
or she is willing to invest to crack a user's password. The danger is
compounded by the existence of authentication servers who fail to adopt proper
password storage practices like key-stretching. Password managers can help
mitigate these risks by adopting key stretching procedures like hash iteration
or memory hard functions to derive site specific passwords from the user's
master password on the client-side. While key stretching can reduce the offline
adversary's success rate, these procedures also increase computational costs
for a legitimate user. Motivated by the observation that most of the password
guesses of the offline adversary will be incorrect, we propose a client side
cost asymmetric secure hashing scheme (Client-CASH). Client-CASH randomizes the
runtime of client-side key stretching procedure in a way that the expected
computational cost of our key derivation function is greater when run with an
incorrect master password. We make several contributions. First, we show how to
introduce randomness into a client-side key stretching algorithms through the
use of halting predicates which are selected randomly at the time of account
creation. Second, we formalize the problem of finding the optimal running time
distribution subject to certain cost constraints for the client and certain
security constrains on the halting predicates. Finally, we demonstrate that
Client-CASH can reduce the adversary's success rate by up to $21\%$. These
results demonstrate the promise of the Client-CASH mechanism.

important cosmological probes for current and future large scale surveys of
galaxies, such as the Dark Energy Survey. In order to combine them one has to
account for the fact that they are not independent quantities, since they probe
the same density field. It is important to develop a good understanding of
their correlation in order to extract parameter constraints. We present a
detailed modelling of the joint covariance matrix between cluster number counts
and the galaxy angular power spectrum. We employ the framework of the halo
model complemented by a Halo Occupation Distribution model (HOD). We
demonstrate the importance of accounting for non-Gaussianity to produce
accurate covariance predictions. Indeed, we show that the non-Gaussian
covariance becomes dominant at small scales, low redshifts or high cluster
masses. We discuss in particular the case of the super-sample covariance (SSC),
including the effects of galaxy shot-noise, halo second order bias and
non-local bias. We demonstrate that the SSC obeys mathematical inequalities and
positivity. Using the joint covariance matrix and a Fisher matrix methodology,
we examine the prospects of combining these two probes to constrain
cosmological and HOD parameters. We find that the combination indeed results in
noticeably better constraints, with improvements of order 20\% on cosmological
parameters compared to the best single probe, and even greater improvement on
HOD parameters, with reduction of error bars by a factor 1.4-4.8. This happens
in particular because the cross-covariance introduces a synergy between the
probes on small scales. We conclude that accounting for non-Gaussian effects is
required for the joint analysis of these observables in galaxy surveys.

show the emergence of orthophosphate Q0 units on addition of Er2O3. The
saturation of Er solubility is found to be between 0.25 and 0.5 mol$\%$ Er2O3.
An increase of the glass transition temperature from $\sim$80{\deg}C in undoped
glass to $\sim$87{\deg}C in samples doped with 0.25 mol$\%$ Er2O3 was also
observed. This process is accompanied by an increase in the difference between
the crystallisation and glass transition temperatures, which is usually

Transients (SFXTs) are two types of High-mass X-ray Binaries (HMXBs) that
present similar donors but, at the same time, show very different behavior in
the X-rays. The reason for this dichotomy of wind-fed HMXBs is still a matter
of debate. Among the several explanations that have been proposed, some of them
invoke specific stellar wind properties of the donor stars. Only dedicated
empiric analysis of the donors' stellar wind can provide the required
information to accomplish an adequate test of these theories. However, such
analyses are scarce. To close this gap, we perform a comparative analysis of
the optical companion in two important systems: IGR J17544-2619 (SFXT) and Vela
X-1 (SGXB). We analyse the spectra of each star in detail and derive their
stellar and wind properties. We compare the wind parameters, giving us an
excellent chance of recognizing key differences between donor winds in SFXTs
and SGXBs. We find that the stellar parameters derived from the analysis
generally agree well with the spectral types of the two donors: O9I (IGR
J17544-2619) and B0.5Iae (Vela X-1). An important difference between the
stellar winds of the two stars is their terminal velocities v_inf=1500km/s in
IGR J17544-2619 and v_inf=700km/s in Vela~X-1, which has important consequences
on the X-ray luminosity of these sources. Their specific combination of wind
speed and pulsar spin favours an accretion regime with a persistently high
luminosity in Vela X-1, while it favours an inhibiting accretion mechanism in
IGR~J17544-2619. Our study demonstrates that the wind relative velocity is
critical in the determination of the class of HMXBs hosting a supergiant donor,
given that it may shift the accretion mechanism from direct accretion to
propeller regimes when combined with other parameters.

ferromagnetic states with magnetization pointing up/down, by sequential
increase and decrease of the perpendicular magnetic anisotropy. The switching
between these states is explained by the fact that the spin texture

bounded domains. In general, there are two scenarios of evolution. Either the
solution behaves in an oscillatory, quasiperiodic manner or the nonlinear
effects cause the energy to concentrate on smaller scales leading to a
turbulent behaviour. Which of these two possibilities occurs depends on a model
and the initial conditions. In the quasiperiodic scenario there exist very
special time-periodic solutions. They result for a delicate balance between
dispersion and nonlinear interaction. The main body of this dissertation is
concerned with construction (by means of perturbative and numerical methods) of
time-periodic solutions for various nonlinear wave equations on bounded
domains. While turbulence is mainly associated with hydrodynamics, recent
research in General Relativity has also revealed turbulent phenomena. Numerical
studies of a self-gravitating massless scalar field in spherical symmetry gave
evidence that anti-de Sitter space is unstable against black hole formation. On
the other hand there appeared many examples of asymptotically anti-de Sitter
solutions which evade turbulent behaviour and appear almost periodic for long
times. We discuss here these two contrasting scenarios putting special
attention to the construction and properties of strictly time-periodic
solutions. We analyze different models where solutions of this type exist.
Moreover, we describe similarities and differences among these models
concerning properties of time-periodic solutions and methods used for their
construction.

We model the problem within a network flow framework and show that under
relatively mild assumptions the rebalancing vehicles, if properly coordinated,
do not lead to an increase in congestion (in stark contrast to common belief).
From an algorithmic standpoint, such theoretical insight suggests that the
problem of routing customers and rebalancing vehicles can be decoupled, which
leads to a computationally-efficient routing and rebalancing algorithm for the
autonomous vehicles. Numerical experiments and case studies corroborate our
theoretical insights and show that the proposed algorithm outperforms
state-of-the-art point-to-point methods by avoiding excess congestion on the

congestion-aware, system-wide coordination of autonomously driving vehicles,

be responsible for flares on the Sun and stars. Nevertheless, such
flare-related reconnection is mostly detected to occur in the corona, while
there have been few studies concerning the reconnection in the chromosphere or
photosphere. Here we present both spectroscopic and imaging observations of
magnetic reconnection in the chromosphere leading to a microflare. During the
flare peak time, chromospheric line profiles show significant
blueshifted/redshifted components on the two sides of the flaring site,
corresponding to upflows and downflows with velocities of $\pm$(70--80) km
s$^{-1}$, comparable with the local Alfv\'{e}n speed as expected by the
reconnection in the chromosphere. The three-dimensional nonlinear force-free
field configuration further discloses twisted field lines (a flux rope) at a
low altitude, cospatial with the dark threads in He I 10830 \r{A} images. The
instability of the flux rope may initiate the flare-related reconnection. These
observations provide clear evidence of magnetic reconnection in the
chromosphere and show the similar mechanisms of a microflare to those of major
flares.

nontrivial extension of the theory of `geometric zeta functions' of bounded
fractal strings. In this memoir, we introduce the class of `relative fractal
drums' (or RFDs), which contains the classes of bounded fractal strings and of
compact fractal subsets of Euclidean spaces as special cases. Furthermore, the
associated (relative) distance zeta functions of RFDs, extend (in a suitable
sense) the aforementioned classes of fractal zeta functions. This notion is
very general and flexible, enabling us to view practically all of the
previously studied aspects of the theory of fractal zeta functions from a
unified perspective as well as to go well beyond the previous theory. The
abscissa of (absolute) convergence of any relative fractal drum is equal to the
relative box dimension of the RFD. We pay particular attention to the question
of constructing meromorphic extensions of the distance zeta functions of RFDs,
as well as to the construction of transcendentally $\infty$-quasiperiodic RFDs
(i.e., roughly, RFDs with infinitely many quasiperiods, all of which are
algebraically independent). We also describe a class of RFDs (and, in
particular, a new class of bounded sets), called {\em maximal hyperfractals},
such that the critical line of (absolute) convergence consists solely of
nonremovable singularities of the associated relative distance zeta functions.
Finally, we also describe a class of Minkowski measurable RFDs which possess an
infinite sequence of complex dimensions of arbitrary multiplicity $m\ge1$, and
even an infinite sequence of essential singularities along the critical line.

to define a circumstellar habitable zone: the locus of orbital radii in which
the planet is neither too hot nor too cold for life as we know it. One
dimensional climate models have identified theoretically impressive boundaries
for this zone: a runaway greenhouse or water loss at the inner edge (Venus),
and low-latitude glaciation followed by formation of CO2 clouds at the outer
edge. A cottage industry now exists to ""refine"" the definition of these
boundaries each year to the third decimal place of an AU. Using the same class
of climate model, I show that the different climate states can overlap very
substantially and that ""snowball Earth"", moist temperate climate, hot moist
climate and a post-runaway dry climate can all be stable under the same solar
flux. The radial extent of the temperate climate band is very narrow for pure
water atmospheres, but can be widened with di-nitrogen and carbon dioxide. The
width of the habitable zone is thus determined by the atmospheric inventories
of these gases. Yet Earth teaches us that these abundances are very heavily
influenced (perhaps even controlled) by biology. This is paradoxical: the
habitable zone seeks to define the region a planet should be capable of
harbouring life; yet whether the planet is inhabited will determine whether the
climate may be habitable at any given distance from the star. This matters,
because future life detection missions may use habitable zone boundaries in
mission design.

The existence and precise definition of higher-order hierarchies, such as
division into species, is open to debate among biologists. First, we seek to
show a fractal structure of species. We are able to define a species as a
$p$-Sylow subgroup of a particular community in a single niche, confirmed by
topological analysis. We named this model the patch with zeta dominance (PzDom)
model. Next, the topological nature of the system is carefully examined and for
testing purposes, species density data are used in conjunction with data
derived from liquid-chromatography mass spectrometry of proteins. We confirm
the induction of hierarchy and time through a one-dimensional probability space
with certain topologies. For further clarification of induced fractals
including the relation to renormalization in physics, a theoretical development
is proposed based on a newly identified fact, namely that scaling parameters
for magnetization exactly correspond to imaginary parts of the Riemann zeta
function's nontrivial zeros. A master torus and a Lagrangian/Hamiltonian are
derived expressing fractal structures as a solution for diminishing divergent
terms in renormalization. We will also focus on an application of our developed
model. We extend current PzDom model to the so-called exPzDom model to qualify
population dynamics as a topological matter as a whole, not focusing on
hierarchy. The indicators in the exPzDom model adhere well to the empirical
dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 infected people and align appropriately with actual
policies instituted by the Japanese government. In our patch with zeta

procedures are also increasing with the aging population and precise diagnosis
plays a vital role in reducing complication and recurrence of symptoms. Spinal
imaging of vertebral column is a tedious process subjected to interpretation
errors. In this contribution, we aim to reduce time and error for vertebral
interpretation by applying and studying the GrowCut-algorithm for boundary
segmentation between vertebral body compacta and surrounding structures.
GrowCut is a competitive region growing algorithm using cellular automata. For
our study, vertebral T2-weighted Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) scans were
first manually outlined by neurosurgeons. Then, the vertebral bodies were
segmented in the medical images by a GrowCut-trained physician using the
semi-automated GrowCut-algorithm. Afterwards, results of both segmentation
processes were compared using the Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC) and the
Hausdorff Distance (HD) which yielded to a DSC of 82.99+/-5.03% and a HD of
18.91+/-7.2 voxel, respectively. In addition, the times have been measured
during the manual and the GrowCut segmentations, showing that a
GrowCut-segmentation - with an average time of less than six minutes
(5.77+/-0.73) - is significantly shorter than a pure manual outlining.

graph-based segmentation scheme with a user-defined template. The scheme
creates a directed two dimensional graph, followed by the minimal cost closed

graphs outline is dynamically adapted to the last calculated cut. Evaluation

scalars can possess exotic `Higgs' bosons with vanishing or suppressed
couplings to Standard Model fermions. These `fermiophobic' scalars, which
cannot be produced via gluon fusion, are constrained by LHC measurements of the
125 GeV Higgs boson to have a small vacuum expectation value. This implies that
vector boson fusion and associated vector boson production are in general
suppressed rendering conventional Higgs searches insensitive. However,
Drell-Yan Higgs pair production, which is not present in the SM, can be
sizeable even in the limit of vanishing exotic Higgs vacuum expectation value.
We utilize this to show that diphoton searches at 8 TeV LHC already rule out a
large class of neutral fermiophobic Higgs bosons below around 110 GeV. This
includes fermiophobic scalars found in two Higgs doublet as well as Higgs
triplet and Georgi-Machacek type models. Our results extend the only relevant
limit on fermiophobic Higgs bosons obtained by a recent CDF analysis of
$4\gamma + X$ Tevatron data. Furthermore, diphoton limits are independent of
the decay of the second Higgs boson and thus apply even for degenerate masses
in contrast to the CDF search. We also find that if the fermiophobic Higgs has
very enhanced couplings to photons, masses as large as $\sim 150$ GeV can be
ruled out while if these couplings are somehow highly suppressed, masses below
$\sim 90$ GeV can still be ruled out. Finally, we show that $WW$ and $ZZ$
diboson searches may serve as complementary probes for masses above the
diphoton limit up to $\sim 250$ GeV and discuss prospects at 13 TeV LHC.

used to denote when the variation in the position of an observer implies
variation in properties or measures on the observed object. We know, from
Skolem theorem, that there are first-order models where the set of real numbers
is countable and some where it is not. This fact depends on the position of the

depends on whether he/she is inside the model or not and in this particular

is based on finiteness rather than natural numbers and discuss Turing machines
computable morphisms defined on top of the sole notion finiteness. We explore
the relativity of finiteness in models provided by toposes where the Axiom of
Choice (AC) does not hold, since Tarski proved that if AC holds then all
finiteness notions are equivalent. Our toposes do not have natural numbers

equivalent to Peano finiteness going back to computation on top of Natural

inside every topos, with the properties previously stated, the computation
model is standard, from outside some of these toposes, unexpected properties on

  Conference",,,,"cs.RO","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Change detection, i.e., anomaly detection from local maps built by a mobile
robot at multiple different times, is a challenging problem to solve in
practice. Most previous work either cannot be applied to scenarios where the
size of the map collection is large, or simply assumed that the robot
self-location is globally known. In this paper, we tackle the problem of
simultaneous self-localization and change detection, by reformulating the
problem as a map retrieval problem, and propose a local map descriptor with a
compressed bag-of-words (BoW) structure as a scalable solution. We make the
following contributions. (1) To enable a direct comparison of the spatial
layout of visual features between different local maps, the origin of the local
map coordinate (termed ""viewpoint"") is planned by scene parsing and determined
by our ""viewpoint planner"" to be invariant against small variations in
self-location and changes, aiming at providing similar viewpoints for similar
scenes (i.e., the relevant map pair). (2) We extend the BoW model to enable the
use of not only the appearance (e.g., polestar) but also the spatial layout
(e.g., spatial pyramid) of visual features with respect to the planned
viewpoint. The key observation is that the planned viewpoint (i.e., the origin
of local map coordinate) acts as a pseudo viewpoint that is usually required by
spatial BoW (e.g., SPM) and also by anomaly detection (e.g., NN-d, LOF). (3)
Experimental results on a challenging ""loop-closing"" scenario show that the
proposed method outperforms previous BoW methods in self-localization, and
furthermore, that the use of both appearance and pose information in change
detection produces better results than the use of either information alone.

  Collective potentials and nonperturbative cranking collective inertia tensors
are calculated using the multidimensionally-constrained relativistic mean-field
(MDC-RMF) model. Pairing correlations are treated in the BCS approximation
using a separable pairing force of finite range. Pairing fluctuations are
included as a collective variable using a constraint on particle-number
dispersion. Fission paths are determined with the dynamic programming method by
minimizing the action in multidimensional collective spaces.
  The dynamics of spontaneous fission of $^{264}$Fm and $^{250}$Fm are
explored. Fission paths, action integrals and corresponding half-lives computed
in the three-dimensional collective space of shape and pairing coordinates,
using the relativistic functional DD-PC1 and a separable pairing force of
finite range, are compared with results obtained without pairing fluctuations.
Results for $^{264}$Fm are also discussed in relation with those recently
obtained using the HFB model.
  The inclusion of pairing correlations in the space of collective coordinates
favors axially symmetric shapes along the dynamic path of the fissioning
system, amplifies pairing as the path traverses the fission barriers,
significantly reduces the action integral and shortens the corresponding SF
half-life.

The time evolution of these states can have long decay time where up to hundred

decayed Rabi-like oscillations with a beating frequency determined by the
difference of cooperative Lamb shift in the subspace. Experimental requirements
are also discussed for practical implementation of the subradiant states. Our

temperature, where the non-singlet chiral symmetry is restored. We first
summarize the previous theoretical investigation on the relation between the
eigenvalue density of the Dirac operator and the axial U(1) symmetry. We show
that the eigenvalue density near the origin behaves as $\lambda^\gamma$ with
$\gamma > 2$ in the chirally symmetric phase, where $\lambda$ is an eigenvalue.
This implies that the axial U(1) symmetry is partially restored, so that the
low energy symmetry of the theory becomes SU(2)$\otimes$ SU(2)$\otimes$ Z$_4$.
Secondly, we report recent numerical investigations on this issue by lattice
QCD simulations with lattice chiral fermions such as Overlap or improved
domain-wall fermions. Our preliminary results indicate that the eigenvalue
density seems to have a gap at the origin just above $T_c$, the temperature of
the chiral symmetry restoration, which implies the axial U(1) symmetry is
effectively restored at high temperature. We also point out an importance of
the exact lattice chiral symmetry to obtain correct results on this issue.

non-magnetic core, which prevents magnons from entering and consequently
distorts the spin wave propagation, can be cloaked by a structured magnetic

mechanisms. We discuss the feasibility of the proposed mechanisms in an

years as the premier scenario used to account for several observed features of
the inner solar system. It relies on early migration of the giant planets to
gravitationally sculpt and mix the planetesimal disc down to ~1 AU, after which
the terrestrial planets accrete from material left in a narrow circum-solar
annulus. Here we have investigated how the model fares under a range of initial
conditions and migration course-change (`tack') locations. We have run a large
number of N-body simulations with a tack location of 1.5 AU and 2 AU and tested
initial conditions using equal mass planetary embryos and a semi-analytical
approach to oligarchic growth. We make use of a recent model of the protosolar
disc that takes account of viscous heating, include the full effect of type 1
migration, and employ a realistic mass-radius relation for the growing
terrestrial planets. Results show that the canonical tack location of Jupiter
at 1.5 AU is inconsistent with the most massive planet residing at 1 AU at
greater than 95% confidence. This favours a tack farther out at 2 AU for the
disc model and parameters employed. Of the different initial conditions, we
find that the oligarchic case is capable of statistically reproducing the
orbital architecture and mass distribution of the terrestrial planets, while
the equal mass embryo case is not.

We identify 939 WDMS binaries within the data releases (DR) 9-12 of SDSS plus
40 objects from DR 1-8 that we missed in our previous works, 646 of which are
new. The total number of spectroscopic SDSS WDMS binaries increases to 3294.
This is by far the largest and most homogeneous sample of compact binaries
currently available. We use a decomposition/fitting routine to derive the
stellar parameters of all systems identified here (white dwarf effective
temperatures, surface gravities and masses, and secondary star spectral types).
The analysis of the corresponding stellar parameter distributions shows that
the SDSS WDMS binary population is seriously affected by selection effects. We
also measure the NaI 8183.27, 8194.81 absorption doublet and Halpha emission
radial velocities (RV) from all SDSS WDMS binary spectra identified in this
work. 98 objects are found to display RV variations, 62 of which are new. The
RV data are sufficient enough to estimate the orbital periods of three close
binaries.

gap, the hybridization gap, and the effective gap with the core radius and
shell thickness of the nanowires. The evolutions of all the energy gaps with
the structural parameters are shown to be dominantly governed by quantum size

exists only at intermediate shell thicknesses. The maximum gap is $\sim 4.4$
meV for GaSb/InAs and $\sim 3.5$ meV for InAs/GaSb core-shell nanowires, and
for the GaSb/InAs core-shell nanowires the gap persists over a wider range of
geometrical parameters. The intrinsic reason for these differences between the
two types of nanowires is that in the shell the electron-like states of InAs is
more delocalized than the hole-like state of GaSb, while in the core the
hole-like state of GaSb is more delocalized than the electron-like state of
InAs, and both features favor stronger electron-hole hybridization. Since
similar features of the electron- and hole-like states have been found in
nanowires of other materials, it could serve as a common rule to put the
hole-like state in the core while the electron-like state in the shell of a

demonstrated by the increases of both Tconset and upper critical field (Hc2).
This can be interpreted as a result of increase in density of states under

the weights and activations in a trained network naturally have non-uniform

weights, communicate activations, and perform dot-products enables networks to
1) achieve higher classification accuracies than fixed-point at the same

end-to-end training procedure that uses log representation at 5-bits, which
achieves higher final test accuracy than linear at 5-bits.

individuals with the same genotype have a higher probability to mate and
produce a viable offspring. The population is subdivided in several patches and
individuals may migrate between them. We show that mating preferences by
themselves, even if they are very small, are enough to entail reproductive
isolation between patches, and we provide the time needed for this isolation to
occur as a function of the population size. Our results rely on a fine study of
the stochastic process and of its deterministic limit in large population,
which is given by a system of coupled nonlinear differential equations.

injected electrons, where target photons are assumed to be provided by the
accretion disk and broad line region. We calculate the non-thermal photon
spectra produced by inverse Compton scattering of these external target
radiation fields using the full Compton cross-section in the head-on

resulting ambient electron and photon spectra, and discuss the influence of
each injection parameter. Varying the injection parameters has a notable
influence on the spectral shapes, which can be used to set constraints on the
injection scenarios. We apply our model to the flare state spectral energy
distribution of 3C454.3, and to the FSRQ PKS1510-089. For both sources we show
two different model fits, corresponding to different injection scenarios. In
all four injection scenarios impulsive particle injection is disfavored. Our

Curie law. The critical response of a boundary impurity is logarithmically
divergent and maps to the two-channel Kondo problem, while it saturates for
critical bulk impurities, as well as in the ordered phase. The results for the
Ising chain translate to the related problem of a resonant level coupled to a
1d p-wave superconductor or a Peierls chain, whereby the magnetic order is
mapped to topological order. We find that the topological phase always exhibits
a continuous impurity response to local fields as a result of the level
repulsion of local levels from the boundary Majorana zero mode. In contrast,
the disordered phase generically features a discontinuous magnetization or
charging response. This difference constitutes a general thermodynamic
fingerprint of topological order in phases with a bulk gap.

notable properties, this operad is the Koszul dual of the dendriform operad. We
introduce here, by adopting the point of view and the tools offered by the

$\gamma$-pluriassociative algebras. We exhibit a realization of these operads,
establish several presentations by generators and relations, compute their
Hilbert series, show that they are Koszul, and construct the free objects in
the corresponding categories. We also study several notions of units in

discovered additional variability with period shorter than first overtone
period, and period ratios in the (0.60, 0.65) range. In the Petersen diagram
these stars form three well separated sequences. The additional variability
cannot correspond to other radial mode. This form of pulsation is still
puzzling.
  We find that amplitude of the additional variability is small, typically 2-4
per cent of the first overtone amplitude, which corresponds to 2-5 mmag. In
some stars we find simultaneously two close periodicities corresponding to two
sequences in the Petersen diagram. The most important finding is the detection
of power excess at half the frequency of the additional variability (at
subharmonic) in 35 per cent of the analysed stars. Interestingly, power excess
at subharmonic frequency is detected mostly for stars of the middle sequence in
the Petersen diagram (74 per cent), incidence rate is much lower for stars of
the top sequence (31 per cent), and phenomenon is not detected for stars of the
bottom sequence. The amplitude and/or phase of the additional periodicities
strongly vary in time.
  Similar form of pulsation is observed in first overtone RR Lyrae stars. Our
results indicate that the nature and cause of this form of pulsation is the
same in the two groups of classical pulsators; consequently, a common model
explaining this form of pulsation should be searched for. Our results favour
the theory of the excitation of non-radial modes of angular degrees 7, 8 and 9,

studied its flaring activity close to the DSO/G2 pericenter passage to
constrain the physical properties and origin of the flares.
Simultaneous/coordinated observations were made in 2014 Feb-Apr with
XMM-Newton, HST/WFC3, VLT/SINFONI, VLA and CARMA. We detected 2 X-ray and 3 NIR
flares on Mar. 10 and Apr. 2 with XMM-Newton and HST and 2 NIR flares on Apr. 3
and 4 with VLT. The Mar. 10 X-ray flare has a long rise and a rapid decay. Its
NIR counterpart peaked 4320s before the X-ray peak implying a variation in the
X-ray-to-NIR flux ratio. This flare may be a single flare where change in the
flux ratio is explained by the adiabatic compression of a plasmon or 2 close
flares with simultaneous X-ray/NIR peaks. We observed an increase in the rising
radio flux density on Mar. 10 with the VLA. It could be the delayed emission
from a NIR/X-ray flare preceding our observation. The Apr. 2 X-ray flare
occurred for HST in the Earth occultation of Sgr A*. We thus only observed the
start of its NIR counterpart. After the occultation, we observed the decay
phase of a bright NIR flare with no X-ray counterpart. On Apr. 3, 2 CARMA
flares were observed. The 1rst one may be the delayed emission of a VLT NIR
flare. We thus observed 7 NIR flares whose 3 have an X-ray counterpart. We
studied the physical parameters of the flaring region for each NIR flare but
none of the possible radiative processes can be ruled out for the X-ray flares
creation. Our X-ray flaring rate is consistent with those observed in the 2012
Chandra XVP campaign. No increase in the flaring activity was thus triggered
close to the DSO/G2 pericenter passage. Moreover, higher X-ray flaring rates
had already been observed with no increase in the quiescent level. There is
thus no direct link between an X-ray flaring-rate increase and an
accretion-rate change. (abridged)

implies a new contribution to the velocity field which is a function of the

facilitating per-impression auctions to buy ad impressions as they are being
generated. Being able to use impression-level data, such as user cookies,
encourages user behaviour targeting, and hence has significantly improved the
effectiveness of ad campaigns. However, a fundamental drawback of RTB is its
instability because the bid decision is made per impression and there are
enormous fluctuations in campaigns' key performance indicators (KPIs). As such,
advertisers face great difficulty in controlling their campaign performance
against the associated costs. In this paper, we propose a feedback control
mechanism for RTB which helps advertisers dynamically adjust the bids to
effectively control the KPIs, e.g., the auction winning ratio and the effective
cost per click. We further formulate an optimisation framework to show that the
proposed feedback control mechanism also has the ability of optimising campaign
performance. By settling the effective cost per click at an optimal reference
value, the number of campaign's ad clicks can be maximised with the budget
constraint. Our empirical study based on real-world data verifies the
effectiveness and robustness of our RTB control system in various situations.
The proposed feedback control mechanism has also been deployed on a commercial

single-input/single-output systems in terms of singularities of the transfer

fairly general class of transfer functions F(s) is considered which can roughly
be characterized by two properties: (1) F(s) is meromorphic with a finite
number of poles in the open right half plane and (2), on the imaginary axes,
F(s) may have at most a finite number of poles and branch points. For this
class of systems, a complete and thorough characterization of BIBO stability in
terms of the singularities in the closed right half-plane is developed where no
necessity arises to differentiate between commensurate and incommensurate
orders of branch points as often done in literature. A necessary and sufficient
condition for BIBO stability is derived which mainly relies on the asymptotic
expansion of the impulse response f(t). The second main result is the
generalization of the well-known Nyquist citerion for testing closed-loop
stability in terms of the open-loop frequency response locus to the class of
systems under consideration which is gained by applying Cauchy's argument

particularly suitable to represent a set supporting approximate membership

mainly depends on query overhead, space requirements and false positives. The
aim of this paper is to focus on false positives. Inspired by the recent
application of the BF in a novel multicast forwarding fabric for information
centric networks, this paper proposes the yes-no BF, a new way of representing
a set, based on the BF, but with significantly lower false positives and no
false negatives. Although it requires slightly more processing at the stage of
its formation, it offers the same processing requirements for membership

(Class 0) on scales of less than 300 AU is still poorly constrained.
Determining this is crucial for understanding the physical and chemical
evolution from cores to disks. In this study two models of the emission, a
Gaussian disk intensity distribution and a parametrized power-law disk model,
are fitted to sub-arcsecond resolution interferometric continuum observations
of five Class 0 sources, including one source with a confirmed Keplerian disk.
For reference, a spherically symmetric single power-law envelope is fitted to
the larger scale ($\sim$1000 AU) emission and investigated further for one of
the sources on smaller scales. A thin disk model can approximate the emission
and physical structure in the inner few 100 AU scales of the studied
deeply-embedded low-mass protostars and paves the way for analysis of a larger
sample with ALMA. While the disk radii agree with previous estimates the masses
are different for some of the sources studied. Assuming a typical temperature
distribution, the fractional amount of mass in the disk above 100 K varies in
between 7% to 30%. Kinematic data are needed to determine the presence of any
Keplerian disk. Using previous observations of p-H$_2^{18}$O, we estimate the
relative gas phase water abundances roughly an order of magnitude higher than
previously inferred when both warm and cold H$_2$ was used as reference. A
spherically symmetric single power-law envelope model fails to simultaneously

First, we define the concept of locality in two neighborhood systems, namely,
the spatial and functional neighborhoods. Then, we construct spatially and
functionally local meshes around each voxel, called seed voxel, by connecting
it either to its spatial or functional p-nearest neighbors. The mesh formed
around a voxel is a directed sub-graph with a star topology, where the
direction of the edges is taken towards the seed voxel at the center of the
mesh. We represent the time series recorded at each seed voxel in terms of
linear combination of the time series of its p-nearest neighbors in the mesh.
The relationships between a seed voxel and its neighbors are represented by the
edge weights of each mesh, and are estimated by solving a linear regression
equation. The estimated mesh edge weights lead to a better representation of
information in the brain for encoding and decoding of the cognitive tasks. We
test our model on a visual object recognition and emotional memory retrieval

  Evaluation of the Effects of Data Pre-processing","Master's thesis, July 2013",,,,"q-bio.NC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Resting state functional connectivity estimates from MRI measures has become
a promising tool to characterize human brain networks. There are, however,
limitations in the method since several sources of errors have been seen to
significantly affect the final estimates. This has lead to a great interest in
the field to do systematic investigations that help determine the most reliable
and robust strategies to perform functional connectivity analysis. In the
present study, we examine the influence of two aspects of data pre- processing
in resting state functional connectivity analysis: the effect of criteria used
to select nodes in the default mode network (DMN) for the computation of
connectivity, and the effect of using or not physiological noise correction.
Three different strategies of region of interest (ROI) selection were compared
to define DMN node coordinates: (1) ROIs centered on atlas-based coordinates,
(2) ROIs based on the result of group independent component analysis, and (3)
ROIs based on the estimated DMN of each individual. The study was done using
data of 15 healthy volunteers, which had resting state data available from a
separate project. We found that both effects, ROI selection criteria for DMN
nodes and physiological noise correction, have significant effects on the

potential progenitors of type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia). Recent hydrodynamical
simulations showed that the less massive (secondary) WD violently accretes onto
the more massive (primary) one, carbon detonation occurs, the detonation wave
propagates through the primary, and the primary finally explodes as a
sub-Chandrasekhar mass SN Ia. Such an explosion mechanism is called the violent
merger scenario. Based on the smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) simulations
of merging CO WDs, we derived more stringent critical mass ratio (qcr) leading
to the violent merger scenario than the previous results. We conclude that this
difference mainly comes from the differences in the initial condition,
synchronously spinning of WDs or not. Using our new results, we estimated the
brightness distribution of SNe Ia in the violent merger scenario and compared
it with previous studies. We found that our new qcr does not significantly
affect the brightness distribution. We present the direct outcome immediately
following CO WD mergers for various primary masses and mass ratios. We also
discussed the final fate of the central system of the bipolar planetary nebula
Henize 2-428, which was recently suggested to be a double CO WD system whose
total mass exceeds the Chandrasekhar-limiting mass, merging within the Hubble
time. Even considering the uncertainties in the proposed binary parameters, we
concluded that the final fate of this system is almost certainly a

structures and relationships hidden in data. Generally, the critical purpose of
graph-oriented learning algorithms is to construct an informative graph for
image clustering and classification tasks. In addition to the classical
$K$-nearest-neighbor and $r$-neighborhood methods for graph construction,
$l_1$-graph and its variants are emerging methods for finding the neighboring
samples of a center datum, where the corresponding ingoing edge weights are
simultaneously derived by the sparse reconstruction coefficients of the
remaining samples. However, the pair-wise links of $l_1$-graph are not capable
of capturing the high order relationships between the center datum and its
prominent data in sparse reconstruction. Meanwhile, from the perspective of
variable selection, the $l_1$ norm sparse constraint, regarded as a LASSO
model, tends to select only one datum from a group of data that are highly
correlated and ignore the others. To simultaneously cope with these drawbacks,
we propose a new elastic net hypergraph learning model, which consists of two
steps. In the first step, the Robust Matrix Elastic Net model is constructed to
find the canonically related samples in a somewhat greedy way, achieving the
grouping effect by adding the $l_2$ penalty to the $l_1$ constraint. In the
second step, hypergraph is used to represent the high order relationships
between each datum and its prominent samples by regarding them as a hyperedge.
Subsequently, hypergraph Laplacian matrix is constructed for further analysis.
New hypergraph learning algorithms, including unsupervised clustering and
multi-class semi-supervised classification, are then derived. Extensive
experiments on face and handwriting databases demonstrate the effectiveness of
the proposed method.

the Ni$_2$VAl Heusler compound is presented. The electron-phonon coupling
constant of $\lambda_{ep}$ = 0.68 is obtained, which leads to a superconducting
transition temperature of T$_c$ = $\sim$4 $K$ (assuming a Coulomb
pseudopotential $\mu^*$ = 0.13), which is a relatively high transition
temperature for Ni based Heusler alloys. The electronic density of states
reveals a significant hybridization between Ni-$eg$ and V-$t_{2g}$ states
around the Fermi level. The Fermi surface, consisting of two electron pockets
around the X-points of the Brillouin zone, exhibits nesting and leads to a Kohn
anomaly of the phonon dispersion relation for the transverse acoustic mode TA2
along the (1,1,0) direction, which is furthermore found to soften with
pressure. As a consequence, T$_c$ and $\lambda_{ep}$ vary non-monotonically
under pressure. The calculations are compared to similar calculations performed
for the Ni$_2$NbX (X = Al, Ga and Sn) Heusler alloys, which experimentally have
been identified as superconductors. The experimental trend in T$_c$ is well
reproduced, and reasonable quantitative agreement is obtained. The calculated
T$_c$ of Ni$_2$VAl is larger than either calculated and observed T$_c$s of any
of the Nb compounds. The Fermi surfaces of Ni$_2$NbAl and Ni$_2$NbGa consist of
only a single electron pocket around the X point, however under compression
second electron pocket similar to that of Ni2VAl emerges only in Ni2NbAl and
the Tc increases non monotonically in all the compounds. Fermi surface nesting
and associated Kohn anomalies are a common feature of all four compounds,
albeit weakest in Ni$_2$VAl.

probe the internal rotation profile of low-mass (~1.1-1.5 Msun) subgiant and
red giant stars. Under the assumption of local angular momentum conservation,
the core contraction and envelope expansion occurring at the end of the main
sequence would result in a much larger internal differential rotation than
observed. This suggests that angular momentum redistribution must be taking
place in the interior of these stars. Aims. We investigate the physical nature
of the angular momentum redistribution mechanisms operating in stellar
interiors by constraining the efficiency of post-main sequence rotational
coupling. Methods. We model the rotational evolution of a 1.25 Msun star using
the Yale Rotational stellar Evolution Code. Our models take into account the
magnetic wind braking occurring at the surface of the star and the angular
momentum transport in the interior, with an efficiency dependent on the degree
of internal differential rotation. Results. We find that models including a
dependence of the angular momentum transport efficiency on the radial
rotational shear reproduce very well the observations. The best fit of the data
is obtained with an angular momentum transport coefficient scaling with the
ratio of the rotation rate of the radiative interior over that of the
convective envelope of the star as a power law of exponent ~3. This scaling is
consistent with the predictions of recent numerical simulations of the
Azimuthal Magneto-Rotational Instability. Conclusions. We show that an angular
momentum transport process whose efficiency varies during the stellar evolution
through a dependence on the level of internal differential rotation is required
to explain the observed post-main sequence rotational evolution of low-mass
stars.

valency. Despite this, 3+ or mixed 3+/2+ valency of iron ions in ZnO was
reported previously. Several contradictory mechanisms have been put forward for
explanation of this fact so far. Here, we analyze Fe valency in ZnO by
complementary theoretical and experimental studies. Our calculations within the
generalized gradient approximation (GGA+U) indicate that the Fe ion is a
relatively shallow donor. Its stable charge state is Fe2+ in ideal ZnO,
however, the high energy of the (+/0) transition level enhances the
compensation of Fe2+ to Fe3+ by non-intentional acceptors in real samples.
Using several experimental methods like electron paramagnetic resonance,
magnetometry, conductivity, excitonic magnetic circular dichroism and
magneto-photoluminescence we confirm the 3+ valency of the iron ions in
polycrystalline (Zn,Fe)O films with the Fe content attaining 0.2%.We find a
predicted increase of n-type conductivity upon the Fe doping with the Fe donor
ionization energy of 0.25 +/- 0.02 eV consistent with the results of
theoretical considerations. Moreover, our magnetooptical measurements confirm
the calculated non-vanishing s,p-d exchange interaction between band carriers
and localized magnetic moments of the Fe3+ ions in the ZnO, being so far an
unsettled issue.

on the mass fraction of micrometre-sized dust grains and on their chemical
composition. A larger abundance of micrometre-sized grains leads to an overall
heating of the disc, so that the water ice line moves further away from the
star. An increase in the water fraction inside the disc, maintaining a fixed
dust abundance, increases the temperature in the icy regions of the disc and
lowers the temperature in the inner regions. Discs with a larger silicate
fraction have the opposite effect. Here we explore the consequence of the dust
composition and abundance for the formation and migration of planets. We find
that discs with low water content can only sustain outwards migration for
planets up to 4 Earth masses, while outwards migration in discs with a larger
water content persists up to 8 Earth masses in the late stages of the disc
evolution. Icy planetary cores that do not reach run-away gas accretion can
thus migrate to orbits close to the host star if the water abundance is low.
Our results imply that hot and warm super-Earths found in exoplanet surveys
could have formed beyond the ice line and thus contain a significant fraction
in water. These water-rich super-Earths should orbit primarily around stars
with a low oxygen abundance, where a low oxygen abundance is caused by either a
low water-to-silicate ratio or by overall low metallicity.

magnetic anisotropy in technologically important materials is highly desirable.
Here we show that magnetic anisotropy of epitaxial thin-films of half-metallic
ferromagnet La$_{0.7}$Sr$_{0.3}$MnO$_{3}$ (LSMO) is determined by the proximity
to thermodynamic equilibrium conditions during growth. We performed a series of
X-ray diffraction and ferromagnetic resonance (FMR) experiments in two
different sets of samples: the first corresponds to LSMO thin-films deposited
under tensile strain on (001) SrTiO$_{3}$ by Pulsed Laser Deposition (PLD; far
from thermodynamic equilibrium); the second were deposited by a slow Chemical
Solution Deposition (CSD) method, under quasi-equilibrium conditions. Thin
films prepared by PLD show a in-plane cubic anisotropy with an overimposed
uniaxial term. A large anisotropy constant perpendicular to the film plane was
also observed in these films. However, the uniaxial anisotropy is completely
suppressed in the CSD films. The out of plane anisotropy is also reduced,
resulting in a much stronger in plane cubic anisotropy in the chemically
synthesized films. This change is due to a different rotation pattern of
MnO$_{6}$ octahedra to accomodate epitaxial strain, which depends not only on
the amount of tensile stress imposed by the STO substrate, but also on the
growth conditions. Our results demonstrate that the nature and magnitude of the
magnetic anisotropy in LSMO can be tuned by the thermodynamic parameters during
thin-film deposition.

determined consistently with the same sample selection, metallicity tracer, and
methodology over the wide redshift range probed by the survey. We find good
agreement with long-slit surveys in the literature, except for the low-mass
slope of the relation at z~2.3, where this sample is less biased than previous
samples based on optical spectroscopic redshifts. In this regime we measure a
steeper slope than some literature results. Excluding the AGN contribution from
the MZR reduces sensitivity at the high mass end, but produces otherwise
consistent results. There is no significant dependence of the [NII]/Ha ratio on
SFR or environment at fixed redshift and stellar mass. The IFU data allow
spatially resolved measurements of [NII]/Ha, from which we can infer abundance
gradients for 180 galaxies, thus tripling the current sample in the literature.
The observed gradients are on average flat, with only 15 gradients
statistically offset from zero at >3sigma. We have modelled the effect of
beam-smearing, assuming a smooth intrinsic radial gradient and known seeing,
inclination and effective radius for each galaxy. Our seeing-limited
observations can recover up to 70% of the intrinsic gradient for the largest,
face-on disks, but only 30% for the smaller, more inclined galaxies. We do not
find significant trends between observed or corrected gradients and any stellar

existing studies with much smaller sample sizes. In cosmological simulations,
strong feedback is generally required to produce flat gradients at high

unidirectional circulation. This motion is reproduced in simulations of
discrete swimmers that reveal the crucial role that bacteria-driven fluid flows
play in the dynamics. In particular, cells close to the channel wall produce
strong flows which advect cells in the bulk against their swimming direction.
We examine in detail the transition from a disordered state to persistent

Global Telescope (LCOGT) Network and the IAC80 telescope. We combine our 15 new

available transit light curves of this exoplanet. By extending the time span of
the monitoring of the transits to more than $5~yr$, and by analyzing the
individual mid-times of 72 transits, we study the proposed shortening of the
orbital period of WASP-43b. We estimate that the times of transit are
well-matched by our updated ephemeris equation, using a constant orbital
period. We estimate an orbital period change rate no larger than $\dot{P}=-0.02
\pm 6.6~ms~yr^{-1}$, which is fully consistent with a constant period. Based on
the timing analysis, we discard stellar tidal dissipation factors
$Q_{*}<10^{5}$. In addition, with the modelling of the transits we update the
system parameters: $a/Rs=4.867(23)$, $i=82.11(10)^{\circ}$ and
$R_p/R_s=0.15942(41)$, noticing a difference in the relative size of the planet

astrophysical pulses. Such pulses are commonly detected from Galactic pulsars
and rotating radio transients (RRATs), which are neutron stars with sporadic
radio emission. More recently, isolated, highly dispersed pulses dubbed fast
radio bursts (FRBs) have been identified as the potential signature of an
extragalactic cataclysmic radio source distinct from pulsars and RRATs.
Clusterrank helped us discover 14 pulsars and 8 RRATs in data from the Arecibo
327 MHz Drift Pulsar Survey (AO327). The new RRATs have DMs in the range $23.5
- 86.6$ pc cm$^{-3}$ and periods in the range $0.172 - 3.901$ s. The new
pulsars have DMs in the range $23.6 - 133.3$ pc cm$^{-3}$ and periods in the
range $1.249 - 5.012$ s, and include two nullers and a mode-switching object.
We estimate an upper limit on the all-sky FRB rate of $10^5$ day$^{-1}$ for
bursts with a width of 10 ms and flux density $\gtrsim 83$ mJy. The DMs of all
new discoveries are consistent with a Galactic origin. In comparing statistics
of the new RRATs with sources from the RRATalog, we find that both sets are
drawn from the same period distribution. In contrast, we find that the period
distribution of the new pulsars is different from the period distributions of
canonical pulsars in the ATNF catalog or pulsars found in AO327 data by a
periodicity search. This indicates that Clusterrank is a powerful complement to
periodicity searches and uncovers a subset of the pulsar population that has so
far been underrepresented in survey results and therefore in Galactic pulsar
population models.

generalized parametric excitation described by a superposition of $N$ cosines
with different amplitudes and frequencies, based on a simple stability
condition that does not require any use of Lyapunov exponent, for example. Our
analysis is separated in 3 different cases: $N=1$, $N=2$, and $N$ very large.
Our results were obtained via numerical simulations by fourth-order Runge Kutta
integration of the non-linear equations. We also calculate the effective
potential also for $N>2$. We show then that numerical integrations recover a
wider region of stability that are not captured by the (approximated)
analytical method. We also analyze stochastic stabilization here: firstly, we
look the effects of external noise in the stability diagram by enlarging the
variance, and secondly, when $N$ is large, we rescale the amplitude by showing
that the diagrams for time survival of the inverted pendulum resembles the
exact case for $N=1$. Finally, we find numerically the optimal number of
cosines corresponding to the maximal survival probability of the pendulum.

states, such as cancer, is a large and extremely complex task. Indeed, these
systems involve many parts and processes but are studied piecewise and their
literatures and data are consequently fragmented, distributed and sometimes--at
least apparently--inconsistent. This makes it extremely difficult to build
significant explanatory models with the result that effects in these systems
that are brought about by many interacting factors are poorly understood.
  The rule-based approach to modelling has shown some promise for the
representation of the highly combinatorial systems typically found in
signalling where many of the proteins are composed of multiple binding domains,
capable of simultaneous interactions, and/or peptide motifs controlled by
post-translational modifications. However, the rule-based approach requires
highly detailed information about the precise conditions for each and every
interaction which is rarely available from any one single source. Rather, these
conditions must be painstakingly inferred and curated, by hand, from
information contained in many papers--each of which contains only part of the
story.
  In this paper, we introduce a graph-based meta-model, attuned to the
representation of cellular signalling networks, which aims to ease this massive
cognitive burden on the rule-based curation process. This meta-model is a
generalization of that used by Kappa and BNGL which allows for the flexible
representation of knowledge at various levels of granularity. In particular, it
allows us to deal with information which has either too little, or too much,
detail with respect to the strict rule-based meta-model. Our approach provides
a basis for the gradual aggregation of fragmented biological knowledge
extracted from the literature into an instance of the meta-model from which we
can define an automated translation into executable Kappa programs.

of its most serious malfunctions is the blackout, a catastrophic event that may
disrupt a substantial portion of the system, playing havoc to human life and
causing great economic losses. Thus, understanding the mechanisms leading to
blackouts and creating a reliable and resilient power grid has been a major
issue, attracting the attention of scientists, engineers and stakeholders. In
this paper, we study the blackout problem in power grids by considering a
practical phase-oscillator model. This model allows one to simultaneously
consider different types of power sources (e.g., traditional AC power plants
and renewable power sources connected by DC/AC inverters) and different types
of loads (e.g., consumers connected to distribution networks and consumers
directly connected to power plants). We propose two new control strategies
based on our model, one for traditional power grids, and another one for smart
grids. The control strategies show the efficient function of the fast-response
energy storage systems in preventing and predicting blackouts in smart grids.
This work provides innovative ideas which help us to build up a robuster and
more economic smart power system.
