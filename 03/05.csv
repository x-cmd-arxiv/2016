effect of these correction terms on the first law of thermodynamics. Finally,

mixing time is related to a geometric parameter called conductance which is a
measure of edge-expansion. Bounds on conductance are typically obtained by a
technique called ""canonical paths"" where the idea is to find a set of paths,
one between every source-destination pair, such that no edge is heavily
congested. However, the canonical paths approach cannot always show rapid
mixing of a rapidly mixing chain. This drawback disappears if we allow the flow
between a pair of states to be spread along multiple paths. We prove that for a
large class of Markov chains canonical paths does capture rapid mixing.
Allowing multiple paths to route the flow still does help a great deal in
proofs, as illustrated by a result of Morris & Sinclair (FOCS'99) on the rapid
mixing of a Markov chain for sampling 0/1 knapsack solutions.
  A different approach to prove rapid mixing is ""Coupling"". Path Coupling is a
variant discovered by Bubley & Dyer (FOCS'97) that often tremendously reduces
the complexity of designing good Couplings. We present several applications of
Path Coupling in proofs of rapid mixing. These invariably lead to much better
bounds on mixing time than known using conductance, and moreover Coupling based
proofs are typically simpler. This motivates the question of whether Coupling
can be made to work whenever the chain is rapidly mixing. This question was
answered in the negative by Kumar & Ramesh (FOCS'99), who showed that no
Coupling strategy can prove the rapid mixing of the Jerrum-Sinclair chain for
sampling perfect and near-perfect matchings.

other participants, and specifically about the preferences of other
participants. In this work, we model an extreme case of incomplete information,
which we term games with type ambiguity, where a participant lacks even
information enabling him to form a belief on the preferences of others. Under
type ambiguity, one cannot analyze the scenario using the commonly used
Bayesian framework, and therefore he needs to model the participants using a
different decision model.
  In this work, we present the ${\rm MINthenMAX}$ decision model under
ambiguity. This model is a refinement of Wald's MiniMax principle, which we
show to be too coarse for games with type ambiguity. We characterize ${\rm
MINthenMAX}$ as the finest refinement of the MiniMax principle that satisfies
three properties we claim are necessary for games with type ambiguity. This
prior-less approach we present her also follows the common practice in computer
science of worst-case analysis.
  Finally, we define and analyze the corresponding equilibrium concept assuming
all players follow ${\rm MINthenMAX}$. We demonstrate this equilibrium by
applying it to two common economic scenarios: coordination games and bilateral
trade. We show that in both scenarios, an equilibrium in pure strategies always
exists and we analyze the equilibria.

narrow line Seyfert 1 (NLSy1) galaxy SBS 0846+513 ($z=0.585$). This includes
multi-band flux variations, $\gamma$-ray spectral analysis, broad band spectral
energy distribution (SED) modeling, and intranight optical variability (INOV)
observations carried over 6 nights between 2012 November and 2013 March using
the 2 m Himalayan Chandra Telescope and the 1.3 m telescope at Devasthal.
Multiple episodes of flaring activity are seen in the $\gamma$-ray light curve
of the source which are also reflected in the observations at lower
frequencies. A statistically significant curvature is noticed in the seven
years averaged $\gamma$-ray spectrum, thus indicating its similarity with
powerful flat spectrum radio quasars (FSRQs). Modeling the SEDs with a one zone
leptonic emission model hints the optical-UV spectrum to be dominated by
synchrotron radiation, whereas, inverse Compton scattering of broad line region
photons reproduces the $\gamma$-ray part of the SEDs. The source was found to
be variable on all the six nights of optical observations with a variation of
$\sim$0.3 magnitude within a single night, coinciding with a high $\gamma$-ray
activity state. The observed large amplitude INOV clearly indicates the
presence of a closely aligned beamed relativistic jet in SBS 0846+513. Our
broadband study supports the recent claims in literature that $\gamma$-ray
emitting NLSy1 galaxies are similar to blazars and constitute the low black
hole mass counterparts to FSRQs.

top of DART -- a run-time system with an abstracted tier above existing

  In order to facilitate the application development process for exploiting the
hierarchical organization of HPC machines, DART allows to reorder the placement
of the computational units. In this paper we present an automatic, hierarchical
units mapping technique (using a similar approach to the Hilbert curve
transformation) to reorder the placement of DART units on the Cray XC40 machine

into the account the topology of allocated compute nodes, we perform latency
benchmark for a 3D stencil code. The technique of units mapping is generic and
can be be adopted in other DART communication substrates and on other hardware
platforms.

review papers on cosmology is, in general, derived for world models based on
Robertson-Walker line element where homogeneity and isotropy of the universe --
\`a la cosmological principle -- is assumed to begin with and is guaranteed for
all epochs. Actually what all happens in that scenario is that in such a
universe, whose evolutionary behaviour is described by a single scale factor,
which may be time dependent but is otherwise independent of spatial
coordinates, the light signals in a finite time might not be covering all the
available space. Further, the flatness problem, as it is posed, is not even
falsifiable. The usual argument offered in the literature is that the present
density of the universe is very close to the critical density value and that
the universe must be flat since otherwise in past at $\sim10^{-35}$ second
(near the epoch of inflation) there will be extremely low departures of density
from the critical density value (of the order $\sim10^{-53}$), requiring a sort
of fine tuning. We show that even if the present value of the density parameter
were very different, still at $10^{-35}$ second it would differ from unity by
the same fraction. Thus a use of fine tuning argument to promote $k = 0$ model
amounts to {\em a priori} rejection of all models with $k \ne 0$. Without
casting any aspersions on the inflationary theory, which after all is the most
promising paradigm to explain the pattern of anisotropies observed in the
cosmic microwave background, we argue that one cannot use homogeneity and
flatness in support of inflation.

only the group members are able to receive the messages. The main problem in
the solution using symmetric key is heavy re-keying cost. To reduce re-keying
cost tree based architecture is used. But it requires extra overhead to balance
the key- tree in order to achieve logarithmic re-keying cost. The main
challenging issue in dynamic and secure multimedia multicast communication is
to design a centralized group key management scheme with minimal computational,
communicational and storages complexities without breaching security issues.
Several authors have proposed different centralized group key management
schemes, wherein one of them proposes reducing communicational complexity but
increases computational and storage costs however another proposes decreasing
the computational and storage costs which eventually breaches forward and
backward secrecy. In this paper we propose a comparatively more efficient
centralized group key management scheme that not only minimize the
computational, communicational and storages complexities but also maintaining
the security at the optimal level. The message encryptions and decryptions
costs are also minimized. Further, we also provide an extended multicast
scheme, in which the several requests towards leaving or joining the group can
be done by large number of members simultaneously. In order to obtain better
performance of multicast encryption, the symmetric-key and asymmetric-key
cryptosystems may be combined.

20. In the energy range of 0.1-300 GeV, the highest flux measured by {\it
Fermi}-Large Area Telescope is (3.90 $\pm$ 1.52) $\times$ 10$^{-6}$ ph
cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$, which is the highest $\gamma$-ray flux ever detected from
this object. The associated spectral shape is soft ($\Gamma_{0.1-300~{\rm
GeV}}=2.57\pm0.17$) and this corresponds to an isotropic $\gamma$-ray
luminosity of (1.2 $\pm$ 0.6) $\times$ 10$^{48}$ erg s$^{-1}$. We generate the
broadband spectral energy distribution (SED) during the GeV flare and reproduce
it using a one zone leptonic emission model. The optical-UV spectrum can be
explained by a combination of synchrotron and the accretion disk emission,
whereas, the X-ray to $\gamma$-ray SED can be satisfactorily reproduced by
inverse-Compton scattering of thermal photons originated from the torus. The
derived SED parameters hint for the increase in the bulk Lorentz factor as a
major cause of the flare and the location of the emission region is estimated
as outside the broad line region but still inside torus. A comparison of the
GeV flaring SED of PKS 1502+036 with that of two other $\gamma$-NLSy1 galaxies,
namely, 1H 0323+342 ($z=0.061$) and PMN J0948+0022 ($z=0.585$), and also with
FSRQ 3C 279 ($z=0.536$) has led to the conclusion that the GeV flaring SEDs of
$\gamma$-NLSy1 galaxies resemble with FSRQs and a major fraction of their
bolometric luminosity is emitted at $\gamma$-ray energies.

can be challenging, especially in deposition systems where, in addition to the
multiple competing processes occurring simultaneously, the solid interacts with
its atmosphere. In this work, we develop a model for the growth of a thin solid
film where species from the atmosphere adsorb, diffuse, and react with the
film. The model is mesoscale and describes an entire film with thickness on the
order of microns. Because it is stochastic, the model allows us to examine
inhomogeneities and agglomerations that would be impossible to characterize
with deterministic methods. We demonstrate the modeling approach with the
example of chalcopyrite Cu(InGa)(SeS)$_2$ thin film growth via precursor
reaction, which is a common industrial method for fabricating thin film
photovoltaic modules. The model is used to understand how and why through-film
variation in the composition of Cu(InGa)(SeS)$_2$ thin films arises and
persists. We believe that the model will be valuable as an effective

the scaling relation for faint galaxies. The overall LF exhibits a bimodal
behavior with a distinct dip at $r\sim18.5$ mag ($M_r\sim-17.8$ mag), which is
more appropriately described by a two-component function. The shape of the LF
strongly depends on the cluster-centric distance and on the local galaxy
density. The LF of galaxies in the outer, low-density region exhibits a steeper
slope and more prominent dip compared with that of counterparts in the inner,
high-density region. We found evidence for a substructure in the projected
galaxy distribution in which several overdense regions in the Abell 119 cluster
appear to be closely associated with the surrounding, possible filamentary
structure. The combined LF of the overdense regions exhibits a two-component
function with a distinct dip, while the LF of the central region is well
described by a single Schechter function. We suggest that, in the context of
the hierarchical cluster formation scenario, the observed overdense regions are
the relics of galaxy groups, retaining their two-component LFs with a dip,
which acquired their shapes through galaxy merging process in group
environments, before they fall into a cluster.

correcting biases in the analysis of SNIa to infer cosmological parameters.
Large scale Monte Carlo simulations include a thorough treatment of observation
history, measurement noise, intrinsic scatter models and selection effects. In
this paper, we improve simulations with a robust technique to evaluate the
underlying populations of SNIa color and stretch that correlate with
luminosity. In typical analyses, the standardized SNIa brightness is determined
from linear `Tripp' relations between the light curve color and luminosity and
between stretch and luminosity. However, this solution produces Hubble residual
biases because intrinsic scatter and measurement noise result in measured color
and stretch values that do not follow the Tripp relation. We find a $10\sigma$
bias (up to 0.3 mag) in Hubble residuals versus color and $5\sigma$ bias (up to
0.2 mag) in Hubble residuals versus stretch in a joint sample of 920
spectroscopically confirmed SNIa from PS1, SNLS, SDSS and several low-z
surveys. After we determine the underlying color and stretch distributions, we
use simulations to predict and correct the biases in the data. We show that
removing these biases has a small impact on the low-z sample, but reduces the
intrinsic scatter $\sigma_{\textrm{int}}$ from $0.101$ to $0.083$ in the
combined PS1, SNLS and SDSS sample. Past estimates of the underlying
populations were too broad, leading to a small bias in the equation-of-state of

large-scale PDE-constrained inverse problems with high-dimensional data. The
purpose of this paper is to offer a theory-based framework for random
projections in this inverse problem setting. The stochastic approximation to
the misfit is analyzed using random projection theory. By expanding beyond mean
estimator convergence, a practical characterization of randomized misfit
convergence can be achieved. The theoretical results developed hold with any
valid random projection in the literature. The class of feasible distributions
is broad yet simple to characterize compared to previous stochastic misfit
methods. This class includes very sparse random projections which provide
additional computational benefit. A different proof for a variant of the
Johnson-Lindenstrauss lemma is also provided. This leads to a different
intuition for the $O(\epsilon^{-2})$ factor in bounds for Johnson-Lindenstrauss
results. The main contribution of this paper is a theoretical result showing
the method guarantees a valid solution for small reduced misfit dimensions. The
interplay between Johnson-Lindenstrauss theory and Morozov's discrepancy
principle is shown to be essential to the result. The computational cost
savings for large-scale PDE-constrained problems with high- dimensional data is
discussed. Numerical verification of the developed theory is presented for
model problems of estimating a distributed parameter in an elliptic partial
differential equation. Results with different random projections are presented
to demonstrate the viability and accuracy of the proposed approach.

Universe is in discordance with the observed Li abundances in warm Population

been suggested that this discrepancy can be alleviated if the stars observed
today had undergone photospheric depletion of lithium. The cause of this
depletion is investigated by accurately tracing the behaviour of the lithium
abundances as a function of effective temperature. Globular clusters are ideal
laboratories for such an abundance analysis as the relative stellar parameters
of their stars can be precisely determined. We performed a homogeneous chemical
abundance analysis of 144 stars in the metal-poor globular cluster M30, ranging
from the cluster turnoff point to the tip of the red giant branch. NLTE
abundances for Li, Ca, and Fe were derived where possible. Stellar parameters
were derived by matching isochrones to the observed V vs V-I colour-magnitude
diagram. Independent effective temperatures were obtained from automated
profile fitting of the Balmer lines and by applying colour-T_eff calibrations
to the broadband photometry. Li abundances of the turnoff and early subgiant
stars form a thin plateau that is broken off abruptly in the middle of the SGB
as a result of the onset of Li dilution caused by the first dredge-up.
Abundance trends with effective temperature for Fe and Ca are observed and
compared to predictions from stellar structure models including atomic
diffusion and ad hoc additional mixing below the surface convection zone. The
comparison shows that the stars in M30 are affected by atomic diffusion and
additional mixing. After applying a conservative correction for atomic
diffusion, we find an initial Li abundance of A(Li) = $2.48\pm0.10$ for the
globular cluster M30.

general geometrodynamical symmetries compatible with a reduced physical

Demanding locality for an action compatible with these principles determines
the sort of terms one can add, both for the purely gravitational part as well
as matter couplings. The symmetries guarantee that there are two gravitational
propagating physical degrees of freedom (and no explicit
refoliation-invariance). The simplest such system has a geometric
interpretation as a geodesic model in infinite dimensional conformal
superspace. An approximate solution to the equations of motion corresponds to a
static Bianchi IX spatial ansatz. The unique coupling to electromagnetism
forces its propagation equations to be hyperbolic, enabling us to \""build"" a
standard space-time causal structure. There are, however, deviations from the
standard Maxwell equations when space-time anisotropies become too large.
Regarding quantization, with the geometric interpretation and the lack of
refoliation invariance, the path integral treatment of the symmetries becomes
much less involved than the similar approaches to GR. The symmetries form an
(infinite-dimensional) Lie algebra, and no BFV treatment is necessary. We find
that the propagator around the flat solution has up to 6-th order spatial
derivatives, giving it plausible regularization properties as in

droplets could have formed via the segregation of molecules from complex
mixtures by phase separation. These droplets could have provided chemical
reaction centers. However, whether these droplets could divide and propagate is
unclear. Here we examine the behavior of droplets in systems that are
maintained away from thermodynamic equilibrium by an external supply of energy.
In these systems, droplets grow by the addition of droplet material generated
by chemical reactions. Surprisingly, we find that chemically driven droplet
growth can lead to shape instabilities that trigger the division of droplets
into two smaller daughters. Therefore, chemically active droplets can exhibit
cycles of growth and division that resemble the proliferation of living cells.
Dividing active droplets could serve as a model for prebiotic protocells, where
chemical reactions in the droplet play the role of a prebiotic metabolism.

of quantum gravity, I suggest that the main one concerns a quantization of the
principle of relative simultaneity. This leads me to a distinction between time
and space, to a further degree than that present in the canonical approach to
general relativity. With this distinction, one can make sense of superpositions
as interference between alternative paths in the relational configuration space
of the entire Universe. But the full use of relationalism brings us to a
timeless picture of Nature, as it does in the canonical approach (which
culminates in the Wheeler-DeWitt equation). After a discussion of Parmenides
and the Eleatics' rejection of time, I show that there is middle ground between
their view of absolute timelessness and a view of physics taking place in
timeless configuration space. In this middle ground, even though change does
not fundamentally exist, the illusion of change can be recovered in a way not
permitted by Parmenides. It is recovered through a particular density
distribution over configuration space which gives rise to 'records'.
Incidentally, this distribution seems to have the potential to dissolve further
aspects of the measurement problem that can still be argued to haunt the
application of decoherence to Many-Worlds quantum mechanics. I end with a
discussion indicating that the conflict between the conclusions of this paper
and our view of the continuity of the self may still intuitively bother us.
Nonetheless, those conclusions should be no more challenging to our intuition
than Derek Parfit's thought experiments on the subject.

employing several models: (i) a micromagnetic model, which takes into account
the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (DMI) besides the spin stiffness and the
magnetic anisotropy energy, and (ii) the Fert-Levy model of the DMI for diluted
magnetic impurities in metals. Due to the step-edge geometry, the direction of
the Dzyaloshinskii vector (D-vector) is not predetermined by symmetry and
points in an off-symmetry direction. For the Mn chain we predict a long-period
cycloidal spin-spiral ground state of unique rotational sense on top of an
otherwise atomic-scale antiferromagnetic phase. The spins rotate in a plane
that is tilted relative to the Pt surface by $62^\circ$ towards the upper step
of the surface. The Fe and Co chains show a ferromagnetic ground state since
the DMI is too weak to overcome their respective magnetic anisotropy barriers.
Beyond the discussion of the monatomic chains we provide general expressions
relating ab-initio results to realistic model parameters that occur in a
spin-lattice or in a micromagnetic model. We prove that a planar homogeneous
spiral of classical spins with a given wave vector rotating in a plane whose
normal is parallel to the D-vector is an exact stationary state solution of a
spin-lattice model for a periodic solid that includes Heisenberg exchange and
DMI. The validity of the Fert-Levy model for the evaluation of micromagnetic

have found that the presence of oscillatory behavior is sensitive to the DWF
parameters $a_5$, $b_5$, $c_5$ and DW height $M$. To minimize oscillations, our
results suggest that one should choose $M a_5<1$ for the Shamir and Bori\c{c}i

the mass composition of cosmic rays between 10^{17} eV and 10^{18} eV are
essential to understand whether this energy range is dominated by Galactic or
extragalactic sources. It has also been proposed that the astrophysical
neutrino signal comes from accelerators capable of producing cosmic rays of
these energies. Cosmic rays initiate cascades of secondary particles (air
showers) in the atmosphere and their masses are inferred from measurements of
the atmospheric depth of the shower maximum, Xmax, or the composition of shower
particles reaching the ground. Current measurements suffer from either low
precision, or a low duty cycle and a high energy threshold. Radio detection of
cosmic rays is a rapidly developing technique, suitable for determination of
Xmax with a duty cycle of in principle nearly 100%. The radiation is generated
by the separation of relativistic charged particles in the geomagnetic field
and a negative charge excess in the shower front. Here we report radio
measurements of Xmax with a mean precision of 16 g/cm^2 between
10^{17}-10^{17.5} eV. Because of the high resolution in $Xmax we can determine
the mass spectrum and find a mixed composition, containing a light mass
fraction of ~80%. Unless the extragalactic component becomes significant
already below 10^{17.5} eV, our measurements indicate an additional Galactic
component dominating at this energy range.

Nevertheless, they are generally complicated by the considerable orthographic

For example, a lexicon is used to generate all the potential lemma-tag pairs

Including flexion allows us to supplement the shear on small scales in order to
increase the sensitivity to substructures and the overall resolution of the
convergence map without relying on strong lensing constraints. In order to
preserve all available small scale information, we avoid any binning of the
irregularly sampled input shear and flexion fields and treat the mass-mapping
problem as a general ill-posed inverse problem, regularised using a robust
multi-scale wavelet sparsity prior. The resulting algorithm incorporates
redshift, reduced shear, and reduced flexion measurements for individual
galaxies and is made highly efficient by the use of fast Fourier estimators. We
test our reconstruction method on a set of realistic weak lensing simulations
corresponding to typical HST/ACS cluster observations and demonstrate our
ability to recover substructures with the inclusion of flexion which are lost
if only shear information is used. In particular, we can detect substructures
at the 15$^{\prime \prime}$ scale well outside of the critical region of the
clusters. In addition, flexion also helps to constrain the shape of the central
regions of the main dark matter halos. Our mass-mapping software, called

$f\lesssim100$ MHz, and radiation loss, which dominates for small aspect ratios
and $f\gtrsim100$ MHz. First we show that by embedding a nanobeam in a 1D
phononic crystal, it is possible to localize its flexural motion and shield it
against radiation loss. Using this method, we realize $f>100$ MHz modes with
$Q\sim 10^4$, consistent with internal loss and contrasting sharply with
unshielded beams of similar dimensions. We then study the $Q\cdot f$ products
of high-order modes of mm-long nanobeams. Taking advantage of the mode-shape
dependence of stress-induced `loss-dilution', we realize a $f\approx 4$ MHz
mode with $Q\cdot f\approx9\cdot 10^{12}$ Hz. Our results can extend room
temperature quantum coherent operation to ultra-low-mass 1D nanomechanical
oscillators.

750 GeV recently reported in the ATLAS and CMS experiments. Assuming that it is
a spinless boson, dubbed $\tilde s$, we consider it within a model containing
two weak scalar doublets having zero vacuum expectation values and a scalar
singlet in addition to the doublet responsible for breaking the electroweak

lightest one of which can play the role of dark matter and which participate
with the new doublet scalars in generating light neutrino masses radiatively.
We show that the model is consistent with all phenomenological constraints and
can yield a production cross section
$\sigma(pp\rightarrow\tilde{s}\rightarrow\gamma\gamma)$ of roughly the desired
size, mainly via the photon-fusion contribution, without involving extra
colored fermions or bosons. We also discuss other major decay modes of $\tilde

cosmic microwave background (CMB) photons due to Compton-scattering off free
electrons with non-zero bulk velocity --- probes the abundance and distribution
of baryons in the Universe. All kSZ measurements to date have explicitly
required spectroscopic redshifts. Here, we implement a novel estimator for the
kSZ -- large-scale structure cross-correlation based on projected fields: it
does not require redshift estimates for individual objects, allowing kSZ
measurements from large-scale imaging surveys. We apply this estimator to
cleaned CMB temperature maps constructed from Planck and Wilkinson Microwave
Anisotropy Probe data and a galaxy sample from the Wide-field Infrared Survey
Explorer (WISE). We measure the kSZ effect at 3.8-4.5$\sigma$ significance,
depending on the use of additional WISE galaxy bias constraints. We verify that
our measurements are robust to possible dust emission from the WISE galaxies.
Assuming the standard $\Lambda$CDM cosmology, we directly constrain $(
{f_{b}}/{0.158} ) ( {f_{\rm free}}/{1.0} ) = 1.48 \pm 0.19$ (statistical error
only) at redshift $z \approx 0.4$, where $f_{b}$ is the fraction of matter in
baryonic form and $f_{\rm free}$ is the free electron fraction. This is the
tightest kSZ-derived constraint reported to date on these parameters. The
consistency between the $f_{b}$ value found here and the values inferred from
analyses of the primordial CMB and Big Bang nucleosynthesis verifies that
baryons approximately trace the dark matter distribution down to $\sim$Mpc
scales. While our projected-field estimator is already competitive with other
kSZ approaches when applied to current datasets (because we are able to use the
full-sky WISE photometric survey), it will yield enormous signal-to-noise when
applied to upcoming high-resolution, multi-frequency CMB surveys.

quasi-steady,`gravito-turbulent' states in which cooling balances turbulent
viscous heating. However, numerical simulations show that gravito-turbulence
cannot be sustained beyond dynamical timescales when the cooling rate or
corresponding turbulent viscosity is too large. The result is disk
fragmentation. We motivate and quantify an interpretation of disk fragmentation
as the inability to maintain gravito-turbulence due to formal secondary
instabilities driven by: 1) cooling, which reduces pressure support; and/or 2)
viscosity, which reduces rotational support. We analyze the axisymmetric
gravitational stability of viscous, non-adiabatic accretion disks with internal
heating, external irradiation, and cooling in the shearing box approximation.
We consider parameterized cooling functions in 2D and 3D disks, as well as
radiative diffusion in 3D. We show that generally there is no critical cooling
rate/viscosity below which the disk is formally stable, although interesting
limits appear for unstable modes with lengthscales on the order of the disk
thickness. We apply this new linear theory to protoplanetary disks subject to
gravito-turbulence modeled as an effective viscosity, and cooling regulated by
dust opacity. We find that viscosity renders the disk beyond $\sim 60$AU
dynamically unstable on radial lengthscales a few times the local disk
thickness. This is coincident with the empirical condition for disk
fragmentation based on a maximum sustainable stress. We suggest turbulent
stresses can play an active role in realistic disk fragmentation by removing
rotational stabilization against self-gravity, and that the observed transition
in behavior from gravito-turbulent to fragmenting may reflect instability of
the gravito-turbulent state itself.

satellite luminosity function around Milky Way-mass simulated galaxies at
redshift zero. However, a more stringent test of these models is their ability
to simultaneously match the satellite luminosity functions of a range of host

faint (sub-Small Magellanic Cloud luminosity) satellites around hosts with
stellar masses 10.5$<\log_{10}$M$_*$/M$_\odot<11.5$ to an unprecedented

simulations show that the null hypothesis of being non-rotating GC systems
cannot be ruled out. In the case of VCC1861, the measured Vmax and the
simulations indicate that it is not rotating. In the case of VCC1528, the null
hypothesis can be marginally ruled out, thus, it might be rotating although
further confirmation is needed. In our analysis, we find that, in general, the
measured Vmax tends to be overestimated and the measured sigma_GC tends to be
underestimated by amounts that depend on the intrinsic Vmax/sigma_GC, the
number of observed GCs (N_GC), and the velocity uncertainties. The bias is
negligible when N_GC>~20. In those cases where a large N_GC is not available,
it is imperative to obtain data with small velocity uncertainties. For
instance, errors of <2km/s lead to Vmax<10km/s for a system that is

explore the observational signatures of GI in disks, using hydrodynamical and
Monte Carlo radiative transfer simulations to synthesize NIR scattered light

radii of hundreds of AUs, are local overdensities and have their photospheres
displaced to higher altitudes above the disk midplane, arms therefore scatter
more NIR light from their central stars than inter-arm regions, and are
detectable at distances up to 1 kpc by Gemini/GPI, VLT/SPHERE, and
Subaru/HiCIAO/SCExAO. By contrast, collapsed clumps formed by disk
fragmentation have such strong local gravitational fields that their scattering
photospheres are at lower altitudes, such fragments appear fainter than their
surroundings in NIR scattered light. Spiral arms and streamers recently imaged
in four FU Ori systems at NIR wavelengths resemble GI-induced structures and
support the interpretation that FUors are gravitationally unstable protostellar
disks. At mm wavelengths, both spirals and clumps appear brighter in thermal
emission than the ambient disk and can be detected by ALMA at distances up to

of gas dissipation towards lower redshifts and for more massive systems.
Early-type galaxies are smaller, more concentrated, have lower f_DM and steeper

All simulations, independent of the assumed feedback model, predict steeper
gamma_tot and lower f_DM at higher redshifts. While the latter is in agreement

which indicate constant or decreasing gamma_tot. This discrepancy is shown to
be artificial: the observed trends can be reproduced from the simulations using

quenches in two-band Dirac systems as natural venues to realize persistent Hall

relatively low velocity dispersions, compact groups mimic the conditions of
hierarchical galaxy assembly. Compact group galaxies are known to show a
bimodality in $Spitzer$ IRAC infrared colorspace: galaxies are preferentially
either quiescent with low specific star formation rates, or are prolifically
forming stars---galaxies with moderate levels of specific star formation are
rare. Previous $Spitzer$ IRAC studies identifying this ""canyon"" have been
limited by small number statistics. We utilize whole-sky WISE data to study 163
compact groups, thereby tripling our previous sample and including more
galaxies with intermediate mid-IR colors indicative of moderate specific star
formation rates (SSFRs). We define a distinct WISE mid-IR color-space
($\log[{\frac{\rm f_{12}}{\rm f_{4.6}}}]$ vs. $\log[{\frac{\rm f_{22}}{\rm
f_{3.4}}}]$) that we use to identify canyon galaxies from the larger sample. We
confirm that compact group galaxies show a bimodal distribution in the
mid-infrared and identify 37 canyon galaxies with reliable photometry and
intermediate mid-IR colors. Morphologically, we find that the canyon harbors a
large population of both Sa-Sbc and E/S0 type galaxies, and that they fall on
the optical red sequence rather than the green valley. Finally, we provide a
catalog of WISE photometry for 567 of 652 galaxies selected from the sample of
163 compact groups.

become an extremal spacetime. In case 1, we use a non extremal shell, calculate
all the thermodynamics quantities including the entropy, take it to the horizon
radius, and then take the extremal limit. In case 2, we take the extremal limit

horizon radius it also approaches extremality. In case 3, we build first an
extremal shell, and then take its horizon radius. We find that the
thermodynamic quantities in general have different expressions in the three
different cases. The entropy is the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy $ S=A_+/4$

centred on the binary and arises from spatial scales much smaller than the
bipolar Homunculus nebula, but likely larger than the central wind--wind
collision region between the stars as it does not vary over the $\sim$2-3 month
X-ray minimum when it can be observed. Using large-scale 3D smoothed particle
hydrodynamics (SPH) simulations, we model both the colliding-wind region
between the stars, and the region where the secondary wind collides with
primary wind ejected from the previous periastron passage. The simulations
extend out to one hundred semimajor axes and make two limiting assumptions
(strong coupling and no coupling) about the influence of the primary radiation
field on the secondary wind. We perform 3D radiative transfer calculations on
the SPH output to synthesize the X-ray emission, with the aim of reproducing
the CCE spectrum. For the preferred primary mass-loss rate
$\dot{M}_A\approx8.5\times10^{-4}$ M$_\odot$ yr$^{-1}$, the model spectra well
reproduce the observation as the strong- and no-coupling spectra bound the CCE
observation for longitude of periastron $\omega\approx252^\circ$, and
bound/converge on the observation for $\omega\approx90^\circ$. This suggests
that $\eta$ Carinae has moderate coupling between the primary radiation and
secondary wind, that both the region between the stars and the comoving

cannot place constraints on the binary's line of sight. We also discuss

substantial improvement in the spectroscopic determination of the neutron star
radius and mass of these neutron stars. Modeling the thermal emission from the
neutron star surface with a non-magnetized hydrogen atmosphere and accounting
for numerous sources of uncertainties, we obtain for the neutron star in X7 a
radius of $R=11.1^{+0.8}_{-0.7}$ km for an assumed stellar mass of $M=1.4$

presence of a He atmosphere is unlikely for this source. Due to eclipses and
variable absorption, the quiescent low-mass X-ray binary X5 provides less
stringent constraints, leading to a radius of $R=9.6^{+0.9}_{-1.1}$ km,
assuming a hydrogen atmosphere and a mass of $M=1.4$ M$_{\odot}$. When combined
with all other existing spectroscopic radius measurements, these measurements
strongly favor radii in the 9.9-11.2 km range for a ~1.5 M$_{\odot}$ neutron

the nucleonic ones that are consistent with laboratory experiments at low

precoding structure offers the potential to increase the achievable rate, it
also faces the challenge of the need of a low-complexity design. In specific,
the hybrid precoding may require matrix operations with a scale of antenna
size, which is generally large in mmWave communication. Moreover, the channel
estimation is also rather time consuming due to the large number of antennas at
both Tx/Rx sides. In this paper, a low-complexity hybrid precoding and channel
estimation approach is proposed. In the channel estimation phase, a
hierarchical multi-beam search scheme is proposed to fast acquire $N_{\rm{S}}$
(the number of streams) multipath components (MPCs)/clusters with the highest
powers. In the hybrid precoding phase, the analog and digital precodings are
decoupled. The analog precoding is designed to steer along the $N_{\rm{S}}$
acquired MPCs/clusters at both Tx/Rx sides, shaping an equivalent
$N_{\rm{S}}\times N_{\rm{S}}$ baseband channel, while the digital precoding
performs operations in the baseband with the reduced-scale channel. Performance
evaluations show that, compared with a state-of-the-art scheme, while achieving
a close or even better performance when the number of radio-frequency (RF)
chains or streams is small, both the computational complexity of the hybrid
precoding and the time complexity of the channel estimation are greatly
reduced.

the relative distance of electrons spins of Cooper pair and energy gap is
investigated. One of the results is, for d-wave case, concurrence (as a measure
of entanglement), quantum discord and tripartite are sensitive to the change of
magnitude of gap. Another result is both concurrence and discord oscillate.
Then, we consider three-dimensional rectangular nano-superconducting grain in

The dependence of quantum correlation to length of superconductor and lower
bound of robustness of tripartite entanglement are determined. Moreover, we
show that quantum correlation of d-wave nano-size superconducting grain
strongly depends on length of grain (in contrast to s-wave case). In general,
it is found that the length of grain lower, the effect of nano-size on quantum
correlation higher. Quantum tripartite for nano-scale d-wave superconductor is
better than for bulk d-wave superconductor. However, we find out both bulk and

electricity from substations to the loads. Structurally a distribution grid is
operated in one of several radial/tree-like topologies that are derived from an
original loopy grid graph by opening switches on some lines. Due to limited
presence of real-time switch monitoring devices, the operating structure needs
to be estimated indirectly. This paper presents a new learning algorithm that
uses only nodal voltage measurements to determine the operational radial
structure. The algorithm is based on the key result stating that the correct
operating structure is the optimal solution of the minimum-weight spanning tree
problem over the original loopy graph where weights on all permissible
edges/lines (open or closed) is the variance of nodal voltage difference at the
edge ends. Compared to existing work, this spanning tree based approach has
significantly lower complexity as it does not require information on line
parameters. Further, a modified learning algorithm is developed for cases when
the input voltage measurements are limited to only a subset of the total grid
nodes. Performance of the algorithms (with and without missing data) is
demonstrated by experiments on test cases.

of transmitters at which that message is known and a subset of receivers where
that message is desired. An outer bound on the general nine-message network is
obtained and then it is shown to be tight, establishing the DoF region for the
most general antenna setting wherein all four nodes have an arbitrary number of
antennas each. The DoF-optimal scheme is applicable to the MIMO 2x2 network
with constant channel coefficients, and hence, a fortiori, to time/frequency
varying channel scenarios. In particular, a linear precoding scheme is proposed
that can achieve all the DoF tuples in the DoF region. In it, the precise roles
played by transmit zero-forcing, interference alignment, random beamforming,
symbol extensions and asymmetric complex signaling are delineated. For
instance, we identify a class of antenna settings in which ACS is required to
achieve the fractional-valued corner points. Evidently, the DoF regions of all
previously unknown cases of the 2x2 interference network with a subset of the
nine-messages are established as special cases of the general result of this
paper. In particular, the DoF region of the well-known four-message (and even
three-message) MIMO X channel is established. This problem had remained open
despite previous studies which had found inner and outer bounds that were not
tight in general. Hence, the DoF regions of all special cases obtained from the
general DoF region of the nine-message 2x2 interference network of this work

i.e. two-dimensional spatial fields of total cloud cover and spectral radiance.
Model output is obtained from the COSMO-DE forward operator SynSat and compared
to SEVIRI satellite data. The aim of this study is twofold. First, to assess
the applicability of SAL to this kind of data, and second, to analyze the role
of external object identification algorithms (OIA) and the effects of
observational uncertainties on the resulting scores.
  As a feature based method, SAL requires external OIA. A comparison of three
different algorithms shows that the threshold level, which is a fundamental
part of all studied algorithms, induces high sensitivity and unstable behavior
of object dependent SAL scores (i.e. even very small changes in parameter
values can lead to large changes in the resulting scores). An in-depth
statistical analysis reveals significant effects on distributional quantities
commonly used in the interpretation of SAL, e.g. median and interquartile
distance. Two sensitivity indicators based on the univariate cumulative
distribution functions are derived. They allow to asses the sensitivity of the
SAL scores to threshold level changes without computationally expensive
iterative calculations of SAL for various thresholds. The mathematical
structure of these indicators connects the sensitivity of the SAL scores to
parameter changes with the effect of observational uncertainties.
  Finally, the discriminating power of SAL is studied. It is shown, that - for
large-scale cloud data - changes in the parameters may have larger effects on
the object dependent SAL scores (i.e. the S and L2 scores) than a complete loss
of temporal collocation.

development to enable a new generation of photoinjectors operated at cryogenic
temperatures that may attain, through enhancement of the launch field at the
photocathode, a significant increase in five-dimensional electron beam
brightness. We present detailed studies of the beam dynamics associated with
such a system, by examining an S-band photoinjector operated at 250 MV/m peak
electric field that reaches normalized emittances in the 40 nm-rad range at
charges (100-200 pC) suitable for use in a hard X-ray free-electron laser
(XFEL) scenario based on the LCLS. In this case, we show by start-to-end
simulations that the properties of this source may give rise to high efficiency
operation of an XFEL, and permit extension of the photon energy reach by an
order of magnitude, to over 80 keV. The brightness needed for such XFELs is
achieved through low source emittances in tandem with high current after
compression. In the XFEL examples analyzed, the emittances during final
compression are preserved using micro-bunching techniques. Extreme low
emittance scenarios obtained at pC charge, appropriate for significantly
extending temporal resolution limits of ultrafast electron diffraction and
microscopy experiments, are also reviewed. While the increase in brightness in
a cryogenic photoinjector is mainly due to the augmentation of the emission
current density via field enhancement, further possible increases in
performance arising from lowering the intrinsic cathode emittance in cryogenic
operation are also analyzed. Issues in experimental implementation, including
cavity optimization for lowering cryogenic thermal dissipation, external
coupling, and cryo-cooler system are discussed.

using ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) simulations. We investigate the
simulation cell size dependence of the surface tension of water from force
field molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, which show that the calculated
surface tension increases with increasing simulation cell size, thereby
illustrating that a correction for finite size effects is required for the
small system used in the AIMD simulation. The AIMD simulations reveal that the
double-{\xi} basis set overestimates the experimentally measured surface
tension due to the Pulay stress, while the triple and quadruple-{\xi} basis
sets give similar results. We further demonstrate that the van der Waals
corrections critically affect the surface tension. AIMD simulations without the
van der Waals correction substantially underestimate the surface tension, while
van der Waals correction with the Grimme's D2 technique results in the value
for the surface tension that is too high. The Grimme's D3 van der Waals
correction provides a surface tension close to the experimental value. Whereas
the specific choices for the van der Waals correction and basis sets critically
affect the calculated surface tension, the surface tension is remarkably
insensitive to the details of the exchange and correlation functionals, which
highlights the impact of long-range interactions on the surface tension. These
simulated values provide important benchmarks, both for improving van der Waals
corrections, and AIMD simulations of aqueous interfaces.

quantify the tradeoff between power consumption and queuing delay. Leveraging
on the Lyapunov optimization technique, the stochastic optimization problem can
be transformed into a per-slot penalized weighted sum rate maximization

the equivalence between the penalized weighted sum rate maximization problem
and the penalized weighted minimum mean square error (WMMSE) problem, the group
sparse beamforming optimization based WMMSE algorithm and the relaxed integer
programming based WMMSE algorithm are proposed to efficiently obtain the joint
RRH activation and beamforming policy. Both algorithms can converge to a
stationary solution with low-complexity and can be implemented in a parallel
manner, thus they are highly scalable to large-scale C-RANs. In addition, these

physicists for more than ten years. Rotation, enhanced diffusion, convection
overshoot, and magnetic fields are used to reconcile the new abundances with
helioseismology. The \textbf{too} low-helium \textbf{subsurface abundance} in
enhanced diffusion models can be improved by the mixing caused by rotation and
magnetic fields. The problem of the depth of the convective zone in rotating
models can be resolved by convection overshoot. Consequently the
Asplund-Grevesse-Sauval rotation model including overshooting (AGSR) reproduces
the seismically inferred sound-speed and density profiles, and the convection
zone depth as well as the Grevesse and Sauval (GS98) model computed before. But
this model fails to reproduce the surface helium abundance which is 0.2393
($2.6$ $\sigma$ away from the seismic value) and neutrino fluxes. The magnetic
model called AGSM keeps the agreement of the AGSR and improves the prediction
of the surface helium abundance. The observed separation ratios $r_{02}$ and
$r_{13}$ are reasonably reproduced by AGSM. Moreover, neutrino fluxes
calculated by this model are not far from the detected neutrino fluxes and the
predictions of previous works.

because of their applications to biomedicine, biological and chemical
disinfection, agriculture, and other areas. Without an understanding of the
near-surface gas dynamics, modellers are left to make assumptions about the
interfacial conditions. For instance it is commonly assumed that the surface
loss or sticking coefficient of gas-phase electrons at the interface is equal
to 1. In this work we explore the consequences of this assumption and introduce
a couple of ways to think about the electron interfacial condition. In one set
of simulations we impose a kinetic condition with varying surface loss
coefficient on the gas phase interfacial electrons. In a second set of
simulations we introduce a Henry's law like condition at the interface in which
the gas-phase electron concentration is assumed to be in thermodynamic
equilibrium with the liquid-phase electron concentration. It is shown that for
a range of electron Henry coefficients spanning a range of known hydrophilic
specie Henry coefficients, the gas phase electron density in the anode can vary
by orders of magnitude. Varying reflection of electrons by the interface also
has consequences for the electron energy profile. This variation in anode
electron density and energy as a function of the interface characteristics
could also lead to significant variation in near-surface gas chemistries when
such reactions are included in the model; this could very well in turn affect
the reactive species impinging on the liquid surface. We draw the conclusion
that in order to make more confident model predictions about plasma-liquid
systems, finer scale simulations and/or new experimental techniques must be
used to elucidate the near-surface gas phase electron dynamics.

the constraint set is equipped with a self-concordant barrier. Our approach
relies on the following two main ideas. First, we re-parameterize the
optimality condition as an auxiliary problem, such that a good initial point is
available; by doing so, a family of alternative paths towards the optimum is
generated. Second, we combine the proximal operator with path-following ideas
to design a single-phase, proximal, path-following algorithm. Our method has
several advantages. First, it allows handling non-smooth objectives via
proximal operators; this avoids lifting the problem dimension in order to
accommodate non-smooth components in optimization. Second, it consists of only
a \emph{single phase}: While the overall convergence rate of classical
path-following schemes for self-concordant objectives does not suffer from the
initialization phase, proximal path-following schemes undergo slow convergence,
in order to obtain a good starting point \cite{TranDinh2013e}. In this work, we
show how to overcome this limitation in the proximal setting and prove that our
scheme has the same $\mathcal{O}(\sqrt{\nu}\log(1/\varepsilon))$ worst-case
iteration-complexity with standard approaches \cite{Nesterov2004,Nesterov1994}
without requiring an initial phase, where $\nu$ is the barrier parameter and
$\varepsilon$ is a desired accuracy. Finally, our framework allows errors in
the calculation of proximal-Newton directions, without sacrificing the
worst-case iteration complexity. We demonstrate the merits of our algorithm via
three numerical examples, where proximal operators play a key role.

inversion symmetry, have recently received special attentions due to the
expectation of unconventional pairings and exotic physics associated with such
pairings. The newly discovered superconductors A2Cr3As3 (A=K, Rb), featured by
the quasi-one dimensional structure with conducting CrAs chains, belongs to
such kind of superconductor. In this study, we are the first to report the
finding that the superconductivity of A2Cr3As3 (A=K, Rb) has a positive
correlation with the extent of non-centrosymmetry. Our in-situ high pressure ac
susceptibility and synchrotron x-ray diffraction measurements reveal that the
larger bond angle of As-Cr-As in the CrAs chains can be taken as a key factor
controlling superconductivity. While the smaller bond angle and the distance
between the CrAs chains also affect the superconductivity due to their
structural connections with the angle. We find that the larger value of the
difference between the larger and samller angles, which is associated with the
extent of the non-centrosymmetry of the lattice structure, is in favor of
superconductivity. These results are expected to shed a new light on the
underlying mechanism of the superconductivity in these Q1D superconductors and
also to provide new perspective in understanding other non-centrosymmetric
superconductors.

gamma ray burst (GRB) detectors, and more notably the ground--based
gravitational wave detectors, typically have large uncertainties in the sky
positions of detected sources. Searching these large sky regions spanning
hundreds of square degrees is a formidable challenge for most ground--based
optical telescopes, which can usually image less than tens of square degrees of
the sky in a single night. We present algorithms for optimal scheduling of such
follow--up observations in order to maximize the probability of imaging the
optical counterpart, based on the all--sky probability distribution of the
source position. We incorporate realistic observing constraints like the
diurnal cycle, telescope pointing limitations, available observing time, and
the rising/setting of the target at the observatory location. We use
simulations to demonstrate that our proposed algorithms outperform the default
greedy observing schedule used by many observatories. Our algorithms are
applicable for follow--up of other transient sources with large positional
uncertainties, like Fermi--detected GRBs, and can easily be adapted for
scheduling radio or space--based X--ray followup.

into account radiation and ionization in the equation of state. Two types of
star, an intermediate-mass star and a massive star, were considered. To avoid a
long thermal relaxation time of the intermediate-mass star, we increased the
stellar energy flux artificially while trying to maintain a structure close to
the one given by a 1D stellar model. A parametric study of the flux factor was
performed. For the massive star, no such process was necessary. Numerical
results were analysed when the system reached the statistical steady state. It
was shown that the penetration distance in pressure scaleheights is of the
order of unity. The scaling relations between penetration distance, input flux
and vertical velocity fluctuations studied by Singh et al. were checked. The
anisotropy of the turbulent convection and the diffusion models of the
third-order moments representing the non-local transport were also
investigated. These models are dramatically affected by the velocity fields and
no universal constant parameters seem to exist. The limitations of the

cameras have been an emerging technology as a non-extractive mean to estimate
the abundance of fish stocks. Tracking live fish in an open aquatic environment
posts challenges that are different from general pedestrian or vehicle tracking
in surveillance applications. In many rough habitats fish are monitored by
cameras installed on moving platforms, where tracking is even more challenging
due to inapplicability of background models. In this paper, a novel tracking
algorithm based on the deformable multiple kernels (DMK) is proposed to address
these challenges. Inspired by the deformable part model (DPM) technique, a set
of kernels is defined to represent the holistic object and several parts that
are arranged in a deformable configuration. Color histogram, texture histogram
and the histogram of oriented gradients (HOG) are extracted and serve as object
features. Kernel motion is efficiently estimated by the mean-shift algorithm on
color and texture features to realize tracking. Furthermore, the HOG-feature
deformation costs are adopted as soft constraints on kernel positions to
maintain the part configuration. Experimental results on practical video set
from underwater moving cameras show the reliable performance of the proposed
method with much less computational cost comparing with state-of-the-art
techniques.

Toward this end, we propose an underwater fish recognition framework that
consists of a fully unsupervised feature learning technique and an
error-resilient classifier. Object parts are initialized based on saliency and
relaxation labeling to match object parts correctly. A non-rigid part model is
then learned based on fitness, separation and discrimination criteria. For the
classifier, an unsupervised clustering approach generates a binary class
hierarchy, where each node is a classifier. To exploit information from
ambiguous images, the notion of partial classification is introduced to assign
coarse labels by optimizing the ""benefit"" of indecision made by the classifier.
Experiments show that the proposed framework achieves high accuracy on both
public and self-collected underwater fish images with high uncertainty and
class imbalance.

disc-to-total ratios are close to 1 for all the simulated galaxies, the
kinematic ratios are around ~0.5. Thus, exponential structure does not imply a
cold kinematic disc. Above log(M*)~9.5, the decomposition leads to thin discs

(LAT) display spectra with exponential cutoffs falling in a narrow range around
a few GeV. Early spectral modelling predicted spectral cutoff energies of up to
100 GeV. More modern studies estimated spectral cutoff energies in the 1-20 GeV
range. It was therefore not expected that pulsars would be visible in the
very-high-energy (VHE; >100 GeV) regime. The VERITAS detection (confirmed by
MAGIC) of pulsed emission from the Crab pulsar up to 400 GeV (and now possibly
up to 1 TeV) therefore raised important questions about our understanding of
the electrodynamics and local environment of pulsars. H.E.S.S. has now detected
pulsed emission from the Vela pulsar in the 20-120 GeV range, making this the
second pulsar detected by a ground-based Cherenkov telescope. We will review
the latest developments in VHE pulsar science, including an overview of recent
observations and refinements to radiation models and magnetic field structures.
This will assist us in interpreting the VHE emission detected from the Crab and
Vela pulsars, and predicting the level of VHE emission expected from other
pulsars, which will be very important for the upcoming CTA.

many challenges. One particular concern is on the control-plane resilience,
while the existing protection approaches proposed for SDN networks mainly focus
on data-plane. In order to achieve the carrier-grade recovery from link
failures, we adopt the dedicated protection scheme towards finding optimal
protection routing for control-plane traffic. To this end, we study a weighted
cost minimization problem, in which the traffic load balancing and flow table
rule placement are jointly considered when selecting protection paths for
controller-switch sessions. Because this problem is known as NP-hard, we
propose a Markov approximation based combinatorial optimization approach for
routing protection in SDN control-plane, which produces near-optimal solution
in a distributed fashion. We then extend our solution to an on-line case that
can handle the single-link failure one at a time. The induced performance
fluctuation is also analyzed with theoretical derivation. Extensive
experimental results show that our proposed algorithm has fast convergence and
high efficiency in resource utilization.

intrinsic dipolar magnetic field due to a non-rotating central object. In this
paper, we generalize the Newtonian theory of stationary axisymmetric resistive
tori of Tripathy, Prasanna $\&$ Das (1990) by including the fully general
relativistic features. If we are to obtain the steady state configuration, we
have to take into account the finite resistivity for the magnetofluid in order
to avoid the piling up of the field lines anywhere in the accretion discs. The
efficient value of conductivity must be much smaller than the classical
conductivity to be astrophysically interesting. The accreting plasma in the
presence of an external dipole magnetic field gives rise to a current in the
azimuthal direction. The azimuthal current produced due to the motion of the
magnetofluid modifies the magnetic field structure inside the disc and
generates a poloidal magnetic field for the disc. The solutions we have found
show that the radial inflow, pressure and density distributions are strongly
modified by the electrical conductivity both in relativistic and Newtonian
regimes. However, the range of conductivity coefficient is different for both
regimes, as well as that of the angular momentum parameter and the radius of
the innermost stable circular orbit. Furthermore, it is shown that the
azimuthal velocity of the disc which is not dependent on conductivity is
sub-Keplerian in all radial distances for both regimes. Owing to the presence
of pressure gradient and magnetic forces. This work may also be important for
the general relativistic computational magnetohydrodynamics that suffers from
the lack of exact analytic solutions that are needed to test computer codes.

patient position during the VMAT treatment by ensuring a linear ramp-like dose
profile in treatment field overlap regions.
  Background: Craniospinal irradiation (CSI) is considered technically
challenging because the target size exceeds the maximal field size, which
necessitates using abutted or overlapping treatment fields. Volumetric
modulated arc therapy (VMAT) is increasingly being examined for CSI, as it
offers both better dose homogeneity and better dose conformance while also
offering a possibility to create field junctions which are more robust towards
small shifts in patient position during the treatment.
  Materials and Methods: A VMAT treatment plan with three isocenters was made
for a test case patient. Three groups of overlapping arc field pairs were used;
one for the cranial and two for the spinal part. In order to assure a ramp-like
dose profile in the field overlap region, the upper spinal part was optimised
first, with dose prescription explicitely enforcing a ramp-like dose profile.
The cranial and lower spinal part were done afterwards, taking into account the
dose contribution of the upper spinal fields.
  Results: Using simple geometrical reasoning, we demonstrated that hot- and
cold spots which arise from small displacement of one treatment field relative
to the other treatment field can be reduced by taking two precautions: (a)
widening the field overlap region, and (b) reducing the field gradient across
the overlap region. The function with the smallest maximal gradient is a linear
ramp. We present a treatment planning technique which yields the desired dose
profile of the two contributing fields, and minimises dosimetric dependence on
minor positional errors in patient set-up.

transport of elastically tunneling electrons in magnetic scanning tunneling
microscopy (STM). The method is based on the three-dimensional
Wentzel-Kramers-Brillouin (3D-WKB) approach combined with electronic structure
calculations using first principles density functional theory. As an
application, we analyze the STM contrast inversion of the charge current above
the Fe/W(110) surface depending on the bias voltage, tip-sample distance and
relative magnetization orientation between the sample and an iron tip. For the
spin transfer torque (STT) vector we find that its in-plane component is
generally larger than the out-of-plane component, and we identify a
longitudinal spin current component, which, however, does not contribute to the
torque. Our results suggest that the torque-current relationship in magnetic
STM junctions follows the power law rather than a linear function.
Consequently, we show that the ratio between the STT and the spin-polarized
charge current is not constant, and more importantly, it can be tuned by the
bias voltage, tip-sample distance and magnetization rotation. We find that the
STT efficiency can be enhanced by about a factor of seven by selecting a proper
bias voltage. Thus, we demonstrate the possible enhancement of the STT
efficiency in magnetic STM junctions, which can be exploited in technological
applications. We discuss our results in view of the indirect measurement of the
STT above the Fe/W(110) surface reported by Krause et al. in Phys. Rev. Lett.

Fermi surface reconstruction processes without spontaneous symmetry breaking,

Using quantum oscillations of magnetoresistance and magnetic susceptibility,
supported by density-functional theory calculations, we determined that the
main hole Fermi surface of TaSb$_{2}$ forms a unique shoulder structure along
the $F-L$ line. The flat band top of this shoulder pocket is just a few meV
above the Fermi level, leading to the observed topological phase transition at
20 K when the shoulder pocket disappears. Further increase in temperature
pushes the Fermi level to the band top of the main hole pocket, induced the

subwavelength scale theoretically permit to focus waves onto focal spots much
smaller than the free space wavelength. To do so metamaterials -manmade
composite media exhibiting properties not available in nature- are usually
considered. However this approach is limited to narrow bandwidths due to their
resonant nature. Here, we prove that it is possible to use a fractal resonator
alongside time reversal to focus microwaves onto $\lambda/15$ subwavelength
focal spots from the far field, on extremely wide bandwidths. We first
numerically prove that this approach can be realized using a multiple channel
time reversal mirror, that utilizes all the degrees of freedom offered by the
fractal resonator. Then we experimentally demonstrate that this approach can be
drastically simplified by coupling the fractal resonator to a complex medium,
here a cavity, that efficiently converts its spatial degrees of freedom into
temporal ones. This allows to achieve deep subwavelength focusing of microwaves
using a single channel time reversal. Our method can be generalized to other
systems coupling complex media and fractal resonators.

Watanabe (1965) and McKean (1975), by allowing for polynomial nonlinearity in
the pair $(u, Du)$, where $u$ is the solution of the PDE with space gradient
$Du$. Similar to the previous literature, our result requires a non-explosion

Labordere, Tan and Touzi (2015), based on the Malliavin integration by parts,
which allows to account for the nonlinearities in the gradient. As a
consequence, the particles of our branching diffusion are marked by the nature
of the nonlinearity. This new representation has very important numerical
implications as it is suitable for Monte Carlo simulation. Indeed, this
provides the first numerical method for high dimensional nonlinear PDEs with
error estimate induced by the dimension-free Central limit theorem. The
complexity is also easily seen to be of the order of the squared dimension. The

hard Fourier component typically lags behind the soft component. Despite
decades of observations of this phenomenon, the underlying physical explanation
for the time lags has remained elusive, although there are suggestions that
Compton reverberation plays an important role. However, the lack of analytical
solutions has hindered the interpretation of the available data. In this paper,
we investigate the generation of X-ray time lags in Compton scattering coronae
using a new mathematical approach based on analysis of the Fourier-transformed
transport equation. By solving this equation, we obtain the Fourier transform
of the radiation Green's function, which allows us to calculate the exact
dependence of the time lags on the Fourier frequency, for both homogeneous and
inhomogeneous coronal clouds. We use the new formalism to explore a variety of
injection scenarios, including both monochromatic and broadband
(bremsstrahlung) seed photon injection. We show that our model can successfully
reproduce both the observed time lags and the time-averaged (quiescent) X-ray
spectra for Cyg~X-1 and GX~339-04, using a single set of coronal parameters for
each source. The time lags are the result of impulsive bremsstrahlung injection
occurring near the outer edge of the corona, while the time-averaged spectra
are the result of continual distributed injection of soft photons throughout
the cloud.

approach for topological interference management (TIM) in the partially
connected K-user interference channel. No channel state information (CSI) is
required at the transmitters except the network topology information. The
previous attempt on the TIM problem is mainly based on its equivalence to the
index coding problem, but so far only a few index coding problems have been
solved. In contrast, in this paper, we present an algorithmic approach to
investigate the achievable degrees-of-freedom (DoFs) by recasting the TIM
problem as an LRMC problem. Unfortunately, the resulting LRMC problem is known
to be NP-hard, and the main contribution of this paper is to propose a
Riemannian pursuit (RP) framework to detect the rank of the matrix to be
recovered by iteratively increasing the rank. This algorithm solves a sequence
of fixed-rank matrix completion problems. To address the convergence issues in
the existing fixed-rank optimization methods, the quotient manifold geometry of
the search space of fixed-rank matrices is exploited via Riemannian
optimization. By further exploiting the structure of the low-rank matrix
varieties, i.e., the closure of the set of fixed- rank matrices, we develop an
efficient rank increasing strategy to find good initial points in the procedure
of rank pursuit. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed RP algorithm
achieves a faster convergence rate and higher achievable DoFs for the TIM
problem compared with the state-of-the-art methods.

here has a power-law nonlinearity characterized by a real parameter $q$
(formally corresponding to the Tsallis entropic parameter) in such a way that
the standard linear Proca wave equation is recovered in the limit $q

besides the usual vectorial field $\Psi^{\mu}(\vec{x},t)$, involves an
additional field $\Phi^{\mu}(\vec{x},t)$. We obtain exact time dependent
soliton-like solutions for these fields having the form of a $q$-plane wave,

relation $E^{2} = p^{2}c^{2} + m^{2}c^{4}$ for all values of $q$. This suggests
that the present nonlinear theory constitutes a new field theoretical

the $q$-plane waves yield localized, transverse solutions of Maxwell equations.
