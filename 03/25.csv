collisions at 130 and 270 MeV deuteron beam energy. The breakup amplitude is
calculated using the first term in the Neumann series expansion of the
corresponding exact four-nucleon equations. In analogy with nucleon-deuteron
breakup where an equivalent approximation is compared with exact calculations,
we expect this single-scattering approximation to provide a rough estimation of
three-body breakup observables in quasifree configurations. We predict the
nucleon-deuteron and deuteron-deuteron three-cluster breakup cross sections to
be of a comparable size and thereby question the reliability of the recent

output matrices is studied, where an array is called observable when
identically zero relative outputs imply synchronized solutions for the
individual systems. It is shown that the observability of an array is
equivalent to the connectivity of its interconnection graph, whose edges are
assigned matrix weights. The interconnection graph is studied by means of a
collection of simpler graphs, each of which is associated to an eigenvalue of
the system matrix of individual dynamics. It is reported that the
interconnection graph is connected if and only if no member of this collection
is disconnected. Moreover, to better understand the relative behavior of
distant units, pairwise observability which concerns with the synchronization
of a certain pair of individual systems in the array is studied. This milder
version of observability is shown to be closely related to certain connectivity
properties of the interconnection graph as well. Pairwise observability is also
analyzed using the circuit theoretic tool effective conductance. The
observability of a certain pair of units is proved to be equivalent to the
nonsingularity of the (matrix-valued) effective conductance between the
associated pair of nodes of a resistive network (with matrix-valued parameters)
whose node admittance matrix is the Laplacian of the array's interconnection
graph.

observations on their actually traversed routes. Consequently, they are mired
with uncertainty. In this paper, we develop a technique called InferTra to
infer uncertain trajectories from network-constrained partial observations.
Rather than predicting the most likely route, the inferred uncertain trajectory
takes the form of an edge-weighted graph and summarizes all probable routes in
a holistic manner. For trajectory inference, InferTra employs Gibbs sampling by
learning a Network Mobility Model (NMM) from a database of historical
trajectories. Extensive experiments on real trajectory databases show that the
graph-based approach of InferTra is up to 50% more accurate, 20 times faster,

Employed in a vast body of chemical engineering works, the state of the art
PC-SAFT model has been recently introduced in studies aimed at Titan. Here, I
revisit the issue of the speed of sound in Titan's liquids, in the light of
this theory. I describe, in detail, the derivation of the speed of sound from
the chosen equation of state and the potential limitations of the approach. To
make estimations of the composition of a ternary liquid mixture N2:CH4:C2H6

It is shown that 50 measures between 90 K and 100 K are enough to ensure an

discontinuities that are remarkably consistent in color (effective
temperature). This consistency is apparent even among some of the most massive
clusters hosting multiple distinct sub-populations (such as NGC 2808, omega
Cen, and NGC 6715), demonstrating that these phenomena are primarily driven by
atmospheric physics that is independent of the underlying population
properties. However, inconsistencies arise in the metal-rich clusters NGC 6388

shifts ~1,000 K to 2,000 K hotter. We demonstrate that this shift is likely due

affects the surface convection and evolution of such stars. Our survey also
increases the number of Galactic globular clusters known to host blue-hook

internal degree of freedom corresponds to a Hilbert space, called coin system.
We consider QWs on Cayley graphs of some group $G$. In the literature,
investigations concerning infinite $G$ have been focused on graphs
corresponding to $G=\mathbb{Z}^d$ with coin system of dimension 2, whereas for
one-dimensional coin (so called scalar QWs) only the case of finite $G$ has
been studied. Here we prove that the evolution of a scalar QW with $G$ infinite
Abelian is trivial, providing a thorough classification of this kind of walks.
Then we consider the infinite dihedral group $D_\infty$, that is the unique
non-Abelian group $G$ containing a subgroup $H\cong\mathbb{Z}$ with two cosets.
We characterize the class of QWs on the Cayley graphs of $D_\infty$ and, via a
coarse-graining technique, we show that it coincides with the class of
spinorial walks on $\mathbb{Z}$ which satisfies parity symmetry. This class of
QWs includes the Weyl and the Dirac QWs. Remarkably, there exist also spinorial
walks that are not coarse-graining of a scalar QW, such as the Hadamard walk.

divergent regions with unusually high or low risk of disease. Leave-one-out
cross-validatory (LOOCV) model assessment is the gold standard for estimating
predictive p-values that can flag such divergent regions. However, actual LOOCV
is time-consuming because one needs to rerun a Markov chain Monte Carlo
analysis for each posterior distribution in which an observation is held out as
a test case. This paper introduces a new method, called integrated importance
sampling (iIS), for estimating LOOCV predictive p-values with only Markov chain
samples drawn from the posterior based on a full data set. The key step in iIS
is that we integrate away the latent variables associated the test observation
with respect to their conditional distribution \textit{without} reference to
the actual observation. By following the general theory for importance
sampling, the formula used by iIS can be proved to be equivalent to the LOOCV
predictive p-value. We compare iIS and other three existing methods in the
literature with two disease mapping datasets. Our empirical results show that
the predictive p-values estimated with iIS are almost identical to the
predictive p-values estimated with actual LOOCV, and outperform those given by
the existing three methods, namely, the posterior predictive checking, the
ordinary importance sampling, and the ghosting method by Marshall and
Spiegelhalter (2003).

jet. Yet, the compact jet bulk velocity, $v$, is poorly constrained in the

often unified with relativistic jets in active galactic nuclei. We have
estimated $v$ as part of a temporal analysis of GRS~1915+105 jets in ""high
plateau states"" (HPS). We define the HPS as a state showing a hard X-ray
spectrum and low level of long-term ($>10$s) X-ray activity associated with 15
GHz flux density $>70$ mJy for $>7$ consecutive days. The radio emission is
associated with compact jet emission. Two HPS were monitored at 15 GHz during
their termination with e-folding times of 3.8 hrs and 8.6 hrs. We combine this
time scale with the scale of spatial variation of the linear source of a VLBA
image preceding the fade of one of these HPS in order to estimate the jet
speed. Our assumption that the reduction in radio emissivity propagates as an
approximate discontinuity down the HPS jet (leaving a weak jet in its wake)
indicates $0.17 <v/c< 0.43$. This agrees closely with the only other existing
$v$ estimates that are derived directly from radio images, jet asymmetry
produced by Doppler enhancement.

states. To the clean Hamiltonian we add a surface disorder potential of the
most general hermitian form, $V = V^0(\theta,\phi) + {\bf V}(\theta,\phi) \cdot
{\bf \sigma}$. We expand these four disorder functions in spherical harmonics
and draw the expansion coefficients randomly from a four-dimensional, zero-mean
gaussian distribution. Different strengths and classes of disorder are realized
by specifying the $4 \times 4$ covariance matrix. For each instantiation of the
disorder, we solve for the energy spectrum via exact diagonalization. Then we
compute the disorder-averaged density of states, $\rho(E)$, by averaging over
200,000 different instantiations. Disorder broadens the Landau-level delta
functions of the clean density of states into peaks that decay and merge
together. If the spin-dependent term is dominant, these peaks split due to the
breaking of the degeneracy between time-reversed partner states. Increasing
disorder strength pushes states closer and closer to zero energy (the Dirac
point), resulting in a low-energy density of states that becomes nonzero for
sufficient disorder, typically approaching an energy-independent saturation
value, for most classes of disorder. But for purely spin-dependent disorder
with ${\bf V}$ either entirely out-of-surface or entirely in-surface, we
identify intriguing disorder-induced features in the vicinity of the Dirac
point. In the out-of-surface case, a new peak emerges at zero energy. In the
in-surface case, we see a symmetry-protected zero at zero energy, with
$\rho(E)$ increasing linearly toward nonzero-energy peaks. These striking
features are explained in terms of the breaking (or not) of two chiral
symmetries of the clean Hamiltonian.

density difference between the vacua, is small compared to the barrier height,
this occurs in the thin-wall regime studied by Coleman and De Luccia. However,

uncertainty. Standard market designs, such as simultaneous or English auctions,
compound this with uncertainty about the price a bidder will have to pay in
order to win. As a result they tend to confuse the process of search both by
leading to wasteful information acquisition on goods that have already found a
good purchaser and by discouraging needed investigations of objects,
potentially eliminating all gains from trade. In contrast, we show that the
Dutch auction preserves all of its properties from a standard setting without
information costs because it guarantees, at the time of information
acquisition, a price at which the good can be purchased. Calibrations to
start-up acquisition and timber auctions suggest that in practice the social
losses through poor search coordination in standard formats are an order of
magnitude or two larger than the (negligible) inefficiencies arising from
ex-ante bidder asymmetries.

hypotheses containing multiple births and death within the MCMC sampling. This
alleviates the burden of having to exhaustively enumerate all birth and death

of local, centralized, and P2P backup. In this paper, we look at two untouched
aspects of social storage systems. One aspect involves modelling social storage
as an endogenous social network, where agents themselves decide with whom they
want to build data backup relation. The second aspect involves studying the
stability of social storage systems, which would help reduce maintenance costs
and further, help build efficient as well as contented networks.
  We have a four fold contribution that covers the above two aspects. We,
first, model the social storage system as a strategic network formation game.
We define the utility of each agent in the network under two different
frameworks. Second, we propose the concept of bilateral stability which refines
the pairwise stability concept defined by Jackson et. al. 1996, by requiring
mutual consent for both addition and deletion of links, as compared to mutual
consent just for link addition. Mutual consent for link deletion is especially
important in the social storage setting. Third, we prove necessary and the
sufficient conditions for bilateral stability of social storage networks. For
symmetric social storage networks, we prove that there exists a unique
neighborhood size, independent of the number of agents (for all non-trivial
cases), where no pair of agents has any incentive to increase or decrease their
neighborhood size. We call this neighborhood size as the stability point.
Fourth, given the number of agents and other parameters, we discuss which
bilaterally stable networks would evolve and also discuss which of these stable
networks are efficient --- that is, stable networks with maximum sum of
utilities of all agents. We also discuss ways to build contented networks,
where each agent achieves the maximum possible utility.

the 100 Mbit/s speed required by the EC's policy target, unless vectoring is
adopted along with a suitable Multi-Operator Vectoring (MOV) technique. Some
vendors recently proposed enlarging the bandwidth up to 35.2~MHz (so-called
e-VDSL) as one possible solution to increase the 100 Mbit/s coverage. However,
as we show in the paper, the bandwidth advantage is illusory as an ""ideal MOV""
is not implementable with today's technology, and alien-FEXT practically
destroys the envisaged data-rate increase. Therefore, we introduce the Sub-band
Vectoring (SBV) technique, as one practical solution, which turns out to be
near optimal in terms of achievable data-rate, as well as incremental for those
Countries where the NRA adopts sub-loop unbundling regulation. SBV adopts a
novel frequency division multiplexing approach, which imposes one fairness
condition to equalize data-rate values and overall bandwidth per operator at
different distances. The paper shows that e-VDSL with SBV is robust, as it can
cope with relatively high values of vectoring impairments. It also shows that
the SBV allows up to three co-located operators with e-VDSL to coexist, without
imposing any of the burdensome coordination limitations of the ideal MOV
architecture. Our results show that the SBV allows achieving up to 210 Mbit/s
per user for e-VDSL and up to 620 Mbit/s per user for a bandwidth expanded up
to 105.6 MHz, with two telecom operators. Finally, the paper shows that a

achieved in a simple way.

structures, namely deep neural networks (DNN) and relation-modulated neural
nets (RMNN), on several probabilistic reasoning tasks in AI, including
recognizing textual entailment, triple classification in multi-relational
knowledge bases and commonsense reasoning. Experimental results on several
popular datasets derived from WordNet, FreeBase and ConceptNet have all
demonstrated that both DNNs and RMNNs perform equally well and they can
significantly outperform the conventional methods available for these reasoning
tasks. Moreover, compared with DNNs, RMNNs are superior in knowledge transfer,
where a pre-trained model can be quickly extended to an unseen relation after
observing only a few training samples. To further prove the effectiveness of
the proposed models, in this work, we have applied NAMs to solving challenging
Winograd Schema (WS) problems. Experiments conducted on a set of WS problems
prove that the proposed models have the potential for commonsense reasoning.

field, then certain characteristic $p$ representations of Galois groups over
$F$ arise from Hilbert modular forms. Moreover it predicts the set of weights
of such forms in terms of the local behavior of the Galois representation at
primes over $p$. This characterization of the weights, which is formulated
using $p$-adic Hodge theory, is known under mild technical hypotheses if $p >
2$. In this paper we give, under the assumption that $p$ is unramified in $F$,
a conjectural alternative description for the set of weights. Our approach is
to use the Artin-Hasse exponential and local class field theory to construct
bases for local Galois cohomology spaces in terms of which we identify
subspaces that should correspond to ones defined using $p$-adic Hodge theory.
The resulting conjecture amounts to an explicit description of wild
ramification in reductions of certain crystalline Galois representations. It
enables the direct computation of the set of Serre weights of a Galois
representation, which we illustrate with numerical examples. A proof of this
conjecture has been announced by Calegari, Emerton, Gee and Mavrides.

high-precision personal geographical data. Malicious use of these sensitive
data will threaten the privacy of LBS users. Although privacy research in LBSs
has received wide attention, related works are mostly focused on some specific
applications. Due to high diversity of LBSs, it is critical to build a
universal model that is able to handle privacy protection for broader range of
applications. In this paper, we propose a Computationally Recoverable
Camouflage (CRC) model, where LBS users can preserve privacy by reporting
camouflaged location information and are able to flexibly leverage between the
service quality and the achieved privacy in different applications by adjusting
the precision of the camouflage information. In particular, we propose a novel
camouflage algorithm with formal privacy guarantee that considers both location
context and social context, enabling LBS users to scalably expose camouflage

Ciphertext Policy Attribute-Based Encryption (SCP-ABE) algorithm to enforce
fine-grained access control on the two-dimensional-scalable camouflage

demonstrated the computational efficiency of the proposed CRC model.

Matter signals. When setting limits on particle Dark Matter properties from

density profile within these systems is constrained by observations. In the
limit in which the spherical Jeans equation is assumed to be valid for a given
tracer stellar population, we study the solution of this equation having the
Dark Matter mass profile as an output rather than as a trial parametric input.
Within our new formulation, we address to what level dwarf spheroidal galaxies
feature a reliable mass estimator. We assess then possible extrapolation of the
density profiles in the inner regions and -- keeping explicit the dependence on
the orbital anisotropy profile of the tracer population -- we derive general
trends on the line-of-sight integral of the density profile squared, a quantity
commonly dubbed $J$-factor and crucial to estimate fluxes from prompt Dark
Matter pair annihilations. Taking Ursa Minor as a study case among Milky Way
satellites, we perform Bayesian inference using the available kinematical data
for this galaxy. Contrary to all previous studies, we avoid marginalization
over quantities poorly constrained by observations or by theoretical arguments.
We find minimal $J$-factors to be about 2 to 4 times smaller than commonly
quoted estimates, approximately relaxing by the same amount the limit on Dark
Matter pair annihilation cross section from gamma-ray surveys of Ursa Minor. At
the same time, if one goes back to a fixed trial parametric form for the
density, e.g. using a NFW or Burkert profile, we show that the minimal $J$ can
hardly be reduced by more than a factor of 1.5.

improve our detection by combining them. Second, we carry out a detailed

accelerators (PeVatrons), but all proposed models of Galactic cosmic-ray
accelerators encounter non-trivial difficulties at exactly these energies. Tens
of Galactic accelerators capable of accelerating particle to tens of TeV (1 TeV
=$10^\mathbf{12}$ electron volts) energies were inferred from recent gamma-ray
observations. None of the currently known accelerators, however, not even the
handful of shell-type supernova remnants commonly believed to supply most
Galactic cosmic rays, have shown the characteristic tracers of PeV particles:
power-law spectra of gamma rays extending without a cutoff or a spectral break
to tens of TeV. Here we report deep gamma-ray observations with arcminute
angular resolution of the Galactic Centre regions, which show the expected
tracer of the presence of PeV particles within the central 10~parsec of the
Galaxy. We argue that the supermassive black hole Sagittarius A* is linked to
this PeVatron. Sagittarius A* went through active phases in the past, as
demonstrated by X-ray outbursts and an outflow from the Galactic Centre.
Although its current rate of particle acceleration is not sufficient to provide
a substantial contribution to Galactic cosmic rays, Sagittarius A* could have
plausibly been more active over the last $\gtrsim 10^{6-7}$ years, and
therefore should be considered as a viable alternative to supernova remnants as
a source of PeV Galactic cosmic rays.

multiple star system and a bona fide star cluster? In this paper, we present a
possible framework to address this question, by studying the distributions of
disruption times for chaotic gravitational encounters as a function of the
number of interacting particles. To this end, we perform a series of numerical
scattering experiments with the \texttt{FEWBODY} code, to calculate the
distributions of disruption times as a function of both the particle number N
and the virial coefficient k. The subsequent distributions are fit with a
physically-motivated function, consisting of an initial exponential decay
followed by a very slowly decreasing tail at long encounter times due to
long-lived quasi-stable encounters. We find three primary features
characteristic of the calculated distributions of disruption times. These are:
(1) the system half-life increases with increasing particle number, (2) the
fraction of long-lived quasi-stable encounters increases with increasing
particle number and (3) both the system half-life and the fraction of
quasi-stable encounters increase with decreasing virial coefficient. We discuss
the significance of our results for collisional dynamics, and consider the
extrapolation of our results to larger-N systems. We suggest that this could
potentially offer a clear and unambiguous distinction between star clusters and
(unstable or quasi-stable) multiple star systems. Although we are limited by
very small-number statistics, our results tentatively suggest that (for our
assumptions) this transition occurs at a critical particle number of order 100.

investigate the scattering property from diffuse Galactic light (DGL)
measurements at 1.25, 2.2, and 3.5 {\mu}m in addition to our recent analyses of
diffuse near-IR emission (Sano et al. 2015; Sano et al. 2016). As a result, we
first find that the intensity ratios of near-IR DGL to 100 {\mu}m emission
increase toward low Galactic latitudes at 1.25 and 2.2 {\mu}m. The derived
latitude dependence can be reproduced by a scattered light model of
interstellar dust with a large scattering asymmetry factor g = <cos{\theta}> of
$0.8^{+0.2}_{-0.3}$ at 1.25 and 2.2 {\mu}m, assuming an infinite Galaxy disk as
an illuminating source. The derived asymmetry factor is comparable to the
values obtained in the optical, but several times larger than that expected
from a recent dust model. Since possible latitude dependence of
ultraviolet-excited dust emission at 1.25 and 2.2 {\mu}m would reduce the large
asymmetry factor to the reasonable value, our result may indicate the first
detection of such an additional emission component in the diffuse interstellar

highly eccentric streams resulting from tidal disruption events (TDEs). We
perform three dimensional radiation hydrodynamic simulations to show that
stream collisions can contribute significant optical and ultraviolet light to
the flares produced by TDEs, and can sometimes explain the majority of the
observed emission. Our simulations focus on the region near the radiation
pressure dominated shock produced by a collision and track how the kinetic
energy of the stream is dissipated by the associated shock. When the mass flow
rate of the stream $\dot{M}$ is a significant fraction of the Eddington
accretion rate, $\gtrsim2\%$ of the initial kinetic energy is converted to
radiation directly as a result of the collision. In this regime, the collision
redistributes the specific kinetic energy into the downstream gas and more than
$16\%$ of the mass can become unbound. The fraction of unbound gas decreases
rapidly as $\dot{M}$ drops significantly below the Eddington limit, with no
unbound gas being produced when $\dot{M}$ drops to $1\%$ of Eddington; we find
however that the radiative efficiency increases slightly to $\lesssim 8\%$ in
these low $\dot{M}$ cases. The effective radiation temperature and size of the
photosphere is determined by the stream velocity and $\dot{M}$, which we find
to be a few times $10^4$~K and $10^{14}$~cm in our calculations, comparable to
the inferred values of some TDE candidates. The photosphere size is directly
proportional to $\dot{M}$, which can explain the rapidly changing photosphere
sizes seen in TDE candidates such as PS1-10jh.

a best-fit rotational velocity of 183+/-41 km/s for an extended halo model.

  While the spiral density wave in M51 appears to influence the interstellar

the causal pathways through a large number of mediators, such as genetic and

estimate the pathway effects, commonly expressed as products of coefficients.
However, it becomes unstable to fit such models with high dimensional
mediators, especially for a general setting where all the mediators are
causally dependent but the exact causal relationships between them are unknown.
This paper proposes a sparse mediation model using a regularized SEM approach,
where sparsity here means that a small number of mediators have nonzero
mediation effects between a treatment and an outcome. To address the model
selection challenge, we innovate by introducing a new penalty called Pathway
Lasso. This penalty function is a convex relaxation of the non-convex product
function, and it enables a computationally tractable optimization criterion to
estimate and select many pathway effects simultaneously. We develop a fast
ADMM-type algorithm to compute the model parameters, and we show that the
iterative updates can be expressed in closed form. On both simulated data and a
real fMRI dataset, the proposed approach yields higher pathway selection
accuracy and lower estimation bias than other competing methods.

fragmentation in young protostellar disks, focusing on the fragments that are
ejected from the disk via many-body gravitational interaction. Numerical
hydrodynamics simulations were employed to study the evolution of young
protostellar disks formed from the collapse of rotating pre-stellar cores with
mass in the 1.1-1.6 M_sun range. Protostellar disks formed in our models
undergo gravitational fragmentation driven by continuing mass loading from
parental collapsing cores. A few fragments can be ejected from the disk during
the early evolution, but the low-mass fragments (< 15~M_Jup) disperse creating
spectacular bow-type structures while passing through the disk and collapsing
core. The least massive fragment that survived the ejection (21 M_Jup)
straddles the planetary-mass limit, while the most massive ejected fragments
(145 M_Jup) can break up into several pieces, leading to the ejection of wide
separation binary clumps in the brown-dwarf mass range. About half of the
ejected fragments are gravitationally bound, the majority is supported by
rotation against gravity, and all fragments have the specific angular momentum
that is much higher than that expected for brown dwarfs. We found that the
internal structure of the ejected fragments is distinct from what would be
expected for gravitationally contracting clumps formed via cloud core
fragmentation, which can help to differentiate their origin. The ejection of
fragments is an important process inherent to massive protostellar disks, which
produces freely-floating pre-brown dwarf cores, regulates the disk and stellar
masses, and potentially enriches the intracluster medium with processed dust
and complex organics.

yet one key facet of that activity is inherently invisible to the camera--the
wearer's body pose. Prior work focuses on estimating the pose of hands and arms
when they come into view, but this 1) gives an incomplete view of the full body
posture, and 2) prevents any pose estimate at all in many frames, since the
hands are only visible in a fraction of daily life activities. We propose to
infer the ""invisible pose"" of a person behind the egocentric camera. Given a
single video, our efficient learning-based approach returns the full body 3D
joint positions for each frame. Our method exploits cues from the dynamic
motion signatures of the surrounding scene--which changes predictably as a
function of body pose--as well as static scene structures that reveal the
viewpoint (e.g., sitting vs. standing). We further introduce a novel energy
minimization scheme to infer the pose sequence. It uses soft predictions of the
poses per time instant together with a non-parametric model of human pose
dynamics over longer windows. Our method outperforms an array of possible
alternatives, including deep learning approaches for direct pose regression

filters with respect to 3.5micron for simple and composite stellar populations,
and their dependence on age, metallicity and star formation history. UV/optical
light from stars is reddened and attenuated by dust, where different sightlines
across a galaxy suffer varying amounts of extinction. Tamura et al. (2009)
developed an approximate method to correct for dust extinction on a
pixel-by-pixel basis, dubbed the ""beta_V"" method, by comparing the observed
flux ratio to an empirical estimate of the intrinsic ratio of visible and
~3.5micron data. Through extensive modeling, we aim to validate the ""beta_V""
method for various filters spanning the visible through near-infrared
wavelength range, for a wide variety of simple and composite stellar
populations. Combining Starburst99 and BC03 models, we built spectral energy
distributions (SEDs) of simple (SSP) and composite (CSP) stellar populations
for various realistic star formation histories (SFHs), while taking metallicity
evolution into account. We convolve various 0.44--1.65micron filter throughput
curves with each model SED to obtain intrinsic flux ratios beta_{lam,0}. When
unconstrained in redshift, the total allowed range of beta_{V,0} is 0.6--4.7,
or almost a factor of eight. At known redshifts, and in particular at low
redshifts (z<0.01), beta_{V,0} is predicted to span a narrow range of 0.6--1.9,
especially for early-type galaxies (0.6--0.7), and is consistent with observed
beta_V values. The beta_lam method can therefore serve as a first-order dust
correction method for large galaxy surveys that combine JWST (rest-frame
3.5micron) and HST (rest-frame visible--near-IR) data.

a set of impressions arriving online are allocated to a set of
budget-constrained advertisers to maximize revenue. Motivated by connections to
Internet advertising, several variants of this problem have been studied since
the seminal work of Mehta, Saberi, Vazirani, and Vazirani (FOCS 2005). However,
this entire body of work focuses on a single budget for every advertising
campaign, whereas in order to fully represent the actual agenda of an
advertiser, an advertising budget should be expressible over multiple tiers of
user-attribute granularity. A simple example is an advertising campaign that is
constrained by an overall budget but is also accompanied by a set of
sub-budgets for each target demographic. In such a contract scheme, an
advertiser can specify their true user-targeting goals, allowing the publisher
to fulfill them through relevant allocations.
  In this paper, we give a complete characterization of the ADWORDS problem for
general advertising budgets. In the most general setting, we show that, unlike
in the single-budget ADWORDS problem, obtaining a constant competitive ratio is
impossible and give asymptotically tight upper and lower bounds. However for
our main result, we observe that in many real-world scenarios (as in the above
example), multi-tier budgets have a laminar structure, since most relevant
consumer or product classifications are hierarchical. For laminar budgets, we
obtain a competitive ratio of e/(e-1) in the small bids case, which matches the
best known ADWORDS result for single budgets. Our algorithm has a primal-dual
structure and generalizes the primal-dual analysis for single- budget ADWORDS
first given by Buchbinder, Jain, and Naor (ESA 2007).

drive, external force and nonlinearities. For weak parametric drive, the
response exhibits the standard Duffing-like single jump hysteresis. For
stronger drive amplitudes, we find a qualitatively new double jump hysteresis
which arises from stable solutions generated by the cubic Duffing nonlinearity.
The additional jump exists only if the external force is present and the
frequency at which it occurs depends linearly on the amplitude of the external
force, permitting a straightforward ultrasensitive detection of weak forces.
With state-of-the-art nanomechanical resonators, our scheme should permit force

these with a parametrization of projection operators which allow us to enforce

variations of power iteration. One, Forward Push, propagates probability mass
forwards along edges from a source node, while the other, Reverse Push,
propagates local changes backwards along edges from a target. In both
variations, we maintain an invariant between two vectors, and when an edge is
updated, our algorithm first modifies the vectors to restore the invariant,
then performs any needed local push operations to restore accuracy.
  For Reverse Push, we prove that for an arbitrary directed graph in a random

$\varepsilon$ as $k$ edges are updated is $O(k + \bar{d} / \varepsilon)$, where

present a study of the structure and dynamics of spiral arms driven in
interactions between disc galaxies and perturbing companions in 3-D
N-body/smoothed hydrodynamical numerical simulations. Our specific aims are to
characterize any differences between structures formed in the gas and stars
from a purely hydrodynamical and gravitational perspective, and to find a
limiting case for spiral structure generation. Through analysis of a number of
different interacting cases, we find that there is very little difference
between arm morphology, pitch angles and pattern speeds between the two media.
The main differences are a minor offset between gas and stellar arms, clear
spurring features in gaseous arms, and different radial migration of material
in the stronger interacting cases. We investigate the minimum mass of a
companion required to drive spiral structure in a galactic disc, finding the
limiting spiral generation cases with companion masses of the order
$1\times10^9M_\odot$, equivalent to only 4% of the stellar disc mass, or 0.5%
of the total galactic mass of a Milky Way analogue.

one-baryon systems and in heavy-light systems, we study relevance of
relativistic effects in hyperon-nucleon interactions with strangeness $S=-1$.
In this exploratory work, we follow the covariant framework developed by
Epelbaum and Gegelia to calculate the $YN$ scattering amplitude at leading
order. By fitting the five low-energy constants to the experimental data, we
find that the cutoff dependence is mitigated, compared with the heavy-baryon
approach. Nevertheless, the description of the experimental data remains
quantitatively similar at leading order.

charge pumping across the helical molecules by rotating the electric field in
the transverse plane and the pumped current at zero bias voltage is quantized.
In addition, the quantized current constitutes multiple plateaus by scanning
the Fermi energy as well as the bias voltage, and hold for various model

Integral Field Spectroscopy (IFS) from the CALIFA survey. Using O3N2 we found
no statistically significant differences between the gas-phase metallicities at
the locations of the three main SN types (Ia, Ib/c and II) all having
~8.50$\pm$0.02 dex. The total galaxy metallicities are also very similar and we
argue that this is because our sample consists only of SNe discovered in
massive galaxies (log(M/Msun)>10 dex) by targeted searches. We also found no
evidence that the metallicity at the SN location differs from the average
metallicity at the GCD of the SNe. By extending our SN sample with published
metallicities at the SN location, we studied the metallicity distributions for
all SN subtypes split into SN discovered in targeted and untargeted searches.
We confirm a bias toward higher host masses and metallicities in the targeted
searches. Combining data from targeted and untargeted searches we found a
sequence from higher to lower local metallicity: SN Ia, Ic, and II show the
highest metallicity, which is significantly higher than SN Ib, IIb, and Ic-BL.
Our results support the picture of SN Ib resulting from binary progenitors and,
at least part of, SN Ic being the result of single massive stars stripped of
their outer layers by metallicity driven winds. We studied several proxies of
the local metallicity frequently used in the literature and found that the
total host metallicity allows for the estimation of the metallicity at the SN
location with an accuracy better than 0.08 dex and very small bias. In
addition, weak AGNs not seen in total spectra may only weakly bias (by 0.04
dex) the metallicity estimate from integrated spectra. (abridged)

typically embedded in a feature-vector space, in which their distance preserve
the relative dissimilarity. However, when learning such similarity embeddings
the simplifying assumption is commonly made that images are only compared to
one unique measure of similarity. A main reason for this is that contradicting
notions of similarities cannot be captured in a single space. To address this
shortcoming, we propose Conditional Similarity Networks (CSNs) that learn
embeddings differentiated into semantically distinct subspaces that capture the
different notions of similarities. CSNs jointly learn a disentangled embedding
where features for different similarities are encoded in separate dimensions as
well as masks that select and reweight relevant dimensions to induce a subspace
that encodes a specific similarity notion. We show that our approach learns
interpretable image representations with visually relevant semantic subspaces.
Further, when evaluating on triplet questions from multiple similarity notions
our model even outperforms the accuracy obtained by training individual
specialized networks for each notion separately.

observational issues such as the survey geometry, masks of bright stars and
their spikes, and inhomogeneous noise, which distort the spectrum and also mix
the E-mode and the B-mode signals. Using ray-tracing simulations in N-body
simulations including realistic masks, we confirm that the pseudo-spectrum

investigate the covariance of the galaxy-shear cross spectrum using the
ray-tracing simulations to show that there is an excess covariance relative to
the Gaussian covariance at small scales where the shot noise is dominated in
the Gaussian approximation. We find that the excess of the covariance is
consistent with the expectation from the halo sample variance (HSV), which
originates from the matter fluctuations at scales larger than the survey area.
We apply the pseudo-spectrum method to the observational data of

three different spectroscopic samples of Sloan Digital Sky Survey Luminous Red

Longitudinal and transverse vibrations react with different speeds, indicating
a strong directionality and an important role of polar interactions. The hidden

introduction to further development of geometric tools in financial
applications such as risk or portfolio analysis. Indeed, risk and portfolio
analysis essentially rely on covariance matrices. Besides that the Gaussian
assumption is known to be inaccurate, covariance matrices are difficult to
estimate from empirical data. To filter noise from the empirical estimate,
Mantegna proposed using hierarchical clustering. In this work, we first show
that this procedure is statistically consistent. Then, we propose to use
clustering with a much broader application than the filtering of empirical
covariance matrices from the estimate correlation coefficients. To be able to
do that, we need to obtain distances between the financial time series that
incorporate all the available information in these cross-dependent random
processes.

the addition of rotation to the models modifies their original semiaxes ratios,

of the orbital content of the models shows that about two thirds of their
orbits are chaotic yet the models are very stable over intervals of the order
of one Hubble time. The bulk of regular orbits are short axis tubes, while long

show empty regions where studies of orbits on fixed potentials found orbits, a
likely consequence of the self-consistency of our models that excludes them.

In the United States, approximately $1 billion is lost per annum due to a

labor-intensive and time-consuming identification of Soybean Cyst Nematode

attempts to significantly expedite the process by using a series of manually
labeled microscopic images for training followed by automated high-throughput
egg detection. The problem is particularly difficult due to the presence of a
large population of non-egg particles (disturbances) in the image frames that
are very similar to SCN eggs in shape, pose and illumination. Therefore, the
selective autoencoder is trained to learn unique features related to the
invariant shapes and sizes of the SCN eggs without handcrafting. After that, a
composite non-maximum suppression and differencing is applied at the

as self-sustaining, large amplitude pressure oscillations and show varying
spatial scales periodic coherent vortex structure shedding. However, such
instability is extremely difficult to detect before a combustion process
becomes completely unstable due to its sudden (bifurcation-type) nature. In
this context, an autoencoder is trained to selectively mask stable flame and
allow unstable flame image frames. In that process, the model learns to
identify and extract rich descriptive and explanatory flame shape features.
With such a training scheme, the selective autoencoder is shown to be able to
detect subtle instability features as a combustion process makes transition
from stable to unstable region. As a consequence, the deep learning tool-chain
can perform as an early detection framework for combustion instabilities that
will have a transformative impact on the safety and performance of modern

$\widetilde{B}^{l}_{p,q,r}(\Omega,\{t_{k}\})$ on rough domains. A~domain~$G$ is
either a~bounded Lipschitz domain in~$\mathbb{R}^{n}$ or the epigraph of
a~Lipschitz function, a~domain~$\Omega$ is an $(\varepsilon,\delta)$-domain.
These spaces are shown to be the traces of the spaces
$B^{\varphi_{0}}_{p,q}(\mathbb{R}^{n},\{t_{k}\})$ and
$\widetilde{B}^{l}_{p,q,r}(\mathbb{R}^{n},\{t_{k}\})$ on domains $G$
and~$\Omega$, respectively. The extension operator
$\operatorname{Ext}_{1}:B^{\varphi_{0}}_{p,q}(G,\{t_{k}\}) \to
B^{\varphi_{0}}_{p,q}(\mathbb{R}^{n},\{t_{k}\})$ is linear, the operator
$\operatorname{Ext}_{2}:\widetilde{B}^{l}_{p,q,r}(\Omega,\{t_{k}\}) \to
\widetilde{B}^{l}_{p,q,r}(\mathbb{R}^{n},\{t_{k}\})$ is nonlinear. As
a~corollary, an exact description of the traces of 2-microlocal Besov-type
spaces and weighted Besov-type spaces on rough domains is obtained.

make the choice of the majority, while the rest want to make the minority

game theoretic aspect that agents try to optimize their own situation in ways
that are incompatible with the common good. When this fraction is less than
1/2, the population can efficiently self-organize to a state where agents get
what they want -- the majority (i.e. the majority seekers) have one opinion,
the minority seekers have the other. If the fraction is larger than 1/2, there
is a frustration in the population that dramatically changes the dynamics. In
this region, the population converges, through some distinct phases, to a state
of approximately equal-sized opinions. Just over the threshold the state of the
population is furthest from the collectively optimal solution.

the Bridge, the SCAD, and the MCP, allow us to estimate a parameter and to do
variable selection, simultaneously, if $\gamma\in (0,1]$. In this method, it is
important to choose a tuning parameter which controls the penalty level, since
we can select the model as we want when we choose it arbitrarily. Nowadays,
several information criteria have been developed to choose the tuning parameter
without such an arbitrariness. However the bias correction term of such
information criteria depend on the true parameter value in general, then we
usually plug-in a consistent estimator of it to compute the information
criteria from the data. In this paper, we derive a consistent estimator of the
bias correction term of the AIC for the non-concave penalized likelihood method
and propose a simple AIC-type information criterion for such models.

adopted in multimedia and other applications. One is usability, namely the
implementation of different models and training algorithms must be done by
non-experts without much effort especially when the model is large and complex.
The other is scalability, that is the deep learning system must be able to
provision for a huge demand of computing resources for training large models
with massive datasets. To address these two challenges, in this paper, we
design a distributed deep learning platform called SINGA which has an intuitive
programming model based on the common layer abstraction of deep learning
models. Good scalability is achieved through flexible distributed training
architecture and specific optimization techniques. SINGA runs on GPUs as well
as on CPUs, and we show that it outperforms many other state-of-the-art deep

In such dusty

systematically investigate effects of multiple scattering on extinction laws
for steady-emission sources surrounded by the dusty CS medium, using a
radiation transfer simulation based on the Monte Carlo technique. In
particular, we focus on whether and how the extinction properties are affected
by properties of CS dust grains, adopting various dust grain models. We {\bf
confirm} that behaviors of the (effective) extinction laws are highly dependent
on the properties of CS grains. Especially, the total-to-selective extinction
ratio $R_{V}$, which characterizes the extinction law, can be either increased
or decreased, compared to the case without multiple scattering. We find that
the criterion for this behavior is given by a ratio of albedos in the $B$ and
$V$ bands. We also find that either small silicate grains or polycyclic
aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) are necessary for realizing a low value of $R_{V}$
as often measured toward Type Ia supernovae, if the multiple scattering by CS
dust is responsible for their non-standard extinction laws. Using the derived
relations between the properties of dust grains and the resulting effective
extinction laws, we propose that the extinction laws toward dusty objects could
be used to constrain the properties of dust grains in CS environments.

devices. If such structures are illuminated by aperiodic time-harmonic incident
waves as, e.g., Gaussian beams, the resulting surface scattering problem must
be formulated in an unbounded layer including the periodic surface structure.
An obvious recipe to avoid the need to discretize this problem in an unbounded
domain is to set up an equivalent system of quasiperiodic scattering problems
in a single (bounded) periodicity cell via the Floquet-Bloch transform. The
solution to the original surface scattering problem then equals the inverse
Floquet-Bloch transform applied to the family of solutions to the quasiperiodic
problems, which simply requires to integrate these solutions in the
quasiperiodicity parameter. A numerical scheme derived from this representation
hence completely avoids the need to tackle differential equations on unbounded

bounds for such a scheme when applied to a two-dimensional model problem,
relying upon a quadrature-based approximation to the inverse Floquet-Bloch
transform and finite element approximations to quasiperiodic scattering

these symmetries may be appropriately called ""symplectic symmetries"". Existence
of residual diffeomorphisms and sympelctic symmetries can be a quite general
feature and not limited to the examples discussed so far in the literature. We
propose that, in the context of black holes, these diffeomorphic, but distinct,
geometries may be viewed as ""symplectic soft hair"" on black holes. We comment
on how this may remedy black hole microstate problem, which in this context are
dubbed as ""horizon fluffs"".

first-order and second-order type methods for composite convex programs. Our
key observations are: i) Many well-known operator splitting methods, such as
forward-backward splitting (FBS) and Douglas-Rachford splitting (DRS), actually
define a fixed-point mapping; ii) The optimal solutions of the composite convex
program and the solutions of a system of nonlinear equations derived from the
fixed-point mapping are equivalent. Solving this kind of system of nonlinear
equations enables us to develop second-order type methods. Although these
nonlinear equations may be non-differentiable, they are often semi-smooth and
their generalized Jacobian matrix is positive semidefinite due to monotonicity.
By combining with a regularization approach and a known hyperplane projection
technique, we propose an adaptive semi-smooth Newton method and establish its
convergence to global optimality. Preliminary numerical results on
$\ell_1$-minimization problems demonstrate that our second-order type
algorithms are able to achieve superlinear or quadratic convergence.

describe accurately the intricate behavior associated with black-hole

  Extraction of Semantics, Formation of Integrated Concepts and Re-selection
  Features for Ambiguity",,,,,"cs.CV cs.AI cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Integration between biology and information science benefits both fields.
Many related models have been proposed, such as computational visual cognition
models, computational motor control models, integrations of both and so on. In
general, the robustness and precision of recognition is one of the key problems
for object recognition models.
  In this paper, inspired by features of human recognition process and their
biological mechanisms, a new integrated and dynamic framework is proposed to
mimic the semantic extraction, concept formation and feature re-selection in
human visual processing. The main contributions of the proposed model are as
follows:
  (1) Semantic feature extraction: Local semantic features are learnt from
episodic features that are extracted from raw images through a deep neural
network;
  (2) Integrated concept formation: Concepts are formed with local semantic
information and structural information learnt through network.
  (3) Feature re-selection: When ambiguity is detected during recognition
process, distinctive features according to the difference between ambiguous
candidates are re-selected for recognition.
  Experimental results on hand-written digits and facial shape dataset show
that, compared with other methods, the new proposed model exhibits higher
robustness and precision for visual recognition, especially in the condition
when input samples are smantic ambiguous. Meanwhile, the introduced biological
mechanisms further strengthen the interaction between neuroscience and
information science.

  the influence of bathymetry on tsunami heights","26 pages, 8 figures, 2 tables",,,,"stat.CO stat.AP","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  High accuracy complex computer models, or simulators, require large resources
in time and memory to produce realistic results. Statistical emulators are
computationally cheap approximations of such simulators. They can be built to
replace simulators for various purposes, such as the propagation of
uncertainties from inputs to outputs or the calibration of some internal
parameters against observations. However, when the input space is of high
dimension, the construction of an emulator can become prohibitively expensive.
In this paper, we introduce a joint framework merging emulation with dimension
reduction in order to overcome this hurdle. The gradient-based kernel dimension
reduction technique is chosen due to its ability to drastically decrease
dimensionality with little loss in information. The Gaussian process emulation
technique is combined with this dimension reduction approach. Our proposed
approach provides an answer to the dimension reduction issue in emulation for a
wide range of simulation problems that cannot be tackled using existing
methods. The efficiency and accuracy of the proposed framework is demonstrated
theoretically, and compared with other methods on an elliptic partial
differential equation (PDE) problem. We finally present a realistic application
to tsunami modeling. The uncertainties in the bathymetry (seafloor elevation)
are modeled as high-dimensional realizations of a spatial process using a
geostatistical approach. Our dimension-reduced emulation enables us to compute
the impact of these uncertainties on resulting possible tsunami wave heights
near-shore and on-shore. We observe a significant increase in the spread of
uncertainties in the tsunami heights due to the contribution of the bathymetry
uncertainties. These results highlight the need to include the effect of
uncertainties in the bathymetry in tsunami early warnings and risk assessments.

2015. Suzaku X-ray telescope serendipitously captured the onset of the outburst

paper, we present temporal and spectral analysis results of this outburst,
together with those from archival data of quiescent obtained in 2009 and 2014.
  Our temporal analysis confirmed previously reported spin modulation of X-ray
count rates in outburst with a WD spin period of P_WD=351.4+/-0.5 s. The
modulation is also detected in the hard X-ray band (16-60 keV), and spectral
modeling of the absorption suggests obscuration by a dense absorption with a
line-of-sight column density of N_H>10^23 cm^-2. A complex time evolution of
spin modulation profiles is seen; the spin minimum phase shifts from phase
~0.25 in the first half of the observation to ~0.65 in the second one, and the
pulse shape significantly changes epoch by epoch.
  Spectral fitting in the Fe Kalpha band revealed an increase of the
fluorescent line equivalent width, from ~80 eV (quiescent) to ~140 eV
(outburst). The equivalent widths of He-like and H-like Fe Kalpha are
consistent with being constant at ~40 eV in the two states. Broad-band spectral
fitting in the 2-60 keV band resulted in a sub-solar Fe abundance of ~0.1 Z_sun
and the maximum plasma temperature kT_max~50-60 keV when the isobaric cooling
flow model was applied. Based on the very small temperature change against a
6-7-times increased accretion rate, the accretion geometry in early outburst is
discussed.

(${\nabla}^2 E_a {\approx} 10^{10} \frac{V}{m^2}$ ) using a high voltage (20
kV) point-plane electrode system. With interferometry it was found that the
application of a strong electric field gradient to water generates local
changes in the refractive index of the liquid, polarizes the surface and
creates a downward moving electro-convective jet. A maximum temperature
difference of 1 {\deg}C is measured in the immediate vicinity of the point
electrode. Raman spectroscopy on water reveals an enhancement of the
vibrational collective modes (3250 $cm^{-1}$) as well as an increase in the
local mode (3490 $cm^{-1}$) energy. This bimodal enhancement indicates the
spectral changes are not due to temperature. The intense field gradient thus
establishes an excited subpopulation of vibrational oscillators far from
thermal equilibrium. Delocalization of the collective vibrational mode
spatially expands this excited population beyond the microscale. Hindered
rotational freedom due to electric field pinning of molecular dipoles retards
heat flow and generates a chemical potential gradient. These changes are
responsible for the observed changes in refractive index and temperature. It is
demonstrated that polar liquids can thus support local non-equilibrium
thermodynamic transient states critical to biochemical and environmental
processes.

It is based on the analysis of the background acoustic noise, supposed to be a
diffuse field. The proposed strategy is a two-step process. First the pairwise
microphone distances are identified by matching their measured coherence
function to the one predicted by the diffuse field theory. Second, a robust
multidimensional scaling(MDS) algorithm is adapted and implemented. It takes
advantage of local characteristics to reduce the set of distances and infer the
geometry of the array. This work is an extension of previous studies, and it
overcomes unsolved drawbacks. In particular it deals efficiently with the

promising for emerging applications in nanophotonics. Here, we report on the
extraordinary spatial non-uniformity of the photoluminescence (PL) and strain

it is shown that the edges of such monolayers exhibit remarkably enhanced PL

non-uniformity across the monolayer's surface and reflects on the
non-uniformity of the intrinsic electron density across the monolayer. Auger
electron imaging and spectroscopy studies complemented with PL measurements in
different environments indicate that oxygen chemisorption and physisorption are
the two fundamental mechanisms responsible for the observed non-uniformity. At
the same time Raman spectroscopy analysis shows remarkable strain variations
among the different locations of an individual monolayer, however such
variations cannot be strictly correlated with the non-uniform PL emission. Our
results shed light on the role of the chemical bonding on the competition
between exciton complexes in monolayer WS2, providing a way of engineering new
nanophotonic functions using WS2 monolayers. It is therefore envisaged that our
findings could find diverse applications towards the development of TMDs-based

XML-based protocols are susceptible to entire classes of implicit and explicit
security problems. Message formats in XML-based protocols are usually specified
in XML Schema, and as a first-line defense, schema validation should reject
malformed input. However, extension points in most protocol specifications
break validation. Extension points are wildcards and considered best practice
for loose composition, but they also enable an attacker to add unchecked
content in a document, e.g., for a signature wrapping attack.
  This paper introduces datatyped XML visibly pushdown automata (dXVPAs) as
language representation for mixed-content XML and presents an incremental
learner that infers a dXVPA from example documents. The learner generalizes XML
types and datatypes in terms of automaton states and transitions, and an
inferred dXVPA converges to a good-enough approximation of the true language.
The automaton is free from extension points and capable of stream validation,
e.g., as an anomaly detector for XML-based protocols. For dealing with
adversarial training data, two scenarios of poisoning are considered: a
poisoning attack is either uncovered at a later time or remains hidden.
Unlearning can therefore remove an identified poisoning attack from a dXVPA,
and sanitization trims low-frequent states and transitions to get rid of hidden
attacks. All algorithms have been evaluated in four scenarios, including a web
service implemented in Apache Axis2 and Apache Rampart, where attacks have been
simulated. In all scenarios, the learned automaton had zero false positives and
outperformed traditional schema validation.

narrow emission lines and were confirmed to host binary AGNs with follow up

diverse morphological types. There are three major mergers with intermediate
morphologies and a minor merger with a dominant disk component. We estimate the
masses of the SMBHs from their host bulge stellar masses and obtain Eddington
ratios for each AGN. Compared with a representative control sample drawn at the
same redshift and stellar mass, the AGN luminosities and Eddington ratios of
our binary AGNs are similar to those of single AGNs. The U-Y color maps
indicate that clumpy star forming regions could significantly affect the X-ray
detection of binary AGNs, e.g., the hardness ratio. Considering the weak X-ray
emission in AGNs triggered in merger systems, we suggest that samples of X-ray
selected AGNs may be biased against gas-rich mergers.

representation of the gauge group which - by adding a suitable Chern-Simons
term to the particle action - can be projected onto a chosen fully
(anti-)symmetric representation. By considering F families of auxiliary
variables, we describe how to extend the model to arbitrary tensor products of
F reducible representations, which realises a U(F) ""flavour"" symmetry on the
worldline particle model. Gauging this symmetry allows the introduction of
constraints on the Hilbert space of the colour fields which can be used to
project onto an arbitrary irreducible representation, specified by a certain
Young Tableau. In particular the occupation numbers of the wavefunction - i.e.
the lengths of the columns (rows) of the Young Tableau - are fixed through the
introduction of Chern-Simons terms. We verify this projection by calculating
the number of colour degrees of freedom associated to the matter field. We

equisingular moduli of a rational surface singularity, and prove it in some
natural special cases. When the resolution dual graph is ""sufficiently
negative"" (in a precise sense), we verify the inequality via an easy
cohomological vanishing theorem, which implies that this number is computed
simply from the graph (Theorem 3.10). To consider an important and less
restrictive meaning of ""sufficiently negative"" requires a much more difficult
""hard vanishing theorem"" (Theorem 4.5), which is false in characteristic p.
Theorem 7.9 verifies the conjectured inequality in this more general situation.
As a corollary, we classify in characteristic p all taut singularities with
reduced fundamental cycle (Theorem 9.2).

that OptEx yields a mean relative error of 6% in estimating the job completion

spontaneous symmetry breaking, i.e. from the nonlinear dynamics of the system.
The dynamics of phase differences for such a system depends only on the
coupling (phase interaction) function $g(\varphi)$ and the number of
oscillators $N$. This paper briefly reviews some results for such systems in
the case of general coupling $g$ before exploring two cases in detail: (a)
general two harmonic form:
$g(\varphi)=q\sin(\varphi-\alpha)+r\sin(2\varphi-\beta)$ and $N$ small (b) the
coupling $g$ is odd or even. We extend previously published bifurcation
analyses to the general two harmonic case, and show for even $g$ that the
dynamics of phase differences has a number of time-reversal symmetries. For the
case of even $g$ with one harmonic it is known the system has $N-2$ constants
of the motion. This is true for $N=4$ and any $g$, while for $N=4$ and more
than two harmonics in $g$, we show the system must have fewer independent

burdened with the choice of a suitable client-centric consistency setting for
each storage operation. The above matching choice is difficult to reason about
as it requires deliberating about the tradeoff between the latency and
staleness, i.e., how stale (old) the result is. The latency and staleness for a
given operation depend on the client-centric consistency setting applied, as
well as dynamic parameters such as the current workload and network
condition.We present OptCon, a novel machine learning-based predictive
framework, that can automate the choice of client-centric consistency setting
under user-specified latency and staleness thresholds given in the service
level agreement (SLA). Under a given SLA, OptCon predicts a client-centric
consistency setting that is matching, i.e., it is weak enough to satisfy the
latency threshold, while being strong enough to satisfy the staleness
threshold. While manually tuned consistency settings remain fixed unless
explicitly reconfigured, OptCon tunes consistency settings on a per-operation
basis with respect to changing workload and network state. Using decision tree
learning, OptCon yields 0.14 cross validation error in predicting matching
consistency settings under latency and staleness thresholds given in the SLA.
We demonstrate experimentally that OptCon is at least as effective as any
manually chosen consistency settings in adapting to the SLA thresholds for
different use cases. We also demonstrate that OptCon adapts to variations in
workload, whereas a given manually chosen fixed consistency setting satisfies
the SLA only for a characteristic workload.

gracefully with the level of the hierarchy. This hierarchy is a refinement of
the Maximum over Positive Hypergraphs (MPH) hierarchy [FFIILS15], where the

the formation of a gaseous proto-cluster inside a molecular cloud by performing
high resolution MHD simulations and associate its internal properties to those
of the parent cloud by varying the level of the initial turbulence of the
cloud, with a view to better characterize the subsequent stellar cluster
formation. The gaseous proto-cluster is formed out of global collapse of a
molecular cloud, and has non-negligible rotation due to angular momentum
conservation during the collapse of the object. Most of the star formation
occurs in this region which occupies only a small volume fraction of the whole
cloud. We identify such regions in simulations and compare the gas and sink
particles to observations. The gaseous proto-cluster inferred from simulation
results present a mass-size relation that is compatible with observations. We
stress that the stellar cluster radius, although clearly correlated with the
gas cluster radius, depends sensitively on its definition. Energy analysis is
performed to confirm that the gaseous proto-cluster is a product of
gravo-turbulent reprocessing and that the support of turbulent and rotational
energy against self-gravity yields a state of global virial equilibrium
although collapse is occurring at smaller scale and the cluster is forming
stars actively. This object then serves as the antecedent of the stellar
cluster, to which the energy properties are passed on.

faced by current state-of-the-art Monte Carlo radiative transfer codes: the
generation of photon packages from multiple components, and the penetration of
radiation through high optical depth barriers. In both cases, the
implementation of the relevant algorithms is trivial and does not interfere
with any other optimisation techniques. Through simple test models, we
demonstrate the general applicability, accuracy and efficiency of the composite
biasing approach. In particular, for the penetration of high optical depths,
the gain in efficiency is spectacular for the specific problems that we
consider: in simulations with composite path length stretching, high accuracy
results are obtained even for simulations with modest numbers of photon
packages, while simulations without biasing cannot reach convergence, even with
a huge number of photon packages.

water gauge were also analyzed to see the fluctuations.
  We identified three types of hydrodynamic relationships with fairly low flow
gradients: effluent flow at Segmen I (Kranggan - Batuceper) with 0.2-0.25
gradient, perched flow at Segmen II (Batuceper-Kalibaru) with gradient
0.2-0.25, and influent flow at Segmen III (Kalibaru-Tanjungburung) with
gradient 0.15-0.20. Such low flow gradient is controlled by the moderate to low
morphological slope in the area. The gaining and losing stream model were also
supported by the river water fluctuation data. TDS and EC readings increased
more than 40$\%$ from upstream to downstream. At some points the both
measurements were two times higher than the permissible limits, along with the
drops of pH values at those areas.
  This study shows the very close interaction between Cisadane river water and

  correlations","5 pages, 8 figues, 1 table",,,,"cs.IR cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Movie ratings play an important role both in determining the likelihood of a
potential viewer to watch the movie and in reflecting the current viewer
satisfaction with the movie. They are available in several sources like the
television guide, best-selling reference books, newspaper columns, and
television programs. Furthermore, movie ratings are crucial for recommendation
engines that track the behavior of all users and utilize the information to
suggest items they might like. Movie ratings in most cases, thus, provide
information that might be more important than movie feature-based data. It is
intuitively appealing that information about the viewing preferences in movie
genres is sufficient for predicting a genre of an unlabeled movie. In order to
predict movie genres, we treat ratings as a feature vector, apply the Bernoulli
event model to estimate the likelihood of a movies given genre, and evaluate
the posterior probability of the genre of a given movie using the Bayes rule.
The goal of the proposed technique is to efficiently use the movie ratings for
the task of predicting movie genres. In our approach we attempted to answer the
question: ""Given the set of users who watched a movie, is it possible to
predict the genre of a movie based on its ratings?"" Our simulation results with
MovieLens 100k data demonstrated the efficiency and accuracy of our proposed
technique, achieving 59% prediction rate for exact prediction and 69% when
including correlated genres.
