$\mathfrak S$ can be represented as the reachable set of a Loewner - Kufarev -

the essence of Loewner's well-known Parametric Representation of univalent

conformal self-maps defined by their boundary regular fixed points and, in part

transitive tournament by reversing each edge independently with probability
$p$. We show that for $p=\Theta(\frac 1n)$ the chromatic number of a $p$-random

challenging problems that are derived from the finite depth of field in
conventional cameras. Coded aperture imaging is one of the techniques that is
used for improving the results of these two problems. Up to now, different
methods have been proposed for improving the results of either defocus
deblurring or depth estimation. In this paper, a multi-objective function is
proposed for evaluating and designing aperture patterns with the aim of
improving the results of both depth from defocus and defocus deblurring.
Pattern evaluation is performed by considering the scene illumination condition
and camera system specification. Based on the proposed criteria, a single
asymmetric pattern is designed that is used for restoring a sharp image and a
depth map from a single input. Since the designed pattern is asymmetric,
defocus objects on the two sides of the focal plane can be distinguished. Depth
estimation is performed by using a new algorithm, which is based on image
quality assessment criteria and can distinguish between blurred objects lying
in front or behind the focal plane. Extensive simulations as well as
experiments on a variety of real scenes are conducted to compare our aperture
with previously proposed ones.

magnetoresistance, Hall and thermoelectric coefficients of Nernst and Seebeck

coincident with a Lifshitz transition, corresponding to the formation of unique
electron-hole-electron ($e$-$h$-$e$) pockets along the $I-L-I'$ direction.
First-principles calculations reveal that, along the $I-L-I'$ line, the
$d_{xy}$ and $d_{x^{2}-y^{2}}$ orbitals of the transition metal form tilted
nodal rings of band crossing well below the Fermi level. Strong spin-orbital
coupling gaps all the crossing points and creates the characteristic
$e$-$h$-$e$ structure, making MPn$_{2}$ a topological semimetal with
$\mathbb{Z}_2$ indices of [0;(111)]. By excluding the weak localization
contribution of the bulk states, we conclude that the universal NMR in
MPn$_{2}$ may have an exotic origin in topological surface states, which
appears in pairs with opposite spin-momentum locking on nontrivial surfaces.

to learn about the structure of subhalos with masses 1e6 - 1e11 Msun/h. Thanks
to a superb subhalo statistics, we study subhalo properties as a function of
distance to host halo center and subhalo mass, and provide a set of fits that
accurately describe the subhalo structure. We also investigate the role of
subhalos on the search for DM annihilation. Previous work has shown that
subhalos are expected to boost the DM signal of their host halos significantly.
Yet, these works traditionally assumed that subhalos exhibit similar structural
properties than those of field halos, while it is known that subhalos are more
concentrated. Building upon our N-body data analysis, we refine the
substructure boost model of Sanchez-Conde & Prada (2014), and find boosts that
are a factor 2-3 higher. We further refine the model to include unavoidable
tidal stripping effects on the subhalo population. For field halos, this
introduces a moderate 20-30% suppression. Yet, for subhalos like those hosting
dwarf galaxy satellites, tidal stripping plays a critical role, the boost being
at the level of a few tens of percent at most. We provide a parametrization of
the boost for field halos that can be safely applied over a wide halo mass

photosynthetically active mesophyll cells into the phloem down its
concentration gradient via plasmodesmata, i.e., symplastically. In some of
these plants the process is entirely passive, but in others phloem sucrose is
actively converted into larger sugars, raffinose and stachyose, and segregated
(trapped), thus raising total phloem sugar concentration to a level higher than
in the mesophyll. Questions remain regarding the mechanisms and selective
advantages conferred by both of these symplastic loading processes. Here we
present an integrated model - including local and global transport and the
kinetics of oligomerization - for passive and active symplastic loading. We
also propose a physical model of transport through the plasmodesmata. With
these models, we predict that: 1) relative to passive loading, oligomerization
of sucrose in the phloem, even in the absence of segregation, lowers the sugar
content in the leaf required to achieve a given export rate and accelerates
export for a given concentration of sucrose in the mesophyll; and 2)
segregation of oligomers and the inverted gradient of total sugar content can
be achieved for physiologically reasonable parameter values, but even higher
export rates can be accessed in scenarios in which polymers are allowed to
diffuse back into the mesophyll. We discuss these predictions in relation to
further studies aimed at the clarification of loading mechanisms, fitness of
active and passive symplastic loading, and potential targets for engineering
improved rates of export.

coverings between topological spheres, and extend this correspondence to maps

ground-state exchange-correlation energies of the hydrogen atom and many other
1- and 2-electron systems are modeled surprisingly well by a different local
spin density approximation (LSDA0). Our LSDA0 is constructed to satisfy exact
constraints, but agrees surprisingly well with the exact results for a uniform
two-electron density in a finite, curved three-dimensional space. We also apply
LSDA0 to excited or noded 1-electron densities. Furthermore, we show that the
locality of an orbital can be measured by the ratio between the exact exchange
energy and its optimal lower bound.

resolution with the Chandra HETGS, revealing a spectrum rich with blueshifted
absorption lines indicative of an accretion disk wind -- apparently too hot,
too dense, and too close to the black hole to be driven by radiation pressure
or thermal pressure (Miller et al.). But this exotic wind represents just one
piece of the puzzle in this outburst, as its presence coincides with an
extremely soft and curved X-ray continuum spectrum, remarkable X-ray
variability (Uttley & Klein-Wolt), and a bright, unexpected optical/infrared
blackbody component that varies on the orbital period. Focusing on the X-ray
continuum and the optical/infrared/UV spectral energy distribution, we argue
that the unusual features of this ""hypersoft state"" are natural consequences of
a super-Eddington Compton-thick wind from the disk: the optical/infrared
blackbody represents the cool photosphere of a dense, extended outflow, while
the X-ray emission is explained as Compton scattering by the relatively cool,
optically thick wind. This wind obscures the intrinsic luminosity of the inner
disk, which we suggest may have been at or above the Eddington limit.

Optimized Schwarz methods (OSM) form a class of Schwarz methods that are

a two-subdomain case, OSM is a natural solver for hybridizable discontinuous
Galerkin (HDG) discretizations of elliptic PDEs. In this paper, we generalize
the preceding result to the many-subdomain case and obtain sharp convergence
rates with respect to the mesh size and polynomial degree, the subdomain

Ultrahigh Energy Cosmic Ray (UHECR) protons interact with the Cosmic Microwave

$10\mbox{MeV}\mbox{-}1\mbox{TeV}$ that contribute to the EGRB flux. We examine
seven possible evolution models for UHECRs and find that UHECR sources that
evolve as the Star Formation Rate (SFR), medium low luminosity active galactic
nuclei type-1 ($L = 10^{43.5}\mbox{erg sec}^{-1}$ in the
$[0.5\mbox{-}2]\mbox{KeV}$ band), and BL Lacertae objects (BL Lacs) are the
most acceptable given the constraints imposed by the observed EGRB. Other
possibilities produce too much secondary $\gamma$-radiation. In all cases, the
decaying dark matter contribution improves the fit at high energy, but the
contribution of still unresolved blazars, which would leave the smallest role
for decaying dark matter, may yet provide an alternative improvement.
  The possibility that the entire EGRB can be fitted with resolvable but
not-yet-resolved blazars, as recently claimed by Ajello et al. (2015), would
leave little room in the EGRB to accommodate $\gamma$-rays from extragalactic
UHECR production, even for many source evolution rates that would otherwise be
acceptable. We find that, under the assumption of UHECRs being mostly protons,
there is not enough room for producing extragalactic UHECRs with AGN, GRB, or
even SFR source evolution. Sources that evolve as BL Lacs on the other hand,
would produce much less secondary $\gamma$-radiation and would remain a viable
source of UHECRs, provided that they dominate.

of today with new service innovations driven by increasing data traffic demand,
increasing processing power of smart devices and new innovative applications.
To meet these service demands the telecommunications industry is converging on
a common set of 5G requirements which includes network speeds as high as 10
Gbps, cell edge rate greater than 100 Mbps, and latency of less than 1 msec. To
reach these 5G requirements the industry is looking at new spectrum bands in
the range up to 100 GHz where there is spectrum availability for wide bandwidth
channels. For the development of new 5G systems to operate in bands up to 100
GHz there is a need for accurate radio propagation models which are not
addressed by existing channel models developed for bands below 6 GHz. This
paper presents a preliminary overview of the 5G channel models for bands up to
100 GHz in indoor offices and shopping malls, derived from extensive
measurements across a multitude of bands. These studies have found some
extensibility of the existing 3GPP models to the higher frequency bands up to
100 GHz. The measurements indicate that the smaller wavelengths introduce an
increased sensitivity of the propagation models to the scale of the environment
and show some frequency dependence of the path loss as well as increased
occurrence of blockage. Further, the penetration loss is highly dependent on
the material and tends to increase with frequency. The small-scale
characteristics of the channel such as delay spread and angular spread and the
multipath richness is somewhat similar over the frequency range, which is
encouraging for extending the existing 3GPP models to the wider frequency
range. Further work will be carried out to complete these models, but this
paper presents the first steps for an initial basis for the model development.

We use a time multiplexing approach to achieve 8192 (8k) virtual STDP adaptors
and decay generators with only one physical implementation of each. We have
validated our stochastic STDP approach with measurement results of a balanced
excitation/inhibition experiment. Our stochastic approach is ideal for
implementing the STDP learning rule in large-scale spiking neural networks

one that is initially radiation pressure dominated and expected to be thermally
unstable and another that is initially gas-pressure dominated and expected to
remain stable. Indeed, we find that cooling dominates over heating in the
radiation pressure dominated model, causing the disc to collapse vertically on
roughly the local cooling timescale. We also find that heating and cooling
within the disc have a different dependence on the mid-plane pressure, a
prerequisite of thermal instability. Comparison of our data with the relevant
thin-disc thermal equilibrium curve suggests that our disc may be headed for
the thermally stable, gas-pressure-dominated branch. However, because the disc
collapses to the point that we are no longer able to resolve it, we had to
terminate the simulation. On the other hand, the gas pressure dominated model,
which was run for twice as long as the radiation pressure dominated one,
remains stable, with heating and cooling roughly in balance. Finally, the
radiation pressure dominated simulation shows some evidence of viscous
instability. The strongest evidence is in plots of surface density, which show
the disc breaking up into rings.

zero-vorticity (fundamental) solitons and ones carrying vorticity S = 1 are
considered. Physical realizations of multidimensional solitons in atomic
Bose-Einstein condensates (BECs) and nonlinear optics are briefly discussed
too. Unlike 1D solitons, which are typically stable, 2D and 3D ones are
vulnerable to instabilities induced by the occurrence of the critical and
supercritical collapse, respectively, in the same 2D and 3D models that give
rise to the solitons. Vortex solitons are subject to a still stronger splitting
instability. For this reason, a central problem is search for physical settings
in which 2D and 3D solitons may be stabilized. The brief review addresses one
well-established topic, viz., the stabilization of the 3D and 2D states, with S
= 0 and 1, trapped in harmonic-oscillator (HO) potentials, and another topic
which was developed very recently: the stabilization of 2D and 3D free-space
solitons, which juxtapose components with S = 0 and (+/-)1 (semi-vortices and
mixed modes), in a binary system with the spin-orbit coupling (SOC) between its
components. The former model is based on the single cubic nonlinear
Schroedinger/Gross-Pitaevskii equation (NLSE/GPE), while the latter one is
represented by a system of two coupled GPEs. In both cases, generic situations
are drastically different in the 2D and 3D geometries. In the 2D settings, the
stabilization mechanism creates a stable ground state (GS, which was absent
without the stabilization), whose norm falls below the threshold value at which
the critical collapse sets in. In the 3D geometry, the supercritical collapse
does not allow to create a GS, but metastable solitons can be constructed.

selection, IRDCs represent only a fraction of the Galactic clouds capable of
forming massive stars and star clusters. Due to their low dust temperatures,
IRDCs are bright in the far-IR and millimeter and thus, observations at these
wavelengths have the potential to provide a complete sample of star-forming
massive clouds across the Galaxy. Our aim is to identify the clouds at the
initial conditions of massive star formation across the Galaxy and compare
their physical properties as a function of their Galactic location. We have
examined the physical properties of a homogeneous galactic cold core sample

Herschel Hi-GAL observations, we have characterized the internal structure of
them. By using background-subtracted Herschel images, we have derived the H2
column density and dust temperature maps for 48 Planck clumps. Their basic
physical parameters have been calculated and analyzed as a function of location

relation for massive star formation derived by Kauffmann & Pillai (2010). Most

barrier between graphene and BP determines charge transport at high
temperatures and positive gate voltages, whereas tunneling dominates at low
temperatures and negative gate voltages. These results elucidate out-of-plane
electronic transport in BP, and thus have implications for the design and
operation of BP-based van der Waals heterostructures.

$\sqrt{\frac{1-p}{p}} X(t)$, where $X$ is a doubly perturbed Brownian motion,

subspaces}, i.e.\ globally fixed subspaces in Euclidean space $\mathbb{R}^d$, a
\emph{pinned subspace-incidence system} is the pair $(H, Q)$, with the
constraint that each pinning subspace in $Q$ is contained in the subspace
spanned by the point realizations in $\mathbb{R}^d$ of vertices of the
corresponding hyperedge of $H$. This paper provides a combinatorial
characterization of pinned subspace-incidence systems that are \emph{minimally
rigid}, i.e.\ those systems that are guaranteed to generically yield a locally
unique realization.
  Pinned subspace-incidence systems have applications in the \emph{Dictionary
Learning (aka sparse coding)} problem, i.e.\ the problem of obtaining a sparse
representation of a given set of data vectors by learning \emph{dictionary
vectors} upon which the data vectors can be written as sparse linear
combinations. Viewing the dictionary vectors from a geometry perspective as the
spanning set of a subspace arrangement, the result gives a tight bound on the
number of dictionary vectors for sufficiently randomly chosen data vectors, and
gives a way of constructing a dictionary that meets the bound. For less
stringent restrictions on data, but a natural modification of the dictionary
learning problem, a further dictionary learning algorithm is provided. Although
there are recent rigidity based approaches for low rank matrix completion, we
are unaware of prior application of combinatorial rigidity techniques in the
setting of Dictionary Learning. We also provide a systematic classification of
problems related to dictionary learning together with various algorithms, their

by GPS-enabled devices such as vehicles navigation systems and mobile phones.
GPS trajectory data is useful for applications such as traffic management,
location forecasting, and itinerary planning. Such applications often need to
extract the time-stamped Sequence of Visited Locations (SVLs) of the mobile
objects. The nearest neighbor query (NNQ) is the most applied method for
labeling the visited locations based on the IDs of the POIs in the process of
SVL generation. NNQ in some scenarios is not accurate enough. To improve the
quality of the extracted SVLs, instead of using NNQ, we label the visited
locations as the IDs of the POIs which geometrically intersect with the GPS
observations. Intersection operator requires the accurate geometry of the
points of interest which we refer to them as the Geometries of Interest (GOIs).
In some application domains (e.g. movement trajectories of animals), adequate
information about the POIs and their GOIs may not be available a priori, or
they may not be publicly accessible and, therefore, they need to be derived
from GPS trajectory data. In this paper we propose a novel method for
estimating the POIs and their GOIs, which consists of three phases: (i)
extracting the geometries of the stay regions; (ii) constructing the geometry
of destination regions based on the extracted stay regions; and (iii)
constructing the GOIs based on the geometries of the destination regions. Using
the geometric similarity to known GOIs as the major evaluation criterion, the
experiments we performed using long-term GPS trajectory data show that our
method outperforms the existing approaches.

training and deployment of image classification models, particularly under the
scenarios of many image categories and high feature dimensions. As a defining
property, our method represents both the images and learned classifiers using
binary hash codes, which are simultaneously learned from the training data.
Classifying an image thereby reduces to computing the Hamming distance between
the binary codes of the image and classifiers and selecting the class with
minimal Hamming distance. Conventionally, compact hash codes are primarily used
for accelerating image search. Our work is first of its kind to represent
classifiers using binary codes. Specifically, we formulate multi-class image
classification as an optimization problem over binary variables. The
optimization alternatively proceeds over the binary classifiers and image hash
codes. Profiting from the special property of binary codes, we show that the
sub-problems can be efficiently solved through either a binary quadratic
program (BQP) or linear program. In particular, for attacking the BQP problem,
we propose a novel bit-flipping procedure which enjoys high efficacy and local
optimality guarantee. Our formulation supports a large family of empirical loss
functions and is here instantiated by exponential / hinge losses. Comprehensive
evaluations are conducted on several representative image benchmarks. The
experiments consistently observe reduced complexities of model training and

HVC is organized into FSUs, each of which provides the basis for the production
of one syllable in vocalization. Within each FSU, the inhibitory neuron
population takes one of two operational states: (A) simultaneous firing wherein
all inhibitory neurons fire simultaneously, and (B) competitive firing of the
inhibitory neurons. Switching between these basic modes of activity is
accomplished via changes in the synaptic strengths among the inhibitory
neurons. The inhibitory neurons connect to excitatory projection neurons such
that during state (A) the activity of projection neurons is suppressed, while
during state (B) patterns of sequential firing of projection neurons can occur.
The latter state is stabilized by feedback from the projection to the
inhibitory neurons. Song composition for specific species is distinguished by
the manner in which different FSUs are functionally connected to each other.
  Ours is a computational model built with biophysically based neurons. We
illustrate that many observations of HVC activity are explained by the dynamics
of the proposed population of FSUs, and we identify aspects of the model that
are currently testable experimentally. In addition, and standing apart from the
core features of an FSU, we propose that the transition between modes may be
governed by the biophysical mechanism of neuromodulation.

nano-contact (NC) spin torque oscillators, can merge into a single droplet
soliton. A detailed description of the magnetization dynamics of this merger
process is obtained by micromagnetic simulations: A droplet pair with a
steady-state in-phase spin precession is generated through the spin-transfer
torque effect underneath two separate NCs, followed by a gradual expansion of
the droplets volume and the out phase of magnetization on the inner side of the
two droplets, resulting in the droplets merging into a larger droplet. This
merger occurs only when the NC separation is smaller than a critical value. A
transient breathing mode is observed before the merged droplet stabilizes into
a steady precession state. The precession frequency of the merged droplet is
lower than that of the droplet pair, consistent with its larger size. Merged
droplets can again break up into droplet pairs at high enough magnetic field
with a strong hysteretic response.

segmenting data into respective subspaces --- subspace clustering --- finds
widespread applications in computer vision, including co-segmentation.
State-of-the-art methods via subspace clustering seek to solve the problem in
two steps:
  First, an affinity matrix is built from data, with appearance features or
motion patterns. Second, the data are segmented by applying spectral clustering
to the affinity matrix. However, this process is insufficient to obtain an
optimal solution since it does not take into account the {\em interdependence}

constraint in order to make it more suitable to segment rigid motions lying in
affine subspaces of dimension at most $3$. Our experiments on MOViCS dataset

find that the Lifshitz dynamical exponent $z$ contributes evidently to magnetic
moment and hysteresis loop of single magnetic domain quantitatively not
qualitatively. Concretely, in the case without external magnetic field, the
spontaneous magnetization and ferromagnetic phase transition happen when the
temperature gets low enough, and the critical exponent for the magnetic moment
is always $1/2$, which is in agreement with the result from mean field theory.
And the increasing $z$ enhances the phase transition and increases the DC
resistivity which behaves as the colossal magnetic resistance effect in some

magnetic susceptibility satisfies the Cure-Weiss law with a general $z$. But
the increase of $z$ will result in shortening the period of the external

diagonal matrix with positive entries. The Cauchy interlace theorem states that
the eigenvalues of a real symmetric matrix interlace with those of any
principal submatrix (obtained by deleting a row-column pair of the original
matrix). In this paper we extend the Cauchy interlace theorem for symmetric
matrices to this large class, called symmetrizable matrices. This extension is
interesting by the fact that in the symmetric case, the Cauchy interlace
theorem together with the Courant-Fischer minimax theorem and Sylvester's law
of inertia, each one can be proven from the others and thus they are
essentially equivalent. The first two theorems have important applications in
the singular value and eigenvalue decompositions, the third is useful in the
development and analysis of algorithms for the symmetric eigenvalue problem.
Consequently various and several applications whom are contingent on the
symmetric condition may occur for this large class of not necessary symmetric
matrices and open the door for many applications in future studies. We note
that our techniques are based on the celebrated Dodgson's identity.

extending the result to a random comparison model where item pairs to compare

we demonstrate a spectral method alone to be sufficient to achieve the

purpose, in the three metrics proposed in arXiv:1510.08828, we try to perform
the dimensional reduction in which the anomaly cancellation method is feasible
at the near-horizon region in a general scalar field theory. As a result we can
demonstrate that the dimensional reduction is possible in two of those metrics.
Hence we perform the anomaly cancellation method and compute the Hawking fluxes
in those two metrics. Our Hawking fluxes involve the three effects: 1) the
quantum gravity effect regularizing the core of the black holes, 2) rotation of
the black hole, 3) the time-delay. Further in this paper toward the metric in
which the dimensional could not be performed, we argue that it would be some
problematic metric, and mention its cause. The Hawking fluxes we compute in
this study could be considered to correspond to more realistic Hawking fluxes.
Further what Hawking fluxes can be obtained from the anomaly cancellation

integrates numerical simulation models and observation data on the basis of
Bayesian statistics. Originally developed for meteorology, especially weather
forecasting, DA is now an accepted technique in various scientific fields. One
key issue that remains controversial is the implementation of DA in massive
simulation models under limited computation time and resources. In this paper,
we propose an adjoint-based DA method for massive autonomous models that
produces optimum estimates and their uncertainties within practical computation
time and resource constraints. The uncertainties are given as several diagonal
components of an inverse Hessian matrix, which is the covariance matrix of a
normal distribution that approximates the target posterior probability density
function in the neighborhood of the optimum. Conventional algorithms for
deriving the inverse Hessian matrix require $O(CN^2+N^3)$ computations and
$O(N^2)$ memory, where $N$ is the number of degrees of freedom of a given
autonomous system and $C$ is the number of computations needed to simulate time
series of suitable length. The proposed method using a second-order adjoint
method allows us to directly evaluate the diagonal components of the inverse
Hessian matrix without computing all of its components. This drastically
reduces the number of computations to $O(C)$ and the amount of memory to $O(N)$
for each diagonal component. The proposed method is validated through numerical
tests using a massive two-dimensional Kobayashi's phase-field model. We confirm
that the proposed method correctly reproduces the parameter and initial state
assumed in advance, and successfully evaluates the uncertainty of the
parameter. Such information regarding uncertainty is valuable, as it can be
used to optimize the design of experiments.

Bethe-Salpeter equation approach combined with the one-boson-exchange model.
With the help of the hidden-gauge Lagrangian, the exchanges of pseudoscalar
mesons ($\pi$ and $\eta$) and vector mesons ($\rho$, $\omega$ and $\phi$) are
considered to describe the $K\bar{K}^*$ interaction. Besides the direct
vector-meson exchange which can be related to the Weinberg-Tomozawa term,
pseudoscalar-meson exchanges also play important roles in the mechanism of the
$K\bar{K}^*$ interaction. The poles of scattering amplitude are searched to
find the molecular states produced from the $K\bar{K}^*$ interaction. In the
case of quantum number $I^G(J^{PC})=0^+(1^{++})$, a pole is found with a
reasonable cutoff, which can be related to the $f_1(1285)$ in experiment.
Another bound state with $0^-(1^{+-})$ is also produced from the $K\bar{K}^*$
interaction, which can be related to the $h_1(1380)$. In the isovector sector,
the interaction is much weaker and a bound state with $1^+(1^{+})$ relevant to
the $b_1(1235)$ is produced but at a larger cutoff. Our results suggest that in
the hadronic molecular state picture the $f_1(1285)$ and $b_1(1235)$ are the

whether the missingness mechanisms and covariate effects on outcome are the

give unbiased estimates of the intervention effect only if both intervention
groups have the same missingness mechanisms and the same covariate effects,
which is arguably unlikely to hold in practice. LMM and MI give unbiased

slightly overestimation of average standard error, which leads to a decrease in

widely used for computing the sensor responses, especially, in Frequency-Domain
Independent Component Analysis. One approach is the least-squares projection,
while the other one assumes a regular mixing matrix and computes its inverse.
Both estimators are invariant to the unknown scaling. Although frequently used,
their differences were not studied yet. A goal of this work is to fill this
gap. The estimators are compared through a theoretical study, perturbation
analysis and simulations. We point to the fact that the estimators are
equivalent when the separated signal subspaces are orthogonal, and vice versa.
Two applications are shown, one of which demonstrates a case where the

simulations. From the time evolution of a system, the growth rates of
individual bubbles are determined. At low temperatures, the system exhibits a
$t^{1/2}$ law and the growth rate is well described by classical
Lifshitz-Slyozov-Wagner (LSW) theory for the reaction-limited case. This is
direct evidence that the bubble coarsening at low temperatures is
reaction-limited. At high temperatures, although the system exhibits a
$t^{1/3}$ law, which suggests that it is diffusion-limited, the accuracy of the
growth rate is insufficient to determine whether the form is consistent with
the prediction of LSW theory for the diffusion-limited case. The gas volume
fraction dependence of the coarsening behavior is also studied. Although the
behavior of the system at low temperatures has little sensitivity to the gas
volume fraction up to 10%, that at high temperatures deviates from the
prediction of LSW theory for the diffusion-limited case as the gas volume
fraction increases. These results show that the mean-field-like treatment is
valid for a reaction-limited system even with a finite volume fraction, while
it becomes inappropriate for a diffusion-limited system since classical LSW
theory for the diffusion-limited case is valid at the dilute limit.

be significant. Analysis of ($\alpha$, $L_a$) distribution, where $L_a$ is the

found extending from uniform oxygen inclusion layers at the surface. These

layered superconductor $B_{c2}$ shows an anisotropy when the magnetic field is

The origin of blazar variability, seen from radio up to gamma rays,
is still a heavily debated matter and broadband flares offer a unique testbed
towards a better understanding of these extreme objects. Such an energetic
outburst was detected by Fermi/LAT in 2008 from the blazar PKS 1502+106. The
outburst was observed from gamma rays down to radio frequencies.
  Aims. Through the delay between flare maxima at different radio frequencies,
we study the frequency-dependent position of the unit-opacity surface and infer
its absolute position with respect to the jet base. This nuclear opacity
profile enables the magnetic field tomography of the jet. We also localize the
gamma-ray emission region and explore the mechanism producing the flare.
  Methods. The radio flare of PKS 1502+106 is studied through single-dish flux
density measurements at 12 frequencies in the range 2.64 to 226.5 GHz. To
quantify it, we employ both a Gaussian process regression and a discrete
cross-correlation function analysis.
  Results. We find that the light curve parameters (flare amplitude and
cross-band delays) show a power-law dependence on frequency. Delays decrease
with frequency, and the flare amplitudes increase up to about 43 GHz and then
decay. This behavior is consistent with a shock propagating downstream the jet.
The self-absorbed radio cores are located between about 10 and 4 pc from the
jet base and their magnetic field strengths range between 14 and 176 mG, at the
frequencies 2.64 to 86.24 GHz. Finally, the gamma-ray active region is located
at (1.9 +/- 1.1) pc away from the jet base.

observations provide an extremely detailed view of the nuclear regions in this

models describing the launching of relativistic jets. A pixel-based analysis of
the jet outflow, which still appears two-sided on the scales probed, was
performed. By fitting Gaussian functions to the transverse intensity profiles,
we could determine the jet width in the nuclear region. The base of the jets
appears wide. The minimum measured transverse width of ${\sim} (227\pm98)$
$R_{\bf S}$ is significantly larger than the radius of the Innermost Stable
Circular Orbit, suggesting that the outer accretion disk is contributing to the
jet launching. The existence of a faster and Doppler de-boosted inner section,
powered either from the rotation of the inner regions of the accretion disk or
by the spinning black hole, is suggested by the kinematic properties and by the
observed limb brightening of the flow.

(statistically) isotropic space-time and independent of cosmological parameters
or even the validity of the field equation of General Relativity. In
particular, this relation yields an equation between those distance ratios
which are the geometrical factors determining the strength of the gravitational
lensing effect of mass concentrations. Considering a combination of weak
lensing shear ratios, based on lenses at two different redshifts, and sources
at three different redshifts, we derive a relation between shear-ratio tests
which must be identically satisfied. A redshift-dependent multiplicative bias
in shear estimates will violate this relation, and thus can be probed by this
generalized shear-ratio test. Combining the lensing effect for lenses at three
different redshifts and three different source redshifts, a relation between
shear ratios is derived which must be valid independent of a multiplicative

extra gadgets to perform computation. Central to quantum algorithms are small
angle rotations, which can be fault-tolerantly implemented given a supply of an
unconventional species of magic state. We present a low-cost distillation
routine for preparing these small angle magic states. Our protocol builds on
the work of Duclos-Cianci and Poulin [Phys. Rev. A, 91, 042315 (2015)] by
compressing their circuit. Additionally, we present a method of diluting magic
states that reduces costs associated with very small angle rotations. We
quantify performance by the expected number of noisy magic states consumed per
rotation, and compare with other protocols. For modest size angles, our
protocols offer a factor 24 improvement over the best known gate synthesis
protocols and a factor 2 over the Duclos-Cianci and Poulin protocol. For very
small angle rotations, the dilution protocol dramatically reduces costs, giving
several orders magnitude improvement over competitors. There also exists an
intermediary regime of small, but not very small, angles where our approach
gives a marginal improvement over gate synthesis. We discuss how different
performance metrics may alter these conclusions.

agent has a battery -- a power source allowing it to move along network edges.
An agent uses its battery proportionally to the distance traveled. We consider
two tasks : convergecast, in which at the beginning, each agent has some
initial piece of information, and information of all agents has to be collected
by some agent; and broadcast in which information of one specified agent has to
be made available to all other agents. In both tasks, the agents exchange the
currently possessed information when they meet. The objective of this paper is
to investigate what is the minimal value of power, initially available to all
agents, so that convergecast or broadcast can be achieved. We study this
question in the centralized and the distributed settings. In the centralized
setting, there is a central monitor that schedules the moves of all agents. In
the distributed setting every agent has to perform an algorithm being unaware
of the network. In the centralized setting, we give a linear-time algorithm to
compute the optimal battery power and the strategy using it, both for
convergecast and for broadcast, when agents are on the line. We also show that
finding the optimal battery power for convergecast or for broadcast is NP-hard
for the class of trees. On the other hand, we give a polynomial algorithm that
finds a 2-approximation for convergecast and a 4-approximation for broadcast,
for arbitrary graphs. In the distributed setting, we give a 2-competitive
algorithm for convergecast in trees and a 4-competitive algorithm for broadcast
in trees. The competitive ratio of 2 is proved to be the best for the problem
of convergecast, even if we only consider line networks. Indeed, we show that
there is no (2 -- $\epsilon$)-competitive algorithm for convergecast or for
broadcast in the class of lines, for any $\epsilon$ \textgreater{} 0.

fingerprint. However, these edge states are found 0.25 eV below the Fermi level
which is an obstacle for transport experiments. Here, we address this obstacle
by comparing results of density functional slab calculations with scanning
tunneling spectroscopy and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy. We show
that the n-type doping of the intermetallic layer is intrinsically caused by
the polar surface and is well screened towards the bulk. In contrast, the
anionic ""spacer"" layer shows a gap at the Fermi level, both, on the surface and
in the bulk, i.e. it is not surface-doped due to iodine desorption. The well
screened surface dipole implies that a buried edge state, probably already
below a single spacer layer, is located at the Fermi level. Consequently, a
multilayer step covered by a spacer layer could provide access to the transport
properties of the topological edge states. In addition, we find a lateral
electronic modulation of the topologically non-trivial surface layer which is
traced back to the coupling with the underlying zigzag chain structure of the

product. This finding opened the question of whether the CH3O observed in the
dense core Barnard 1b could be formed by the gas-phase reaction of CH3OH and
OH. Several chemical models including this reaction and grain-surface processes
have been developed to explain the observed abundance of CH$_3$O with little
success. Here we report for the first time rate coefficients for the gas-phase
reaction of OH and CH3OH down to a temperature of 22 K, very close to those in
cold interstellar clouds. Two independent experimental set-ups based on the
supersonic gas expansion technique coupled to the pulsed laser photolysis-laser
induced fluorescence technique were used to determine rate coefficients in the
temperature range 22-64 K. The temperature dependence obtained in this work can
be expressed as k(22-64 K) = (3.6+/-0.1)e-12 (T/ 300)^(-1.0+/-0.2) cm3

optimal rates in many settings. While many generalizations and extensions of
Nesterov's original acceleration method have been proposed, it is not yet clear
what is the natural scope of the acceleration concept. In this paper, we study
accelerated methods from a continuous-time perspective. We show that there is a
Lagrangian functional that we call the \emph{Bregman Lagrangian} which
generates a large class of accelerated methods in continuous time, including
(but not limited to) accelerated gradient descent, its non-Euclidean extension,
and accelerated higher-order gradient methods. We show that the continuous-time
limit of all of these methods correspond to traveling the same curve in
spacetime at different speeds. From this perspective, Nesterov's technique and
many of its generalizations can be viewed as a systematic way to go from the
continuous-time curves generated by the Bregman Lagrangian to a family of
discrete-time accelerated algorithms.

quantum melting at zero temperature in two spatial dimensions. The theory
describes the liquid-crystalline phases with spatial symmetries in between a
quantum crystalline solid and an isotropic superfluid: quantum nematics and
smectics. It is based on an Abelian-Higgs-type duality mapping of phonons onto
gauge bosons (""stress photons""), which encode for the capacity of the crystal
to propagate stresses. Dislocations and disclinations, the topological defects
of the crystal, are sources for the gauge fields and the melting of the crystal
can be understood as the proliferation (condensation) of these defects, giving
rise to the Anderson-Higgs mechanism on the dual side. For the liquid crystal
phases, the shear sector of the gauge bosons becomes massive signaling that
shear rigidity is lost. Resting on symmetry principles, we derive the
phenomenological imaginary time actions of quantum nematics and smectics and
analyze the full spectrum of collective modes. The quantum nematic is a
superfluid having a true rotational Goldstone mode due to rotational symmetry
breaking, and the origin of this 'deconfined' mode is traced back to the
crystalline phase. The two-dimensional quantum smectic turns out to be a
dizzyingly anisotropic phase with the collective modes interpolating between
the solid and nematic in a non-trivial way. We also consider electrically
charged bosonic crystals and liquid crystals, and carefully analyze the
electromagnetic response of the quantum liquid crystal phases. In particular,
the quantum nematic is a real superconductor and shows the Meissner effect.
Their special properties inherited from spatial symmetry breaking show up
mostly at finite momentum, and should be accessible by momentum-sensitive
spectroscopy.

nanoflares, small-scale and possibly recurring heating events that release
magnetic energy. Aims. We investigate the effects of a periodic high-energy
electron beam on the synthetic spectra of coronal Fe ions. Methods. Initially,
the coronal plasma is assumed to be Maxwellian with a temperature of 1 MK. The
high-energy beam, described by a kappa-distribution, is then switched on every
period $P$ for the duration of P/2. The periods are on the order of several
tens of seconds, similar to exposure times or cadences of space-borne
spectrometers. Ionization, recombination, and excitation rates for the
respective distributions are used to calculate the resulting non-equilibrium
ionization state of Fe and the instantaneous and period-averaged synthetic
spectra. Results. Under the presence of the periodic electron beam, the plasma
is out of ionization equilibrium at all times. The resulting spectra averaged
over one period are almost always multithermal if interpreted in terms of
ionization equilibrium for either a Maxwellian or a kappa-distribution.
Exceptions occur, however; the EM-loci curves appear to have a nearly
isothermal crossing-point for some values of kappa_s. The instantaneous spectra
show fast changes in intensities of some lines, especially those formed outside
of the peak of the respective EM(T) distributions if the ionization equilibrium
is assumed.

recorded in dynamic scenes, since they are built under a strong assumption that
the captured scenes are static. Contrary to the existing methods, we propose a
video deblurring algorithm that can deal with general blurs inherent in dynamic
scenes. To handle general and locally varying blurs caused by various sources,
such as moving objects, camera shake, depth variation, and defocus, we estimate
pixel-wise non-uniform blur kernels. We infer bidirectional optical flows to
handle motion blurs, and also estimate Gaussian blur maps to remove optical
blur from defocus in our new blur model. Therefore, we propose a single energy
model that jointly estimates optical flows, defocus blur maps and latent
frames. We also provide a framework and efficient solvers to minimize the
proposed energy model. By optimizing the energy model, we achieve significant
improvements in removing general blurs, estimating optical flows, and extending
depth-of-field in blurry frames. Moreover, in this work, to evaluate the
performance of non-uniform deblurring methods objectively, we have constructed
a new realistic dataset with ground truths. In addition, extensive experimental
on publicly available challenging video data demonstrate that the proposed
method produces qualitatively superior performance than the state-of-the-art
methods which often fail in either deblurring or optical flow estimation.

telescoping problem in such rings, covering as special cases the summation
paradigms of telescoping and creative telescoping, one obtains a rather
flexible toolbox for symbolic summation. This article is the continuation of
this work. Inspired by Singer's Galois theory of difference equations we will
work out several alternative characterizations of $R\Pi\Sigma^*$-extensions:
adjoining naively sums and products leads to an $R\Pi\Sigma^*$-extension iff
the obtained difference ring is simple iff the ring can be embedded into the

$\Pi\Sigma^*$-extensions. From the viewpoint of applications this leads to a
fully automatic machinery to represent indefinite nested sums and products in

psychological diseases such as burnout, which lead developers to lose interest,
exhibit lower activity and/or feel powerless. Prevention is essential for such
diseases, which in turn requires early identification of symptoms. The
emotional dimensions of Valence, Arousal and Dominance (VAD) are able to derive
a person's interest (attraction), level of activation and perceived level of
control for a particular situation from textual communication, such as emails.
As an initial step towards identifying symptoms of productivity loss in
software engineering, this paper explores the VAD metrics and their properties
on 700,000 Jira issue reports containing over 2,000,000 comments, since issue
reports keep track of a developer's progress on addressing bugs or new
features. Using a general-purpose lexicon of 14,000 English words with known
VAD scores, our results show that issue reports of different type (e.g.,
Feature Request vs. Bug) have a fair variation of Valence, while increase in
issue priority (e.g., from Minor to Critical) typically increases Arousal.
Furthermore, we show that as an issue's resolution time increases, so does the
arousal of the individual the issue is assigned to. Finally, the resolution of
an issue increases valence, especially for the issue Reporter and for quickly
addressed issues. The existence of such relations between VAD and issue report
activities shows promise that text mining in the future could offer an
alternative way for work health assessment surveys.

both explicit and well-behaved. We give various corollaries of this, with a
particular focus on blocks of group rings of finite groups. In particular we
show that there are $\tau$-tilting finite wild blocks with more than one simple

which include all tame blocks of group rings. Note that since these algebras
are symmetric, this is the same as classifying all basic two-term tilting

two-term tilting complexes. We do this by using the aforementioned reduction
theorem, which reduces the problem to ten different algebras only depending on
the ground field $k$, all of which happen to be string algebras. To deal with
these ten algebras we give a combinatorial classification of all $\tau$-rigid

commenced in that arc. Halpha emission is present at the inner arc, but appears

information applications due to their bright single photon emission and
optically accessible spin states. Furthermore, SiV centers in low-strain
diamond are insensitive to pertubations of the dielectric environment, i.e.
they show very weak spectral diffusion. This property renders ensembles of SiV
centers interesting for sensing applications. We here report on
photoluminescence excitation (PLE) spectroscopy on an SiV ensemble in a low
strain, CVD-grown high quality diamond layer, where we measure the fine
structure with high resolution and obtain the linewidths and splittings of the
SiV centers. We investigate the temperature dependence of the width and
position of the fine structure peaks. Our measurements reveal linewidths of
about 10 GHz as compared to a lifetime limited width on the order of 0.1 GHz.
This difference arises from the inhomogeneous broadening of the transitions
caused by residual strain. To overcome inhomogeneous broadening we use spectral
hole burning spectroscopy which enables us to measure a nearly lifetime limited
homogeneous linewidth of 279 MHz. Furthermore, we demonstrate evidence of
coherent interaction in the system by driving a $\Lambda$-scheme. Additional
measurements on single emitters created by ion implantation confirm the
homogeneous linewidths seen in the spectral hole burning experiments and relate
the ground state splitting to the decoherence rate.

predict power-law distributions for the size of the events, and exponential
distributions for the waiting time. Despite a paucity of data, this prediction
is consistent with the size and waiting time distributions of most glitching

exhibit many large glitches, while a recent study of the Crab pulsar has
suggested a cut-off deviations from a power-law distribution for smaller

that the effect of vortex coupling to the neutron and proton fluids in the

the power consumption of the networking component in data center networks.
Still the question remains on which scheduling algorithms are most suited to
achieve this goal. We propose 4 different linear programming approaches that
schedule requested traffic flows on SDN switches according to different
objectives. Depending on pre-defined software quality requirements such as
delay and performance, a single variation or a combination of variations can be
selected to optimize the power saving and the performance metrics. Our
simulation results demonstrate that all our algorithm variations outperform the
shortest path scheduling algorithm, our baseline on power savings, less or more
strongly depending on the power model chosen. We show that in FatTree networks,
where switches can save up to 60% of power in sleeping mode, we can achieve 15%
minimum improvement assuming a one-to-one traffic scenario. Two of our
algorithm variations privilege performance over power saving and still provide
around 45% of the maximum achievable savings.

question of SC in Bi has remained unsolved both theoretically and
experimentally. Here, we report first ever observation of bulk SC in highly
pure Bi single crystals (99.9999\%) below 0.53~mK under ambient pressure with
an estimated critical magnetic field of 5.2~$\mu$T at 0~K. The conventional
Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS) theory cannot explain the observed SC in Bi,
since the adiabatic approximation of the BCS theory, $\omega_D/E_F<< 1$, does
not hold true for Bi. Bi has a multi-valley type electronic band structure and
SC in Bi could be brought about by the inter-valley electron-phonon coupling.
Such a scenario calls for new theoretical ideas to understand SC in such low
carrier systems with unusual band structure in the non-adiabatic limit,
$\omega_D/E_F \gtrsim 1$. The observation of SC in Bi makes it the lowest
carrier density superconductor surpassing the record held by doped SrTiO$_3$

outcomes that can be categorized into four regimes, dependent only on the
impact parameter; the two rings can either miss each other on the inside or
outside, or they can reconnect leading to final states consisting of either one
or two deformed rings. The fraction of of energy went into ring deformations
and the transverse component of velocity of the rings are analyzed for each
regime. We find that rings of very similar radius only reconnect for a very
narrow range of the impact parameter, much smaller than would be expected from
geometrical cross-section alone. In contrast, when the radii of the rings are
very different, the range of impact parameters producing a reconnection is
close to the geometrical value. A second type of interaction considered is the
collision of circular rings with a highly deformed ring. This type of
interaction appears to be a productive mechanism for creating small vortex
rings. The simulations are discussed in the context of experiments on colliding

are abundant in nature, in many practical scenarios the information of interest

generalization of the classical notion of stationarity to graph signals. The
contribution in this paper is twofold. Firstly, we propose a definition of weak
stationarity for random graph signals that takes into account the structure of
the graph where the random process takes place, while inheriting many of the
meaningful properties of the classical definition in the time domain. Our
definition requires that stationary graph processes can be modeled as the
output of a linear graph filter applied to a white input. We will show that
this is equivalent to requiring the correlation matrix to be diagonalized by
the graph Fourier transform. Secondly, we analyze the properties of the power
spectral density and propose a number of methods to estimate it. We start with
nonparametric approaches, including periodograms, window-based average
periodograms, and filter banks. We then shift the focus to parametric
approaches, discussing the estimation of moving-average (MA), autoregressive
(AR) and ARMA processes. Finally, we illustrate the power spectral density
estimation in synthetic and real-world graphs.

  These results are based on a compactness theorem for Ricci flows with bounded
scalar curvature, which states that any sequence of such Ricci flows converges,
after passing to a subsequence, to a metric space that is smooth away from a
set of codimension $\geq 4$. In the course of the proof, we will also establish
$L^{p < 2}$-curvature bounds on time-slices of such flows.

plasma frequencies. The concept of spoof plasmons extended the realms of
plasmonics to domains such as radio frequencies, magnetism, or even acoustic
waves. Here, we introduce the concept of localized surface platonic modes
(SPMs). We demonstrate that they can be generated on a two-dimensional clamped
(or stress-free) cylindrical surface, in a thin elastic plate, with
subwavelength corrugations under excitation by an incident flexural plane wave.
Our results show that the corrugated rigid surface is elastically equivalent to
a cylindrical scatterer with negatively uniform and dispersive flexural
rigidity. This, indeed, suggests that plasmonic-like platonic materials can be
engineered with potential applications in various areas including earthquake
sensing, or elastic imaging and cloaking.

analyse the dependence of the model dynamics on the truncation level of the

particular, we assess the robustness of the coupled low-frequency variability
when the number of modes is increased. An ""optimal"" configuration is proposed
for which the ocean resolution is sufficiently high, while the total number of

pointing out a curious aspect associated with the latter - physical dimensions
of $c^5/G$ as well as third time derivative of mass quadrupole moment are that
of luminosity. Formation of primordial black holes in the early universe and
progenitors of fast radio bursts could have generated GW luminosity comparable
to the Planck luminosity, $c^5/G$. I also address the issue of black hole

structured models whose parameters have a direct psychological interpretation
and highly complex, general-purpose models whose parameters and representations
are difficult to interpret. The former typically provide more insight into
cognition but the latter often perform better. This tension has recently
surfaced in the realm of educational data mining, where a deep learning
approach to predicting students' performance as they work through a series of
exercises---termed deep knowledge tracing or DKT---has demonstrated a stunning
performance advantage over the mainstay of the field, Bayesian knowledge
tracing or BKT. In this article, we attempt to understand the basis for DKT's
advantage by considering the sources of statistical regularity in the data that
DKT can leverage but which BKT cannot. We hypothesize four forms of regularity
that BKT fails to exploit: recency effects, the contextualized trial sequence,
inter-skill similarity, and individual variation in ability. We demonstrate
that when BKT is extended to allow it more flexibility in modeling statistical
regularities---using extensions previously proposed in the literature---BKT
achieves a level of performance indistinguishable from that of DKT. We argue
that while DKT is a powerful, useful, general-purpose framework for modeling
student learning, its gains do not come from the discovery of novel
representations---the fundamental advantage of deep learning. To answer the
question posed in our title, knowledge tracing may be a domain that does not
require `depth'; shallow models like BKT can perform just as well and offer us
greater interpretability and explanatory power.
