in the chiral SU(3) quark model which has successfully been employed to explain
the scattering and binding behaviors of baryonic systems. The mass and width
are explicitly calculated with two types of trial wave functions. The result
shows that the $(0s)^6 [6]_{orb}$ configuration is easy to convert to the
configuration with the same $[6]_{orb}$ symmetry but $2\hbar \omega$ excitation
back and forth, however, it is seldom to turn into a two-cluster configuration
with a (1s) relative motion in between. The resultant mass and width are about
$2394$MeV and $25$MeV, respectively, and the stable size is about $0.75fm$,
which are consistent with both the results in the two-cluster configuration
calculation and the data measured by the COSY collaboration. It seems that the
observed $d^*$ is a six-quark dominated exotic state with a spherical shape and
breath mode in the coordinate space. Moreover, if $d^*$ does have $2\hbar
\omega$ excitation, the $d^* \to np\pi\pi\pi$ decay mode might be a good place
to distinguish the real structure of the observed phenomenon by COSY. The
masses of various isospin-spin states of six-light-quark systems are also
computed. It is shown that by considering the coupling with the configurations
with $2\hbar \omega$ excitations, only the mirror state with $IS$=$30$ will be
lower down to the place where whose mass is slightly higher than the value of

on the effects of different triggering mechanisms and the differences between
thermal and kinetic feedback. Our main result is that pure thermal feedback
that is centrally injected behaves differently from feedback with even a small
kinetic component. Specifically, pure thermal feedback results in excessive
condensation and smothering of the AGN by cold gas because the feedback energy
does not propagate to large enough radii. We do not see large differences
between implementations of different triggering mechanisms, as long as the
spatial resolution is sufficiently high, probably because all of the
implementations tested here trigger strong AGN feedback under similar
conditions. In order to assess the role of resolution, we vary the size of the
""accretion zone"" in which properties are measured to determine the AGN
accretion rate and resulting feedback power. We find that a larger accretion
zone results in steadier jets but can also allow too much cold-gas condensation
in simulations with a Bondi-like triggering algorithm. We also vary the opening
angle of jet precession and find that a larger precession angle causes more of
the jet energy to thermalize closer to the AGN, thereby producing results
similar to pure thermal feedback. Our simulations confirm that AGN can regulate
the thermal state of cool-core galaxy clusters and maintain the core in a state
that is marginally susceptable to thermal instability and precipitation.

interference, this problem is formulated as a dynamic stochastic game (DSG)
between small cell base stations (SBSs). This game enables to capture the
dynamics of both the queues and channel states of the system. To solve this
game, assuming a large homogeneous UDN deployment, the problem is cast as a
mean-field game (MFG) in which the MFG equilibrium is analyzed with the aid of
low-complexity tractable partial differential equations. Exploiting the
stochastic nature of the problem, user scheduling is formulated as a stochastic
optimization problem and solved using the drift plus penalty (DPP) approach in
the framework of Lyapunov optimization. Remarkably, it is shown that by weaving
notions from Lyapunov optimization and mean-field theory, the proposed solution
yields an equilibrium control policy per SBS which maximizes the network
utility while ensuring users' quality-of-service. Simulation results show that
the proposed approach achieves up to 70.7% gains in EE and 99.5% reductions in

on improving EE while attempting to satisfy the users' instantaneous

neural networks is maximized on the so-called ""edge of criticality"". Once the
network operates in this configuration, it performs efficiently on a specific
application both in terms of (i) low prediction error and (ii) high short-term
memory capacity. Since the behavior of recurrent networks is strongly
influenced by the particular input signal driving the dynamics, a universal,
application-independent method for determining the edge of criticality is still
missing. In this paper, we aim at addressing this issue by proposing a
theoretically motivated, unsupervised method based on Fisher information for
determining the edge of criticality in recurrent neural networks. It is proven
that Fisher information is maximized for (finite-size) systems operating in
such critical regions. However, Fisher information is notoriously difficult to
compute and either requires the probability density function or the conditional
dependence of the system states with respect to the model parameters. The paper
takes advantage of a recently-developed non-parametric estimator of the Fisher
information matrix and provides a method to determine the critical region of
echo state networks, a particular class of recurrent networks. The considered
control parameters, which indirectly affect the echo state network performance,
are explored to identify those configurations lying on the edge of criticality
and, as such, maximizing Fisher information and computational performance.
Experimental results on benchmarks and real-world data demonstrate the
effectiveness of the proposed method.

explosion. Here we investigate how the morphology of the SNR Cassiopeia A (Cas
A) reflects the characteristics of the progenitor SN with the aim to derive the
energies and masses of the post-explosion anisotropies responsible for the
observed spatial distribution of Fe and Si/S. We model the evolution of Cas A
from the immediate aftermath of the progenitor SN to the three-dimensional
interaction of the remnant with the surrounding medium. The post-explosion
structure of the ejecta is described by small-scale clumping of material and
larger-scale anisotropies. The hydrodynamic multi-species simulations consider
an appropriate post-explosion isotopic composition of the ejecta. The observed
average expansion rate and shock velocities can be well reproduced by models
with ejecta mass $M_{\rm ej}\approx 4M_{\odot}$ and explosion energy $E_{\rm
SN}\approx 2.3\times 10^{51}$ erg. The post-explosion anisotropies (pistons)
reproduce the observed distributions of Fe and Si/S if they had a total mass of
$\approx 0.25\,M_{\odot}$ and a total kinetic energy of $\approx 1.5\times
10^{50}$ erg. The pistons produce a spatial inversion of ejecta layers at the
epoch of Cas A, leading to the Si/S-rich ejecta physically interior to the
Fe-rich ejecta. The pistons are also responsible for the development of bright
rings of Si/S-rich material which form at the intersection between the reverse
shock and the material accumulated around the pistons during their propagation.
Our result supports the idea that the bulk of asymmetries observed in Cas A are
intrinsic to the explosion.

superfluids. Rate-dependent hysteresis arises when a system is driven
periodically while relaxing towards equilibrium. A two-state paramagnet driven
by an oscillating magnetic field in the relaxation approximation clearly
demonstrates rate-dependent hysteresis. A noninteracting atomic Fermi gas in an
optical ring potential, when driven by a periodic artificial gauge field and
subjected to dissipation, is shown to exhibit hysteresis loops of atomic
current due to a competition of the driving time and the relaxation time. This
is in contrast to electronic systems exhibiting equilibrium persistent current
driven by magnetic flux due to rapid relaxation. Universal behavior of the
dissipated energy in one hysteresis loop is observed in both the magnetic and
atomic systems, showing linear and inverse-linear dependence on the relaxation
time in the strong and weak dissipation regimes. While interactions in general
invalidate the framework for rate-dependent hysteresis, an atomic Fermi gas
with artificial spin-orbit coupling exhibits hysteresis loops of atomic
currents. Cold-atoms in ring-shape potentials are thus promising in
demonstrating rate-dependent hysteresis and its associated phenomena.

show how they differ when applied to a moist atmosphere. Three factors, a
non-zero source/sink in the continuity equation, the difference between
velocities of gaseous air and condensate, and interaction between the gas and
condensate modifying the equations of motion, affect the formulation of $W$.
Starting from the thermodynamic definition of mechanical work, we derive an
expression for $W$ from an explicit consideration of the equations of motion
and continuity. Our analyses clarify how some past formulations are incomplete
or invalid. Three caveats are identified. First, $W$ critically depends on the
boundary condition for gaseous air velocity at the Earth's surface. Second,
confusion between gaseous air velocity and mean velocity of air and condensate
in the expression for $W$ results in gross errors despite the observed
magnitudes of these velocities are very close. Third, $W$ expressed in terms of
measurable atmospheric parameters, air pressure and velocity, is
scale-specific; this must be taken into account when adding contributions to
$W$ from different processes. We present a formulation of the atmospheric power
budget, which distinguishes three components of $W$: the kinetic power
associated with horizontal pressure gradients ($W_K$), the gravitational power
of precipitation ($W_P$) and the condensate loading ($W_c$). We use MERRA and
NCAR/NCEP re-analyses to evaluate the atmospheric power budget at different
scales: $W_K$ increases with temporal resolution approaching our theoretical
estimate for condensation-induced circulation when all convective motion is
resolved.

the SFR derived from our extinction-corrected measurements and that derived

luminosity. Our near-IR measurements are on average a factor 3 larger than
optical SFR, even when extinction corrections are applied. We found that LIRGs
have a median-observed star formation rate surface density of 1.72
Msun/yr/kpc^2 for the extinction-corrected distribution, whilst ULIRGs have
0.23 Msun/yr/kpc^2, respectively. These median values for ULIRGs increase up to
2.90 Msun/yr/kpc^2, when only their inner regions, covering the same size as
the average FoV of LIRGs, are considered. We identified a total of 95
individual SF clumps in our sample, with sizes within 60-1500pc, and
extinction-corrected Pa_alpha luminosities of 10^5-10^8 Lsun. Star-forming
clumps in LIRGs are about ten times larger and thousands of times more luminous
than typical clumps in spiral galaxies. Clumps in ULIRGs have sizes similar
(x0.5-1) to those of high-z clumps, having Pa_alpha luminosities similar to
some high-z clumps, and about 10 times less luminous than the most luminous
high-z clumps identified so far. We also observed a change in the slope of the

interacting and merging, and therefore their size represents a combination of
the distribution of the star-forming clumps within each galaxy in the system
plus the effect of the projected distance.

contribution to the sky brightness is non-negligible in the region near the
ecliptic plane, even in the far-infrared (far-IR) wavelength regime. We analyse
zodiacal emission observed by the AKARI far-IR all-sky survey, which covers 97%
of the entire sky at arcminute-scale resolution in four photometric bands, with
central wavelengths of 65, 90, 140, and 160 $\mu$m. AKARI detected small-scale
structures in the zodiacal dust cloud, including the asteroidal dust bands and
the circumsolar ring, at far-IR wavelengths. Although the smooth component of
the zodiacal emission structure in the far-IR sky can be reproduced well by
models based on existing far-IR observations, previous zodiacal emission models
have discrepancies in the small-scale structures compared with observations. We
investigate the geometry of the small-scale dust-band structures in the AKARI
far-IR all-sky maps and construct template maps of the asteroidal dust bands
and the circumsolar ring components based on the AKARI far-IR maps. In the
maps, $\pm 1.4\deg$, $\pm 2.1\deg$ and $\pm 10\deg$ asteroidal dust-band
structures are detected in the 65 $\mu$m and 90 $\mu$m bands. A possible $\pm
17\deg$ band may also have been detected. No evident dust-band structures are
identified in either the 140 $\mu$m or the 160 $\mu$m bands. By subtracting the
dust-band templates constructed in this paper, we can achieve a similar level
of flux calibration of the AKARI far-IR all-sky maps in the $|\beta| < 40\deg$
region to that in the region for $|\beta| > 40\deg$.

processes acting in the early solar nebula. Proposed chondrule formation models
are assessed based on their ability to match the meteoritic evidence,
especially experimental constraints on their thermal histories. The model most
consistent with chondrule thermal histories is passage through shock waves in
the solar nebula. Existing models of heating by shocks generally yield a good
first-order approximation to inferred chondrule cooling rates. However, they
predict prolonged heating in the pre-shock region, which would cause volatile
loss and isotopic fractionation, which are not observed. These models have
typically included particles of a single (large) size, i.e., chondrule
precursors, or at most, large particles accompanied by micron-sized grains. The
size distribution of solids present during chondrule formation controls the
opacity of the affected region, and significantly affects the thermal histories
of chondrules. Micron-sized grains evaporate too quickly to prevent excessive
heating of chondrule precursors. However, isolated grains in chondrule-forming
regions would rapidly coagulate into fractal aggregates. Pre-shock heating by
infrared radiation from the shock front would cause these aggregates to melt
and collapse into intermediate-sized (tens of microns) particles. We show that
inclusion of such particles yields chondrule cooling rates consistent with
petrologic and isotopic constraints.

stratum developing thereby stable self-organized and ordered thin structure. We
present a pioneering experimental investigation of structural and morphological
transformations in carbon tribolayers (CTL). By optical microscopy observation
it is found that CTL is a multilayer structure, the essential building block of
which is a transparent phase shaped as a lamina in-between the surface and
bottom disordered layers of CTL. The surface of the lamina exhibits non-linear
electrical conductivity near zero bias on I-V characteristics. The optical
properties of the whole CTL are mostly controlled by physical processes
occurring in the transparent lamina. The Raman spectrum of CTL contains narrow
bands at 1,589 cm-1 and 1,346 cm-1 corresponding to G and D bands of carbon
crystal lattice. The observed features are interpreted using the relationship
between the bond length and corresponding band frequency, r2{\omega}= const.
Optical absorption of CTL has a feature at 4.6 eV originating from strong
electron-hole interaction. From comparative analysis of experimental data,
structural-spectral correspondence is found. It is concluded that because of
phase transformation during rubbing, a carbon structure consisting of sp3

performance non-uniformity over different signal-to-noise-ratio regimes,

opportunities for more CPEs). Simulation results and comparisons unanimously
corroborate that MC-LDS outperforms IEEE 802.22 recommended algorithms, i.e.,

approximation by generalizing the inflationary attractor solution for
scalar-curvature theories. Our formulation gives rise to new generalized forms
for the potential slow-roll parameters, which enable us to examine the effect
of conformal transformations and inflaton reparameterizations in
scalar-curvature theories. We find that cosmological observables, such as the
power spectrum, the spectral indices and their runnings, can be expressed in a
concise manner in terms of the generalized potential slow-roll parameters which
depend on the scalar-curvature coupling function, the inflaton wavefunction,
and the inflaton potential. We show how the cosmological observables of
inflation are frame-invariant in this generalized potential slow-roll
formalism, as long as the end-of-inflation condition is appropriately extended
to become frame-invariant as well. We then apply our formalism to specific
scenarios, such as the induced gravity inflation, Higgs inflation and $F(R)$
models of inflation, and obtain more accurate results, without making
additional approximations to the potential. Our results are shown to be
consistent to lowest order with those presented in the literature. Finally, we
outline how our frame-covariant formalism can be naturally extended beyond the
tree-level approximation, within the framework of the Vilkovisky--DeWitt
effective action.

HL Tau into a number of axisymmetric bright and dark rings. Despite the very
young age of HL Tau these structures have been interpreted as signatures for
the presence of (proto)planets. The ALMA images triggered numerous theoretical
studies based on disk-planet interactions, magnetically driven disk structures,
and grain evolution. Of special interest are the inner parts of disks, where
terrestrial planets are expected to form. However, the emission from these
regions in HL Tau turned out to be optically thick at all ALMA wavelengths,
preventing the derivation of surface density profiles and grain size
distributions. Here, we present the most sensitive images of HL Tau obtained to
date with the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array at 7.0 mm wavelength with a
spatial resolution comparable to the ALMA images. At this long wavelength the
dust emission from HL Tau is optically thin, allowing a comprehensive study of
the inner disk. We obtain a total disk dust mass of 0.001 - 0.003 Msun,
depending on the assumed opacity and disk temperature. Our optically thin data
also indicate fast grain growth, fragmentation, and formation of dense clumps
in the inner densest parts of the disk. Our results suggest that the HL Tau
disk may be actually in a very early stage of planetary formation, with planets
not already formed in the gaps but in the process of future formation in the
bright rings.

obviates the need for these planar, thin-film technologies by enabling in-situ

Faraday cage around the sample during inductively-coupled plasma reactive ion

surface, directing ions normal to its face. In this Article, the effects

results from the electric current pumped by the dynamic magnetization

preferentially found around metal-rich stars and that their fraction increases
with the stellar mass. AIMS. During the past six years, we have conducted a
radial velocity follow-up program of 166 giant stars, to detect substellar
companions, and characterizing their orbital properties. Using this
information, we aim to study the role of the stellar evolution in the orbital
parameters of the companions, and to unveil possible correlations between the
stellar properties and the occurrence rate of giant planets. METHODS. Using
FEROS and CHIRON spectra, we have computed precision radial velocities and we
have derived atmospheric and physical parameters for all of our targets.
Additionally, velocities computed from UCLES spectra are presented here. By
studying the periodic radial velocity signals, we have detected the presence of
several substellar companions. RESULTS. We present four new planetary systems
around the giant stars HIP8541, HIP74890, HIP84056 and HIP95124. Additionally,
we find that giant planets are more frequent around metal-rich stars, reaching
a peak in the detection of $f$ = 16.7$^{+15.5}_{-5.9}$% around stars with
[Fe/H] $\sim$ 0.35 dex. Similarly, we observe a positive correlation of the
planet occurrence rate with the stellar mass, between M$_\star$ $\sim$ 1.0 -2.1
M$_\odot$, with a maximum of $f$ = 13.0$^{+10.1}_{-4.2}$%, at M$_\star$ = 2.1
M$_\odot$. CONCLUSIONS. We conclude that giant planets are preferentially
formed around metal-rich stars. Also, we conclude that they are more
efficiently formed around more massive stars, in the mass range of M$_\star$
$\sim$ 1.0 - 2.1 M$_\odot$. These observational results confirm previous
findings for solar-type and post-MS hosting stars, and provide further support
to the core-accretion formation model.

excitations of many-fermion systems. In its many applications, 3D
coordinate-space representation is used, and infinite-domain calculations are
limited to a finite volume represented by a box. For finite quantum systems
(atoms, molecules, nuclei), the commonly used periodic or reflecting boundary
conditions introduce spurious quantization of the continuum states and
artificial reflections from boundary; hence, an incorrect treatment of
evaporated particles. These artifacts can be practically cured by introducing
absorbing boundary conditions (ABC) through an absorbing potential in a certain
boundary region sufficiently far from the described system. But also the
calculations of infinite matter (crystal electrons, quantum fluids, neutron
star crust) suffer artifacts from a finite computational box. In this regime,
twist- averaged boundary conditions (TABC) have been used successfully to
diminish the finite-volume effects. In this work, we extend TABC to
time-dependent framework and apply it to resolve the box artifacts for finite
quantum systems using as test case small- and large-amplitude nuclear
vibrations. We demonstrate that by using such a method, one can reduce finite
volume effects drastically without adding any additional parameters. While they

remain semiconducting below and above $T_c$. As the in-plane lattice transforms
from a rectangle onto a square at $T_c$, the electronic, spin, optical, and

consistent with the background asymptote, $G_+$ and $G_-$ are bounded in the

linearized Kerr black hole around the Schwarzschild or Schwarschild de Sitter

is a choice of boundary conditions at the time-like boundary under which the
Schwarzschild anti de Sitter black hole is unstable. The root of
Chandrasekhar's duality relating odd and even modes is exhibited, and some

for the solution to optimization problems. Most problems exhibit complete
connectivity between the logical spin variables after they are mapped to the
Ising spin Hamiltonian of quantum annealing. To account for hardware
constraints of current and future physical quantum annealers, methods enabling
the embedding of fully connected graphs of logical spins into a constant-degree
graph of physical spins are therefore essential. Here, we compare the recently
proposed embedding scheme for quantum annealing with all-to-all connectivity
due to Lechner, Hauke and Zoller (LHZ) [Science Advances 1 (2015)] to the
commonly used minor embedding (ME) scheme. Using both simulated quantum
annealing and parallel tempering simulations, we find that for a set of
instances randomly chosen from a class of fully connected, random Ising
problems, the ME scheme outperforms the LHZ scheme when using identical
simulation parameters, despite the fault tolerance of the latter to weakly
correlated spin-flip noise. This result persists even after we introduce
several decoding strategies for the LHZ scheme, including a minimum-weight
decoding algorithm that results in substantially improved performance over the
original LHZ scheme. We explain the better performance of the ME scheme in
terms of more efficient spin updates, which allows it to better tolerate the
correlated spin-flip errors that arise in our model of quantum annealing. Our
results leave open the question of whether the performance of the two embedding
schemes can be improved using scheme-specific parameters and new error
correction approaches.

MH sensitivity still remains above 5$\sigma$ if the three new mixing angles
($\theta_{14}, \theta_{24}, \theta_{34}$) are all close to $\theta_{13}$. In
contrast, it can decrease to 4$\sigma$ if the least constrained mixing angle
$\theta_{34}$ is close to its upper limit $\sim 30^0$. We also assess the
sensitivity to the CPV induced both by the standard CP-phase $\delta_{13}
\equiv \delta$, and the new CP-phases $\delta_{14}$ and $\delta_{34}$. In the
3+1 scheme, the discovery potential of CPV induced by $\delta_{13}$ gets
deteriorated compared to the 3$\nu$ case. In particular, the maximal
sensitivity (reached around $\delta_{13}$ $\sim$ $\pm$ $90^0$) decreases from
$5\sigma$ to $4\sigma$ if all the three new mixing angles are close to
$\theta_{13}$. It can further diminish to almost $3\sigma$ if $\theta_{34}$ is
large ($\sim 30^0$). The sensitivity to the CPV due to $\delta_{14}$ can reach
3$\sigma$ for an appreciable fraction of its true values. Interestingly,
$\theta_{34}$ and its associated phase $\delta_{34}$ can influence both the
$\nu_e$ appearance and $\nu_\mu$ disappearance channels via matter effects,
which in DUNE are pronounced. Hence, DUNE can also probe CPV induced by
$\delta_{34}$ provided $\theta_{34}$ is large. We also reconstruct the two
phases $\delta_{13}$ and $\delta_{14}$. The typical 1$\sigma$ uncertainty on
$\delta_{13}$ ($\delta_{14}$) is $\sim20^0$ ($30^0$) if $\theta_{34} =0$. The
reconstruction of $\delta_{14}$ (but not that of $\delta_{13}$) degrades if

Abelian gauge field is considered. This theory corresponds to the bosonic
sector of a Kaluza-Klein dimensional reduction of eleven-dimensional
supergravity which induces a determined self-interacting potential for the
scalar field. We compute the conserved charges and carry out the thermodynamics
of an anti-de Sitter (AdS) dyonic black hole solution recently proposed. The
charges coming from symmetries of the action are computed by using the
Regge-Teitelboim Hamiltonian approach. These correspond to the mass, which
acquires contributions from the scalar field, and the electric charge.
Integrability conditions are introduced because the scalar field leads to
non-integrable terms in the variation of the mass. These conditions are
generically solved by introducing boundary conditions that arbitrarily relates
the leading and subleading terms of the scalar field fall-off. The Hamiltonian
Euclidean action, computed in the grand canonical ensemble, is obtained by
demanding the action to attain an extremum. Its value is given by a radial
boundary term plus an additional polar angle boundary term due to the presence
of a magnetic monopole. Remarkably, the magnetic charge can be identified from
the variation of the additional polar angle boundary term, confirming that the
first law of black hole thermodynamics is a consequence of having a
well-defined and finite Hamiltonian action principle, even if the charge does
not come from a symmetry of the action. The temperature and electrostatic
potential are determined demanding regularity on the black hole solution,
whereas the value of the magnetic potential is already identified in the
variation of the additional polar angle boundary term. Consequently, the first
law of black hole thermodynamics is identically satisfied by construction.

distinct gapped states in three dimensions is governed by a massless Dirac
fermion fixed point, irrespective of the underlying symmetry class, and this
constitutes a remarkably simple example of superuniversality. For a
sufficiently weak disorder strength, we show that the massless Dirac fixed
point is at the heart of the robustness of superuniversality. We establish this
by considering both perturbative and nonperturbative effects of disorder. The
superuniversality breaks down at a critical strength of disorder, beyond which
the topologically distinct localized phases become separated by a delocalized
diffusive phase. In the global phase diagram, the disorder controlled fixed
point where superuniversality is lost, serves as a multicritical point, where
the delocalized diffusive and two topologically distinct localized phases meet
and the nature of the localization-delocalization transition depends on the
underlying symmetry class. Based on these features we construct the global
phase diagrams of noninteracting, dirty topological systems in three
dimensions. We also establish a similar structure of the phase diagram and the
superuniversality for weak disorder in higher spatial dimensions. By noting
that $1/r^2$ power-law correlated disorder acts as a marginal perturbation for
massless Dirac fermion in any spatial dimension $d$, we have established a
general renormalization group framework for addressing disorder driven critical
phenomena for fixed spatial dimension $d > 2$.

which the Higgs is a pseudo-Nambu-Goldstone boson (pNGB). In pNGB Higgs models,
Higgs properties and precision electroweak measurements imply a hierarchy
between the EWSB and global symmetry-breaking scales, $v_H \ll f_H$. When the
pNGB potential is generated radiatively, this hierarchy requires fine-tuning to
a degree of at least $\sim v_H^2/f_H^2$. We show that if Higgs EWSB is induced
by a tadpole arising from an auxiliary sector at scale $f_\Sigma \ll v_H$, this
tuning is significantly ameliorated or can even be removed. We present explicit
examples both in Twin Higgs models and in Composite Higgs models based on
$SO(5)/SO(4)$. For the Twin case, the result is a fully natural model with $f_H
\sim 1$ TeV and the lightest colored top partners at 2 TeV. These models also
have an appealing mechanism to generate the scales of the auxiliary sector and
Higgs EWSB directly from the scale $f_H$, with a natural hierarchy $f_\Sigma

as well as new Higgs and vector states at LHC13.

flares and Coronal Mass Ejections (CMEs). Usually, solar active regions that
produce large flares will also produce a CME, but this is not always true
(Yashiro et al., 2005). Despite advances in numerical modeling, it is still
unclear which circumstances will produce a CME (Webb & Howard, 2012).
Therefore, it is worthwhile to empirically determine which features distinguish
flares associated with CMEs from flares that are not. At this time, no
extensive study has used physically meaningful features of active regions to
distinguish between these two populations. As such, we attempt to do so by
using features derived from [1] photospheric vector magnetic field data taken
by the Solar Dynamics Observatory's Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager instrument
and [2] X-ray flux data from the Geostationary Operational Environmental
Satellite's X-ray Flux instrument. We build a catalog of active regions that
either produced both a flare and a CME (the positive class) or simply a flare
(the negative class). We then use machine-learning algorithms to [1] determine
which features distinguish these two populations, and [2] forecast whether an
active region that produces an M- or X-class flare will also produce a CME. We
compute the True Skill Statistic, a forecast verification metric, and find that
it is a relatively high value of approximately 0.8 plus or minus 0.2. We
conclude that a combination of six parameters, which are all intensive in
nature, will capture most of the relevant information contained in the

Previous studies have proposed that giant clumps might have an important role
in the evolution of their host galaxy, particularly in building the central
bulge. However, this depends on whether clumps live long enough to migrate from
their original location in the disc or whether they get disrupted by their own
stellar feedback before reaching the centre of the galaxy. We use cosmological
hydrodynamical simulations from the FIRE (Feedback in Realistic Environments)
project that implement explicit treatments of stellar feedback and ISM physics
to study the properties of these clumps. We follow the evolution of giant
clumps in a massive (stellar mass ~10^10.8 Msun at z=1), discy, gas-rich galaxy
from redshift z>2 to z=1. Even though the clumpy phase of this galaxy lasts
over a gigayear, individual gas clumps are short-lived, with mean lifetime of
massive clumps of ~20 Myr. During that time, they turn between 0.1% and 20% of
their gas into stars before being disrupted, similar to local GMCs. Clumps with
M>10^7 Msun account for ~20% of the total star formation in the galaxy during
the clumpy phase, producing ~10^10 Msun of stars. We do not find evidence for
net inward migration of clumps within the galaxy. The number of giant clumps
and their mass decrease at lower redshifts, following the decrease in the
overall gas fraction and star-formation rate.

how this result breaks down with stronger proximity coupling by obtaining the

that the concentrated solid solution fcc alloys, including the so-called

centered cubic (fcc) alloy NiCoCrx with x near 1 is found to be close to the Cr

Near this composition these alloys exhibit a resistivity linear in temperature

temperature heat capacity and excess low temperature entropy. All of the low
temperature electrical, magnetic and thermodynamic properties of the alloys
with compositions near x near 1 are not typical of a Fermi liquid and suggest
strong magnetic fluctuations associated with a quantum critical region. The

a novel and unique platform to study quantum critical behavior in a highly

We have aimed for a minimalistic approach, assuming only familiarity with
classical real analysis and integration theory, and supplementing theory with
straightforward examples. We have chosen to focus in detail on the principle
properties of the signature which we believe are fundamental to understanding
its role in applications. We also present an informal discussion on some of its
deeper properties and briefly mention the role of the signature in rough paths
theory, which we hope could serve as a light introduction to rough paths for

signature to the area of machine learning. The signature approach represents a
non-parametric way for extraction of characteristic features from data. The
data are converted into a multi-dimensional path by means of various embedding
algorithms and then processed for computation of individual terms of the
signature which summarise certain information contained in the data. The
signature thus transforms raw data into a set of features which are used in
machine learning tasks. We will review current progress in applications of

repulsive-attractive nonlocal interaction models, where the repulsive effects
instead arise from an interaction kernel or the addition of diffusion. We
formulate our model as the Wasserstein gradient flow of an interaction energy,
with a penalization to enforce the constraint on the height of the density.
From this perspective, the problem can be seen as a singular limit of the
Keller-Segel equation with degenerate diffusion. Two key properties distinguish
our problem from previous work on height constrained equations: nonconvexity of
the interaction kernel (which places the model outside the scope of classical
gradient flow theory) and nonlocal dependence of the velocity field on the
density (which causes the problem to lack a comparison principle). To overcome
these obstacles, we combine recent results on gradient flows of nonconvex
energies with viscosity solution theory. We characterize the dynamics of patch
solutions in terms of a Hele-Shaw type free boundary problem and, using this
characterization, show that in two dimensions patch solutions converge to a
characteristic function of a disk in the long-time limit, with explicit rate of
convergence. We believe that a key contribution of the present work is our

  Waveguide Problems",,,,,"physics.comp-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We propose an efficient finite-element analysis of the vector wave equation
in a class of relatively general curved polygons. The proposed method is
suitable for an accurate and efficient calculation of the propagation constants
of waveguides filled with pieces of homogeneous materials. To apply the method,
we first decompose the 2-D problem domain into a set of curved polygons of a
specific characteristic. Then we divide every polygon into a set of triangular
elements with two straight edges. Finally, we introduce a set of hierarchical
mixed-order curl-conforming vector basis functions inside every triangular
element to discretize the vector wave equation. The advantages of the method
are as follows. The curved boundaries of the elements are modeled exactly and
hence there is no approximation in the geometrical modeling. 2-D integrals of
the matrix elements are reduced to 1-D integrals. Therefore, the matrix filling
can be performed very fast. Total number of elements due to the discretization
of a given domain is very small, and hence the discretization of the problem
domain takes up a very small percentage of the total computational time. We
validate the method by comparing the results with those of Ansoft HFSS
simulator and investigate the accuracy and efficiency of the method through
some numerical examples.

which designers adapt a game prototype so that the resulting gameplay is as
entertaining as possible. In industry, the evaluation of a game is often based
on costly playtests with human players. It suggests itself to automate this
process using surrogate models for the prediction of gameplay and outcome. In
this paper, the feasibility of automatic balancing using simulation- and
deck-based objectives is investigated for the card game top trumps.
Additionally, the necessity of a multi-objective approach is asserted by a
comparison with the only known (single-objective) method. We apply a
multi-objective evolutionary algorithm to obtain decks that optimise
objectives, e.g. win rate and average number of tricks, developed to express
the fairness and the excitement of a game of top trumps. The results are
compared with decks from published top trumps decks using simulation-based
objectives. The possibility to generate decks better or at least as good as
decks from published top trumps decks in terms of these objectives is
demonstrated. Our results indicate that automatic balancing with the presented
approach is feasible even for more complex games such as real-time strategy
games.

hyperelastic material with strongly nonlinear and anisotropic stress response.
Adapting the behavior of such a model to experimental or patient data gives
rise to a parameter estimation problem which involves a significant number of
parameters. Gradient-based optimization algorithms provide a way to solve such
nonlinear parameter estimation problems with relatively few iterations, but
require the gradient of the objective functional with respect to the model
parameters. This gradient has traditionally been obtained using finite
differences, the calculation of which scales linearly with the number of model
parameters, and introduces a differencing error. By using an automatically
derived adjoint equation, we are able to calculate this gradient more
efficiently, and with minimal implementation effort. We test this adjoint
framework on a least squares fitting problem involving data from simple shear
tests on cardiac tissue samples. A second challenge which arises in
gradient-based optimization is the dependency of the algorithm on a suitable
initial guess. We show how a multi-start procedure can alleviate this
dependency. Finally, we provide estimates for the material parameters of the
Holzapfel and Ogden strain energy law using finite element models together with
experimental shear data.

significantly lower, for a given $N$(H$_{\rm tot}$), in the LMC and

dust-to-gas ratios, and enhanced radiation fields -- where higher pressures are
required for stable cold, neutral clouds. The pressures may be further enhanced

$O(n^{-2})$. Our result generalizes a similar result of Peled, Sen and Zeitouni

  connectivity by a generalization of the correlation approach","24 pages, 11 figures",,,,"q-bio.QM","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Resting-state functional MRI (rs-fMRI) is widely used to noninvasively study
human brain networks. Network functional connectivity is often estimated by
calculating the timeseries correlation between blood-oxygen-level dependent
(BOLD) signal from different regions of interest. However, standard correlation
cannot characterize the direction of information flow between regions. In this
paper, we introduce and test a new concept, prediction correlation, to estimate
effective connectivity in functional brain networks from rs-fMRI. In this
approach, the correlation between two BOLD signals is replaced by a correlation
between one BOLD signal and a prediction of this signal via a causal system
driven by another BOLD signal. Three validations are described: (1) Prediction
correlation performed well on simulated data where the ground truth was known,
and outperformed four other methods. (2) On simulated data designed to display
the ""common driver"" problem, prediction correlation did not introduce false
connections between non-interacting driven ROIs. (3) On experimental data,
prediction correlation recovered the previously identified network organization
of human brain. Prediction correlation scales well to work with hundreds of
ROIs, enabling it to assess whole brain interregional connectivity at the
single subject level. These results provide an initial validation that
prediction correlation can capture the direction of information flow and
estimate the duration of extended temporal delays in information flow between
regions of interest based on BOLD signal. This approach not only maintains the
high sensitivity to network connectivity provided by the correlation analysis,
but also performs well in the estimation of causal information flow in the
brain.

we show how to construct in $O(n\lg{n})$ time a plane spanner of ${\cal C}$ of
maximum degree at most 4 and stretch factor at most 20. This improves a long
sequence of results on the construction of plane spanners of ${\cal C}$. Our
result matches the smallest known upper bound of 4 by Bonichon et al. on the
maximum degree of plane spanners of ${\cal C}$, while significantly improving
their stretch factor upper bound from 156.82 to 20. The construction of our
spanner is based on Delaunay triangulations defined with respect to the
equilateral-triangle distance, and uses a different approach than that used by
Bonichon et al. Our approach leads to a simple and intuitive construction of a
well-structured spanner, and reveals useful structural properties of the
Delaunay triangulations defined with respect to the equilateral-triangle

  The structure of the constructed spanner implies that when ${\cal P}$ is in
convex position, the maximum degree of this spanner is at most 3. Combining the
above degree upper bound with the fact that 3 is a lower bound on the maximum
degree of any plane spanner of ${\cal C}$ when the point-set ${\cal P}$ is in

biological systems involve interaction between populations, necessitating
models for two or more populations simultaneously. A lack of efficient methods
for evaluating finite-time transition probabilities of bivariate processes,
however, has restricted statistical inference in these models. Researchers rely
on computationally expensive methods such as matrix exponentiation or Monte
Carlo approximation, restricting likelihood-based inference to small systems,
or indirect methods such as approximate Bayesian computation. In this paper, we
introduce the birth(death)/birth-death process, a tractable bivariate extension
of the birth-death process. We develop an efficient and robust algorithm to
calculate the transition probabilities of birth(death)/birth-death processes
using a continued fraction representation of their Laplace transforms. Next, we
identify several exemplary models arising in molecular epidemiology,
macro-parasite evolution, and infectious disease modeling that fall within this
class, and demonstrate advantages of our proposed method over existing
approaches to inference in these models. Notably, the ubiquitous stochastic
susceptible-infectious-removed (SIR) model falls within this class, and we
emphasize that computable transition probabilities newly enable direct
inference of parameters in the SIR model. We also propose a very fast method
for approximating the transition probabilities under the SIR model via a novel
branching process simplification, and compare it to the continued fraction
representation method with application to the 17th century plague in Eyam.
Although the two methods produce similar maximum a posteriori estimates, the
branching process approximation fails to capture the correlation structure in

Employing the Montgomery technique, we succeed in resolving the anisotropy of

agreement with the expectations of band calculations. Application of uniaxial
strain amplifies the detectable anisotropy by disfavoring one of the three
possible tetragonal domains. In contrast with all other known anisotropic Fermi
liquids, the anisotropy has opposite signs for elastic and inelastic
scattering. Increasing the concentration of dopants leads to a drastic shift in
the temperature of the AFD transition either upward or downward. The latter
result puts strong constraints on any hypothetical role played by the AFD soft

tasks and must adapt to the home environment and preferences of their user.
Learning from demonstration is a promising choice, that would allow the
non-technical user to teach the robot different tasks. However, collecting
demonstrations in the home environment of a disabled user is time consuming,
disruptive to the comfort of the user, and presents safety challenges. It would
be desirable to perform the demonstrations in a virtual environment. In this
paper we describe a solution to the challenging problem of behavior transfer
from virtual demonstration to a physical robot. The virtual demonstrations are
used to train a deep neural network based controller, which is using a Long
Short Term Memory (LSTM) recurrent neural network to generate trajectories. The
training process uses a Mixture Density Network (MDN) to calculate an error
signal suitable for the multimodal nature of demonstrations. The controller
learned in the virtual environment is transferred to a physical robot (a
Rethink Robotics Baxter). An off-the-shelf vision component is used to
substitute for geometric knowledge available in the simulation and an inverse
kinematics module is used to allow the Baxter to enact the trajectory. Our
experimental studies validate the three contributions of the paper: (1) the
controller learned from virtual demonstrations can be used to successfully
perform the manipulation tasks on a physical robot, (2) the LSTM+MDN
architectural choice outperforms other choices, such as the use of feedforward
networks and mean-squared error based training signals and (3) allowing
imperfect demonstrations in the training set also allows the controller to
learn how to correct its manipulation mistakes.

Virtualization (NFV) paradigm, they need to transition their network function
capacity to a virtualized infrastructure with different Network Functions

technique for allocating server resources (compute, storage and network) for a
given set of Virtual Network Function (VNF) requirements. Our approach helps
the telco providers decide the most effective way to run several VNFs on
servers with different performance characteristics. Our analysis of prior VNF
performance characterization on heterogeneous/different server resource
allocations shows that the ability to arbitrarily create many VNFs among
different servers' resource allocations leads to a comparative advantage among
servers. We propose a VNF resource allocation method called COMPARE that
maximizes the total throughput of the system by formulating this resource
allocation problem as a comparative advantage problem among heterogeneous
servers. There several applications for using the VNF resource allocation from
COMPARE including transitioning current Telco deployments to NFV based
solutions and providing initial VNF placement for Service Function Chain (SFC)

arbitrary number, $n$, of compact extra dimensions. After fixing the gauge with
respect to the Kaluza-Klein heavy gauge modes in a covariant manner, we
calculate a gauge independent effective Lagrangian expansion containing
multiple Kaluza-Klein sums that entail a bad divergent behavior. We use the
Epstein-zeta function to regularize and characterize discrete divergences
within such multiple sums, and then we discuss the interplay between the number
of extra dimensions and the degree of accuracy of effective Lagrangians to
generate or not divergent terms of discrete origin. We find that
nonrenormalizable terms with mass dimension $k$ are finite as long as $k>4+n$.
Multiple Kaluza-Klein sums of nondecoupling logarithmic terms, not treatable by
Epstein-zeta regularization, are produced by four-dimensional momentum
integration. On the grounds of standard renormalization, we argue that such

the observed gaps in protoplanetary disks. The width and depth of the gaps
depend on the planet mass and disk properties. We have performed
two--dimensional hydrodynamic simulations for various planet masses, disk
aspect ratios and viscosities, to obtain an empirical formula for the gap
width. The gap width is proportional to the square root of the planet mass,
-3/4 power of the disk aspect ratio and -1/4 power of the viscosity. This
empirical formula enables us to estimate the mass of a planet embedded in the
disk from the width of an observed gap. We have applied the empirical formula
for the gap width to the disk around HL~Tau, assuming that each gap observed by
ALMA observations is produced by planets, and discussed the planet masses
within the gaps. The estimate of planet masses from the gap widths is less
affected by the observational resolution and dust filtration than that from the
gap depth.

ellipses as input by examining their neighborhood structure to form sets of

fitted to the geometric primitives. The complexity for point processing is
O(n); additional time of lower order is needed for working on significantly
smaller amount of mid-level objects. This allows the approach to process 30

of the K2 mission. In this paper, the eight CVs showing distinct features are
analyzed in detail. Among these eight, modulations during quiescence are
evident at the known orbital periods in the SU UMa stars QZ Vir and RZ Leo, and
at our newly determined orbital periods of 1RXS J0632+2536 and WD 1144+011. The
periodogram analysis for the quiescent light curve of QZ Vir reveals
multi-period modulations and the coexistence of orbital and superhump periods.
The phased orbital light curves for the other 3 CVs in quiescence display wide
(about half cycle) and shallow (< 0.5 mag) eclipse features. Besides these
modulations, their quiescent light curves reveal several transient events: a
sudden decrease of system light in 1RXS J0632+2536, a low level flare-like
event in QZ Vir, a short brightening event in RZ Leo and a temporary
disappearance of the orbital modulation in WD 1144+011. The two known dwarf
novae UV Gem and TW Vir and the CVs USNO-B1.01144-00115322 and
CSS130516:111236.7+002807 show outbursts, including 1 complete and 3 incomplete
normal outbursts and 2 complete superoutbursts. An incomplete but typical
normal outburst confirms the dwarf nova identification of the
USNO-B1.01144-00115322. The one complete normal outburst in UV Gem possibly
provides the orbital period, since its modulations are shorter than the
previously observed superhump period. The superoutbursts of TW Vir and
CSS130516:111236.7+002807, along with their corresponding superhump periods,
indicate that both objects are SU UMa stars. The derived superhump period of
CSS130516:111236.7+002807 is 1.44 hr, implying that this new SU UMa star is
close to the period minimum.

emission. The direct detection of 1.4 GHz radio continuum emission is made in 8
WEL galaxies and a median stacking is performed on 57 WEL galaxies using VLA
FIRST images. The median stacked 1.4 GHz flux density and luminosity are
estimated as 79 $\pm$ 19 $\mu$Jy and 0.20 $\pm$ 0.05 $\times$ 10$^{21}$ W
Hz$^{-1}$ respectively. The radio far-infrared correlation in 4 WEL galaxies
suggests that the radio continuum emission from WEL galaxies is most likely due
to star formation activities. The median SFR for WEL galaxies is estimated as
0.23 $\pm$ 0.06 M$_{\odot}$yr$^{-1}$, which is much less compared to SFRs ($0.5
- 50$ M$_{\odot}$yr$^{-1}$) in purely star forming blue ETGs. The SFRs in blue
ETGs are found to be correlated with their stellar velocity dispersions
($\sigma$) and decreasing gradually beyond $\sigma$ of $\sim 100$ km s$^{-1}$.
This effect is most likely linked with the growth of black hole and suppression
of star formation via AGN feedback. The color differences between SF and WEL
sub-types of blue ETGs appear to be driven to large extent by the level of
current star formation activities. In a likely scenario of an evolutionary
sequence between sub-types, the observed color distribution in blue ETGs can be
explained best in terms of fast evolution through AGN feedback.

a distributed fashion. We refer to this recognizer as SeMDER. Starting from
word embeddings of discourse arguments, SeMDER employs a shallow encoder to
generate a distributed surface representation for a discourse. A semantic
encoder with attention to the semantic memory matrix is further established
over surface representations. It is able to retrieve a deep semantic meaning
representation for the discourse from the memory. Using the surface and
semantic representations as input, SeMDER finally predicts implicit discourse
relations via a neural recognizer. Experiments on the benchmark data set show
that SeMDER benefits from the semantic memory and achieves substantial
improvements of 2.56\% on average over current state-of-the-art baselines in
terms of F1-score.

the plane-of-the-sky magnetic field geometry. The main aim of the study is to
understand the most plausible mechanism responsible for the unusual cometary
shape of the cloud in the context of its magnetic field geometry. When
unpolarized starlight passes through the intervening interstellar dust grains
that are aligned with their short axes parallel to the local magnetic field, it
gets linearly polarized. The plane-of-the-sky magnetic field component can
therefore be traced by doing polarization measurements of background stars
projected on clouds. Because the light in the optical wavelength range is most
efficiently polarized by the dust grains typically found in the outer layers of
the molecular clouds, optical polarimetry enables us to trace the magnetic
field geometry of the outer layers of the clouds. We made R-band polarization
measurements of 207 stars in the direction of Gal 110-13. The distance of Gal
110-13 was determined as $\sim450\pm80$ pc using our polarization and 2MASS
near-infrared data. The foreground interstellar contribution was removed from
the observed polarization values by observing a number of stars located in the
vicinity of Gal 110-13 which has Hipparcos parallax measurements. The
plane-of-the-sky magnetic field lines are found to be well ordered and aligned
with the elongated structure of Gal 110-13. Using structure function analysis,
we estimated the strength of the plane-of-the-sky component of the magnetic
field as $\sim25\mu$G. Based on our results and comparing them with those from

distinguished among others for its simplicity and its physical relevance. By
compromising General Relativity (GR) and Thermodynamics at cosmological scale,
we end up with a model without DE. Instead, the Universe we are proposing is
filled with a perfect fluid of self-interacting dark matter (DM), the volume
elements of which perform hydrodynamic flows. To the best of our knowledge, it
is the first time in a cosmological framework that the energy of the cosmic
fluid internal motions is also taken into account as a source of the universal
gravitational field. As we demonstrate, this form of energy may compensate for
the DE needed to compromise spatial flatness, while, depending on the
particular type of thermodynamic processes occurring in the interior of the DM
fluid (isothermal or polytropic), the Universe depicts itself as either
decelerating or accelerating (respectively). In both cases, there is no
disagreement between observations and the theoretical prediction of the distant
supernovae (SNe) Type Ia distribution. In fact, the cosmological model with
matter content in the form of a thermodynamically-involved DM fluid not only
interprets the observational data associated with the recent history of
Universe expansion, but also confronts successfully with every major
cosmological issue (such as the age and the coincidence problems). In this way,
depending on the type of thermodynamic processes in it, such a model may serve
either for a conventional DE cosmology or for a viable alternative one.

First, it forgets the natural link between the homological properties of
filtrations associated with lines that are close to each other. As a
consequence, part of the interesting homological information is lost. Second,
its intrinsically discontinuous definition makes it difficult to study its
properties. In this paper we introduce a new matching distance for 2D
persistent Betti numbers, called coherent matching distance and based on
matchings that change coherently with the filtrations we take into account. Its
definition is not trivial, as it must face the presence of monodromy in
multidimensional persistence, i.e. the fact that different paths in the space
parameterizing the above filtrations can induce different matchings between the
associated persistent diagrams. In our paper we prove that the coherent 2D

amount of charge $Q = me$ transmitted during the time $t$. Although numerous
systems have been theoretically characterized by their FCS, the experimental
measurement of the distribution function $P_t(m)$ or its moments $\langle Q^n
\rangle$ are rare and often plagued by strong back-action. Here, we present a
strategy for the measurement of the FCS, more specifically its characteristic
function $\chi(\lambda)$ and moments $\langle Q^n \rangle$, by a qubit with a
set of different couplings $\lambda_j$, $j = 1,\dots,k,\dots k+p$, $k = \lceil
n/2 \rceil$, $p \geq 0$, to the mesoscopic conductor. The scheme involves
multiple readings of Ramsey sequences at the different coupling strengths
$\lambda_j$ and we find the optimal distribution for these couplings
$\lambda_j$ as well as the optimal distribution $N_j$ of $N = \sum N_j$
measurements among the different couplings $\lambda_j$. We determine the
precision scaling for the moments $\langle Q^n \rangle$ with the number $N$ of
invested resources and show that the standard quantum limit can be approached
when many additional couplings $p\gg 1$ are included in the measurement scheme.

controlled vehicles avoid collisions at all future times. The supervisor is

crystalline-electric-field (CEF) doublet ground state is realized in Pr$^{3+}$

effect can be described by the two-channel Kondo model, which leads to the
local non-Fermi-liquid (NFL) ground state, while the magnetic Kondo effect
favors the ordinary local Fermi-liquid (FL) ground state. Based on the minimal
extended two-channel Kondo model including the magnetic Kondo coupling as well,
we investigate the competition and resulting thermodynamics, and
orbital/magnetic, and single-particle excitation spectra by the Wilson's
numerical renormalization-group (NRG) method. There exists the first-order
transition between the NFL and FL ground states. In addition to these two
states, the alternative FL state accompanied by a free magnetic spin appears in
intermediate temperature range, which eventually reaches the true NFL ground
state, as a consequence of stronger competition between the magnetic and
quadrupolar Kondo effects. In this peculiar state, the magnetic susceptibility
shows a Curie-like behavior, while the orbital fluctuation exhibits the FL
behavior. Moreover, the single-particle spectra yield a more singular behavior.
Implications to the Pr 1-2-20 systems are briefly discussed.

soft-tissue contrast at lower x-ray dose. The dose strongly depends on both the
angular sensitivity and on the visibility of a grating-based Talbot-Lau
interferometer. Using a conventional x-ray tube, a high sensitivity and a high
visibility are somewhat contradicting goals: To increase sensitivity, the
grating period has to be reduced and/or the grating distance increased.
Technically, this means using a higher Talbot order (3rd or 5th one instead of
first one). This however reduces the visibility somewhat, because only a
smaller part of the tube spectrum will get used. This work proposes to relax
this problem by changing the phase grating geometry. This allows to double
sensitivity (i.e., double the Talbot order) without reducing the visibility.
One proposed grating geometry is an older binary one (75% of a period
$\pi$-shifting), but applied in a novel way. The second proposed geometry is a
novel one, requiring three height levels for polychromatic correction. The
advantage is quantified by a simulation of the resulting interference patterns.
Visibilities for the common $\pi$-shifting gratings are compared with the
proposed alternative geometries. This is done depending on photon energy and
opening ratio of the coherence grating G0. It shows that despite of doubled
sensitivity of the proposed gratings, the overall visibility might even improve
a little.

of neutron star progenitors to black holes. It has been proposed that the
shedding of the strong neutron star magnetic field ($B$) during the collapse is
the power source for the radio emission. Previously, these models have utilized
the simplicity of the Schwarzschild metric which has the restriction that the
magnetic flux is magnetic ""hair"" that must be shed before final collapse. But,
neutron stars have angular momentum and charge and a fully relativistic Kerr
Newman solution exists in which $B$ has its source inside of the event horizon.
In this letter, we consider the magnetic flux to be shed as a consequence of
the electric discharge of a metastable collapsed state of a Kerr Newman black
hole. It has also been argued that the shedding model will not operate due to
pair creation. By considering the pulsar death line, we find that for a neutron
star with $B = 10^{11} - 10^{13}$ G and a long rotation period, $>1$ s this is
not a concern. We also discuss the observational evidence supporting the

and its effect on the reaction rates. Diffusion in biological systems is often
modeled by a discrete space jump process in order to capture the inherent noise
of biological systems, which becomes important in the low copy number regime.
To model diffusion in the crowded cell environment efficiently, we compute the
jump rates in this mesoscopic model from local first exit times, which account
for the microscopic positions of the crowding molecules, while the diffusing
molecules jump on a coarser Cartesian grid. We then extract a macroscopic
description from the resulting jump rates, where the excluded volume effect is
modeled by a diffusion equation with space dependent diffusion coefficient. The
crowding molecules can be of arbitrary shape and size and numerical experiments
demonstrate that those factors together with the size of the diffusing molecule
play a crucial role on the magnitude of the decrease in diffusive motion. When
correcting the reaction rates for the altered diffusion we can show that
molecular crowding either enhances or inhibits chemical reactions depending on
local fluctuations of the obstacle density.

  local search algorithm","13 pages",,,,"cs.AI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We consider a multi-neighborhood local search algorithm with a large number
of possible neighborhoods. Each neighborhood is accompanied by a weight value
which represents the probability of being chosen at each iteration. These
weights are fixed before the algorithm runs, and are considered as parameters
of the algorithm. Given a set of instances, off-line tuning of the algorithm's
parameters can be done by automated algorithm configuration tools (e.g., SMAC).
However, the large number of neighborhoods can make the tuning expensive and
difficult even when the number of parameters has been reduced by some
intuition. In this work, we propose a systematic method to characterize each
neighborhood's behaviours, representing them as a feature vector, and using
cluster analysis to form similar groups of neighborhoods. The novelty of our
characterization method is the ability of reflecting changes of behaviours
according to hardness of different solution quality regions. We show that using
neighborhood clusters instead of individual neighborhoods helps to reduce the
parameter configuration space without misleading the search of the tuning
procedure. Moreover, this method is problem-independent and potentially can be
applied in similar contexts.

  arXiv:1208.4334",,,,"math.NT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  This is the second paper in a series of two in which a global algebraic
number theory of the reals is formulated with the purpose of providing a
unified setting for algebraic and transcendental number theory. In this paper,
to any real number $\theta$ we associate its polynomial diophantine
approximation ring: a tri-filtered subring of a nonstandard model of the ring
$\mathbb{Z}[X]$. We characterize the filtration structure of the polynomial
diophantine approximation ring according to the Mahler class and the Mahler
type of $\theta$. The arithmetic of polynomial diophantine approximation groups
is introduced in terms of the tensor product of polynomials. In particular, it
is shown that polynomial diophantine approximation groups have the structure of
approximate ideals: wherein a partial tensor product of two polynomial
diophantine approximation groups may be performed by restriction to
substructures of the tri-filtration. The explicit characterization of this
partial product law is the main theorem of this paper.

electrons in the energy range 9-10000 eV in xenon gas. Analytically fitted form
of electron impact cross sections for elastic and various inelastic processes
are fed as input data to the model. Two dimensional numerical yield spectrum,
which gives information on the number of energy loss events occurring in a
particular energy interval, is obtained as output of the model. Numerical yield
spectrum is fitted analytically, thus obtaining analytical yield spectrum. The
analytical yield spectrum can be used to calculate electron fluxes, which can
be further employed for the calculation of volume production rates. Using yield
spectrum, mean energy per ion pair and efficiencies of inelastic processes are
calculated. The value for mean energy per ion pair for Xe is 22 eV at 10 keV.
Ionization dominates for incident energies greater than 50 eV and is found to
have an efficiency of 65% at 10 keV. The efficiency for the excitation process
is 30% at 10 keV.

convergence problem of existing gradient descent based algorithms and applies
to several well-known cost functions for effective blind signal recovery
including blind equalization and blind source separation in both
single-input-single-output (SISO) and multi-input-multi-output (MIMO) systems.

this approach. The simulation results demonstrate that our approach is suitable
