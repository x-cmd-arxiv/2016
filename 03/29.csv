likelihood when a galaxy model is specified, without the need for external
calibration. We test these bias-corrected estimators on simulated galaxy images
similar to those expected from planned space-based weak lensing surveys, with
promising results. We find that the introduction of an intrinsic shape prior
can help with mitigation of noise bias, such that the maximum a posteriori
estimate can be made less biased than the maximum likelihood estimate.
Second-order terms offer a check on the convergence of the estimators, but are
largely sub-dominant. We show how biases propagate to shear estimates,
demonstrating in our simple setup that shear biases can be reduced by orders of
magnitude and potentially to within the requirements of planned space-based
surveys at mild signal-to-noise. We find that second-order terms can exhibit
significant cancellations at low signal-to-noise when Gaussian noise is
assumed, which has implications for inferring the performance of
shear-measurement algorithms from simplified simulations. We discuss the
viability of our point estimators as tools for lensing inference, arguing that

cannot be perfectly distinguished by local operations and classical
communication (LOCC). Such sets are nonlocal sets which exhibit nonlocality
without entanglement. These nonlocal sets can be completable or uncompletable.
In this work both completable and uncompletable small nonlocal sets of
multipartite orthogonal product states are constructed. Apart from nonlocality,
these sets have other interesting properties. In particular, the completable
sets lead to the construction of a class of complete orthogonal product bases
with the property that if such a basis is given then no state can be eliminated
from that basis by performing orthogonality-preserving measurements. On the
other hand, an uncompletable set of the present kind contains several Shifts
unextendible product bases (UPBs) that belong to qubit subspaces. Identifying
these subspace UPBs, it is possible to obtain a class of high-dimensional
multipartite bound entangled states. Finally, it is shown that a two-qubit
maximally entangled Bell state shared between any two parties is sufficient as
a resource to distinguish the states of any completable set (of the above kind)
perfectly by LOCC. This constitutes an example where the amount of
entanglement, sufficient to accomplish the aforesaid task, depends neither on
the dimension of the individual subsystems nor on the number of parties.

dispersion and density and assuming a lognormal density distribution at each

can only be inferred from experimental measurements. In neuroscience,
non-invasive imaging tools are extensively used to derive either structural or
functional brain networks in-vivo. As a result of the inference process, we
obtain a matrix of values corresponding to an unrealistic fully connected and
weighted network. To turn this into a useful sparse network, thresholding is
typically adopted to cancel a percentage of the weakest connections. The
structural properties of the resulting network depend on how much of the
inferred connectivity is eventually retained. However, how to fix this
threshold is still an open issue. We introduce a criterion, the efficiency cost
optimization (ECO), to select a threshold based on the optimization of the
trade-off between the efficiency of a network and its wiring cost. We prove
analytically and we confirm through numerical simulations that the connection
density maximizing this trade-off emphasizes the intrinsic properties of a
given network, while preserving its sparsity. Moreover, this density threshold
can be determined a-priori, since the number of connections to filter only
depends on the network size according to a power-law. We validate this result
on several brain networks, from micro- to macro-scales, obtained with different
imaging modalities. Finally, we test the potential of ECO in discriminating
brain states with respect to alternative filtering methods. ECO advances our
ability to analyze and compare biological networks, inferred from experimental

origin of these modifications are corrections to the Mukhanov-Sasaki equations

specific form of these corrections depends on a series of details of the
quantization approach and of the prescription followed to implement it.
Generally, nonetheless, the complexity of the theoretical quantum formulation
is simplified in practice appealing to a semiclassical or effective
approximation, in order to perform concrete numerical computations. In this
work, we introduce technical tools and design a procedure to deal with these
quantum corrections beyond the most direct approximations employed so far in

extract the quantum dynamics of the homogeneous geometry in absence of scalar
field potential and inhomogeneities, dynamics that has been intensively studied

are linear in the forces through a $\tau$-dependent Onsager matrix whose
off-diagonal elements satisfy a reciprocal relation. The dynamics of the piston
can be approximated, through a coarse-graining procedure, by a Klein-Kramers
equation which - in the linear regime - yields analytic expressions for the
Onsager coefficients and the entropy production. A study of the efficiency at
maximum power shows that the Curzon-Ahlborn formula is always an upper limit
which is approached at increasing values of the thermodynamic forces, i.e.
outside of the linear regime. In all our analysis the adiabatic limit $\tau \to
\infty$ and the the small force limit $\delta,\epsilon \to 0$ are not directly
related.

state, using highly nondegenerate spontaneous parametric downconversion (SPDC).
Spectrally factorable photon pairs can be generated by incorporating a
broadband pump pulse and a group-velocity matching (GVM) condition in a
periodically-poled potassium titanyl phosphate (PPKTP) crystal. The heralding
photon is in the near IR, close to the peak detection efficiency of
off-the-shelf Si single-photon detectors; meanwhile, the heralded photon is in
the telecom L-band where fiber losses are at a minimum. We observe spectral
factorability of the SPDC source and consequently high purity (90%) of the
produced heralded single photons by several different techniques. Because this
source can also realize a high heralding efficiency (> 90%), it would be
suitable for time-multiplexing techniques, enabling a pseudo-deterministic
single-photon source, a critical resource for optical quantum information and
communication technology.

Knowledge claims at the research front are more likely to be transitory and are
therefore problematic as indicators of quality. Citation impact studies focus
on short-term citation, and therefore tend to measure not epistemic quality,
but involvement in current discourses in which contributions are positioned by
referencing. We explore this argument using three case studies: (1) citations
of the journal Soziale Welt as an example of a venue that tends not to publish
papers at a research front, unlike, for example, JACS; (2) Robert Merton as a
concept symbol across theories of citation; and (3) the Multi-RPYS

Scientometrics, Gene, and Soziale Welt. We show empirically that the
measurement of ""quality"" in terms of citations can further be qualified:
short-term citation currency at the research front can be distinguished from
longer-term processes of incorporation and codification of knowledge claims
into bodies of knowledge. The recently introduced Multi-RPYS can be used to
distinguish between short-term and long-term impacts.

published in HPCA 2015. The key goal of AL-DRAM is to exploit the extra margin
that is built into the DRAM timing parameters to reduce DRAM latency. The key
observation is that the timing parameters are dictated by the worst-case
temperatures and worst-case DRAM cells, both of which lead to small amount of
charge storage and hence high access latency. One can therefore reduce latency
by adapting the timing parameters to the current operating temperature and the
current DIMM that is being accessed. Using an FPGA-based testing platform, our
work first characterizes the extra margin for 115 DRAM modules from three major
manufacturers. The experimental results demonstrate that it is possible to
reduce four of the most critical timing parameters by a minimum/maximum of
17.3%/54.8% at 55C while maintaining reliable operation. AL-DRAM adaptively
selects between multiple different timing parameters for each DRAM module based
on its current operating condition. AL-DRAM does not require any changes to the
DRAM chip or its interface; it only requires multiple different timing
parameters to be specified and supported by the memory controller. Real system
evaluations show that AL-DRAM improves the performance of memory-intensive
workloads by an average of 14% without introducing any errors.

would otherwise be endangered. Multi-UAV systems can collaboratively complete
missions more efficiently and economically as compared to single UAV systems.
However, there are many issues to be resolved before effective use of UAVs can
be made to provide stable and reliable context-specific networks. Much of the
work carried out in the areas of Mobile Ad Hoc Networks (MANETs), and Vehicular
Ad Hoc Networks (VANETs) does not address the unique characteristics of the UAV
networks. UAV networks may vary from slow dynamic to dynamic; have intermittent
links and fluid topology. While it is believed that ad hoc mesh network would
be most suitable for UAV networks yet the architecture of multi-UAV networks
has been an understudied area. Software Defined Networking (SDN) could
facilitate flexible deployment and management of new services and help reduce
cost, increase security and availability in networks. Routing demands of UAV
networks go beyond the needs of MANETS and VANETS. Protocols are required that
would adapt to high mobility, dynamic topology, intermittent links, power
constraints and changing link quality. UAVs may fail and the network may get
partitioned making delay and disruption tolerance an important design
consideration. Limited life of the node and dynamicity of the network leads to
the requirement of seamless handovers where researchers are looking at the work
done in the areas of MANETs and VANETs, but the jury is still out. As energy
supply on UAVs is limited, protocols in various layers should contribute
towards greening of the network. This article surveys the work done towards all
of these outstanding issues, relating to this new class of networks, so as to
spur further research in these areas.

dynamical theories as an application of entropic methods of inference. In the
generic application of ED to derive the Schroedinger equation for N particles
the dynamics is a non-dissipative diffusion in which the system follows a
""Brownian"" trajectory with fluctuations superposed on a smooth drift. We show
that there is a family of ED models that differ at the ""microscopic"" or
sub-quantum level in that one can enhance or suppress the fluctuations relative
to the drift. Nevertheless, members of this family belong to the same
universality class in that they all lead to the same emergent Schroedinger
behavior at the ""macroscopic"" or quantum level. The model in which fluctuations
are totally suppressed is of particular interest: the system evolves along the
smooth lines of probability flow. Thus ED includes the Bohmian or causal form
of quantum mechanics as a special limiting case. We briefly explore a different
universality class -- a non-dissipative dynamics with microscopic fluctuations
but no quantum potential. The Bohmian limit of these hybrid models is
equivalent to classical mechanics. Finally we show that the Heisenberg
uncertainty relation is unaffected either by enhancing or suppressing
microscopic fluctuations or by switching off the quantum potential.

using control fields is a topic of prime interest. We consider BECs in the mean
field model of the Gross-Pitaevskii equation (GPE), which contains linear and
nonlinear features, both of which are subject to control. In this work we
report successful optimal control simulations of a one dimensional GPE by
modulating the linear and nonlinear terms to stimulate transitions into excited
coherent modes. The linear and nonlinear controls are allowed to freely vary
over space and time to seek their optimal forms. The determination of the
excited coherent modes targeted for optimization is numerically performed
through an adaptive imaginary time propagation method. Numerical simulations
are performed for optimal control of mode-to-mode transitions between the
ground coherent mode and excited modes of a BEC trapped in a harmonic well. The
results show greater than 99% success for nearly all trials utilizing
reasonable initial guesses for the controls, and analysis of the optimal
controls reveals primarily direct transitions between initial and target modes.
The success of using solely the nonlinearity term as a control opens up further
research toward exploring novel control mechanisms inaccessible to linear
Schr\""odinger-type systems.

expressive through weighted combination. This generality and simplicity in part
explains the success of the Expectation Maximization (EM) algorithm, in which
updates are easy to derive for a wide class of mixture models. However, the
likelihood of a mixture model is non-convex, so EM has no known global
convergence guarantees. Recently, method of moments approaches offer global
guarantees for some mixture models, but they do not extend easily to the range
of mixture models that exist. In this work, we present Polymom, an unifying
framework based on method of moments in which estimation procedures are easily
derivable, just as in EM. Polymom is applicable when the moments of a single
mixture component are polynomials of the parameters. Our key observation is
that the moments of the mixture model are a mixture of these polynomials, which
allows us to cast estimation as a Generalized Moment Problem. We solve its
relaxations using semidefinite optimization, and then extract parameters using
ideas from computer algebra. This framework allows us to draw insights and
apply tools from convex optimization, computer algebra and the theory of
moments to study problems in statistical estimation.

  We define a general update operation for planar graphs modeling the

incremental construction of an intersection of halfspaces in $\mathbb{R}^3$. We
show that the amortized number of edge insertions and removals needed to add a

bound is shown, even in the case where the graph of the diagram is a tree. This
contrasts with the $O(\log{n})$ upper bound of Aronov et al. (2006) for
farthest-point Voronoi diagrams when the points are inserted in order along
their convex hull.
  We present a semi-dynamic data structure that maintains the Voronoi diagram
of a set $S$ of $n$ sites in convex position. This structure supports the
insertion of a new site $p$ and finds the asymptotically minimal number $K$ of
edge insertions and removals needed to obtain the diagram of $S \cup \{p\}$

is $O(\sqrt{n}\;\mathrm{polylog}\ n)$ amortized by the aforementioned result.
  The most distinctive feature of this data structure is that the graph of the
Voronoi diagram is maintained at all times and can be traversed in the natural
way; this contrasts with other known data structures supporting nearest

current Voronoi diagram, which can, for example, be used to perform point

(SpIES); a large-area survey of 115 deg^2 in the Equatorial SDSS Stripe 82
field using Spitzer during its 'warm' mission phase. SpIES was designed to
probe sufficient volume to perform measurements of quasar clustering and the
luminosity function at z > 3 to test various models for ""feedback"" from active
galactic nuclei (AGN). Additionally, the wide range of available
multi-wavelength, multi-epoch ancillary data enables SpIES to identify both
high-redshift (z > 5) quasars as well as obscured quasars missed by optical
surveys. SpIES achieves 5{\sigma} depths of 6.13 {\mu}Jy (21.93 AB magnitude)
and 5.75 {\mu}Jy (22.0 AB magnitude) at 3.6 and 4.5 microns, respectively -
depths significantly fainter than WISE. We show that the SpIES survey recovers
a much larger fraction of spectroscopically-confirmed quasars (98%) in Stripe
82 than are recovered by WISE (55%). This depth is especially powerful at
high-redshift (z > 3.5), where SpIES recovers 94% of confirmed quasars, whereas
WISE only recovers 25%. Here we define the SpIES survey parameters and describe
the image processing, source extraction, and catalog production methods used to
analyze the SpIES data. In addition to this survey paper, we release 234 images
created by the SpIES team and three detection catalogs: a 3.6 {\mu}m-only
detection catalog containing 6.1 million sources, a 4.5 {\mu}m-only detection
catalog containing 6.5 million sources, and a dual-band detection catalog
containing 5.4 million sources.

additional internal (orbital) degree of freedom. The interaction between the
atoms depends on the orbital states, therefore four different scattering
channels can be identified in the system characterized by four independent
couplings. When the system is confined into a one-dimensional chain the
scattering lengths can be tuned by changing the transverse confinement, and
driven through four resonances. Using the new available experimental data of
the scattering lengths we analyze the phase diagram of the one-dimensional

populations of the two orbital states are changed. We found that three orders
compete showing power law decay: a state with dominant density wave
fluctuations, another one with spin density fluctuations, and a third one
characterized by exotic Fulde-Ferrell-Larkin-Ovchinnikov-like pairs consisting
one atom in the electronic ground state and one in the excited state. We also
show that sufficiently close to the resonances the compressibility of the
system starts to diverge indicating that the emerging order is unstable and
collapses to a phase separated state with a first order phase transition.

function collapse, where a quantum state associated with the action of field
theory evolves toward a final state that describes an IR fixed point. The
process of collapse is described by the radial evolution in the dual
holographic theory. If the theory is in the same phase as the assumed IR fixed
point, the initial state is smoothly projected to the final state. If in a
different phase, the initial state undergoes a phase transition which in turn
gives rise to a horizon in the bulk geometry. We demonstrate the connection
between critical behavior and horizon in an example, by deriving the bulk
metrics that emerge in various phases of the U(N) vector model in the large N
limit based on the holographic dual constructed from quantum RG. The gapped
phase exhibits a geometry that smoothly ends at a finite proper distance in the
radial direction. The geometric distance in the radial direction measures a
complexity : the depth of RG transformation that is needed to project the
generally entangled UV state to a direct product state in the IR. For gapless
states, entanglement persistently spreads out to larger length scales, and the
initial state can not be projected to the direct product state. The obstruction
to smooth projection at charge neutral point manifests itself as the long
throat in the anti-de Sitter space. The Poincare horizon at infinity marks the
critical point which exhibits a divergent length scale in the spread of
entanglement. For the gapless states with non-zero chemical potential, the bulk
space becomes the Lifshitz geometry with the dynamical critical exponent two.
The identification of horizon as critical point may provide an explanation for
the universality of horizon. We also discuss the structure of the bulk tensor
network that emerges from the quantum RG.

enough to ensure a low write error rate (WER), the probability that a bit will
remain unswitched after the write pulse is turned off, in the presence of
stochastic thermal effects. WERs on the scale of 10$^{-9}$ or lower are
desired. Within a macrospin approximation, WERs can be calculated analytically
using the Fokker-Planck method to this point and beyond. However, dynamic
micromagnetic effects within the bit can affect and lead to faster switching.
Such micromagnetic effects can be addressed via numerical solution of the
stochastic Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert-Slonczewski (LLGS) equation. However,
determining WERs approaching 10$^{-9}$ would require well over 10$^{9}$ such

stretching (turbulent amplification) at high ${\mathcal M}_{\rm A}$. For high
$\mathcal{M}_{\rm A}$, the $B$-field grows exponentially and saturates at
equipartition with turbulence, while the vorticity jumps sharply at the shock
and subsequently decays; the resulting field is orientated predominately along
the shock normal (an effect only apparent in 3D and not 2D). This agrees with
the radial field bias seen in supernova remnants. By contrast, for low
$\mathcal{M}_{\rm A}$, field amplification is mostly compressional, relatively
modest, and results in a predominantly perpendicular field. The latter is
consistent with the polarization seen in radio relics. Our results are
relatively robust to the assumed level of gas clumping. Our results imply that
the turbulent dynamo may be important for supernovae, but is only consistent
with the field strength, and not geometry, for cluster radio relics. For the
latter, this implies strong pre-existing $B$-fields in the ambient cluster
outskirts.

and derive self-consistent expressions of the posterior distribution of model
parameters. We apply Bayesian graphs to perform statistical analyses of Type Ia
supernova (SN Ia) luminosity distance measurements from the joint light-curve
analysis (JLA) data set. In contrast to the $\chi^2$ approach used in previous
studies, the Bayesian inference allows us to fully account for the
standard-candle parameter dependence of the data covariance matrix. Comparing
with $\chi^2$ analysis results, we find a systematic offset of the marginal
model parameter bounds. We demonstrate that the bias is statistically
significant in the case of the SN Ia standardization parameters with a maximal
6 $\sigma$ shift of the SN light-curve colour correction. In addition, we find
that the evidence for a host galaxy correction is now only 2.4 $\sigma$.
Systematic offsets on the cosmological parameters remain small, but may
increase by combining constraints from complementary cosmological probes. The
bias of the $\chi^2$ analysis is due to neglecting the parameter-dependent
log-determinant of the data covariance, which gives more statistical weight to
larger values of the standardization parameters. We find a similar effect on
compressed distance modulus data. To this end, we implement a fully consistent
compression method of the JLA data set that uses a Gaussian approximation of
the posterior distribution for fast generation of compressed data. Overall, the
results of our analysis emphasize the need for a fully consistent Bayesian
statistical approach in the analysis of future large SN Ia data sets.

mounting evidence that gas phase carbon is depleted in the disk around TW Hya.
Previous efforts to quantify this depletion have been hampered by uncertainties
regarding the radial thermal structure in the disk. Here we present resolved
ALMA observations of 13CO 3-2, C18O 3-2, 13CO 6-5, and C18O 6-5 emission in TW
Hya, which allow us to derive radial gas temperature and gas surface density
profiles, as well as map the CO abundance as a function of radius. These
observations provide a measurement of the surface CO snowline at ~30 AU and
show evidence for an outer ring of CO emission centered at 53 AU, a feature
previously seen only in less abundant species. Further, the derived CO gas
temperature profile constrains the freeze-out temperature of CO in the warm
molecular layer to < 21 K. Combined with the previous detection of HD 1-0,
these data constrain the surface density of the warm H2 gas in the inner ~30
AU. We find that CO is depleted by two orders of magnitude from R=10-60 AU,
with the small amount of CO returning to the gas phase inside the surface CO
snowline insufficient to explain the overall depletion. Finally, this new data
is used in conjunction with previous modeling of the TW Hya disk to constrain
the midplane CO snowline to 17-23 AU.

that greatly exceed the thermal broadening expected within molecular clouds.
These suprathermal CO linewidths are assumed to be originated from the presence
of unresolved supersonic motions inside clouds. Typically overlooked in the
literature, in this paper we aim to quantify the impact of the opacity
broadening effects on the current interpretation of the CO suprathermal line
profiles. Without any additional contributions to the gas velocity field, a
large fraction of the apparently supersonic (${\cal M}\sim$2-3) linewidths
measured in both $^{12}$CO and $^{13}$CO (J=1-0) lines can be explained by the
saturation of their corresponding sonic-like, optically-thin C$^{18}$O
counterparts assuming standard isotopic fractionation. Combined with the
presence of multiple components detected in our C$^{18}$O spectra, these
opacity effects seem to be also responsible of the highly supersonic linewidths
(${\cal M}>$8-10) detected in the broadest $^{12}$CO and $^{13}$CO spectra in
Taurus. Our results demonstrate that most of the suprathermal $^{12}$CO and
$^{13}$CO linewidths could be primarily created by a combination of opacity
broadening effects and multiple gas velocity components blended in these
saturated emission lines. Once corrected by their corresponding optical depth,
each of these gas components present transonic intrinsic linewidths
consistently traced by the three CO isotopologues within a factor of 2. Highly
correlated and velocity-coherent at large scales, the largest and highly
supersonic velocity differences inside clouds are generated by the relative
motions between individual gas components. This highly discretized structure of
the molecular gas traced in CO suggest that the gas dynamics inside molecular
clouds could be better described by the properties of a fully-resolved
macroscopic turbulence.

understanding the dust distribution in observed protoplanetary disks. However,
the mutual drag force between the gas and the particles can become so stiff,
particularly because of small particles and/or strong local solid
concentration, that an explicit integration of this system is computationally
formidable. In this work, we consider the integration of the mutual drag force
in a system of Eulerian gas and Lagrangian solid particles. Despite the
entanglement between the gas and the particles under the particle-mesh
construct, we are able to devise a numerical algorithm that effectively
decomposes the globally coupled system of equations for the mutual drag force
and makes it possible to integrate this system on a cell-by-cell basis, which
considerably reduces the computational task required. We use an analytical
solution for the temporal evolution of each cell to relieve the time-step
constraint posed by the mutual drag force as well as to achieve the highest
degree of accuracy. To validate our algorithm, we use an extensive suite of
benchmarks with known solutions in one, two, and three dimensions, including
the linear growth and the nonlinear saturation of the streaming instability. We
demonstrate numerical convergence and satisfactory consistency in all cases.
Our algorithm can for example be applied to model the evolution of the
streaming instability with mm/cm-sized pebbles at high mass loading, which has
important consequences for the formation scenarios of planetesimals.

constraints on progenitors from future observations, especially in cases where
detailed modeling of the entire rise is not practical. When comparing to

manifold of genus $g$, which can be bipartitioned in an arbitrary way. The
effects of fusion and braiding of Wilson lines can be also straightforwardly

line-of-sight velocity dispersion. This however is not true when the driving
scale of turbulence $L_f$, i.e. the outer scale of turbulence, is smaller than
the size of the system along the line of sight $L_{los}$. In fact, the
conventional Chandrasekhar-Fermi method over-estimates the strength of the mean
plane-of-the-sky magnetic field by a factor of $\sim \sqrt{ L_{los}/L_f}$. We
show that the standard deviation of centroid velocities divided by the average
line-of-sight velocity dispersion is a good measure of $\sqrt{ L_{los}/L_f}$,
which enables us to propose a modified Chandrasekhar-Fermi method.

have been two formulations for representing the various NS-NS
Bianchi-identities. In the first formulation, the standard three-form flux
($H_3$), the geometric flux ($\omega$) and the non-geometric fluxes ($Q$ and
$R$) are expressed by using the real six-dimensional indices (e.g. $H_{ijk},
\omega_{ij}{}^k, Q_i{}^{jk}$ and $R^{ijk}$), and this formulation has been
heavily utilized for simplifying the scalar potentials in
toroidal-orientifolds. On the other hand, relevant for the studies beyond
toroidal backgrounds, a second formulation is utilized in which all flux
components are written in terms of various involutively even/odd $(2,1)$- and
$(1,1)$-cohomologies of the complex threefold. In the lights of recent model
building interests and some observations made in arXiv:0705.3410 and
arXiv:0709.2186, in this article, we revisit two most commonly studied toroidal
examples in detail to illustrate that the present forms of these two
formulations are not completely equivalent. To demonstrate the same, we
translate all the identities of the first formulation into cohomology
ingredients, and after a tedious reshuffling of the subsequent constraints,
interestingly we find that all the identities of the second formulation are
embedded into the first formulation which has some additional constraints. In
addition, we look for the possible solutions of these Bianchi identities in a
detailed analysis, and we find that some solutions can reduce the size of
scalar potential very significantly, and in some cases are too strong to break
the no-scale structure completely. Finally, we also comment on the influence of
imposing some of the solutions of Bianchi identities in studying moduli
stabilization.

translate a Hamiltonian of $N$ spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ particles with 'all-to-all'

local parity constraints. LHZ used this mapping to propose a novel form of
quantum annealing. Here we provide a stabiliser-based formulation within which

Examples include a triangular array supporting all-to-all connectivity, and
moreover arrangements requiring only $2N$ or $N\log N$ spins but providing
interesting bespoke connectivities. Further examples show that arbitrarily high
order logical terms can be efficiently realised, even in a strictly 2D layout.
Our stabilisers can correspond to either even-parity constraints, as in the LHZ
proposal, or as odd-parity constraints. Considering the latter option applied
to the original LHZ layout, we note it may simplify the physical realisation
since the required ancillas are only spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ systems (i.e. qubits,
rather than qutrits) and moreover the interactions are very simple. We make a
preliminary assessment of the impact of this design choices by simulating small
(few-qubit) systems; we find some indications that the new variant may maintain
a larger minimum energy gap during the annealing process.

to be studied for all but the simplest chemical processes, DFT is to date the
only method that is computationally feasible. Here, we present a Bayesian
framework for DFT that allows for error estimation of calculated properties.
Since the optimal choice of parameters in present-day density functionals is
strongly system dependent, we advocate for a system-focused
re-parameterization. While, at first sight, this approach conflicts with the
first-principles character of DFT that should make it in principle system
independent, we deliberately introduce system dependence because we can then
assign a stochastically meaningful error to the system-dependent
parametrization that makes it non-arbitrary. By re-parameterizing a functional
that was derived on a sound physical basis to a chemical system of interest we
obtain a functional that yields reliable confidence intervals for reaction
energies. We demonstrate our approach at the example of catalytic nitrogen

treated the current balance condition as independent of grain size. However,
for small grains, as they are often observed in space environments, a
dependence on grain size is expected due to secondary electron emission (SEE).
Here, by the term ""small"" we mean a particle size comparable to the typical
penetration depth for given primary electron energy. The results are relevant
for the dynamics of small, charged dust particles emitted by the volcanic moon
Io, which form the Jovian dust streams. We revise the theory of charging of
small (sub-micron sized) micrometeoroids to take into account a high production
of secondary electrons for small grains immersed in an isotropic flux of
electrons. We apply our model to obtain an improved estimate for the charge of
the dust streams leaving the Jovian system, detected by several spacecraft. For
the Jupiter plasma environment we derive the surface potential of grains
composed of NaCl (believed to be the major constituent of Jovian dust stream
particles) or silicates. For small particles the potential depends on grain
size and the secondary electron current induces a sensitivity to material
properties. As a result of the small particle effect, the estimates for the
charging times and for the fractional charge fluctuations of NaCl grains
obtained using our general approach to SEE give results qualitatively different
from the analogous estimates derived from the traditional approach to SEE. We
find that for the charging environment considered in this paper field emission
does not limit the charging of NaCl grains.

phase field formulation of the optimal control problem, hence exploiting the
well developed mathematical theory for the optimal control of semilinear
parabolic partial differential equations. Approximation of the resulting
optimal control problem is computationally challenging, requiring massive
amounts of computational time and memory storage. The main focus of this work
is to propose, derive, implement and test an efficient solution method for such

based upon a geometric multigrid method incorporating advanced techniques to
deal with the nonlinearities in the problem and utilising adaptive mesh
refinement. An in-house two-grid solution strategy for the forward and adjoint
problems, that significantly reduces memory requirements and CPU time, is
proposed and investigated computationally. Furthermore, parallelisation as well
as an adaptivestep gradient update for the control are employed to further
improve efficiency. Along with a detailed description of our proposed solution
method together with its implementation we present a number of computational
results that demonstrate and evaluate our algorithms with respect to accuracy

sources opens new perspectives in the investigation of the ultrafast dynamics
of physical and chemical processes at the surfaces and interfaces of solids.
Nevertheless, for very intense photon pulses a large number of photoelectrons
are simultaneously emitted and their mutual Coulomb repulsion is sufficiently
strong to significantly modify their trajectory and kinetic energy. This
phenomenon, referred as space-charge effect, determines a broadening and shift
in energy for the typical PES structures and a dramatic loss of energy
resolution. In this article we examine the effects of space charge in PES with
a particular focus on time-resolved hard X-ray (~10 keV) experiments. The
trajectory of the electrons photoemitted from pure Cu in a hard X-ray PES
experiment has been reproduced through $N$-body simulations and the broadening
of the photoemission core-level peaks has been monitored as a function of
various parameters (photons per pulse, linear dimension of the photon spot,
photon energy). The energy broadening results directly proportional to the
number $N$ of electrons emitted per pulse (mainly represented by secondary
electrons) and inversely proportional to the linear dimension $a$ of the photon
spot on the sample surface, in agreement with the literature data about
ultraviolet and soft X-ray experiments. The evolution in time of the energy
broadening during the flight of the photoelectrons is also studied. Despite its
detrimental consequences on the energy spectra, we found that space charge has
negligible effects on the momentum distribution of photoelectrons and a
momentum broadening is not expected to affect angle-resolved experiments.
Strategy to reduce the energy broadening and the feasibility of hard X-ray PES
experiments at the new free-electron laser facilities are discussed.

deadlock-free even when robots are subject to delaying disturbances. Our

differentials are Borel functions, higher order rectifiability of the set of
differentiability points, and a Rademacher result. One concept is characterised

wellbeing. Wealthy countries have high-quality vital registration systems, but
poor countries lack this infrastructure and must rely on estimates that are
often problematic. In this paper, we introduce the network survival method, a
new approach for estimating adult death rates. We derive the precise conditions
under which it produces estimates that are consistent and unbiased. Further, we
develop an analytical framework for sensitivity analysis. To assess the
performance of the network survival method in a realistic setting, we conducted
a nationally-representative survey experiment in Rwanda (n=4,669). Network
survival estimates were similar to estimates from other methods, even though
the network survival estimates were made with substantially smaller samples and
are based entirely on data from Rwanda, with no need for model life tables or
pooling of data from other countries. Our analytic results demonstrate that the
network survival method has attractive properties, and our empirical results
show that it can be used in countries where reliable estimates of adult death
rates are sorely needed.

understanding events in a large field of view. Most approaches aim to associate
detections from frame differencing into tracks. However, slow or stopped
vehicles result in long-term missing detections and further cause tracking
discontinuities. Relying merely on appearance clue to recover missing
detections is difficult as targets are extremely small and in grayscale. In
this paper, we address the limitations of detection association methods by
coupling it with a local context tracker (LCT), which does not rely on motion
detections. On one hand, our LCT learns neighboring spatial relation and tracks
each target in consecutive frames using graph optimization. It takes the
advantage of context constraints to avoid drifting to nearby targets. We
generate hypotheses from sparse and dense flow efficiently to keep solutions
tractable. On the other hand, we use detection association strategy to extract
short tracks in batch processing. We explicitly handle merged detections by
generating additional hypotheses from them. Our evaluation on wide area aerial
imagery sequences shows significant improvement over state-of-the-art methods.

that the trajectory of the optimal solution can be asymptotically tracked by a

continuous evaluation of the gradient and the inverse Hessian of the objective

draw inspiration from self-triggered control to propose a strategy that
autonomously adapts the times at which it makes computations about the

the approach, however, is its generative nature. Specifically, its performance
is tightly coupled with how well the linear model can synthesize appearance
from geometric displacement, even though the alignment task itself is
associated with the inverse problem. In this paper, we present a new approach,
referred to as the Conditional LK algorithm, which: (i) directly learns linear
models that predict geometric displacement as a function of appearance, and
(ii) employs a novel strategy for ensuring that the generative pixel
independence assumption can still be taken advantage of. We demonstrate that
our approach exhibits superior performance to classical generative forms of the
LK algorithm. Furthermore, we demonstrate its comparable performance to
state-of-the-art methods such as the Supervised Descent Method with

originates from the combination of the projection of correlated structures

covariance between tSZ and WL signals. We present a statistical model to

Neptunian worlds, Jovian worlds and stars. Our classification identifies dwarf

to infer the unrevealed connections. Most existing approaches derive a
likelihood and attempt to find the network topology maximizing the likelihood,
a problem that is highly intractable. In this paper, we focus on the network

exemplified by a network diffusion scheme called respondent-driven sampling

the posterior distribution of an observed RDS realization is a Bayesian

electric field due to the Hall voltage is taken into consideration. We find the
ground state where the electron configuration is uniquely determined so as to
have the minimum classical Coulomb energy. Residual Coulomb interaction HI
yields quantum transitions which satisfy the momentum conservation along the
current direction. The number of Coulomb transitions from nearest electron
pairs is dependent sensitively upon the fractional number of the filling
factor. For example, the number u(2/3) of allowed transitions at nu=2/3
abruptly decreases when the filling factor nu deviates slightly from 2/3. The
limiting value of the number is equal to half of u(2/3). The discontinuous
behavior produces the valley structure in the energy spectrum. This mechanism
produces the Hall plateaus at the specific filling factors nu=1/(2j+1), 2j
/(2j+1), j/(2j+1), j/(2j-1) etc. and also at the non-standard filling factors
nu=7/11, 4/11, 4/13, 5/13, 5/17, 6/17 etc. We have studied the pair energies of
more distant electron pairs in Chapter 5. Thereby the small valley structure
yields at nu=5/2, 7/2 and so on. The shapes of polarization curves depend
mainly upon the numerator of the fractional filling factor in nu<1 because the
spin polarization belongs to electrons only. There are many spin-arrangements
with the same eigen-energy of HD. The Coulomb interaction HI yields quantum
transitions among these degenerate ground states. The partial Hamiltonian has
been diagonalized exactly. The eigen-states give the spin polarization versus
magnetic field strength. The theoretical curves of the spin polarization are in
good agreement with the experimental data as studied in Chapter 9. Thus the

application of Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) from the traditional fields
of aerodynamics and hydrodynamics to a number of new areas. Examples range from
the heat and fluid flows in nuclear reactor vessels and in data centers to the
turbulence flows through wind turbine farms and coastal vegetation plants.
However, in these new applications complex structures are often exist (e.g.,
rod bundles in reactor vessels and turbines in wind farms), which makes fully
resolved, first-principle based CFD modeling prohibitively expensive. This
obstacle seriously impairs the predictive capability of CFD models in these
applications. On the other hand, a limited amount of measurement data is often
available in the systems in the above-mentioned applications. In this work we
propose a data-driven, physics-based approach to perform full field inversion
on the effects of the complex structures on the flow. This is achieved by
assimilating observation data and numerical model prediction in an iterative
Ensemble Kalman method. Based on the inversion results, the velocity and
turbulence of the flow field can be obtained. A major novelty of the present
contribution is the non-parametric, full field inversion approach adopted,
which is in contrast to the inference of coefficient in the ad hoc models often
practiced in previous works. The merits of the proposed approach are
demonstrated on the flow past a porous disk by using both synthetic data and
real experimental measurements. The spatially varying drag forces of the porous
disk on the flow are inferred. The proposed approach has the potential to be
used in the monitoring of complex system in the above mentioned applications.

accreting neutron stars are compressed to high density where they freeze,
forming the outer crust of the star. We calculate the chemical separation on
freezing for a number of different nuclear mixtures resulting from a range of
burning conditions for the rp-process. We confirm the generic result that light
nuclei are preferentially retained in the liquid and heavy nuclei in the solid.
This is in agreement with the previous study of a 17-component mixture of
rp-process ashes by Horowitz et al. (2007), but extends that result to a much
larger range of compositions. We also find an alternate phase separation regime
for the lightest ash mixtures which does not demonstrate this generic
behaviour. With a few exceptions, we find that chemical separation reduces the
expected $Q_{\rm imp}$ in the outer crust compared to the initial rp-process
ash, where $Q_{\rm imp}$ measures the mean-square dispersion in atomic number
$Z$ of the nuclei in the mixture. We find that the fractional spread of $Z$
plays a role in setting the amount of chemical separation and is strongly
correlated to the divergence between the two/three-component approximations and
the full component model. The contrast in $Y_e$ between the initial rp-process
ashes and the equilibrium liquid composition is similar to that assumed in
earlier two-component models of compositionally driven convection, except for
very light compositions which produce nearly negligible convective driving. We
discuss the implications of these results for observations of accreting neutron

analytically and numerically demonstrate that the non-equilibrium steady-state

highly asymmetric with a longitudinal correlation length that diverges linearly
with the flow speed and a transverse correlation length that approaches a
finite velocity-independent value. Linear response theory is developed to study
the statistics of the steady states. Theoretical predictions show excellent
agreement with the numerical steady states of the generalized FKPP equation

for f(R) gravity we compute predictions based on the model parameters. We show
that the mass-temperature relation, for screened modified gravities, is
significantly different from that of standard gravity for the less massive and
colder galaxy clusters, while being indistinguishable from Einstein's gravity
at massive, hot galaxy clusters. We further investigate the mass-temperature
relation for other mass estimates than the thermal mass estimate, and discover
that the gas mass-temperature results show an even more significant deviations
from Einstein's gravity than the thermal mass-temperature.

the interaction among the Secondary Users (SUs) as a stochastic game. By
allowing the backward propagation of the path utility information from the

stage games. The best-response policies are learned through the process of
smooth fictitious play, which is guaranteed to converge without flooding of the
information about the local utilities and behaviors. To address the problem of
mixed insider attacks with both routing-toward-primary and sink-hole attacks,
the trustworthiness of the neighbor nodes is evaluated through a multi-arm
bandit process for each SU. The simulation results show that the proposed
routing algorithm is able to enforce the cooperation of the malicious SUs and
reduce the negative impact of the attacks on the routing selection process.

Although odor reproduction systems are still far from being viable, the

aspects of the flare phenomenon, from the spatial distribution of hard X-ray
emission to global energetics. Motivated by recent {\em RHESSI} observations
that point to the existence of a mechanism that confines electrons to the
coronal parts of flare loops more effectively than Coulomb collisions, we here
consider the impact of pitch-angle scattering off turbulent magnetic
fluctuations on the parallel transport of electrons in flaring coronal loops.
It is shown that the presence of such a scattering mechanism in addition to
Coulomb collisional scattering can significantly reduce the parallel thermal
and electrical conductivities relative to their collisional values. We provide
illustrative expressions for the resulting thermoelectric coefficients that
relate the thermal flux and electrical current density to the temperature
gradient and the applied electric field. We then evaluate the effect of these
modified transport coefficients on the flare coronal temperature that can be
attained, on the post-impulsive-phase cooling of heated coronal plasma, and on
the importance of the beam-neutralizing return current on both ambient heating
and the energy loss rate of accelerated electrons. We also discuss the possible
ways in which anomalous transport processes have an impact on the required
overall energy associated with accelerated electrons in solar flares.

that results from core-mantle differentiation. The accretional collisions
involved in forming the terrestrial planets of the inner Solar System have been
calculated by previous studies using N-body accretion simulations. Here we use
the output from such simulations to determine the volumes of melt produced and
thus the pressure and temperature conditions of metal-silicate equilibration,
after each impact, as Earth-like planets accrete. For these calculations a
parametrised melting model is used that takes impact velocity, impact angle and
the respective masses of the impacting bodies into account. The evolution of
metal-silicate equilibration pressures (as defined by evolving magma ocean
depths) during Earth's accretion depends strongly on the lifetime of
impact-generated magma oceans compared to the time interval between large
impacts. In addition, such results depend on starting parameters in the N-body
simulations, such as the number and initial mass of embryos. Thus, there is the
potential for combining the results, such as those presented here, with
multistage core formation models to better constrain the accretional history of
the Earth.

the $y$-axis, typically encapsulated by its (co)variation around a mean level.
In contrast, its phase variation refers to fluctuations in the $x$-axis, often
caused by random time changes. We formalise similar notions for a point
process, and nonparametrically separate them based on realisations of i.i.d.
copies $\{\Pi_i\}$ of the phase-varying point process. A key element in our
approach is to demonstrate that when the classical phase variation assumptions
of Functional Data Analysis (FDA) are applied to the point process case, they
become equivalent to conditions interpretable through the prism of the theory
of optimal transportation of measure. We demonstrate that these induce a
natural Wasserstein geometry tailored to the warping problem, including a
formal notion of bias expressing over-registration. Within this framework, we
construct nonparametric estimators that tend to avoid over-registration in
finite samples. We show that they consistently estimate the warp maps,
consistently estimate the structural mean, and consistently register the warped
point processes, even in a sparse sampling regime. We also establish
convergence rates, and derive $\sqrt{n}$-consistency and a central limit

pixel data. This presents a challenge for feedforward networks: lower layers in
convolutional nets capture rich spatial information, while upper layers encode
object-level knowledge but are invariant to factors such as pose and
appearance. In this work we propose to augment feedforward nets for object
segmentation with a novel top-down refinement approach. The resulting
bottom-up/top-down architecture is capable of efficiently generating
high-fidelity object masks. Similarly to skip connections, our approach
leverages features at all layers of the net. Unlike skip connections, our
approach does not attempt to output independent predictions at each layer.
Instead, we first output a coarse `mask encoding' in a feedforward pass, then
refine this mask encoding in a top-down pass utilizing features at successively
lower layers. The approach is simple, fast, and effective. Building on the
recent DeepMask network for generating object proposals, we show accuracy
improvements of 10-20% in average recall for various setups. Additionally, by
optimizing the overall network architecture, our approach, which we call
SharpMask, is 50% faster than the original DeepMask network (under .8s per
image).

that the neutrino decay provides an enhancement of the expected tau appearance

OFDM-Offset Quadrature Amplitude Modulation (OFDM/OQAM) based on the PHYDYAS

actual interference injected by OFDM/OQAM systems onto CP-OFDM is much higher

  Definition and Quantification",,,,,"stat.ML cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Brain decoding is a popular multivariate approach for hypothesis testing in
neuroimaging. It is well known that the brain maps derived from weights of
linear classifiers are hard to interpret because of high correlations between
predictors, low signal to noise ratios, and the high dimensionality of
neuroimaging data. Therefore, improving the interpretability of brain decoding
approaches is of primary interest in many neuroimaging studies. Despite
extensive studies of this type, at present, there is no formal definition for
interpretability of multivariate brain maps. As a consequence, there is no
quantitative measure for evaluating the interpretability of different brain
decoding methods. In this paper, first, we present a theoretical definition of
interpretability in brain decoding; we show that the interpretability of
multivariate brain maps can be decomposed into their reproducibility and
representativeness. Second, as an application of the proposed theoretical
definition, we formalize a heuristic method for approximating the
interpretability of multivariate brain maps in a binary magnetoencephalography
(MEG) decoding scenario. Third, we propose to combine the approximated
interpretability and the performance of the brain decoding model into a new
multi-objective criterion for model selection. Our results for the MEG data
show that optimizing the hyper-parameters of the regularized linear classifier
based on the proposed criterion results in more informative multivariate brain
maps. More importantly, the presented definition provides the theoretical
background for quantitative evaluation of interpretability, and hence,
facilitates the development of more effective brain decoding algorithms in the
future.

are functionals of the states of the studied systems. The proposed method does
not require the approximation of solutions nor the stability of trajectories.
In the case of SDEs, the formulation relies on a generalized version of the
Feynman-Kac formula and results in moments bounds for nonlinear SDEs.
Furthermore, we show that the analysis problems can be cast as optimization
problems and can be solved by semi-definite programming.

  Online advertising currently supports some of the most important Internet

overcome privacy concerns, it has been suggested to introduce user information
markets through information brokers into the online advertising ecosystem. Such
markets give users control over which data get shared in the online advertising

non-negativity and sum-to-one constraints resulting from the intrinsic physical
properties of the abundances are introduced as prior information to regularize
this ill-posed problem. The joint fusion and unmixing problem is then
formulated as maximizing the joint posterior distribution with respect to the
endmember signatures and abundance maps, This optimization problem is attacked
with an alternating optimization strategy. The two resulting sub-problems are
convex and are solved efficiently using the alternating direction method of

to a heavier atom. They are fundamental precursor molecules in cosmic chemistry
and many hydride ions have become observable in high quality for the first time
thanks to the Herschel Space Observatory. Ionized hydrides, such as CH+ and
OH+, and also HCO+ that affect the chemistry of molecules such as water,
provide complementary information on irradiation by far UV (FUV) or X-rays and
gas temperature. The targeted lines of CH+, OH+, H2O+, C+ and CH are detected
mostly in blue-shifted absorption. H3O+ and SH+ are detected in emission and
only toward some high-mass objects. The observed line parameters and
correlations suggest two different origins, related to gas entrained by the
outflows and to the circumstellar envelope. The column density ratios of
CH+/OH+ are estimated from chemical slab models, assuming that the H2 density
is given by the specific density model of each object at the beam radius. For
the low-mass YSOs the observed ratio can be reproduced for an FUV flux of 2-400
times the ISRF at the location of the molecules. In two high-mass objects, the
UV flux is 20-200 times the ISRF derived from absorption lines, and 300-600
ISRF using emission lines. If the FUV flux required for low-mass objects
originates at the central protostar, a substantial FUV luminosity, up to 1.5
L_sun, is required. There is no molecular evidence for X-ray induced chemistry
in the low-mass objects on the observed scales of a few 1000 AU. For high-mass
regions, the FUV flux required to produce the observed molecular ratios is
smaller than the unattenuated flux expected from the central object(s) at the
Herschel beam radius. This is consistent with an FUV flux reduced by
circumstellar extinction or by bloating of the protostar.

can be accomplished by cascading metasurfaces (thin composite layers) that are

complete the full set of functionalities for wave control, we synthesize
transmitarrays that tailor transmission in a desired way, being ""invisible""

broad emission-line variations decorrelated for ~60 to 70 days, starting ~75
days after the first HST/COS observation. Following this anomalous state, the
flux and variability of the broad emission lines returned to a more normal
state. This transient behavior, characterised by significant deficits in flux
and equivalent width of the strong broad UV emission lines, is the first of its
kind to be unambiguously identified in an active galactic nucleus reverberation
mapping campaign. The largest corresponding emission-line flux deficits
occurred for the high-ionization collisionally excited lines, C IV and Si IV(+O
IV]), and also He II(+O III]), while the anomaly in Ly-alpha was substantially
smaller. This pattern of behavior indicates a depletion in the flux of photons
with E_{\rm ph} > 54 eV, relative to those near 13.6 eV. We suggest two
plausible mechanisms for the observed behavior: (i) temporary obscuration of
the ionizing continuum incident upon BLR clouds by a moving veil of material
lying between the inner accretion disk and inner BLR, perhaps resulting from an
episodic ejection of material from the disk, or (ii) a temporary change in the
intrinsic ionizing continuum spectral energy distribution resulting in a
deficit of ionizing photons with energies > 54 eV, possibly due to a transient
restructuring of the Comptonizing atmosphere above the disk. Current evidence
appears to favor the latter explanation.

$\sigma$, in which at the emergence of the phase transition the system transits
between active and absorbing regimes. In contrast to the spatial disorder,
numerical results strongly suggest that temporal disorder does not forbid the
existence of discontinuous transition. All cases are signed by behaviors
similar to their pure (without disorder) counterparts, including bistability
around the coexistence point and common finite size scaling behavior with the
inverse of the system volume, as recently proposed in Phys. Rev. E. {\bf 92},

angular momentum between a conduction electron and a local magnetic moment
through the exchange coupling. However, the same coupling can transfer not only
spin but also energy, though the latter transfer mechanism has been largely
ignored. Here we report on experimental evidence concerning the energy transfer
in ferromagnet/heavy metal bilayers. The magnetoresistance (MR) is found to
depend significantly on the current direction down to low in-plane currents,
for which STT cannot play any significant role. Instead we find that the
observed MR is consistent with the energy transfer mechanism through the
quantum spin-flip process, which predicts short wavelength,
current-direction-dependent magnon excitations in the THz frequency range. Our

challenging. A promising research direction is zero-shot learning, which does
not require any training data to recognize new classes, but rather relies on
some form of auxiliary information describing the new classes. Ultimately, this
may allow to use textbook knowledge that humans employ to learn about new
classes by transferring knowledge from classes they know well. The most
successful zero-shot learning approaches currently require a particular type of
auxiliary information -- namely attribute annotations performed by humans --
that is not readily available for most classes. Our goal is to circumvent this
bottleneck by substituting such annotations by extracting multiple pieces of
information from multiple unstructured text sources readily available on the
web. To compensate for the weaker form of auxiliary information, we incorporate
stronger supervision in the form of semantic part annotations on the classes
from which we transfer knowledge. We achieve our goal by a joint embedding
framework that maps multiple text parts as well as multiple semantic parts into

with few-body physics. There are important open questions like the question of
antikaon nuclear bound states. A unique and rather direct experimental access
to the antikaon-nucleon scattering lengths is provided by precision X-ray
spectroscopy of transitions in low-lying states of light kaonic atoms like
kaonic hydrogen isotopes. In the SIDDHARTA experiment at the electron-positron
collider DAFNE of LNF-INFN we measured the most precise values of the strong
interaction observables, i.e. the strong interaction on the 1s ground state of
the electromagnetically bound kaonic hydrogen atom leading to a hadronic shift
and a hadronic broadening of the 1s state. The SIDDHARTA result triggered new
theoretical work which achieved major progress in the understanding of the
low-energy strong interaction with strangeness. Antikaon-nucleon scattering
lengths have been calculated constrained by the SIDDHARTA data on kaonic
hydrogen. For the extraction of the isospin-dependent scattering lengths a
measurement of the hadronic shift and width of kaonic deuterium is necessary.
Therefore, new X-ray studies with the focus on kaonic deuterium are in
preparation (SIDDHARTA2). Many improvements in the experimental setup will
allow to measure kaonic deuterium which is challenging due to the anticipated
low X-ray yield. Especially important are the data on the X-ray yields of

are detected. Moreover, we investigated the previous outbursts from this

2010 outburst of the source. Comparing the updated set of orbital parameters,
in particular the value of the time of passage from the ascending node, with
the orbital solutions reported from the previous outbursts, we estimated for
the first time the orbital period derivative corresponding with
$\dot{P}_{orb}=(1.1\pm0.3)\times 10^{-10}$ s/s. We note that this value is
significant at 3.5 sigma confidence level, because of significant fluctuations
with respect to the parabolic trend and more observations are needed in order
to confirm the finding. Assuming the reliability of the result, we suggest that
the large value of the orbital-period derivative can be explained as a result
of an highly non-conservative mass transfer driven by emission of gravitational
waves, which implies the ejection of matter from a region close to the inner
Lagrangian point. We also discuss possible alternative explanations.

that ensembles of random graphs are non-equivalent when the degrees of the

either on a single layer (uni-partite graphs) or on two layers (bi-partite

intra-connected and inter-connected layers, thus allowing for modular graphs

full classification of ensemble equivalence, proving that breakdown occurs if

understood despite many analytic and numerical work. Recently, a new idea has
been proposed that local density enhancements (waklets) arising in the galactic

understanding of this mechanism is not yet sufficient. We analyze the
interaction of wakelets by using N-body simulations including perturbing point
masses, which are heavier than individual N-body particles and act as the seeds
for wakelets. Our simulation facilitates more straightforward interpretation of
numerical results than previous work by putting a certain number of perturbers
in a well-motivated configuration. We detected a clear sign of non-linear
interaction between wakelets, which make global spiral arms by connecting two
adjacent wakelets. We found that the wave number of the strongest non-linear
interaction depends on galactic disk mass and shear rate. This dependence is
consistent with the prediction of swing amplification mechanism and other
previous results. Our results provide unification of previous results which

important problem for a large variety of applications. One application of
particular interest is network applications that manipulate or reason about
complex message structures, such as XML messages. This paper presents a
decision procedure for reasoning about algebraic data types using abstractions
that are provided by catamorphisms: fold functions that map instances of
algebraic data types to values in a decidable domain. We show that the
procedure is sound and complete for a class of catamorphisms that satisfy a
generalized sufficient surjectivity condition. Our work extends a previous
decision procedure that unrolls catamorphism functions until a solution is
found.
  We use the generalized sufficient surjectivity condition to address an
incompleteness in the previous unrolling algorithm (and associated proof). We
then propose the categories of monotonic and associative catamorphisms, which
we argue provide a more intuitive inclusion test than the generalized
sufficient surjectivity condition. We use these notions to address two open
problems from previous work: (1) we provide a bound, with respect to formula
size, on the number of unrollings necessary for completeness, showing that it
is linear for monotonic catamorphisms and exponentially small for associative
catamorphisms, and (2) we demonstrate that associative catamorphisms can be
combined within a formula while preserving completeness. Our combination
results extend the set of problems that can be reasoned about using the
catamorphism-based approach.
  We also describe an implementation of the approach, called RADA, which
accepts formulas in an extended version of the SMT-LIB 2.0 syntax. The
procedure is quite general and is central to the reasoning infrastructure for
Guardol, a domain-specific language for reasoning about network guards.

independent of whether they are computed in a weakly coupled quantum (or
thermal) field theory, hydrodynamics, or at infinite coupling from holography.
While the presence of dynamical gauge fields and mixed, gauge-global anomalies
can destroy this universality, in their absence, the non-renormalisation of
anomalous Ward identities is expected to be obeyed at all intermediate coupling
strengths. In holography, bulk theories with higher-derivative corrections
incorporate coupling constant corrections to the boundary theory observables in
an expansion around infinite coupling. In this work, we investigate the
coupling constant dependence and universality of anomalous conductivities (and
thus of the anomalous Ward identities) in general, four-dimensional systems
that possess asymptotically anti-de Sitter holographic duals with a
non-extremal black brane in five dimensions, and anomalous transport introduced
into the boundary theory via the bulk Chern-Simons action. We show that in bulk
theories with arbitrary gauge- and diffeomorphism-invariant higher-derivative
actions, anomalous conductivities, which can incorporate an infinite series of
(inverse) coupling constant corrections, remain universal. Owing to the
existence of the membrane paradigm, the proof reduces to a construction of bulk
effective theories at the horizon and the boundary. It only requires us to
impose the condition of horizon regularity and correct boundary conditions on
the fields. We also discuss ways to violate the universality by violating
conditions for the validity of the membrane paradigm, in particular, by adding
mass to the vector fields (a case with a mixed, gauge-global anomaly) and in
bulk geometries with a naked singularity.

based on the probabilistic method. To prove the existence of a good object, we
pick a random object and show that it is bad with low probability. This method
is effective, but the underlying probabilistic machinery can be daunting.
""Encoding arguments"" provide an alternative presentation in which probabilistic
reasoning is encapsulated in a ""uniform encoding lemma"". This lemma provides an
upper bound on the probability of an event using the fact that a uniformly
random choice from a set of size $n$ cannot be encoded with fewer than $\log_2
n$ bits on average. With the lemma, the argument reduces to devising an
encoding where bad objects have short codewords.
  In this expository article, we describe the basic method and provide a simple
tutorial on how to use it. After that, we survey many applications to classic
problems from discrete mathematics and computer science. We also give a
generalization for the case of non-uniform distributions, as well as a rigorous
justification for the use of non-integer codeword lengths in encoding
arguments. These latter two results allow encoding arguments to be applied more
widely and to produce tighter results.

These new Boussinesq equations are not the classical Boussinesq equations. A
new term due to the vorticity and the Coriolis forcing appears that can not be

different asymptotic models when the bottom is flat : a linear equation linked
to the Klein-Gordon equation admitting the so-called Poincar{\'e} waves; the
Ostrovsky equation, which is a generalization of the KdV equation in presence
of a Coriolis forcing, when the rotation is weak; and finally the KdV equation
when the rotation is very weak. Therefore, this work provides the first
mathematical justification of the Ostrovsky equation. Finally, we derive a
generalization of the Green-Naghdi equations in 1D in space for small
topography variations and we show that this model is consistent with the water

phenomena of free electrons in conventional Ge/Si heterojunctions have proved
to be elusive because of epitaxy constraints and an unfavourable band

dimensional electron gas (2DEG) confined in quantum wells of pure Ge grown on
SiGe-buffered Si substrates. These epitaxial systems demonstrate exceptionally
long spin relaxation and coherence times, eventually unveiling the potential of
Ge in bridging the gap between spintronic concepts and semiconductor device

  Revision of Abstract Argumentation Frameworks",,,,,"cs.AI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In this paper, we present a preliminary work on an approach to fill the gap
between logic-based argumentation and the numerous approaches to tackle the
dynamics of abstract argumentation frameworks. Our idea is that, even when
arguments and attacks are defined by means of a logical belief base, there may
be some uncertainty about how accurate is the content of an argument, and so
the presence (or absence) of attacks concerning it. We use enthymemes to
illustrate this notion of uncertainty of arguments and attacks. Indeed, as
argued in the literature, real arguments are often enthymemes instead of
completely specified deductive arguments. This means that some parts of the
pair (support, claim) may be missing because they are supposed to belong to
some ""common knowledge"", and then should be deduced by the agent which receives
the enthymeme. But the perception that agents have of the common knowledge may
be wrong, and then a first agent may state an enthymeme that her opponent is
not able to decode in an accurate way. It is likely that the decoding of the
enthymeme by the agent leads to mistaken attacks between this new argument and
the existing ones. In this case, the agent can receive some information about
attacks or arguments acceptance statuses which disagree with her argumentation
framework. We exemplify a way to incorporate this new piece of information by
means of existing works on the dynamics of abstract argumentation frameworks.

to study accretion flows. Various investigations of this system and of other
black holes have not, however, led to an agreement on the accretion flow
geometry or on the seed photon source for Comptonization during different
stages of X-ray outbursts. We place constraints on these accretion flow
properties by studying long-term spectral variations of this source. Methods.
We performed phenomenological and self-consistent broad band spectral modeling
of Swift J1753.5-0127 using quasi-simultaneous archived data from
INTEGRAL/ISGRI, Swift/UVOT/XRT/BAT, RXTE/PCA/HEXTE and MAXI/GSC instruments.
Results. We identify a critical flux limit, F \sim 1.5 \times 10^{-8}
erg/cm^2/s, and show that the spectral properties of SWIFT J1753.5-0127 are
markedly different above and below this value. Above the limit, during the
outburst peak, the hot medium seems to intercept roughly 50 percent of the disk
emission. Below it, in the outburst tail, the contribution of the disk photons
reduces significantly and the entire spectrum from the optical to X-rays can be
produced by a synchrotron-self-Compton mechanism. The long-term variations in
the hard X-ray spectra are caused by erratic changes of the electron
temperatures in the hot medium. Thermal Comptonization models indicate
unreasonably low hot medium optical depths during the short incursions into the
soft state after 2010, suggesting that non-thermal electrons produce the
Comptonized tail in this state. The soft X-ray excess, likely produced by the
accretion disk, shows peculiarly stable temperatures for over an order of
magnitude changes in flux. Conclusions. The long-term spectral trends of SWIFT
J1753.5-0127 are likely set by variations of the truncation radius and a
formation of a hot, quasi-spherical inner flow in the vicinity of the black
hole. (abridged)

boson at the LHC. This mode or the more general diboson modes may also play an
important role in probing for new physics beyond the SM. In this paper, we
consider the possibility that a diphoton resonance is due to a composite
(pseudo)scalar boson, whose constituents are either new hyperquarks Q or scalar
hyperquarks tilde{Q} confined by a new hypercolor force at a confinement scale
Lambda_h. Assuming the mass m_Q (or m_{tilde Q}) >> Lambda_h, a diphoton
resonance could be interpreted as either a Q bar{Q} state eta_Q with J^{PC} =
0^{-+} or a tilde{Q} tilde{Q}^dagger state eta_{tilde Q} with J^{PC}=0^{++}.
For the Q bar{Q} scenario, there will be a spin-triplet partner psi_Q which is
slightly heavier than eta_Q due to the hyperfine interactions mediated by
hypercolor gluon exchange; while for the tilde{Q} tilde{Q}^dagger scenario, the
spin-triplet partner chi_{tilde Q} arises from higher radial excitation with
nonzero orbital angular momentum. We consider productions and decays of eta_Q,
eta_{tilde Q}, psi_Q, and chi_{tilde Q} at the LHC using the NRQCD
factorization approach. We discuss how to test these scenarios by using the DY
process and the forward dijet azimuthal angular distributions to determine the
J^{PC} quantum number of the diphoton resonance. Constraints on the parameter
space can be obtained by interpreting some of the small diphoton excesses
reported by the LHC as the composite scalar or pseudoscalar of the model.
Another important test of the model is the presence of a nearby
hypercolor-singlet but color-octet state like the eta^8_Q or eta^8_{tilde Q},
which can also be constrained by dijet or monojet+monophoton data. Both
possibilities of a large or small width of the resonance can be accommodated,
depending on whether the hyper-glueball states are kinematically allowed in the
final state or not.

of this constraint is analyzed within mean field theory (MFT) based on a
Ginzburg-Landau free energy functional as well as via Monte Carlo simulations
of the 3D Ising model with fixed total magnetization. Within MFT and for finite
adsorption strengths at the walls, the thermodynamic properties of the film in
the canonical ensemble can be mapped exactly onto a grand canonical ensemble in
which the corresponding chemical potential plays the role of the Lagrange
multiplier associated with the constraint. However, due to a non-integrable
divergence of the mean field order parameter profile near a wall, the limit of
infinitely strong adsorption turns out to be not well-defined within MFT,
because it would necessarily violate the constraint. The critical Casimir force
(CCF) acting on the two planar walls of the film is generally found to behave
differently in the canonical and grand canonical ensembles. For instance, the
canonical CCF in the presence of equal preferential adsorption at the two walls
is found to have the opposite sign and a slower decay behavior as a function of
the film thickness compared to its grand canonical counterpart. We derive the
stress tensor in the canonical ensemble and find that it has the same
expression as in the grand canonical case, but with the chemical potential
playing the role of the Lagrange multiplier associated with the constraint. The
different behavior of the CCF in the two ensembles is rationalized within MFT
by showing that, for a prescribed value of the thermodynamic control parameter
of the film, i.e., density or chemical potential, the film pressures are
identical in the two ensembles, while the corresponding bulk pressures are not.

system to weak external forcings and vice versa. Even for simple models of the
general circulation, such as the dry dynamical core, the LRF cannot be
calculated from first principles due to the lack of a complete theory for
eddy-mean flow feedbacks. According to the Fluctuation-Dissipation Theorem
(FDT), the LRF can be calculated using only the covariance and lag-covariance
matrices of the unforced system. However, efforts in calculating the LRFs for
GCMs using FDT have produced mixed results, and the reason(s) behind the poor
performance of the FDT remains unclear. In Part 1 of this study, the LRF of an
idealized GCM, the dry dynamical core with Held-Suarez physics, is accurately
calculated using Green's functions. In this paper (Part 2), the LRF of the same
model is computed using FDT, which is found to perform poorly for some of the
test cases. The accurate LRF of Part 1 is used with a linear stochastic
equation to show that dimension-reduction by projecting the data onto leading
EOFs, which is commonly used for FDT, can alone be a significant source of
error. Simplified equations and examples of 2 x 2 matrices are then used to
demonstrate that this error arises because of the non-normality of the
operator. These results suggest that errors caused by dimension-reduction are a
major, if not the main, contributor to the poor performance of the LRF
calculated using FDT, and that further investigations of dimension-reduction
strategies with a focus on non-normality are needed.

standard models with microscopic diffusion and one grid with rotation-induced
mixing, at metallicity [Fe/H] = 0.13, 0.0, and 0.01 dex, respectively, using
the Toulouse-Geneva evolution code. We compare observations with models in a
color-magnitude diagram for each cluster to infer a cluster age and a stellar
mass for each cluster member. Then, for each cluster we analyze the lithium
abundance of each star as a function of mass. The data for the open clusters
Hyades, NGC 752, and M67, are compatible with lithium abundance being a
function of both age and mass for stars in these clusters. Our models with
meridional circulation qualitatively reproduce the general trend of lithium
abundance evolution as a function of stellar mass in all three clusters. This
study points out the importance of mass dependence in the evolution of lithium
abundance as a function of age. Comparison between models with and without
rotation-induced mixing shows that the inclusion of meridional circulation is
essential to account for lithium depletion in low-mass stars. However, our
results suggest that other mechanisms should be included to explain the Li-dip

the non-parametric rule ensembles. This approach gives us a flexible class of

straightforward to incorporate regularization into the sample moment

In such arrays at each antenna location there are three orthogonal dipoles,
allowing full measurement of both the horizontal and vertical components of the
received waveform. We formulate this problem from the viewpoint of Compressive
Sensing (CS). However, unlike for isotropic array elements (single antenna), we
now have three complex valued weight coefficients associated with each
potential location (due to the three dipoles), which have to be simultaneously
minimised. If this is not done, we may only set the weight coefficients of
individual dipoles to be zero valued, rather than complete tripoles, meaning
some dipoles may remain at each location. Therefore, the contributions of this
paper are to formulate the design of sparse tripole arrays as an optimisation
problem, and then we obtain a solution based on the minimisation of a modified
l1 norm or a series of iteratively solved reweighted minimisations, which
ensure a truly sparse solution. Design examples are provided to verify the
effectiveness of the proposed methods and show that a good approximation of a

problem in comparative genomics. Most existing methods compare conserved
features in extant genomes in the phylogeny to define potential ancestral gene
adjacencies, and either try to reconstruct all ancestral genomes under a global
evolutionary parsimony criterion, or, focusing on a single ancestral genome,
use a scaffolding approach to select a subset of ancestral gene adjacencies,
generally aiming at reducing the fragmentation of the reconstructed ancestral
genome. In this paper, we describe an exact algorithm for the Small Parsimony
Problem that combines both approaches. We consider that gene adjacencies at
internal nodes of the species phylogeny are weighted, and we introduce an
objective function defined as a convex combination of these weights and the
evolutionary cost under the Single-Cut-or-Join (SCJ) model. The weights of
ancestral gene adjacencies can e.g. be obtained through the recent availability
of ancient DNA sequencing data, which provide a direct hint at the genome
structure of the considered ancestor, or through probabilistic analysis of gene
adjacencies evolution. We show the NP-hardness of our problem variant and
propose a Fixed-Parameter Tractable algorithm based on the Sankoff-Rousseau
dynamic programming algorithm that also allows to sample co-optimal solutions.
We apply our approach to mammalian and bacterial data providing different
degrees of complexity. We show that including adjacency weights in the
objective has a significant impact in reducing the fragmentation of the
reconstructed ancestral gene orders.

coupled by time-periodic hopping. We show that with proper driving, the coupled
Kitaev chains can turn into a fully gapped superconductor which is analogous to
the $p_x+ip_y$ state but has two, rather than one, chiral edge modes. A
different driving protocol turns it into a gapless superconductor with isolated

$\pi/T$, with $T$ the driving period. The time evolution operator

tightly-knit, enduring structures that tend to channel local migration between

bridging communities have hub-and-spoke structures that tend to emerge
dynamically from globe-spanning movements. We find that world migration is

in the Hamiltonian formulation of the theory, the existence of a primary
constraint, which generates a secondary constraint, thus eliminating the
Ostrogradsky ghost. For $n>1$, we show that, in addition to the degeneracy of
the kinetic matrix, one needs to impose extra conditions to ensure the presence
of a sufficient number of secondary constraints that can eliminate all the
Ostrogradsky ghosts. When these conditions that ensure the disappearance of the
Ostrogradsky instability are satisfied, we show that the Euler-Lagrange

second order system.
