formation and evolution depends on the underlying cosmology and on the
statistical nature of the primordial density fluctuations. In this work we
investigate the impact of primordial non-gaussianities (PNG) on the scaling
properties of galaxy clusters. We performed a series of cosmological
hydrodynamic N-body simulations featuring adiabatic gas physics and different
levels of non-Gaussian initial conditions within the $\Lambda$CDM framework. We
focus on the T-M, S-M, Y-M and Yx-M scalings relating the total cluster mass
with temperature, entropy and SZ cluster integrated pressure that reflect the
thermodynamical state of the intra-cluster medium. Our results show that PNG
have an impact on cluster scalings laws. The mass power-law indexes of the
scalings are almost unaffected by the existence of PNG but the amplitude and
redshift evolution of their normalizations are clearly affected. The effect is
stronger for the evolution of the Y-M and Yx-M normalizations, which change by
as much as 22% and 16% when $f_{NL}$ varies from -500 to 500, respectively.
These results are consistent with the view that positive/negative $f_{NL}$
affect cluster profiles due to an increase/decrease of cluster concentrations.
At low values of $f_{NL}$, as suggested by present Planck constraints on a
scale invariant $f_{NL}$, the impact on the scalings normalizations is only a
few percent, which is small when compared with the effect of additional gas
physics and other cosmological effects such as dark energy. However if $f_{NL}$
is in fact a scale dependent parameter, PNG may have larger positive/negative
amplitudes at clusters scales and therefore our results suggest that PNG should
be taken into account when galaxy cluster data is used to infer cosmological
parameters or to asses the constraining power of future cluster surveys.

tune-out spectroscopy, which is the measurement of light wavelengths where the
electric polarizability of an atom has a zero. Using atom interferometry
methods, tune-out wavelengths can be measured very accurately. Their values
depend on the ratios of various dipole matrix elements and are thus useful for
constraining theory and broadening the application of experimental values.
Tune-out wavelength measurements to date have focused on zeros of the scalar
polarizability, but in general the vector polarizability also contributes. We
show here that combined measurements of the vector and scalar polarizabilities
can provide more detailed information about the matrix element ratios, and in
particular can distinguish small contributions from the atomic core and the
valence tail states. These small contributions are the leading error sources in
current parity violation calculations for cesium.

(deformation) quantization of Lie algebras as well as underlying module
algebras (=quantum spaces). Smash product construction combines these two into
the new algebra which, in fact, does not depend on the twist. However, we can
turn it into bialgebroid in the twist dependent way. Alternatively, one can use
Drinfeld twist techniques in a category of bialgebroids. We show that both
techniques indicated in the title: twisting of a bialgebroid or constructing a
bialgebroid from the twisted bialgebra give rise to the same result in the case
of normalized cocycle twist. This can be useful for better description of a

application of quantum technology for predictive simulation. However, there
remain questions regarding the degree of confidence that can be placed in the
results of AQS since they do not naturally incorporate error correction.
Specifically, how do we know whether an analog simulation of a quantum model
will produce predictions that agree with the ideal model in the presence of
inevitable imperfections? At the same time, there is a widely held expectation
that certain quantum simulation questions will be robust to errors and
perturbations in the underlying hardware. Resolving these two points of view is
a critical step in making the most of this promising technology. In this work
we formalize the notion of AQS reliability by determining sensitivity of AQS
outputs to underlying parameters, and formulate conditions for robust
simulation. Our approach naturally reveals the importance of model symmetries
in dictating the robust properties. To demonstrate the approach, we
characterize the robust features of a variety of quantum many-body models.

deposited by a fast moving parton in a quark gluon plasma. This energy-momentum
is in turn used to compute the probability density for the production of soft

render manifest a relation between the average transverse momentum given to the
fast moving parton from the medium $\hat{q}$, the entropy density to shear
viscosity ratio $\eta/s$ and the energy lost by the fast moving parton $\Delta
E$ in an expanding medium under similar conditions to those generated in
nucleus-nucleus collisions at the LHC. We find that $\hat{q}$ increases
linearly with $\Delta E$ for both trigger and away side partons that have been
produced throughout the medium. On the other hand, $\eta/s$ is more stable with
$\Delta E$. We also study how these transport coefficients vary with the
geometrical location of the hard scattering that produces the fast moving
partons. The behavior of $\hat{q}$, with $\Delta E$ is understood as arising
from the length of medium the parton traverses from the point where it is
produced. However, since $\eta/s$ is proportional to the ratio of the length of
medium traversed by the fast parton and the average number of scatterings it
experiences, it has a milder dependence on the energy it loses. This study
represents a tool to obtain a direct connection between transport coefficients
and the description of in-medium energy loss within a linear viscous
hydrodynamical evolution of the bulk.

growth of local operators in time, which can be quantified with the ""butterfly""

independent ballistic upper bound on the size of time evolved operators in
non-relativistic lattice models. Here, we argue that $v_B$ is a state-dependent
effective Lieb-Robinson velocity. We study the butterfly velocity in a wide
variety of quantum field theories using holography and compare with free
particle computations to understand the role of strong coupling. We find that,
depending on the way length and time scale, $v_B$ acquires a temperature
dependence and decreases towards the IR. We also comment on experimental

recommendations derived from the ASCR/HEP Exascale Requirements Review meeting
held in June, 2015. The main conclusions are as follows. 1) Larger, more
capable computing and data facilities are needed to support HEP science goals
in all three frontiers: Energy, Intensity, and Cosmic. The expected scale of
the demand at the 2025 timescale is at least two orders of magnitude -- and in
some cases greater -- than that available currently. 2) The growth rate of data
produced by simulations is overwhelming the current ability, of both facilities
and researchers, to store and analyze it. Additional resources and new
techniques for data analysis are urgently needed. 3) Data rates and volumes
from HEP experimental facilities are also straining the ability to store and
analyze large and complex data volumes. Appropriately configured
leadership-class facilities can play a transformational role in enabling
scientific discovery from these datasets. 4) A close integration of HPC
simulation and data analysis will aid greatly in interpreting results from HEP
experiments. Such an integration will minimize data movement and facilitate
interdependent workflows. 5) Long-range planning between HEP and ASCR will be
required to meet HEP's research needs. To best use ASCR HPC resources the
experimental HEP program needs a) an established long-term plan for access to
ASCR computational and data resources, b) an ability to map workflows onto HPC
resources, c) the ability for ASCR facilities to accommodate workflows run by
collaborations that can have thousands of individual members, d) to transition
codes to the next-generation HPC platforms that will be available at ASCR
facilities, e) to build up and train a workforce capable of developing and
using simulations and analysis to support HEP scientific research on

astrophysical neutrinos including $\sim 50$ high-energy starting events, but no
individual sources have been identified. It is therefore important to develop
the most sensitive and efficient possible algorithms to identify point sources
of these neutrinos. The most popular current method works by exploring a dense
grid of possible directions to individual sources, and identifying the single
direction with the maximum probability of having produced multiple detected
neutrinos. This method has numerous strengths, but it is computationally
intensive and, because it focuses on the single best location for a point
source, additional point sources are not included in the evidence. We propose a
new maximum likelihood method that uses the angular separations between all
pairs of neutrinos in the data. Unlike existing autocorrelation methods for
this type of analysis, which also use angular separations between neutrino
pairs, our method incorporates information about the point spread function and
can identify individual point sources. We find that if the angular resolution
is a few degrees or better, then this approach reduces both false positive and
false negative errors compared to the current method, and is also more
computationally efficient up to, potentially, hundreds of thousands of detected
neutrinos.

luminosities of low-mass TWA stars and the longevities of their circumstellar
disks suggests that primordial disks orbiting early-type M stars in the TWA
have dispersed rapidly as a consequence of their persistent large X-ray fluxes.
Conversely, the disks orbiting the very lowest-mass pre-MS stars and pre-MS
brown dwarfs in the Association may have survived because their X-ray
luminosities and, hence, disk photoevaporation rates are very low to begin
with, and then further decline relatively early in their pre-MS evolution.

we report the observation of an unusual ""butterfly"" shaped titanic angular
magnetoresistance (AMR) in the non-magnetic, Dirac material, ZrSiS. The MR is
large and positive, reaching nearly 1.8 x 10^5 percent at 9 T and 2 K at an
angle of 45o between the applied current (along the a-axis) and the applied
field (90o is H parallel to the c-axis). Approaching 90o, a ""dip"" is seen in

combination of 2D and 3D Dirac pockets comprising its Fermi surface and that
the anomalous transport behavior coincides with a topological phase transition
whose robust signature is evident despite transport contributions from other
parts of the Fermi surface. We also find that as a function of angle, the
temperature dependent resistivity in high field displays a broad peak-like
behavior, unlike any known Dirac/Weyl material. The combination of very high

property changes to occur as a function of angle between applied fields makes
it a promising platform to study the physics stemming from the coexistence of

stage of the most proximity graph techniques. Hierarchical NSW incrementally
builds a multi-layer structure consisting from hierarchical set of proximity
graphs (layers) for nested subsets of the stored elements. The maximum layer in
which an element is present is selected randomly with an exponentially decaying
probability distribution. This allows producing graphs similar to the
previously studied Navigable Small World (NSW) structures while additionally
having the links separated by their characteristic distance scales. Starting
search from the upper layer together with utilizing the scale separation boosts
the performance compared to NSW and allows a logarithmic complexity scaling.
Additional employment of a heuristic for selecting proximity graph neighbors
significantly increases performance at high recall and in case of highly
clustered data. Performance evaluation has demonstrated that the proposed
general metric space search index is able to strongly outperform previous
opensource state-of-the-art vector-only approaches. Similarity of the algorithm

on the statistical surrogate. The validity of the surrogacy condition is often
controversial. Here we exploit that fact that in modern datasets, researchers
often observe a large number, possibly hundreds or thousands, of intermediate
outcomes, thought to lie on or close to the causal chain between the treatment
and the long-term outcome of interest. Even if none of the individual proxies
satisfies the statistical surrogacy criterion by itself, using multiple proxies
can be useful in causal inference. We focus primarily on a setting with two
samples, an experimental sample containing data about the treatment indicator
and the surrogates and an observational sample containing information about the
surrogates and the primary outcome. We state assumptions under which the
average treatment effect be identified and estimated with a high-dimensional
vector of proxies that collectively satisfy the surrogacy assumption, and
derive the bias from violations of the surrogacy assumption, and show that even
if the primary outcome is also observed in the experimental sample, there is
still information to be gained from using surrogates.

thermal energy transport in nanoscale are of great interest in both theoretical
and practical applications. In the present study, we investigated the nanoscale
vaporization and condensation by using molecular dynamics simulation. A cuboid
system is modeled by placing hot and cold walls in the bottom and top ends and
filling with working fluid between the two walls. By setting two different high
temperatures for the hot wall, we showed the normal and explosive vaporizations
and their impacts on thermal transport. For the cold wall, the cuboid
nanostructures with fixed height, varied length, width ranging from 4 to 20
layers, and an interval of 4 layers are constructed to study the effects of
condensation induced by different nanostructures. For vaporization, the results
showed that higher temperature of the hot wall led to faster transport of the
working fluid as a cluster moving from the hot wall to the cold wall. However,
excessive temperature of the hot wall causes explosive boiling, which seems not
good for the transport of heat due to the less phase change of working fluid.
For condensation, the results indicate that nanostructure facilitates
condensation, which could be affected not only by the increased surface area
but also by the distances between surfaces of the nanostructures and the cold
end. There is an optimal nanosctructure scheme which maximizes the phase change
rate of the entire system.

for the same instantaneous sharing of the injection of energy provided by the
rotational power, the field and the particles are affected differently by
radiation and losses. We present the model, and study in detail how the
spectrum of a canonical isolated PWN is affected during compression and
re-expansion and how this may impact on the CTA 1 case. By exploring the

theoretic understanding. In this paper, we demonstrate that one particular
groomer called soft drop actually makes precision jet substructure easier. In
particular, we derive a factorization formula for a large class of soft drop
jet substructure observables, including jet mass. The essential observation
that allows for this factorization is that, without the soft wide-angle
radiation groomed by soft drop, all singular contributions are collinear. The
simplicity and universality of the collinear limit in QCD allows us to show
that to all orders, the normalized differential cross section has no
contributions from non-global logarithms. It is also independent of process, up
to the relative fraction of quark and gluon jets. In fact, soft drop allows us
to define this fraction precisely. The factorization theorem also explains why
soft drop observables are less sensitive to hadronization than their ungroomed
counterparts. Using the factorization theorem, we resum the soft drop jet mass
to next-to-next-to-leading logarithmic accuracy. This requires calculating some
clustering effects that are closely related to corresponding effects found in
jet veto calculations. We match our resummed calculation to fixed order results
for both $e^+e^-\to$ dijets and $pp\to Z+j$ events, producing the first jet
substructure predictions (groomed or ungroomed) to this accuracy for the LHC.

into account the obscuration by dust. To do so, one of the most popular methods
consists in combining the UV with the emission from the dust itself in the IR.
Yet, different studies have derived different estimators, showing that no such
hybrid estimator is truly universal. In this paper we aim at understanding and
quantifying what physical processes drive the variations between different
hybrid estimators. Doing so, we aim at deriving new universal UV+IR hybrid
estimators to correct the UV for dust attenuation, taking into account the
intrinsic physical properties of galaxies. We use the CIGALE code to model the
spatially-resolved FUV to FIR SED of eight nearby star-forming galaxies drawn
from the KINGFISH sample. This allows us to determine their local physical
properties, and in particular their UV attenuation, average SFR, average
specific SFR (sSFR), and their stellar mass. We then examine how hybrid
estimators depend on said properties. We find that hybrid UV+IR estimators
strongly depend on the stellar mass surface density (in particular at 70 and
100 micron) and on the sSFR (in particular at 24 micron and the TIR).
Consequently, the IR scaling coefficients for UV obscuration can vary by almost
an order of magnitude. This result contrasts with other groups who found
relatively constant coefficients with small deviations. We exploit these
variations to construct a new class of hybrid estimators based on observed UV
to near-IR colours and near-IR luminosity densities per unit area. We find that
they can reliably be extended to entire galaxies. The new estimators provide
better estimates of attenuation-corrected UV emission than classical hybrid
estimators. Naturally taking into account the variable impact of dust heated by
old stellar populations, they constitute a step towards universal estimators.

luminous Galactic molecular high-mass star-forming clumps ($\sim$1 pc scales),
and posited that there exists a characteristic ratio $L_{\rm{IR}}$

galaxies could then be explained as a summation of large numbers of high-mass

cannot be satisfactorily explained by the blending of large numbers of
high-mass clumps in the telescope beam. Not only do the clumps have a large
scatter in the $L_{\rm{IR}}$/$L_{\rm{HCN}}$ ratio, but also far too many
high-mass clumps are required to account for the Galactic IR and HCN
luminosities. We suggest that the scatter in the $L_{\rm{IR}}$/$L_{\rm{HCN}}$
ratio converges to the scatter of the Gao-Solomon relation at some size-scale
$\gtrsim$1 kpc. We suggest that the Gao-Solomon relation could instead result
from of a universal large-scale star formation efficiency, initial mass

various interaction stages. This enables us to do a comparative study of the
diffuse gas in dwarf-dwarf interactions and disentangle the gas lost due to
interactions with halos of massive galaxies, from the gas lost due to mutual
interaction between the dwarfs. We find that the neutral gas is extended in the
interacting pairs when compared to non-paired analogs, indicating that gas is
tidally pre-processed. Additionally, we find that the environment can shape the
HI distributions in the form of trailing tails and that the gas is not unbound
and lost to the surroundings unless the dwarf pair is residing near a massive
galaxy. We conclude that a nearby, massive host galaxy is what ultimately
prevents the gas from being reaccreted. Dwarf-dwarf interactions thus represent
an important part of the baryon cycle of low mass galaxies, enabling the

events among planets in WD systems easily triggers moon ejection. Repeated
close encounters within tenths of a planetary Hill radii are highly destructive
to even the most massive, close-in moons. Consequently, scattering increases
both the frequency of perturbing agents in WD systems, as well as the available
mass of polluting material in those systems, thereby enhancing opportunities
for collision and fragmentation and providing more dynamical pathways for
smaller bodies to reach the WD. Moreover, during intense scattering, planets
themselves have pericenters with respect to the WD of only a fraction of an AU,
causing extreme Hill-sphere contraction, and the liberation of moons into
WD-grazing orbits. Many of our results are directly applicable to exomoons

with the old stellar population. We present GALEX and WISE elliptical aperture
photometry of $\sim310$ early-type galaxies with Spitzer mid-infrared
spectroscopy and/or ancillary data from ATLAS3D, to characterize their
circumstellar dust and the shape of the radiation field that illuminates the
interstellar PAHs. We find that circumstellar dust is ubiquitous in early-type
galaxies, which indicates some tension between stellar population age estimates
and models for circumstellar dust production in very old stellar populations.
We also use dynamical masses from ATLAS3D to show that WISE W1 (3.4 $\mu$m)
mass-to-light ratios are consistent with the initial mass function variation
found by previous work. While the stellar population differences in early-type

$F_{\lambda}\propto\lambda^{-\gamma}$, we find a median $\gamma=1.30$ (with a
dispersion of $0.38$, no dependence on the redshift and a mild intrinsic
luminosity dependence) and a mean f$_{esc}=0.75$ (independent of the QSO

zero and a long tail of higher values, with a resulting dispersion of $0.7$. If

The impact of this supersonic motion on the formation of cosmological

the linear theory of small-scale fluctuations coupled to large-scale, relative
velocities in mean-density regions. In their formalism, they limited the
large-scale density environment to be those of the global mean density. We
improve on their formulation by allowing variation in the density environment
as well as the relative velocities. This leads to a new type of coupling
between large-scale and small-scale modes. We find that the small-scale
fluctuation grows in a biased way: faster in the overdense environment and
slower in the underdense environment. We also find that the net effect on the
global power spectrum of the density fluctuation is to boost its overall
amplitude from the prediction by Tseliakhovich & Hirata (2010).
Correspondingly, the conditional mass function of cosmological halos and the
halo bias parameter are both affected in a similar way. The discrepancy between
our prediction and that by Tseliakhovich & Hirata (2010) is significant, and
therefore the related cosmology and high-redshift astrophysics should be
revisited. The mathematical formalism of this study can be used for generating
cosmological initial conditions of small-scale perturbations in generic,
overdense (underdense) background patches.

the system has structural inhomogeneities. These structural inhomogeneities
arise also in expanding systems, where the fragment distribution is highly
dependent on the thermodynamic conditions (temperature, proton fraction, ...)
and the expansion velocity.
  Purpose: We aim to find the different regimes of fragment distribution, and
the existence of infinite clusters.
  Method: We study the dynamics of the nucleons with a semiclassical molecular
dynamics model. Starting with an equilibrium configuration, we expand the
system homogeneously until we arrive to an asymptotic configuration (i. e. very
low final densities). We study the fragment distribution throughout this
expansion.
  Results: We found the typical regimes of the asymptotic fragment distribution
of an expansion: u-shaped, power law and exponential. Another key feature in
our calculations is that, since the interaction between protons is long range
repulsive, we do not have always an infinite fragment. We found that, as
expected, the faster the expansion velocity is, the quicker the infinite
fragment disappears.
  Conclusions: We have developed a novel graph-based tool for the
identification of infinite fragments, and found a transition from U-shaped to
exponential fragment mass distribution with increasing expansion rate.

plastic flow is central to making predictions about the bulk material
properties and response of disordered materials. To address this issue, we
perform experiments on flow-stabilized solids composed of micron-scale spheres
within a microfluidic channel, in a regime where particle inertia is
negligible. Each solid heap exists within a stress gradient imposed by the
flow, and we track the positions of particles in response to single impulses of
fluid-driven compression or decompression. We find that the resulting
deformation field is well-decomposed into an affine field, with a constant
strain profile throughout the solid, and a non-affine field. The magnitude of
this non-affine response decays with the distance from the free surface in the
long-time limit, suggesting that the distance from jamming plays a significant
role in controlling the length scale of plastic flow. Finally, we observe that
compressive pulses create more rearrangements than decompressive pulses, an
effect that we quantify using the $D^2_\mathrm{min}$ statistic for non-affine
motion. Unexpectedly, the time scale for the compression response is shorter
than for decompression at the same strain (but unequal pressure), providing
insight into the coupling between deformation and cage-breaking.

that any of the systems besides V1500 Cyg had nova eruptions, but because not
all post-nova systems have detectable shells, we also cannot exclude the
possibility of a nova eruption occurring in any of these systems and knocking

free-standing binary shaped pupil mask coronagraphs, which are applicable for
telescopes with partially obscured pupils. Three masks, designed to be
complementary (labeled Mask-A, Mask-B, and Mask-C), were formed in 5 micron
thick nickel. The design of Mask-A is based on a one-dimensional barcode mask.
The design principle of Mask-B is similar, but has a smaller inner working
angle and a lower contrast than Mask-A. Mask-C is based on a concentric ring
mask and provides the widest dark region and a symmetric point spread function.
Mask-A and Mask-C were both designed to produce a flexibly tailored dark region
(i.e., non-uniform contrast). The contrast was evaluated using a light source
comprising a broadband super-luminescent light-emitting diode with a center
wavelength of 650 nm, and the measurements were carried out in a large vacuum
chamber. Active wavefront control was not applied in this work. The
coronagraphic images obtained by experiment were mostly consistent with the
designs. The contrast of Mask-A within the ranges 3.3 - 8 lambda/D and 8 - 12
lambda/D was ~10^{-4} - 10^{-7} and ~10^{-7}, respectively, where lambda is the
wavelength and D is the pupil diameter. The contrast close to the center of
Mask-B was ~10^{-4} and that of Mask-C over an extended field of view (5 - 25
lambda/D) was ~10^{-5} - 10^{-6}. The effect of tilting the masks was
investigated, and found to be irrelevant at the ~10^{-7} contrast level.
Therefore the masks can be tilted to avoid ghosting. These high-contrast
free-standing masks have the potential to enable coronagraphic imaging over a
wide wavelength range using both ground-based and space-borne general-purpose
telescopes with pupil structures not specifically designed for coronagraphy.

of t-structures. Like t-structures, they permit to divide an object in a

crucial differences. For instance, a bounded t-structure gives rise to an
abelian subcategory of T, while a bounded co-t-structure gives rise to a

  This brief survey will emphasise three philosophical points. First, bounded
t-structures are akin to the canonical example of ""soft"" truncation of
complexes in the derived category. Secondly, bounded co-t-structures are akin
to the canonical example of ""hard"" truncation of complexes in the homotopy
category.
  Thirdly, a triangulated category T may be skewed towards t-structures or
co-t-structures, in the sense that one type of structure is more useful than
the other for studying T. In particular, we think of derived categories as
skewed towards t-structures, and of homotopy categories as skewed towards
co-t-structures.

another. For a restricted but interesting class of coupled probability measures
we prove an explicit formula for the mutual dimensions $mdim(R_1:R_2)$ and
$Mdim(R_1:R_2)$, and we show that the condition $Mdim(R_1:R_2) = 0$ is
necessary but not sufficient for $R_1$ and $R_2$ to be independently random.
  We also identify conditions under which Billingsley generalizations of the
mutual dimensions $mdim(S:T)$ and $Mdim(S:T)$ can be meaningfully defined; we
show that under these conditions these generalized mutual dimensions have the
""correct"" relationships with the Billingsley generalizations of $dim(S)$,
$Dim(S)$, $dim(T)$, and $Dim(T)$ that were developed and applied by Lutz and
Mayordomo; and we prove a divergence formula for the values of these
generalized mutual dimensions.

one of the solutions to such cases. Among different watermarking techniques,
the wavelet transform has been used more because of its good ability in
modeling the human visual system. Recently, Shearlet transform as an extension
of Wavelet transform which is based on multi-resolution and multi-directional

appropriate representation of image edges. In this paper a hybrid scheme using
Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) and Discrete Shearlet Transform (DST) is
presented. In this way, the host image is decomposed using DWT, and then its
low frequency sub-band is decomposed by DST. After that, the bidiagonal
singular value decomposition (BSVD) is applied on the selected sub-band from
Shearlet transform and the gray-scale watermark image is embedded into its
bidiagonal singular values. The proposed method is examined on the images with
different textures and resistance is evaluated against various attacks like

this pattern, we simulated the ecological and evolutionary dynamics of
influenza in a host metapopulation representing the temperate north, tropics,
and temperate south. Although seasonality and air traffic are frequently used
to explain global migratory patterns of influenza, we find that other factors
may have a comparable or greater impact. Notably, a region's basic reproductive
number ($R_0$) strongly affects the antigenic evolution of its viral population
and the probability that its strains will spread and fix globally: a 17-28%
higher $R_0$ in one region can explain the observed patterns. Seasonality, in
contrast, increases the probability that a tropical (less seasonal) population
will export evolutionarily successful strains but alone does not predict that
these strains will be antigenically advanced. The relative sizes of different
host populations, their birth and death rates, and the region in which H3N2
first appears affect influenza's phylogeography in different but relatively
minor ways. These results suggest general principles that dictate the spatial
dynamics of antigenically evolving pathogens and offer predictions for how

Suppose
(X,Y) denotes a risk vector pertaining to two components in some system. A
relevant measurement of risk contagion would be to quantify the amount of
influence of high values of Y on X. This can be measured in a variety of ways.
In this paper, we study two such measures: the quantity E[max(X-t,0)|Y > t]
called Marginal Mean Excess (MME) as well as the related quantity E[X|Y > t]
called Marginal Expected Shortfall (MES). Both quantities are indicators of
risk contagion and useful in various applications ranging from finance,
insurance and systemic risk to environmental and climate risk. We work under
the assumptions of multivariate regular variation, hidden regular variation and
asymptotic tail independence for the risk vector (X,Y). Many broad and useful
model classes satisfy these assumptions. We present several examples and derive
the asymptotic behavior of both MME and MES as the threshold t tends to
infinity. We observe that although we assume asymptotic tail independence in
the models, MME and MES converge to 1 under very general conditions; this
reflects that the underlying weak dependence in the model still remains
significant. Besides the consistency of the empirical estimators, we introduce
an extrapolation method based on extreme value theory to estimate both MME and
MES for high thresholds t where little data are available. We show that these
estimators are consistent and illustrate our methodology in both simulated and
real data sets.

geometry (spectra and dynamics) of fractal strings. Such geometric oscillations
can be seen most clearly in the explicit volume formula for the tubular
neighborhoods of a $p$-adic fractal string $\mathcal{L}_p$, expressed in terms
of the underlying complex dimensions. The general fractal tube formula obtained
in this paper is illustrated by several examples, including the nonarchimedean
Cantor and Euler strings. Moreover, we show that the Minkowski dimension of a
$p$-adic fractal string coincides with the abscissa of convergence of the
geometric zeta function associated with the string, as well as with the
asymptotic growth rate of the corresponding geometric counting function. The
proof of this new result can be applied to both real and $p$-adic fractal
strings and hence, yields a unifying explanation of a key result in the theory
of complex dimensions for fractal strings, even in the archimedean (or real)
case.

technique for rigorously solving Maxwell's equations. However,
three-dimensional optical nonlinearity in current commercial and research FDTD
softwares requires solving iteratively an implicit form of Maxwell's equations
over the entire numerical space and at each time step. Reaching numerical
convergence demands significant computational resources and practical
implementation often requires major modifications to the core FDTD engine. In
this paper, we present an explicit method to include second and third order
optical nonlinearity in the FDTD framework based on a nonlinear generalization
of the Lorentz dispersion model. A formal derivation of the nonlinear Lorentz
dispersion equation is equally provided, starting from the quantum mechanical
equations describing nonlinear optics in the two-level approximation. With the
proposed approach, numerical integration of optical nonlinearity and dispersion
in FDTD is intuitive, transparent, and fully explicit. A strong-field
formulation is also proposed, which opens an interesting avenue for FDTD-based
modelling of the extreme nonlinear optics phenomena involved in laser
filamentation and femtosecond micromachining of dielectrics.

parasite may inhabit only a single host. The case where a parasite may infect
many hosts, widespread parasitism, has until recently gained little traction.
This is due in part to the computational complexity involved in reconstructing
the coevolutionary histories where parasites may infect only a single host,
which is NP-Hard. Allowing parasites to inhabit more than one host has been
seen to only further compound this computationally intractable problem.
Recently however, well-established algorithms for estimating the problem
instance where a parasite may infect only a single host have been extended to
handle widespread parasites. Although this has offered significant progress, it
has been noted that these algorithms poorly handle parasites that inhabit
phylogenetically distant hosts.
  In this work we extend these previous algorithms to handle cases where
parasites inhabit phylogenetically distant hosts using an additional
evolutionary event which we call spread. Our new framework is shown to infer
significantly more congruent coevolutionary histories compared to existing
methods over both synthetic and biological data sets. We then apply the newly
proposed algorithm, which we call WiSPA (WideSpread Parasitism Analyser), to
the well studied coevolutionary system of Primates and Enterobius (pinworms),
where existing methods have been unable to reconcile the widespread parasitism
present without permitting additional divergence events. Using WiSPA and the
new biological event, spread, we provide the first statistically significant
coevolutionary hypothesis for this system.

statistics. Following this, we show by explicit example that there are cases of
states that rule out s-LHV models by violating our inequality, but which
nonetheless have a multivariate LHV model. Even so, we show how merely ruling
out s-LHV models is still sufficient to allow for fully device independent
quantum key distribution (QKD) and entanglement witnessing. This being the
case, our inequality illustrates two things. First, it makes fully
device-independent QKD on continuous variables substantially more
straightforward. Second, it shows how the degree of correlation needed to
demonstrate device-independent QKD is distinct from both Bell-nonlocality and
EPR-steering. Although nonlocality in general requires ruling out all LHV
models, s-LHV models are sufficiently useful to warrant further exploration.

defined as the special solutions that contract homothetically under the flow.
Colding-Ilmanen-Minicozzi showed that cylindrical self-shrinkers are rigid in a
strong sense - that is, any self-shrinker that is mean convex with uniformly
bounded curvature on a large, but compact, set must be a round cylinder. Using
this result, Colding and Minicozzi were able to establish uniqueness of blowups
at cylindrical singularities, and provide a detailed description of the
singular set of generic mean curvature flows.
  In this paper, we show that the bounded curvature assumption is unnecessary
for the rigidity of the cylinder if either n is at most 6, or if the mean
curvature is bounded below by a positive constant. These results follow from
curvature estimates that we prove for strictly mean convex self-shrinkers. We
also obtain a rigidity theorem in all dimensions for graphical self-shrinkers,

suggests that although it may be hard to predict an item's popularity when it

social network makes the problem easier. We test the robustness of such claims
by using data from social networks spanning music, books, photos, and URLs. We
find a stronger result: not only do predictive models with peeking achieve high
accuracy on all datasets, they also generalize well, so much so that models
trained on any one dataset perform with comparable accuracy on items from other

  Though practically useful, our models (and those in other work) are
intellectually unsatisfying because common formulations of the problem, which
involve peeking at the first small-k adopters and predicting whether items end
up in the top half of popular items, are both too sensitive to the speed of
early adoption and too easy. Most of the predictive power comes from looking at
how quickly items reach their first few adopters, while for other features of
early adopters and their networks, even the direction of correlation with
popularity is not consistent across domains. Problem formulations that examine
items that reach k adopters in about the same amount of time reduce the

existence of strong wind. Those works focus only on the region close to black
hole thus it is unknown whether or where the wind production stops at large
radii. To address this question, Bu et al. (2016) have performed hydrodynamic
(HD) simulations by taking into account the gravitational potential of both the
black hole and the nuclear star clusters. The latter is assumed to be $\propto
\sigma^2 \ln(r)$, with $\sigma$ being the velocity dispersion of stars and $r$
be the distance from the center of the galaxy. It was found that when the
gravity is dominated by nuclear stars, i.e., outside of radius $R_A\equiv
GM_{\rm BH}/\sigma^2$, winds can no longer be produced. That work, however,
neglects the magnetic field, which is believed to play a crucial dynamical role
in the accretion and thus must be taken into account. In this paper, we revisit
this problem by performing magneto-hydrodynamical (MHD) simulations. We confirm
the result of Bu et al. (2016), namely wind can't be produced at the region of
$R>R_A$. Our result, combined with the results of Yuan et al. (2015), indicates
that the formula describing the mass flux of wind $\dot{M}_{\rm
wind}=\dot{M}_{\rm BH}(r/20r_s)$ can only be applied to the region where the
black hole potential is dominant. Here $\dot{M}_{\rm BH}$ is the mass accretion
rate at the black hole horizon and the value of $R_A$ is similar to the Bondi
radius.

the slow decay of the dipole field and the dependence on the vacuum thickness,
however, studies based on first-principles calculations often failed to reach
such a conclusion. Taking graphene/hexagonal-BN and MoS2/WS2 lateral

in aqueous solutions, with or without added salt, employing simple physical
models. The equilibrium ionic profiles close to the membrane are governed by
the well-known Poisson-Boltzmann (PB) equation. We analyze the effect of
different boundary conditions, imposed by the membrane, on the ionic profiles
and the corresponding osmotic pressure. The discussion is separated into the
single membrane case and that of two interacting membranes. For one membrane
setup, we show the different solutions of the PB equation and discuss the
interplay between constant-charge and constant-potential boundary conditions. A
modification of the PB theory is presented to treat the extremely high
counter-ion concentration in the vicinity of a charge membrane. For two
equally-charged membranes, we analyze the different pressure regimes for the
constant-charge boundary condition, and discuss the difference in the osmotic
pressure for various boundary conditions. The non-equal charged membranes is
reviewed as well, and the crossover from repulsion to attraction is calculated
analytically. We then examine the charge-regulation boundary condition and
discuss its effects on the ionic profiles and the osmotic pressure for two
equally-charged membranes. In the last section, we briefly review the van der
Waals (vdW) interactions and their effect on the free energy between two planar
membranes. We explain the simple Hamaker pair-wise summation procedure, and
introduce the more rigorous Lifshitz theory. The latter is a key ingredient in
the DLVO theory, which combines repulsive electrostatic with attractive vdW
interactions, and offers a simple explanation for colloidal or membrane
stability. Finally, the chapter ends by a short account of the limitations of
the approximations inherent in the PB theory.

DPGs and extracted features to characterize them using a new peak
identification algorithm which tracks sloping tendencies around local maxima in

supervised machine learning to classify DPGs. We created four benchmark data
sets: one unbalanced and three balanced versions using three different

testing binary and multiclass versions of six machine learning algorithms on
each of the four benchmark versions. While each classifier had advantages and
disadvantages, all classifiers with imbalance treatments had higher recall

algorithm used. Based on the benchmarking results, we selected a subset of
classifiers to classify the full, unlabelled data set of over 1.5 million DPGs

the classifiers using a multiclass ensemble tree learner in combination with
two oversampling imbalance treatments were the most efficient; they identified

and study their performance under the asymptotic framework of the above
reference. The strategies depend only on the current state of the system and
keep the deviation from the target inside a time-varying domain. Although the
dynamics of the target is non-Markovian, it turns out that such strategies are
asympototically optimal for a large list of examples.

  Recommendation","11 pages, 5 figures",,,,"cs.IR cs.CV cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Identifying relationships between items is a key task of an online
recommender system, in order to help users discover items that are functionally
complementary or visually compatible. In domains like clothing recommendation,
this task is particularly challenging since a successful system should be
capable of handling a large corpus of items, a huge amount of relationships
among them, as well as the high-dimensional and semantically complicated
features involved. Furthermore, the human notion of ""compatibility"" to capture
goes beyond mere similarity: For two items to be compatible---whether jeans and
a t-shirt, or a laptop and a charger---they should be similar in some ways, but
systematically different in others.
  In this paper we propose a novel method, Monomer, to learn complicated and
heterogeneous relationships between items in product recommendation settings.
Recently, scalable methods have been developed that address this task by
learning similarity metrics on top of the content of the products involved.
Here our method relaxes the metricity assumption inherent in previous work and
models multiple localized notions of 'relatedness,' so as to uncover ways in
which related items should be systematically similar, and systematically
different. Quantitatively, we show that our system achieves state-of-the-art
performance on large-scale compatibility prediction tasks, especially in cases
where there is substantial heterogeneity between related items. Qualitatively,
we demonstrate that richer notions of compatibility can be learned that go
beyond similarity, and that our model can make effective recommendations of
heterogeneous content.

cosmological initial conditions at z=100. We follow the formation of a minihalo
and the subsequent collapse of its central gas to high densities, resolving
scales as small as ~ 1 AU. Using sink particles to represent the growing
protostars, we model the growth of the photodissociating and ionizing region
around the first sink, continuing the simulation for ~ 5000 yr after initial
protostar formation. Along with the first-forming sink, several tens of
secondary sinks form before an ionization front develops around the most
massive star. The resulting cluster has high rates of sink formation, ejections
from the stellar disc, and sink mergers during the first ~ 2000 yr, before the
onset of radiative feedback. By this time a warm ~ 5000 K phase of neutral gas
has expanded to roughly the disc radius of 2000 AU, slowing mass flow onto the
disc and sinks. By 5000 yr the most massive star grows to 20 M_sol, while the
total stellar mass approaches 75 M_sol. Out of the ~ 40 sinks, approximately 30
are low-mass (M_* < 1 M_sol), and if the simulation had resolved smaller scales
an even greater number of sinks might have formed. Thus, protostellar radiative
feedback is insufficient to prevent rapid disc fragmentation and the formation
of a high-member Pop III cluster before an ionization front emerges. Throughout
the simulation, the majority of stellar mass is contained within the most
massive stars, further implying that the Pop III initial mass function is
top-heavy.

bandwidth demand of video, audio and data transfer over the Internet.
Nonetheless, an increasing share of content delivery services adopt encryption
through HTTPS, which is not compatible with traditional ISP-managed approaches
like transparent and proxy caching. This raises the need for solutions
involving both Internet Service Providers (ISP) and Content Providers (CP): by
design, the solution should preserve business-critical CP information (e.g.,
content popularity, user preferences) on the one hand, while allowing for a
deeper integration of caches in the ISP architecture (e.g., in 5G femto-cells)
on the other hand.
  In this paper we address this issue by considering a content-oblivious
ISP-operated cache. The ISP allocates the cache storage to various content
providers so as to maximize the bandwidth savings provided by the cache: the
main novelty lies in the fact that, to protect business-critical information,
ISPs only need to measure the aggregated miss rates of the individual CPs and
do not need to be aware of the objects that are requested, as in classic
caching. We propose a cache allocation algorithm based on a perturbed
stochastic subgradient method, and prove that the algorithm converges close to
the allocation that maximizes the overall cache hit rate. We use extensive
simulations to validate the algorithm and to assess its convergence rate under
stationary and non-stationary content popularity. Our results (i) testify the
feasibility of content-oblivious caches and (ii) show that the proposed
algorithm can achieve within 10\% from the global optimum in our evaluation.

naturally achieved by elicitable risk measures. For the same objective, an
alternative approach has been introduced by Davis (2016) through the so-called

sensitive with respect to small changes in the available data set and exhibit
qualitative robustness. A new risk measure, the Lambda value at risk (Lambda
VaR), has been recently proposed by Frittelli et al. (2014), as a

fine optical spectroscopy, optical frequency standards, ultra-fast science

However, existing high bandwidth frequency control methods have small dynamic
range, requiring complex hybrid control techniques. To overcome this
limitation, we develop a new approach, where a home-made intra-cavity
electro-optic modulator tunes polarization state of laser signal rather than
only optical length of the cavity, to steer frequencies of a
nonlinear-polarization-rotation mode-locked laser. By taking advantage of
birefringence of the whole cavity, this approach results in not only broadband
but also relative large-dynamic frequency control. Experimental results show
that frequency control dynamic range increase at least one order in comparison
with the traditional intra-cavity electro-optic modulator technique. In
additional, this technique exhibits less side-effect than traditional frequency
control methods.

conflicting information and to draw conclusions in such situations. Hereby, the
knowledge is represented by so-called argumentation frameworks (AFs) and the
reasoning is done via semantics extracting acceptable sets. All reasonable
semantics are based on the notion of conflict-freeness which means that
arguments are only jointly acceptable when they are not linked within the AF.
In this paper, we study the question which information on top of conflict-free
sets is needed to compute extensions of a semantics at hand. We introduce a
hierarchy of so-called verification classes specifying the required amount of
information. We show that well-known standard semantics are exactly verifiable
through a certain such class. Our framework also gives a means to study
semantics lying inbetween known semantics, thus contributing to a more abstract

migration. We present N-body simulations of dynamical migration scenarios where
proto-hot Jupiters are excited to high eccentricities prior to tidal
circularisation and orbital decay. We show that in this scenario, the eccentric
giant planet typically destroys planets in the inner system, in agreement with
the observed lack of close super-Earth companions to hot Jupiters. (2) We
explore the role of the dynamics of outer systems in affecting the

consider specifically the effects of planet--planet scattering and Kozai

background counting rates due to neutrons and gamma-rays of up to about 300 kHz
per tube which will be exceeded for LHC luminosities larger than the design
value of 10-34 per square cm and second. Decreasing the drift-tube diameter to
15 mm while keeping the other parameters, including the gas gain, unchanged
reduces the maximum drift time from about 700 ns to 200 ns and the drift-tube
occupancy by a factor of 7. New drift-tube chambers for the endcap regions of
the ATLAS muon spectrometer have been designed. A prototype chamber consisting
of 12 times 8 layers of 15 mm diameter drift tubes of 1 m length has been
constructed with a sense wire positioning accuracy of 20 microns. The 15 mm
diameter drift-tubes have been tested with cosmic rays in the Gamma Irradiation
Facility at CERN at counting rates of up to 1.85 MHz.

them as Ising spin models which are implemented using physical qubits. The
solution of the optimization problem then corresponds to the ground state of
the system. Quantum tunnelling is harnessed to enable the system to move to the
ground state in a potentially highly non-convex energy landscape. A major
difficulty in encoding optimization problems in physical quantum annealing
devices is the fact that many real world optimization problems require
interactions of higher connectivity as well as multi-body terms beyond the
limitations of the physical hardware. In this work we address the question of
how to implement multi-body interactions using hardware which natively only
provides two-body interactions. The main result is an efficient circuit design
of such multi-body terms using superconducting flux qubits in which effective
N-body interactions are implemented using N ancilla qubits and only two
inductive couplers. It is then shown how this circuit can be used as the unit
cell of a scalable architecture by applying it to a recently proposed embedding
technique for constructing an architecture of logical qubits with arbitrary
connectivity using physical qubits which have nearest-neighbor four-body
interactions. It is further shown that this design is robust to non-linear
effects in the coupling loops as well as mismatches in some of the circuit
parameters.

reservoir of material that can ultimately provide energy through accretion, or
form stars in the presence of the black hole, as evidenced by the stellar
cluster that is presently located at the CND's centre. In this paper, we report
the results of a computational study of the dynamics of the CND. The results
lead us to question two paradigms that are prevalent in previous research on
the Galactic Centre. The first is that the disc's inner cavity is maintained by
the interaction of the central stellar cluster's strong winds with the disc's
inner rim, and second, that the presence of unstable clumps in the disc implies
that the CND is a transient feature. Our simulations show that, in the absence
of a magnetic field, the interaction of the wind with the inner disc rim
actually leads to a filling of the inner cavity within a few orbital
time-scales, contrary to previous expectations. However, including the effects
of magnetic fields stabilizes the inner disc rim against rapid inward
migration. Furthermore, this interaction causes instabilities that continuously
create clumps that are individually unstable against tidal shearing. Thus the
occurrence of such unstable clumps does not necessarily mean that the disc is
itself a transient phenomenon. The next steps in this investigation are to
explore the effect of the magnetorotational instability on the disc evolution
and to test whether the results presented here persist for longer time-scales
than those considered here.

revealed the presence of low-albedo asteroids in cometary like orbits (ACOs).
In contrast to Jupiter family comets (JFCs), ACOs are inactive, but possess
similar orbital parameters. Aims: In this work, we discuss why ACOs are
inactive, whereas JFCs show gas-driven dust activity, although both belong to
the same class of primitive solar system bodies. Methods: We hypothesize that
ACOs and JFCs have formed under the same physical conditions, namely by the
gravitational collapse of ensembles of ice and dust aggregates. We use the
memory effect of dust-aggregate layers under gravitational compression to
discuss under which conditions the gas-driven dust activity of these bodies is
possible. Results: Owing to their smaller sizes, JFCs can sustain gas-driven
dust activity much longer than the bigger ACOs, whose sub-surface regions
possess an increased tensile strength, due to gravitational compression of the
material. The increased tensile strength leads to the passivation against dust
activity after a relatively short time of activity. Conclusions: The
gravitational-collapse model of the formation of planetesimals, together with
the gravitational compression of the sub-surface material simultaneously,
explains the inactivity of ACOs and the gas-driven dust activity of JFCs. Their
initially larger sizes means that ACOs possess a higher tensile strength of
their sub-surface material, which leads to a faster termination of gas-driven
dust activity. Most objects with radii larger than $2 \, \mathrm{km}$ have
already lost their activity due to former gravitational compression of their
current surface material.

spectra were analysed using a differential model atmosphere method. Abundances
of carbon were derived using the C_2 Swan (0,1) band head at 5635.5 A. The

mean 12^C/13^C ratio is 11 +- 2, considering four red clump stars and 18 for
one star above the clump. The mean C/N ratios are 1.60 +- 0.30 and 1.74,
respectively. For the five stars in Melotte 66 we obtained: [C/Fe]=-0.21 +-
0.07 (s.d.), [N/Fe]=0.17 +- 0.07, [O/Fe]=0.16 +- 0.04. The 12^C/13^C and C/N

the ratios predicted by stellar evolution models. The mean values of 12^C/13^C

thermohaline-induced extra-mixing for the corresponding stellar turn-off masses
of about 1.1 - 1.2 Msun. The mean C/N ratios are not decreased as much as

for the vast majority of human beings. Mobile phones---the fastest growing
technology in the world that now reaches around 80\% of humanity---can enable
universal Internet access if it can resolve coverage problems that have
historically plagued previous cellular architectures (2G, 3G, and 4G). These
conventional architectures have not been able to sustain universal service
provisioning since these architectures depend on having enough users per cell
for their economic viability and thus are not well suited to rural areas (which
are by definition sparsely populated). The new generation of mobile cellular
technology (5G), currently in a formative phase and expected to be finalized
around 2020, is aimed at orders of magnitude performance enhancement. 5G offers
a clean slate to network designers and can be molded into an architecture also
amenable to universal Internet provisioning. Keeping in mind the great social
benefits of democratizing Internet and connectivity, we believe that the time
is ripe for emphasizing universal Internet provisioning as an important goal on
the 5G research agenda. In this paper, we investigate the opportunities and
challenges in utilizing 5G for global access to the Internet for all (GAIA). We
have also identified the major technical issues involved in a 5G-based GAIA
solution and have set up a future research agenda by defining open research
problems.

as a composite spin-2 state and the varying UV scale corresponds to a varying

computer vision tasks. It is common to introduce a priori information in the
estimation process. Improvement can be achieved via a deformable model such as
the snake model. In recent works, the deformable contour is modeled by means of
B-spline snakes which allows local control, concise representation, and the use
of fewer parameters. The estimation of the sub-pixel edges using a global
B-spline model relies on the contour global determination according to a
maximum likelihood framework and using the observed data likelihood. This
procedure guarantees that the noisiest data will be filtered out. The data
likelihood is computed as a consequence of the observation model which includes
both orientation and position information. Comparative experiments of this
algorithm and the classical spline interpolation have shown that the proposed
algorithm outperforms the classical approach for Gaussian and Salt & Pepper
noise.

urban short trips, and have been developed in many major cities around the
world. A major challenge in the study of bike sharing systems is that
large-scale and complex queueing networks have to be applied through
multi-dimensional Markov processes, while their discussion always suffers a
common difficulty: State space explosion. For this reason, this paper provides
a mean-field computational method to study such a large-scale bike sharing
steps: Firstly, a multi-dimensional Markov process is set up for expressing the
states of the bike sharing system, and the empirical process of the
multi-dimensional Markov process is given to partly overcome the difficulty of
state space explosion. Based on this, the mean-field equations are derived by
means of a virtual time-inhomogeneous M(t)/M(t)/1/K queue whose arrival and
service rates are determined by the mean-field computation. Secondly, the
martingale limit is employed to investigate the limiting behavior of the
empirical process, the fixed point is proved to be unique so that it can be
computed by means of a nonlinear birth-death process, the asymptotic
independence of this system is discussed simply, and specifically, these lead
to numerical computation of the steady-state probability of the problematic
(empty or full) stations. Finally, some numerical examples are given for
valuable observation on how the steady-state probability of the problematic
stations depends on some crucial parameters of the bike sharing system.

of the two fixed lines, parallel to the $X$-axis, distance $1+\epsilon$ ($0 <

edges between two interval graphs in a particular rule. It turns out that for
these kind of graphs, the chromatic number of any of its induced subgraphs is
bounded by twice of its (induced subgraph) clique number. This shows that the
graph, even though not perfect, is not very far from it. Then we prove similar
results for some subclasses of 2SIG and provide efficient algorithm for finding
their clique number. We provide a matrix characterization for a subclass of

the variability of the UV/optical lightcurves lags by progressively longer
times at longer wavelengths, as expected from reprocessing of an optically
thick disk, but that the timescales are longer than expected for a standard
Shakura-Sunyaev accretion disc. We build a full spectral-timing reprocessing
model to simulate the UV/optical lightcurves of NGC 5548. We show that disc
reprocessing of the observed hard X-ray lightcurve produces optical lightcurves
with too much fast variability as well as too short a lag time. Supressing the
fast variability requires an intervening structure preventing the hard X-rays
from illuminating the disc. We propose this is the disc itself, perhaps due to
atomic processes in the UV lifting the photosphere, increasing the
scale-height, making it less dense and less able to thermalise, so that it
radiates low temperature Comptonised emission as required to produce the soft
X-ray excess. The outer edge of the puffed-up Comptonised disc region emits FUV
flux, and can illuminate the outer thin blackbody disc but while this gives
reprocessed variable emission which is much closer to the observed UV and
optical lightcurves, the light travel lags are still too short to match the
data. We reverse engineer a solution to match the observations and find that
the luminosity and temperature of the lagged emission is not consistent with
material at the light travel lag distance responding to the irradiating flux
(either FUV or X-ray) from the AGN. We conclude that the UV/optical lags of NGC
5548 are not the light travel time from X-ray reprocessing, nor the light
travel time from FUV reprocessing, but instead could be the timescale for the
outer blackbody disc vertical structure to respond to the changing FUV
illumination.

statistical learning methods for Anomaly Detection/ranking. This paper proposes
a new algorithm based on multivariate EVT to learn how to rank observations in
a high dimensional space with respect to their degree of 'abnormality'. The
procedure relies on an original dimension-reduction technique in the extreme
domain that possibly produces a sparse representation of multivariate extremes
and allows to gain insight into the dependence structure thereof, escaping the
curse of dimensionality. The representation output by the unsupervised
methodology we propose here can be combined with any Anomaly Detection
technique tailored to non-extreme data. As it performs linearly with the
dimension and almost linearly in the data (in O(dn log n)), it fits to large
scale problems. The approach in this paper is novel in that EVT has never been
used in its multivariate version in the field of Anomaly Detection.
Illustrative experimental results provide strong empirical evidence of the

  Anatomy broadcasting","4 pages, 1 figure",,,,"physics.pop-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Seasonality is one of the oldest and most elucidation-resistant issues in
suicide epidemiological research. Despite winter depression (also known as
Seasonal Affective Disorder, SAD) is known and treated since many years,
worldwide cross-sectional data from 28 countries show a lower frequency of
suicide attempts around the equinoxes and a higher frequency in spring (both in
Northern and Southern Hemisphere). This peak is not compatible with the SAD
explanation. However, in recent years epidemiological research has yielded new
results, which provide new perspectives on the matter. In fact, the discovery
of a new pathology called Post-Series Depression (PSD) could provide an
explanation of the suicide attempts pattern. The aim of this study is to
analyse weekly data in order to compare them with the TV series broadcasting.
Since medical observations in our sample are distributed over many years, in
order to compare them as best as we can with the television programming, Grey's
Anatomy series was chosen. This medical drama has been in the top 10 of most
viewed TV series since 12 years and it is broadcast all over the world, so that
it can be considered a universal and homogeneous phenomenon. A full season of
the series is split into two separate units with a hiatus around the end of the
calendar year, and it runs from September through May. Data analysis was made
in order to prove the correlation between PSD and the increase of suicide
attempts. Surprisingly, the data analysis shows that the increase of rate of
suicide attempts does not coincide with the breaks in Grey's Anatomy
scheduling, but with the series broadcasting. This therefore suggests that it
is the series itself to increase the viewer's depression.

cores confined by a constant external pressure, assuming that cores are
isothermal and obey a spherically-symmetric density distribution. We model core
evolution for Plummer-like and Gaussian density distributions in the adiabatic
and isothermal limits, assuming Larson-like dissipation of turbulence. We model
the variation in the terms in the virial equation as a function of core
characteristic radius, and determine whether cores are evolving toward virial
equilibrium or gravitational collapse. We ignore accretion onto cores in the
current study. We discuss the different behaviours predicted by the isothermal
and adiabatic cases, and by our choice of index for the size-linewidth
relation, and suggest a means of parameterising the magnetic energy term in the
virial equation. We model the evolution of the set of cores observed by Pattle
et al. (2015) in the L1688 region of Ophiuchus in the 'virial plane'. We find
that not all virially-bound and pressure-confined cores will evolve to become
gravitationally bound, with many instead contracting to virial equilibrium with
their surroundings, and find an absence of gravitationally-dominated and
virially-unbound cores. We hypothesise a 'starless core desert' in this
quadrant of the virial plane, which may result from cores initially forming as
pressure-confined objects. We conclude that a virially-bound and
pressure-confined core will not necessarily evolve to become gravitationally
bound, and thus cannot be considered prestellar. A core can only be
definitively considered prestellar (collapsing to form an individual stellar
system) if it is gravitationally unstable.

gravitational collapse does not create an event horizon but only an apparent
one for a finite time. In this paper, we solve the equations of motion assuming
that the exterior solution is static. With such an assumption, we are able to
reconstruct the solution in the whole spacetime, namely in both the exterior

in a finite comoving time, but the central singularity is approached in an
infinite time. We argue that these black holes should be unstable, providing a

timescales of less than 1 Myr. Efficient radiative cooling of the supernova
remnant as well as strong compression of the surrounding gas result in
non-persistent energy and momentum input from the supernovae. However, if the
time between subsequent supernovae is short and they are clustered, large hot
bubbles form that disperse larger regions of the parental cloud. On longer
timescales, supernova feedback increases the amount of gas with moderate
temperatures (T~300-3000 K). Despite its inability to disrupt molecular clouds,
supernova feedback leaves a strong imprint on the star formation process. We
find an overall reduction of the star formation efficiency by a factor of 2 and

points-to information is computationally expensive. Many practical tools
approximate the points-to information trading precision for efficiency. This
has adverse impact on computationally intensive analyses such as model
checking. Past explorations in top-down approaches of fully flow- and
context-sensitive points-to analysis (FCPA) have not scaled. We explore the
alternative of bottom-up interprocedural approach which constructs summary flow
functions for procedures to represent the effect of their calls. This approach
has been effectively used for many analyses. However, it is computationally
expensive for FCPA which requires modelling unknown locations accessed
indirectly through pointers. Such accesses are commonly handled by using
placeholders to explicate unknown locations or by using multiple call-specific
summary flow functions.
  We generalize the concept of points-to relations by using the counts of
indirection levels leaving the unknown locations implicit. This allows us to
create summary flow functions in the form of generalized points-to graphs
(GPGs) without the need of placeholders. By design, GPGs represent both memory
(in terms of classical points-to facts) and memory transformers (in terms of
generalized points-to facts). We perform FCPA by progressively reducing
generalized points-to facts to classical points-to facts. GPGs distinguish
between may and must pointer updates thereby facilitating strong updates within
calling contexts.
  The size of GPG is linearly bounded by the number of variables and is
independent of the number of statements in the procedure. Empirical
measurements on SPEC benchmarks show that GPGs are indeed compact in spite of
large procedure sizes. This allows us to scale FCPA to 158 kLoC using GPGs
(compared to 35 kLoC reported by liveness-based FCPA).

millimeter-wave (mmWave) wireless fronthaul is preferred for information
exchange between the central processor and the distributed remote radio heads
(RRHs), due to its lower cost and higher flexibility in deployment, compared to
fixed optical links. This motivates our study in this paper on the downlink
transmission in a mmWave fronthaul enabled, orthogonal frequency division
multiple access (OFDMA) based UD-CRAN. In particular, the fronthaul is shared
among the RRHs via time division multiple access (TDMA), while the RRHs jointly
transmit to the users on orthogonal frequency subchannels using OFDMA. The
joint resource allocation over the TDMA-based mmWave fronthaul and OFDMA-based
wireless transmission is investigated to maximize the weighted sum rate of all
users. Although the problem is non-convex, we propose a Lagrange duality based
solution, which can be efficiently computed with good accuracy. To further
reduce the complexity, we also propose a greedy search based heuristic, which
achieves close to optimal performance under practical setups. Finally, we show
the significant throughput gains of the proposed joint resource allocation

standing currents. By further studying the effects of a harmonic lateral

transport properties of turbulent Taylor-Couette flow with inner rough wall up
to Taylor number $Ta=10^{10}$. The dimensionless torque $Nu_\omega$ shows an
effective scaling of $Nu_\omega \propto Ta^{0.42\pm0.01}$, which is steeper
than the ultimate regime effective scaling $Nu_\omega \propto Ta^{0.38}$ seen
for smooth inner and outer walls. It is found that at the inner rough wall, the
dominant contribution to the torque comes from the pressure forces on the
radial faces of the rough elements; while viscous shear stresses on the rough
surfaces contribute little to $Nu_\omega$. Thus, the log layer close to the
rough wall depends on the roughness length scale, rather than on the viscous
length scale. We then separate the torque contributed from the smooth inner
wall and the rough outer wall. It is found that the smooth wall torque scaling
follows $Nu_s \propto Ta_s^{0.38\pm0.01}$, in excellent agreement with the case
where both walls are smooth. In contrast, the rough wall torque scaling follows
$Nu_r \propto Ta_r^{0.47\pm0.03}$, very close to the pure ultimate regime
scaling $Nu_\omega \propto Ta^{1/2}$. The energy dissipation rate at the wall
of inner rough cylinder decreases significantly as a consequence of the wall
shear stress reduction caused by the flow separation at the rough elements. On
the other hand, the latter shed vortices in the bulk that are transported
towards the outer cylinder and dissipated. Compared to the purely smooth case,
the inner wall roughness renders the system more bulk dominated and thus
increases the effective scaling exponent.

with the larger distance between the Mn-atoms. However, the preferential
build-up orientation of the Mn-NN-pair depends on the surface reconstruction
and is parallel either to $[110]$ or $[1\bar{1}0]$ crystallographic direction.
We reveal also the mechanisms of the magnetic ordering of Mn-NN-pairs. The
Mn-NN-pairs along the $[110]$ crystallographic direction exhibit always
ferromagnetic alignment of Mn spins, whereas the spins in the Mn-NN-pairs along
$[1\bar{1}0]$ direction are mostly anti-ferromagnetically aligned. In the
electronic structure of the systems containing Mn-pairs with ferromagnetically
aligned spins, we observe the valence band hole states in the neighborhood of
Fermi energy. This indicates that the surface ferromagnetism in this prototype
of dilute magnetic semiconductors can be explained in terms of the $p$-$d$
Zener model.

the electron scattering optical depth measured by the Planck mission, make
galaxies plausible as dominant sources of ionizing photons during the epoch of
reionization. However, scenarios of galaxy-driven reionization hinge on the
assumption that the average escape fraction of ionizing photons is
significantly higher for galaxies in the reionization epoch than in the local
Universe. The NIRSpec instrument on the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) will
enable spectroscopic observations of large samples of reionization-epoch
galaxies. While the leakage of ionizing photons will not be directly measurable
from these spectra, the leakage is predicted to have an indirect effect on the
spectral slope and the strength of nebular emission lines in the rest-frame
ultraviolet and optical. Here, we apply a machine learning technique known as
lasso regression on mock JWST/NIRSpec observations of simulated $z=7$ galaxies
in order to obtain a model that can predict the escape fraction from
JWST/NIRSpec data. Barring systematic biases in the simulated spectra, our
method is able to retrieve the escape fraction with a mean absolute error of
$\Delta f_{\mathrm{esc}} \approx 0.12$ for spectra with $S/N\approx 5$ at a
rest-frame wavelength of 1500 {\AA} for our fiducial simulation. This

$\simeq 5.75$~My ago. The young age can be demonstrated by numerically
integrating the orbits of Karin cluster members backward in time and showing
the convergence of the perihelion and nodal longitudes (as well as other
orbital elements). Previous work has pointed out that the convergence is not
ideal if the backward integration only accounts for the gravitational
perturbations from the Solar System planets. It improves when the thermal
radiation force known as the Yarkovsky effect it is accounted for. This
argument can be used to estimate the spin obliquities of the Karin cluster
members. Here we take advantage of the fast growing membership of the Karin
cluster and show that the obliquity distribution of diameter $D\simeq 1-2$ km
Karin asteroids is bimodal, as expected if the YORP effect acted to move
obliquities toward the extreme values ($0^\circ$ or $180^\circ$). The measured
magnitude of the effect is consistent with the standard YORP model. The surface
thermal conductivity is inferred to be $0.07$-0.2 W m$^{-1}$ K$^{-1}$ (thermal
inertia $\simeq 300-500$ J m$^{-2}$ K$^{-1}$s$^{-1/2}$). We find that the
strength of the YORP effect is roughly $\simeq 0.7$ of the nominal strength
obtained for a collection of random Gaussian spheroids. These results are
consistent with a surface composed of rough, rocky regolith. The obliquity
values predicted here for 480 members of the Karin cluster can be validated by
the light-curve inversion method.

tractable classes of instances of fundamental problems in databases, such as
conjunctive queries and query containment, of the constraint satisfaction
problem in artificial intelligence, or more generally of the homomorphism
problem over relational structures. Most structural decomposition methods can
be characterized through hypergraph games that are variations of the Robber and
Cops graph game that characterizes the notion of treewidth. In particular,
decomposition trees somehow correspond to monotone winning strategies, where
the escape space of the robber on the hypergraph is shrunk monotonically by the
cops. In fact, unlike the treewidth case, there are hypergraphs where monotonic
strategies do not exist, while the robber can be captured by means of more
complex non-monotonic strategies. However, these powerful strategies do not
correspond in general to valid decompositions. The paper provides a general way
to exploit the power of non-monotonic strategies, by allowing a ""disciplined""
form of non-monotonicity, characteristic of cops playing in a greedy way. It is
shown that deciding the existence of a (non-monotone) greedy winning strategy
(and compute one, if any) is tractable. Moreover, despite their
non-monotonicity, such strategies always induce valid decomposition trees,
which can be computed efficiently based on them. As a consequence, greedy
strategies allow us to define new islands of tractability for the considered
problems properly including all previously known classes of tractable
instances.

Bennett acceptance-ratio method to compute the dimensionless free-energy
difference between a series of equilibrium simulations performed within this
object. The method produces results that are in excellent agreement with
thermodynamic integration, as well as a direct estimate of the associated
statistical uncertainties. The histogram method also allows us to directly
obtain an estimate of the interior radial probability density profile, thus
yielding useful insight into the structural properties of such a
high-dimensional body. We illustrate the method by analyzing the effect of
structural disorder on the basins of attraction of mechanically stable packings
of soft repulsive spheres.

increases precision and recall over a system with no privileged information: we
observe up to 7.7% relative decrease in detection error for fast-flux bot

correlated gamma band. If the GWs events might be born inside a globular
cluster, a star forming region or along a spiral AGN accretion disk their
additional accreting mass may be the needed baryon load to explode and shine:
in those dense places. BH BH collapse may also offer an optical X and gamma
afterglow via their baryon lightening and photon tracks. Only very nearby (tens
Mpc) BH Neutron Star (NS) or NS NS cannibal merging might be guaranteed and
associated also with a desired, visible and correlated spherical NS explosion
(kilonova one); they require much lower threshold or just nearer distances.
Indeed such a very exceptional GW170817 GRB170817a event occurred last August
2017; it took place and it was related to a very first NS NS collapse in a SN
kilonova spherical explosion. The GRB170817a gamma, X, radio signature it was
exceptional in many features . Its unique values (softer, weaker, the most near

However there are solid arguments that suggest that such a GRB are not just
blazing within a collimated beam jet but that they are also shining in a wider
spread gamma equatorial disk blazing, orthogonal to the jet itself. In a few
words we were observing the event not along its jet but mostly orthogonal to
it. This GRB170817a geometry may better explain the otherwise unexpected beamed
to us event. In this paper therefore we summarize the astrophysical and the
cosmological signature of such a long desired multiple astronomy.

symmetric variables with finite inter-layer Josephson coupling. Based on the
Kosterlitz-Thouless renormalization group (RG) approach, such phases were
predicted to exist in various layered (or 1D quantum coupled) systems. The key
in the RG argument is treating the coupling as though the variables are
non-compact. Large scale Monte Carlo simulations of a layered model, where the
SP is supposed to exist, finds no indication of such a phase. Instead, 3D
behavior is observed. This result is consistent with the asymptotically exact
analytical solution. A generic argument against SP in translationally invariant
systems with short range interactions is provided. We have also suggested an
alternative model for the SP -- adding long-range interactions to the
inter-layer Josephson term.

that are grouped into very short arcs (VSAs), each containing a few
observations of the same object in one single night. To decide whether two
VSAs, collected in different nights, refer to the same observed object we can
attempt to compute an orbit with the observations of both arcs: this is called
the linkage problem. Since the number of orbit computations to be performed is
very large, we need efficient methods of orbit determination. Using the first
integrals of Kepler's motion we can write algebraic equations for the linkage
problem, which can be put in polynomial form. The equations introduced in
(Gronchi et al. 2015) can be reduced to a univariate polynomial of degree 9:
the unknown is the topocentric distance $\rho$ of the observed body at the mean
epoch of one of the VSAs. Using elimination theory we show an optimal property
of this polynomial: it has the least degree among the univariate polynomials in
the same variable that are consequence of the algebraic conservation laws and
are obtained without squaring operations, that can be used to bring these
algebraic equations in polynomial form. In this paper we also introduce a
procedure to join three VSAs belonging to different nights: from the
conservation of angular momentum at the three mean epochs of the VSAs, we
obtain a univariate polynomial equation of degree 8 in the topocentric distance
$\rho_2$ at the intermediate epoch. This algorithm has the same computational
complexity as the classical method by Gauss, but uses more information,
therefore we expect that it can produce more accurate results. For both
methods, linking two and three VSAs, we also discuss how to select the
solutions, making use of the full two-body dynamics, and show some numerical
tests comparing the results with the ones obtained by Gauss' method.

in magnitude and direction. Transition from a stable configuration to the other
one can be produced by a mechanical or chemotactic perturbation. In order to
point out the mechanical nature of such a bistable behaviour, we focus on the
actin dynamics inside the cell using a minimal mathematical model. While the
protein diffusion, recruitment and segregation govern the polarization process,
we show that the free actin mass balance, driven by diffusion, and the
polymerized actin retrograde flow, regulated by the active stress, are
sufficient ingredients to account for the motile bistability. The length and
velocity of the cell are predicted on the basis of the parameters of the

the exchange among actin phases at the edges of the cell, that plays a central
role both in kinematics and in dynamics.
