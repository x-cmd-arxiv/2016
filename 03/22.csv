  Quasi-Incompressible Form and a Linear Energy-Stable Method","38 pages",,,,"physics.flu-dyn math-ph math.MP math.NA","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  While various phase-field models have recently appeared for two-phase fluids
with different densities, only some are known to be thermodynamically
consistent, and practical stable schemes for their numerical simulation are
lacking. In this paper, we derive a new form of thermodynamically-consistent
quasi-incompressible diffuse-interface Navier-Stokes Cahn-Hilliard model for a
two-phase flow of incompressible fluids with different densities. The
derivation is based on mixture theory by invoking the second law of
thermodynamics and Coleman-Noll procedure. We also demonstrate that our model
and some of the existing models are equivalent and we provide a unification
between them. In addition, we develop a linear and energy-stable
time-integration scheme for the derived model. Such a linearly-implicit scheme
is nontrivial, because it has to suitably deal with all nonlinear terms, in
particular those involving the density. Our proposed scheme is the first linear
method for quasi-incompressible two-phase flows with nonsolenoidal velocity
that satisfies discrete energy dissipation independent of the time-step size,
provided that the mixture density remains positive. The scheme also preserves
mass. Numerical experiments verify the suitability of the scheme for two-phase
flow applications with high density ratios using large time steps by
considering the coalescence and break-up dynamics of droplets including
pinching due to gravity.

  An Application to Parkinson's Disease",,,,,"stat.AP","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In many clinical trials studying neurodegenerative diseases such as
Parkinson's disease (PD), multiple longitudinal outcomes are collected to fully
explore the multidimensional impairment caused by this disease. If the outcomes
deteriorate rapidly, patients may reach a level of functional disability
sufficient to initiate levodopa therapy for ameliorating disease symptoms. An
accurate prediction of the time to functional disability is helpful for
clinicians to monitor patients' disease progression and make informative
medical decisions. In this article, we first propose a joint model that
consists of a semiparametric multilevel latent trait model (MLLTM) for the
multiple longitudinal outcomes, and a survival model for event time. The two
submodels are linked together by an underlying latent variable. We develop a
Bayesian approach for parameter estimation and a dynamic prediction framework
for predicting target patients' future outcome trajectories and risk of a
survival event, based on their multivariate longitudinal measurements. Our
proposed model is evaluated by simulation studies and is applied to the DATATOP
study, a motivating clinical trial assessing the effect of deprenyl among
patients with early PD.

minimum rank distance, which makes them suitable for error-correction in
network coding. In this paper, we study their security behaviour against

the following main results: 1) we give lower and upper bounds on their
generalized rank weights (GRWs), which measure worst-case information leakage
to the wire-tapper, 2) we find new parameters for which these codes are MRD
(meaning that their first GRW is optimal), and use the previous bounds to
estimate their higher GRWs, 3) we show that all linear (over the extension
field) codes whose GRWs are all optimal for fixed packet and code sizes but
varying length are reducible codes up to rank equivalence, and 4) we show that
the information leaked to a wire-tapper when using reducible codes is often
much less than the worst case given by their (optimal in some cases) GRWs. We
conclude with some secondary related properties: Conditions to be rank
equivalent to cartesian products of linear codes, conditions to be rank
degenerate, duality properties and MRD ranks.

a central task in the field of data mining and machine learning. A very popular
and powerful way of parameter estimation is the method of maximum likelihood
estimation (MLE). Among the most widely used families of statistical models are
mixture models, especially, mixtures of Gaussian distributions. A popular
hard-clustering variant of the MLE problem is the so-called complete-data
maximum likelihood estimation (CMLE) method. The standard approach to solve the
CMLE problem is the Classification-Expectation-Maximization (CEM) algorithm.
Unfortunately, it is only guaranteed that the algorithm converges to some
(possibly arbitrarily poor) stationary point of the objective function.
  In this paper, we present two algorithms for a restricted version of the CMLE
problem. That is, our algorithms approximate reasonable solutions to the CMLE
problem which satisfy certain natural properties. Moreover, they compute
solutions whose cost (i.e. complete-data log-likelihood values) are at most a
factor $(1+\epsilon)$ worse than the cost of the solutions that we search for.
Note the CMLE problem in its most general, i.e. unrestricted, form is not well
defined and allows for trivial optimal solutions that can be thought of as
degenerated solutions.

  Comments welcome !",,,,"math.DS","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  How is it possible to read the dynamical properties (ie when the time goes to
infinity) of a system on numerical simulations? To try to answer this question,
we study in this manuscript a model reflecting what happens when the orbits of
a discrete time system $f$ (for example an homeomorphism) are computed
numerically . The computer working in finite numerical precision, it will
replace $f$ by a spacial discretization of $f$, denoted by $f_N$ (where the
order $N$ of discretization stands for the numerical accuracy). In particular,
we will be interested in the dynamical behaviour of the finite maps $f_N$ for a
generic system $f$ and $N$ going to infinity, where generic will be taken in
the sense of Baire (mainly among sets of homeomorphisms or
$C^1$-diffeomorphisms).
  The first part of this manuscript is devoted to the study of the dynamics of
the discretizations $f_N$, when $f$ is a generic conservative/dissipative
homeomorphism of a compact manifold. We show that it would be mistaken to try
to recover the dynamics of $f$ from that of a single discretization $f_N$ : its
dynamics strongly depends on the order $N$. To detect some dynamical features
of $f$, we have to consider all the discretizations $f_N$ when $N$ goes through
$\mathbf N$.
  The second part deals with the linear case, which plays an important role in
the study of $C^1$-generic diffeomorphisms, discussed in the third part of this
manuscript. Under these assumptions, we obtain results similar to those
established in the first part, though weaker and harder to prove.

$\vec{\gamma} p \rightarrow K^+ \Lambda$ and $\vec{\gamma} p \rightarrow K^+

designed to study the spectrum of baryon resonances.
  Purpose: The accurate measurement of several polarization observables
provides tight constraints for phenomenological fits. Beam-recoil observables
for the $\vec{\gamma} p \rightarrow K^+ \Sigma^0$ reaction have not been
reported before now.
  Method: The measurements were carried out using linearly polarized photon
beams and the CLAS detector at the Thomas Jefferson National Accelerator
Facility. The energy range of the results is 1.71\,GeV $<W<$ 2.19\,GeV, with an
angular range $-0.75 < \cos\theta^{\star}_K < +0.85$.
  Results: The observables extracted for both reactions are beam asymmetry
$\Sigma$, target asymmetry $T$, and the beam-recoil double polarization
observables $O_x$ and $O_z$.
  Conclusions: Comparison with theoretical fits indicates that in the regions
where no previous data existed, the new data contain significant new
information, and strengthen the evidence for the set of resonances used in the
latest Bonn-Gatchina fit.

generalization of Multiple Instance Learning (MIL). In eFUMI, only bag level
(i.e. set level) labels are needed to estimate target signatures from mixed
data. The training bags in eFUMI are labeled positive if any data point in a
bag contains or represents any proportion of the target signature and are
labeled as a negative bag if all data points in the bag do not represent any
target. From these imprecise labels, eFUMI has been shown to be effective at
estimating target signatures in hyperspectral subpixel target detection
problems. One motivating scenario for the use of eFUMI is where an analyst
circles objects/regions of interest in a hyperspectral scene such that the
target signatures of these objects can be estimated and be used to determine
whether other instances of the object appear elsewhere in the image collection.
The regions highlighted by the analyst serve as the imprecise labels for eFUMI.
Often, an analyst may want to iteratively refine their imprecise labels. In
this paper, we present an approach for estimating the influence on the
estimated target signature if the label for a particular input data point is
modified. This ""instance influence estimation"" guides an analyst to focus on
(re-)labeling the data points that provide the largest change in the resulting
estimated target signature and, thus, reduce the amount of time an analyst
needs to spend refining the labels for a hyperspectral scene. Results are shown
on real hyperspectral sub-pixel target detection data sets.

to the top of the planetary atmosphere. We investigate effects that may result
from a high flux of galactic cosmic rays both throughout the atmosphere and at
the planetary surface. Using an air shower approach, we calculate how the
atmospheric chemistry and temperature change under the influence of galactic
cosmic rays for Earth-like (N_2-O_2 dominated) atmospheres. We evaluate the
production and destruction rate of atmospheric biosignature molecules. We
derive planetary emission and transmission spectra to study the influence of
galactic cosmic rays on biosignature detectability. We then calculate the
resulting surface UV flux, the surface particle flux, and the associated
equivalent biological dose rates. We find that up to 20% of stratospheric ozone
is destroyed by cosmic-ray protons. The reduction of the planetary ozone layer
leads to an increase in the weighted surface UV flux by two orders of magnitude
under stellar UV flare conditions. The resulting biological effective dose rate
is, however, too low to strongly affect surface life. We also examine the
surface particle flux: For a planet with a terrestrial atmosphere, a reduction
of the magnetic shielding efficiency can increase the biological radiation dose
rate by a factor of two. For a planet with a weaker atmosphere (with a surface
pressure of 97.8 hPa), the planetary magnetic field has a much stronger
influence on the biological radiation dose, changing it by up to two orders of
magnitude.

rotational variability and a superimposed beating pattern. To study the stars
that produce such an intriguing pattern of photometric variability, we
identified a sample of eight stars with rotation periods between 0.8 and 11
days and photometric variability amplitudes of up to 7.5 %, showing a similar
CoRoT light curve. We also obtained high-resolution follow-up spectroscopy with
TNG/SARG and carried out a spectral analysis with SME and MOOG. We find that
the color dependence of the light curves is consistent with rotational
modulation due to starspots and that latitudinal differential rotation provides
a viable explanation for the light curves, although starspot evolution is also
expected to play an important role. Our MOOG and SME spectral analyses provide
consistent results, showing that the targets are dwarf stars with spectral
types between F and mid-K. Detectable Li i absorption in four of the targets
confirms a low age of 100-400 Myr also deduced from gyrochronology. Our study
indicates that the photometric beating phenomenon is likely attributable to
differential rotation in fast-rotating stars with outer convection zones.

graviton power spectrum. In the Einstein-Hilbert approximation for the

equivalently from a product of mode functions which solve the linearized
Einstein equations. In contrast, the product of mode functions, often employed
in the context of cosmology, does not yield the correlation function for the
vector and scalar components of the metric fluctuations. We divide the metric
fluctuations into ""physical fluctuations"", which couple to a conserved energy
momentum tensor, and gauge fluctuations. On the subspace of physical metric
fluctuations the relation to physical sources becomes invertible, such that the
effective action and its relation to correlation functions no longer needs to
involve a gauge fixing term. The physical metric fluctuations have a similar
status as the Bardeen potentials, while being formulated in a covariant way. We
compute the effective action for the physical metric fluctuations for

since the fractional derivative operators that often used are all
pseudo-differential. Then high regularity situation---the image spaces of

impact of a planet-sized object with the proto-Earth towards the end of
planetary accretion. Modeling of the impact process predicts that the lunar
material was disaggregated into a circumplanetary disk and that lunar accretion
subsequently placed the Moon in a near equatorial orbit. Forward integration of
the lunar orbit from this initial state predicts a modern inclination at least
an order of magnitude smaller than the lunar value, a long-standing discrepancy
known as the lunar inclination problem. Here we show that the modern lunar
orbit provides a sensitive record of gravitational interactions with
Earth-crossing planetesimals not yet accreted at the time of the Moon-forming
event. The excited lunar orbit can naturally be reproduced via interaction with
a small quantity of mass (corresponding to 0.0075-0.015 ME eventually accreted
to the Earth) carried by a few bodies, consistent with constraints and models
of late accretion. While the process has a stochastic element, the observed
value of the lunar inclination is among the most likely outcomes for a wide
range of parameters. The excitation of the lunar orbit is most readily
reproduced via collisionless encounters with strong tidal dissipation on the
early Earth. This mechanism obviates the necessity of previously proposed (but
idealized) excitation mechanisms and can constrain the planet formation context
of the Moon-forming event and the pristineness of the dynamical state of the
Earth-Moon system.

an oscillating grid. Synchronized and overlapping particle image velocimetry
and planar laser induced fluorescence measurements have been conducted
capturing the evolution of the patch through its initial growth until it
reached a maximum size, followed by its collapse. The simultaneous measurements
of density and velocity fields allow for a direct quantification of the degree
of mixing within the patch, the propagation speed of the
turbulent/non-turbulent interface and its thickness. The velocity measurements
indicate significant non-equilibrium effects inside the patch which are not
consistent with the classical used grid-action model. A local analysis of the
turbulent/non-turbulent interface provides direct measurements of the
entrainment velocity $w_{e}$ as compared to the local vertical velocity and
turbulent intensity at the proximity of the interface. It is found that the
entrainment rate $E$ is constrained in the range of $0{\div}0.1$ and that the
local, gradient Richardson number at the interface is $\mathcal{O} (100)$.
Finally, we show that the mean flow is responsible for the patch collapse.

points spanning a wide range of WIMP mass, different annihilation final states,
and large enough event rates to warrant detection in one or more experiments.
As previously shown, below some 100 GeV only direct detection experiments will
in principle be able to reconstruct the WIMP mass well. This may, in case a
signal at Fermi-LAT is also detected, additionally help restricting \sigma v
and the allowed decay branching rates. In the intermediate range between some
100 GeV and up a few hundred GeV, direct and indirect detection experiments can
be used in complementarity to ameliorate the respective determinations, which
in individual experiments can at best be rather poor, thus making the WIMP
reconstruction in this mass range very challenging. At large WIMP mass, ~1 TeV,
CTA will have the ability to reconstruct mass, annihilation cross section, and
the allowed decay branching rates to very good precision for the $\tau^+\tau^-$
or purely leptonic final state, good for the $W^+W^-$ case, and rather poor for
$b\bar{b}$. A substantial improvement can potentially be achieved by reducing
the systematic uncertainties, increasing exposure, or by an additional
measurement at Fermi-LAT that would help reconstruct the annihilation cross
section and the allowed branching fractions to different final states.

coherent fermionic fluid. Using a scattering field theory, we theoretically
analyse the single-scatterer and the two-scatterer case. Concerning the
single-scatterer case, we find that a net force affects the scatterer dynamics
only in non-equilibrium condition, i.e. imposing the presence of a
non-vanishing particle current flowing through the system. The force
fluctuation (variance) is instead not negligible both in equilibrium and in
non-equilibrium conditions. Concerning the two-scatterer case, an attractive
fluid-mediated Casimir force is experienced by the scatterers at small spatial
separation, while a decaying attractive/repulsive behavior as a function of the
scatterer separation is found. Furthermore, the Casimir force fluctuations
acting on a given scatterer in close vicinity of the other present an
oscillating behavior reaching a long distance limit comparable to the value of
the single-scatterer case. The relevance of these findings is discussed in
connection with fluctuation phenomena in low-dimensional nanostructures and
cold atoms systems.

identified by their Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect signature in the 2500 square
degree South Pole Telescope Sunyaev Zel'dovich survey. We consider the 377
cluster candidates identified at z>0.25 with a detection significance greater
than five, corresponding to the 95% purity threshold for the survey. We compute
constraints on cosmological models using the measured cluster abundance as a
function of mass and redshift. We include additional constraints from
multi-wavelength observations, including Chandra X-ray data for 82 clusters and
a weak lensing-based prior on the normalization of the mass-observable scaling
relations. Assuming a LCDM cosmology, where the species-summed neutrino mass
has the minimum allowed value (mnu = 0.06 eV) from neutrino oscillation
experiments, we combine the cluster data with a prior on H0 and find sigma_8 =
0.797+-0.031 and Omega_m = 0.289+-0.042, with the parameter combination
sigma_8(Omega_m/0.27)^0.3 = 0.784+-0.039. These results are in good agreement
with constraints from the CMB from SPT, WMAP, and Planck, as well as with
constraints from other cluster datasets. Adding mnu as a free parameter, we
find mnu = 0.14+-0.08 eV when combining the SPT cluster data with Planck CMB
data and BAO data, consistent with the minimum allowed value. Finally, we
consider a cosmology where mnu and N_eff are fixed to the LCDM values, but the
dark energy equation of state parameter w is free. Using the SPT cluster data
in combination with an H0 prior, we measure w = -1.28+-0.31, a constraint
consistent with the LCDM cosmological model and derived from the combination of
growth of structure and geometry. When combined with primarily geometrical
constraints from Planck CMB, H0, BAO and SNe, adding the SPT cluster data
improves the w constraint from the geometrical data alone by 14%, to w =
-1.023+-0.042.

the BL Lac object H1722+119 (redshift unknown) for six consecutive nights
between 2013 May 17 and 22, for a total of 12.5 h. The observations were
triggered by high activity in the optical band measured by the KVA (Kungliga
Vetenskapsakademien) telescope. The source was for the first time detected in
the very high energy (VHE, $E > 100$ GeV) $\gamma$-ray band with a statistical
significance of 5.9 $\sigma$. The integral flux above 150 GeV is estimated to
be $(2.0\pm 0.5)$ per cent of the Crab Nebula flux. We used contemporaneous
high energy (HE, 100 MeV $ < E < 100$ GeV) $\gamma$-ray observations from
Fermi-LAT (Large Area Telescope) to estimate the redshift of the source. Within
the framework of the current extragalactic background light models, we estimate
the redshift to be $z = 0.34 \pm 0.15$. Additionally, we used contemporaneous
X-ray to radio data collected by the instruments on board the Swift satellite,
the KVA, and the OVRO (Owens Valley Radio Observatory) telescope to study
multifrequency characteristics of the source. We found no significant temporal
variability of the flux in the HE and VHE bands. The flux in the optical and
radio wavebands, on the other hand, did vary with different patterns. The
spectral energy distribution (SED) of H1722+119 shows surprising behaviour in

the form of OH has been unambiguously observed in Apollo samples in recent
years. Such observations have prompted questions about the abundance and
distribution of lunar hydrogen. Here, we investigate the related question of
the origin of lunar H: is the hydrogen observed a remnant of a much larger
initial inventory that was inherited from a wet Earth but partly depleted
during the process of origin, or was hydrogen quantitatively lost from the
lunar material, with water being delivered to lunar reservoirs via subsequent
impacts after the origins sequence? Motivated by recent results pointing to a
limited extent of hydrogen escape from the gravity field of the Earth during
lunar origin, we apply a newly developed thermodynamic model of liquid-vapor
silicates to the proto-lunar disk to interrogate the behavior of H as a trace
element in the energetic aftermath of the giant impact. We find that: (1)
pre-existing H-bearing molecules are rapidly dissociated at the temperatures
considered (3,100-4,200 K) and vaporized hydrogen predominantly exists as
OH(v), H(v) and MgOH(v) for nearly the full range of thermal states encountered
in the proto-lunar disk, (2) despite such a diversity in the vapor speciation,
which reduces the water fugacity and favors hydrogen exsolution from
co-existing liquids, the equilibration of the vapor atmosphere with the disk
liquid results in significant dissolution of H into proto-lunar magmas, and (3)
equilibrium H isotopic fractionation in this setting is limited to < 10 per mil
and the terrestrial character of lunar D/H recently inferred should extend to
such a precision if liquid-vapor equilibration in the proto-lunar disk is the
process that gave rise to lunar hydrogen. Taken together, these results
implicate dissolution as the process responsible for establishing lunar H
abundances.

(folded RBF), acos, and acos-$\chi^2$, on a wide range of publicly available
datasets. The proposed fRBF kernel performs very similarly to the RBF kernel.
Both RBF and fRBF kernels require an important tuning parameter ($\gamma$).
Interestingly, for a significant portion of the datasets, the min-max kernel
outperforms the best-tuned RBF/fRBF kernels. The acos kernel and acos-$\chi^2$
kernel also perform well in general and in some datasets achieve the best
accuracies.
  One crucial issue with the use of nonlinear kernels is the excessive
computational and memory cost. These days, one increasingly popular strategy is
to linearize the kernels through various randomization algorithms. In our
study, the randomization method for the min-max kernel demonstrates excellent
performance compared to the randomization methods for other types of nonlinear
kernels, measured in terms of the number of nonzero terms in the transformed
dataset.
  Our study provides evidence for supporting the use of the min-max kernel and
the corresponding randomized linearization method (i.e., the so-called ""0-bit
CWS""). Furthermore, the results motivate at least two directions for future
research: (i) To develop new (and linearizable) nonlinear kernels for better
accuracies; and (ii) To develop better linearization algorithms for improving
the current linearization methods for the RBF kernel, the acos kernel, and the
acos-$\chi^2$ kernel. One attempt is to combine the min-max kernel with the
acos kernel or the acos-$\chi^2$ kernel. The advantages of these two new and
tuning-free nonlinear kernels are demonstrated vias our extensive experiments.

consider an asteroid that orbits the Sun in quasi-satellite motion with a
planet. A quasi-satellite trajectory is a heliocentric orbit in co-orbital
resonance with the planet, characterized by a non zero eccentricity and a
resonant angle that librates around zero. Likewise, in the rotating frame with
the planet it describes the same trajectory as the one of a retrograde
satellite even though the planet acts as a perturbator. In the last few years,
the discoveries of asteroids in this type of motion made the term
""quasi-satellite"" more and more present in the literature. However, some
authors rather use the term ""retrograde satellite"" when referring to this kind
of motion in the studies of the restricted problem in the rotating frame. In
this paper we intend to clarify the terminology to use, in order to bridge the
gap between the perturbative co-orbital point of view and the more general
approach in the rotating frame. Through a numerical exploration of the
co-orbital phase space, we describe the quasi-satellite domain and highlight
that it is not reachable by low eccentricities by averaging process. We will
show that the quasi-satellite domain is effectively included in the domain of
the retrograde satellites and neatly defined in terms of frequencies.
Eventually, we highlight a remarkable high eccentric quasi-satellite orbit
corresponding to a frozen ellipse in the heliocentric frame. We extend this
result to the eccentric case (planet on an eccentric motion) and show that two
families of frozen ellipses originate from this remarkable orbit.

bitmap compression techniques have been proposed, almost all relying primarily
on run-length encoding (RLE). However, on unsorted data, we can get superior
performance with a hybrid compression technique that uses both uncompressed
bitmaps and packed arrays inside a two-level tree. An instance of this
technique, Roaring, has recently been proposed. Due to its good performance, it
has been adopted by several production platforms (e.g., Apache Lucene, Apache
Spark, Apache Kylin and Druid).
  Yet there are cases where run-length encoded bitmaps are smaller than the
original Roaring bitmaps---typically when the data is sorted so that the
bitmaps contain long compressible runs. To better handle these cases, we build
a new Roaring hybrid that combines uncompressed bitmaps, packed arrays and RLE
compressed segments. The result is a new Roaring format that compresses better.
  Overall, our new implementation of Roaring can be several times faster (up to
two orders of magnitude) than the implementations of traditional RLE-based
alternatives (WAH, Concise, EWAH) while compressing better. We review the
design choices and optimizations that make these good results possible.

the case of non-uniform weights, using a coupling between the two samples. When
the items' weights are arranged in the same order as their values, we show that
the induced coupling for the cumulative values is a submartingale coupling. As
a consequence, the powerful Chernoff-type upper-tail estimates known for
sampling with replacement automatically transfer to the case of sampling
without replacement. For general weights, we use the same coupling to establish
a sub-Gaussian concentration inequality. We also construct another martingale
coupling which allows us to answer a question raised by Luh and Pippenger

current measurements of baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO). The JLA data are
analyzed with the SALT2 light-curve fitter and the model selection is then

that the JLA data alone are unable to distinguish the standard $\Lambda$CDM
model from some of its alternatives but its combination with current
measurements of baryon acoustic oscillations shows up an ability to distinguish
them. In particular, the DGP model is practically not supported by both the BAO

we then show that for both spin-0 and spin-2 Standard Model (SM) gauge-singlet

occur with a non-zero rate. Moreover, we demonstrate that these branching
ratios are highly correlated in the EFT. Couplings of S to additional SM states
may be constrained and differentiated by comparing the S production rates with

unfeasible, because the number of ab initio spectral model grid calculations
scales exponentially with $\mathcal{N}$. We suggest instead the construction of
a polynomial spectral model (PSM) of order $\mathcal{O}$ for the model flux at
each wavelength. Building this approximation requires a minimum of only
${\mathcal{N}+\mathcal{O}\choose\mathcal{O}}$ calculations: e.g. a quadratic
spectral model ($\mathcal{O}=2$) to fit $\mathcal{N}=20$ labels simultaneously,
can be constructed from as few as $231$ ab initio spectral model calculations;
in practice, a somewhat larger number ($\sim 300-1000$) of randomly chosen
models lead to a better performing PSM. Such a PSM can be a good approximation
only over a portion of label space, which will vary case by case. Yet, taking
the APOGEE survey as an example, a single quadratic PSM provides a remarkably
good approximation to the exact ab initio spectral models across much of this
survey: for random labels within that survey the PSM approximates the flux to
within $10^{-3}$, and recovers the abundances to within $\sim 0.02$ dex rms of
the exact models. This enormous speed-up enables the simultaneous many-label
fitting of spectra with computationally expensive ab initio models for stellar

cosmic-ray electron population within the volume of the Bubbles, via inverse
Compton scattering and synchrotron radiation respectively. The relative rates
of these processes are set by the relative energy density of the interstellar
radiation field and the magnetic field within the Bubbles; consequently, under
the hypothesis of a common origin, the combination of the gamma-ray and

latitude-by-latitude basis, using data from Fermi, WMAP and Planck; estimate
the variation of the electron spectrum within the Bubbles; and infer bounds on
the magnetic field within the Bubbles as a function of distance from the

generally consistent with the leptonic hypothesis for few-microGauss magnetic
fields, there appears to be a preference for spectral hardening in the
microwaves at mid-latitudes (especially in the |b|~ 25-35 degree range) that is
not mirrored in the gamma rays. This result may hint at a non-leptonic
contribution to the gamma-ray spectra; however, the discrepancy can be
reconciled in purely leptonic models if the cutoff energy for the electrons is
lower in this latitude range and the spectrum below the cutoff is harder.

spherically- symmetric excess of GeV gamma rays extending to at least 10 deg
from the dynamical center of the Galaxy. A critical uncertainty in extracting
the intensity, spectrum, and morphology of this excess concerns the accuracy of
astrophysical diffuse gamma-ray emission models near the GC. Recently, it has
been noted that many diffuse emission models utilize a cosmic-ray injection
rate far below that predicted based on the observed star formation rate in the
Central Molecular Zone. In this study, we add a cosmic-ray injection component
which non-linearly traces the Galactic H2 density determined in
three-dimensions, and find that the associated gamma-ray emission is degenerate
with many properties of the GC gamma-ray excess. In models that utilize a large
sideband (40x40 deg surrounding the GC) to normalize the best-fitting diffuse
emission models, the intensity of the GC excess decreases by a factor of 2, and
the morphology of the excess becomes less peaked and less spherically
symmetric. In models which utilize a smaller region of interest (15x15 deg) the
addition of an excess template instead suppresses the intensity of the best-fit
astrophysical diffuse emission, and the GC excess is rather resilient to
changes in the details of the astrophysical diffuse modeling. In both analyses,
the addition of a GC excess template still provides a statistically significant
improvement to the overall fit to the gamma-ray data. We also implement
advective winds at the GC, and find that the Fermi-LAT data strongly prefer
outflows of order several hundred km/s, whose role is to efficiently advect
low-energy cosmic rays from the Galactic center. Finally, we perform numerous
tests of our models, and conclude that they significantly improve our
understanding of multi-wavelength non-thermal emission from the GC.

ISW and LSS maps, we study the impact of galaxy survey properties and
systematic errors on the accuracy of reconstructed ISW signal. We find that
systematics that affect the observed distribution of galaxies along the line of
sight, such as photo-z and bias-evolution related errors, have a relatively
minor impact on reconstruction quality. In contrast, however, we find that
direction-dependent calibration errors can be very harmful. Specifically, we
find that in order to avoid significant degradation of our reconstruction
quality statistics, direction-dependent number density fluctuations due to
systematics must be controlled so that their variance is smaller than $10^{-6}$
(which corresponds to a 0.1% calibration). Additionally, we explore the
implications of our results for attempts to use reconstructed ISW maps to shed
light on the origin of large-angle CMB alignments. We find that there is only a
weak correlation between the true and reconstructed angular momentum
dispersion, which quantifies alignment, even for reconstructed ISW maps which
are fairly accurate overall.

scalar fields with ever-increasing precision. As experiments become more
precise, so too must theoretical predictions. Previous work has made numerous
approximations to simplify the calculation, which in general requires solving a
3-dimensional nonlinear partial differential equation (PDE). In this paper, we
introduce a new technique for calculating the chameleonic force, using a
numerical relaxation scheme on a uniform grid. This technique is more general
than previous work, which assumed spherical symmetry to reduce the PDE to a
1-dimensional ordinary differential equation (ODE). We examine the effects of
approximations made in previous efforts on this subject, and calculate the
chameleonic force in a set-up that closely mimics the recent experiment of
Hamilton et al. Specifically, we simulate the vacuum chamber as a cylinder with
dimensions matching those of the experiment, taking into account the
backreaction of the source mass, its offset from the center, and the effects of
the chamber walls. Remarkably, the acceleration on a test atomic particle is
found to differ by only 20% from the approximate analytical treatment. These
results allow us to place rigorous constraints on the parameter space of
chameleon field theories, although ultimately the constraint we find is the
same as the one we reported in Hamilton et al. because we had slightly
underestimated the size of the vacuum chamber. This new computational technique
will continue to be useful as experiments become even more precise, and will
also be a valuable tool in optimizing future searches for chameleon fields and
related theories.

flat part of the rotation curve, Vflat, at the extent of HI gas, Vlast, and
using 20% (W20) and 50% (W50) of the width of HI line profiles. We also compare
with the maximum circular velocity of the parent halo, Vmax, within dark matter
only simulations. The different BTFRs increasingly diverge as galaxy mass
decreases. Using Vlast one obtains a power law over four orders of magnitude in
baryonic mass, with slope similar to the observed BTFR. Measuring Vflat gives
similar results as Vlast when galaxies with rising rotation curves are
excluded. However, higher rotation velocities would be found for low mass
galaxies if the cold gas extended far enough for Vrot to reach a maximum. W20
gives a similar slope as Vlast but with slightly lower values of Vrot for low
mass galaxies, although this may depend on the extent of the gas in your galaxy
sample. W50 bends away from these other relations toward low velocities at low
masses. By contrast, Vmax bends toward high velocities for low mass galaxies,
as cold gas does not extend out to the radius at which halos reach Vmax. Our
study highlights the need for careful comparisons between observations and

coupling continues to generate tremendous interest, with an elusive quantum
disordered phase in the vicinity of $J_2$ = $J_1$/2. At this precise value of
frustration, the classical model has a very large degeneracy which makes the
problem difficult to handle. We show that introducing a ferromagnetic $J_3$
coupling partially lifts this degeneracy. It gives rise to a four-site magnetic
unit cell with the constraint that the spins on every square must add to zero.
This leads to a two-parameter family of ground states and an emergent vector
order parameter. We reinterpret this family of ground states as coexistence
states of three spirals. Using spin wave analysis, we show that thermal and
quantum fluctuations break this degeneracy differently. Thermal fluctuations
break it down to a threefold degeneracy with a N\'eel phase and two stripe
phases. This threefold symmetry is restored via a $Z_3$ thermal transition, as
we demonstrate using classical Monte Carlo simulations. On the other hand,
quantum fluctuations select the N\'eel state. In the extreme quantum limit of
spin-$1/2$, we use exact diagonalization to demonstrate N\'eel ordering beyond
a critical $J_3$ coupling. For weak $J_3$, a variational approach suggests an
$s$-wave plaquette-RVB state. Away from the $J_2 = J_1/2$ line, we show that
quantum fluctuations favour N\'eel ordering strongly enough to stabilize it

temperatures suggests that the emission is dominated by optically thick winds
driven by super-Eddington accretion. We present a general analytical theory of
the dynamics of radiation pressure-driven, optically thick winds. Unlike the
classical adiabatic stellar wind solution whose dynamics are solely determined
by the sonic radius, here the loss of the radiation pressure due to photon
diffusion also plays an important role. We identify two high mass loss rate
regimes ($\dot{M} > L_{\rm Edd\,}/c^2$). In the large total luminosity regime
the solution resembles an adiabatic wind solution. Both the radiative
luminosity, $L$, and the kinetic luminosity, $L_k$, are super-Eddington with $L
< L_k$ and $L \propto L_k^{1/3}$. In the lower total luminosity regime most of
the energy is carried out by the radiation with $L_k < L \approx L_{\rm
Edd\,}$. In a third, low mass loss regime ($\dot{M} < L_{\rm Edd\,}/c^2$), the
wind becomes optically thin early on and, unless gas pressure is important at
this stage, the solution is very different from the adiabatic one. The results
are independent from the energy generation mechanism at the foot of the wind,
therefore they are applicable to a wide range of mass ejection systems, from
black hole accretion, to planetary nebulae, and to classical novae.

captures an $x_p$-dependent decrease in the average interaction strength of the
nucleon in the projectile undergoing a hard scattering. A weakly interacting or
""shrinking"" nucleon in the projectile strikes fewer nucleons in the nucleus,
resulting in a particular pattern of centrality-dependent modifications to
high-$p_T$ processes. We describe a simple one-parameter geometric
implementation of this picture within a modified Monte Carlo Glauber model
tuned to $d$$+$Au jet data, and explore two of its major consequences. First,
the model predicts a particular projectile-species dependence to the centrality
dependence at high-$x_p$, opposite to that expected from an energy loss effect.
Second, we find that some of the large centrality dependence observed for
forward di-hadron production in $d$$+$Au collisions at RHIC may arise from the
physics of the ""shrinking"" projectile nucleon, in addition to impact
parameter-dependent shadowing or saturation effects at low nuclear-$x$. We
conclude that analogous measurements in recently collected $p$$+$Au and

component in dissociating H$_2$ and allowing for the formation of a direct

amounts of hydrogen ionising photons and X-ray photons. We study here the
feedback effects of the X-ray photons by including a spectrum due to high-mass
X-ray binaries on top of a galaxy with a stellar spectrum. We explicitly trace
photon packages emerging from the nearby source and track the radiative and
chemical effects of the multi-frequency source $(E_{\rm photon} = \rm{0.76\ eV
\rightarrow 7500\ eV}$). We find that X-rays have a strongly negative feedback
effect, compared to a stellar only source, when the radiative source is placed
at a separation greater than $\gtrsim 1 \ \rm kpc$. The X-rays heat the low and
medium density gas in the envelope surrounding the collapsing halo suppressing
the mass inflow. The result is a smaller enclosed mass compared to the stellar
only case. However, for separations of $\lesssim 1 \ \rm kpc$, the feedback
effects of the X-rays becomes somewhat neutral. The enhanced LW intensity at
close separations dissociates more H$_2$ and this gas is heated due to stellar
photons alone, the addition of X-rays is then not significant. This distance
dependence of X-ray feedback suggests that a Goldilocks zone exists close to a
forming galaxy where X-ray photons have a much smaller negative feedback effect
and ideal conditions exist for creating massive black hole seeds.

streams than the number of its antennas, the BS or user usually utilizes the
singular value decomposition (SVD) factorizations to get the effective
channels, whose dimension is equal to the num of streams. This process is
called channel reconstruction in BS for TDD mode. However, with the increasing
of antennas in BS, the computation burden of SVD is becoming incredibly high.
As a countermeasure, we propose a series of novel low-complexity channel
reconstruction methods for downlink zero-forcing precoding (ZF). We adopt
randomized algorithms to construct an approximate SVD, which could reduce the
dimensions of the matrix, especially when approximating an input matrix with a
low-rank element. Besides, this method could automatically modify the
parameters to adapt arbitrary number demand of streams from users. The
simulation results show that the proposed methods only cost less than 30% float
computation than the traditional SVD-ZF method, while keeping nearly the same

thermoelectric properties. The idea is to filter away low-energy charge
carriers in order to increase Seebeck coefficient without compromising
electronic conductivity. This concept was investigated in the present paper for
a specific material (ZnSb) by a combination of first-principles atomic-scale
calculations, Boltzmann transport theory, and experimental studies of the same
system. The potential of filtering in this material was first quantified, and
it was as an example found that the power factor could be enhanced by an order
of magnitude when the filter barrier height was 0.5~eV. Measured values of the
Hall carrier concentration in bulk ZnSb were then used to calibrate the
transport calculations, and nanostructured ZnSb with average grain size around
70~nm was processed to achieve filtering as suggested previously in the
literature. Various scattering mechanisms were employed in the transport
calculations and compared with the measured transport properties in
nanostructured ZnSb as a function of temperature. Reasonable correspondence
between theory and experiment could be achieved when a combination of constant
lifetime scattering and energy filtering with a 0.25~eV barrier was employed.
However, the difference between bulk and nanostructured samples was not
sufficient to justify the introduction of an energy filtering mechanism. The
reasons for this and possibilities to achieve filtering were discussed in the
paper.

yawing has been shown to be a feasible wind farm controls approach.
Nonetheless, the effectiveness of yawing depends not only on the degree of wake
deflection but also on the resulting shape of the wake. In this work, the
deflection and morphology of wakes behind a wind turbine operating in yawed
conditions are studied using wind tunnel experiments of a wind turbine modeled
as a porous disk in a uniform inflow. First, by measuring velocity
distributions at various downstream positions and comparing with prior studies,
we confirm that the non-rotating wind turbine model in yaw generates realistic
wake deflections. Second, we characterize the wake shape and make first
observations of what is termed a curled wake, displaying significant spanwise
asymmetry. The wake curling observed in the experiments is also reproduced
qualitatively in large eddy simulations using both actuator disk and actuator
line models. When a wind turbine is yawed for the benefit of downstream
turbines, the asymmetric shape of the wake must be taken into account since it
affects how much of it intersects the downstream turbines.

Grioli (1940) discovered a geometric variational characterization of ${\rm

analyzed a generalization of Grioli's variational approach with weights
(material parameters) $\mu > 0$ and $\mu_c \geq 0$ (Grioli: $\mu = \mu_c$). The
energy subject to minimization coincides with the Cosserat shear-stretch
contribution arising in any geometrically nonlinear, isotropic and quadratic
Cosserat continuum model formulated in the deformation gradient field $F :=
\nabla\varphi: \Omega \to {\rm GL}^+(3)$ and the microrotation field $R: \Omega

Our goal is to motivate this mechanism by presenting it in a relevant setting.
To this end, we explicitly construct a deformation mapping $\varphi_{\rm nano}$
which models an idealized nanoindentation and compare the corresponding optimal
rotation patterns ${\rm rpolar}^\pm_{1,0}(F_{\rm nano})$ with experimentally
obtained 3D-EBSD measurements of the disorientation angle of lattice rotations
due to a nanoindentation in solid copper. We observe that the non-classical
relaxed-polar mechanism can produce interesting counter-rotations. A possible
link between Cosserat theory and finite multiplicative plasticity theory on
small scales is also explored.

measure in vivo but essential for a quantitative understanding of evolution.
Using whole genome deep sequencing data from longitudinal samples during
untreated HIV-1 infection, we estimated mutation rates and fitness costs in
HIV-1 from the temporal dynamics of genetic variation. At approximately neutral
sites, mutations accumulate with a rate of 1.2 x 10^-5 per site per day, in
agreement with the rate measured in cell cultures. The rate from G to A is
largest, followed by the other transitions C to T, T to C, and A to G, while
transversions are more rare. At non-neutral sites, most mutations reduce virus
replication; using a model of mutation selection balance, we estimated the
fitness cost of mutations at every site in the HIV-1 genome. About half of all
nonsynonymous mutations have large fitness costs (greater than 10\%), while
most synonymous mutations have costs below 1\%. The cost of synonymous
mutations is especially low in most of gag and pol, while much higher costs are
observed in important RNA structures and regulatory regions. The intrapatient
fitness cost estimates are consistent across multiple patients, suggesting that
the deleterious part of the fitness landscape is universal and explains a large
fraction of global HIV-1 group M diversity.

spatial resolution of 2 um. Only minor fluctuations are observed. No evidence
for strain, for a significant amount of disorder or lattice defects can be

systems. The advent of high sensitivity, high resolution imaging in the
submillimetre where both the solid and gas components of disks can be detected
opens up new possibilities for understanding the dynamical histories of these
systems and therefore, a better ability to place our own solar system, which
hosts a highly evolved debris disk, in context. Comparisons of dust masses from
protoplanetary and debris disks have revealed a stark downturn in mass in
millimetre-sized grains around a stellar age of 10 Myr, ostensibly in the
""transition disk"" phase, suggesting a period of rapid accretion of such grains
onto planetesimals. This rapid formation phase is in keeping with radionucleide
studies of Kuiper Belt Objects in the solar system. Importantly, this suggests
that any thermal gradients in the gas of disks of this era will be ""frozen in""
to the planetesimals as they rapidly accrete from the solids and ices in their
vicinity. Measurements of radial gradients in thermal tracers such as DHO, DCN
and other tracers can therefore provide insight into the nascent solar system's
abudances. In studies of dynamical evolution of the solar system, it is tacitly
assumed that such abundances can reveal the location of formation for bodies
now found in the asteroid belt and Kuiper belt. Similarly, evidence of gas
detected from collisional evolution in young debris disks could potentially
reveal how rapidly objects have dynamically evolved in those systems, most of
which will be significantly younger than the solar system.

identity in the slope and inhomogeneity of the ultraviolet ionizing background
(UVB): Bright quasars (QSOs) generate a hard UVB with predominantly large-scale
fluctuations while Population II stars generate a softer one with smaller-scale
fluctuations. Metal absorbers probe the UVB's slope because different ions are
sensitive to different energies. Likewise, they probe spatial fluctuations
because they originate in regions where a galaxy-driven UVB is harder and more
intense. We take a first step towards studying the reionization-epoch UVB's
slope and inhomogeneity by comparing observations of 12 metal absorbers at
$z\sim6$ versus predictions from a cosmological hydrodynamic simulation using
three different UVBs: a soft, spatially-inhomogeneous ""galaxies+QSOs"" UVB; a
homogeneous ""galaxies+QSOs"" UVB (Haardt & Madau 2012); and a QSOs-only model.
All UVBs reproduce the observed column density distributions of CII, SiIV, and
CIV reasonably well although high-column, high-ionization absorbers are
underproduced, reflecting numerical limitations. With upper limits treated as
detections, only a soft, fluctuating UVB reproduces both the observed SiIV/CIV
and CII/CIV distributions. The QSOs-only UVB overpredicts both CIV/CII and
CIV/SiIV, indicating that it is too hard. The Haardt & Madau (2012) UVB
underpredicts CIV/SiIV, suggesting that it lacks amplifications near galaxies.
Hence current observations prefer a soft, fluctuating UVB as expected from a
predominantly Population II background although they cannot rule out a harder
one. Future observations probing a factor of two deeper in metal column density
will distinguish between the soft, fluctuating and QSOs-only UVBs.

the phonon assisted TAT current always dominates and obscures the steep turn ON
of the BTBT current for common densities of traps. Our results are applicable
to top gate, double gate and gate all around structures where the traps are
positioned between the source-channel tunneling region. Since the TAT has
strong dependence on electric field, any effort to increase the BTBT current by
enhancing local electric field also increases the leakage current. Unless the
BTBT current can be increased separately, calculations show that the trap
density Dit has to be decreased by 40-100 times compared with the state of the

extremely strong nonlinearities and no explicit formulas of the primitive
variables and flux vectors with respect to the conservative vector, two
equivalent forms of $\mathcal G$ with explicit constraints on the conservative
vector are skillfully discovered. The first is derived by analyzing roots of
several polynomials and transferring successively them, and further used to
prove the convexity of $\mathcal G$ with the aid of semi-positive definiteness
of the second fundamental form of a hypersurface. While the second is derived
based on the convexity and then used to show the orthogonal invariance of
$\mathcal G$. The Lax-Friedrichs (LxF) splitting property does not hold
generally for nonzero magnetic field, but by a constructive inequality and
pivotal techniques, we discover the generalized LxF splitting properties,
combining the convex combination of some LxF splitting terms with a discrete
divergence-free condition of magnetic field. Based on above analyses, several
one- and two-dimensional PCP schemes are then studied. In 1D case, a
first-order accurate LxF type scheme is first proved to be PCP under the CFL
condition, and then high-order PCP schemes are proposed via a PCP limiter. In
2D case, the discrete divergence-free condition and PCP property are analyzed
for a first-order LxF scheme, and two sufficient conditions are derived for
high-order accurate PCP schemes. Our analysis reveals in theory for the first

PCP property. Several numerical examples demonstrate theoretical findings and

magnetic field extrapolation to create a model active region and apply the time
lag method to synthetic observations. Our aim is not to reproduce a particular
set of observations in detail, but to recover some typical properties and
patterns observed in active regions. Our key findings are the following. 1.
cooling dominates the time lag signature and the time lags between the channel
pairs are generally consistent with observed values. 2. shorter coronal loops
in the core cool more quickly than longer loops at the periphery. 3. all
channel pairs show zero time lag when the line-of-sight passes through coronal
loop foot-points. 4. there is strong evidence that plasma must be re-energized
on a time scale comparable to the cooling timescale to reproduce the observed
coronal activity, but it is likely that a relatively broad spectrum of heating
frequencies are operating across active regions. 5. due to their highly dynamic
nature, we find nanoflare trains produce zero time lags along entire flux tubes

velocity profiles of the objects located in the bound zones around massive
group-size halos at various redshifts and compare them to an analytic formula
characterized by two parameters, the amplitude and slope of the profile. The
best-fit values of the two parameters are found to be robust against the
changes of the mass scales and the key cosmological parameters. It is also
found that the amplitude and slope parameters of the bound-zone peculiar
velocity profile are constant but only in the limited ranges of redshifts. In
the dark matter dominated epoch corresponding to z> 0.6 the two parameters have
constant values. In the transition period corresponding to 0.2=< z=< 0.6 when
the density of Lambda begins to exceed that of dark matter the two parameters
grow almost linearly with redshifts. At later epochs z<0.2 when the
Lambda-domination prevails the two parameters regain constancy settling upon
higher constant values. Noting that the length of the transition period depends
on the amount of Lambda and speculating that the linear evolution of the

underlying layers of the atmosphere. The mechanism and location of energy
release, and the precise source of coronal plasma, remain unresolved. In
earlier work we pursued the idea that warm plasma is supplied to the corona via
direct heating of the chromosphere by nanoflares, contrary to the prevailing
belief that the corona is heated in-situ and the chromosphere is subsequently
energized and ablated by thermal conduction. We found that single
(low-frequency) chromospheric nanoflares could not explain the observed
intensities, Doppler-shifts, and red/blue asymmetries in Fe XII and XIV
emission lines. In the present work we follow up on another suggestion that the
corona could be powered by chromospheric nanoflares that repeat on a timescale
substantially shorter than the cooling/draining timescale. That is, a single
magnetic strand is re-supplied with coronal plasma before the existing plasma
has time to cool and drain. We perform a series of hydrodynamic experiments and
predict the Fe XII and XIV line intensities, Doppler-shifts, and red/blue
asymmetries. We find that our predicted quantities disagree dramatically with
observations and fully developed loop structures cannot be created by
intermediate- or high-frequency chromospheric nanoflares. We conclude that the
mechanism ultimately responsible for producing coronal plasma operates above
the chromosphere, but this does not preclude the possibility of a similar
mechanism powering the chromosphere; extreme examples of which may be
responsible for heating chromospheric plasma to transition region temperatures
(e.g. type II spicules).

smooth and accurate haptic feedback in complex scenarios. Smooth haptic
feedback is an important task for haptic rendering with complex virtual
objects. However, commonly the update rate of the haptic rendering may drop
down during multi-point contact in complex scenarios because high computational
cost is required for collision detection and physically-based dynamic
simulation. If the haptic rendering is done at a lower update rate, it may
cause discontinuous or instable force/torque feedback. Therefore, to implement
smooth and accurate haptic rendering, the update rate of force/torque
calculation should be kept in a high and constant frequency. In the proposed
method, the auto-regressive model with real-time coefficients update is
proposed to predict interactive forces/torques during the physical simulation.
In addition, we introduce a spline function to dynamically interpolate smooth
forces/torques in haptic display according to the update rate of physical
simulation. In the experiments, we show the feasibility of the proposed method
and compare its performance with other methods and algorithms. The result shows
that the proposed method can provide smooth and accurate haptic force feedback

ill-posed, combinatorial optimization problem. Here we propose an algorithm

second class, which is more constrained from the existing data, the SM Higgs

adequately capture the behaviour of the microscale system. We derive the
macroscale boundary conditions of the macroscale model for longitudinal wave
propagation on a lattice with periodically varying density and elasticity. We
model the macroscale dynamics of the microscale Dirichlet, Robin-like,

improves the accuracy of the macroscale models. The methodology developed here
can be adapted to a wide range of multiscale wave propagation problems.

monitoring the nearby blazar Mkn 421 for the past 7yrs.
  Aims: Blazars show flux variability in all timescales across the
electromagnetic spectrum. While there is abundant literature characterizing the
short term flares from different blazars, comparatively little work has been
done to study the long term variability. We aim to study the long term temporal
and spectral variability in the radiation from Mkn 421 during 2009-2015.
  Methods: We quantify the variability and lognormality from the radio to the
VHE bands, and compute the correlations between the various wavebands using the
z-transformed discrete correlation function. We construct the Spectral Energy
Distribution (SED) contemporaneous with HAGAR observation seasons and fit it
with a one zone synchrotron self Compton model to study the spectral
variability.
  Results: The flux is found to be highly variable across all time scales. The
variability is energy dependant, and is maximum in the X-ray and Very High
Energy (VHE) bands. A strong correlation is found between the Fermi-LAT (gamma)
and radio bands, and between Fermi-LAT and optical, but none between Fermi-LAT
and X-ray. Lognormality in the flux distribution is clearly detected. This is
the third blazar, following BL~Lac and PKS~2155$+$304 to show this behavior.
The SED can be well fit by a one zone SSC model, and variations in the flux
states can be attributed mainly due to changes in the particle distribution. A
strong correlation is seen between the break energy $\gamma_b$ of the particle
spectrum and the total bolometric luminosity.

a spin-flip tunnelling, which opens a gap in the spin-triplet channel near the

second order when the tunnelling exceeds a critical value. Considering a

the $p$-Laplacian. Concerning these functions, no multiple-angle formula has
been known except for the classical cases and a special case discovered by
Edmunds, Gurka and Lang, not to mention addition theorems. In this paper, we

processes (MDPs) concern infinite-time horizon specifications. The classical
aim in this context is to compute a control policy that maximizes the
probability of satisfying the specification. In many scenarios, there is
however a non-zero probability of failure in every step of the system's
execution. For infinite-time horizon specifications, this implies that the
specification is violated with probability 1 in the long run no matter what
policy is chosen, which prevents previous policy computation methods from being
useful in these scenarios.
  In this paper, we introduce a new optimization criterion for MDP policies
that captures the task of working towards the satisfaction of some
infinite-time horizon $\omega$-regular specification. The new criterion is
applicable to MDPs in which the violation of the specification cannot be
avoided in the long run. We give an algorithm to compute policies that are
optimal in this criterion and show that it captures the ideas of optimism and
risk-averseness in MDP control: while the computed policies are optimistic in
that a MDP run enters a failure state relatively late, they are risk-averse by
always maximizing the probability to reach their respective next goal state. We
give results on two robot control scenarios to validate the usability of
risk-averse MDP policies.

sequence of access points (APs) based on received signal strength (RSS). Unlike
existing indoor localization systems, our approach does not require any
time-consuming and laborious site survey phase to characterize the radio
signals in the environment. To be precise, we construct the fingerprint map by
cutting the layouts of the interested area into regions with only the knowledge
of positions of APs. This can be done offline within a second and has a
potential for practical use. The localization is then achieved by matching the
ordered AP-sequence to the ones in the fingerprint map. Different from
traditional fingerprinting that employing all APs information, we use only
selected APs to perform localization, due to the fact that, without site
survey, the possibility in obtaining the correct AP sequence is lower if it
involves more APs. Experimental results show that, the proposed system achieves
localization accuracy < 5m with an accumulative density function (CDF) of 50%
to 60% depending on the density of APs. Furthermore, we observe that, using all
APs for localization might not achieve the best localization accuracy, e.g. in
our case, 4 APs out of total 7 APs achieves the best performance. In practice,
the number of APs used to perform localization should be a design parameter
based on the placement of APs.

as materials for renewable energy technologies where hydrogen acts an energy
carrier, such as solid oxide fuel cells and hydrogen separation membranes.
While ionic transport in these materials has been investigated intensively, the
electronic counterpart has received much less attention and further exploration
in this field is required. Here, we use density functional theory (DFT) to
study hole polarons and their impact on hole conductivity in Y-doped BaZrO$_3$.
Three different approaches have been used to remedy the self-interaction error
of local and semi-local exchange-correlation functionals: DFT$+U$, pSIC-DFT and
hybrid functionals. Self-trapped holes are found to be energetically favorable
by about $-$0.1 eV and the presence of yttrium results in further
stabilization. Polaron migration is predicted to occur through intraoctahedral
transfer and polaron rotational processes, which are associated with adiabatic
barriers of about 0.1 eV. However, the rather small energies associated with
polaron formation and migration suggest that the hole becomes delocalized and
band-like at elevated temperatures. These results together with an endothermic
oxidation reaction [A. Lindman et al., Phys. Rev. B 91, 245114 (2015)] yield a
picture that is consistent with experimental data for the hole conductivity.
The results we present here provide new insight into hole transport in
acceptor-doped BaZrO$_3$ and similar materials, which will be of value in the
future development of sustainable technologies.

operation is the least conventional operator in SPARQL. So it becomes essential
to make a trade-off between the query response time and the accuracy of their

well-designed patterns since the OPT operation in a well-designed pattern is
really ""optional"". Firstly, we transform a well-designed pattern in OPT normal
form into a well-designed tree, whose inner nodes are labeled by OPT operation
and leaf nodes are labeled by patterns containing other operations such as the
AND operation and the FILTER operation. Secondly, based on this well-designed
tree, we remove ""optional"" well-designed subtrees with less depth of the OPT

pulsation-induced shock waves and radiation pressure on dust. In dynamic
atmosphere and wind models, the stellar pulsation is often simulated by
prescribing a simple sinusoidal variation in velocity and luminosity at the
inner boundary of the model atmosphere. We experiment with different forms of
the luminosity variation in order to assess the effects on the wind velocity
and mass-loss rate, when progressing from the simple sinusoidal recipe towards
more realistic descriptions. Using state-of-the-art dynamical models of C-rich
AGB stars, a range of different asymmetric shapes of the luminosity variation
and a range of phase shifts of the luminosity variation relative to the radial
variation are tested. These tests are performed on two stellar atmosphere
models. The first model has dust condensation and, as a consequence, a stellar
wind is triggered, while the second model lacks both dust and wind. The first
model with dust and stellar wind is very sensitive to moderate changes in the
luminosity variation. There is a complex relationship between the luminosity
minimum, and dust condensation: changing the phase corresponding to minimum
luminosity can either increase or decrease mass-loss rate and wind velocity.
The luminosity maximum dominates the radiative pressure on the dust, which in
turn, is important for driving the wind. These effects of changed luminosity
variation are coupled with the dust formation. In contrast there is very little
change to the structure of the model without dust. Changing the luminosity
variation, both by introducing a phase shift and by modifying the shape,
influences wind velocity and the mass-loss rate. To improve wind models it
would probably be desirable to extract boundary conditions from 3D dynamical
interior models or stellar pulsation models.

Accepted for publication to MNRAS main journal",,"10.1093/mnras/stw1966",,"astro-ph.HE","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The escape of cosmic rays from the Galaxy leads to a gradient in the cosmic
ray pressure that acts as a force on the background plasma, in the direction
opposite to the gravitational pull. If this force is large enough to win
against gravity, a wind can be launched that removes gas from the Galaxy,
thereby regulating several physical processes, including star formation. The
dynamics of these cosmic ray driven winds is intrinsically non-linear in that
the spectrum of cosmic rays determines the characteristics of the wind
(velocity, pressure, magnetic field) and in turn the wind dynamics affects the
cosmic ray spectrum. Moreover, the gradient of the cosmic ray distribution
function causes excitation of Alfven waves, that in turn determine the
scattering properties of cosmic rays, namely their diffusive transport. These
effects all feed into each other so that what we see at the Earth is the result
of these non-linear effects. Here we investigate the launch and evolution of
such winds, and we determine the implications for the spectrum of cosmic rays
by solving together the hydrodynamical equations for the wind and the transport
equation for cosmic rays under the action of self-generated diffusion and
advection with the wind and the self-excited Alfven waves.

applying shared convolution across the spatial dimension in some computational

to predict weak-lensing (WL) peak counts, which have been shown to be a very
valuable non-Gaussian probe of cosmology. In this paper, we compare the
cosmological information extracted from WL peak counts using different
filtering techniques of the galaxy shear data, including linear filtering with
a Gaussian and two compensated filters (the starlet wavelet and the aperture
mass), and the nonlinear filtering method MRLens. We present improvements to
our model that account for realistic survey conditions, which are masks,
shear-to-convergence transformations, and non-constant noise. We create
simulated peak counts from our stochastic model, from which we obtain
constraints on the matter density $\Omega_\mathrm{m}$, the power spectrum
normalisation $\sigma_8$, and the dark-energy parameter $w_0$. We use two
methods for parameter inference, a copula likelihood, and approximate Bayesian
computation (ABC). We measure the contour width in the
$\Omega_\mathrm{m}$-$\sigma_8$ degeneracy direction and the figure of merit to
compare parameter constraints from different filtering techniques. We find that
starlet filtering outperforms the Gaussian kernel, and that including peak
counts from different smoothing scales helps to lift parameter degeneracies.
Peak counts from different smoothing scales with a compensated filter show very
little cross-correlation, and adding information from different scales can
therefore strongly enhance the available information. Measuring peak counts
separately from different scales yields tighter constraints than using a
combined peak histogram from a single map that includes multiscale information.
Our results suggest that a compensated filter function with counts included
separately from different smoothing scales yields the tightest constraints on
cosmological parameters from WL peaks.

Lipschitz condition is replaced by an appropriate one-sided Lipschitz condition
(sometimes called monotonicity condition) and the number of driving Brownian
motions is finite, then existence and uniqueness of global solutions for each

slightly stronger one-sided Lipschitz condition the solutions still generate a
stochastic semiflow which is jointly continuous in all variables (but which is

$\Delta$-completeness which means that there exists a modification of the
solution which if restricted to any set of dimension $\Delta$ is almost surely
continuous with respect to the initial condition.

$\gamma$-rays with MAGIC in 2007. The absence of simultaneous data at lower
energies led to a rather incomplete characterization of the broadband spectral
energy distribution (SED). We study the source properties and the emission
mechanisms, probing whether a simple one-zone synchrotron-self-Compton (SSC)
scenario is able to explain the observed broadband spectrum. We analyzed VHE to
radio data from 2011 and 2012 collected by MAGIC, $Fermi$-LAT, $Swift$, KVA,
OVRO, and Mets\""ahovi in addition to optical polarimetry data and radio maps
from the Liverpool Telescope and MOJAVE. The VHE spectrum was fit with a simple
power law with a photon index of $3.69\pm0.22$ and a flux above 150 GeV of
$(1.46\pm0.16)\times10^{-11}$ ph cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$. 1ES 1011+496 was found to
be in a generally quiescent state at all observed wavelengths, showing only
moderate variability from radio to X-rays. A low degree of polarization of less
than 10% was measured in optical, while some bright features polarized up to
60% were observed in the radio jet. A similar trend in the rotation of the
electric vector position angle was found in optical and radio. The radio maps
indicated a superluminal motion of $1.8\pm0.4\,c$, which is the highest speed
statistically significantly measured so far in a high-frequency-peaked BL Lac.
For the first time, the high-energy bump in the broadband SED of 1ES 1011+496
could be fully characterized from 0.1 GeV to 1 TeV which permitted a more
reliable interpretation within the one-zone SSC scenario. The polarimetry data
suggest that at least part of the optical emission has its origin in some of
the bright radio features, while the low polarization in optical might be due
to the contribution of parts of the radio jet with different orientations of
the magnetic field to the optical emission.

expected that the warped heliospheric current sheet forms a region of

the ion-kinetic tearing instability, and hence generate magnetic islands and
hot populations of ions associated with magnetic reconnection. Reconnection
processes in this environment have important implications for local particle
transport, and for particle acceleration at reconnection sites and in
turbulence. We study this complex environment by means of three-dimensional

from linear growth of the tearing instability to a fully developed turbulent
state at late times. The final state develops from the highly ordered initial
state via both forward and inverse cascades. Component and spectral anisotropy
in the magnetic fluctuations is present when a guide field is included. The
inclusion of a population of new-born interstellar pickup protons does not

The chosen instrument configuration using the G140L grating covers the spectral

method to account for temporal and spatial background variations of the
detector, which is crucial at the low flux levels around 912 A. This modified

emission in Tol 0440-381 as an upper limit due to possible contamination by
geocoronal Lyman series lines. We determined the current star-formation
properties from the far-ultraviolet continuum and spectral lines and used
synthesis models to predict the Lyman continuum radiation emitted by the

in the Shanghai Bund. Due to the innately stochastic and complicated individual
movement, it is not easy to predict collective gatherings, which potentially
leads to crowd events. In this paper, with leveraging the big data generated on
Baidu map, we propose a novel approach to early warning such potential crowd
disasters, which has profound public benefits. An insightful observation is
that, with the prevalence and convenience of mobile map service, users usually
search on the Baidu map to plan a routine. Therefore, aggregating users' query
data on Baidu map can obtain priori and indication information for estimating
future human population in a specific area ahead of time. Our careful analysis
and deep investigation on the Baidu map data on various events also
demonstrates a strong correlation pattern between the number of map query and
the number of positioning users in an area. Based on such observation, we
propose a decision method utilizing query data on Baidu map to invoke warnings
for potential crowd events about 1-3 hours in advance. Then we also construct a
machine learning model with heterogeneous data (such as query data and mobile
positioning data) to quantitatively measure the risk of the potential crowd

compute the stochastic gradient component associated with a randomly chosen
block. The technical contribution of this paper is to show that this minimally
coordinated algorithm converges to the optimal classifier when the training
objective is convex. In particular, we show that: (i) When using decreasing
stepsizes, RAPSA converges almost surely over the random choice of blocks and
functions. (ii) When using constant stepsizes, convergence is to a neighborhood
of optimality with a rate that is linear in expectation. RAPSA is numerically

criterion for the validity of the Fermi-golden-rule description. Technically,
we implement the real-space Keldysh diagram technique, handling correlations in
the quasi-discrete spectrum non-perturbatively by means of the non-linear
supersymmetric sigma model. The unitary symmetry class is considered for
simplicity. Our approach is complementary to the lattice-model analysis of Fock

the exact lowest-order expression for mesoscopic fluctuations of the relaxation
rate, making no assumptions on the matrix elements of the interaction. It is
shown that for the quasiparticle with the energy $\varepsilon$ on top of the

continue earlier work exploring UV completions for these models, including the
key (though often ignored) issue of modulus stabilisation, to assess the
robustness of their predictions. We show that string models where the inflaton
is a fibration modulus seem to be robust due to an effective rescaling
symmetry, and fairly generic since most known Calabi-Yau manifolds are
fibrations. This class of models is characterized by a generic relation between
the tensor-to-scalar ratio $r$ and the spectral index $n_s$ of the form $r
\propto (n_s -1)^2$ where the proportionality constant depends on the nature of
the effects used to develop the inflationary potential and the topology of the
internal space. In particular we find that the largest values of the
tensor-to-scalar ratio that can be obtained by generalizing the original set-up
are of order $r \lesssim 0.01$. We contrast this general picture with specific
popular models, such as the Starobinsky scenario and $\alpha$-attractors.

a complex system into a simpler representation from which to investigate brain
organisation. Recent advancement in the neuroimaging field are towards
representing brain connectivity as a dynamic process in order to gain a deeper
understanding of how the brain is organised for information transport. In this
paper we propose a network modelling approach based on the heat kernel to
capture the process of heat diffusion in complex networks. By applying the heat
kernel to structural brain networks, we define new features which quantify
change in energy flow. Identifying suitable features which can classify
networks between cohorts is useful towards understanding the effect of disease
on brain architecture. We demonstrate the discriminative power of heat kernel
features in both synthetic and clinical preterm data. By generating an
extensive range of synthetic networks with varying density and randomisation,
we investigate how heat flows in the networks in relation to changes in network
topology. We demonstrate that our proposed features provide a metric of network
efficiency and may be indicative of organisational principles commonly
associated with, for example, small-world architecture. In addition, we show
the potential of these features to characterise and classify between network
topologies. We further demonstrate our methodology in a clinical setting by
applying it to a large cohort of preterm babies scanned at term equivalent age
from which diffusion networks were computed. We show that our heat kernel

out in the light-cone formalism, combined with nonrelativistic QCD

accelerated through the use of Pade approximants, to deal with divergences in

promising tools that aim to study the epoch of reionization and beyond via

annihilations into charged particles change the thermal history of the Universe
and, as a consequence, affect the 21 cm signal. Accurately predicting the
effect of DM strongly relies on the modeling of annihilations inside halos. In
this work, we use up-to-date computations of the energy deposition rates by the
products from DM annihilations, a proper treatment of the contribution from DM
annihilations in halos, as well as values of the annihilation cross section
allowed by the most recent cosmological measurements from the Planck satellite.
Given current uncertainties on the description of the astrophysical processes
driving the epochs of reionization, X-ray heating and Lyman-$\alpha$ pumping,
we find that disentangling DM signatures from purely astrophysical effects,
related to early-time star formation processes or late-time galaxy X-ray
emissions, will be a challenging task. We conclude that only annihilations of
DM particles with masses of $\sim100$ MeV, could leave an unambiguous imprint
on the 21 cm signal and, in particular, on the 21 cm power spectrum. This is in
contrast to previous, more optimistic results in the literature, which have
claimed that strong signatures might also be present even for much higher DM
masses. Additional measurements of the 21 cm signal at different cosmic epochs
will be crucial in order to break the strong parameter degeneracies between DM
annihilations and astrophysical effects and undoubtedly single out a DM imprint
for masses different from $\sim100$ MeV.

information theoretic model of noisy computation of a perfect function f
(measurable function between sequence spaces) thanks to an unreliable device
(random channel) F is given: a noisy computation is a product fxF of channels.
A model of reliable computation based on input encoding and output decoding is
also proposed. These models extend those of noisy communication channel and of
reliable communication through a noisy channel. The capacity of a noisy
computation is defined and justified by a coding theorem and a converse. Under
some constraints on the encoding process, capacity is the upper bound of input
rates allowing reliable computation, i.e. decodability of noisy outputs into
expected outputs. These results hold when the one-sided random processes under
concern are asymptotic mean stationary (AMS) and ergodic. In addition, some
characterizations of AMS and ergodic noisy computations are given based on
stability properties of the perfect function f and of the random channel F.
These results are derived from the more general framework of channel products.
Finally, a way to apply the noisy and reliable computation models to cases
where the perfect function f is defined according to a formal computational
model is proposed.

used to find the feature cluster configuration which best explains the
structure in the correlation matrix. We conjecture that this feature
configuration is a candidate descriptor for the temporal state of the system.
Using a simple cluster configuration similarity metric, we are able to
enumerate the state space based on prevailing feature configurations. The
proposed state representation removes the need for human-driven data
pre-processing for state attribute specification, allowing a learning agent to
find structure in streaming data, discern changes in the system, enumerate its
perceived state space and learn suitable action-selection policies.

sources, background stars, ...) is an essential task in astronomy. Typically,
one of the classes corresponds to extragalactic radiation, whose photon
emission behaviour is well characterized by a homogeneous Poisson process. We
propose to use normalized versions of the Wasserstein and Zolotarev distances
to quantify the deviation of the distribution of photon interarrival times from
the exponential class. Our main motivation is the analysis of a massive dataset
from X-ray astronomy obtained by the Chandra Orion Ultradeep Project (COUP).
This project yielded a large catalog of 1616 X-ray cosmic sources in the Orion
Nebula region, with their series of photon arrival times and associated
energies. We consider the plug-in estimators of these metrics, determine their
asymptotic distributions, and illustrate their finite-sample performance with a
Monte Carlo study. We estimate these metrics for each COUP source from three
different classes. We conclude that our proposal provides a striking amount of
information on the nature of the photon emitting sources. Further, these
variables have the ability to identify X-ray sources wrongly catalogued before.
As an appealing conclusion, we show that some sources, previously classified as
extragalactic emissions, have a much higher probability of being young stars in
Orion Nebula.

the broadcast operation, plays an integral part in high performance computing
applications. MPICH, as one of the contemporary widely-used MPI software
stacks, implements the broadcast operation based on point-to-point operation.
Depending on the parameters, such as message size and process count, the
library chooses to use different algorithms, as for instance binomial
dissemination, recursive-doubling exchange or ring all-to-all broadcast
(allgather). However, the existing broadcast design in latest release of MPICH
does not provide good performance for large messages (\textit{lmsg}) or medium
messages with non-power-of-two process counts (\textit{mmsg-npof2}) due to the
inner suboptimal ring allgather algorithm. In this paper, based on the native
broadcast design in MPICH, we propose a tuned broadcast approach with
bandwidth-saving in mind catering to the case of \textit{lmsg} and
\textit{mmsg-npof2}. Several comparisons of the native and tuned broadcast

charge density wave (axionic CDW) state. While it has been shown that the
topological response (anomalous Hall conductivity) is protected against the CDW
state, we find that the long wavelength plasmon excitation is radically
influenced by the dynamics of the CDW order parameter. In the normal state, we
show that an undamped collective mode should exist at q~Q_(CDW) if there is an
attractive interaction favoring the formation of the CDW state. The undamped
nature of this collective mode is attributed to a gap-like feature in the
particle-hole continuum at q~Q_(CDW) due to the chirality of the Weyl nodes,
which is not seen in other materials with CDW instability. In the CDW state,
the long wavelength plasmon excitations become more dispersive due to the
additional interband scattering not allowed in the normal state. Moreover,
because the translational symmetry is spontaneously broken, Umklapp scattering,
the process conserving the total momentum only up to nQ_(CDW) with n an integer
and Q_(CDW) the ordering wave vector, emerges in the CDW state. We find that
the plasmon excitation couples to the phonon mode of the CDW order via the
Umklapp scattering, leading to two branches of resonant collective modes
observable in the density-density correlation function at q~0 and q~Q_(CDW).
Based on our analysis, we propose that measuring these resonant plasmon-axion
excitations around q~0 and q~Q_(CDW) by the momentum-resolved electron energy
loss spectroscopy (M-EELS) could serve as a reliable way to detect the axionic
CDW state in Weyl semimetals.

block in various tasks. Naturally, the patch-size has a major impact on the
matching quality, and on the consequent application performance. Under the
assumption that our patch database is sufficiently sampled, using large patches
(e.g. 21-by-21) should be preferred over small ones (e.g. 7-by-7). However,
this ""dense-sampling"" assumption is rarely true; in most cases large patches
cannot find relevant nearby examples. This phenomenon is a consequence of the
curse of dimensionality, stating that the database-size should grow
exponentially with the patch-size to ensure proper matches. This explains the
favored choice of small patch-size in most applications.
  Is there a way to keep the simplicity and work with small patches while
getting some of the benefits that large patches provide? In this work we offer
such an approach. We propose to concatenate the regular content of a
conventional (small) patch with a compact representation of its (large)
surroundings - its context. Therefore, with a minor increase of the dimensions
(e.g. with additional 10 values to the patch representation), we
implicitly/softly describe the information of a large patch. The additional
descriptors are computed based on a self-similarity behavior of the patch
surrounding.
  We show that this approach achieves better matches, compared to the use of
conventional-size patches, without the need to increase the database-size.
Also, the effectiveness of the proposed method is tested on three distinct
problems: (i) External natural image denoising, (ii) Depth image
super-resolution, and (iii) Motion-compensated frame-rate up-conversion.

power to considerably improve our understanding of the physics of inflation.
Indeed, if we can increase the precision of current measurements by an order of
magnitude, a null-detection would rule out many classes of scenarios for
generating primordial fluctuations. Large-scale galaxy redshift surveys
represent experiments that hold the promise to realise this goal. Thus, we
model the galaxy bispectrum and forecast the accuracy with which it will probe
the parameter $f_{\rm NL}$, which represents the degree of primordial
local-type non Gaussianity. Specifically, we address the problem of modelling
redshift space distortions (RSD) in the tree-level galaxy bispectrum including
$f_{\rm NL}$. We find novel contributions associated with RSD, with the
characteristic large scale amplification induced by local-type non-Gaussianity.
These RSD effects must be properly accounted for in order to obtain un-biased
measurements of $f_{\rm NL}$ from the galaxy bispectrum. We propose an analytic
template for the monopole which can be used to fit against data on large
scales, extending models used in the recent measurements. Finally, we perform
idealised forecasts on $\sigma_{f_{\rm NL}}$ -- the accuracy of the
determination of local non-linear parameter $f_{\rm NL}$ -- from measurements
of the galaxy bispectrum. Our findings suggest that current surveys can in
principle provide $f_{\rm NL}$ constraints competitive with Planck, and future
surveys could improve them further.

out in non-Hermitian quantum mechanics, where complex potentials obeying $\cal

optics, Bose-Einstein condensates, electronic circuits, and many other physical
fields, where a judicious balancing of gain and loss constitutes a $\cal
PT$-symmetric system. The natural inclusion of nonlinearity into these $\cal
PT$ systems then gave rise to a wide array of new phenomena which have no
counterparts in traditional dissipative systems. Examples include the existence
of continuous families of nonlinear modes and integrals of motion,
stabilization of nonlinear modes above $\cal PT$-symmetry phase transition,
symmetry breaking of nonlinear modes, distinctive soliton dynamics, and many
others. In this article, nonlinear $\cal PT$-symmetric systems arising from
various physical disciplines are presented; nonlinear properties of these
systems are thoroughly elucidated; and relevant experimental results are
described. In addition, emerging applications of $\cal PT$ symmetry are pointed
out.

ellipsoidal fluid masses, which are the simplest global models of rotationally

planet may be unstable to the elliptical instability, a hydrodynamic
instability that can drive tidal evolution. We perform a global (and local WKB)
analysis to study this instability using the elegant formalism of Lebovitz &
Lifschitz. We survey the parameter space of global instabilities with harmonic
orders $\ell\leq 5$, for planets with spins that are purely aligned (prograde)
or anti-aligned (retrograde) with their orbits. In general, the instability has
a much larger growth rate if the planetary spin and orbit are anti-aligned
rather than aligned. We have identified a violent instability for anti-aligned
spins outside of the usual frequency range for the elliptical instability (when
$\frac{n}{\Omega}\lesssim -1$, where $n$ and $\Omega$ are the orbital and spin
angular frequencies, respectively) if the tidal amplitude is sufficiently
large. We also explore the instability in a rigid ellipsoidal container, which
is found to be quantitatively similar to that with a realistic free surface.
Finally, we study the effect of rotation and tidal deformation on mode
frequencies. We find that larger rotation rates and larger tidal deformations
both decrease the frequencies of the prograde sectoral surface gravity modes.
This increases the prospect of their tidal excitation, potentially enhancing
the tidal response over expectations from linear theory. In a companion paper,
we use our results to interpret global simulations of the elliptical

spin-orbit aligned or anti-aligned, and non-synchronously rotating, tidally
deformed, homogeneous fluid body. A companion paper presented an analysis of
the global modes and instabilities of such a planet. Here I focus on the
nonlinear evolution of the elliptical instability. This is observed to produce
bursts of turbulence that drive the planet towards synchronism with its orbit
in an erratic manner. If the planetary spin is initially anti-aligned, the
elliptical instability also drives spin-orbit alignment on a similar timescale
as the spin synchronisation. The instability generates differential rotation
inside the planet in the form of zonal flows, which play an important role in
the saturation of the instability, and in producing the observed burstiness.
These results are broadly consistent with the picture obtained using a local
Cartesian model (where columnar vortices played the role of zonal flows). I
also simulate the instability in a container that is rigid (but stress-free)
rather than free, finding broad quantitative agreement. The dissipation
resulting from the elliptical instability could explain why the shortest-period
hot Jupiters tend to have circular orbits inside about 2-3 days, and predicts
spin-synchronisation (and spin-orbit alignment) out to about 10-15 days.
However, other mechanisms must be invoked to explain tidal circularisation for

polynomials is calculated. A set of infinite sums over products of two Laguerre
2D polynomials as intermediate step to the generating function for products of
Laguerre 2D polynomials is evaluated but these sums possess also proper
importance for calculations with Laguerre polynomials. With the technique of
SU(1; 1) operator disentanglement some operator identities are derived in an
appendix. They allow to calculate convolutions of Gaussian functions combined
with polynomials in one- and two-dimensional case and are applied to evaluate
the discussed generating functions. Keywords: Laguerre and Hermite polynomials,
Laguerre 2D polynomials, Jacobi polynomials, Mehler formula, SU(1; 1) operator
disentanglement, Gaussian convolutions.

Such SVM classifier provides the high quality of data classification. The idea
of particles' {\guillemotleft}regeneration{\guillemotright} is put on the basis
of the modified particle swarm optimization algorithm. At the realization of
this idea, some particles change their kernel function type to the one which
corresponds to the particle with the best value of the classification accuracy.
The offered particle swarm optimization algorithm allows reducing the time

model building and estimation of cosmological parameters from various field
theoretic setup, quantification of reheating temperature, studies of
leptogenesis in braneworld and estimation of primordial non-Gaussianity from
${\cal N}=1$ supergravity using $\delta N$ formalism. We start our discussion
with exploring the possibility of MSSM inflation in the light of recent
observed data from various D -flat directions using the saddle and inflection
point techniques. The effective inflaton potential around saddle point and
inflection point have been utilized in estimating the observable parameters and
confronting them with WMAP7 and Planck dataset. Next we explore the possibility
of inflation from the five dimensional ${\cal N} = 2$ supergravity setup by
deriving the effective potential in the context of RS like braneworld model and
DBI Galileon. After deriving an four dimensional effective potential, we obtain
the inflationary observables from both the scenarios and confront them with the
WMAP data. Further we fit the CMB angular power spectra from TT anisotropy and
other polarization data obtained from WMAP. Further, we discuss the non-trivial
features of reheating from supergravity inspired braneworld model, where the
results are to some extent different from that of the usual low energy GR
counterpart, because of the modified Friedmann equations in this setup. We
explicitly derive the analytical expressions for the reheating temperature and
further solve the evolution equation of the number density of thermal gravitino
which results in the gravitino abundance. Finally, we study the primordial
local type of non-Gaussian features using $\delta N$ formalism for a generic
class of sub-Planckian models dominated by the Hubble-induced corrections
within ${\cal N} = 1$ supergravity framework.

adaptive networks where the individual agents are allowed to move in pursuit of
an objective (target). The well-known Adapt-then-Combine (ATC) algorithm is
already available in the literature as a useful distributed diffusion-based
adaptive learning network. However, in the ATC diffusion algorithm, fixed step
sizes are used in the update equations for velocity vectors and location
vectors. When the nodes are too far away from the target, such strategies may
require large number of iterations to reach the target. To address this issue,
in this paper we suggest two modifications on the ATC mobile adaptive network
to improve its performance. The proposed modifications include (i)
distance-based variable step size adjustment at diffusion algorithms to update
velocity vectors and location vectors (ii) to use a selective cooperation, by
choosing the best nodes at each iteration to reduce the number of
communications. The performance of the proposed algorithm is evaluated by
simulation tests where the obtained results show the superior performance of
the proposed algorithm in comparison with the available ATC mobile adaptive
network.

structural models, and uses them to estimate its probability density
distribution for quality assessment. Qprob has been blindly tested on the 11th
Critical Assessment of Techniques for Protein Structure Prediction (CASP11) as
MULTICOM-NOVEL server. The official CASP result shows that Qprob ranks as one
of the top single-model QA methods. In addition, Qprob makes contributions to
our protein tertiary structure predictor MULTICOM, which is officially ranked
3rd out of 143 predictors. The good performance shows that Qprob is good at
assessing the quality of models of hard targets. These results demonstrate that
this new probability density distribution based method is effective for protein
single-model quality assessment and is useful for protein structure prediction.
