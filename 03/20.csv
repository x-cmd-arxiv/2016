simulations of solar convection, U, may be systematically over-estimated.
Motivated by these recent results, we explore the factors that determine U and
we consider how these might scale to solar parameter regimes. To this end, we
decrease the thermal diffusivity $\kappa$ along two paths in parameter space.
If the kinematic viscosity $\nu$ is decreased proportionally with $\kappa$
(fixing the Prandtl number $P_r = \nu/\kappa$), we find that U increases but
asymptotes toward a constant value, as found by Featherstone & Hindman (2016).
However, if $\nu$ is held fixed while decreasing $\kappa$ (increasing $P_r$),
we find that U systematically decreases. We attribute this to an enhancement of
the thermal content of downflow plumes, which allows them to carry the solar
luminosity with slower flow speeds. We contrast this with the case of
Rayleigh-Benard convection which is not subject to this luminosity constraint.
This dramatic difference in behavior for the two paths in parameter space
(fixed $P_r$ or fixed $\nu$) persists whether the heat transport by unresolved,
near-surface convection is modeled as a thermal conduction or as a fixed flux.
The results suggest that if solar convection can operate in a high-$P_r$
regime, then this might effectively limit the velocity amplitude. Small-scale
magnetism is a possible source of enhanced viscosity that may serve to achieve
this high-$P_r$ regime.

is inevitable, which could create some problems, such as degrading the
performance of quantum operations and the fidelity of various quantum states.
The focus of this work is to propose a crosstalk-insensitive method for
simultaneously coupling multiple pairs of resonators, which is important in
large-scale quantum information processing and communication in a network
consisting of resonators or cavities. In this work, we consider 2N resonators
of different frequencies, which are coupled to a three-level quantum system
(qutrit). By applying a strong pulse to the coupler qutrit, we show that an
effective Hamiltonian can be constructed for simultaneously coupling multiple
pairs of resonators.~The main advantage of this proposal is that the effect of
inter-resonator crosstalks is greatly suppressed by using resonators of
different frequencies. In addition, by employing the qutrit-resonator
dispersive interaction, the intermediate higher-energy level of the qutrit is
virtually excited and thus decoherence from this level is suppressed. This
effective Hamiltonian can be applied to implement quantum operations with
photonic qubits distributed in different resonators. As one application of this
Hamiltonian, we show how to simultaneously generate multiple EPR pairs of
photonic qubits distributed in 2N resonators. Numerical simulations show that
it is feasible to prepare two high-fidelity EPR photonic pairs using a setup of
four one-dimensional transmission line resonators coupled to a superconducting
flux qutrit with current circuit QED technology.

natural variant of random walks on graphs that can model the spread of disease
through contacts or the spread of information in networks. In a $k$-cobra walk,
at each time step a subset of the vertices are active; each active vertex
chooses $k$ random neighbors (sampled independently and uniformly with
replacement) that become active at the next step, and these are the only active
vertices at the next step. A natural quantity to study for cobra walks is the
cover time, which corresponds to the expected time when all nodes have become
infected or received the disseminated information.
  In this work, we extend previous results for cobra walks in multiple ways. We
show that the cover time for the 2-cobra walk on $[0,n]^d$ is $O(n)$ (where the
order notation hides constant factors that depend on $d$); previous work had
shown the cover time was $O(n \cdot polylog(n))$. We show that the cover time
for a 2-cobra walk on an $n$-vertex $d$-regular graph with conductance $\phi_G$
is $O(\phi_G^{-2} \log^2 n)$, significantly generalizing a previous result that
held only for expander graphs with sufficiently high expansion. And finally we
show that the cover time for a 2-cobra walk on a graph with $n$ vertices is
always $O(n^{11/4} \log n)$; this is the first result showing that the bound of
$\Theta(n^3)$ for the worst-case cover time for random walks can be beaten
using 2-cobra walks.

opposite direction to the project present in orthodox contemporary philosophy
of physics which attempts to ""bridge the gap"" between the quantum formalism and
common sense ""classical reality"" --precluding, right from the start, the
possibility of interpreting quantum superpositions through non-classical
notions. We will argue that in order to restate the problem of interpretation
of quantum mechanics in truly ontological terms we require a radical revision
of the problems and definitions addressed within the orthodox literature. On
the one hand, we will discuss the need of providing a formal redefinition of
superpositions which captures explicitly their contextual character. On the
other hand, we will attempt to replace the focus on the measurement problem,
which concentrates on the justification of measurement outcomes from ""weird""
superposed states, and introduce the superposition problem which focuses
instead on the conceptual representation of superpositions themselves. In this
respect, after presenting three necessary conditions for objective physical
representation, we will provide arguments which show why the classical
(actualist) representation of physics faces severe difficulties to solve the
superposition problem. Finally, we will also argue that, if we are willing to
abandon the (metaphysical) presupposition according to which 'Actuality =
Reality', then there is plenty of room to construct a conceptual representation
for quantum superpositions.

  Cryptogenography Problem",,,,,"cs.CR cs.DM","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The cryptogenography problem, introduced by Brody, Jakobsen, Scheder, and
Winkler (ITCS 2014), is to collaboratively leak a piece of information known to
only one member of a group (i)~without revealing who was the origin of this
information and (ii)~without any private communication, neither during the
process nor before. Despite several deep structural results, even the smallest
case of leaking one bit of information present at one of two players is not
well understood. Brody et al.\ gave a 2-round protocol enabling the two players
to succeed with probability $1/3$ and showed the hardness result that no
protocol can give a success probability of more than~$3/8$.
  In this work, we show that neither bound is tight. Our new hardness result,
obtained by a different application of the concavity method used also in the
previous work, states that a success probability better than 0.3672 is not
possible. Using both theoretical and numerical approaches, we improve the lower
bound to $0.3384$, that is, give a protocol leading to this success
probability. To ease the design of new protocols, we prove an equivalent
formulation of the cryptogenography problem as solitaire vector splitting game.
Via an automated game tree search, we find good strategies for this game. We
then translate the splits that occurred in this strategy into inequalities
relating position values and use an LP solver to find an optimal solution for
these inequalities. This gives slightly better game values, but more
importantly, it gives a more compact representation of the protocol and a way
to easily verify the claimed quality of the protocol.
  These improved bounds, as well as the large sizes and depths of the improved
protocols we find, suggests that finding good protocols for the
cryptogenography problem as well as understanding their structure are harder
than what the simple problem formulation suggests.

attention for the fact that human behavior in this social dilemma is often
inconsistent with the predictions of classic game theory. In the framework of
classic game theory, any common effort level is a strict and trembling hand
perfect Nash equilibrium, so that no desideratum is provided for selecting
among them. Behavior experiments, however, show that the effort levels employed
by subjects are inversely related to the effort costs. Here, we combine
coalescence theory and evolutionary game theory to investigate this game in
finite populations. Both analytic results and individual-based simulations show
that effort costs play a key role in the evolution of contribution levels,
which is in good agreement with those observed experimentally. Besides
well-mixed populations, set structured populations, where the population
structure itself is a consequence of the evolutionary process, have also been
taken into consideration. Therein we find that large number of sets and
moderate migration rate greatly promote effort levels, especially for high
effort costs. Our results may provide theoretical explanations for coordination
behaviors observed in real life from an evolutionary perspective.

induced by the reduction of the coupling by the dielectric membrane. In strong
salt solutions where the repulsive image-charge effects dominate the attractive
trans-cis coupling, the DNA molecule encounters a translocation barrier of ~10
kBT. In dilute electrolytes, the trans-cis coupling takes over image-charge

translocating polymers over long time intervals. This mechanism can be used in
translocation experiments in order to control the DNA motion by tuning the salt
concentration of the solution.

distribute a source rate budget among a set of (in)dependently coded data units

approaches convert the lone rate constraint to a linear rate penalty scaled by
a multiplier in the objective, resulting in a simpler unconstrained
formulation. However, the search for the ""optimal"" multiplier, one that results
in a distortion-minimizing solution among all Lagrangian solutions that satisfy
the original rate constraint, remains an elusive open problem in the general
setting. To address this problem, we propose a computation-efficient search
strategy to identify this optimal multiplier numerically. Specifically, we
first formulate a general rate allocation problem where each data unit can be
dependently coded at different quantization parameters (QP) using a previous
unit as predictor, or left uncoded at the encoder and subsequently interpolated
at the decoder using neighboring coded units. After converting the original
rate constrained problem to the unconstrained Lagrangian counterpart, we design
an efficient dynamic programming (DP) algorithm that finds the optimal
Lagrangian solution for a fixed multiplier. Finally, within the DP framework,
we iteratively compute neighboring singular multiplier values, each resulting
in multiple simultaneously optimal Lagrangian solutions, to drive the rates of
the computed Lagrangian solutions towards the bit budget. We terminate when a
singular multiplier value results in two Lagrangian solutions with rates below
and above the bit budget. In extensive monoview and multiview video coding
experiments, we show that our DP algorithm and selection of optimal multipliers
on average outperform comparable rate control solutions used in video
compression standards such as HEVC that do not skip frames in Y-PSNR.

errors for introductory programming problems. Syntax errors constitute one of
the largest classes of errors (34%) in our dataset of student submissions
obtained from a MOOC course on edX. The previous techniques for generating
automated feed- back on programming assignments have focused on functional
correctness and style considerations of student programs. These techniques
analyze the program AST of the program and then perform some dynamic and
symbolic analyses to compute repair feedback. Unfortunately, it is not possible
to generate ASTs for student pro- grams with syntax errors and therefore the
previous feedback techniques are not applicable in repairing syntax errors.
  We present a technique for providing feedback on syntax errors that uses
Recurrent neural networks (RNNs) to model syntactically valid token sequences.
Our approach is inspired from the recent work on learning language models from
Big Code (large code corpus). For a given programming assignment, we first
learn an RNN to model all valid token sequences using the set of syntactically
correct student submissions. Then, for a student submission with syntax errors,
we query the learnt RNN model with the prefix to- ken sequence to predict token
sequences that can fix the error by either replacing or inserting the predicted
token sequence at the error location. We evaluate our technique on over 14, 000
student submissions with syntax errors. Our technique can completely re- pair
31.69% (4501/14203) of submissions with syntax errors and in addition partially
correct 6.39% (908/14203) of the submissions.

supersymmetry is explained via an inverse seesaw mechanism. We evaluate how
much existing ATLAS data constrain such scenarios and obtain roughly a bound of
300 GeV on the charginos if the sneutrinos are lighter than about 120 GeV. For

Higgs boson mass self-energy has led many authors to conclude that the Higgs
theory suffers from a naturalness or fine-tuning problem. However, speculative
new physics ideas to solve this problem have not manifested themselves yet at
high-energy colliders, such as the Large Hadron Collider at CERN. For this
reason, the role of naturalness as a guide to theory model-building is being
severely questioned. Most attacks suggest that one should not resort to
arguments involving gravity, which is a much less understood quantum field
theory. Another line of attack is against the assumption that there exists a
multitude of additional heavy states specifically charged under the Standard
Model gauge symmetries. Nevertheless, if we give ground on both of these
assaults on naturalness, what remains is a naturalness concern over the
prospect of numerous additional spin-zero scalar states in nature. The
proliferation of heavy scalars generically destabilizes the Higgs boson mass,
raising it to the highest and most remote scalar mass values in nature, thus
straining the legitimacy of the Standard Model. The copious use of extra
scalars in theory model building, from explaining flavor physics to providing
an inflationary potential and more, and the generic expectation of extra scalar
bosons in nature argues for the proliferation instability problem being the
central concern for naturalness of the Standard Model. Some approaches to
solving this problem are presented.

other in a medium. Yet, when their field amplitude becomes comparable to the
electron binding energies of matter, the nonlinear motion of these electrons
emits new dipole radiation whose amplitude, frequency and phase differ from the
incoming fields. Such high fields are typically achieved with ultra-short,
femtosecond (1fs = 10-15 sec.) laser pulses containing very broad frequency
spectra. Here, the matter not only couples incoming and outgoing fields but
also causes different spectral components to interact and mix through a
convolution process. In this contribution, we describe how frequency domain
nonlinear optics overcomes the shortcomings arising from this convolution in
conventional time domain nonlinear optics1. We generate light fields with
previously inaccessible properties because the uncontrolled coupling of
amplitudes and phases is turned off. For example, arbitrary phase functions are
transferred linearly to the second harmonic frequency while maintaining the
exact shape of the input power spectrum squared.
  This nonlinear control over output amplitudes and phases opens up new avenues
for applications based on manipulation of coherent light fields. One could
investigate c.f. the effect of tailored nonlinear perturbations on the
evolution of discrete eigenmodes in Anderson localization2. Our approach might
also open a new chapter for controlling electronic and vibrational couplings in

reversal sorting operations on (signed) permutations identified specialized
versions of the these operations. These specialized operations are here called
context directed reversal, abbreviated cdr, and context directed swap,
abbreviated cds. Prior works have also characterized which (signed)
permutations are sortable by cdr or by cds.
  It is now known that when a permutation is cds sortable in n steps, then any
application of n consecutive applicable cds operations will sort it. Examples
show that this is not the case for cdr. This phenomenon is the focus of this
paper. It is proven that if a signed permutation is cdr sortable, then any cdr
fixed point of it is cds sortable (the cds Rescue Theorem). The cds Rescue
Theorem is discussed in the context of a mathematical model for ciliate
micronuclear decryption.
  It is also proven that though for a given permutation the number of cdr
operations leading to different cdr fixed points may be different from each
other, the parity of these two numbers is the same (the cdr Parity Theorem).
This result provides a solution to two previously formulated decision problems
regarding certain combinatorial games.

the new invariance condition is equivalent to isotropy of the linear

$2$. Using the specific group structure of $G$ and a sequence of nested
subgroups of $G$, we define the fast TMFT and its inverse. Since the image
${\cal R}$ of the binary functions is a ring, we can define the convolution
between two functions $f:G\rightarrow {\cal R}$. We then provide the TMFT
properties, including the convolution theorem, which can be used to efficiently
compute convolutions. Finally, we derive the complexity of the fast TMFT and

incoming update packets are forwarded to a remote destination through multiple
servers (each server can be viewed as a wireless channel). One important
performance metric of these systems is the age-of-information or simply age,
which is defined as the time elapsed since the freshest packet at the
destination was generated. Recent studies on information-update systems have
shown that the age-of-information can be reduced by intelligently dropping
stale packets. However, packet dropping may not be appropriate in many
applications, such as news and social updates, where users are interested in
not just the latest updates, but also past news. Therefore, all packets may
need to be successfully delivered. In this paper, we study how to optimize
age-of-information without throughput loss. We consider a general scenario
where incoming update packets do not necessarily arrive in the order of their
generation times. We prove that a preemptive Last Generated First Served (LGFS)
policy simultaneous optimizes the age, throughput, and delay performance in
infinite buffer queueing systems. We also show age-optimality for the LGFS
policy for any finite queue size. These results hold for arbitrary, including
non-stationary, arrival processes. To the best of our knowledge, this paper
presents the first optimal result on minimizing the age-of-information in
communication networks with an external arrival process of information update
packets.

representation allows APIC to conserve linear and angular momentum across
transfers while also dramatically reducing numerical diffusion usually
associated with PIC. Notably, conservation is achieved with lumped mass, as
opposed to the more commonly used Fluid Implicit Particle (FLIP) transfers
which require a 'full' mass matrix for exact conservation. Furthermore, unlike
FLIP, APIC retains a filtering property of the original PIC and thus does not
accumulate velocity modes on particles as FLIP does. In particular, we
demonstrate that APIC does not experience velocity instabilities that are
characteristic of FLIP in a number of Material Point Method (MPM)
hyperelasticity calculations. Lastly, we demonstrate that when combined with
the midpoint rule for implicit update of grid momentum that linear and angular

photon source. Here we use a Monte Carlo scheme to verify if such a fraction is
viable or not. In particular we consider three different Comptonizing medium
geometries: (i) a spherical shell, (ii) a boundary layer like torus and (iii) a
corona on top of an accretion disk. Two set of spectral parameters
corresponding to the 'hot' and 'cold' seed photon models were explored. The
general result of the study is that for a wide range of sizes, the fraction
lies within $\eta \sim 0.3$ - $0.7$, and hence compatible with the range
required to explain the soft time lags. Since there is a large uncertainty in
the range, we cannot concretely rule out any of the geometries or spectral
models, but the analysis suggests that a boundary layer type geometry with a
'cold' seed spectral model is favoured over an accretion corona model. Better
quality data will allow one to constrain the geometry more rigorously. Our
results emphasise that there is significant heating of the soft photon source
by the Comptonized photons and hence this effect needs to be taken into account

long-term interactions between climate and the economy and for deriving optimal
policy responses in the form of carbon prices. IAMs have been criticized for
controversial discount rate assumptions, arbitrary climate damage functions,
and the inadequate handling of potentially catastrophic climate outcomes. We
review these external shortcomings for prominent IAMs before turning our focus
on an internal modeling fallacy: the widespread misapplication of the Constant
Elasticity of Substitution (CES) function for the technology transitions
modeled by IAMs. Applying CES, an economic modeling approach, on technical
factor inputs over long periods where an entire factor (the greenhouse gas
emitting fossil fuel inputs) must be substituted creates artifacts that fail to
match the S-curve patterns observed historically. A policy critical result, the
monotonically increasing cost of carbon, a universal feature of IAMs, is called
into question by showing that it is unrealistic as it is an artifact of the
modeling approach and not representative of the technical substitutability

first through a simple but representative example of CES application on the

elasticity of substitution as a plausible alternative to model the energy

First, they can introduce click biases to reinforce specific links on their

whether two-dimensional (2D) Mott physics can be responsible for unusual
switching between states of different electronic order in the layered
dichalcogenide 1T-TaS2, or it is a result of subtle inter-layer orbitronic
re-ordering of its helical stacking structure. We report on the switching
properties both in-plane and perpendicular to the layers by current-pulse
injection, the anisotropy of electronic transport in the commensurate ground
state, and relaxation properties of the switched metastable state. Contrary to
recent theoretical calculations, which predict a uni-directional metal
perpendicular to the layers, we observe a large resistivity in this direction,
with a temperature-dependent anisotropy. Remarkably, large resistance ratios
are observed in the memristive switching both in-plane (IP) and out-of-plane
(OP). The relaxation dynamics of the metastable state for both IP and OP
electron transport are seemingly governed by the same mesoscopic quantum
re-ordering process. We conclude that 1T-TaS2 shows resistance switching

Accepted for publication in MNRAS",,"10.1093/mnras/stw1052",,"astro-ph.EP","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Kuiper Belt objects with absolute magnitude less than 3 (radius $\gtrsim$500
km), the dwarf planets, have a range of different ice/rock ratios, and are more
rock-rich than their smaller counterparts. Many of these objects have moons,
which suggests that collisions may have played a role in modifying their
compositions. We show that the dwarf planets fall into two categories when
analysed by their mean densities and satellite-to-primary size ratio. Systems
with large moons, such as Pluto/Charon and Orcus/Vanth, can form in
low-velocity grazing collisions in which both bodies retain their compositions.
We propose that these systems retain a primordial composition, with a density
of about 1.8 g/cm$^3$. Triton, thought to be a captured KBO, could have lost
enough ice during its early orbital evolution to explain its rock-enrichment
relative to the primordial material. Systems with small moons, Eris, Haumea,
and Quaoar, formed from a different type of collision in which icy material,
perhaps a few tens of percent of the total colliding mass, is lost. The
fragments would not remain in physical or dynamical proximity to the parent
body. The ice loss process has not yet been demonstrated numerically, which
could be due to the paucity of KBO origin simulations, or missing physical
processes in the impact models. If our hypothesis is correct, we predict that
large KBOs with small moons should be denser than the primordial material, and
that the mean density of Orcus should be close to the primordial value.

However, it brings new data security issues that were absent in volatile memory

ambient parameters such as magnetic field and temperature that can be exploited
to tamper with the stored data. In this paper we propose three techniques to
enable error free computation without stalling the system, (a) stalling where
the system is halted during attack; (b) cache bypass during gradually ramping
attack where the last level cache (LLC) is bypassed and the upper level caches
interact directly with the main memory; and, (c) checkpointing along with
bypass during sudden attack where the processor states are saved periodically
and the LLC is written back at regular intervals. During attack the system goes
back to the last checkpoint and the computation continues with bypassed cache.
We performed simulation for different duration and frequency of attack on
SPLASH benchmark suite and the results show an average of 8% degradation in IPC
for a one-time attack lasting for 50% of the execution time. The energy
overhead is 2% for an attack lasting for the entire duration of execution.

a subset of neurons, can be fused with electrophysiological data to achieve
higher temporal resolution. We apply this approach to simulated and real ground
truth data to demonstrate its higher sensitivity in detecting small
signal-to-noise events and its increased robustness to noise compared to
standard methods for detecting PSCs. The new Bayesian event analysis approach
for electrophysiological recordings should allow for better estimation of

impulsive solar energetic particle (SEP) events, vary approximately as power
laws in the mass-to-charge ratio [A/Q] of the ions. Since the Q-values depend
upon the electron temperature of the source plasma, this has allowed a
determination of this temperature from the pattern of element-abundance
enhancements and a verification of the expected inverse-time dependence of the
power of A/Q for diffusive transport of ions from the SEP events, with
scattering mean free paths found to be between 0.2 and 1 AU. SEP events derived
from plasma of different temperatures map into different regions in typical
cross-plots of abundances, spreading the distributions. In comparisons of SEP
events with temperatures above 2 MK, impulsive events show much broader
non-thermal variation of abundances than do gradual events. The extensive shock
waves accelerating ions in gradual events may average over much of an active
region where numerous but smaller magnetic reconnections, ""nanojets"", produce
suprathermal seed ions, thus averaging over varying abundances, while an
impulsive SEP event only samples one local region of abundance variations.
Evidence for a reference He/O abundance ratio of 91, rather than 57, is also
found for the hotter plasma. However, while this is similar to the solar-wind
abundance of He/O, the solar-wind abundances otherwise provide an unacceptably
poor reference for the SEP abundance enhancements, generating extremely large
errors.

a generalized partitioning method which puts less constraints on the shape of
spatial clusters. Dimension reduction in the parameter space is also achieved
via Bayesian wavelets to alleviate the increasing model complexity introduced
by clusters. The model well captures the regional effects of the atmospheric
and cloud properties on the spectral radiance measurements. The results
elaborate the importance of exploiting spatially contiguous partitions for
identifying regional effects and small-scale variability.

the phenomenologically successful discreet symmetry $A_4$ is embedded. The
allowed quadratic and quartic potentials are constructed exploiting the full
symmetry chain $SU(3)\supset SO(4)\supset A_4$. The spontaneous symmetry
breaking involving the $SU(3)$ octet scalar fields is analyzed.
