the key tools for nuclear astrophysics, in its study of nuclear reactions and
their impacts on objects and phenomena throughout the universe. Gamma rays
trace nuclear processes most directly, as they originate from nuclear
transitions following radioactive decays or high-energy collisions with
excitation of nuclei. Additionally, the unique gamma-ray signature from the
annihilation of positrons falls into this astronomical window and is discussed
here: Cosmic positrons are often produced from beta-decays, thus also of
nuclear physics origins. The nuclear reactions leading to radioactive isotopes
occur inside stars and stellar explosions, which therefore constitute the main
objects of such studies. In recent years, both thermonuclear and core-collapse
supernova radioactivities have been measured, and complement conventional
supernova observations with measurements of their prime energy sources. The
diffuse radioactive afterglow of massive-star nucleosynthesis in gamma rays is
now being analysed towards how massive stars feed back their energy and ejecta
into interstellar gas. Large interstellar cavities and superbubbles have been
recognised to be the dominating structures where new massive-star ejecta are
injected, from 26Al gamma-ray spectroscopy. Finally, the puzzling
bulge-dominated intensity distribution of positron annihilation gamma rays is
measured in greater detail, but still not understood; a recent microquasar
flare provided evidence that such objects may be prime sources for positrons in
interstellar space, rather than distributed nucleosynthesis. We also briefly
discuss the status and prospects for astronomy with telescopes for the
nuclear-radiation energy window.

light quarks, that mediate the gg \to Hg transition. Although their impact is
suppressed by small Yukawa couplings, it is enhanced by large logarithms of the

We study the origin of this enhancement, focusing on the abelian corrections to
gg \to Hg amplitudes of the form (C_F alphas L^{2})^n, where $L \in {
ln(s/mb^2), ln(p_\perp^2/mb^2) }. We show how these non-Sudakov double
logarithmic terms can be resummed to all orders in the strong coupling
constant. Interestingly, we find that the transverse momentum dependence of
these corrections is very weak due to a peculiar cancellation between different
logarithmic terms. Although the abelian part of QCD corrections is not expected
to be dominant, it can be used to estimate missing higher-order corrections to
light quark contributions to Higgs boson production at the LHC.

MU-MISO systems under imperfect Channel State Information at the Transmitter

transmission scheme. In particular, the message intended to one of the users is
split into two parts: a common part which can be recovered by all users, and a
private part recovered by the corresponding user. On the other hand, the rest
of users receive their information through private messages. This
Rate-Splitting (RS) approach was shown to boost the achievable Degrees of
Freedom (DoF) when CSIT errors decay with increased SNR. In this work, the RS
strategy is married with linear precoder design and optimization techniques to
achieve a maximized Ergodic SR (ESR) performance over the entire range of SNRs.
Precoders are designed based on partial CSIT knowledge by solving a stochastic
rate optimization problem using means of Sample Average Approximation (SAA)
coupled with the Weighted Minimum Mean Square Error (WMMSE) approach. Numerical
results show that in addition to the ESR gains, the benefits of RS also include
relaxed CSIT quality requirements and enhanced achievable rate regions compared

describing the surface electrical properties of charged porous media. However,
the zeta potential of calcite is still poorly known because of the difficulty
to interpret streaming potential experiments. The Helmholtz-Smoluchowski (HS)
equation is widely used to estimate the apparent zeta potential from these
experiments. However, this equation neglects the influence of surface
conductivity on streaming potential. We present streaming potential and
electrical conductivity measurements on a calcite powder in contact with an
aqueous NaCl electrolyte. Our streaming potential model corrects the apparent
zeta potential of calcite by accounting for the influence of surface
conductivity and flow regime. We show that the HS equation seriously
underestimates the zeta potential of calcite, particularly when the electrolyte
is diluted (ionic strength < 0.01 M) because of calcite surface conductivity.
The basic Stern model successfully predicted the corrected zeta potential by
assuming that the zeta potential is located at the outer Helmholtz plane, i.e.
without considering a stagnant diffuse layer at the calcite-water interface.
The surface conductivity of calcite crystals was inferred from electrical
conductivity measurements and computed using our basic Stern model. Surface
conductivity was also successfully predicted by our surface complexation model.

wireless body area network (WBAN). We adopt two-hop communication scheme
supported by the the IEEE 802.15.6 standard (2012). In this paper, we propose a
dynamic channel allocation scheme, namely DCAIM to mitigate node-level
interference amongst the coexisting regions of a WBAN. At the time, the sensors
are in the radius communication of a relay, they form a relay region (RG)
coordinated by that relay using time division multiple access (TDMA). In the
proposed scheme, each RG creates a table consisting of interfering sensors
which it broadcasts to its neighboring sensors. This broadcast allows each pair
of RGs to create an interference set (IS). Thus, the members of IS are assigned
orthogonal sub-channels whereas other sonsors that do not belong to IS can
transmit using the same time slots. Experimental results show that our proposal
mitigates node-level interference and improves node and WBAN energy savings.
These results are then compared to the results of other schemes. As a result,
our scheme outperforms in all cases. Node-level signal to interference and
noise ratio (SINR) improved by 11dB whilst, the energy consumption decreased
significantly. We further present a probabilistic method and analytically show
the outage probability can be effectively reduced to the minimal.

effect of different combinations of the density-gradient scale-lengths (Ln) and

energy transfer are illucidated for these multiscale instabilities. Energy for
the unified model is examined, including the injected, conservative
redistribution (between fields and scales), and ultimate dissipation. Various
physical mechanisms involved in the energetics are categorized as sources,
sinks, nonlinear transfer, and coupling to show that the system satisfies the
fundamental law of energy Oonservation. The physics of the nonlinear transfer
terms is studied to identify their roles in producing energy cascades { the
transference of energy from the dominant unstable wavenumbers and driving
irregularities of different scale-lengths. The theory of two-step energy
cascading to generate the 3-meter plasma irregularities in the equatorial

possibility for a reverse energy cascading, responsible for generating
large-scale plasma structures at the top of the electrojet.

the establishment of spatial patterns of gene expression which later direct
proliferating cells to take on different cell fates. These patterns enable the
cells to infer their global position within a tissue or an organism by reading
out local gene expression levels. The patterning system is thus said to encode
positional information, a concept that was formalized recently in the framework
of information theory. Here we introduce a toy model of patterning in one
spatial dimension, which can be seen as an extension of Wolpert's paradigmatic
""French Flag"" model, to patterning by several interacting, spatially coupled
genes subject to intrinsic and extrinsic noise. Our model, a variant of an
Ising spin system, allows us to systematically explore expression patterns that
optimally encode positional information. We find that optimal patterning
systems use positional cues, as in the French Flag model, together with
gene-gene interactions to generate combinatorial codes for position which we
call ""Counter"" patterns. Counter patterns can also be stabilized against noise
and variations in system size or morphogen dosage by longer-range spatial
interactions of the type invoked in the Turing model. The simple setup proposed
here qualitatively captures many of the experimentally observed properties of
biological patterning systems and allows them to be studied in a single,
theoretically consistent framework.

supervised machine learning in computer vision. In recent years CNNs have
outperformed traditional approaches in many computer vision tasks such as
object detection, image classification and face recognition. CNNs are
vulnerable to overfitting, and a lot of research focuses on finding
regularization methods to overcome it. One approach is designing task specific
models based on prior knowledge.
  Several works have shown that properties of natural images can be easily
captured using complex numbers. Motivated by these works, we present a
variation of the CNN model with complex valued input and weights. We construct
the complex model as a generalization of the real model. Lack of order over the
complex field raises several difficulties both in the definition and in the
training of the network. We address these issues and suggest possible
solutions.
  The resulting model is shown to be a restricted form of a real valued CNN
with twice the parameters. It is sensitive to phase structure, and we suggest
it serves as a regularized model for problems where such structure is
important. This suggestion is verified empirically by comparing the performance
of a complex and a real network in the problem of cell detection. The two
networks achieve comparable results, and although the complex model is hard to
train, it is significantly less vulnerable to overfitting. We also demonstrate
that the complex network detects meaningful phase structure in the data.

is not influenced by the cavity and is essentially the same as for
three-dimensional, free space. This is in sharp contrast to the reduced
sensitivity to separation found in idealized low-dimensional settings. The
cavity dynamics only correspond to their reduced dimensional counterparts in
the far field where such excitonic processes are not typically of interest.
There is an intermediate regime, though, where sufficiently small cavities
cause a substantial decrease in separation sensitivity that results in one

to their significant large-scale correlations and prominent baryon acoustic
oscillation (BAO) features, these modes are potentially important for the use
of the BAO as standard ruler. We present a complete treatment of the effects of
the baryon-CDM perturbations on galaxy clustering in the context of a rigorous
perturbative bias expansion. The leading effects are proportional to
$\delta_{bc}$ and $\theta_{bc} = \partial_i v_{bc}^i$. We estimate the
magnitude of these terms through the excursion set approach. The contribution
from $v_{bc}^2$, which has attracted significant attention recently,
contributes at subleading (1-loop) order. The relative-density contribution
$\delta_{bc}$ is expected to be by far the largest contribution. We also point
out contributions to the galaxy velocity bias, the largest of which is simply
$v_{bc}$, leading to a term $\propto \mu^2\theta_{bc}$ in the redshift-space
galaxy power spectrum $P_g^s(k,\mu)$. Complete expressions of the galaxy power
spectrum at 1-loop order are given, which contain several new terms.

  Control Policies in the Cloud (Extended Version)","26 pages; extended version of the IEEE S&P paper",,,,"cs.CR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The ability to enforce robust and dynamic access controls on cloud-hosted
data while simultaneously ensuring confidentiality with respect to the cloud
itself is a clear goal for many users and organizations. To this end, there has
been much cryptographic research proposing the use of (hierarchical)
identity-based encryption, attribute-based encryption, predicate encryption,
functional encryption, and related technologies to perform robust and private
access control on untrusted cloud providers. However, the vast majority of this
work studies static models in which the access control policies being enforced
do not change over time. This is contrary to the needs of most practical
applications, which leverage dynamic data and/or policies. In this paper, we
show that the cryptographic enforcement of dynamic access controls on untrusted
platforms incurs computational costs that are likely prohibitive in practice.
Specifically, we develop lightweight constructions for enforcing role-based
access controls (i.e., $\mathsf{RBAC}_0$) over cloud-hosted files using
identity-based and traditional public-key cryptography. This is done under a
threat model as close as possible to the one assumed in the cryptographic
literature. We prove the correctness of these constructions, and leverage
real-world $\mathsf{RBAC}$ datasets and recent techniques developed by the
access control community to experimentally analyze, via simulation, their
associated computational costs. This analysis shows that supporting revocation,
file updates, and other state change functionality is likely to incur
prohibitive overheads in even minimally-dynamic, realistic scenarios. We
identify a number of bottlenecks in such systems, and fruitful areas for future
work that will lead to more natural and efficient constructions for the
cryptographic enforcement of dynamic access controls.

business have been developed. Many of these are based on the competition
between users, such as online auctions, where the product price is not fixed

cooperation between users, characterized by a dynamic price of the product that
tends to go down. There is not yet a business model in which both sellers and
buyers are grouped in order to negotiate on a specific product or service. The
present study investigates a new extension of the group-buying model, called
fair, which allows aggregation of demand and supply for price optimization, in
a cooperative manner. Additionally, our system also aggregates products and
destinations for shipping optimization. We introduced the following new
relevant input parameters in order to implement a double-side aggregation: (a)
price-quantity curves provided by the seller; (b) waiting time, that is, the
longer buyers wait, the greater discount they get; (c) payment time, which
determines if the buyer pays before, during or after receiving the product; (d)
the distance between the place where products are available and the place of
shipment, provided in advance by the buyer or dynamically suggested by the
system. To analyze the proposed model we implemented a system prototype and a
simulator that allow to study effects of changing some input parameters. We
analyzed the dynamic price model in fairs having one single seller and a
combination of selected sellers. The results are very encouraging and motivate
further investigation on this topic.

black-hole systems is located on the rotation axis close to the horizon. We
point out a number of inconsistencies in the widely used lamppost model
relxilllp, e.g., the neglect of the redshift of the photons emitted by the
lamppost and directly observed. They appear to invalidate those model fitting
results for which the source distances from the horizon are within several
gravitational radii. Furthermore, if those results were correct, most of the
photons produced in the lamppost would be trapped by the black hole, and the
luminosity generated in the source as measured at infinity would be much larger
than that observed. This appears to be in conflict with the observed smooth
state transitions between the hard and soft states of X-ray binaries. The
required increase of the accretion rate and the associated efficiency reduction
present also a problem for AGNs. Then, those models imply the luminosity
measured in the local frame to be much higher than that produced in the source
and measured at infinity, due to the additional effects of time dilation and
redshift, and the electron temperature to be higher significantly than that
observed. We show that these conditions imply that the fitted sources would be
out of the pair equilibrium. On the other hand, the above issues pose
relatively minor problems for sources at large distances from the black hole,

observed in ten galaxies and marginally detected in another one. CO fluxes
correlate with the FIR 250 $\mu$m emission, and the dwarfs follow the same
linear relation that holds for more massive spiral galaxies extended to a wider
dynamical range. We compare different methods to estimate H2 molecular masses,
namely a metallicity-dependent CO-to-H2 conversion factor and one dependent on
H-band luminosity. The molecular-to-stellar mass ratio remains nearly constant
at stellar masses <~ 10$^9$ M$_{\odot}$, contrary to the atomic hydrogen
fraction, M$_{HI}$/M$_*$, which increases inversely with M$_*$. The flattening
of the M$_{H_2}$/M$_*$ ratio at low stellar masses does not seem to be related
to the effects of the cluster environment because it occurs for both
HI-deficient and HI-normal dwarfs. The molecular-to-atomic ratio is more
tightly correlated with stellar surface density than metallicity, confirming
that the interstellar gas pressure plays a key role in determining the balance
between the two gaseous components of the interstellar medium. Virgo dwarfs
follow the same linear trend between molecular gas mass and star formation rate
as more massive spirals, but gas depletion timescales, $\tau_{dep}$, are not
constant and range between 100 Myr and 6 Gyr. The interaction with the Virgo
cluster environment is removing the atomic gas and dust components of the
dwarfs, but the molecular gas appears to be less affected at the current stage
of evolution within the cluster. However, the correlation between HI deficiency
and the molecular gas depletion time suggests that the lack of gas
replenishment from the outer regions of the disc is lowering the star formation
activity.

Euler equations of ideal fluid dynamics are smoothed particle hydrodynamics and
finite volume discretization on a stationary mesh. However, the goal to
efficiently make use of future exascale machines with their ever higher degree
of parallel concurrency motivates the search for more efficient and more
accurate techniques for computing hydrodynamics. Discontinuous Galerkin (DG)
methods represent a promising class of methods in this regard, as they can be
straightforwardly extended to arbitrarily high order while requiring only small
stencils. Especially for applications involving comparatively smooth problems,
higher-order approaches promise significant gains in computational speed for
reaching a desired target accuracy. Here, we introduce our new astrophysical DG
code TENET designed for applications in cosmology, and discuss our first
results for 3D simulations of subsonic turbulence. We show that our new DG
implementation provides accurate results for subsonic turbulence, at
considerably reduced computational cost compared with traditional finite volume
methods. In particular, we find that DG needs about 1.8 times fewer degrees of
freedom to achieve the same accuracy and at the same time is more than 1.5
times faster, confirming its substantial promise for astrophysical
applications.

supermassive black holes (SMBHs) is of great interest for understanding
accretion processes and galaxy evolution. However, in these early days of spin
measurements, consistency and reproducibility of spin constraints have been a
challenge. Here we focus on X-ray spectral modelling of active galactic nuclei
(AGN), examining how well we can truly return known reflection parameters such
as spin under standard conditions. We have created and fit over 4000 simulated
Seyfert 1 spectra each with 375$\pm$1k counts. We assess the fits with
reflection fraction of $R$ = 1 as well as reflection-dominated AGN with $R$ =
5. We also examine the consequence of permitting fits to search for retrograde
spin. In general, we discover that most parameters are over-estimated when
spectroscopy is restricted to the 2.5 - 10.0 keV regime and that models are
insensitive to inner emissivity index and ionization. When the bandpass is
extended out to 70keV, parameters are more accurately estimated. Repeating the
process for $R$ = 5 reduces our ability to measure photon index ($\sim$3 to 8
per cent error and overestimated), but increases precision in all other
parameters -- most notably ionization, which becomes better constrained
($\pm$45 erg cm $\rm{s^{-1}}$) for low ionization parameters ($\xi$$<$200 erg
cm $\rm{s^{-1}}$). In all cases, we find the spin parameter is only well
measured for the most rapidly rotating supermassive black holes (i.e. $a$ $>$
0.8 to about $\pm$0.10) and that inner emissivity index is never well
constrained. Allowing our model to search for retrograde spin did not improve
the results.

Cumulative Sum of Squares (ICSS) and Sequential Regime Shift Detector (SRSD),
have been compared on both synthetic and observed time series. In Monte Carlo
experiments, SRSD outperformed ICSS in the overwhelming majority of the
modelled scenarios with different sequences of variance regimes. The SRSD
advantage was particularly apparent in the case of outliers in the series. When
tested on climatic time series, in most cases both methods detected the same
change points in the longer series (252-787 monthly values). The only exception
was the Arctic Ocean SST series, when ICSS found one extra change point that
appeared to be spurious. As for the shorter time series (66-136 yearly values),
ICSS failed to detect any change points even when the variance doubled or
tripled from one regime to another. For these time series, SRSD is recommended.
Interestingly, all the climatic time series tested, from the Arctic to the
Tropics, had one thing in common: the last shift detected in each of these
series was toward a high-variance regime. This is consistent with other
findings of increased climate variability in recent decades.

also be applied to microscopic models of superconducting vortices and complex

an accurate measurement of the baryonic Tully-Fisher relation (BTFR). These
galaxies are specifically selected to be heavily gas-dominated (Mgas/M* >~ 2.7)
and to be oriented edge-on. The former property ensures that the error on the
galactic baryonic mass is small, despite the large systematic uncertainty
involved in galactic stellar mass estimates. The latter property means that
rotational velocities can be derived directly from the width of the 21cm
emission line, without any need for inclination corrections. We measure a slope
for the linewidth-based BTFR of alpha = 3.75 +- 0.11, a value that is somewhat
steeper than (but in broad agreement with) previous literature results. The
relation is remarkably tight, with almost all galaxies being located within a
perpendicular distance of +- 0.1 dex from the best fit line. The low
observational error budget for our sample enables us to establish that, despite
its tightness, the measured linewidth-based BTFR has some small (i.e.,
non-zero) intrinsic scatter. We furthermore find a systematic difference in the
BTFR of galaxies with ""double-horned"" 21cm line profiles and those with
""peaked"" profiles. When we restrict our sample of galaxies to objects in the
former category, we measure a slightly steeper slope of alpha = 4.13 +- 0.15.
Overall, the high-accuracy measurement of the BTFR presented in this article is
intended as a reliable observational benchmark against which to test
theoretical expectations. Here we consider a representative set of
semi-analytic models and hydrodynamic simulations in the LCDM context, as well
as MOND. In the near future, interferometric follow-up observations of several
sample members will enable us to further refine the BTFR measurement, and make
sharper comparisons with theoretical models.

the fair division problem for such agents, which is harder to handle due to
discontinuity and complementarities of the preferences.
  Our solution concept---the competitive allocation from equal incomes

through a pricing mechanism. We study the existence and computation of CAEI for
multiple divisible goods, cake cutting, and multiple discrete goods. For the
first two scenarios we show that existence of CAEI solutions is guaranteed,

obtain efficient algorithms for (i) divisible and discrete goods when the
number of different \emph{types} of players is a constant, (ii) cake cutting

service-oriented, flexible, and spectrum/energy-efficient edge-to-core
infrastructure, aiming to offer diverse applications. Convergence of
software-defined networking (SDN), software-defined radio (SDR) compatible with
multiple radio access technologies (RATs), and virtualization on the concept of
5G software-defined wireless networking (5G-SDWN) is a promising approach to
provide such a dynamic network. The principal technique behind the 5G-SDWN
framework is the separation of the control and data planes, from the deep core
entities to edge wireless access points (APs). This separation allows the
abstraction of resources as transmission parameters of each user over the
5G-SDWN. In this user-centric and service-oriented environment, resource
management plays a critical role to achieve efficiency and reliability.
However, it is natural to wonder if 5G-SDWN can be leveraged to enable
converged multi-layer resource management over the portfolio of resources, and
reciprocally, if CML resource management can effectively provide performance
enhancement and reliability for 5G-SDWN. We believe that replying to these
questions and investigating this mutual synergy are not trivial, but
multidimensional and complex for 5G-SDWN, which consists of different
technologies and also inherits legacy generations of wireless networks. In this
paper, we propose a flexible protocol structure based on three mentioned
pillars for 5G-SDWN, which can handle all the required functionalities in a
more crosslayer manner. Based on this, we demonstrate how the general framework
of CML resource management can control the end user quality of experience. For
two scenarios of 5G-SDWN, we investigate the effects of joint user-association
and resource allocation via CML resource management to improve performance in a
virtualized network.

diseases in livestock populations. As a case study, we consider pig trade in
Germany, where trade actors (agricultural premises) form a complex network. The
central question is how infectious diseases can potentially spread within the
system of trade contacts. We address this question by analyzing the underlying
network of animal movements.
  Methodology/Findings: The considered pig trade dataset spans several years
and is analyzed with respect to its potential to spread infectious diseases.
Focusing on measurements of network-topological properties, we avoid the usage
of external parameters, since these properties are independent of specific
pathogens. They are on the contrary of great importance for understanding any
general spreading process on this particular network. We analyze the system
using different network models, which include varying amounts of information:
(i) static network, (ii) network as a time series of uncorrelated snapshots,
(iii) temporal network, where causality is explicitly taken into account.
  Findings: Our approach provides a general framework for a
topological-temporal characterization of livestock trade networks. We find that
a static network view captures many relevant aspects of the trade system, and
premises can be classified into two clearly defined risk classes. Moreover, our
results allow for an efficient allocation strategy for intervention measures
using centrality measures. Data on trade volume does barely alter the results
and is therefore of secondary importance. Although a static network description
yields useful results, the temporal resolution of data plays an outstanding
role for an in-depth understanding of spreading processes. This applies in
particular for an accurate calculation of the maximum outbreak size.

can only be induced by Majorana neutrinos. Distinguishing between Dirac and
Majorana nature of neutrinos is an outstanding problem and hence, all possible
searches for Majorana neutrinos need to be carried out. Since the lepton number
violating modes are expected to be rare, when using meson decay modes for these
searches one expects CKM favoured modes to be the preferred ones;
$B_{c}\rightarrow B_{s}$ is one such transition. With a resonance enhancement
of the Majorana neutrino mediating the
$B_{c}^{-}\rightarrow\overline{B}_{s}^{0}\ell_{1}{-}\ell_{2}^{-}\pi^{+}$ modes
one can hope to observe these rare modes, or, even their non-observation can be
used to obtain constraints on the mixing angles of the heavy Majorana singlet
with the light flavour neutrinos from upper limits of the branching fractions
which are tighter or compatible with results from earlier studies. Also, we
find that the relatively suppressed mode $B_{c}^{-}\rightarrow
J/\psi\ell_{1}^{-}\ell_{2}^{-}\pi^{+}$ can provide even tighter constraints on
$\mid V_{e N}\mid^2$, $\mid V_{\mu N}\mid^2$, $\mid V_{e N} V_{\mu N}\mid$, and
in a larger range of the heavy neutrino mass. Further, exclusion regions for
$\mid V_{e N} V_{\tau N}\mid$, $\mid V_{\mu N} V_{\tau N}\mid$ can also be
obtained for masses larger than those accessible in tau decays. Upper limits on
$\mathscr{B}\left(B_{c}^{-}\rightarrow\pi^{+}\ell_{1}^{-}\ell_{2}^{-}\right)$
can also result in stringent exclusion curves for all the mixing elements,

two-gap superconductivity, determined the value of the large and the small
superconducting gaps, and the corresponding BCS-ratios. The temperature
dependencies of the large and the small gaps $\Delta_{L,S}(T)$ are similar for
various families of the Fe-based superconductors and could be well-fitted in
the framework of the two-band model by Moskalenko and Suhl. We concluded on the
extended s-wave symmetry of the $\Delta_L$ order parameter (20-30 % anisotropy
in k-space) and on the absence of nodes for $\Delta_S$. The BCS-ratio
$2\Delta_L/k_BT_C \approx 5.2$ is nearly constant within the whole range of
$T_C$ (this means that coupling rate is unchanged), reflecting the 20 %
reduction of the $T_C^{local}$ in relation to the eigen $T_C^L$, and the large
gap roughly corresponds to the energy of magnetic resonance $2\Delta_L \approx
E_{res}$. This result requires a special theoretical consideration. Our
estimation of the relative coupling constants and eigen parameters of each

$2\Delta_L/k_BT_C^L = 4.2 - 4.8$ and $2\Delta_S/k_BT_C^S = 3.5 - 4.5$ leads to
indirect conclusion that namely a strong electron-phonon interaction in each

role in the superconductivity of iron-based oxypnictides. With it, the two
condensates interact weakly with each other. The observed scaling of
$\Delta_{L,S}$ with $T_C$, as was discussed above, is caused mainly by changing
of the density of states $N_{L,S}$ in the bands, whereas Ln-O spacers act as

interference leading to outage. We therefore propose a mixed multi-cell system,

the simple random walk under the multidimensional Pitman transform and can be
expressed in terms of specializations of Schur functions. This result has been

chambers and we compute their laws. Namely, we consider the conditioning for
these walks to stay in these cones until an instant we let tend to infinity. We
also prove that the laws so obtained can be recovered by letting the drift tend
to zero in the transitions matrices obtained in [LLP1]. We also conjecture our
results remain true in the more general case of a drift in the frontier of the

  We prove that ${\rm Stab}(D^b(K(l)))\cong {\mathbb C}\times \mathcal H$ for
$l\geq 3$, where $K(l)$ is $l$-Kronecker quiver. This is an example of SOD,
where ${\rm Stab}( \langle \mathcal T_1,\mathcal T_2\rangle )\not \cong{\rm
Stab}(\mathcal T_1)\times {\rm Stab}(\mathcal T_2)$.
  This example suggest a new notion of a norm, strictly increasing on
$\{D^b(K(l))\}_{l\geq 2}$. To a triangulated category $\mathcal T$ which has
property of a phase gap we attach a non-negative number $\Vert \mathcal T
\Vert_{\varepsilon}$. Natural assumptions on a SOD imply $ \Vert \langle
\mathcal T_1,\mathcal T_2\rangle \Vert_{\varepsilon}\geq {\rm max}\{ \Vert
\mathcal T_1 \Vert_{\varepsilon}, \Vert\mathcal T_2 \Vert_{\varepsilon}\}$.
Using this we define a topology on the set of equivalence classes of
triangulated categories with a phase gap, where the set of discrete derived
categories is a discrete subset and the rationality of a smooth surface $S$
ensures that $[D^b(point)] \in {\rm Cl}([D^b(S)])$.
  Viewing $D^b(K(l))$ as a non-commutative curve, we observe that it is
reasonable to count non-commutative curves in any category in a small
neighborhood of $D^b(K(l))$. Examples show that this idea (non-commutative
curve-counting) opens directions to new categorical structures and connections
to number theory and classical geometry. We give a definition, which
specializes to the non-commutative curve-counting invariants. In an example
arising on the A side we specialize our definition to non-commutative
Calabi-Yau curve-counting, where the entities we count are a Calabi-Yau
modification of $D^b(K(l))$.
  Finally we speculate that one might consider a holomorphic family of
categories, introduced by Kontsevich, as a non-commutative extension with the
norm playing a role similar to the classical notion of degree of an extension
in Galois theory.

deepest high-frequency radio survey to date, covering 12 square degrees to a
completeness limit of 0.5 mJy, making it the ideal starting point from which to
study this population. In this work we have matched the 10C survey to several
lower-frequency radio catalogues and a wide range of multi-wavelength data
(near- and far-infrared, optical and X-ray). We find a significant increase in
the proportion of flat-spectrum sources at flux densities below 1 mJy - the
median radio spectral index between 15.7 GHz and 610 MHz changes from 0.75 for
flux densities greater than 1.5 mJy to 0.08 for flux densities less than 0.8
mJy. The multi-wavelength analysis shows that the vast majority (> 94 percent)
of the 10C sources are radio galaxies; it is therefore likely that these faint,
flat spectrum sources are a result of the cores of radio galaxies becoming
dominant at high frequencies. We have used new observations to extend this
study to even fainter flux densities, calculating the 15.7-GHz radio source
count down to 0.1 mJy, a factor of five deeper than previous studies. There is
no evidence for a new population of sources, showing that the high-frequency
sky continues to be dominated by radio galaxies down to at least 0.1 mJy.

dramatically in academia. In this study, we investigate retractions from a
quantitative perspective, aiming to answer two fundamental questions. One, how
do retractions influence the scholarly impact of retracted papers, authors, and
institutions? Two, does this influence propagate to the wider academic
community through scholarly associations? Specifically, we analyzed a set of
retracted articles indexed in Thomson Reuters Web of Science (WoS), and ran
multiple experiments to compare changes in scholarly impact against a control
set of non-retracted articles, authors, and institutions. We further applied
the Granger Causality test to investigate whether different scientific topics
are dynamically affected by retracted papers occurring within those topics. Our
results show two key findings: first, the scholarly impact of retracted papers
and authors significantly decreases after retraction, and the most severe
impact decrease correlates to retractions based on proven purposeful scientific
misconduct; second, this retraction penalty does not seem to spread through the
broader scholarly social graph, but instead has a limited and localized effect.
Our findings may provide useful insights for scholars or science committees to
evaluate the scholarly value of papers, authors, or institutions related to
retractions.

function in vacuum and nuclear matter is performed. The consistency is examined
between the constraints derived from finite energy QCD sum rules and the
spectra computed within an improved vector dominance model, incorporating the
coupling of kanonic degrees of freedom with the bare $\phi$ meson. In the
vacuum, recent accurate measurements of the $e^+ e^- \to K^+ K^-$ cross section
allow us to determine the spectral function with high precision. In nuclear
matter, the modification of the spectral function can be described by the
interactions of the kaons from $\phi \rightarrow K\bar{K}$ with the surrounding
nuclear medium. This leads primarily to a strong broadening and an asymmetric
deformation of the $\phi$ meson peak structure. We confirm that, both in vacuum

functions satisfy the requirements of the finite energy sum rules to a
remarkable degree of accuracy. Limits on the strangeness sigma term of the

framework for registration based tracking called Modular Tracking Framework
(MTF). Targeted at robotics applications, it is implemented entirely in C++ and
designed from the ground up to easily integrate with systems that support any
of several major vision and robotics libraries including OpenCV, ROS, ViSP and
Eigen. It implements more methods, is faster, and more precise than other
existing systems. Further, the theoretical basis for its design is a new way to
conceptualize registration based trackers that decomposes them into three
constituent sub modules - Search Method (SM), Appearance Model (AM) and State
Space Model (SSM).
  In the process, we integrate many important advances published after Baker \&
Matthews' landmark work in 2004. In addition to being a practical solution for
fast and high precision tracking, MTF can also serve as a useful research tool
by allowing existing and new methods for any of the sub modules to be studied
better. When a new method is introduced for one of these, the breakdown can
help to experimentally find the combination of methods for the others that is
optimum for it. By extensive use of generic programming, MTF makes it easy to
plug in a new method for any of the sub modules so that it can not only be
tested comprehensively with existing methods but also become immediately
available for deployment in any project that uses the framework. With 16 AMs,
11 SMs and 13 SSMs implemented already, MTF provides over 2000 distinct single
layer trackers. It also allows two or more of these to be combined together in
several ways to create a practically unlimited variety of novel multi layer
trackers.

mid-infrared (MIR) measurements of active galactic nuclei (AGN). Our goal is to
determine the general properties of the circumnuclear dusty environments.
  Methods: We used the MIR interferometric data of a sample of AGNs provided by
the instrument MIDI/VLTI and followed a statistical approach to compare the
observed distribution of the interferometric data with the distributions
computed from clumpy torus models. We mainly tested whether the diversity of
Seyfert galaxies can be described using the Standard Model idea. In addition to
line-of-sight (LOS) effects, we performed different realizations of the same
model to include possible variations that are caused by the stochastic nature
of the dusty models.
  Results: We find that our entire sample of AGNs, which contains both Seyfert
types, cannot be explained merely by an inclination effect and by including
random variations of the clouds. Instead, we find that each subset of Seyfert
type can be explained by different models, where the filling factor at the
inner radius seems to be the largest difference. For type I objects we find
that about two thirds of our objects could also be described using a dusty
torus similar to the type II objects. For the remaining third, it was not
possible to find a good description using models with high filling factors,
while we found good fits with models with low filling factors.
  Conclusions: Within our model assumptions, we did not find one single set of
model parameters that could simultaneously explain the MIR data of all 21 AGN
with LOS effects and random variations alone. We conclude that at least two
distinct cloud configurations are required to model the differences in Seyfert
galaxies, with volume-filling factors differing by a factor of about 5-10. A
continuous transition between the two types cannot be excluded.

intensification and relaxation of circulatory flows within atmospheres. The
dynamical core of the GCM has been modified to include the orbit-spin coupling
accelerations due to solar system dynamics for the years 1920-2030. The
modified GCM is first subjected to extensive testing and validation. We compare
forced and unforced model outcomes for large-scale zonal and meridional flows,
and for near-surface wind velocities and surface wind stresses. The predicted
cycles of circulatory intensification and relaxation within the modified GCM
are observed. Most remarkably, the modified GCM reproduces conditions favorable
for the occurrence of perihelion-season global-scale dust storms on Mars in
years in which such storms were observed. A strengthening of the meridional
overturning (Hadley) circulation during the dust storm season occurs in the GCM
in all previously known years with perihelion-season global-scale dust storms.
The increased upwelling produced in the southern hemisphere in southern summer
may facilitate the transport of dust to high altitudes in the Mars atmosphere
during the dust storm season, where radiative heating may further strengthen
the circulation. Significantly increased surface winds and surface wind
stresses are also obtained. These may locally facilitate saltation and dust
lifting from the surface. The numerical simulations constitute proof of concept
for the orbit-spin coupling hypothesis under evaluation.

\ion{C}{4} and \ion{Mg}{2} are strongly correlated with band-integrated
luminosities. We find that while the slope of the spectral energy distribution,
FUV/NUV, increases by approximately two orders of magnitude form early K to

their corresponding habitable zone distances are constant to within factors of
a few, spanning the range 10~--~70 erg cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$ in the habitable
zone. Despite the lack of strong stellar activity indicators in their optical

indistinguishable from a $(3 + 3N)$-neutrino framework for modest values of

(nearly) edge-on disc galaxies, though to date a robust method to quantify them
is lacking. Using Fourier harmonics to describe the deviation of galaxy
isophotes from ellipses, we demonstrate with a sample of 11 such galaxies
(including NGC 128) that the sixth Fourier component ($B_6$) carries physical
meaning by tracing this X/P structure. We introduce five quantitative
diagnostics based on the radial $B_6$ profile, namely: its `peak' amplitude
($\Pi_{\rm max}$); the (projected major-axis) `length' where this peak occurs
($R_{\Pi,max}$); its vertical `height' above the disc plane ($z_{\Pi,max}$);
the $B_6$ profile's integrated `strength' ($S_{\Pi}$); and the $B_6$ peak
`width' ($W_{\Pi}$). We also introduce different `classes' of $B_6$ profile
shape. Furthermore, we convincingly detect and measure the properties of
multiple (nested) X/P structures in individual galaxies which additionally
display the signatures of multiple bars in their surface brightness profiles,
thus consolidating further the scenario in which peanuts are associated with
bars. We reveal that the peanut parameter space (`length', `strength' and
`height') for real galaxies is not randomly populated, but the 3 metrics are
inter-correlated (both in kpc and disc scale-length $h$). Additionally, the X/P
`length' and `strength' appear to correlate with $v_{rot}/\sigma_*$, lending
further support to the notion that peanuts `know' about the galactic disc in
which they reside. Such constraints are important for simulations, as they
provide a direct link between peanuts and their host disc. Our diagnostics
reveal a spectrum of X/P properties and could provide a means of distinguishing
between different peanut formation scenarios. Moreover, nested peanuts, as
remnants of bar buckling events, can provide insights into the disc and bar
instability history.

crossing time t_* = 16 min is among the shortest ever published. The
high-cadence, wide-field observations that are the hallmark of KMTNet are the
only way to routinely capture such short crossings. High-cadence resolution of
short caustic crossings will preferentially lead to mass and distance

clumps with typical baryonic masses in the range $10^7-10^8$~M$_{\odot}$ which
can affect the orbital decay and concurrent growth of supermassive black hole
(BH) pairs. Using a set of high-resolution simulations of isolated clumpy
galaxies hosting a pair of unequal-mass BHs, we study the interaction between
massive clumps and a BH pair at kpc scales, during the early phase of the
orbital decay. We find that both the interaction with massive clumps and the
heating of the cold gas layer of the disc by BH feedback tend to delay
significantly the orbital decay of the secondary, which in many cases is
ejected and then hovers for a whole Gyr around a separation of 1--2 kpc. In the
envelope, dynamical friction is weak and there is no contribution of disc
torques: these lead to the fastest decay once the orbit of the secondary BH has
circularised in the disc midplane. In runs with larger eccentricities the delay
is stronger, although there are some exceptions. We also show that, even in
discs with very sporadic transient clump formation, a strong spiral pattern
affects the decay time-scale for BHs on eccentric orbits. We conclude that,
contrary to previous belief, a gas-rich background is not necessarily conducive
to a fast BH decay and binary formation, which prompts more extensive
investigations aimed at calibrating event-rate forecasts for ongoing and future
gravitational-wave searches, such as with Pulsar Timing Arrays and the future
evolved Laser Interferometer Space Antenna.

as they are a rich source of phenomenology, while also being well motivated by
top-down approaches to beyond the Standard Model physics. The early (pre-BBN)
matter phase in these models leads to enhanced growth of density perturbations
on sub-Hubble scales. Here we consider whether primordial black hole formation
associated with the enhanced growth is in conflict with existing observations.
Such constraints depend on the tilt of the primordial power spectrum, and we
find that non-thermal histories are tightly constrained in the case of a
significantly blue spectrum. Alternatively, if dark matter is taken to be of
non-thermal origin we can restrict the primordial power spectrum on scales
inaccessible to CMB and LSS observations. We establish constraints for a wide
range of scalar masses (reheat temperatures) with the most stringent bounds
resulting from the formation of $10^{15}$ g black holes. These black holes
would be evaporating today and are constrained by FERMI observations. We also
consider whether the breakdown of the coherence of the scalar oscillations on
sub-horizon scales can lead to a Jean's pressure preventing black hole
formation and relaxing our constraints. Our main conclusion is that primordial
black hole constraints, combined with existing constraints on non-thermal
WIMPs, favor a primordial spectrum closer to scale invariance or a red tilted

pair can fake a photon, either converted or unconverted, at the LHC. The
detailed object identification relies on the specifics of the detector and
strategies for the reconstruction. We study the fake rate based on the
ATLAS(CMS) detector geometry and show that it can be O(1) with a generic choice
of parameters. Especially, the probability of being registered as a photon is
angular dependent. Such detector effects can induce bias to measurements on
certain properties of new physics. In this paper, we consider the scenario
where dark photons in final states are from a heavy resonance decay.
Consequently, the detector effects can dramatically affect the results when
determine the spin of a resonance. Further, if the decay products from the
heavy resonance are one photon and one dark photon, which has a large
probability to fake a diphoton event, the resonance is allowed to be a vector.
Due to the difference in detector, the cross sections measured in ATLAS and CMS
do not necessarily match. Furthermore, if the diphoton signal is given by the
dark photons, the SM $Z\gamma$ and $ZZ$ final states do not necessarily come
with the $\gamma\gamma$ channel, which is a unique signature in our scenario.

branch poses computational challenges, and previous studies restricted
architectures to equal-mass planets. Here, we remove this constraint and
perform over 450 numerical integrations over a Hubble time (14 Gyr) of packed
planetary systems with unequal-mass planets. We characterize the resulting
trends as a function of planet order and mass. We find that intrusive radial
incursions in the vicinity of the white dwarf become less likely as the
dispersion amongst planet masses increases. The orbital meandering which may
sustain a sufficiently dynamic environment around a white dwarf to explain
observations is more dependent on the presence of terrestrial-mass planets than
any variation in planetary mass. Triggering unpacking or instability during the
white dwarf phase is comparably easy for systems of unequal-mass planets and
systems of equal-mass planets; instabilities during the giant branch phase
remain rare and require fine-tuning of initial conditions. We list the key

This boxy, X-shaped bulge morphology is not unique to the Milky Way and such

that boxy and X-shaped bulges are formed from the disk via dynamical

the fact that both the leading local and non-local terms can be obtained within

relative velocity distribution of dust particles in self-gravitating
protoplanetary discs with a view to assessing the viability of planetesimal
formation via direct collapse in such environments. The viability depends
crucially on the large sizes that are preferentially collected in pressure
maxima produced by transient spiral features (Stokes numbers, $St \sim 1$);
growth to these size scales requires that collision velocities remain low
enough that grain growth is not reversed by fragmentation. We show that, for a
single sized dust population, velocity driving by the disc's gravitational
perturbations is only effective for $St > 3$, while coupling to the gas
velocity dominates otherwise. We develop a criterion for understanding this
result in terms of the stopping distance being of order the disc scale height.
Nevertheless, the relative velocities induced by differential radial drift in
multi-sized dust populations are too high to allow the growth of silicate dust
particles beyond $St \sim 10^{-2}$ or $10^{-1}$ ($10\,\mathrm{cm}$ to
$\mathrm{m}$ sizes at $30\,\mathrm{au}$), such Stokes numbers being
insufficient to allow concentration of solids in spiral features. However, for
icy solids (which may survive collisions up to several
$10\,\mathrm{m\,s}^{-1}$), growth to $St \sim 1$ ($10\,\mathrm{m}$ size) may be
possible beyond $30\,\mathrm{au}$ from the star. Such objects would be
concentrated in spiral features and could potentially produce larger icy
planetesimals/comets by gravitational collapse. These planetesimals would
acquire moderate eccentricities and remain unmodified over the remaining
lifetime of the disc.

these features when including an additional contribution from the intermediate
neutron-capture process (i process), which perhaps operated by the ingestion of
H in He-burning convective regions in massive stars, super-AGB stars, or
low-mass AGB stars. Currently, only the i process appears capable of
consistently producing the super-solar [As/Ge] ratios and ratios among

visibility and the conductance allows us to obtain the visibility of realistic
braiding experiments in nanowires, and to conclude that the current
experimentally accessible systems with non-ideal zero bias conductance peaks
may indeed manifest (with rather low visibility) non-Abelian statistics for the
Majorana zero modes. In general, we find that large (small) superconducting gap
(Majorana peak splitting) is essential for the manifestation of the non-Abelian

matrices, which only assumes that quantum theory holds locally in some
observers' laboratories, but does not impose a global causal structure; it was
then shown, on a more practical level, that the quantum switch---a new resource
for quantum computation that goes beyond causally ordered circuits---provided
precisely a physical example of a causally nonseparable process. To demonstrate
that a given process is causally nonseparable, we introduced in [Ara\'ujo et
al., New J. Phys. 17, 102001 (2015)] the concept of witnesses of causal
nonseparability. Here we present a shorter introduction to this concept, and
concentrate on some explicit examples to show how to construct and use such
witnesses in practice.

Wilson-type fermions provides an alternative lattice regularization of the
Schr\""odinger functional (SF), with different lattice symmetries and a common
continuum limit expected from universality. The explicit breaking of flavour
and parity symmetries needs to be repaired by tuning the bare fermion mass and
the coefficient of a dimension 3 boundary counterterm. Once this is achieved
one expects the mechanism of automatic O($a$) improvement to be operational in
the $\chi$SF, in contrast to the standard formulation of the SF. This is
expected to significantly improve the attainable precision for step-scaling
functions of some composite operators. Furthermore, the $\chi$SF offers new
strategies to determine finite renormalization constants which are
traditionally obtained from chiral Ward identities. In this paper we consider a
complete set of fermion bilinear operators, define corresponding correlation
functions and explain the relation to their standard SF counterparts. We
discuss renormalization and O($a$) improvement and then use this set-up to
formulate the theoretical expectations which follow from universality.
Expanding the correlation functions to one-loop order of perturbation theory we
then perform a number of non-trivial checks. In the process we obtain the
action counterterm coefficients to one-loop order and reproduce some known
perturbative results for renormalization constants of fermion bilinears. By
confirming the theoretical expectations, this perturbative study lends further
support to the soundness of the $\chi$SF framework and prepares the ground for
non-perturbative applications.

ordinary complex orientations, and lifting from stage (m-1) to stage m is
governed by the existence of a orientation for a family of E-modules over a
fixed base space F_m.
  When E is p-local, we can say more. We find that this tower only changes when
m is a power of p, and if E is E(n)-local the tower is constant after stage
p^n. Moreover, if the coefficient ring E^* is p-torsion free, the ability to
lift from stage 1 to stage p is equivalent to a condition on the associated

identical in all dimensions. Meaningful point particle limits are quite
different in different dimensions, however. These limits are defined and
evaluated, resulting in simple ""regularization algorithms"" which can be used in
concrete calculations. In these limits, self-interaction is shown to be
progressively less important in higher numbers of dimensions; it generically
competes in magnitude with increasingly high-order extended-body effects.
Conversely, we show that self-interaction effects can be relatively large in
$1+1$ and $2+1$ dimensions. Our motivations for this work are twofold: First,
no previous derivation of the self-force has been provided in arbitrary
dimensions, and heuristic arguments presented by different authors have
resulted in conflicting conclusions. Second, the static self-force problem in
arbitrary dimensions provides a valuable testbed with which to continue the
development of general, non-perturbative methods in the theory of motion.
Several new insights are obtained in this direction, including a significantly
improved understanding of the renormalization process. We also show that there
is considerable freedom to use different ""effective fields"" in the laws of
motion---a freedom which can be exploited to optimally simplify specific
problems. Different choices give rise to different inertias, gravitational
forces, and electromagnetic or scalar self-forces, but there is a sense in
which none of these quantities are individually accessible to experiment.
Certain combinations are observable, however, and these remain invariant under

pressures have presumably driven it to make productive use of its resources.
For sensory areas, this concept has been expressed more formally as an
optimality principle: the brain maximizes the information that is encoded about
relevant sensory variables, given available resources. Here, we develop this
efficiency principle for encoding a sensory variable with a heterogeneous
population of noisy neurons, each responding to a particular range of values.
The accuracy with which the population represents any particular value depends
on the number of cells that respond to that value, their selectivity, and their
response levels. We derive the optimal solution for these parameters in closed
form, as a function of the probability of stimulus values encountered in the
environment. This optimal neural population also imposes limitations on the
ability of the organism to discriminate different values of the encoded
variable. As a result, we predict an explicit relationship between the
statistical properties of the environment, the allocation and selectivity of
neurons within populations, and perceptual discriminability. We test this
relationship for three visual and two auditory attributes, and find that it is

We extend previous work on the problem on three frontiers: (1) We predict new
demographics (age, race, and income) and analyze the most informative apps for
four demographic attributes included in our analysis. The most predictable
attribute is gender (82.3 % accuracy), whereas the hardest to predict is income
(60.3 % accuracy). (2) We compare several dimensionality reduction methods for

superior results compared to aggregating the apps at the app category level,

into the effect of the training set size and the number of apps on the
predictability and show that both of these factors have a large impact on the

do not have an effect on the background metric. We use a variational method,
based on Sturm-Liouville eigenvalue problem for our analytical study, as well
as a numerical shooting method in order to compare with our analytical results.
Interestingly enough, we observe that unlike Born-Infeld-like nonlinear
electrodynamics which decrease the critical temperature compared to the linear
Maxwell field, the Power-Maxwell electrodynamics is able to increase the
critical temperature of the holographic superconductors in the sublinear
regime. We find that requiring the finite value for the gauge field on the
asymptotic boundary $r\rightarrow \infty$, restricts the power parameter, $q$,
of the Power-Maxwell field to be in the range $1/2<q<{(d-1)}/{2}$. Our study
indicates that it is quite possible to make condensation \emph{easier} as $q$
\emph{decreases} in its allowed range. We also find that for all values of $q$,
the condensation can be affected by the Gauss-Bonnet coefficient $\alpha$.
However, the presence of the Gauss-Bonnet term makes the transition slightly
harder. Finally, we obtain an analytic expression for the order parameter and
thus obtain the associated critical exponent near the phase transition. We find
that the critical exponent has its universal value of $\beta=1/2$ regardless of
the parameters $q$, $\alpha$ as well as dimension $d$, consistent with
mean-field values obtained in previous studies.

pebble accretion can reproduce a number of properties of the meteoritic data.
The properties include the present asteroid belt mass, the formation timescale
of chondrules, and the magnetic field strength of the nebula derived from
chondrules in Semarkona. Since this scenario requires a first generation of
planetesimals that trigger impact jetting and serve as parent bodies to accrete
chondrules, the upper limit of parent bodies' masses leads to the following
implications: primordial asteroids that were originally $\ge 10^{24}$ g in mass
were unlikely to contain chondrules, while less massive primordial asteroids
likely had a chondrule-rich surface layer. The scenario developed from impact
jetting and pebble accretion can therefore provide new insights into the

both the linear and nonlinear regimes. The linear growth rate and the
wavenumber are found to scale as $S^{1/4} {\left( {1 + {P_m}} \right)}^{-5/8}$
and $S^{3/8} {\left( {1 + {P_m}} \right)}^{-3/16}$ with respect to the
Lundquist number $S$ and the magnetic Prandtl number $P_m$. Furthermore, the
linear layer width is shown to scale as $S^{-1/8} {(1+P_m)}^{1/16}$. The growth
of the plasmoids slows down from an exponential growth to an algebraic growth
when they enter into the nonlinear regime. In particular, the time-scale of the
nonlinear growth of the plasmoids is found to be $\tau_{NL} \sim S^{-3/16} {(1

radically different from the linear one and it is shown to be essential to
understand the global current sheet disruption. It is also discussed how the
plasmoid instability enables fast magnetic reconnection in visco-resistive
plasmas. In particular, it is shown that the recursive plasmoid formation can
trigger a collisionless reconnection regime if $S \gtrsim L_{cs} {(\epsilon_c

shown to provide coding gain, only disjoint cycles and cliques (a specific type
of overlapping cycles) have been exploited in existing literature. In this
paper, we define a more general form of overlapping cycles, called the
interlinked-cycle (IC) structure, that generalizes cycles and cliques. We
propose a scheme, called the interlinked-cycle-cover (ICC) scheme, that
leverages IC structures in digraphs to construct scalar linear index codes. We
characterize a class of infinitely many digraphs where our proposed scheme is
optimal over all linear and non-linear index codes. Consequently, for this
class of digraphs, we indirectly prove that scalar linear index codes are
optimal. Furthermore, we show that the ICC scheme can outperform all existing
graph-based schemes (including partial-clique-cover and
fractional-local-chromatic number schemes), and a random-coding scheme (namely,
composite coding) for certain graphs.

the Faddeev equations in momentum space and express the mean-square radii in
terms of first-order derivatives of the Fourier transforms of densities. The
strengths of the interactions are adjusted for each set of masses to produce
equal two-body bound-state energies between different pairs. The mass ratio,
${\cal A}=m_B/m_A$, between particles $B$ and $A$ are varied from $0.01$ to
$100$ providing a number of bound states decreasing from $8$ to $2$. Energies
and mean-square radii of these states are analyzed for small ${\cal A}$ by use
of the Born-Oppenheimer potential between the two heavy $A$-particles. For
large ${\cal A}$ the radii of the two bound states are consistent with a
slightly asymmetric three-body structure. When ${\cal A}$ approaches thresholds
for binding of the three-body excited states, the corresponding mean-square
radii diverge inversely proportional to the deviation of the three-body energy
from the two-body thresholds. The structures at these three-body thresholds
correspond to bound $AB$-dimers and one loosely bound $A$-particle.

introduces the anisotropic property to the measured density power spectrum in

formula is intrinsically non-linear, which is complicated by the higher order
polynomials due to indefinite cross correlations between the density and
velocity fields, and the Finger-of-God effect due to the randomness of the
peculiar velocity field. Whilst the full higher order polynomials remain
unknown, the other systematics can be controlled consistently within the same
order truncation in the expansion of the mapping formula, as shown in this
paper. The systematic due to the unknown non-linear density and velocity fields
is removed by separately measuring all terms in the expansion directly using
simulations. The uncertainty caused by the velocity randomness is controlled by
splitting the FoG term into two pieces, 1) the ""one-point"" FoG term being
independent of the separation vector between two different points, and 2) the

transmit power and maximizing packet delivery ratio (PDR), with respect to D2D

selects its satisfaction with the social welfare of the D2D followers by
considering the reaction of the followers to the price it charges. All
followers (D2D pairs) select transmit power so as to guarantee a desired
quality-of-experience (QoE), where each follower enacts one of three possible
behaviors: (i) casual; (ii) intermediate; or (iii) serious. Analysis shows that
there exists a sub-game perfect Stackelberg Equilibrium across all players.
Analysis and simulation demonstrates that the BS leader rapidly converges to an
optimal satisfaction while guaranteeing social welfare across D2D users, and
all D2D followers then rapidly converge to a Pareto-efficient outcome with
respect to transmit power and PDR.

model, in which an even number of magnetic flux quanta are attached to an
electron and where states form the sequence of filling factors $\nu = p/(2mp

system, the CF picture is thought to become unstable for the $N \geq 2$ LL,
where larger residual interactions between CFs are predicted and competing
many-body phases have been observed. Here we report transport measurements of
FQH states in the $N=2$ LL (filling factors $4 < \nu < 8$) in bilayer graphene,
a system with spin and valley degrees of freedom in all LLs, and an additional
orbital degeneracy in the 8-fold degenerate $N=0$/$N=1$ LLs. In contrast with
recent observations of particle-hole asymmetry in the $N=0$/$N=1$ LLs of
bilayer graphene, the FQH states we observe in the $N=2$ LL are consistent with
the CF model: within a LL, they form a complete sequence of particle-hole
symmetric states whose relative strength is dependent on their denominators.
The FQH states in the $N=2$ LL display energy gaps of a few Kelvin, comparable
to and in some cases larger than those of fractional states in the $N=0$/$N=1$

of cosmological solutions in the FRW universe can be obtained. A detailed
analysis is given of the meaning of the BRST transformations, which make the
induced gravity be a topological field theory, by means of the canonical
quantization analysis, and the physical reason why such BRST transformations
are needed in the present formalism is clarified. Finally, we propose a
dynamical mechanism for fixing the Lagrange multiplier fields by following the
Higgs mechanism. The present study clearly indicates that the induced gravity
can be constructed at the classical level without recourse to quantum
fluctuations of matter and suggests an interesting relationship between the
induced gravity and the topological quantum field theory.

  External Electrical Fields",,,,,"math.DS","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  An optimal control strategy is developed to construct nanostructures of
desired geometry along line segments by means of directed self-assembly of
charged particles. Such a control strategy determines the electric potentials
of a set of electrodes located at fixed points in the line segment. The
particles move under the electric forces generated by these electrodes and by
the interactions between the particles themselves to form a desired pattern
eventually. Due to technology limitations, the particle positions cannot be
measured during the course of control, so that the control is open-loop in
nature. Such an open-loop control optimally changes the electrode potentials in
time in order to create a desired pattern with the highest probability, despite
the inherent uncertainty in the initial positions and the dynamical behaviors
of the particles. Two models are proposed to describe the uncertain dynamics of
the particles: a continuous model relying on a set of nonlinear stochastic
differential equations, and a discrete Ising model consisting of a large
dimensional continuous-time Markov chain. While the first model is more
mathematically tractable, the second one more precisely describes particles at
the nanometer scale. The control design procedure begins with the continuous
model and identifies the structure of its stable equilibria, which is used
later to propose a piecewise constant structure for the control and to
demonstrate that the optimal value of each piece is independently obtained from
a certain static optimization problem. It is shown next that the design
procedure can be applied to the discrete model with only minor modifications. A
numerical example of control design is presented.

natural zero-sum games have exponentially many strategies, but highly
structured payoffs. For example, in the well-studied Colonel Blotto game
(introduced by Borel in 1921), players must divide a pool of troops among a set
of battlefields with the goal of winning (i.e., having more troops in) a
majority. The Colonel Blotto game is commonly used for analyzing a wide range
of applications from the U.S presidential election, to innovative technology
competitions, to advertisement, to sports. However, because of the size of the
strategy space, standard methods for computing equilibria of zero-sum games
fail to be computationally feasible. Indeed, despite its importance, only a few
solutions for special variants of the problem are known.
  In this paper we show how to compute equilibria of Colonel Blotto games.
  Moreover, our approach takes the form of a general reduction: to find a Nash
equilibrium of a zero-sum game, it suffices to design a separation oracle for
the strategy polytope of any bilinear game that is payoff-equivalent. We then
apply this technique to obtain the first polytime algorithms for a variety of
games. In addition to Colonel Blotto, we also show how to compute equilibria in
an infinite-strategy variant called the General Lotto game; this involves
showing how to prune the strategy space to a finite subset before applying our
reduction. We also consider the class of dueling games, first introduced by
Immorlica et al. (2011). We show that our approach provably extends the class
of dueling games for which equilibria can be computed: we introduce a new
dueling game, the matching duel, on which prior methods fail to be
computationally feasible but upon which our reduction can be applied.

a way to enhance the total probability of antenna-photon scattering, we extend
the model to the case of multiple molecules. In general, the presence of more
than one molecule decreases the up-conversion probability because they equally
share the energy of the two photons. However, it is shown that we can overcome
the difficulty by controlling the inter-molecule coupling. Our result implies
that, without increasing the incident photon number (light power), we can
enlarge the net probability of the two-photon up-conversion.

integrates HOG+LUV with each layer of CNN into a multi-layer image channels.
Based on the multi-layer image channels, a multi-stage cascade AdaBoost is then

learned from the image channels of corresponding layer. With more abundant

is 5 or 7). Generally, the size of the filter is equal to the size $ H\times W

strategy is not strong enough. To overcome the drawback, we propose to use
subpatch filter whose spatial size $ h\times w $ is smaller than $ H\times W $.
The proposed subpatch filter consists of two subsequent filters. The first one
is a linear filter of spatial size $ h\times w $ and is aimed at extracting
features from spatial domain. The second one is of spatial size $ 1\times 1 $
and is used for strengthening the connection between different input feature
channels and for reducing the number of parameters. The subpatch filter
convolves with the input patch and the resulting network is called a subpatch
network. Taking the output of one subpatch network as input, we further repeat
constructing subpatch networks until the output contains only one neuron in
spatial domain. These subpatch networks form a new network called Cascaded
Subpatch Network (CSNet). The feature layer generated by CSNet is called csconv
layer. For the whole input image, we construct a deep neural network by
stacking a sequence of csconv layers. Experimental results on four benchmark
datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and compactness of the proposed CSNet.
For example, our CSNet reaches a test error of $ 5.68\% $ on the CIFAR10
dataset without model averaging. To the best of our knowledge, this is the best
result ever obtained on the CIFAR10 dataset.

visual tracking, which is based on paced updates and trajectory selection.
Given a base tracker, an ensemble of trackers is generated, in which each
tracker's update behavior will be paced and then traces the target object
forward and backward to generate a pair of trajectories in an interval. Then,
we implicitly perform self-examination based on trajectory pair of each tracker

the QSO SDSS J125942.80+121312.6, based on the optical and near-infrared
spectra taken from the SDSS-I, SDSS-III Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey
(BOSS), and TripleSpec observations over a timescale of 5.8 years in the QSO's
rest-frame. The blueshifted absorption profile of H$\beta$ shows a variation of
more than 5$\sigma$ at a high velocity portion ($>3000\ \mathrm{km\ s}^{-1}$)
of the trough. We perform a detailed analysis for the physical conditions of
the absorber using Balmer lines as well as metastable He I and optical Fe II
absorptions ($\lambda 4233$ from b$^4$P$_{5/2}$ level and $\lambda 5169$ from
a$^6$S$_{5/2}$) at the same velocity. These Fe II lines are identified in the
QSO spectra for the first time. According to the photoionization simulations,
we estimate a gas density of $n(\mathrm{H})\approx 10^{9.1}\ \mathrm{cm}^{-3}$
and a column density of $N_{\mathrm{col}}(\mathrm{H})\approx 10^{23}\
\mathrm{cm}^{-2}$ for the BOSS data, but the model fails to predict the
variations of ionic column densities between the SDSS and BOSS observations if
changes in ionizing flux are assumed. We thus propose transverse motion of the
absorbing gas being the cause of the observed broad Balmer absorption line
variability. In fact, we find that the changes in covering factors of the
absorber can well-reproduce all of the observed variations. The absorber is
estimated $\sim 0.94$ pc away from the central engine, which is where the
outflow likely experiences deceleration due to the collision with the
surrounding medium. This scheme is consistent with the argument that LoBAL QSOs
may represent the transition from obscured star-forming galaxies to classic
QSOs.

identified by Strader et al. The existence of radio pulsations implies that the
neutron star is currently not accreting. Substantial outflows from the
companion render the radio pulsar undetectable for more than half of the orbit,
and may contribute to the observed Halpha emission. Our initial pulsar
observations, together with the optically inferred orbit and inclination, imply
a mass ratio of 0.171+/-0.002, a companion mass of M_2=0.33+/-0.03 Msun, and a
neutron star mass in the range 1.77<M_1<2.13 Msun. However, there remains a
discrepancy between the distance of 4.4 kpc inferred from the optical
properties of the companion and the smaller radio dispersion measure distance
of 1.6 kpc. The smaller distance would reduce the inferred Roche-lobe filling
factor, increase the inferred inclination angle, and decrease the masses. As a
wide binary, PSR J1417-4402 differs from the radio-eclipsing black widow and
redback pulsars being discovered in large numbers by Fermi. It is probably a
system that began mass transfer onto the neutron star after the companion star
left the main sequence. The companion should end its evolution as a He white

mobile telco networks, where the CDRs derived relationship are of less social

that the stronger ties that users build, the more similarity between their

However, so far, no rigorous mathematical analysis has been given to the

the possibility to analyze the confinement behavior of an electron executing

these issues in the world of arithmetic circuits. Specifically, it is known
that convolutional arithmetic circuits possess the property of ""complete depth

implemented by a deep network of polynomial size, require exponential size in
order to be implemented (or even approximated) by a shallow network. In this

convolutional rectifier networks than it is with convolutional arithmetic

great interest in Nuclear Physics. In this context, two-fluid algebraic models
are ideal systems to study how the concept of quantum phase transition evolves
when moving into more complex systems, but the number of publications along
this line has been scarce up to now.
  Purpose: We intend to determine the phase diagram of a two-fluid Lipkin
model, that resembles the nuclear proton-neutron interacting boson model
Hamiltonian, using both numerical results and analytic tools, i.e., catastrophe
theory, and to compare the mean-field results with exact diagonalizations for
large systems. Method: The mean-field energy surface of a consistent-Q-like
two-fluid Lipkin Hamiltonian is studied and compared with exact results coming
from a direct diagonalization. The mean-field results are analyzed using the
framework of catastrophe theory.
  Results: The phase diagram of the model is obtained and the order of the
different phase-transition lines and surfaces is determined using a catastrophe
theory analysis.
  Conclusions: There are two first order surfaces in the phase diagram, one
separating the spherical and the deformed shapes, while the other separates two
different deformed phases. A second order line, where the later surfaces merge,
is found. This line finishes in a transition point with a divergence in the
second order derivative of the energy that corresponds to a tricritical point
in the language of the Ginzburg-Landau theory for phase transitions.

due to the reprocessing of a lamp located on the black hole axis, emitting
X-rays. The observed spectrum is made of 3 components: the direct spectrum; the
thermal bump; and the reflected spectrum made of the Compton hump and the
iron-line complex.
  Aims. We aim at computing accurately the complete reprocessed spectrum
(thermal bump + reflected) of black-hole binaries over the entire X-ray band.
We also determine the strength of the direct component. Our choice of
parameters is adapted to a source showing an important thermal component.
  Methods. We compute in full GR the illumination of a thin disk by a lamp
along the rotation axis. We use the ATM21 radiative transfer code to compute
the spectrum emitted along the disk. We ray trace this local spectrum to
determine the reprocessed spectrum as observed at infinity. We discuss the
dependence of the local and ray-traced spectra on the emission angle and spin.
  Results. We show the importance of the angle dependence of the total disk
specific intensity spectrum emitted by the illuminated atmosphere when the
thermal disk emission if fully taken into account. High spin implies high
temperature in the inner regions, so the emitted thermal disk spectrum covers
the iron-line complex. As a result we locally observe absorption lines produced
in the hot disk atmosphere. Absorption lines are narrow and disappear after ray
tracing the local spectrum.
  Conclusions. Our results mainly highlight the importance of considering the
angle dependence of the local spectrum when computing reprocessed spectra, as
was already found in a recent study. The main new result of our work is to show
the importance of computing the thermal bump of the spectrum, as this feature
can change considerably the observed iron-line complex.

densities in such structures yield higher exciton radiative efficiency, thus
limiting nonradiative losses of propagating excitons. Second, the absence of
the dielectric mismatch between the substrate and the epilayer strongly limits
the photon guiding effect in the plane of the structure,making exciton
transport easier to distinguish from photon propagation. Our results pave the

single active particles, covering the Stokes equation and the Scallop Theorem,
and stressing the link between autonomous activity and the dipolar symmetry of
the far flow field. In lecture 2 I discuss applications of this mathematics to
the behaviour of microswimmers at surfaces and in external flows, and describe
our current understanding of how swimmers stir the surrounding fluid. Lecture 3
concentrates on the collective behaviour of active particles, modelled as an
active nematic. I write down the equations of motion and motivate the form of
the active stress. The resulting hydrodynamic instability leads to a state
termed active turbulence characterised by strong jets and vortices in the flow
field and the continual creation and annihilation of pairs of topological
defects. Lecture 4 compares simulations of active turbulence to experiments on

is an increasingly popular strategy to investigate temporal dynamics of the
brain's large-scale network architecture. Current practice when deriving
connectivity estimates over time is to use the Fisher transform which aims to
stabilize the variance of correlation values that fluctuate around varying true
correlation values. It is however unclear how well the stabilization of signal
variance performed by the Fisher transform works for each connectivity time
series, when the true correlation is assumed to be fluctuating. This is of
importance because many subsequent analyses either assume or perform better
when the time series have stable variance or adheres to an approximate Gaussian
distribution. In this paper, using simulations and analysis of resting-state
fMRI data, we analyze the effect of applying different variance stabilization
strategies on connectivity time-series. We here focus our investigation on the
Fisher transform, the Box Cox transform and an approach that combines both
transforms. Our results show that, if the intention of stabilizing the variance
is to use metrics on the time series where stable variance or a Gaussian
distribution is desired (e.g. clustering), the Fisher transform is not optimal
and may even skew connectivity time series away from being Gaussian. Further,
we show that the suboptimal performance of the Fisher transform can be
substantially improved by including an additional Box-Cox transformation after
the dFC time series has been Fisher transformed.

outbursts were performed with Chandra in 2004 and Swift in 2013. XMM-Newton
observed its quiescent state in 2004. In addition, when Suzaku observed it in
2009 as a part of Galactic center mapping observations, GRS 1747$-$312 was
found to be in a low luminosity state with $L_{\rm x} \sim 1.2 \times 10^{35}$
erg s$^{-1}$. All of the observations except for XMM-Newton included the time
of the eclipses predicted. We analyzed archival data of these observations.
During the Chandra and Swift observations, we found clear flux decreases at the
expected time of the eclipses. During the Suzaku observation, however, there
were no clear signs for the predicted eclipses. The lapse of the predicted
eclipses during the Suzaku observation can be explained by a contaminant source
quite close to GRS 1747$-$312. When GRS 1747$-$312 is in the quiescent state,
we observe X-rays from the contaminant source rather than from GRS 1747$-$312.
However, we have no clear evidence for the contaminant source in our data. The
lapse might also be explained by thick material ($N_{\rm H} > 10^{24}$

of the thick material is not clear.

barriers when compared to their transitional counterparts, namely to support
significantly higher data rates, have long-lasting energy supplies and remain
fully operational in interference-limited heterogeneous networks. This could be
partially achieved by providing three promising features, which are radio
frequency (RF) energy harvesting, improper Gaussian signaling and operating in
full-duplex communication mode, i.e., transmit and receive at the same time
within the same frequency band. In this paper, we consider these aspects
jointly in a multi-antenna heterogeneous two-tier network. In this network, the
users in the femto- cell are sharing the scarce resources with the cellular
users in the macro-cell and have to cope with the interference from the
macro-cell base station as well as the transmitter noise and residual self-
interference (RSI) due to imperfect full-duplex operation. Interestingly
enough, while these impairments are detrimental from the achievable rate
perspective, they are beneficial from the energy harvesting aspect as they
carry RF energy. In this paper, we consider this natural trade-off jointly and
propose appropriate optimization problems for beamforming and optimal resource
allocation. Moreover, various receiver structures are employed for both
information detection (ID) and energy harvesting (EH) capabilities. The paper
aims at characterizing the trade-off between the achievable rates and harvested
energies. Rate and energy maximization problems are thoroughly investigated.
Finally, the numerical illustrations demonstrate the impact of energy
harvesting on the achievable rate performance.

synchronization, in which the goal is to recover a collection of phases using
noisy measurements of relative phases. It is known that in the Gaussian noise
setting, the maximum likelihood estimator (MLE) has an expected squared
$\ell_2$-estimation error that is on the same order as the Cram\'er-Rao lower
bound. Moreover, even though the MLE is an optimal solution to a non-convex
quadratic optimization problem, it can be found with high probability using
semidefinite programming (SDP), provided that the noise power is not too large.
In this paper, we study the estimation and convergence performance of a
recently-proposed low-complexity alternative to the SDP-based approach, namely,
the generalized power method (GPM). Our contribution is twofold. First, we
bound the rate at which the estimation error decreases in each iteration of the
GPM and use this bound to show that all iterates---not just the MLE---achieve
an estimation error that is on the same order as the Cram\'er-Rao bound. Our
result holds under the least restrictive assumption on the noise power and
gives the best provable bound on the estimation error known to date. It also
implies that one can terminate the GPM at any iteration and still obtain an
estimator that has a theoretical guarantee on its estimation error. Second, we
show that under the same assumption on the noise power as that for the
SDP-based method, the GPM will converge to the MLE at a linear rate with high
probability. This answers a question raised in [3] and shows that the GPM is
competitive in terms of both theoretical guarantees and numerical efficiency
with the SDP-based method. At the heart of our convergence rate analysis is a
new error bound for the non-convex quadratic optimization formulation of the
phase synchronization problem, which could be of independent interest.

$N_\text{A}$, $N_\text{B}$ denote the number of carbon atoms in each
sublattice. In this work, we establish a stronger relation that is valid in the
thermodynamic limit and that involves the concentration of zero-modes:
$n_\text{zm}>|c_\text{A}-c_\text{B}|$, where $c_\text{A}$ and $c_\text{B}$
denote the concentration of vacancies per sublattice; in particular,
$n_\text{zm}$ is non-vanishing even in the case of balanced disorder,
$N_\text{A}/N_\text{B}=1$. Adopting terminology from benzoid graph theory, the
excess modes associated with the current carrying backbone (percolation
cluster) are called supernumerary. In the simplest cases such modes can be
associated with structural elements of internal boundaries like dangling bonds.
Our result suggest that the continuum limit of bipartite hopping models
supports nontrivial ""supernumerary"" terms that escape the present continuum
descriptions.

closing a long line of work on this problem. For a stream of $m$ items in $\{1,
2, \dots, n\}$ and parameters $0 < \epsilon < \phi \leq 1$, let $f_i$ denote
the frequency of item $i$, i.e., the number of times item $i$ occurs in the

items $i$ for which $f_i \geq \phi m$, returns no items $j$ for which $f_j \leq
(\phi -\epsilon)m$, and returns approximations $\tilde{f}_i$ with $|\tilde{f}_i

$O(\epsilon^{-1} \log\phi^{-1} + \phi^{-1} \log n + \log \log m)$ bits of

its output in time linear in the output size. We also prove a lower bound,
which implies that our algorithm is optimal up to a constant factor in its
space complexity. A modification of our algorithm can be used to estimate the
maximum frequency up to an additive $\epsilon m$ error in the above amount of
space, resolving Question 3 in the IITK 2006 Workshop on Algorithms for Data
Streams for the case of $\ell_1$-heavy hitters. We also introduce several
variants of the heavy hitters and maximum frequency problems, inspired by rank
aggregation and voting schemes, and show how our techniques can be applied in
such settings. Unlike the traditional heavy hitters problem, some of these

the well known primary explosives Silver Fulminate (SF), silver azide and lead
azide. MF exhibits anisotropic compressibility (b>a>c) under pressure,
consequently the corresponding elastic moduli decrease in the following order:
C22>C11>C33. The structural and mechanical properties suggest that MF is more
sensitive to detonate along c-axis (similar to RDX) due to high compressibility
of Hg...O non-bonded interactions along that axis. Electronic structure and
optical properties were calculated including spin-orbit (SO) interactions using
full potential linearized augmented plane wave method within recently developed
Tran-Blaha modified Becke-Johnson (TB-mBJ) potential. The calculated TB-mBJ
electronic structures of SF and MF show that these compounds are indirect
bandgap insulators. Also, SO coupling is found to be more pronounced for 4d and
5d-states of Ag and Hg atoms of SF and MF, respectively. Partial density of
states and electron charge density maps were used to describe the nature of
chemical bonding. Ag-C bond is more directional than Hg-C bond which makes SF
to be more unstable than MF. The effect of SO coupling on optical properties
has also been studied and found to be significant for both of the compounds.

highly complex, posing significant flight control and stability challenges.
Unsteady airflows can range from structured chains of discrete vortices shed in
the wake of an object to fully developed chaotic turbulence. It is critical to
understand the flight control strategies insects employ to safely navigate in
natural environments. We combined experiments on free flying bumblebees with
high fidelity numerical simulations and lower order modeling to identify the
salient mechanics that mediate insect flight in unsteady winds. We trained
bumblebees to fly upwind towards an artificial flower in a wind tunnel under
steady wind and in a von Karman street (23Hz) formed in the wake of a cylinder.
The bees displayed significantly higher movement in the unsteady vortex street
compared to steady winds. Correlation analysis revealed that at lower
frequencies, less than 10 Hz, in both steady and unsteady winds the bees
mediated lateral movement with body roll, typical casting motion. At higher
frequencies in unsteady winds there was a negative correlation between body
roll and lateral accelerations. Numerical simulations of a bumblebee in similar
conditions permitted the separation of the passive and active components of the
flight trajectories. Comparison between the free-flying and numerical bees
revealed a novel mechanism that enables bees to passively ride out high
frequency perturbations while performing active maneuvers and corrections at
lower frequencies. The capacity of maintaining stability by combining passive
and active modes at different timescales provides a viable means for volant
animals and machines to tackle the control challenges posed by complex
airflows.

describing the mean-field Lagrangian, density, we adopt the TMA parameter set,
which is remarkably consistent with with the updated astrophysical observations
of neutron stars. Due to the importance of the density dependence of the
symmetry energy, $S$, in nuclear astrophysics, a brief discussion on the
symmetry parameters $S_v$ and $L$ (the slope of $S$) is presented. Combining
these fit formulae with boundary conditions for different density regions, we
can evaluate the value of $E_{\rm F}(e)$ in any given matter density, and
obtain a schematic diagram of $E_{\rm F}(e)$ as a continuous function of
$\rho$. Compared with previous study on the electron Fermi energy in other
models, our methods of calculating $E_{\rm F}(e)$ are more simple and
convenient, and can be universally suitable for the relativistic electron
regions in the circumstances of common neutron stars. We have deduced a general
expression of $E_{\rm F}(e)$ and $n_{e}$, which could be used to indirectly
test whether one EoS of a NS is correct in our future studies on neutron star
matter properties. Since URCA reactions are expected in the center of a massive

sources with counterparts at other wavelengths, about 40% of the LAT sources
have no a clear identification remaining ""unassociated"". The purpose of my
Ph.D. work has been to pursue a statistical approach to identify the nature of
each Fermi-LAT unassociated source. To this aim, we implemented advanced
machine learning techniques, such as logistic regression and artificial neural
networks, to classify these sources on the basis of all the available gamma-ray
information about location, energy spectrum and time variability. These
analyses have been used for selecting targets for AGN and pulsar searches and
planning multi-wavelength follow-up observations. In particular, we have
focused our attention on the search of possible radio-quiet millisecond pulsar
(MSP) candidates in the sample of the Fermi-LAT unidentified sources. These
objects have not yet been detected but their discovery would have a formidable
impact for our understanding of the MSP gamma-ray emission mechanism.

  Spallation Source",,,,,"physics.ins-det","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  This artcile presents an optimisation of performance and cost of neutron
scattering instrumentation at the European Spallation Source. This is done by
trading detailed cost functions against beam transmission functions in a
multi-dimensional, yet simple, parameter space. On the one hand, the neutron
guide cost increases as a power of the desired beam divergence, and inversely
with the minimum wavelength, due to the supermirror coating needed. On the
other hand, the more neutrons are transported to the instrument the greater are
the shielding costs to deal with the gamma rays that result from the eventual
absorption of the neutrons. There are additional factors in that many of the
parameters defining the neutron guide geometry are continuous variables, and
the straightness of the guide increases the transmission of high energy
spallation products, which affect the specifications of particularly heavy
hardware, such as heavy shutters and additional shielding, beam stops etc. Over
the suite of 16 instruments, a maximum potential cost saving is identified in
the vicinity of 20 M\euro \,, with negligible penalties on instrument
performance and bandwidth, by trading minimum neutron wavelength $\lambda$
against total optical costs and shielding costs. Finally, these cost
calculations are shown to be consistent with those at real world, existing
spallation source facilities.

the sparsity structure may differ between two sub-populations. We develop
$\ell_1$-penalized estimators of both regression coefficients and the threshold
parameter. Our penalized estimators not only select covariates but also
discriminate between a model with homogeneous sparsity and a model with a
change point. As a result, it is not necessary to know or pretest whether the
change point is present, or where it occurs. Our estimator of the change point
achieves an oracle property in the sense that its asymptotic distribution is
the same as if the unknown active sets of regression coefficients were known.
Importantly, we establish this oracle property without a perfect covariate
selection, thereby avoiding the need for the minimum level condition on the
signals of active covariates. Dealing with high-dimensional quantile regression
with an unknown change point calls for a new proof technique since the quantile
loss function is non-smooth and furthermore the corresponding objective
function is non-convex with respect to the change point. The technique
developed in this paper is applicable to a general M-estimation framework with
a change point, which may be of independent interest. The proposed methods are
then illustrated via Monte Carlo experiments and an application to tipping in
the dynamics of racial segregation.

occur around 5.6 GPa along with a large volume collapse of 16.6$\%$, which is
consistent with previously reported experimental data. This transformation also
leads to an increase in the coordination number of vanadium atom from 4 to 6.
The computed equilibrium and high pressure structural properties of both
InVO$_4$ phases, including unit cell parameters, equation of state, and bulk
moduli, are in good agreement with the available experimental data. In
addition, compressibility is found to be highly anisotropic and the
\emph{b}-axis being more compressible than the other for both the structures.
Electronic band structures for both the phases were calculated, and the band
gap for orthorhombic and monoclinic InVO$_4$ are found to be 4.02 and 1.67 eV,
respectively, within the Tran-Blaha Modified Becke-Johnson potential as
implemented in linearized augmented planewave method. We further examined the
optical properties such as dielectric function, refractive index, and
absorption spectra for both the structures. From the implications of these
results, it can be proposed that the high pressure InVO$_4$ phase can be more
useful than orthorhombic phase for photo catalytic applications.

$3$-nets (embedded) in a projective plane $PG(2,K)$, defined over a field $K$

find $3$-nets in $PG(2,K)$ as far as $0<p\le n$. However, only a few infinite

$3$-nets in $PG(2,K)$ which can be coordinatized by a diassociative loop $G$

nature of user terminals (UTs). In this paper, we propose an incentive
mechanism in which the base station (BS) rewards those UTs that share contents
with others using D2D communication. We study the cost minimization problem for
the BS and the utility maximization problem for each UT. In particular, the BS
determines the rewarding policy to minimize his total cost, while each UT aims
to maximize his utility by choosing his caching policy. We formulate the
conflict among UTs and the tension between the BS and the UTs as a Stackelberg
game. We show the existence of the equilibrium and propose an iterative
gradient algorithm (IGA) to obtain the Stackelberg Equilibrium. Extensive
simulations are carried out to evaluate the performance of the proposed caching
scheme and comparisons are drawn with several baseline caching schemes with no
incentives. Numerical results show that the caching scheme under our incentive
mechanism outperforms other schemes in terms of the BS serving cost and the

the electric vector position angle (EVPA) of linearly polarized optical
emission from blazars have been reported. These events are often coincident
with high energy gamma-ray flares and they have attracted considerable
attention, as they could allow one to probe the magnetic field structure in the
gamma-ray emitting region of the jet. The flat-spectrum radio quasar 3C279 is
one of the most prominent examples showing this behaviour. Our goal is to study
the observed EVPA rotations and to distinguish between a stochastic and a
deterministic origin of the polarization variability. We have combined multiple
data sets of R-band photometry and optical polarimetry measurements of 3C279,
yielding exceptionally well-sampled flux density and polarization curves that
cover a period of 2008-2012. Several large EVPA rotations are identified in the
data. We introduce a quantitative measure for the EVPA curve smoothness, which
is then used to test a set of simple random walk polarization variability
models against the data. 3C279 shows different polarization variation
characteristics during an optical low-flux state and a flaring state. The
polarization variation during the flaring state, especially the smooth approx.
360 degrees rotation of the EVPA in mid-2011, is not consistent with the tested
stochastic processes. We conclude that during the two different optical flux
states, two different processes govern the polarization variation, possibly a
stochastic process during the low-brightness state and a deterministic process
during the flaring activity.

functional that corresponds to the degree distribution variance, Markov chain

the spectra of the adja cency and the Laplacian matrix as well as the algebraic

spectral properties with well-known random graph models. In the microcanonical
ensemble analytical approximations agree with numerical simulations. In the
canonical ensemble a crossover behaviour can be found for the algebraic

small-world behavior in one model. The considered spectral properties can be
applied to transport problems on triangulation graphs and the crossover

the violation of Bell-type inequalities does not allow concluding that Nature
is nonlocal and that quantum theory is complete thus the Bohr-Einstein quantum
debate may not be closed. The continuation of this debate is not only important
for a better understanding of Nature but also for various practical

Polarimetric observations of Bok globules frequently show a decrease
in the degree of polarization towards their central dense regions (polarization
holes). This behaviour is usually explained with increased disalignment owing
to high density and temperature, or insufficient angular resolution of a
possibly complex magnetic field structure.
  Aims. We investigate whether a significant decrease in polarized emission of
dense regions in Bok globules is possible under certain physical conditions.
For instance, we evaluate the impact of optical depth effects and various
properties of the dust phase.
  Methods. We use radiative transfer modelling to calculate the temperature
structure of an analytical Bok globule model and simulate the polarized thermal
emission of elongated dust grains. For the alignment of the dust grains, we
consider a magnetic field and include radiative torque and internal alignment.
  Results. Besides the usual explanations, selected conditions of the
temperature and density distribution, the dust phase and the magnetic field are
also able to significantly decrease the polarized emission of dense regions in
Bok globules. Taking submm/mm grains and typical column densities of existing
Bok globules into consideration, the optical depth is high enough to decrease
the degree of polarization by up to {\Delta}P~10%. If limited to the densest
regions, dust grain growth to submm/mm size and accumulated graphite grains
decrease the degree of polarization by up to {\Delta}P~10% and {\Delta}P~5%,
respectively. However, the effect of the graphite grains occurs only if they do
not align with the magnetic field.

energy contribution taking account of the Burgers vector through a dependence
only on the dislocation density tensor Curl(p) giving rise to a non-symmetric
nonlocal backstress, and isotropic hardening response only depending on the
accumulated equivalent plastic strain. The model is fully isotropic and
satisfies linearized gauge-invariance conditions, i.e., only true
state-variables appear. The model satisfies also the principle of maximum
dissipation which allows to show existence for the weak formulation. For this
result, a recently introduced Korn's inequality for incompatible tensor fields
is necessary. Uniqueness is shown in the class of strong solutions. For
vanishing energetic length scale, the model reduces to classical
elasto-plasticity with symmetric plastic strain sym(p) and standard isotropic

the PL intensity drops drastically with a decay time in the range of the
picosecond driven by the escape of excitons from the radiative window due to
exciton- phonon interactions. Following this first non-thermal regime, a
thermalized exciton population is established gradually yielding longer
photoluminescence decay times in the nanosecond range. Both the exciton
effective radiative recombination and non-radiative recombination channels

that the two populations are not in thermodynamical equilibrium.

topological surface states known as 'Fermi arcs' [1-3]. The formation of these
states is guaranteed by the existence of bulk Weyl points with opposite
chirality. Tantalum Arsenide (TaAs) [4-9], a member of the newly discovered
family of Weyl semi-metals [4,5], harbors a host of non-topological ('trivial')
surface states overlapping in energy with the predicted 12 'Fermi arcs'. This
overlap poses a major challenge in identifying the signatures of the arcs [10].
Here we harness the inherently distinct spatial structure of trivial and Fermi
arc states to visualize the Fermi arcs for the first time using scanning
tunneling microscopy. We do so in four distinct ways, each of which highlights
a different aspect of their unusual nature. We reveal their relatively
isotropic scattering signature, their energy dispersion and its relation to the
bulk Weyl points, their deep bulk penetration relative to that of
non-topological surface states and their weak coupling to the atomic structure.
The latter is obtained by accounting for the spatial structure of the Bloch
wavefunction and its effect on the scattering properties of the electrons off
lattice defects in general. It thus provides a novel analysis tool for the
spectroscopic characterization of electronic wavefunctions using scanning

recurrent nova T Pyxidis, using the global telescope network of the Center for
Backyard Astrophysics. During 1996-2011, that wave was highly stable in
amplitude and waveform, resembling the orbital wave commonly seen in supersoft
binaries. The period, however, was found to increase on a timescale
P/P-dot=3x10^5 years. This suggests a mass transfer rate in quiescence of
~10^-7 M_sol/yr, in substantial agreement with the accretion rate based on the
star's luminosity. This is ~2000x greater than is typical for cataclysmic
variables of that orbital period. During the post-eruption quiescence
(2012-2016), the star continued on its merry but mysterious way - similar
luminosity, similar P/P-dot (2.4x10^5 years).
  The orbital signal became vanishingly weak (<0.003 mag) near maximum light of
the 2011 eruption. By day 170 of the eruption, near V=11, the orbital signal
reappeared with an amplitude of 0.005 mag. It then gradually strengthened to
its normal 0.08 mag amplitude, as the star declined to its ""quiescent""
magnitude of 15.7. During the ~1 year of invisibility and low amplitude, the
orbital signal had increased in period by 0.0054(7)%. This is probably a
measure of the mass ejected in the nova outburst. For a plausible choice of
binary parameters, that mass is at least 3x10^-5 M_sol, and probably more. This
represents >300 years of accretion at the pre-outburst rate, but the time
between outbursts was only 45 years. Thus the erupting white dwarf seems to
have ejected at least 6x more mass than it accreted. If this eruption is
typical, the white dwarf must be eroding, rather than growing, in mass. Unless
the present series of eruptions is a short-lived episode, the binary dynamics
appear to be a mutual suicide pact between the eroding white dwarf and the
low-mass secondary, excited ... . (etc., abstract continues)

models predict the production of high energy photons by non-thermal radiative
processes, but their efficiency is still debated. We aim to test and explain
the possibility of emission from the bow shocks formed by runaway stars
traveling through the interstellar medium by using previous theoretical models.
We apply our model to AE Aurigae, the first reported star with an X-ray
detected bow shock, to BD+43 3654, in which the observations failed in
detecting high energy emission, and to the transition phase of a supergiant
star in the late stages of its life.From our analysis, we confirm that the
X-ray emission from the bow shock produced by AE Aurigae can be explained by
inverse Compton processes involving the infrared photons of the heated dust. We
also predict low high energy flux emission from the bow shock produced by BD+43
3654, and the possibility of high energy emission from the bow shock formed by
a supergiant star during the transition phase from blue to red supergiant.Bow
shock formed by different type of runaway stars are revealed as a new possible

have bounded chromatic number if and only if H is acyclic. Here we consider
ordered graphs, i.e., graphs with a linear ordering on their vertex set, and
the function f(H) = sup{chi(G) | G in Forb(H)} where Forb(H) denotes the set of
all ordered graphs that do not contain a copy of H. If H contains a cycle, then
as in the case of unordered graphs, f(H) is infinity. However, in contrast to
the unordered graphs, we describe an infinite family of ordered forests H with
infinite f(H). An ordered graph is crossing if there are two edges uv and u'v'
with u < u' < v < v'. For connected crossing ordered graphs H we reduce the
problem of determining whether f(H) is finite to a family of so-called
monotonically alternating trees. For non-crossing H we prove that f(H) is
finite if and only if H is acyclic and does not contain a copy of any of the
five special ordered forests on four or five vertices, which we call bonnets.
For such forests H, we show that f(H) <= 2^|V(H)| and that f(H) <= 2|V(H)|-3 if

unpolarized and polarized electron scattering experiments show a significant
disagreement that grows with the squared four momentum transfer ($Q^{2}$).
Calculations have shown that the two measurements can be largely reconciled by
accounting for the contributions of two-photon exchange (TPE). TPE effects are
not typically included in the standard set of radiative corrections since
theoretical calculations of the TPE effects are highly model dependent, and,
until recently, no direct evidence of significant TPE effects has been
observed.
  [Purpose] We measured the ratio of positron-proton to electron-proton
elastic-scattering cross sections in order to determine the TPE contribution to
elastic electron-proton scattering and thereby resolve the proton electric form
factor discrepancy.
  [Methods] We produced a mixed simultaneous electron-positron beam in
Jefferson Lab's Hall B by passing the 5.6 GeV primary electron beam through a
radiator to produce a bremsstrahlung photon beam and then passing the photon
beam through a convertor to produce electron/positron pairs. The mixed
electron-positron (lepton) beam with useful energies from approximately 0.85 to
3.5 GeV then struck a 30-cm long liquid hydrogen (LH$_2$) target located within
the CEBAF Large Acceptance Spectrometer (CLAS). By detecting both the scattered
leptons and the recoiling protons we identified and reconstructed elastic
scattering events and determined the incident lepton energy. A detailed
description of the experiment is presented.

sustainable operation of cyber-physical systems. Nevertheless, the complete
potential of the technology has not yet been fully exploited in practice due to
communication limitations posed by the real-world infrastructures. This work
investigates fundamental properties of distributed optimization based on
gradient methods, where gradient information is communicated using limited
number of bits. In particular, a general class of quantized gradient methods
are studied where the gradient direction is approximated by a finite
quantization set. Sufficient and necessary conditions are provided on such a
quantization set to guarantee that the methods minimize any convex objective
function with Lipschitz continuous gradient and a nonempty and bounded set of
optimizers. A lower bound on the cardinality of the quantization set is
provided, along with specific examples of minimal quantizations. Convergence
rate results are established that connect the fineness of the quantization and
the number of iterations needed to reach a predefined solution accuracy.
Generalizations of the results to a relevant class of constrained problems
using projections are considered. Finally, the results are illustrated by
simulations of practical systems.

deliver important input for planning nuclear physics experiments and future
radioactive ion beam facilities. These models are usually benchmarked against
data from stable beam experiments. In the future, two-step fragmentation
reactions with exotic nuclei as stepping stones are a promising tool to reach
the most neutron-rich nuclei, creating a need for models to describe also these
reactions.
  Purpose: We want to extend the presently available data on fragmentation
reactions towards the light exotic region on the nuclear chart. Furthermore, we
want to improve the understanding of projectile fragmentation especially for
unstable isotopes.
  Method: We have measured projectile fragments from 10,12-18C and 10-15B
isotopes colliding with a carbon target. These measurements were all performed
within one experiment, which gives rise to a very consistent dataset. We
compare our data to model calculations.
  Results: One-proton removal cross sections with different final neutron
numbers (1pxn) for relativistic 10,12-18C and 10-15B isotopes impinging on a
carbon target. Comparing model calculations to the data, we find that EPAX is
not able to describe the data satisfactorily. Using ABRABLA07 on the other
hand, we find that the average excitation energy per abraded nucleon needs to
be decreased from 27 MeV to 8.1 MeV. With that decrease ABRABLA07 describes the
data surprisingly well.
  Conclusions: Extending the available data towards light unstable nuclei with
a consistent set of new data have allowed for a systematic investigation of the
role of the excitation energy induced in projectile fragmentation. Most
striking is the apparent mass dependence of the average excitation energy per
abraded nucleon. Nevertheless, this parameter, which has been related to
final-state interactions, requires further study.

star is already bright. Its actual luminosity depends sensitively on the
stellar structure. We compute pre-main-sequence tracks for massive and
intermediate-mass stars with variable accretion rates and study the evolution
of stellar radius, effective temperature and ionizing luminosity, starting at
$2\,M_\odot$ with convective or radiative structures. The radiative case shows
a much stronger swelling of the protostar for high accretion rates than the
convective case. For radiative structures, the star is very sensitive to the
accretion rate and reacts quickly to accretion bursts, leading to considerable
changes in photospheric properties on timescales as short as 100 - 1000 yr. The
evolution for convective structures is much less influenced by the
instantaneous accretion rate, and produces a monotonically increasing ionizing
flux that can be many orders of magnitude smaller than in the radiative case.
For massive stars, it results in a delay of the HII region expansion by up to
10,000 yr. In the radiative case, the HII region can potentially be engulfed by
the star during the swelling, which never happens in the convective case. We
conclude that the early stellar structure has a large impact on the radiative
feedback during the pre-main-sequence evolution of massive protostars and
introduces an important uncertainty that should be taken into account. Because
of their lower effective temperatures, our convective models may hint at a
solution to an observed discrepancy between the luminosity distribution
functions of massive young stellar objects and compact HII regions.

this paper, we make an in-depth investigation of its electronic structure. We
find that the band structure of nitrogene can be engineered in several ways:
controlling the stacking of monolayers, application of biaxial tensile strain,
and application of perpendicular electric field. The band gap of nitrogene is
found to decrease with the increasing number of layers. The perpendicular
electric field can also reduce the band gap when it is larger than 0.18V/
{\AA}, and the gap closes at 0.35V/ {\AA}. A nearly linear dependence of the
gap on the electric field is found during the process. Application of biaxial
strain can decrease the band gap as well, and eventually closes the gap. After
the gap-closing, we find six inequivalent Dirac points in the Brillouin zone
under the strain between 17% and 28%, and the nitrogene monolayer becomes a
Dirac semimetal. These findings suggest that the electronic structure of
nitrogene can be modified by several techniques, which makes it a promising
candidate for electronic devices.

exploratory study of this mechanism in the intra-cluster-medium (ICM). In view
of large-scale turbulence in the ICM we adopt a reconnection scheme that is
based on turbulent reconnection and MHD turbulence. In this case particles are
accelerated and decelerated in a systematic way in reconnecting and
magnetic-dynamo regions, respectively, and on longer time-scales undergo a
stochastic process diffusing across these sites (similar to second-order
Fermi). Our study extends on larger scales numerical studies that focused on
the acceleration in and around turbulent reconnecting regions. We suggest that
this mechanism may play a role in the reacceleration of relativistic electrons
in galaxy clusters providing a new physical scenario to explain the origin of
cluster-scale diffuse radio emission. Indeed differently from current turbulent
reacceleration models proposed for example for radio halos this mechanism is
based on the effect of large-scale incompressible and super-Alfvenic
turbulence. In this new model turbulence governs the interaction between
relativistic particles and magnetic field lines that diffuse, reconnect and are
stretched in the turbulent ICM.

similar methods. We explore Earth's transit zone (ETZ), the projection of a
band around Earth's ecliptic onto the celestial plane, where observers can
detect Earth transits across the Sun. The ETZ is between $0.520^\circ$ and
$0.537^\circ$ wide due to the non-circular Earth orbit. The restricted ETZ
(rETZ), where Earth transits the Sun less than 0.5 solar radii from its center,
is ~$0.262^\circ$ wide. We first compile a target list of 45 K and 37 G dwarf
stars inside the rETZ and within 1 kiloparsec (3260 lightyears) using the
Hipparcos catalog. We then greatly enlarge the number of potential targets by
constructing an analytic galactic disk model and find that ~$10^5$ K and G
dwarf stars should reside within the rETZ. The ongoing GAIA space mission can
potentially discover all G dwarfs among them (several $10^4$) within the next
five years. Many more potentially habitable planets orbit dim, unknown M stars
in the ETZ and other stars that traversed the ETZ long time ago. If any of
these planets host intelligent observers, they could have identified Earth as a
habitable, or even as a living, world, and we could be receiving their

scales. Because coefficients are typically multiplicative in real space, they
turn into convolution operators in spectral space, mixing all wavenumbers.
However, in many applications, only the largest scales of the solution are of
interest and so the question turns to whether it is possible to build effective
coarse-scale models of the coefficients in such a manner that the large scales
of the solution are left intact. Here we apply the method of numerical
homogenization to deterministic linear equations to generate sub-grid-scale

tested in 1D and 2D scenarios and found to reproduce the coarse scales of the
solution to varying degrees of accuracy depending on the cutoff. We relate this
method to mode-elimination Renormalization Group (RG) and discuss the
connection between accuracy and the cutoff wavenumber. The tradeoff is governed
by a form of the uncertainty principle for convolutions, which states that as
the convolution operator is squeezed in the spectral domain, it broadens in
real space. As a consequence, basis sparsity is a high virtue and the choice of
the basis can be critical.

explicit, that these objects are related. General results concerning
$(N,k)$-icons and seam-, D- and pita-forms are given. Instructions to crochet
D-forms are given in the Appendix.

mathematics teaching in the Italian system of education giving an account of
the main features of Italian mathematics education, and referring to the
official syllabi, to the used textbooks, to the debates. We will see that
interesting proposals in a period of about 150 years will always have to face a
tendency to rigor as well as a resistance towards innovation.

which interact with their electors, with the undecided voters, and with the
electors of the other parties. This extends what was done in a previous paper,
where this last type of interactions was not considered. Of course, taking them
into account makes the system closer to real life. To produce an exactly
solvable model, we restrict here to quadratic Hamiltonians, so that the
equations of motion turn out to be linear. The dynamics of the so-called {\em
decision functions} are deduced, and some explicit situations are considered in
details.
