The supplementary material is 28 pages",,,,"stat.CO stat.ME stat.ML","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Speeding up Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) for datasets with many
observations by data subsampling has recently received considerable attention.
A pseudo-marginal MCMC method is proposed that estimates the likelihood by data
subsampling using a block-Poisson estimator. The estimator is a product of
Poisson estimators, allowing us to update a single block of subsample
indicators in each MCMC iteration so that a desired correlation is achieved
between the logs of successive likelihood estimates. This is important since
pseudo-marginal MCMC with positively correlated likelihood estimates can use
substantially smaller subsamples without adversely affecting the sampling
efficiency. The block-Poisson estimator is unbiased but not necessarily
positive, so the algorithm runs the MCMC on the absolute value of the
likelihood estimator and uses an importance sampling correction to obtain
consistent estimates of the posterior mean of any function of the parameters.
Our article derives guidelines to select the optimal tuning parameters for our
method and shows that it compares very favourably to regular MCMC without
subsampling, and to two other recently proposed exact subsampling approaches in
the literature.

scheme that achieves the capacity of the additive white Gaussian (AWGN)

concatenating a capacity-achieving nested lattice code with a suitable
high-rate linear code over an appropriate finite field, we can achieve the
capacity of the AWGN channel with polynomial encoding and decoding complexity.
Specifically, we show that using inner Construction-A lattice codes and outer
Reed-Solomon codes, we can obtain capacity-achieving codes whose encoding and
decoding complexities grow as $O(N^2)$, while the probability of error decays
exponentially in $N$, where $N$ denotes the blocklength. Replacing the outer
Reed-Solomon code by an expander code helps us further reduce the decoding
complexity to $O(N\log^2N)$. This also gives us a recipe for converting a
high-complexity nested lattice code for a Gaussian channel to a low-complexity
concatenated code without any loss in the asymptotic rate. As examples, we
describe polynomial-time coding schemes for the wiretap channel, and the
compute-and-forward scheme for computing integer linear combinations of

of the CI sphere. Furthermore, we introduce a simple extension of CI when l is
infinite, the CI propagation (CI_P) algorithm, that considers the global
optimization of influence via message passing in the whole network and
identifies a slightly smaller fraction of influencers than CI. Remarkably, CI_P
is able to reproduce the exact analytical optimal percolation threshold
obtained by Bau, Wormald, Random Struct. Alg. 21, 397 (2002) for cubic random
regular graphs, leaving little improvement left for random graphs. We also
introduce the Collective Immunization Belief Propagation algorithm (CI_BP), a
belief-propagation (BP) variant of CI based on optimal immunization, which has
the same performance as CI_P. However, this small augmented performance of the
order of 1-2 % in the low influencers tail comes at the expense of increasing
the computational complexity from O(N log N) to O(N^2 log N), rendering both,
CI_P and CI_BP, prohibitive for finding influencers in modern-day big-data. The
same nonlinear running time drawback pertains to a recently introduced
BP-decimation (BPD) algorithm by Mugisha, Zhou, arXiv:1603.05781. For instance,
we show that for big-data social networks of typically 200 million users (eg,
active Twitter users sending 500 million tweets per day), CI finds the
influencers in less than 3 hours running on a single CPU, while the BP
algorithms (CI_P, CI_BP and BDP) would take more than 3,000 years to accomplish
the same task.

kinetic terms. We reevaluate the production of \varphi by photon fusion to
accommodate recent developments on additional contributions to relativistic
light-light scattering. We also study the production of \varphi via gluon

diphoton excess in LHC8 data within \sim 1\sigma. We also show that if the
resonance production is dominated by gluon fusion the null results on dijet

hotter region without necessitating either particle transport or external work
on the conductor, thereby bypassing the compressor part of a classical heat
pump cycle. Our mechanism relies on thermostatting the kinetic and
configurational temperatures of the same particle differently. We keep the two
ends of a conductor, which in the present study is a single dimensional
$\phi^4$ chain, at the same kinetic temperature $T_0$, but at different
configurational temperatures - one end hotter and the other end colder than
$T_0$. While external energy is needed within the thermostatted regions to
achieve this differential thermostatting, no external work is performed on the
system itself. We show that the mechanism satisfies the statistical form of the
second law of thermodynamics (the fluctuation theorem). The proposed mechanism
reveals two interesting findings - (i) contrary to traditional thermodynamics
where only the kinetic temperature is thought to govern heat conduction,
configurational temperature can also play an important role, and (ii) the
relative temperature difference between the kinetic and configurational
variables governs the direction of heat flow. The challenge, however, is in
developing experimental techniques to thermostat the kinetic and
configurational variables of the same particle at different values.

Short Term Memory Recurrent Neural Network (LSTM-RNN) is employed as the main
classification architecture. Firstly, soft attention mechanism aligns the audio

corresponding to each classification emotion type, are added to locate the

the soft attention mechanism. The experiment results on EmotiW2015 dataset and
the qualitative analysis show the efficiency of the proposed two techniques.

The significant influence of these variable parameters is observed on the

One solution is to impose a lasso penalty to shrink parameter estimates toward
zero and perform continuous model selection. The lasso-penalized mixture of
linear regressions model (L-MLR) is a class of regularization methods for the
model selection problem in the fixed number of variables setting. In this
article, we propose a new algorithm for the maximum penalized-likelihood
estimation of the L-MLR model. This algorithm is constructed via the
minorization--maximization algorithm paradigm. Such a construction allows for
coordinate-wise updates of the parameter components, and produces globally
convergent sequences of estimates that generate monotonic sequences of
penalized log-likelihood values. These three features are missing in the
previously presented approximate expectation-maximization algorithms. The
previous difficulty in producing a globally convergent algorithm for the
maximum penalized-likelihood estimation of the L-MLR model is due to the
intractability of finding exact updates for the mixture model mixing
proportions in the maximization-step. In our algorithm, we solve this issue by
showing that it can be converted into a polynomial root finding problem. Our
solution to this problem involves a polynomial basis conversion that is
interesting in its own right. The method is tested in simulation and with an
application to Major League Baseball salary data from the 1990s and the present

extend traditional expansion moves by two ways: localization and spatial

to the locations of local alpha-expansions. By spatial propagation, we design
our local alpha-expansions to propagate currently assigned labels for nearby
regions. With this localization and spatial propagation, our method can
efficiently infer MRF models with a continuous label space using randomized
search. Our method has several advantages over previous approaches that are
based on fusion moves or belief propagation; it produces submodular moves
deriving a subproblem optimality; it helps find good, smooth, piecewise linear

symmetries. Both of these ideas are of course multi-faceted, and we confine
ourselves to making two points. Both points are about dualities in string
theory, and both have the 'flavour' that two dual theories are 'closer in
content' than you might think. For both points, we adopt a simple conception of
a duality as an 'isomorphism' between theories: more precisely, as appropriate
bijections between the two theories' sets of states and sets of quantities.
  The first point (Section 3) is that this conception of duality meshes with
two dual theories being 'gauge related' in the general philosophical sense of
being physically equivalent. For a string duality, such as T-duality and
gauge/gravity duality, this means taking such features as the radius of a
compact dimension, and the dimensionality of spacetime, to be 'gauge'.
  The second point (Sections 4, 5 and 6) is much more specific. We give a
result about gauge/gravity duality that shows its relation to gauge symmetries
(in the physical sense of symmetry transformations that are
spacetime-dependent) to be subtler than you might expect. For gauge theories,
you might expect that the duality bijections relate only gauge-invariant
quantities and states, in the sense that gauge symmetries in one theory will be
unrelated to any symmetries in the other theory. This may be so in general; and
indeed, it is suggested by discussions of Polchinski and Horowitz. But we show
that in gauge/gravity duality, each of a certain class of gauge symmetries in
the gravity/bulk theory, viz. diffeomorphisms, is related by the duality to a
position-dependent symmetry of the gauge/boundary theory.

oscillations in large hot (with the temperature higher than 3 MK) coronal loops
have been observed as the quasi-periodic modulation of the EUV and microwave
intensity emission and the Doppler shift of coronal emission lines, and have
been interpreted as standing slow magnetoacoustic (longitudinal) oscillations.
Quasi-periodic pulsations of shorter periods, detected in thermal and
non-thermal emissions in solar flares could be produced by a similar mechanism.
We present theoretical modelling of the standing slow magnetoacoustic mode,
showing that this mode of oscillation is highly sensitive to peculiarities of
the radiative cooling and heating function. We generalised the theoretical
model of standing slow magnetoacoustic oscillations in a hot plasma, including
the effects of the radiative losses, and accounting for plasma heating. The
heating mechanism is not specified and taken empirically to compensate the
cooling by radiation and thermal-conduction. It is shown that the evolution of
the oscillations is described by a generalised Burgers equation. Numerical
solution of an initial value problem for the evolutionary equation demonstrates
that different dependences of the radiative cooling and plasma heating on the
temperature lead to different regimes of the oscillations, including growing,
quasi-stationary and rapidly decaying. Our findings provide a theoretical
foundation for probing the coronal heating function, and may explain the
observations of decayless long-period quasi-periodic pulsations in flares. The
hydrodynamic approach employed in this study should be considered with caution
in the modelling of non-thermal emission associated with flares, as it misses
potentially important non-hydrodynamic effects.

different sensors does not have the same implication, is quite common in
practical scenarios and may bring serious problems. Our contributions are
two-fold. Firstly, we provide a principled mathematical definition of ""label

referred to as LS-M criterion. Then, to handle the LS-DM, we propose a novel
two-step distributed fusion algorithm, named as GCI fusion via label spaces
matching (GCI-LSM). The first step is to match the label spaces from different
sensors. To this end, we build a ranked assignment problem and design a cost
function consistent with LS-M criterion to seek the optimal solution of
matching correspondence between label spaces of different sensors. The second
step is to perform the GCI fusion on the matched label space. We also derive
the GCI fusion with generic labeled multi-object (LMO) densities based on LS-M,
which is the foundation of labeled distributed fusion algorithms. Simulation
results for Gaussian mixture implementation highlight the performance of the

solve this challenging problem, we firstly approximate the fused posterior as
the unlabeled version of $\delta$-generalized labeled multi-Bernoulli
($\delta$-GLMB) distribution, referred to as generalized multi-Bernoulli (GMB)

posterior distribution, e.g., fusion with a third sensor node in the sensor

fused GMB posterior distribution as an MB distribution which matches its
first-order statistical moment. The proposed fusion algorithm is implemented
using sequential Monte Carlo technique and its performance is highlighted by
numerical results.

happened. It was created by the manipulation of data. Economic growth in
various regions is at different levels of development but it follows similar,
non-divergent trajectories. Unified Growth Theory is shown yet again to be
incorrect and scientifically unacceptable. It promotes incorrect and even
potentially dangerous concepts. The distorted presentation of data supporting
the concept of the great divergence shows that economic growth is now
developing along moderately-increasing trajectories but mathematical analysis
of the same data and even their undistorted presentation shows that these
trajectories are now increasing approximately vertically with time. So, while
the distorted presentation of data used in the Unified Growth Theory suggests
generally sustainable and secure economic growth, the undistorted presentation
of data demonstrates that the growth is unsustainable and insecure. The concept
of takeoffs from stagnation to the sustained-growth regime promoted in the
Unified Growth Theory is also dangerously misleading because it suggests a
sustainable and prosperous future while the mathematical analysis of data shows
that the current economic growth is insecure and unsustainable.

$K$ denotes prefix-free Kolmogorov complexity (while $C$ denotes plain
Kolmogorov complexity). Such an $f$ is now called a Solovay function. We prove
that many classical results about $K$ can be obtained by replacing $K$ by a
Solovay function. For example, the three following properties of a function $g$
all hold for the function $K$.
  (i) The sum of the terms $\sum_n 2^{-g(n)}$ is a Martin-L\""of random real.

is modelled as an equimolar binary mixture of oppositely charged equisized hard

matrix-fluid system as a partly-quenched model, we develop a theoretical
approach which combines the method of collective variables with the extension
of the scaled-particle theory (SPT) for a hard-sphere fluid confined in a

perturbation theory using the SPT for the description of the thermodynamics of

calculated in the random-phase approximation and also when the effects of
higher-order correlations between ions are taken into account. Both
approximations correctly reproduce the basic effects of porous media on the
vapour-liquid phase diagram, i.e., with a decrease of porosity the critical
point shifts toward lower fluid densities and lower temperatures and the
coexistence region is getting narrower. For the fixed matrix porosity, both the
critical temperature and the critical density increase with an increase of size
of matrix particles and tend to the critical values of the bulk RPM.

makes use of the phase differences in Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) spectra

stable over time, while being approximately uniform-random for a sum over many
sources or for noise. Using only milliseconds-long datasets, the method finds
the strongest interfering transmitters, a first-order solution for relative
timing calibrations, and faulty data channels. No knowledge of gain response or
quiescent noise levels of the receivers is required. With relatively small data
volumes, this approach is suitable for use in an online system monitoring setup
for interferometric arrays.
  We have applied the method to our cosmic-ray data collection, a collection of
measurements of short pulses from extensive air showers, recorded by the LOFAR
radio telescope. Per air shower, we have collected 2 ms of raw time series data
for each receiver. The spectral cleaning has a calculated optimal sensitivity
corresponding to a power signal-to-noise ratio of 0.08 (or -11 dB) in a
spectral window of 25 kHz, for 2 ms of data in 48 antennas. This is well
sufficient for our application. Timing calibration across individual antenna
pairs has been performed at 0.4 ns precision; for calibration of signal clocks
across stations of 48 antennas the precision is 0.1 ns. Monitoring differences
in timing calibration per antenna pair over the course of the period 2011 to
2015 shows a precision of 0.08 ns, which is useful for monitoring and
correcting drifts in signal path synchronizations.
  A cross-check method for timing calibration is presented, using a pulse

periodic beam sweeping required to improve link quality in case of transient
link blockage. This is particularly critical in commercial off-the-shelf
devices, which require simple yet efficient solutions. First, we analyze the
operation of such a commercial device to understand the impact of link blockage
in practice. To this end, we measure TCP throughput for different traffic loads
while blocking the link at regular intervals. Second, we derive a Markov model
based on our practical insights to compute throughput for the case of transient
blockage. We use this model to evaluate the trade-off between throughput and
periodic beam sweeping. Finally, we validate our results using throughput
traces collected using the aforementioned commercial device. Both our model and
our practical measurements show that transient blockage causes significant
signal fluctuation due to suboptimal beam realignment. In particular,
fluctuations increase with traffic load, limiting the achievable throughput. We
show that choosing lower traffic loads allows us to reduce fluctuations by 41%
while achieving the same net throughput than with higher traffic loads.

makes NGC4235 only the second known Seyfert galaxy after Mrk6 to show
signatures of episodic activity. Spitzer and Herschel infrared spectral energy
distribution (SED) modelling using the clumpyDREAM code predicts star formation
rates (SFR) that are an order of magnitude lower than those required to power
the radio lobes in these Seyferts (~0.13-0.23 M_sun/yr compared to the required
SFR of ~2.0-2.7 M_sun/yr in NGC4594 and NGC4235, respectively). This finding
along with the detection of parsec and sub-kpc radio jets in both Seyfert
galaxies, that are roughly along the same position angles as the radio lobes,
strongly support the suggestion that Seyfert lobes are AGN-powered. SED
modelling supports the ""true"" type 2 classification of NGC4594: this galaxy
lacks significant dust obscuration as well as a prominent broad-line region.
Between the two Seyfert galaxies, there is an inverse relation between their
radio-loudness and Eddington ratio and a direct relation between their
Eddington-scaled jet power and bolometric power.

the spectrum of a spatio-temporal Koopman operator, which has a travelling wave

modes to span a subspace subject to those symmetries. The resolvent is
interpreted as the mapping between the Koopman modes of the Reynolds stress
divergence and the velocity field. It is shown that the singular vectors of the
resolvent (the resolvent modes) are the optimal basis in which to express the
velocity field Koopman modes where the latter are not a priori known.

dependence on the self-propelling momentum of pedestrian particles. The model
parameters are varied over a large design space and the results are compared
with experimental observations to validate the model. This model is then used
to assess the different approaches to minimize passenger contacts during

effective in reducing the contacts between passengers. Column wise deplaning

submillimeter source SMM1. The near-IR polarization imaging data of N4W reveal
two infrared reflection nebulae close to each other, which are in favor of the
outflows of IRS\,1 and IRS\,2. The bipolar mid-IR emission centered on IRS\,4
and the arc-like molecular gas shell are lying on the same axis, indicating a
bipolar molecular outflow from IRS\,4. There are two dust temperature
distributions in N4W. The warmer one is widely distributed and has a
temperature $T_\mathrm{d}\gtrsim28\,\mathrm{K}$, with the colder one from the
embedded compact submillimeter source SMM1. N4W's mass is estimated to be
$\sim2.5\times10^3\,M_\odot$, and the mass of SMM1 is
$\sim5.5\times10^2\,M_\odot$ at $T_\mathrm{d}=15\,\mathrm{K}$, calculated from
the CO\,$1-0$ emission and $870\,\mu$m dust continuum emission, respectively.
Based on the estimates of bolometric luminosity of IRS\,1\,--\,4, these four
sources are intermediate-mass YSOs at least. SMM1 is gravitationally bound, and
is capable of forming intermediate-mass stars or even possibly massive stars.
The co-existence of the IR bright YSOs and the submillimeter source represents
potential sequential star formation processes separated by $\sim0.5$\,Myr in
N4W. This small age spread implies that the intermediate-mass star formation
processes happening in N4W are almost coeval.

  Results: Here we use probabilistic machine learning to extract higher order
features associated with the methylation profile across a defined region. These
features quantitate precisely notions of shape of a methylation profile,
capturing spatial correlations in DNA methylation across genomic regions. Using
these higher order features across promoter-proximal regions, we are able to
construct a powerful machine learning predictor of gene expression,
significantly improving upon the predictive power of average DNA methylation
levels. Furthermore, we can use higher order features to cluster
promoter-proximal regions, showing that five major patterns of methylation
occur at promoters across different cell lines, and we provide evidence that
methylation beyond CpG islands may be related to regulation of gene expression.
Our results support previous reports of a functional role of spatial
correlations in methylation patterns, and provide a mean to quantitate such
features for downstream analyses.

having GEV distribution and the Inverse Gaussian distribution is used for
lifetime distribution. Monte-Carlo simulation studies are conducted to
demonstrate the performances of both approaches. Simulation results suggest the
superiority of the modified profile likelihood estimates over the profile

that by making Weyl's proposed geometric connection be pure imaginary, not only
are we able to metricate electromagnetism, an underlying local conformal
invariance makes the geometry be strictly Riemannian and prevents observational
gravity from being complex. Via torsion we achieve an analogous metrication for
axial-vector fields. We generalize our procedure to Yang-Mills theories, and
achieve a metrication of all the fundamental forces. Only in the gravity sector
does our approach differ from the standard picture of fundamental forces, with
our approach requiring that standard Einstein gravity be replaced by conformal
gravity. We show that quantum conformal gravity is a consistent and unitary
quantum gravitational theory, one that, unlike string theory, only requires
four spacetime dimensions.

inequalities, which applies uniformly to each LE-signature and is given purely
in terms of the order-theoretic properties of the algebraic interpretations of
the logical connectives. Together with this, we introduce a variant of the
algorithm ALBA, specific to the setting of LEs, which effectively computes
first-order correspondents of LE-inequalities, and is guaranteed to succeed on
a wide class of inequalities (the so-called inductive inequalities) which
significantly extend the Sahlqvist class. Further, we show that every
inequality on which ALBA succeeds is canonical. The projection of these results
yields state-of-the-art correspondence theory for many well known substructural
logics, such as the Lambek calculus and its extensions, the Lambek-Grishin

paper proposes an experiment to demonstrate the block universe using
interplanetary distances and high relative speeds such as those accessible
through the NASA Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter. The proposed experiment hinges on
signals exchanged between Earth and the Orbiter which reveal a time interval of
some tens of milliseconds in the future of the Earth which is already in the
past of the Orbiter. Since this experiment can be performed at any time, and
since the magnitude of the time interval can in principle be increased in
proportion to the distances and speeds over which it is performed, an observer
can always be found for whom the past is in the future of another observer. The
only explanation that fits these observations is a block universe in which all
events in the past, present and future of any observer are equally enfolded
into spacetime.

detailed and non-detailed but also without the projectability conditions.
Accordingly, we derive the modifications in the Friedmann equations due to
single scalar field potentials describing power-law and
minimal-supersymmetrically extended inflation. By implementing four types of
the equations-of-state charactering the cosmic background geometry, the
dependence of the tensorial and spectral density fluctuations and their ratio
on the inflation field is determined. The latter characterizes the time
evolution of the inflation field relative to the Hubble parameter. Furthermore,
the ratio of tensorial-to-spectral density fluctuations is calculated in
dependence on the spectral index. The resulting slow-roll parameters apparently
differ from the ones deduced from the standard General Relativity (Friedmann
gravity). We also observe that the tensorial-to-spectral density fluctuations
continuously decrease when moving from non-detailed HL gravity, to Friedmann
gravity, to HL gravity without the projectibility, and to detailed HL gravity.
This regular patter is valid for three types of cosmic equations-of-state and
different inflation potential models. The results fit well with the recent
PLANCK observations.
