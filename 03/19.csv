of the row sums indexed by irreducible characters, when restricted to various
subsets of the conjugacy classes. A notable example is that of partitions with
all parts odd. More generally, we study representations related to the
conjugacy action of the symmetric group. These arise as sums of submodules
induced from centraliser subgroups, and their Frobenius characteristics have
elegant descriptions, often as a multiplicity-free sum of power-sum symmetric
functions. We describe a general framework in which such representations, and
consequently such linear combinations of power-sums, can be analysed. The
conjugacy action for the symmetric group, and more generally for a large class
of groups, is known to contain every irreducible. We find other representations
of dimension $n!$ with this property, including a twisted analogue of the
conjugacy action.

Observations from the Solar Optical Telescope (SOT) aboard the Hinode satellite
starting on 27th April 2007 until 1st May 2007 were analysed. 20 scans of the
6302A Fe I line pair recorded by SOT/SP were inverted using the SPINOR code.
The inversions were analysed together with SOT/BFI G-band and Ca II H and
SOT/NFI Ha observations. Following the disappearance of an initial Ha filament
aligned along the polarity inversion line (PIL) of the AR, a new Ha filament
formed in its place some 20 hours later, which remained stable for at least 1.5
days. The creation of the new Ha filament was driven by the ascent of
horizontal magnetic fields from the photosphere into the chromosphere at three
separate locations along the PIL. The magnetic fields at two of these locations
were situated directly underneath the initial Ha filament and formed orphan
penumbrae already aligned along the Ha filament channel. The 700 G orphan
penumbrae were stable and trapped in the photosphere until the disappearance of
the overlying initial Ha filament, after which they started to ascend into the
chromosphere at 10pm5 m/s. Each ascent was associated with a simultaneous
magnetic flux reduction of up to 50% in the photosphere. The ascended orphan
penumbrae formed dark 'seed' structures in Ha in parallel with the PIL, which
elongated and merged to form an Ha filament. The filament channel featured
horizontal magnetic fields of on average 260 G at log(tau)=-2 suspended above
the nearly field-free lower photosphere. The fields took on an 'inverse'
configuration at log(tau)=-2 suggesting a flux rope for the new Ha filament.
The orphan penumbral fields ascend into the chromosphere 9-24 hours before the
Ha filament is fully formed. The destruction of the initial Ha filament was
likely caused by the flux emergence at the third location along the PIL.

where the value function is related to the conditional cumulant generating

$\alpha$-uniformly H\""older continuous on the closure of the domain are also
sufficient conditions for positive definiteness of the second variation of the

the second variation using Kazamaki's sufficient condition for
$L^q$-boundedness of exponential martingales, and using Fredholm theory to
prove the finiteness of the moment generating function of the first exit time

combining convex optimisation and Monte Carlo methods. We apply the result to

patterns. Mobile phone records provide an excellent proxy of human mobility,
showing that movements exhibit a high level of memory. However, the precise
role of memory in widely adopted proxies of mobility, as mobile phone records,
is unknown. Here we use 560 millions of call detail records from Senegal to
show that standard Markovian approaches, including higher-order ones, fail in
capturing real mobility patterns and introduce spurious movements never
observed in reality. We introduce an adaptive memory-driven approach to
overcome such issues. At variance with Markovian models, it is able to
realistically model conditional waiting times, i.e. the probability to stay in
a specific area depending on individual's historical movements. Our results
demonstrate that in standard mobility models the individuals tend to diffuse
faster than what observed in reality, whereas the predictions of the adaptive
memory approach significantly agree with observations. We show that, as a
consequence, the incidence and the geographic spread of a disease could be
inadequately estimated when standard approaches are used, with crucial
implications on resources deployment and policy making during an epidemic
outbreak.

Nature, 2015, doi:10.1038/nature14162], the cause of which remains to be
explained. The estimated brightness of the plume exceeds that expected for
auroral emissions, and its projected altitude greatly exceeds that at which
clouds are expected to form. We report on in-situ measurements of ionospheric
plasma density and solar wind parameters throughout this interval made by Mars
Express, obtained over the same surface region, but at the opposing terminator.
Measurements in the ionosphere at the corresponding location frequently show a
disturbed structure, though this is not atypical for such regions with intense
crustal magnetic fields. We tentatively conclude that the formation and/or
transport of this plume to the altitudes where it was observed could be due in
part to the result of a large interplanetary coronal mass ejection (ICME)
encountering the Martian system. Interestingly, we note that the only similar
plume detection in May 1997 may also have been associated with a large ICME
impact at Mars.

  Equations: Analysis of Lossless Four-Bus Systems","6 pages. 1 figure. IEEE style",,,,"math.OC cs.CE cs.SY math.AG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The power flow equations model the steady-state relationship between the
power injections and voltage phasors in an electric power system. By separating
the real and imaginary components of the voltage phasors, the power flow
equations can be formulated as a system of quadratic polynomials. Only the real
solutions to these polynomial equations are physically meaningful. This paper
focuses on the maximum number of real solutions to the power flow equations. An
upper bound on the number of real power flow solutions commonly used in the
literature is the maximum number of complex solutions. There exist two- and
three-bus systems for which all complex solutions are real. It is an open
question whether this is also the case for larger systems. This paper
investigates four-bus systems using techniques from numerical algebraic
geometry and conjectures a negative answer to this question. In particular,
this paper studies lossless, four-bus systems composed of PV buses connected by
lines with arbitrary susceptances. Computing the Galois group, which is
degenerate, enables conversion of the problem of counting the number of real
solutions to the power flow equations into counting the number of positive
roots of a univariate sextic polynomial. From this analysis, it is conjectured
that the system has at most 16 real solutions, which is strictly less than the
maximum number of complex solutions, namely 20. We also provide explicit
parameter values where this system has 16 real solutions so that the
conjectured upper bound is achievable.

gave a persistent unabsorbed luminosity of $3.4\times10^{36}$ erg cm$^{-2}$
s$^{-1}$ in 0.6 $-$ 55 keV. The source was in a relatively bright low/hard

""double-seed"" Comptonization model, incorporating a common corona with an
electron temperature of $\sim13$ keV. The seed photons are thought to be
supplied from both the neutron star surface, and a cooler truncated disk.
Compared to a sample of non-dipping low-mass X-ray binaries in the low/hard

larger Comptonizing $y$-parameter of $\sim1.4$ and a larger coronal optical
depth of $\sim5$. This result, when attributed to the high inclination of EXO

In this paper we propose a method to assess the statistical significance of the
overlap between pairs of heterogeneously diversified portfolios, which then
allows us to build a validated network of financial institutions where links
indicate potential contagion channels due to realized portfolio overlaps. The
method is implemented on a historical database of institutional holdings
ranging from 1999 to the end of 2013, but can be in general applied to any
bipartite network where the presence of similar sets of neighbors is of
interest. We find that the proportion of validated network links (i.e., of
statistically significant overlaps) increased steadily before the 2007-2008
global financial crisis and reached a maximum when the crisis occurred. We
argue that the nature of this measure implies that systemic risk from fire
sales liquidation was maximal at that time. After a sharp drop in 2008,
systemic risk resumed its growth in 2009, with a notable acceleration in 2013,
reaching levels not seen since 2007. We finally show that market trends tend to
be amplified in the portfolios identified by the algorithm, such that it is

fundamental biological processes. Accurate isoform quantification from RNA-seq

recent accumulation of multiple RNA-seq data sets from the same tissue or cell

multiple RNA-seq samples either pool the samples into one sample or assign
equal weights to the samples when estimating isoform abundance. These methods
ignore the possible heterogeneity in the quality of different samples and could
result in biased and unrobust estimates. In this article, we develop a method,

integrating multiple RNA-seq samples under a Bayesian framework. Our method
aims to (1) identify a consistent group of samples with homogeneous quality and

the average free energy of a disordered system with quenched randomness, using
the replicas. The basic tool of this technique is a distributional
zeta-function, a complex function whose derivative at the origin yields the
average free energy of the system as the sum of two contributions: the first
one is a series in which all the integer moments of the partition function of
the model contribute; the second one, which can not be written as a series of
the integer moments, can be made as small as desired. This result supports the
use of integer moments of the partition function, computed via replicas, for
expressing the average free energy of the system. One advantage of the proposed
formalism is that it does not require the understanding of the properties of
the permutation group when the number of replicas goes to zero. Moreover, the
symmetry is broken using the saddle-point equations of the model. As an
application for the distributional zeta-function technique, we obtain the
average free energy of the disordered $\lambda\varphi^{4}$ model defined in a
$d$-dimensional Euclidean space.

spectroscopic diagnostic modelling of tungsten, most of whose ionization stages
will be found somewhere in the ITER fusion reactor: in the edge, divertor, or
core plasma. Accurate DR data is sparse while complete DR coverage is
unsophisticated (e.g. average-atom or Burgess General Formula) as illustrated
by the large uncertainties which currently exist in the tungsten ionization
balance. To this end, we present a series of partial final state-resolved and
total DR rate coefficients for W73+ to W56+ Tungsten ions. This is part of a
wider effort within The Tungsten Project to calculate accurate dielectronic
recombination rate coefficients for the tungsten isonuclear sequence for use in
collisional-radiative modelling of finite-density tokamak plasmas. The
recombination rate coefficients have been calculated with autostructure using
kappa-averaged relativistic wavefunctions in level resolution (intermediate
coupling) and configuration resolution (configuration average). The results are
available from OPEN-ADAS according to the adf09 and adf48 standard formats.
Comparison with previous calculations of total DR rate coefficients for W63+
and W56+ yield agreement to within 20% and 10%, respectively, at peak
temperature. It is also seen that the Juttner correction to the Maxwell
distribution has a significant effect on the ionization balance of tungsten at
the highest charge states, changing both the peak abundance temperatures and
the ionization fractions of several ions.

Min-Max trees (RMMTs), are a family of practical data structures that store
information close to their information-theoretic space lower bound. These
structures are often static; meaning that once they are built, nodes cannot be
added, deleted or modified. This read-only property simplifies concurrency.
However, newer versions of these data structures allow for a fair degree of
dynamism. Parallel programming using Hardware Transactional Memory(HTM), has
been available in mainstream microprocessors since a few years ago. One
limitation of HTM is still on the size of each transaction. This is why HTM's
use, for the moment, is limited to operations that involve few memory addresses
that need to be updated atomically, or where the level of concurrency is low.
We provide the first available implementation of a concurrent, dynamic RMMT
based on HTM, and we compare empirically how well HTM performs compared to a
naive implementation using locks. We have shown that because of the formal
properties of RMMTs, HTM is a good fit for adding concurrency to otherwise slow
lock-based alternatives. We have also shown that HTM performs better than locks
when the number of write operations increase, making it a practical structure
to use in several write-intensive contexts. This is, as far as we know, the
only practical implementation of RMMTs thoroughly tested using HTM.

making the representation easily disturbed by errors in pairwise affinities

problem on the hypergraph in which vertices represent correspondence hypotheses
and hyperedges describe high-order geometric relations. Besides, a
confidence-aware sampling method is developed to select representative vertices

more applicable to real-world experiments. In particular, we prove stability
for any causal learning function with gains chosen according to a simple scalar

only depends on the tracking error derivative (D-type ILC). Our extension
provides more degrees of freedom in the ILC design and, as a result, better
performance can be achieved. We also show that stability is not affected by a
linear dynamic coupling between neighbors. This allows us to use an additional

to account for important confounding factors, such as sex and population
substructure. A multivariate score statistic, which under the complete null
hypothesis of no phenotype-genotype association asymptotically has a
multivariate normal distribution with a covariance matrix that can be estimated
from the data, is used to test a large number of genetic markers for
association with the phenotype. We stress the importance of controlling the
familywise error rate (FWER), and use the asymptotic distribution of the
multivariate score test statistic to find a local significance level for the
individual test. Using real data (from one study on schizophrenia and bipolar
disorder and one on maximal oxygen uptake) and constructed correlated
structures, we show that our method is a powerful alternative to the popular
Bonferroni and Sidak methods. For GLMs without environmental covariates, we
show that our method is an efficient alternative to permutation methods for
multiple testing. Further, we show that if environmental covariates and genetic
markers are uncorrelated, the estimated covariance matrix of the score test
statistic can be approximated by the estimated correlation matrix for just the
genetic markers. As byproducts of our method, an effective number of
independent tests can be defined, and FWER-adjusted $p$-values can be

concentration profile along the channel $n$, the current, $J$, and the
mobility, $\mu$, of particles as a function of an external force are contrasted
with Monte Carlo simulations results of non-interacting particles. For
interacting particles the behavior of $n$, $J$ and $\mu$, obtained from the
modified Fick--Jacobs equation are in agreement with numerical simulations,
where the hard-core interaction is taken into account. Even more, for
interacting particles the modified Fick--Jacobs equation gives comparatively
more accurate results of the current difference (when a force is applied in
opposite directions) than the exact result for the non-interacting ones.

valid for a wide class of prototype pulses (not necessarily
perfect-reconstruction ones) when the number of subcarriers is sufficiently
large. This result is a valuable instrument for analyzing how users interfere
to one another and to justify, formally, the common choice of placing an empty
guard band between adjacent users. Interestingly, the number of out-band
subcarriers contaminated by each user only depends on the prototype pulses and
not on the channel nor on the equalizer. To conclude, the distortion analysis
presented in this paper, together with some simulation results for a realistic

superior to classic circular-prefix OFDMA in the case of asynchronous users.

consumption in developed countries, and therefore are targets of energy

occupant comfort. This temporal flexibility offers opportunities for the
provision of frequency regulation to support grid stability. To realize energy
savings and frequency regulation, it is of prime importance to identify a
realistic model for the temperature dynamics of a building. We identify a low-
dimensional data-driven model and a high-dimensional physics- based model for
different spatial granularities and temporal seasons based on a case study of
an entire floor of Sutardja Dai Hall, an office building on the University of
California, Berkeley campus. A comparison of these contrasting models shows
that, despite the higher forecasting accuracy of the physics-based model, both
models perform almost equally well for energy efficient control. We conclude
that the data-driven model is more amenable to controller design due to its low
complexity, and could serve as a substitution for highly complex physics- based
models with an insignificant loss of prediction accuracy for many applications.
On the other hand, our physics-based approach is more suitable for modeling
buildings with finer spatial granularities.

  We introduce $\mathtt{Katyusha}$, a direct, primal-only stochastic gradient

critically reassess the problem, in particular considering the new set of
abundances of von Steiger \& Zurbuchen 2016, determined through the \textit{in
situ} collection of solar wind samples from polar coronal holes. This new set
of abundances indicates a solar metallicity $Z_{\odot} \geq 0.0196 \pm 0.0014$,
significantly higher than the currently established value. The new values hint
at an abundance of volatile elements (i.e. C, N, O, Ne) close to previous
results of Grevesse \& Sauval 1998, whereas the abundance of refractory
elements (i.e. Mg, Si, S, Fe) is considerably increased. Using the Linear Solar
Model formalism, we determine the variation of helioseismological observables
in response to the changes in elemental abundances, in order to explore the
consistency of these new measurements with constraints from helioseismology. We
find that, for observables that are particularly sensitive to the abundance of
volatile elements, in particular the radius of the convective zone boundary
(CZB) and the sound speed around the radius of CZB, improved agreement over
previous models is obtained. Conversely, the high abundance of refractories
correlates with a higher core temperature, resulting in an overproduction of
neutrinos and a huge increase in the surface Helium abundance. We conclude that
the ""solar modelling problem"" remains unsolved.

content on the Internet. They bring up many research challenges, such as
addressing content by name, securing content, and wide-spread caching of
content. Caching has caught a lot of attention in the research community, but a
lot of the work suffers from a poor understanding of the different metrics with
which caching performance can be measured. In this paper we not only present a
comprehensive overview of different caching metrics that have been proposed for
information-centric networks, but also propose the coupling factor as a new
metric to capture the relation- ship between content popularity and network
topology. As we show, many commonly used metrics have several failure modes
which are largely ignored in literature. We identify these problems and propose
remedies and new metrics to address these failures. Our work highlights the
fundamental differences between information-centric caches and ""traditional""
cache networks and we demonstrate the need for a systematic understanding of
the metrics for information- centric caching. We also discuss how experimental
work should be done when evaluating networks of caches.

convenient for loads with a finite number of states. The present work
introduces two new design techniques for these randomized controllers:
  (i) The Individual Perspective Design (IPD) is based on the solution to a
one-dimensional family of Markov Decision Processes, whose objective function
is formulated from the point of view of a single load. The family of dynamic
programming equation appears complex, but it is shown that it is obtained
through the solution of a single ordinary differential equation.
  (ii) The System Perspective Design (SPD) is motivated by a single objective
of the grid operator: Passivity of any linearization of the aggregate
input-output model. A solution is obtained that can again be computed through
the solution of a single ordinary differential equation.
  Numerical results complement these theoretical results.

equilibrium with the fcc matrix. Inspired by this unexpected discovery of an
L1$_2$ ternary phase, we performed a first-principles search through 2224

two-phase equilibrium with the host matrix within the concentration range
$0<x<1$ ($X_{3}$[$A_{x}, B_{1-x}$]) and have a relative lattice mismatch with
the host matrix of less than or equal to 5%. These new candidates, narrowed
from 2224 systems, suggest possible experimental exploration for identifying
new superalloys. Of these 102 systems, 37 are new; they have no reported phase

of polaritons, both for their internal dynamics between their light and matter

material fraction and are easily detuned. At such, they bring several
variations to their atomic counterpart. We show that the combination of these
parameters results in important twists to the phenomenology of the Josephson
effect, such as the behaviour of the relative phase (running or oscillating) or
the occurrence of self-trapping. We undertake a comprehensive stability
analysis of the fixed points on a normalized Bloch sphere, that allows us to
provide a generalized criterion to identify the Rabi and Josephson regimes in

effects arising from binding/unbinding kinetics into our model and obtain a
scaling law characterizing the corresponding change in the diffusion

input to compute concentration recovery curves mimicking FRAP experiments in
comb-like geometries such as spiny dendrites. We show that such curves cannot
be fitted perfectly by a model based on scaled Brownian motion, i.e., a
standard diffusion equation with a time-dependent diffusion coefficient.
However, differences between the exact curves and such fits are small, thereby
providing justification for the practical use of models relying on scaled

elementary particle physics, can provide an elegant explanation of the 750 GeV
diphoton excess recently reported by ATLAS and CMS. A gauge-singlet bulk scalar
with ${\cal O}(1)$ couplings to fermions is identified as the new resonance
$S$, and the vector-like Kaluza-Klein excitations of the SM quarks and leptons
mediate its loop-induced couplings to photons and gluons. The electroweak gauge
symmetry almost unambiguously dictates the bulk matter content and hence the
hierarchies of the $S\to \gamma\gamma$, $WW$, $ZZ$, $Z\gamma$, $t\bar t$ and
dijet decay rates. We find that the $S\to Z\gamma$ decay mode is strongly
suppressed, such that $\mbox{Br}(S\to
Z\gamma)/\mbox{Br}(S\to\gamma\gamma)<0.1$. The hierarchy problem for the new
scalar boson is solved in analogy with the Higgs boson by localizing it near
the infrared brane. The infinite sums over the Kaluza-Klein towers of fermion
states are finite and can be calculated in closed form with a remarkably simple
result. Reproducing the observed $pp\to S\to\gamma\gamma$ signal requires
Kaluza-Klein masses in the multi-TeV range, consistent with bounds from flavor
physics and electroweak precision observables.
  Useful side products of our analysis, which can be adapted to almost any
model for the diphoton resonance, are the calculation of the gluon-fusion
production cross section $\sigma(pp\to S)$ at NNLO in QCD, an exact expression
for the inclusive $S\to gg$ decay rate at N$^3$LO, a study of the $S\to t\bar t

assembled before the giant impact phase of chaotic growth, potentially yield
important implications for the final composition and evolution of terrestrial
planets. These parameters critically depend on the internal balance of heating
versus cooling, which is mostly determined by the presence of short-lived
radionuclides (SLRs), such as aluminum-26 and iron-60, as well as the heat
conductivity of the material. The heating by SLRs depends on their initial
abundances, the formation time of the planetesimal and its size. It has been
argued that the cooling history is determined by the porosity of the granular
material, which undergoes dramatic changes via compaction processes and tends
to decrease with time. In this study we assess the influence of these
parameters on the thermo-mechanical evolution of young planetesimals with both
2D and 3D simulations. Using the code family I2ELVIS/I3ELVIS we have run
numerous 2D and 3D numerical finite-difference fluid dynamic models with
varying planetesimal radius, formation time and initial porosity. Our results
indicate that powdery materials lowered the threshold for melting and
convection in planetesimals, depending on the amount of SLRs present. A subset
of planetesimals retained a powdery surface layer which lowered the thermal
conductivity and hindered cooling. The effect of initial porosity was small,
however, compared to those of planetesimal size and formation time, which
dominated the thermo-mechanical evolution and were the primary factors for the
onset of melting and differentiation. We comment on the implications of this
work concerning the structure and evolution of these planetesimals, as well as
their behavior as possible building blocks of terrestrial planets.

includes a non-equilibrium ionization and cooling module that follows 136 ions.
The simulations reproduce the observed correlation, revealed by COS-Halos at
z~0.2, between O VI column density at impact parameters b < 150 kpc and the
specific star formation rate (sSFR=SFR/Mstar) of the central galaxy at z~0.2.
We find that the column density of circumgalactic O VI is maximal in the haloes
associated with Lstar galaxies, because their virial temperatures are close to
the temperature at which the ionization fraction of O VI peaks (T~10^5.5 K).
The higher virial temperature of group haloes (> 10^6 K) promotes oxygen to
higher ionization states, suppressing the O VI column density. The observed NO
VI-sSFR correlation therefore does not imply a causal link, but reflects the
changing characteristic ionization state of oxygen as halo mass is increased.
In spite of the mass-dependence of the oxygen ionization state, the most
abundant circumgalactic oxygen ion in both Lstar and group haloes is O VII; O
VI accounts for only 0.1% of the oxygen in group haloes and 0.9-1.3% with Lstar
haloes. Nonetheless, the metals traced by O VI absorbers represent a fossil
record of the feedback history of galaxies over a Hubble time; their
characteristic epoch of ejection corresponds to z > 1 and much of the ejected
metal mass resides beyond the virial radius of galaxies. For both Lstar and
group galaxies, more of the oxygen produced and released by stars resides in
the circumgalactic medium (within twice the virial radius) than in the stars
and ISM of the galaxy.

matrix. The typical method used for such computations is the Hutchinson method
which is a Monte Carlo (MC) averaging over matrix quadratures. To improve its
convergence, several variance reductions techniques have been proposed. In this
paper, we study the effects of deflating the near null singular value space. We
make two main contributions.
  First, we analyze the variance of the Hutchinson method as a function of the
deflated singular values and vectors. Although this provides good intuition in
general, by assuming additionally that the singular vectors are random unitary
matrices, we arrive at concise formulas for the deflated variance that include
only the variance and mean of the singular values. We make the remarkable
observation that deflation may increase variance for Hermitian matrices but not
for non-Hermitian ones. This is a rare, if not unique, property where
non-Hermitian matrices outperform Hermitian ones. The theory can be used as a
model for predicting the benefits of deflation.
  Second, we use deflation in the context of a large scale application of
""disconnected diagrams"" in Lattice QCD. On lattices, Hierarchical Probing (HP)
has previously provided an order of magnitude of variance reduction over MC by
removing ""error"" from neighboring nodes of increasing distance in the lattice.
Although deflation used directly on MC yields a limited improvement of 30% in
our problem, when combined with HP they reduce variance by a factor of over 60
compared to MC. For this, we pre-computated 1000 smallest singular values of an
ill-conditioned matrix of size 25 million. Using PRIMME and a domain-specific
Algebraic Multigrid preconditioner, we perform one of the largest eigenvalue
computations in Lattice QCD at a fraction of the cost of our trace computation.

associated with designing interactions to stabilize self-assembled structures

isotropic,convex-repulsive pair potentials that maximize the density range for
which a two-dimensional square lattice is the stable ground state subject to a
constraint on the chemical potential advantage it exhibits over competing
structures (i.e., 'depth' of the associated minimum on the chemical potential
hypersurface). We formulate the design problem as a non-linear program, which
we solve numerically. This allows us to efficiently find optimized interactions
for a wide range of possible chemical potential constraints. We find that
assemblies designed to exhibit a large chemical potential advantage at a
specified density have a smaller overall range of densities for which they are
stable. This trend can be understood by considering the separation-dependent
features of the pair potential and its gradient required to enhance the
stability of the target structure relative to competitors. Using molecular
dynamics simulations, we further show that potentials designed with larger
chemical potential advantages exhibit higher melting temperatures.

Gillet-Soule are replaced with complex valued logarithms. On the determinant of
cohomology side, the idea goes back to Fay's holomorphic extension of
determinants of Dolbeault laplacians, and it is shown here to be equivalent to
the holomorphic Cappell-Miller torsion. On the Deligne pairing side, the
logarithm is a refinement of the intersection connections considered in
previous work. The construction naturally leads to an Arakelov theory for flat
line bundles on arithmetic surfaces and produces arithmetic intersection
numbers valued in ${\mathbb C}/\pi i {\mathbb Z}$. In this context we prove an
arithmetic Riemann-Roch theorem. This realizes a program proposed by
Cappell-Miller to show that the holomorphic torsion exhibits properties similar
to those of the Quillen metric proved by Bismut, Gillet and Soule. Finally, we
give examples that clarify the kind of invariants that the formalism captures;
namely, periods of differential forms.

physical properties of a large sample (~4000 galaxies) of spectroscopically
confirmed faint (i_{AB}<~25 mag) star-forming galaxies, with and without Lyman
alpha in emission, at z~2-6. The fraction of Lyman alpha emitters (LAEs;
equivalent width (EW)=>20A) increases from ~10% at z~2 to ~40% at z~5-6, which
is consistent with previous studies that employ higher Lyman alpha EW cut. This
increase in the LAE fraction could be, in part, due to a decrease in the dust
content of galaxies as redshift increases. When we compare best-fit SED
estimated stellar parameters for LAEs and non-LAEs, we find that E(B-V) is
smaller for LAEs at all redshifts and the difference in the median E(B-V)
between LAEs and non-LAEs increases as redshift increases, from 0.05 at z~2 to
0.1 at z~3.5 to 0.2 at z~5-6. For the luminosities probed here (~L*), we find
that star formation rates (SFRs) and stellar masses of galaxies, with and
without Lyman alpha in emission, show small differences such that, LAEs have
lower SFRs and stellar masses compared to non-LAEs. This result could be a
direct consequence of the sample selection. Our sample of LAEs are selected
based on their continuum magnitudes and they probe higher continuum
luminosities compared to narrow-band/emission line selected LAEs. Based on our
results, it is important to note that all LAEs are not universally similar and
their properties are strongly dependent on the sample selection, and/or
continuum luminosities.

$f^{(\nu)}$-models), originally constructed in the context of violent
relaxation and modeling of elliptical galaxies, has been found to possess
interesting qualities in relation to observed and simulated globular clusters.
In view of new applications to globular clusters, we improve this class of
models along two directions. To make them more suitable for the description of
small stellar systems hosted by galaxies, we introduce a 'tidal' truncation (by
means of a procedure that guarantees full continuity of the distribution
function). The new $f_T^{(\nu)}$-models are shown to provide a better fit to
the observed photometric and spectroscopic profiles for a sample of 13 globular
clusters studied earlier by means of non-truncated models; interestingly, the
best-fit models also perform better with respect to the radial-orbit
instability. Then we design a flexible but simple two-component family of
truncated models, to study the separate issues of mass segregation and of
multiple populations. We do not aim at a fully realistic description of
globular clusters, to compete with the description currently obtained by means
of dedicated simulations. The goal here is to try to identify the simplest
models, that is, those with the smallest number of free parameters, but still
able to provide a reasonable description for clusters that are evidently beyond
the reach of one-component models: with this tool we aim at identifying the key
factors that characterize mass segregation or the presence of multiple
populations. To reduce the relevant parameter space, we formulate a few
physical arguments (based on recent observations and simulations). A first
application to two well-studied globular clusters is briefly described and
discussed.

scalar dark matter models obtained by combining Planck data on the cosmic

limits from the Fermi Large Area Telescope. We find that for real scalars
indirect dark matter searches disfavour a dark matter particle mass below 100
GeV. For the complex scalar dark matter particle current data have a limited
impact due to the presence of operators that lead to p-wave annihilation, and
also do not contribute to the spin-independent scattering cross- section.
Although current data are not informative enough to strongly constrain the
theory parameter space, we demonstrate the power of our formalism to
reconstruct the theoretical parameters compatible with an actual dark matter
detection, by assuming that the excess of gamma rays observed by the Fermi
Large Area Telescope towards the Galactic centre is entirely due to dark matter
annihilations. Please note that the excess can very well be due to
astrophysical sources such as millisecond pulsars. We find that scalar dark
matter interacting via effective field theory operators can in principle
explain the Galactic centre excess, but that such interpretation is in strong
tension with the non-detection of gamma rays from dwarf galaxies in the real
scalar case. In the complex scalar case there is enough freedom to relieve the
tension.

2.3125 $\mu$m, thus constraining the effect of jitter at these wavelengths. We
provide the first multi-wavelength confirmation of GJ 876 bc and independently
retrieve orbital parameters consistent with previous studies. We recovered RV
variability for HD 160934 AB and GJ 725 AB that are consistent with their known
binary orbits, and nine other targets are candidate RV variables with a
statistical significance of 3-5$\sigma$. Our method combined with the new
iSHELL spectrograph will yield long-term RV precisions of $\lesssim$ 5 m
s$^{-1}$ in the NIR, which will allow the detection of Super-Earths near the
habitable zone of mid-M dwarfs.

attempt to rectify these issues we modify the original literature TFA by
including measurement uncertainties in its computation, including ancillary
data correlated with noise, and algorithmically selecting a template set using
clustering algorithms as suggested by various authors. This approach may be
particularly useful for appropriately accounting for variable photometric
precision surveys and/or combined data-sets. In summary, our contributions are
to provide a MATLAB software implementation of TFA and a number of
modifications tested on synthetics and real data, summarize the performance of
TFA and various modifications on real ground based data sets (2MASS and PTF),

This problem is motivated by the so-called kidney exchange problem, but has
potential other applications and is interesting in its own right.
  We propose a new algorithm for this problem based on the message
passing/belief propagation technique. A priori this problem does not have an
associated graphical model, so in order to apply a belief propagation algorithm
we provide a novel representation of the problem as a graphical model. Standard
belief propagation on this model has poor scaling behavior, so we provide an
efficient implementation that significantly decreases the complexity. We
provide numerical results comparing the performance of our algorithm on both
artificially created graphs and real world networks to several alternative
algorithms, including algorithms based on integer programming (IP) techniques.
These comparisons show that our algorithm scales better to large instances than
IP-based algorithms and often finds better solutions than a simple algorithm
that greedily selects the longest path from each root node. In some cases it
also finds better solutions than the ones found by IP-based algorithms even
when the latter are allowed to run significantly longer than our algorithm.

A salient feature of the rate function in both cases is that, unlike
rotationally invariant random matrices, it is asymmetric with respect to its
minimum. The asymmetric character depends on the disorder in a way that is
compatible with the distinct eigenvalue statistics corresponding to localized

$\sigma_{N}^{2} \propto N$ ($N \gg 1$) for any nonzero disorder, which is

that the Fermi arc transport is dissipative. The origin of the dissipation is
the scattering of the surface Fermi arc states into the bulk of the semimetal.
It is noticeable that corresponding scattering rate is nonzero and can be
estimated even in a perturbative theory, although in general the reliable
calculations of transport properties necessitate a nonperturbative approach.
Nondecoupling of the surface and bulk sectors in the low-energy theory of Weyl
semimetals invalidates the usual argument of a nondissipative transport due to
one-dimensional arc states. This property of Weyl semimetals is in drastic
contrast to that of topological insulators, where the decoupling is protected
by a gap in the bulk. Within the framework of the linear response theory, we
obtain an approximate result for the conductivity due to the Fermi arc states

range of 0.01<z<0.23. To derive the physical properties of the galaxies we rely
on ultraviolet (UV)-to-infrared spectral energy distribution modeling, using
CIGALE. Our results suggest that during the 3 Gyr period covered by our sample,
the star formation activity of galaxies in our groups has been substantially
reduced (3-10 times). Moreover, their star formation histories as well as their
UV-optical and mid-infrared colors are significantly different from those of
field and cluster galaxies, indicating that compact group galaxies spend more
time transitioning through the green valley. The morphological transformation
from late-type spirals into early-type galaxies occurs in the mid-infrared
transition zone rather than in the UV-optical green valley. We find evidence of
shocks in the emission line ratios and gas velocity dispersions of the
late-type galaxies located below the star forming main sequence. Our results
suggest that in addition to gas stripping, turbulence and shocks might play an
important role in suppressing the star formation in compact group galaxies.

that has not been thoroughly evaluated yet is deformable face tracking
""in-the-wild"". Until now, the performance has mainly been assessed
qualitatively by visually assessing the result of a deformable face tracking
technology on short videos. In this paper, we perform the first, to the best of
our knowledge, thorough evaluation of state-of-the-art deformable face tracking
pipelines using the recently introduced 300VW benchmark. We evaluate many
different architectures focusing mainly on the task of on-line deformable face
tracking. In particular, we compare the following general strategies: (a)
generic face detection plus generic facial landmark localisation, (b) generic
model free tracking plus generic facial landmark localisation, as well as (c)
hybrid approaches using state-of-the-art face detection, model free tracking
and facial landmark localisation technologies. Our evaluation reveals future
avenues for further research on the topic.

to be a scientific rather than a mathematical problem. The assumptions involved
in the current definition of the P?=NP problem as a problem involving non
deterministic Turing Machines (NDTMs) from axiomatic automata theory are
criticized. The problem is also shown to be neither a problem in pure nor
applied mathematics. The details of The MRAM model and the well known Hartmanis
and Simon construction that shows how to code and simulate NDTMs on MRAM
machines is described. Since the computation power of MRAMs is the same as
NDTMs, P is equal to NP. The paper shows that the justification for the NDTM
P?=NP problem using a letter from Kurt Godel to John Von Neumann is incorrect
by showing Von Neumann explicitly rejected automata models of computation
hardness and used his computer architecture for modeling computation that is
exactly the MRAM model. The paper argues that Deolalikar's scientific solution

scale up a quantum heat engine utilizing a many-particle working medium in

this end, we first analyze the finite-time thermodynamics of a quantum Otto

the adiabatic performance using a variety of shortcuts to adiabaticity. As a
result, the nonadiabatic dynamics of the scaled-up many-particle quantum heat
engine exhibits no friction and the cycle can be run at maximum efficiency with
a tunable output power. We demonstrate our results with a working medium
consisting of particles with inverse-square pairwise interactions, that

is specifically designed to evade detection mechanisms, spreading dormant, in
the wild for extended periods of time, gathering sensitive information or
positioning itself for a high-impact zero-day attack. Policing the growing
attack surface requires the development of efficient anti-malware solutions
with improved generalization to detect novel types of malware and resolve these
occurrences with as little burden on human experts as possible. In this paper,
we survey malicious stealth technologies as well as existing solutions for
detecting and categorizing these countermeasures autonomously. While machine
learning offers promising potential for increasingly autonomous solutions with
improved generalization to new malware types, both at the network level and at
the host level, our findings suggest that several flawed assumptions inherent
to most recognition algorithms prevent a direct mapping between the stealth
malware recognition problem and a machine learning solution. The most notable
of these flawed assumptions is the closed world assumption: that no sample
belonging to a class outside of a static training set will appear at query
time. We present a formalized adaptive open world framework for stealth malware
recognition and relate it mathematically to research from other machine

graph-regularized norm, we propose a novel sparse graph-regularized SVD as a
powerful biclustering tool for analyzing high-dimensional data. The key of this
method is to impose two penalties including a novel graph-regularized norm
($|\pmb{u}|\pmb{L}|\pmb{u}|$) and $L_0$-norm ($\|\pmb{u}\|_0$) on singular
vectors to induce structural sparsity and enhance interpretability. We design
an efficient Alternating Iterative Sparse Projection (AISP) algorithm to solve
it. Finally, we apply our method and related ones to simulated and real data to
show its efficiency in capturing natural blocking structures.

texture image processing and texture analysis. The key concept of fractal-based
image model is the fractal dimension, which is invariant to bi-Lipschitz
transformation of image, and thus capable of representing intrinsic structural
information of image robustly. However, the invariance of fractal dimension
generally does not hold after filtering, which limits the application of
fractal-based image model. In this paper, we propose a novel fractal dimension
invariant filtering (FDIF) method, extending the invariance of fractal
dimension to filtering operations. Utilizing the notion of local
self-similarity, we first develop a local fractal model for images. By adding a
nonlinear post-processing step behind anisotropic filter banks, we demonstrate
that the proposed filtering method is capable of preserving the local
invariance of the fractal dimension of image. Meanwhile, we show that the FDIF
method can be re-instantiated approximately via a CNN-based architecture, where
the convolution layer extracts anisotropic structure of image and the nonlinear
layer enhances the structure via preserving local fractal dimension of image.
The proposed filtering method provides us with a novel geometric interpretation
of CNN-based image model. Focusing on a challenging image processing task ---
detecting complicated curves from the texture-like images, the proposed method
obtains superior results to the state-of-art approaches.

massive gravity, which adds to the ones usually encountered in general
relativity (GR). In the unitary gauge $\phi^a=x^\mu\delta_\mu^a$, any inverse
metric $g^{\mu\nu}$ that has divergence including the coordinate singularity in
GR would exhibit a singularity in the invariant $I^{ab}$. Therefore, there is
no conventional Schwarzschild metric if we choose unitary gauge. In this paper,
we obtain a self-consistent static spherically symmetric ansatz in the
nonunitary gauge. Under this ansatz, we find that there are seven solutions
including the Schwarzschild solution, Reissner-Nordstr\""{o}m solution and five
other solutions. These solutions may possess an event horizon depending upon
the physical parameters (Schwarzschild radius $r_s$, scalar charge $S$ and/or

the singularity of $I^{ab}$ is absent at the horizon. Therefore, these

create a well-formed circle. The two innovations we introduce are:
  1. The first, relating to the limitations that apply to any finding in the

variational tensor network methods in 2D are still not as successful as in 1D.
However, this is not necessarily the case if the tensor network represents a
gapped ground state of a local Hamiltonian; such states are subject to many
constraints and contain much more structure. In this paper we introduce a new
approach for approximating the expectation value of a local observable in
ground states of local Hamiltonians that are represented as PEPS

estimate the expectation value using only a local patch of the tensor-network

to do when the system is frustrated. In such case, the spanning vectors of the
local patch are subject to non-trivial constraints that can be utilized via a
semi-definite program to calculate rigorous lower- and upper-bounds on the
expectation value. We test our approach in 1D systems, where we show how the
expectation value can be calculated up to at least 3 or 4 digits of precision,
even when the patch radius is smaller than the correlation length.

Standard and Poor's (S\&P 500) portfolio (see \cite{Bloom}, \cite{Uppal},
\cite{Jacobs}, \cite{Treynor}). However, portfolio allocation based on Tukey's
transformational ladde have, rather surprisingly, remained absent from the
literature. In this work, we consider the S\&P 500 portfolio over the 1958-2015
time horizon weighted by Tukey's transformational ladder (\cite{Tukey2}):
$1/x^2,\,\, 1/x,\,\, 1/\sqrt{x},\,\, \text{log}(x),\,\, \sqrt{x},\,\, x,\,\,
\text{and} \,\, x^2$, where $x$ is defined as the market capitalization
weighted S\&P 500 portfolio. Accounting for dividends and transaction fees, we
find that the 1/$x^2$ weighting strategy produces cumulative returns that
significantly dominates all other portfolios, achieving a compound annual
growth rate of 18\% over the 1958-2015 horizon. Our story is furthered by a
startling phenomenon: both the cumulative and annual returns of the $1/x^2$
weighting strategy are superior to those of the $1/x$ weighting strategy, which
are in turn superior to those of the 1/$\sqrt{x}$ weighted portfolio, and so
forth, ending with the $x^2$ transformation, whose cumulative returns are the
lowest of the seven transformations of Tukey's transformational ladder. The
order of cumulative returns precisely follows that of Tukey's transformational
ladder. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to discover this
phenomenon.

Visual Question Generation (VQG), where the system is tasked with asking a

considerably more abstract training data than provided to state-of-the-art

models ask reasonable questions for a variety of images, there is still a wide
gap with human performance which motivates further work on connecting images
with commonsense knowledge and pragmatics. Our proposed task offers a new
challenge to the community which we hope furthers interest in exploring deeper

by lack of abundant labeled samples. In this paper we propose a technique for
domain adaptation in stacked autoencoder (SAE) based deep neural networks (DNN)
performed in two stages: (i) unsupervised weight adaptation using systematic
dropouts in mini-batch training, (ii) supervised fine-tuning with limited
number of labeled samples in target domain. We experimentally evaluate
performance in the problem of retinal vessel segmentation where the SAE-DNN is
trained using large number of labeled samples in the source domain (DRIVE
dataset) and adapted using less number of labeled samples in target domain
(STARE dataset). The performance of SAE-DNN measured using $logloss$ in source
domain is $0.19$, without and with adaptation are $0.40$ and $0.18$, and $0.39$
when trained exclusively with limited samples in target domain. The area under
ROC curve is observed respectively as $0.90$, $0.86$, $0.92$ and $0.87$. The
high efficiency of vessel segmentation with DASA strongly substantiates our

Mo-M$_{2,3}$ edges represents an interesting alternative as they are situated
close to the O-K edges. They should allow thus the extraction of a wealth of
chemical information from the same spectra. However the main difficulty to
overcome in order to work properly with these edges is the delayed maxima of
the Mo-M$_{4,5}$ edges which hinders the automated background subtraction with
the usual inverse power low function. In this study we propose another
background subtraction method specifically designed to overcome this obstacle
and we apply it to the study of MoO3 and MoO2. We are able to show that
quantitative chemical information can be precisely and accurately determined
from the joined analyze of O-K and Mo-M$_{2,3}$ edges. In particular k-factors
are derived as a function of the integration window width and standard errors
close to 2% are reported. The possibility to discriminate the two oxides thanks
to chemical shifts and energy-loss near-edge structures is also investigated

be strongly dependent on the local chemical environment. This result is
confirmed by multiplet calculations for which the crystal field parameters have

experimentally in InAs/GaSb quantum wells as a result of inverted band
structures, for which electron bands in InAs layers are below heavy hole bands
in GaSb layers in energy. The hybridization between electron bands and heavy
hole bands leads to a hybridization gap away from k=0. A recent puzzling
observation in experiments is that when the system is tuned to more inverted
regime by a gate voltage (a larger inverted gap at k=0), the hybridization gap
decreases. Motivated by this experiment, we explore the dependence of
hybridization gap as a function of external electric fields based on the
eight-band Kane model. We identify two regimes when varying electric fields:
(1) both inverted and hybridization gaps increase and (2) inverted gap
increases while hybridization gap decreases. Based on the effective model, we
find that light-hole bands in GaSb layers play an important role in determining
hybridization gap. In addition, a large external electric field can induce a
strong Rashba splitting and also influence hybridization gap.

literature using two complementary approaches. Distributional methods, whose
supervised variants are the current best performers, and path-based methods,
which received less research attention. We suggest an improved path-based
algorithm, in which the dependency paths are encoded using a recurrent neural
network, that achieves results comparable to distributional methods. We then
extend the approach to integrate both path-based and distributional signals,
significantly improving upon the state-of-the-art on this task.

flare from its early phase. Flare loops are seen to slip in opposite directions
towards both ends of the ribbons. Velocities of 20--40 km\,s$^{-1}$ are found
within time windows where the slipping is well resolved. The warm coronal loops
exhibit expanding and contracting motions that are interpreted as displacements
due to the growing flux rope that subsequently erupts. This flux rope existed
and erupted before the onset of apparent coronal implosion. This indicates that
the energy release proceeds by slipping reconnection and not via coronal
implosion. The slipping reconnection leads to changes in the geometry of the
observed structures at the \textit{IRIS} slit position, from flare loop top to
the footpoints in the ribbons. This results in variations of the observed
velocities of chromospheric evaporation in the early flare phase. Finally, it
is found that the precursor signatures including localized EUV brightenings as
well as non-thermal X-ray emission are signatures of the flare itself,
progressing from the early phase towards the impulsive phase, with the
tether-cutting being provided by the slipping reconnection. The dynamics of
both the flare and outlying coronal loops is found to be consistent with the
predictions of the standard solar flare model in 3D.

temperature, this compound exhibits a gap opening with an energy shift of

strongly suppressed, however, with further decrease of temperature, and
eventually vanish at the lowest temperature, leaving a non-dispersive flat band

trees, we demonstrate that several hundreds to tens of thousands of low-mass
Pop~III stars escape from the building blocks of the Milky Way.
  The second and later generations of extremely metal-poor (EMP) stars are also
escaped from the mini-halos.
  We discuss the spatial distributions of these escaped stars by evaluating the
distances between the mini-halos in the branches of merger trees under the
spherical collapse model of dark matter halos.
  It is demonstrated that the escaped stars distribute beyond the stellar halo
with a density profile close to the dark matter halo, while the Pop~III stars
are slightly more centrally concentrated .
  Some escaped stars leave the Milky Way and spread into the intergalactic
space.
  Based on the results, we discuss the feasibility of observing the Pop~III
stars with the pristine surface abundance.

adhered to an aluminum-coated glass substrate is studied using a laser-induced
spallation technique. The microsphere-substrate adhesion force is estimated
from substrate surface displacement measurements obtained using optical
interferometry, and a rigid-body model that accounts for the inertia of the
microspheres. The estimated adhesion force is compared with estimates obtained
from interferometric measurement of the out-of-plane microsphere contact
resonance. Reasonable agreement is found between the two experiments. Scanning
electron microscope images of detached monolayer regions reveal a unique

improved understanding of microsphere adhesion and demonstrates a unique

we prove that for relativistic (and non-relativistic) tops such Lax pairs with
spectral parameter follow from the associative Yang-Baxter equation and its
degenerations. Then we proceed to matrix extensions of the models and find out
that some additional constraints are required for their construction. We
describe a matrix version of ${\mathbb Z}_2$ reduced elliptic top and verify
that the latter constraints are fulfilled in this case. The construction of
matrix extensions is naturally generalized to the monodromy preserving
equation. In this way we get matrix extensions of the Painlev\'e VI equation
and its multidimensional analogues written in the form of non-autonomous
elliptic tops. Finally, it is mentioned that the matrix valued variables can be
replaced by elements of noncommutative associative algebra. In the end of the
