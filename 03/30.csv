numerous applications ranging from the formation of elements in the r-process
to fuel cycle optimization for nuclear energy. The need for a predictive theory
applicable where no data is available is an incentive to develop a fully
microscopic approach to fission dynamics. In this work, we calculate the
pre-neutron emission charge and mass distributions of the fission fragments
formed in the neutron-induced fission of 239Pu using a microscopic method based
on nuclear energy density functional (EDF) method, where large amplitude
collective motion is treated adiabatically using the time dependent generator
coordinate method (TDGCM) under the Gaussian overlap approximation (GOA).
Fission fragment distributions are extracted from the flux of the collective
wave packet through the scission line. We find that the main characteristics of
the fission charge and mass distributions can be well reproduced by existing
energy functionals even in two-dimensional collective spaces. Theory and
experiment agree typically within 2 mass units for the position of the
asymmetric peak. As expected, calculations are sensitive to the structure of
the initial state and the prescription for the collective inertia. We emphasize
that results are also sensitive to the continuity of the collective landscape
near scission. Our analysis confirms that the adiabatic approximation provides
an effective scheme to compute fission fragment yields. It also suggests that,
at least in the framework of nuclear DFT, three-dimensional collective spaces
may be a prerequisite to reach 10% accuracy in predicting pre-neutron emission
fission fragment yields.

we present a technique that combines natural language processing with a

apply this technique across 1.8 billion words of fiction from the Wattpad

male and female characters behave and are described, and how authors' use of
gender stereotypes is associated with the community's ratings. We find that
male over-representation and traditional gender stereotypes (e.g., dominant men
and submissive women) are common throughout nearly every genre in our corpus.
However, only some of these stereotypes, like sexual or violent men, are
associated with highly rated stories. Finally, despite women often being the
target of negative stereotypes, female authors are equally likely to write such
stereotypes as men.

coming from oscillations requires extending the SM with at least right-handed
neutrinos with a Dirac mass term. In turn, this implies extending the CMSSM
with right-handed sneutrino superpartners, a scenario we dub $\tilde\nu$CMSSM.
These additional states constitute alternative dark matter candidates of the
superWIMP type, produced via the decay of the long-lived next-to-lightest SUSY

NLSP is a $\tilde{\tau}$: despite the modest extension with respect to the

particles. After taking into account the role played by neutrino mass bounds
and the specific cosmological bounds from the big bang nucleosynthesis in
selecting the viable parameter space, we discuss the excellent discovery
prospects for this model at the future runs of the LHC. We show that it is
possible to probe $\tilde{\tau}$ masses up to 600 GeV at the 14 TeV LHC with
$\mathcal{L} = 1100$ fb$^{-1}$ when one considers a pair production of staus
with two or more hard jets through all SUSY processes. We also show the
complementary discovery prospects from a direct $\tilde{\tau}$ pair production,

X-ray variations. We assembled the X-ray spectral parameters and variability
patterns, which were obtained from simultaneous spectral fittings. Major
differences are observed in the X-ray luminosities, and the Eddington ratios,
which are higher in Seyfert 2s. Short-term X-ray variations were not detected,
while long-term changes are common in LINERs and Seyfert 2s. Compton-thick
sources generally do not show variations, most probably because the AGN is not
accesible in the 0.5--10 keV energy band. The changes are mostly related with
variations in the nuclear continuum, but other patterns of variability show
that variations in the absorbers and at soft energies can be present in a few
cases. We conclude that the X-ray variations may occur similarly in LINERs and
Seyfert 2s, i.e., they are related to the nuclear continuum, although they
might have different accretion mechanisms. Variations at UV frequencies are
detected in LINER nuclei but not in Seyfert 2s. This is suggestive of at least
some LINERs having an unobstructed view of the inner disc where the UV emission
might take place, being UV variations common in them. This result might be
compatible with the disappeareance of the torus and/or the broad line region in

This ensures that their imaginary parts are consistent with the observed widths
of the D-mesons. The lowest odd- and even-parity, strange and nonstrange charm
mesons provide enough constraints to determine only certain linear combinations
of the low-energy constants (LECs) in the effective Lagrangian. We comment on
how lattice QCD could provide further information to disentangle these

from our theory are in good agreement with experimentally measured masses for
the case of the odd-parity sector. For the even-parity sector, the B-meson

a fraction of players have access to high accuracy information about traffic
incidents relative to others. To model such environments, we introduce a
Bayesian congestion game, in which players have private information about
incidents, and each player chooses her route on a network of parallel links.
The links are prone to incidents that occur with an ex-ante known probability.
The demand is comprised of two player populations: one with access to high
accuracy incident information and another with low accuracy information, i.e.
the populations differ only by their access to information. The common
knowledge includes: (i) the demand and route cost functions, (ii) the fraction
of highly-informed players, (iii) the incident probability, and (iv) the
marginal type distributions induced by the information structure of the game.
We present a full characterization of the Bayesian Wardrop Equilibrium of this
game under the assumption that low information players receive no additional
information beyond common knowledge. We also compute the cost to individual
players and the social cost as a function of the fraction of highly-informed
players when they receive perfectly accurate information. Our first result
suggests that below a certain threshold of highly-informed players, both
populations experience a reduction in individual cost, with the highly-informed
players receiving a greater reduction. However, above this threshold, both
populations realize the same equilibrium cost. Secondly, there exists another
(lower or equal) threshold above which a further increase in the fraction of
highly-informed players does not reduce the expected social costs. Thus, once a
sufficiently large number of players are highly informed, wider distribution of
more accurate information is ineffective at best, and otherwise socially
harmful.

Solar energetic particles observed in association with coronal mass
ejections (CMEs) are produced by the CME-driven shock waves. The acceleration
of particles is considered to be due to diffusive shock acceleration (DSA).
Aims. We aim at a better understanding of DSA in the case of quasi-parallel
shocks, in which self-generated turbulence in the shock vicinity plays a key
role. Methods. We have developed and applied a new Monte Carlo simulation code
for acceleration of protons in parallel coronal shocks. The code performs a
self-consistent calculation of resonant interactions of particles with Alfv\'en
waves based on the quasi-linear theory. In contrast to the existing Monte Carlo
codes of DSA, the new code features the full quasi-linear resonance condition
of particle pitch-angle scattering. This allows us to take anisotropy of
particle pitch-angle scattering into account, while the older codes implement
an approximate resonance condition leading to isotropic scattering.We performed
simulations with the new code and with an old code, applying the same initial
and boundary conditions, and have compared the results provided by both codes
with each other, and with the predictions of the steady-state theory. Results.
We have found that anisotropic pitch-angle scattering leads to less efficient
acceleration of particles than isotropic. However, extrapolations to particle
injection rates higher than those we were able to use suggest the capability of
DSA to produce relativistic particles. The particle and wave distributions in
the foreshock as well as their time evolution, provided by our new simulation
code, are significantly different from the previous results and from the
steady-state theory. Specifically, the mean free path in the simulations with
the new code is increasing with energy, in contrast to the theoretical result.

we study the relativistic generalization of the $\kappa$--deformed Landau
levels as well as the consequences of the deformation on the Hall conductivity.
By comparing the $\kappa$--deformed Landau levels in the nonrelativistic regime
with the energy levels of a two-dimensional electron gas (2DEG) in the presence
of a normal magnetic field, upper bounds for the deformation parameter in
different materials are established. An expression for the $\kappa$--deformed
Hall conductivity of a 2DEG is obtained as well. The expression recovers the
well-known result for the usual Hall conductivity in the limit
$\varepsilon=\kappa^{-1}\to 0$. The deformation parameter breaks the Landau
levels degeneracy and due to this, it is observed that deformation gives rise
to new plateaus of conductivity in a such way that the plateaus widths of the
$\kappa$--deformed Hall conductivity are less than the usual one. By studying
the temperature dependence of the $\kappa$--deformed Hall conductivity, we show
that an increase of the temperature causes the smearing of the plateaus and a
diminution of the effect of the deformation, whilst an increase in the magnetic
field enhances the effect of the deformation.

used in RAW-Feldspar which is a complete rewrite of the Feldspar embedded
domain-specific language (EDSL) (Axelsson et al. 2010). Feldspar is high-level
functional language that generates efficient C code to run on embedded targets.
The gist of the technique presented in this post is the following: rather
writing a back end that converts pure Feldspar expressions directly to C, we
translate them to a low-level monadic EDSL. From the low-level EDSL, C code is
then generated. This approach has several advantages:
  1. The translation is simpler to write than a complete C back end.
  2. The translation is between two typed EDSLs, which rules out many potential
errors.
  3. The low-level EDSL is reusable and can be shared between several
high-level EDSLs.
  Although the article contains a lot of code, most of it is in fact reusable.
As mentioned in Discussion, we can write the same implementation in less than

traditional Swedish readability measure, L\""asbarhetsindex (LIX), is not
suitable for this task, we propose a supervised machine learning model, based
on a range of linguistic features, that can reliably classify texts according
to their difficulty level. Our model obtained an accuracy of 81.3% and an
F-score of 0.8, which is comparable to the state of the art in English and is
considerably higher than previously reported results for other languages. We
further studied the utility of our features with single sentences instead of
full texts since sentences are a common linguistic unit in language learning
exercises. We trained a separate model on sentence-level data with five
classes, which yielded 63.4% accuracy. Although this is lower than the document
level performance, we achieved an adjacent accuracy of 92%. Furthermore, we
found that using a combination of different features, compared to using lexical
features alone, resulted in 7% improvement in classification accuracy at the

dominant. Our models are intended for use in a freely accessible web-based

super-luminous supernovae. We study their high-energy signatures, focusing on
the role of pair-enriched bubbles produced by young magnetars, rapidly-rotating
neutron stars, and magnetized white dwarfs. (i) First, we study the nebular
properties and the conditions allowing for escape of high-energy gamma-rays and
radio waves, showing that their escape is possible for nebulae with ages of
>10-100 yr. In the rapidly-rotating neutron star scenario, we find that radio
emission from the quasi-steady nebula itself may be bright enough to be
detected especially at sub-mm frequencies, which is relevant as a possible
counterpart of pulsar-driven SNe and FRBs. (ii) Second, we consider the fate of
bursting emission in the nebulae. We suggest that an impulsive burst may lead
to a highly relativistic flow, which would interact with the nebula. If the
shocked nebula is still relativistic, pre-existing non-thermal particles in the
nebula can be significantly boosted by the forward shock, leading to
short-duration (maybe millisecond or longer) high-energy gamma-ray flashes.
Possible dissipation at the reverse shock may also lead to gamma-ray emission.
(iii) After such flares, interactions with the baryonic ejecta may lead to
afterglow emission with a duration of days to weeks. In the magnetar scenario,
this burst-in-bubble model leads to the expectation that nearby (<10-100 Mpc)
high-energy gamma-ray flashes may be detected by HAWC and CTA, and the
subsequent afterglow emission may be seen by radio telescopes such as VLA. (iv)
Finally, we discuss several implications specific to FRBs, including
constraints on the emission regions and limits on soft gamma-ray counterparts.

that the frequency structure seen across the individual 1.4 and 2-GHz

current in the nucleon at fixed light-front time. At peripheral distances b =
O(M_pi^{-1}) the densities are governed by chiral dynamics and can be
calculated model-independently using chiral effective field theory (EFT).
Recent work has shown that the EFT results can be represented in
first-quantized form, as overlap integrals of chiral light-front wave functions
describing the transition of the nucleon to soft-pion-nucleon intermediate
states, resulting in a quantum-mechanical picture of the peripheral transverse
densities. We now extend this representation to include intermediate states
with Delta isobars and implement relations based on the large-N_c limit of QCD.
We derive the wave function overlap formulas for the Delta contributions to the
peripheral transverse densities by way of a three-dimensional reduction of
relativistic chiral EFT expressions. Our procedure effectively maintains
rotational invariance and avoids the ambiguities with higher-spin particles in
the light-front time-ordered approach. We study the interplay of pi-N and
pi-Delta intermediate states in the quantum-mechanical picture of the densities
in a transversely polarized nucleon. We show that the correct N_c-scaling of
the charge and magnetization densities emerges as the result of the particular
combination of currents generated by intermediate states with degenerate N and
Delta. The off-shell behavior of the chiral EFT is summarized in contact terms
and can be studied easily. The methods developed here can be applied to other
peripheral densities and to moments of the nucleon's generalized parton
distributions.

observed in the X-ray band. Despite being observed for decades, the macroscopic
transport properties of the ICM are still not well-constrained. A path to
determine macroscopic ICM properties opened up with the discovery of ""cold
fronts"". These were observed as sharp discontinuities in surface brightness and
temperature in the ICM, with the property that the brighter (and denser) side
of the discontinuity is the colder one. The high spatial resolution of the
Chandra X-ray Observatory revealed two puzzles about the cold fronts. First,
they should be subject to Kelvin-Helmholtz instabilites, yet in many cases they
appear relatively smooth and undisturbed. Second, the width of the interface
between the two gas phases is typically narrower than the mean free path of the
particles in the plasma, indicating negligible thermal conduction. From the
time of their discovery, it was realized that these special characteristics of
cold fronts may be used to probe the physical properties of the cluster plasma.
In this review, we will discuss the recent simulations of cold front formation
and evolution in galaxy clusters, with a focus on those which have attempted to
use these features to constrain the physics of the ICM. In particular, we will
focus on the effects of magnetic fields, viscosity, and thermal conductivity on
the stability properties and long-term evolution of cold fronts. We conclude
with a discussion on what important questions remain unanswered, and the future

minimal set of vertices whose removal leaves the network broken into connected
components of sub-extensive size. For a large class of random graphs, this
problem is tightly connected to the decycling problem (the removal of vertices
leaving the graph acyclic). Exploiting this connection and recent works on
epidemic spreading we present precise predictions for the minimal size of a
dismantling set in a large random graph with a prescribed (light-tailed) degree
distribution. Building on the statistical mechanics perspective we propose a
three-stage Min-Sum algorithm for efficiently dismantling networks, including
heavy-tailed ones for which the dismantling and decycling problems are not
equivalent. We also provide further insights into the dismantling problem
concluding that it is an intrinsically collective problem and that optimal
dismantling sets cannot be viewed as a collection of individually well
performing nodes.

processing. Comprehension tests pose questions based on short text passages to
evaluate such understanding. In this work, we investigate machine comprehension

prior work on {\it MCTest} has focused mainly on engineering better features.
We tackle the dataset with a neural approach, harnessing simple neural networks
arranged in a parallel hierarchy. The parallel hierarchy enables our model to
compare the passage, question, and answer from a variety of trainable
perspectives, as opposed to using a manually designed, rigid feature set.
Perspectives range from the word level to sentence fragments to sequences of
sentences; the networks operate only on word-embedding representations of text.
When trained with a methodology designed to help cope with limited training
data, our Parallel-Hierarchical model sets a new state of the art for {\it
MCTest}, outperforming previous feature-engineered approaches slightly and
previous neural approaches by a significant margin (over 15\% absolute).

formulate an optimization problem to maximize the throughput of the secondary

much attention as they outperform other methods in terms of speed and memory
footprint. Moreover, the Fast Fourier Transform is a natural companion of
pixel-based digital images which often serve as input. In its original form,
one of the biggest challenges for the method is the treatment of
(geometrically) non-linear problems, partially due to the need for a uniform
linear reference problem. In a geometrically linear setting, the problem has
recently been treated in a variational form resulting in an unconditionally
stable scheme that combines Newton iterations with an iterative linear solver,
and therefore exhibits robust and quadratic convergence behavior. Through this
approach, well-known key ingredients were recovered in terms of discretization,
numerical quadrature, consistent linearization of the material model, and the
iterative solution of the resulting linear system. As a result, the extension
to finite strains, using arbitrary constitutive models, is at hand. Because of
the application of the Fast Fourier Transform, the implementation is
substantially easier than that of other (Finite Element) methods. Both claims
are demonstrated in this paper and substantiated with a simple code in Python
of just 59 lines (without comments). The aim is to render the method
transparent and accessible, whereby researchers that are new to this method
should be able to implement it efficiently. The potential of this method is
demonstrated using two examples, each with a different material model.

also be driven by the same mechanism. Close to optimal doping, where the
superconducting transition temperature $T_c$ is maximum in the cuprates, two
different phases are known to compete with superconductivity: a poorly
understood pseudogap phase and a charge ordered phase. Recent experiments have
shown a strong increase in quasiparticle mass $m^*$ in the cuprate
YBa$_2$Cu$_3$O$_{7-\delta}$ as optimal doping is approached suggesting that
quantum fluctuations of the charge ordered phase may be responsible for the
high-$T_c$ superconductivity. We have tested the robustness of this correlation
between $m^*$ and $T_c$ by performing quantum oscillation studies on the

have to be considered. In the first one heat flow between the two systems is
small. In this regime thermally driven occupation fluctuations of the hot QD
modify the transport properties of the conductor system. This leads to an
effect called thermal gating. Experiment have shown how this can be used to
control charge flow in the conductor by means of temperature in a remote

We use a suite of five zoom-in, dark-matter-only simulations, two with
velocity-independent SIDM cross sections, two with velocity-dependent SIDM
cross sections, and one cold dark matter simulation for comparison. After
carefully assigning stellar mass to satellites at infall, we find that stars
are stripped at a higher rate in SIDM than in CDM. In contrast, the total bound
dark matter mass loss rate is minimally affected, with subhalo evaporation
having negligible effects on satellites for viable SIDM models. Centrally
located stars in SIDM haloes disperse out to larger radii as cores grow.
Consequently, the half-light radius of satellites increases, stars become more
vulnerable to tidal stripping, and the stellar mass function is suppressed. We
find that the ratio of core radius to tidal radius accurately predicts the
relative strength of enhanced SIDM stellar stripping. Velocity-independent SIDM
models show a modest increase in the stellar stripping effect with satellite
mass, whereas velocity-dependent SIDM models show a large increase in this
effect towards lower masses, making observations of ultra-faint dwarfs prime
targets for distinguishing between and constraining SIDM models. Due to small
cores in the largest satellites of velocity-dependent SIDM, no identifiable
imprint is left on the all-sky properties of the stellar halo. While our
results focus on SIDM, the main physical mechanism of enhanced tidal stripping
of stars apply similarly to satellites with cores formed via other means.

is tightly correlated with the ratio of the double peak separation (DP) to the
full-width-half maximum (FWHM) of the Halpha emission line, log q = -6.88 -23.2
log (DP/FWHM). The correlation is explained through the efficient truncation of
the outer disc radius by the 3:1 resonance with the companion star. This is the
dominant tidal interaction for extreme mass ratios q=M2/M1<~0.25, the realm of
BH (and some neutron star) X-ray transients. Mass ratios can thus be estimated
with a typical uncertainty of ~32%, provided that the Halpha profile used to
measure DP/FWHM is an orbital phase average. We apply the DP/FWHM-q relation to
the three faint BH transients XTE J1650-500, XTE J1859+226 and Swift J1357-0933

correlation presented in Paper I (casares 2015) allows the extraction of
fundamental parameters from very faint targets and, therefore, the extension of
dynamical BH studies to much deeper limits than was previously possible. As an
example, we combine our mass ratio determination for Swift J1357-0933 with
previous results to yield a BH mass of 12.4+-3.6 Msun. This confirms Swift

carbon flames with 3D hydrodynamic simulations of the Boussinesq equations
using the pseudospectral code Dedalus. Because the flame propagation timescale
is much longer than the convection timescale, we approximate the flame as fixed
in space, and only consider its effects on the buoyancy of the fluid. By
evolving a passive scalar field, we derive a {\it turbulent} chemical
diffusivity produced by the convection as a function of height, $D_{\rm t}(z)$.
Convection can stall a flame if the chemical mixing timescale, set by the
turbulent chemical diffusivity, $D_{\rm t}$, is shorter than the flame
propagation timescale, set by the thermal diffusivity, $\kappa$, i.e., when
$D_{\rm t}>\kappa$. However, we find $D_{\rm t}<\kappa$ for most of the flame
because convective plumes are not dense enough to penetrate into the flame.
Extrapolating to realistic stellar conditions, this implies that convective
mixing cannot stall a carbon flame and that ""hybrid carbon-oxygen-neon"" white
dwarfs are not a typical product of stellar evolution.

gravitational torques impel the angular momentum vector to precess, that is to
slowly stray around the symmetry axis, and nutate, i.e. swing up and down
periodically in the perpendicular direction. This familiar orbital pole motion
- if detected and measured - can reveal the shape of the underlying
gravitational potential, the quantity only crudely gauged in the Galaxy so far.
Here we demonstrate that the debris poles of stellar tidal streams show a very
similar straying and swinging behavior, and give analytic expressions to link
the amplitude and the frequency of the pole evolution to the flattening of the
dark matter distribution. While these results are derived for near-circular
orbits, we show they are also valid for eccentric orbits. Most importantly, we
explain how the differential orbital plane precession leads to the broadening
of the stream and show that streams on polar orbits ought to scatter faster. We
provide expressions for the stream width evolution as a function of the
axisymmetric potential flattening and the angle from the symmetry plane and
prove that our models are in good agreement with streams produced in N-body
simulations. Interestingly, the same intuition applies to streams whose
progenitors are on short or long-axis loops in a triaxial potential. Finally,
we present a compilation of the Galactic cold stream data, and discuss how the
simple picture developed here, along with stream modelling, can be used to
constrain the symmetry axes and flattening of the Milky Way.

promising path for the formation of supermassive blackholes in the early

formation in a fully cosmological context. We combine a semianalytic model of
early galaxy formation with halo merger trees constructed from dark matter
$N$-body simulations. We locate a total of 68 possible DC sites in a volume of
$20\;h^{-1}\;\mathrm{Mpc}$ on a side. We then perform hydrodynamics simulations
for 42 selected halos to study in detail the evolution of the massive clouds
within them. We find only two successful cases where the gas clouds rapidly
collapse to form stars. In the other cases, gravitational collapse is prevented
by the tidal force exerted by a nearby massive halo, which otherwise should
serve as a radiation source necessary for DC. Ram pressure stripping disturbs
the cloud approaching the source. In many cases, a DC halo and its nearby light
source halo merge before the onset of cloud collapse. Only when the DC halo is
assembled through major mergers, the gas density increases rapidly to trigger
gravitational instability. Based on our cosmological simulations, we conclude
that the event rate of DC is an order of magnitude smaller than reported in
previous studies, although the absolute rate is still poorly constrained. It is

investigate the clustering of matter in the Universe in a complementary way
with respect to lower-order statistics, providing additional information with
respect to the two-point correlation function and allowing us to shed light on
biasing, nonlinear processes, and deviations from Gaussian statistics. In this
paper, we analyse the first data release of the VIMOS Public Extragalactic
Redshift Survey (VIPERS), determining the dependence of the three-point
correlation function on luminosity and stellar mass at $z=[0.5,1.1]$. We
exploit the VIPERS Public Data Release 1, consisting of more than 50,000
galaxies with B-band magnitudes in the range $-21.6\lesssim M_{\rm
B}-5\log(h)\lesssim-19.9$ and stellar masses in the range
$9.8\lesssim\log(M_\star[h^{-2}\,M_\odot])\lesssim 10.7$. We measure both the
connected 3PCF and the reduced 3PCF in redshift space, probing different
configurations and scales, in the range $2.5<r\,$[Mpc/h]$<20$. We find a
significant dependence of the reduced 3PCF on scales and triangle shapes, with
stronger anisotropy at larger scales ($r\sim10$ Mpc/h) and an almost flat trend
at smaller scales, $r\sim2.5$ Mpc/h. Massive and luminous galaxies present a
larger connected 3PCF, while the reduced 3PCF is remarkably insensitive to
magnitude and stellar masses in the range we explored. These trends, already
observed at low redshifts, are confirmed for the first time to be still valid
up to $z=1.1$, providing support to the hierarchical scenario for which massive
and bright systems are expected to be more clustered. The possibility of using
the measured 3PCF to provide independent constraints on the linear galaxy bias
$b$ has also been explored, showing promising results in agreement with other
probes.

two sharp signatures infecting CFT$_2$ correlators at large central charge $c$:
'forbidden singularities' arising from Euclidean-time periodicity due to the
effective Hawking temperature, and late-time exponential decay in the
Lorentzian region. We study an infinite class of examples where forbidden
singularities can be resolved by non-perturbative effects at finite $c$, and we
show that the resolution has certain universal features that also apply in the
general case. Analytically continuing to the Lorentzian regime, we find that
the non-perturbative effects that resolve forbidden singularities qualitatively
change the behavior of correlators at times $t \sim S_{BH}$, the black hole
entropy. This may resolve the exponential decay of correlators at late times in
black hole backgrounds. By Borel resumming the $1/c$ expansion of exact
examples, we explicitly identify 'information-restoring' effects from heavy
states that should correspond to classical solutions in AdS$_3$. Our results
suggest a line of inquiry towards a more precise formulation of the
gravitational path integral in AdS$_3$.

presence, or deliberately broadcast it, through controlled laser emission. Such
emission could distort the apparent shape of their transit light curves with
relatively little energy, due to the collimated beam and relatively infrequent
nature of transits. We estimate that humanity could cloak the Earth from
Kepler-like broadband surveys using an optical monochromatic laser array
emitting a peak power of about 30 MW for roughly 10 hours per year. A chromatic
cloak, effective at all wavelengths, is more challenging requiring a large
array of tunable lasers with a total power of approximately 250 MW.
Alternatively, a civilization could cloak only the atmospheric signatures
associated with biological activity on their world, such as oxygen, which is
achievable with a peak laser power of just around 160 kW per transit. Finally,
we suggest that the time of transit for optical SETI is analogous to the
water-hole in radio SETI, providing a clear window in which observers may
expect to communicate. Accordingly, we propose that a civilization may
deliberately broadcast their technological capabilities by distorting their
transit to an artificial shape, which serves as both a SETI beacon and a medium
for data transmission. Such signatures could be readily searched in the
archival data of transit surveys.

decreases because of the formation of complex organic molecules (COM),

consequences of both instabilities in models of Wolf-Rayet stars. We determine
the convective velocities in the sub-surface convective zones to estimate the
amplitude of the turbulent velocity at the base of the wind that potentially
leads to the formation of small-scale wind structures, as observed in several
WR stars. We also investigate the effect of mass loss on the pulsations of our
models. We approximated solar metallicity WR stars by models of mass-losing
helium stars, and we characterized the properties of convection in the envelope
adopting the standard MLT. Our results show the occurrence of sub-surface
convective regions in all studied models. Small surface velocity amplitudes are
predicted for models with masses below 10Msun. For models with M>10Msun, the
surface velocity amplitudes are of the order of 10km/s. Moreover we find the
occurrence of pulsations for stars in the mass range 9-14Msun, while mass loss
appears to stabilize the more massive WR stars. We confront our results with
observationally derived line variabilities of 17 WN stars. The data suggest
variability to occur for stars above 10Msun, which is increasing linearly with
mass above this value, in agreement with our results. We further find some of
our models to be unstable to radial pulsations, and predict local magnetic
fields of the order of hundreds of Gauss in WR stars more massive than 10Msun.
Our study relates the surface velocity fluctuations induced by sub-surface
convection to the formation of clumping in the inner part of the wind. From
this mechanism, we expect a stronger variability in more massive WR stars.

to identify post-starbursts in high-redshift surveys. The method classifies the
broad-band optical-near--infrared spectral energy distributions (SEDs) of
galaxies using three spectral shape parameters (super-colours), derived from a
principal component analysis of model SEDs. When applied to the multiwavelength
photometric data in the UKIDSS Ultra Deep Survey (UDS), this technique
identified over 900 candidate post-starbursts at redshifts $0.5<z<2.0$. In this
study we present deep optical spectroscopy for a subset of these galaxies, in
order to confirm their post-starburst nature. Where a spectroscopic assessment
was possible, we find the majority (19/24 galaxies; ~80 per cent) exhibit the
strong Balmer absorption (H $\delta$ equivalent width $W_{\lambda}$ >5 Ang.)
and Balmer break, characteristic of post-starburst galaxies. We conclude that
photometric methods can be used to select large samples of recently-quenched
galaxies in the distant Universe.

exoplanetary atmospheres. During a transit, the light blocked from the
atmosphere of the planet leaves an imprint in the light coming from the star.
This has been shown for many exoplanets with different techniques, with both
photometry and spectroscopy. We aim at testing chromatic line-profile
tomography as a new tool to investigate exoplanetary atmospheres. The signal
imprinted on the cross-correlation function (CCF) by a planet transiting its
star is dependent on the planet-to-star radius ratio. We want to verify if the
precision reachable on the CCF obtained from a subset of the spectral orders of
the HARPS spectrograph is enough to discriminate the radius of a planet at
different wavelengths. Methods. We analyze HARPS archival data of three
transits of HD 189733b. We divide the HARPS spectral range in 7 broadbands,
calculating for each band the ratio between the area of the out-of-transit CCF
and the area of the signal imprinted by the planet on it during the full part
of the transit. We take into account the effect of the limb darkening using the
theoretical coefficients of a linear law. Averaging the results of three
different transits allows us to obtain a good quality broadband transmission
spectrum of HD 189733b, with a precision greater than that of the chromatic RM
effect. Results. We proved chromatic line-profile tomography to be an
interesting way to reveal broadband transmission spectra of exoplanets: our
analysis of the atmosphere of HD 189733b is in agreement with other ground- and
space-based observations. The independent analysis of different transits puts
in evidence the probability that stellar activity plays a role in the extracted
transmission spectrum. Care has thus to be taken when claiming for Rayleigh
scattering in the atmosphere of exoplanets orbiting active stars using only one
transit.

investigate effects of disorder, iron concentration, and temperature on this

concentration and disorder are addressed using complete statistical samplings
of coupled substituted configurations in super-cells containing up to 80 atoms.
Vibrational/thermal effects on the crossover are addressed within the
quasiharmonic approximation. The effect of disorder seems quite small, while
increasing iron concentration results in considerable increase in crossover
pressure. Our calculated compression curves for iron-free, Fe$^{2+}$-, and
Fe$^{3+}$-bearing bridgmanite compare well with the latest experimental
measurements. The comparison also suggests that in a close system, Fe$^{2+}$
present in the sample may transform into Fe$^{3+}$ by introduction of Mg and O
vacancies with increasing pressure. As in the spin crossover in ferropericlase,
this crossover in bridgmanite is accompanied by a clear volume reduction and an
anomalous softening of the bulk modulus throughout the crossover pressure
range. These effects reduce significantly with increasing temperature. Though
the concentration of [Fe$^{3+}$]$_{Si}$ in bridgmanite may be small, related
elastic anomalies may impact the interpretation of radial and lateral velocity

elliptically polarized. During light-matter interaction, transfer of linear
momentum leads to optical forces, while angular momentum transfer induces
optical torque. Optical forces including radiation pressure and gradient forces
have long been utilized in optical tweezers and laser cooling. In nanophotonic
devices optical forces can be significantly enhanced, leading to unprecedented
optomechanical effects in both classical and quantum regimes. In contrast, to
date, the angular momentum of light and the optical torque effect remain
unexplored in integrated photonics. Here, we demonstrate the measurement of the
spin angular momentum of photons propagating in a birefringent waveguide and
the use of optical torque to actuate rotational motion of an optomechanical
device. We show that the sign and magnitude of the optical torque are
determined by the photon polarization states that are synthesized on the chip.
Our study reveals the mechanical effect of photon's polarization degree of
freedom and demonstrates its control in integrated photonic devices. Exploiting
optical torque and optomechanical interaction with photon angular momentum can
lead to torsional cavity optomechanics and optomechanical photon spin-orbit
coupling, as well as applications such as optomechanical gyroscope and

by performing a quantitative comparison against available solution NMR data of

provide the first opportunity to learn about physics in the extreme gravity
environment of coalescing binary black holes. The LIGO Scientific Collaboration
and the Virgo Collaboration have verified that this observation is consistent
with General Relativity. This paper expands their analysis to a larger class of
anomalies, highlighting the inferences that can be drawn on non-standard
theoretical physics mechanisms. We find that these events constrain a plethora
of mechanisms associated with the generation and propagation of gravitational
waves, including the activation of scalar fields, gravitational leakage into
large extra dimensions, the variability of Newton's constant, a modified
dispersion relation, gravitational Lorentz violation and the strong equivalence
principle. Though other observations limit many of these mechanisms already,
GW150914 and GW151226 are unique in that they are direct probes of dynamical
strong-field gravity and of gravitational wave propagation. We also show that
GW150914 constrains inferred properties of exotic compact object alternatives
to Kerr black holes. We argue, however, that the true potential for GW150914 to
both rule out exotic objects and constrain physics beyond General Relativity is
severely limited by the lack of understanding of the merger regime in almost
all relevant modified gravity theories. This event thus significantly raises
the bar that these theories have to pass, both in terms of having a sound
theoretical underpinning, and being able to solve the equations of motion for
binary merger events. We conclude with a discussion of the additional
inferences that can be drawn if the lower-confidence observation of an
electromagnetic counterpart to GW150914 holds true; this would provide dramatic
constraints on the speed of gravity and gravitational Lorentz violation.

degrading the data with systematics. This paper and its companions show that
dishes are viable for achieving this balance using the Hydrogen Epoch of

spectral systematics associated with the antenna power pattern as a significant
detriment to all EoR experiments which causes the already bright foreground
power to leak well beyond ideal limits and contaminate the otherwise clean EoR
signal modes. A primary source of this chromaticity is reflections in the
antenna-feed assembly and between structures in neighboring antennas. Using
precise foreground simulations taking wide-field effects into account, we
provide a framework to set cosmologically-motivated design specifications on
these reflections to prevent further EoR signal degradation. We show HERA will
not be impeded by such spectral systematics and demonstrate that even in a
conservative scenario that does not perform removal of foregrounds, HERA will
detect EoR signal in line-of-sight $k$-modes, $k_\parallel \gtrsim

Although RSP has been demonstrated in recent years to remotely prepare

required, i.e., to prepare N-photon states via RSP, quantum measurement on the
other N-photons was required, hence significantly limiting practicality and
applicability of RSP. Here we report the first experimental demonstration of
remote preparation of three-photon entangled states by measuring only a
single-photon entangled with the three photons. We further generalize our
protocol to prepare multi-photon entangled states with arbitrary photon number
and purity via single-photon measurement. As our RSP scheme relies on the
nonlinearity induced by single-photon measurement, it enables quantum state
engineering of multi-photon entangled states beyond the linear optical limit.
Our results are expected to have significant impacts on quantum metrology and
quantum information processing.

specifically, by using the spherically invariant random process (SIRP) model.
In this paper, we focus on the estimation and performance analysis of the
angular spacing between two targets for the MIMO radar under the SIRP clutter.
First, we propose an iterative maximum likelihood as well as an iterative
maximum a posteriori estimator, for the target's spacing parameter estimation
in the SIRP clutter context. Then we derive and compare various
Cram\'er-Rao-like bounds (CRLBs) for performance assessment. Finally, we
address the problem of target resolvability by using the concept of angular
resolution limit (ARL), and derive an analytical, closed-form expression of the
ARL based on Smith's criterion, between two closely spaced targets in a MIMO
radar context under SIRP clutter. For this aim we also obtain the non-matrix,
closed-form expressions for each of the CRLBs. Finally, we provide numerical
simulations to assess the performance of the proposed algorithms, the validity
of the derived ARL expression, and to reveal the ARL's insightful properties.

main technical difficulty is that our models exhibit configurations that do not
evolve under the dynamics - the blocked configurations - and are locally
non-ergodic. Our proof does not impose any knowledge on the spectral gap for
the microscopic models. Instead, it relies on the fact that, under the
equilibrium measure, the probability to find a blocked configuration in a
finite box is exponentially small in the size of the box. Then, a dynamical
mechanism allows to exchange particles even when the jump rate for the direct
exchange is zero.

every branch of science is undoubtedly $k$-means: given a set of data points
and a parameter $k$, select $k$ centres and partition the data points into $k$
clusters around these centres so that the sum of squares of distances of the
points to their cluster centre is minimized. Typically these data points lie
$\mathbb{R}^d$ for some $d\geq 2$.
  $k$-means and the first algorithms for it were introduced in the 1950's.
Since then, hundreds of papers have studied this problem and many algorithms
have been proposed for it. The most commonly used algorithm is known as
Lloyd-Forgy, which is also referred to as ""the"" $k$-means algorithm, and
various extensions of it often work very well in practice. However, they may
produce solutions whose cost is arbitrarily large compared to the optimum
solution. Kanungo et al. [2004] analyzed a simple local search heuristic to get
a polynomial-time algorithm with approximation ratio $9+\epsilon$ for any fixed
$\epsilon>0$ for $k$-means in Euclidean space.
  Finding an algorithm with a better approximation guarantee has remained one
of the biggest open questions in this area, in particular whether one can get a
true PTAS for fixed dimension Euclidean space. We settle this problem by
showing that a simple local search algorithm provides a PTAS for $k$-means in
$\mathbb{R}^d$ for any fixed $d$. More precisely, for any error parameter
$\epsilon>0$, the local search algorithm that considers swaps of up to
$\rho=d^{O(d)}\cdot{\epsilon}^{-O(d/\epsilon)}$ centres at a time finds a
solution using exactly $k$ centres whose cost is at most a
$(1+\epsilon)$-factor greater than the optimum.
  Finally, we provide the first demonstration that local search yields a PTAS
for the uncapacitated facility location problem and $k$-median with non-uniform
opening costs in doubling metrics.

for finite lifetime and randomly occurring transients, and found that
quasi-periodic processes, with period longer than the time scale of the
transients, are detectable intrinsically in form of trains. We simulate their
propagation in an empirical solar atmospheric model with chromosphere,
transition region and corona. We found that, due to the filtering effect of the
chromospheric cavity, only the resonance period of the acoustic resonator is
able to propagate to the upper atmosphere, such a scenario is applicable to
slow magnetoacoustic waves in sunspots and active regions. If the thermal
structure of the atmosphere is less wild and acoustic resonance does not take
effect, the long period oscillations could propagate to the upper atmosphere.
Such case would be more likely to occur at polar plumes.

and excitement. Authoring even two body collisions in the real world can be
difficult, as one has to get timing and the object trajectories to be correctly
synchronized. After tedious trial-and-error iterations, when objects can
actually be made to collide, then they are difficult to capture in 3D. In
contrast, synthetically generating plausible collisions is difficult as it
requires adjusting different collision parameters (e.g., object mass ratio,
coefficient of restitution, etc.) and appropriate initial parameters. We
present SMASH to directly read off appropriate collision parameters directly
from raw input video recordings. Technically we enable this by utilizing laws
of rigid body collision to regularize the problem of lifting 2D trajectories to
a physically valid 3D reconstruction of the collision. The reconstructed
sequences can then be modified and combined to easily author novel and
plausible collisions. We evaluate our system on a range of synthetic scenes and
demonstrate the effectiveness of our method by accurately reconstructing
several complex real world collision events.

novae often exhibit multiple shock waves that overlap one another. When the
intersection angle between two shock waves exceeds a critical value, the system
reconfigures its geometry to create a normal shock known as a Mach stem where
the shocks meet. Mach stems are important for interpreting emission-line images
of shocked gas because a normal shock produces higher postshock temperatures
and therefore a higher-excitation spectrum than an oblique one does. In this
paper we summarize the results of a series of numerical simulations and
laboratory experiments designed to quantify how Mach stems behave in supersonic
plasmas that are the norm in astrophysical flows. The experiments test
analytical predictions for critical angles where Mach stems should form, and
quantify how Mach stems grow and decay as intersection angles between the
incident shock and a surface change. While small Mach stems are destroyed by
surface irregularities and subcritical angles, larger ones persist in these
situations, and can regrow if the intersection angle changes to become more
favorable. The experimental and numerical results show that although Mach stems
occur only over a limited range of intersection angles and size scales, within
these ranges they are relatively robust, and hence are a viable explanation for
variable bright knots observed in HST images at the intersections of some bow
shocks in stellar jets.

  Interference Alignment","6 pages, 4 figures",,,,"cs.IT math.IT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In recent years, several experimental studies have come out to validate the
theoretical findings of interference alignment (IA), but only a handful of
studies have focused on blind interference alignment. Unlike IA and other
interference mitigation techniques, blind IA does not require channel state
information at the transmitter (CSIT). The key insight is that the transmitter
uses the knowledge of channel coherence intervals and receivers utilize
reconfigurable antennas to create channel fluctuations exploited by the
transmitter. In this work, we present a novel experimental evaluation of a
reconfigurable antenna system for achieving blind IA. We present a blind IA
technique based on reconfigurable antennas for a 2-user multipleinput
single-output (MISO) broadcast channel implemented on a software defined radio
platform where each of the receivers is equipped with a reconfigurable antenna.
We further compare this blind IA implementation with traditional TDMA scheme
for benchmarking purposes. We show that the achievable rates for blind IA can
be realized in practice using measured channels under practical channel
conditions. Additionally, the average error vector magnitude and bit error rate
(BER) performances are evaluated.

networks. Although modern probabilistic inference toolkits make it relatively
easy to specify large and practically relevant probabilistic models, the silver
bullet---an efficient and general online inference algorithm for such
problems---remains elusive, forcing users to write special-purpose code for
each application. We propose a novel blackbox algorithm -- a hybrid of particle
filtering for state variables and assumed density filtering for parameter
variables. It has following advantages: (a) it is efficient due to its online
nature, and (b) it is applicable to both discrete and continuous parameter
spaces . On a variety of toy and real models, our system is able to generate
more accurate results within a fixed computation budget. This preliminary
evidence indicates that the proposed approach is likely to be of practical use.

optimal control problem involving the fractional Laplacian. For such a control
problem, we derived optimal a priori error estimates that demand the convexity
of the domain and some compatibility conditions on the data. To relax such
restrictions, in this paper, we introduce and analyze an efficient and, under
certain assumptions, reliable a posteriori error estimator. We realize the
fractional Laplacian as the Dirichlet-to-Neumann map for a nonuniformly
elliptic problem posed on a semi--infinite cylinder in one more spatial
dimension. This extra dimension further motivates the design of an posteriori
error indicator. The latter is defined as the sum of three contributions, which
come from the discretization of the state and adjoint equations and the control
variable. The indicator for the state and adjoint equations relies on an
anisotropic error estimator in Muckenhoupt weighted Sobolev spaces. The
analysis is valid in any dimension. On the basis of the devised a posteriori
error estimator, we design a simple adaptive strategy that exhibits optimal
experimental rates of convergence.

shoulder (often referred to as ""bump"") at neutrino energies 5-7 MeV, not

binary evolution, notably evolved blue stragglers. We took new measurements of
the radial velocities in a sample of 26 stars from APOKASC, including 13
""young"" stars and 13 ""old"" stars with similar stellar parameters but with
masses below 1.2 M_sun and found that more of the ""young"" stars appear to be in
binary systems with respect to the ""old"" stars. Furthermore, we show that the
""young"" stars do not follow the expected trend of [C/H] ratios versus mass for
individual stars. However, with a population synthesis of low-mass stars
including binary evolution and mass transfer, we can reproduce the observed
[C/N] ratios versus mass. Our study shows how asteroseismology of solar-type
red giants provides us with a unique opportunity to study the evolution of
field blue stragglers after they have left the main-sequence.

spacetimes (with emphasis on asymptotically anti-de Sitter black holes) that
may be used for numerics when completely-analytic results are unattainable. The
method utilizes the expression for one-loop determinants in terms of
quasinormal frequencies determined by Denef, Hartnoll and Sachdev in
\cite{Denef:2009kn}. A numerical evaluation must face the fact that the sum
over the quasinormal modes, indexed by momentum and overtone numbers, is
divergent. A necessary ingredient is then a regularization scheme to handle the
divergent contributions of individual fixed-momentum sectors to the partition
function. To this end, we formulate an effective two-dimensional problem in
which a natural refinement of standard heat kernel techniques can be used to
account for contributions to the partition function at fixed momentum. We test
our method in a concrete case by reproducing the scalar one-loop determinant in
the BTZ black hole background. We then discuss the application of such
techniques to more complicated spacetimes.

$\mathcal{H}(n) = (H_1,\dotsc, H_n)$, Benjamini and Hochberg introduced the
false discovery rate (FDR), which is the expected proportion of false positives
among rejected null hypotheses, and proposed a testing procedure that controls
FDR below a pre-assigned significance level. Nowadays FDR is the criterion of
choice for large scale multiple hypothesis testing. In this paper we consider
the problem of controlling FDR in an ""online manner"". Concretely, we consider
an ordered --possibly infinite-- sequence of null hypotheses $\mathcal{H} =
(H_1,H_2,H_3,\dots )$ where, at each step $i$, the statistician must decide
whether to reject hypothesis $H_i$ having access only to the previous
decisions. This model was introduced by Foster and Stine. We study a class of
""generalized alpha-investing"" procedures and prove that any rule in this class
controls online FDR, provided $p$-values corresponding to true nulls are
independent from the other $p$-values. (Earlier work only established mFDR
control.) Next, we obtain conditions under which generalized alpha-investing
controls FDR in the presence of general $p$-values dependencies. Finally, we
develop a modified set of procedures that also allow to control the false
discovery exceedance (the tail of the proportion of false discoveries).

the this algorithm to the recent sequential Monte Carlo square (SMC$^2$)

parameter support and the stability and continuity of the sequence of posterior
distributions for the state--space model, we prove that the $L_p$ norms of the
approximation errors vanish asymptotically (as the number of Monte Carlo
samples generated by the algorithm increases) and uniformly over time. We also
prove that, under the same assumptions, the proposed scheme can asymptotically
identify the parameter values for a class of models. We conclude the paper with

graph is $\alpha$-balanced if for every cut $S \subseteq V$, the total weight
of edges going from $S$ to $V\setminus S$ is within factor $\alpha$ of the
total weight of edges going from $V\setminus S$ to $S$. Several important
families of graphs are nearly balanced, in particular, Eulerian graphs (with
$\alpha = 1$) and residual graphs of $(1+\epsilon)$-approximate undirected
maximum flows (with $\alpha=O(1/\epsilon)$).
  We use the notion of balance to give a more fine-grained understanding of
several well-studied routing questions that are considerably harder in directed
graphs. We first revisit oblivious routings in directed graphs. Our main
algorithmic result is an oblivious routing scheme for single-source instances
that achieve an $O(\alpha \cdot \log^3 n / \log \log n)$ competitive ratio. In
the process, we make several technical contributions which may be of
independent interest. In particular, we give an efficient algorithm for
computing low-radius decompositions of directed graphs parameterized by
balance. We also define and construct low-stretch arborescences, a
generalization of low-stretch spanning trees to directed graphs.
  On the negative side, we present new lower bounds for oblivious routing
problems on directed graphs. We show that the competitive ratio of oblivious
routing algorithms for directed graphs is $\Omega(n)$ in general; this result
improves upon the long-standing best known lower bound of $\Omega(\sqrt{n})$
given by Hajiaghayi, Kleinberg, Leighton and R\""acke in 2006. We also show that
our restriction to single-source instances is necessary by showing an
$\Omega(\sqrt{n})$ lower bound for multiple-source oblivious routing in

into tree formulas for the Green function and hitting probabilities of Markov

loop-erased random walks by Wilson's algorithm for random spanning trees, and
to mixing times by the Markov chain tree theorem. Let $m_{ij}$ be the mean
first passage time from $i$ to $j$ for an irreducible chain with finite state
space $S$ and transition matrix $(p_{ij}; i, j \in S)$. It is well-known that
$m_{jj} = 1/\pi_j = \Sigma^{(1)}/\Sigma_j$, where $\pi$ is the stationary
distribution for the chain, $\Sigma_j$ is the tree sum, over $n^{n-2}$ trees
$\textbf{t}$ spanning $S$ with root $j$ and edges $i \rightarrow k$ directed to
$j$, of the tree product $\prod_{i \rightarrow k \in \textbf{t} }p_{ik}$, and
$\Sigma^{(1)}:= \sum_{j \in S} \Sigma_j$. Chebotarev and Agaev derived further
results from {\em Kirchhoff's matrix tree theorem}. We deduce that for $i \ne
j$, $m_{ij} = \Sigma_{ij}/\Sigma_j$, where $\Sigma_{ij}$ is the sum over the
same set of $n^{n-2}$ spanning trees of the same tree product as for
$\Sigma_j$, except that in each product the factor $p_{kj}$ is omitted where $k
= k(i,j,\textbf{t})$ is the last state before $j$ in the path from $i$ to $j$
in $\textbf{t}$. It follows that Kemeny's constant $\sum_{j \in S}
m_{ij}/m_{jj}$ equals to $ \Sigma^{(2)}/\Sigma^{(1)}$, where $\Sigma^{(r)}$ is
the sum, over all forests $\textbf{f}$ labeled by $S$ with $r$ trees, of the
product of $p_{ij}$ over edges $i \rightarrow j$ of $\textbf{t}$. We show that
these results can be derived without appeal to the matrix tree theorem. A list

bubble placed on the inner wall of a spherical cavity are studied. The contact
angle between the lens-shaped droplet and the concave spherical substrate is
expressed by the generalized Young's formula. The equator of the spherical
substrate is found to play a crucial role. Neither a droplet with its contact
line on the upper hemisphere of the substrate nor one with its contact line on
the lower hemisphere can transform into each other continuously. On a
hydrophobic substrate, the contact angle jumps discontinuously to
$180^{\circ}$, and the droplet is detached from the substrate to form a
spherical droplet when the line tension is positive and large. This is similar
to the drying transition on a flat substrate. On the other hand, on a
hydrophilic substrate, the contact angle jumps discontinuously to $0^{\circ}$
when the line tension is positive and large. Then, the droplet spread over the
whole inner wall to leave a spherical bubble. Therefore, not only the drying
transition but also the wetting transition is induced by positive line tension
on a concave spherical substrate. There also exist stable as well as metastable
droplets, whose phase diagrams can be complex. When the line tension is
negative and its magnitude increases, the contact line approaches the equator
infinitesimally from either above or below. However, it cannot cross the
equator of a spherical cavity continuously. The droplet with a contact line
that coincides with the equator is a singular droplet. The contact line is
pinned and cannot move, irrespective of the magnitude of the line tension.

nanomaterials and biological membranes, remains limited. In this work,
dodecanethiol-capped gold nanoparticles (Au-NPs) with an average core diameter
of 6 nm were incorporated into 1,2-dipalmitoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine
(DPPC) monolayers in area ratios ranging from 0.1 to 20% area coverage at a
surface pressure of 30 mN/m. High resolution liquid surface X-ray scattering
studies revealed a phase separation of the DPPC and Au-NP components of the
composite film, as confirmed with atomic force microscopy after the film was
transferred to a substrate. At low Au-NP content, the structural organization
of the phase-separated film is best described as a DPPC film containing
isolated islands of Au-NPs. However, increasing the Au-NP content beyond 5%
area coverage transforms the structural organization of the composite film to a
long-range interconnected network of Au-NP strands surrounding small seas of
DPPC, where the density of the Au-NP network increases with increasing Au-NP
content. The observed phase separation and structural organization of the
phospholipid and nanoparticle components in these Langmuir monolayers are
useful for understanding interactions of nanoparticles with biological
membranes.

Many algorithms have been proposed for palmprint recognition in the past,
majority of them being based on features extracted from the transform domain.
Many of these transform domain features are not translation or rotation
invariant, and therefore a great deal of preprocessing is needed to align the
images. In this paper, a powerful image representation, called scattering
network/transform, is used for palmprint recognition. Scattering network is a
convolutional network where its architecture and filters are predefined wavelet
transforms. The first layer of scattering network captures similar features to
SIFT descriptors and the higher-layer features capture higher-frequency content
of the signal which are lost in SIFT and other similar descriptors. After
extraction of the scattering features, their dimensionality is reduced by
applying principal component analysis (PCA) which reduces the computational
complexity of the recognition task. Two different classifiers are used for
recognition: multi-class SVM and minimum-distance classifier. The proposed
scheme has been tested on a well-known palmprint database and achieved accuracy
rate of 99.95% and 100% using minimum distance classifier and SVM respectively.

patterns of the transition probabilities $P(\nu_\mu \rightarrow \nu_\tau)$ and
$P(\bar{\nu}_\mu \rightarrow \bar{\nu}_\tau)$ are sensitive to these
oscillation parameters. An asymmetry parameter can be defined as the difference
of these two probabilities normalized to their sum. The profile of the
asymmetry parameter gives a clear signal of the mass ordering as it is found to
be positive for inverted hierarchy and negative for normal hierarchy. The
asymmetry parameter is also sensitive to the CP phase. We consider the effects
of non-standard neutrino interactions (NSI) on the determination of the mass
hierarchy. Since we assume the largest new physics effects involve the $\tau$
sector only, we ignore NSI in production and study the NSI effects in detection
as well as along propagation. We find that the NSI effects can significantly
modify the prediction of the asymmetry parameter though the MH can still be

is very difficult in the worst cases, but for random graphs this problem can be
efficiently solved after converting it into an appropriate spin glass model
[H.-J. Zhou, Eur. Phys. J. B 86 (2013) 455]. In the present work we study the
local stability and the phase transition properties of this spin glass model on
random graphs. For both regular random graphs and Erd\""os-R\'enyi graphs we
determine the inverse temperature $\beta_l$ at which the replica-symmetric mean
field theory loses its local stability, the inverse temperature $\beta_d$ of
the dynamical (clustering) phase transition, and the inverse temperature
$\beta_c$ of the static (condensation) phase transition. We find that
$\beta_{l}$, $\beta_{d}$, and $\beta_c$ change with the (mean) vertex degree in
a non-monotonic way; $\beta_d$ is distinct from $\beta_c$ for regular random
graphs of vertex degrees $K\geq 64$, while $\beta_d$ are always identical to
$\beta_c$ for Erd\""os-R\'enyi graphs (at least up to mean vertex degree
$c=512$). We also compute the minimum FVS size of regular random graphs through
the zero-temperature first-step replica-symmetry-breaking mean field theory and
reach good agreement with the results obtained on single graph instances by the
belief propagation-guided decimation algorithm. Taking together, this paper
presents a systematic theoretical study on the energy landscape property of a

paramagnetic side of the transition. In the present work, we explore the
occurrence of QGP in nanoparticles of this alloy system. Nanoalloys with $x$ in
the neighbourhood of $x_c$ and mean diameter 18-33 nm were prepared by a
chemical reflux method. Following a few microscopic and spectroscopic studies
to determine the sizes, compositions and phases, dc magnetization measurements
were also performed to seek out any signature of QGP in the nanoalloys. A
paramagnetic-like increase of magnetization is observed to emerge below an
$x$-dependent transition temperature $\rm{T_P} (\it{x})$ within the blocked
ferromagnetic state of the nanoparticles, and is corroborated by a peak at
$\rm{T_P} (\it{x})$ in the temperature dependence of resistivity. The magnetic
susceptibility in this emergent phase follows a non-Curie power-law temperature
dependence below 10 K for $0.09 \leq x \leq 0.14$, indicating the presence of a
QGP in the nanoparticles within these temperature and composition ranges.

build data centers all around the world. The resulting data is ""born""
geographically distributed. On the other hand, many machine learning
applications require a global view of such data in order to achieve the best
results. These types of applications form a new class of learning problems,
which we call Geo-Distributed Machine Learning (GDML). Such applications need
to cope with: 1) scarce and expensive cross-data center bandwidth, and 2)
growing privacy concerns that are pushing for stricter data sovereignty
regulations. Current solutions to learning from geo-distributed data sources
revolve around the idea of first centralizing the data in one data center, and
then training locally. As machine learning algorithms are
communication-intensive, the cost of centralizing the data is thought to be
offset by the lower cost of intra-data center communication during training. In
this work, we show that the current centralized practice can be far from
optimal, and propose a system for doing geo-distributed training. Furthermore,
we argue that the geo-distributed approach is structurally more amenable to
dealing with regulatory constraints, as raw data never leaves the source data
center. Our empirical evaluation on three real datasets confirms the general
validity of our approach, and shows that GDML is not only possible but also
advisable in many scenarios.

non-equilibrium thermodynamics. Of specific interest is the application of a
fluctuation relation that subsumes the second law of thermodynamics en route to
deriving the evolution equations for the internal state variables. The modeling
itself is accomplished in a two-temperature framework that appears naturally by
considering the thermodynamic system to be composed of two weakly interacting
subsystems, viz. a kinetic vibrational subsystem corresponding to the atomic
lattice vibrations and a configurational subsystem of the slower degrees of
freedom describing the motion of defects in a plastically deforming metal. When
externally driven, the two subsystems, identified with their own temperatures,
fall out of equilibrium. An apparently physical nature of the present model
derives upon considering the dislocation density, which characterizes the
configurational subsystem, as a state variable. The continuum model
accommodates finite deformation and describes plastic deformation in a
yield-free setup via the so-called microscopic force balance along with the
more conventional macroscopic force balance. Though the theory here is
essentially limited to face-centered cubic metals modelled with a single
dislocation density as the internal variable, an extension to body-centered
cubic metals and modelling with two internal variables with dislocation
densities of two non-overlapping types are briefly touched upon.

Optimal algorithms for the detection exist which are based on spectral methods,

Different real-world applications evaluate performance by different cost

cost functions. In this paper, we resolve the performance issue by proposing a
novel cost-sensitive LE algorithm that takes the cost function of interest into

multidimensional scaling (CLEMS), approximates the cost information with the
distances of the embedded vectors by using the classic multidimensional scaling
approach for manifold learning. CLEMS is able to deal with both symmetric and
asymmetric cost functions, and effectively makes cost-sensitive decisions by
nearest-neighbor decoding within the embedded vectors. We derive theoretical
results that justify how CLEMS achieves the desired cost-sensitivity.
Furthermore, extensive experimental results demonstrate that CLEMS is
significantly better than a wide spectrum of existing LE algorithms and

The benefit is that $N$ streams can be multiplexed per user, at the price of
increasing the channel estimation overhead linearly with $N$. Uplink and
downlink spectral efficiency (SE) expressions are derived for any $N$, and
these are achievable using estimated channels and per-user-basis MMSE-SIC
detectors. Large-system approximations of the SEs are obtained. This analysis
shows that MMSE-SIC has similar asymptotic SE as linear MMSE detectors,
indicating that the SE increase from having multi-antenna users can be
harvested using linear detectors. We generalize the power scaling laws for
massive MIMO to handle arbitrary $N$, and show that one can reduce the
multiplication of the pilot power and payload power as $\frac{1}{M}$ where $M$
is the number of BS antennas, and still notably increase the SE with $M$ before
reaching a non-zero asymptotic limit. Simulations testify our analysis and show
that the SE increases with $N$. We also note that the same improvement can be
achieved by serving $N$ times more single-antenna users instead, thus the
additional user antennas are particular beneficial for SE enhancement when
there are few active users in the system.

  version is available at http://arxiv.org/abs/1606.08921",,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In this paper, we propose a very deep fully convolutional encoding-decoding
framework for image restoration such as denoising and super-resolution. The
network is composed of multiple layers of convolution and de-convolution
operators, learning end-to-end mappings from corrupted images to the original
ones. The convolutional layers act as the feature extractor, which capture the
abstraction of image contents while eliminating noises/corruptions.
De-convolutional layers are then used to recover the image details. We propose
to symmetrically link convolutional and de-convolutional layers with skip-layer
connections, with which the training converges much faster and attains a
higher-quality local optimum. First, The skip connections allow the signal to
be back-propagated to bottom layers directly, and thus tackles the problem of
gradient vanishing, making training deep networks easier and achieving
restoration performance gains consequently. Second, these skip connections pass
image details from convolutional layers to de-convolutional layers, which is
beneficial in recovering the original image. Significantly, with the large
capacity, we can handle different levels of noises using a single model.
Experimental results show that our network achieves better performance than all
previously reported state-of-the-art methods.

ruling out a nesting mechanism as the driving force for the modulation. The CDW
stabilizes levels lying around 1.5 eV below the Fermi level within the Se-based

interlayer interactions leads to the suppression of the pancake-like portion of
the bulk Fermi surface in the single-layer. We perform scanning tunneling

the electronic reorganization also has an important contribution. The analysis
of the variation of these images with the bias voltage does not support a Fermi
surface nesting mechanism for the CDW. It is also shown that underlying

its feeding between two prey populations. We develop a novel 1 fast--3 slow
dynamical system to describe the dynamics of the three populations amidst
continuous but rapid evolution of the predator's diet choice. The two extremes
at which the predator's diet is composed solely of one prey correspond to two
branches of the three-branch critical manifold of the fast--slow system. By
calculating the points at which there is a fast transition between these two
feeding choices (i.e., branches of the critical manifold), we prove that the
system has a two-parameter family of periodic orbits for sufficiently large
separation of the time scales between the evolutionary and ecological dynamics.
Using numerical simulations, we show that these periodic orbits exist, and that
their phase difference and oscillation patterns persist, when ecological and
evolutionary interactions occur on comparable time scales. Our model also
exhibits periodic orbits that agree qualitatively with oscillation patterns
observed in experimental studies of the coupling between rapid evolution and
ecological interactions.

both jets and plumes. For plumes, this value is a result of the difference in
the ratio of the radial turbulent transport of radial momentum and buoyancy.
For jets however, the value originates from a different spread of the buoyancy

transport terms is approximately unity. The DNS data does not show any evidence

a test case of the COMs synthesis in the ISM, we present new quantum chemical
calculations on the formation of acetaldehyde (CH3CHO) from the coupling of the
HCO and CH3 radicals, both in gas phase and on water ice surfaces. The binding
energies of HCO and CH3 on the amorphous water ice were also computed (2333 and

be either CH3CHO, CH4 + CO, or CH3OCH, depending on the relative orientation of

product is possible due to the geometrical constraints imposed by the water ice
surface. Therefore, acetaldehyde cannot be synthesized by the CH3 + HCO
coupling on the icy grains. We discuss the implications of these results and
other cases, such as ethylene glycol and dimethyl ether, in which similar
situations can occur, suggesting that formation of these molecules on the grain

challenge. We investigate the thermo-hydrodynamic properties of cloud formation
processes in the atmospheres of hot Jupiter exoplanets. We simulate the dynamic
atmosphere of HD 189733b with a 3D model that couples 3D
radiative-hydrodynamics with a kinetic, microphysical mineral cloud formation
module designed for RHD/GCM exoplanet atmosphere simulations. Our simulation
includes the feedback effects of cloud advection and settling, gas phase
element advection and depletion/replenishment and the radiative effects of
cloud opacity. We model the cloud particles as a mix of mineral materials which
change in size and composition as they travel through atmospheric
thermo-chemical environments. All local cloud properties such as number
density, grain size and material composition are time-dependently calculated.
Gas phase element depletion as a result of cloud formation is included in the
model. In-situ \textit{effective medium theory} and Mie theory is applied to
calculate the wavelength dependent opacity of the cloud component. We present a
3D cloud structure of a chemically complex, gaseous atmosphere of the hot
Jupiter HD 189733b. Mean cloud particle sizes are typically sub-micron
(0.01-0.5 $\mu$m) at pressures less than 1 bar with hotter equatorial regions
containing the smallest grains. Denser cloud structures occur near terminator
regions and deeper ($\sim$ 1 bar) atmospheric layers. Silicate materials such
as MgSiO$_{3}$[s] are found to be abundant at mid-high latitudes, while
TiO$_{2}$[s] and SiO$_{2}$[s] dominate the equatorial regions.

incompressible fluid, and it is well known that the equation describes the
evolution of unidirectional waves of small amplitude and long wavelength fairly
accurately if the waves fall into the Boussinesq regime.
  The KdV equation allows a balance of nonlinear steepening effects and
dispersive spreading which leads to the formation of steady wave profiles in
the form of solitary waves and cnoidal waves. While these wave profiles are
solutions of the KdV equation for any amplitude, it is shown here that there
for both the solitary and the cnoidal waves, there are critical amplitudes for
which the horizontal component of the particle velocity matches the phase
velocity of the wave. Solitary or cnoidal solutions of the KdV equation which
surpass these amplitudes feature incipient wave breaking as the particle
velocity exceeds the phase velocity near the crest of the wave, and the model
breaks down due to violation of the kinematic surface boundary condition.
  The condition for breaking can be conveniently formulated as a convective
breaking criterion based on the local Froude number at the wave crest. This
breaking criterion can also be applied to time-dependent situations, and one
case of interest is the development of an undular bore created by an influx at
a lateral boundary. It is shown that this boundary forcing leads to wave
breaking in the leading wave behind the bore if a certain threshold is
surpassed.

we find that the values of tetragonal shear constant show a consistent trend :
a high positive value for materials not prone to tetragonal transition and low
or negative for others. In the literature, materials, which have been seen to
undergo the martensite transition, are found to be metallic in nature. We probe

with varying composition, where the systems have similar global crystalline
structure (CsCl+fcc). Biased Monte Carlo simulations using umbrella sampling
technique shows that the free energy cost to create a CsCl nucleus increases as
the composition of the smaller particles are decreased. We find that the
systems with comparatively lower free energy cost to form CsCl nucleus exhibit
more pronounced pre-crystalline demixing near the liquid/crystal interface. The
structural frustration between the CsCl and fcc crystal demands this demixing.
We show that closer to the equimolar mixture the entropic penalty for demixing
is lower and a glass forming system may crystallize spontaneously when seeded
with a nucleus. This entropic penalty as a function of composition shows a
non-monotonic behavior with a maximum at a composition similar to the well
known Kob-Anderson (KA) model. Although the KA model shows the maximum entropic
penalty and thus maximum frustration against CsCl formation, it also shows a
strong tendency towards crystallization into fcc lattice of the larger ""A""
particles which can be explained from the study of the energetics. Thus for
systems closer to the equimolar mixture although it is the requirement of
demixing which provides their stability against crystallization, for KA model
it is not demixing but slow dynamics and structural frustration caused by the
locally favored structure around the smaller ""B"" particles which make it a good
glass former. Although the glass forming binary systems studied here are quite
similar, differing only in composition, we find that their glass forming
ability cannot be attributed to a single phenomena.

enhancement particularly significant for d waves; for K to E119, the

variations due to rotational modulation and the flare events were modelled
separately. 92 different data subsets separated using the analytic models
described in the literature were modelled separately to obtain the cool spot
configuration. It is seen that just one component of the system is
chromospherically active star. On this component, there are two active regions
separated by about 180 deg longitudinally between the latitudes of +50 deg and
+100 deg, whose locations and forms are rapidly changing in short time
intervals. 240 flares were detected and their parameters were computed. Using
these parameters, the One Phase Exponential Association (hereafter OPEA)
function model was derived, in which the Plateau value as a saturation level of
the flare-equivalent duration was found to be 1.232 s for KIC 9641031, and
half-life parameter was found to be 2291.7 s. The flare frequency N1 was found
to be 0.41632 h-1, while the flare frequency N2 was found to be 0.00027.
Considering these parameters together with the orbital period variations
demonstrates that the period variations directly depend on chromospheric

mechanisms have since been proposed to explain the observations. In these
mechanisms, the observed ENAs emerge from source plasmas located at different
distances from the Sun. Since each part of the sky is observed by IBEX twice
during the year from opposite sides of the Sun, the apparent position of the
ribbon as observed in the sky is shifted due to parallax. To determine the
ribbon parallax, we found the precise location of the maximum signal of the
ribbon observed in each orbital arc. The obtained apparent positions were
subsequently corrected for the Compton-Getting effect, gravitational
deflection, and radiation pressure. Finally, we selected a part of the ribbon
where its position is similar between the IBEX energy passbands. We compared
the apparent positions obtained from the viewing locations on the opposite
sides of the Sun, and found that they are shifted by a parallax angle of

observed a transit of the inflated Hot Jupiter HAT-P-32b with MODS at the LBT
to characterize its atmosphere from 3300 to 10000 AA. A time series of target
and reference star spectra was binned in two broad-band wavelength channels,
from which differential transit light curves were constructed. These broad-band
light curves were used to confirm previous transit parameter determinations. To
derive the planetary transmission spectrum with a resolution of R ~ 60, we
created a chromatic set of 62 narrow-band light curves with an average
wavelength width of about 100 AA. The spectrum was corrected for the
third-light of a near-by M star, whose spectrum was resolved in the individual
exposures. Additionally, we undertook a photometric monitoring campaign of the
host star to correct for the influence of starspots. The transmission spectrum
of HAT-P-32b shows no pressure-broadened absorption features from Na and K,
which is interpreted by the presence of clouds or hazes in the planetary
atmosphere. This result is in agreement to previous studies on the same planet.
The presence of TiO in gas phase could be ruled out. We find a 2.8 sigma
indication of increased absorption in the line core of potassium (KI~7699 AA).
No narrow absorption features of Na and Halpha were detected. Furthermore,
tentative indications were found for a slope of increasing opacity toward blue
wavelengths from the near-IR to the near-UV with an amplitude of two scale
heights. If confirmed by follow-up observations, it can be explained by
aerosols either causing Mie scattering or causing Rayleigh scattering with an

compensate strong plasmon damping and lead to the population of high plasmon

based on the plasmon reduced density matrix. With this approach, we have
extended the simulations to more than $50$ molecules and shown that the plasmon

domain around every Lagrangian point, called ""Moser domain"" and represent the
orbits that constitute the chaotic spiral arms. In fact, these orbits are not
only along the invariant manifolds, but also in a domain surrounding the
invariant manifolds. We show further that orbits starting outside the Moser
domain but close to it converge to the boundary of the Moser domain, which acts
as an attractor. These orbits stay for a long time close to the spiral arms

that at least one pair of echelle ridges is shifted to midway between the
spacing for 22 stars. The estimated rotational frequencies compared to the
shifts revealed rotationally split doublets, triplets and multiplets not only
for single frequencies, but for the complete echelle ridges in 31 delta Scuti

filtering arbitrary number of subcarriers to suppress out of band (OoB)
emission, while keeping the orthogonality between subbands and subcarriers
within one subband. However, subband filtering may affect system performance
and capacity in a number of ways. In this paper, we first propose the
conditions for interference-free one-tap equalization and corresponding signal
model in the frequency domain for multi-user (MU) UFMC system. Based on this
ideal interference-free case, impact of subband filtering on the system
performance is analyzed in terms of average signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) per
subband, capacity per subcarrier and bit error rate (BER) and compared with the
orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) system. This is followed by
filter length selection strategies to provide guidelines for system design.
Next, by taking carrier frequency offset (CFO), timing offset (TO),
insufficient guard interval between symbols and filter tail cutting (TC) into
consideration, an analytical system model is established. New channel
equalization algorithms are proposed by considering the errors and
imperfections based on the derived signal models. In addition, a set of
optimization criteria in terms of filter length and guard interval/filter TC
length subject to various constraints is formulated to maximize the system
capacity. Numerical results show that the analytical and corresponding optimal
approaches match the simulation results, and the proposed equalization
algorithms can significantly improve the BER performance.

structures a priority target in star formation studies. The datasets of the
Herschel Galactic Cold Cores Key Programme allow for a statistical study of
filaments with a wide range of intrinsic and environmental characteristics.
Characterisation of this sample can be used to identify key physical parameters
and quantify the role of environment in the formation of supercritical
filaments. Filaments were extracted from fields at D<500pc with the
getfilaments algorithm and characterised according to their column density
profiles and intrinsic properties. Each profile was fitted with a
beam-convolved Plummer-like function and quantified based on the relative
contributions from the filament 'core', represented by a Gaussian, and 'wing'
component, dominated by the power-law of the Plummer-like function. These
parameters were examined for populations associated with different background
levels. We find that filaments increase their core (Mcore) and wing (Mwing)
contributions while increasing their total linear mass density (Mtot). Both
components appear to be linked to the local environment, with filaments in
higher backgrounds having systematically more massive Mcore and Mwing. This
dependence on the environment supports an accretion-based model for filament
evolution in the local neighbourhood (D<500pc). Structures located in the
highest backgrounds develop the highest central Av, Mcore, and Mwing as Mtot
increases with time, favoured by the local availability of material and the
enhanced gravitational potential. Our results indicate that filaments acquiring
a significantly massive central region with Mcore>Mcrit/2 may become
supercritical and form stars. This translates into a need for filaments to

the 4 Gyr-old open cluster M 67 (= NGC 2682), obtained by analysing data from
Campaign 5 of the K2 mission with the Kepler Space Telescope. The rotation
periods delineate a sequence in the color-period diagram (CPD) of increasing
period with redder color. This sequence represents a cross-section at the
cluster age of the surface P = P (t, M), suggested in prior work to extend to
at least solar age. The current Sun is located marginally (approx. one sigma)
above M 67 in the CPD, as its relative age leads us to expect, and lies on the
P = P (t, M) surface to within measurement precision. We therefore conclude
that the solar rotation rate is normal, as compared with cluster stars, a fact
which strengthens the solar-stellar connection. The agreement between the M\,67
rotation period measurements and prior predictions further implies that
rotation periods, especially when coupled with appropriate supporting work such
as spectroscopy, can provide reliable ages via gyrochronology for other similar
FGK dwarfs from the early main sequence to solar age and likely till the main
sequence turnoff. The M 67 rotators have a rotational age of 4.2 Gyr, with a
standard deviation of 0.7 Gyr, implying that similar field stars can be
age-dated to precisions of ~17%. The rotational age of the M 67 cluster as a
whole is therefore 4.2 Gyr, but with a lower (averaged) uncertainty of 0.2 Gyr.

on recently formulated general description of open quantum gravitational
systems, we analyse the propagation of scalar, electromagnetic, and
gravitational waves on both long and short time scales with respect to their
mean frequencies. For the long time propagation, the Markov approximation is
employed that neglects the effects of initial conditions of these waves. In
this case, despite intuitively expected decoherence and dissipation from the

gravity but otherwise free. The short time effects are then recovered through
the transient non-Markovian evolution. Focusing on scalar bosons in initially
incoherent states, we find that the resulting quantum dissipation depend
strongly on the distribution of the particle momentum states. We further
identify a hitherto undiscovered collective anti-dissipation mechanism for a
large number of particles. The surprising new effect tends to ""bundle""
identical particles within a sharply distributed momentum states having a width
inversely proportional to the particle number due to the thermal fluctuations,

significantly decreases in comparison to a single YIG film due to the
excitation of microwave eddy currents in a Pt coat. By introducing a novel
excitation geometry, where the Pt layer faces the ground plane of a microstrip
line structure, we suppressed the excitation of the eddy currents in the Pt
layer and, thus, achieved a large increase in the transmission of the
Damon-Eshbach surface spin wave. At the same time, no visible influence of an
external dc current applied to the Pt layer on the spin-wave amplitude in the
YIG-Pt bi-layer was observed in our experiments with YIG films of micrometer

potential applications of the set of $k$ best \emph{cascading via-paths} (CVPs)
and the \emph{reciprocal pointer chain} (RPC) method for identifying them. CVPs
are a collection of up to $|V|$ paths between a source and a target node in a
graph $G = (V,E)$, computed using two shortest path trees, that have
distinctive properties relative to other path sets. They have been shown to be
particularly useful in geospatial applications, where they are an intuitive and
efficient means for identifying a set of spatially diverse alternatives to the
single shortest path between the source and target. However, spatial diversity
is not intrinsic to paths in a graph, and little theory has been developed
outside of application to describe the nature of these paths and the RPC method
in general. Here we divorce the RPC method from its typical geospatial
applications and develop a comprehensive theory of CVPs from an abstract
graph-theoretic perspective. Restricting ourselves to properties of the CVPs
and of the entire set of $k$-best CVPs that can be computed in $O(|E| + |V|
\log |V|)$, we are able to then propose, among other things, new and efficient
approaches to problems such as generating a diverse set of paths and to
computing the $k$ shortest loopless paths between two nodes in a graph. We
conclude by demonstrating the new theory in practice, first for a typical
application of finding alternative routes in road networks and then for a novel
application of identifying layer-boundaries in ground-penetrating radar (GPR)
data. It is our hope that by generalizing the RPC method, providing a sound
theoretical foundation, and demonstrating novel uses, we are able to broaden
its perceived applicability and stimulate new research in this area, both

demonstrated whereby approach and departure trajectories to a given airport are

using Gaussian Processes (GPs). Furthermore it is shown that this approach can
be used to either select probabilistic regions of airspace where trajectories
are likely and - if required - can automatically generate a set of

renormalisation of an extension of QED in a flat spacetime where the photons

will refer to this model as Bimetric QED (BIMQED). As a preliminary we discuss
the formulation of electrodynamics in a pre-metric formalism showing
nevertheless that there is, on the basis of a simple criteron, a preferred
metric. Arising from this choice of metric is a Weyl-like tensor (WLT). The
Petrov classification of the WLT gives rise to a corresponding classification
of Lorentz symmetry breaking. We do not impose any constraint on the strength
of the symmetry breaking and are able to obtain explicit dispersion relations
for photon propagation in each of the Petrov classes. The associated
birefringence appears in some cases as two distinct polarisation dependent
lightcones and in other cases as a a more complicated structure that cannot be
disentangled in a simple way.
  We show how in BIMQED the renormalisation procedure can, in addition to its
effect on standard parameters such as charge and mass, force the
renormalisation of the metrics and the WLT. Two particularly tractable cases
are studied in detail for which we can obtain renormalisation group flows for
the parameters of the model together with an analysis of fixed point structure.
Of course these results are consistent with previous studies but we are not
constrained to treat Lorentz symmetry breaking as necessarily weak. As we found
in a previous study of a scalar field theory model an acceptable causal
structure for the model imposes constraints on relationship between the various
lightcones in BIMQED.

fundamental problem in many-body physics. The interest in this field has been
renewed due to recent ground-breaking experiments with ultra-cold Fermi gases.
Optical creation of an exciton or a polariton in a two-dimensional electron
system embedded in a microcavity constitutes a new frontier for this field due
to an interplay between cavity-coupling favoring ultra-low mass polariton
formation and exciton-electron interactions leading to polaron or trion
formation. Here, we present cavity spectroscopy of gate-tunable monolayer
MoSe$_2$ exhibiting strongly bound trion and polaron resonances, as well as
non-perturbative coupling to a single microcavity mode. As the electron density
is increased, the oscillator strength determined from the polariton splitting
is gradually transferred from the higher-energy repulsive-exciton-polaron
resonance to the lower-energy attractive-polaron manifold. Simultaneous
observation of polariton formation in both attractive and repulsive branches
indicate a new regime of polaron physics where the polariton impurity mass is
much smaller than that of the electrons. Our findings shed new light on optical
response of semiconductors in the presence of free carriers by identifying the
Fermi polaron nature of excitonic resonances and constitute a first step in

mathematical study of fluid dynamics. Not only is the global regularity for
smooth initial data an open issue, but the behaviour may also depend on the
presence or absence of boundaries.
  For a good understanding, it is crucial to carry out, besides mathematical
studies, high-accuracy and well-resolved numerical exploration. Such studies
can be very demanding in computational resources, but recently it has been
shown that very substantial gains can be achieved first, by using Cauchy's
Lagrangian formulation of the Euler equations and second, by taking advantages
of analyticity results of the Lagrangian trajectories for flows whose initial
vorticity is H\""older-continuous. The latter has been known for about twenty
years (Serfati, 1995), but the combination of the two, which makes use of
recursion relations among time-Taylor coefficients to obtain constructively the
time-Taylor series of the Lagrangian map, has been achieved only recently
(Frisch and Zheligovsky, 2014; Podvigina {\em et al.}, 2016 and references
therein).
  Here we extend this methodology to incompressible Euler flow in an
impermeable bounded domain whose boundary may be either analytic or have a
regularity between indefinite differentiability and analyticity.
Non-constructive regularity results for these cases have already been obtained
by Glass {\em et al.} (2012). Using the invariance of the boundary under the
Lagrangian flow, we establish novel recursion relations that include
contributions from the boundary. This leads to a constructive proof of
time-analyticity of the Lagrangian trajectories with analytic boundaries, which
can then be used subsequently for the design of a very high-order
Cauchy--Lagrangian method.

for the momentum balance. For non-vanishing stress contribution in the boundary
condition, the problem is actually shown to have $L_p$-maximal regularity under
the natural compatibility conditions. Aiming at an existence theory for
problems in weakly singular domains, where different boundary conditions apply
on different parts of the boundary such that these surfaces meet orthogonally,
we also consider the prototype domain of a wedge with opening angle
$\frac{\pi}{2}$ and different combinations of boundary conditions: Navier-Slip

their dramatic differences in resolution. Here, we present a method to filter
out the small-scale component of vector fields, in such a way that comparison

directly made. Our approach extends the technique widely used to decompose the
radial component of the solar magnetic field to the azimuthal and meridional
components as well. For that, we self-consistently decompose the
three-components of the vector field using spherical harmonics of different $l$
degrees. By retaining the low $l$ degrees in the decomposition, we are able to
calculate the large-scale magnetic field vector. Using a synoptic map of the
solar vector field at Carrington Rotation CR2109, we derive the solar magnetic
field vector at a similar resolution level as that from stellar magnetic
images. We demonstrate that the large-scale field of the Sun is not purely
radial, as often assumed -- at CR2109, $83\%$ of the magnetic energy is in the
radial component, while $10\%$ is in the azimuthal and $7\%$ is in the
meridional components. By separating the vector field into poloidal and
toroidal components, we show that the solar magnetic energy at CR2109 is mainly
($>90\%$) poloidal. Our description is entirely consistent with the description
adopted in several stellar studies. Our formalism can also be used to confront
synoptic maps synthesised in numerical simulations of dynamo and magnetic flux

  Engineering",,"10.1016/j.cma.2016.05.012",,"cs.CE","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The objective of this work is the development of a novel finite element
formulation describing the contact interaction of slender beams in complex 3D
configurations involving arbitrary beam-to-beam orientations. It is shown in a
mathematically concise manner that standard beam contact models based on a
point-wise contact force fail to describe a considerable range of
configurations, which are, however, likely to occur in practical applications.
On the contrary, the formulation proposed here models beam-to-beam contact by
means of distributed line forces, a procedure that is shown to be applicable
for arbitrary geometrical configurations. The proposed formulation is based on
a Gauss-point-to-segment type contact discretization and a penalty
regularization of the contact constraint. By means of detailed theoretical and
numerical investigations, it is shown that this approach is more suitable for
beam contact than possible alternatives based on mortar type contact
discretizations or constraint enforcement by means of Lagrange multipliers. The
proposed formulation is enhanced by a consistently linearized integration
interval segmentation avoiding numerical integration across strong
discontinuities. In combination with a smoothed contact force law and the
employed C1-continuous beam elements, this procedure drastically reduces the
numerical integration error, an essential prerequisite for optimal spatial
convergence rates. The resulting line-to-line contact algorithm is supplemented
by contact contributions of the beam endpoints, which represent boundary minima
of the underlying minimal distance problem. Finally, a series of numerical test
cases is analyzed in order to investigate the accuracy and consistency of the
proposed formulation regarding integration error, spatial convergence behavior
and resulting contact force distributions.

tracking pedestrians in extremely crowded scenes, we are limited to only few
works. This is an important problem which gives rise to several challenges.
Pre-trained object detectors fail to localize targets in crowded sequences.
This consequently limits the use of data-association based multi-target
tracking methods which rely on the outcome of an object detector. Additionally,
the small apparent target size makes it challenging to extract features to
discriminate targets from their surroundings. Finally, the large number of
targets greatly increases computational complexity which in turn makes it hard
to extend existing multi-target tracking approaches to high-density crowd
scenarios. In this paper, we propose a tracker that addresses the
aforementioned problems and is capable of tracking hundreds of people
efficiently. We formulate online crowd tracking as Binary Quadratic Programing.
Our formulation employs target's individual information in the form of
appearance and motion as well as contextual cues in the form of neighborhood
motion, spatial proximity and grouping constraints, and solves detection and
data association simultaneously. In order to solve the proposed quadratic
optimization efficiently, where state-of art commercial quadratic programing
solvers fail to find the answer in a reasonable amount of time, we propose to
use the most recent version of the Modified Frank Wolfe algorithm, which takes
advantage of SWAP-steps to speed up the optimization. We show that the proposed
formulation can track hundreds of targets efficiently and improves state-of-art
results by significant margins on eleven challenging high density crowd

from May 2009 to January 2015, the most extensive information of this type yet
available, to reconstruct the stellar magnetic field, we produce multiple 3D
magnetohydrodynamic stellar wind models. Our results show that characteristic
changes in the large-scale magnetic field as the star undergoes magnetic cycles
produce changes in the wind properties, both globally and locally at the
position of the orbiting planet. Whilst the mass loss rate of the star varies
by only a minimal amount ($\sim$ 4 percent), the rates of angular momentum loss
and associated spin-down timescales are seen to vary widely (up to $\sim$ 140
percent), findings consistent with and extending previous research. In
addition, we find that temporal variation in the global wind is governed mainly
by changes in total magnetic flux rather than changes in wind plasma
properties. The magnetic pressure varies with time and location and dominates
the stellar wind pressure at the planetary orbit. By assuming a Jovian
planetary magnetic field for {\tau} Boo b, we nevertheless conclude that the
planetary magnetosphere can remain stable in size for all observed stellar
cycle epochs, despite significant changes in the stellar field and the
resulting local space weather environment.

reflect the evolution of the global background magnetic field during the

magnetic flux-tube is anti-correlated with its expansion ratio, which motivated
the definition of widely-used semi-empirical scaling laws relating one to the
other. In practice, such scaling laws require ad-hoc corrections. A predictive
law based solely on physical principles is still missing. We test whether the
flux-tube expansion is the controlling factor of the wind speed at all phases
of the cycle and at all latitudes using a very large sample of wind-carrying
open magnetic flux-tubes. We furthermore search for additional physical
parameters based on the geometry of the coronal magnetic field which have an
influence on the terminal wind flow speed. We use MHD simulations of the corona
and wind coupled to a dynamo model to provide a large statistical ensemble of
open flux-tubes which we analyse conjointly in order to identify relations of
dependence between the wind speed and geometrical parameters of the flux-tubes
which are valid globally (for all latitudes and moments of the cycle). Our
study confirms that the terminal speed of the solar wind depends very strongly
on the geometry of the open magnetic flux-tubes through which it flows. The
total flux-tube expansion is more clearly anti-correlated with the wind speed
for fast rather than for slow wind flows, and effectively controls the
locations of these flows during solar minima. Overall, the actual asymptotic
wind speeds attained are also strongly dependent on field-line inclination and
magnetic field amplitude at the foot-points. We suggest ways of including these
parameters on future predictive scaling-laws for the solar wind speed.

earthquake clusters consisting of similar waveforms. Repeating waveforms are
often recorded at volcanoes, where, however, the crust structure is expected to
contain strong heterogeneities and therefore the 1D velocity model assumption
that is made in most location strategies is not likely to describe reality. A
peculiar cluster of repeating low-frequency seismic events was recorded on the
south flank of Katla volcano (Iceland) from 2011. As the hypocentres are
located at the rim of the glacier, the seismicity may be due to volcanic or
glacial processes. Information on the size and shape of the cluster may help
constraining the source process. The extreme similarity of waveforms points to
a very small spatial distribution of hypocentres. In order to extract
meaningful information about size and shape of the cluster, we minimize
uncertainty by optimizing the cross-correlation measurements and
relative-relocation process. With a synthetic test we determine the best
parameters for differential-time measurements and estimate their uncertainties,
specifically for each waveform. We design a relocation strategy to work without
a predefined velocity model, by formulating and inverting the problem to seek
changes in both location and slowness, thus accounting for azimuth, take-off
angles and velocity deviations from a 1D model. We solve the inversion
explicitly in order to propagate data errors through the calculation. With this
approach we are able to resolve a source volume few tens of meters wide on
horizontal directions and around 100 meters in depth. There is no suggestion
that the hypocentres lie on a single fault plane and the depth distribution
indicates that their source is unlikely to be related to glacial processes as
the ice thickness is not expected to exceed few tens of meters in the source
area.

T_C can be high. Thermal disorder of the lattice perturbs the strongly coupled

incoherent potential fluctuations of the Madelung term and reduced spin-phonon

fluctuations can persist on a shorter length scale at higher temperatures.
BCS-type model calculations are used to show how disorder can reduce the

preparation to turn to corresponding pre-metric nonlinearization. After some
preliminary examples and notes on nonlinearization, we motivate our view for
existence and explicit formulation of time stable subsystems of the physical
field objects considered. Section 5 presents the formal results of our approach
on the pre-metric nonlinear formulations in static case, in time-dependent
case, and in space-time formulation. In the Conclusion we give our general view
on ""why and how to nonlinearize"". The Appendix gives a possible formal
extension of our aproach to many subsystem field objects.

stays bounded in an arbitrarily small neighborhood of a static equilibrium
configuration under small perturbations in positions and velocities. This type
of stability is highly desired in robotic applications that involve multiple
unilateral contacts. Nevertheless, Lyapunov stability analysis of such systems
is extremely difficult, because even small perturbations may result in hybrid
dynamics where the solution involves many nonsmooth transitions between
different contact states. This paper concerns with Lyapunov stability analysis
of a planar rigid body with two frictional unilateral contacts under inelastic
impacts, for a general class of equilibrium configurations under a constant
external load. The hybrid dynamics of the system under contact transitions and
impacts is formulated, and a \Poincare map at two-contact states is introduced.
Using invariance relations, this \Poincare map is reduced into two
semi-analytic scalar functions that entirely encode the dynamic behavior of
solutions under any small initial perturbation. These two functions enable
determination of Lyapunov stability or instability for almost any equilibrium
state. The results are demonstrated via simulation examples and by plotting
stability and instability regions in two-dimensional parameter spaces that
describe the contact geometry and external load.

by Einstein's theory of general relativity and is supported by observations.
Black holes obey quantum mechanics and evaporate spontaneously. Here it is
shown that a mass rate $R_f\sim 3\times 10^{-8} (M_0/M)^{1/2}$ $M_0$ yr$^{-1}$

We investigate a percolation model for this problem, which is a generalization
of site percolation. We give a relation between the probability of the number
of chosen sites around a site and the size of clusters. We also see the
expected number of infinite clusters, and the exponential tail decay of the

  analysis",,,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  This paper presents a novel face and periocular biometric fusion at feature
level using canonical correlation analysis. Face recognition itself has
limitations such as illumination, pose, expression, occlusion etc. Also,
periocular biometrics has spectacles, head angle, hair and expression as its
limitations. Unimodal biometrics cannot surmount all these limitations. The
recognition accuracy can be increased by fusing dual information (face and
periocular) from a single source (face image) using canonical correlation
analysis (CCA). This work also proposes a new wavelet decomposed local binary
pattern (WD-LBP) feature extractor which provides sufficient features for
fusion. A detailed analysis on face and periocular biometrics shows that WD-LBP
features are more accurate and faster than local binary pattern (LBP) and gabor
wavelet. The experimental results using Muct face database reveals that the
proposed multimodal biometrics performs better than the unimodal biometrics.

the information such as gender, age, expression and ethnicity provided by the
face image. In order to obtain these information, feature extraction plays a
major role. In this paper, retrieval of age, gender, expression and race
information from an individual face image is analysed using different feature
extraction methods. The performance of four major feature extraction methods
such as Active Appearance Model (AAM), Gabor wavelets, Local Binary Pattern
(LBP) and Wavelet Decomposition (WD) are analyzed for gender recognition, age
estimation, expression recognition and racial recognition in terms of accuracy
(recognition rate), time for feature extraction, neural training and time to
test an image. Each of this recognition system is compared with four feature
extractors on same dataset (training and validation set) to get a better
understanding in its performance. Experiments carried out on FG-NET,
Cohn-Kanade, PAL face database shows that each method has its own merits and
demerits. Hence it is practically impossible to define a method which is best
at all circumstances with less computational complexity. Further, a detailed
comparison of age estimation and age estimation using gender information is
provided along with a solution to overcome aging effect in case of gender
recognition. An attempt has been made in obtaining all (i.e. gender, age range,
expression and ethnicity) information from a test image in a single go.

of a sample is a major burden in recovering 2D and 3D information in time
resolved spectral imaging. This problem cannot be addressed by conventional
denoising and signal processing techniques as it heavily depends on the physics
of the acquisition. Here we propose and implement an algorithmic framework
based on low-rank matrix recovery and alternating minimization that exploits
the forward model for THz acquisition. The method allows recovering the
original signal in spite of the presence of temporal-spatial distortions. We
address a blind-demodulation problem, where based on several observations of
the sample texture modulated by an undesired sweep pattern, the two classes of
signals are separated. The performance of the method is examined in both
synthetic and experimental data, and the successful reconstructions are
demonstrated. The proposed general scheme can be implemented to advance
inspection and imaging applications in THz and other time-resolved sensing
modalities.
