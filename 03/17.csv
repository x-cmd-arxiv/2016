While high-order spatial modes have been widely exploited for dense coding and
high-dimensional quantum information processing, the properties of polarization
preservation of high-order spatial beams propagating in turbulent atmosphere
have not been comprehensively investigated yet. Here we focus on the properties
of polarization preservation of partially coherent Hermite-Gaussian beams
propagating along different atmospheric turbulence paths. The analytical
expressions for the polarization of partially coherent Hermite-Gaussian beams
propagating through atmospheric turbulence along different paths have been
derived. It is shown that the larger the coherence length is, and the larger
the beam order m, n are, the less the polarization is changed. We find that the
evolution properties of the polarization in slant-down paths through turbulent
atmosphere are similar to the case in free space if the condition zenith angle
{\xi}<{\pi}/4 is satisfied. While at a long propagation distance, evolution
properties of polarization in horizontal paths of turbulent atmosphere differs
much from that in free space and in slant paths. The results may allow one to
choose the optimal propagation path in terms of specific applications, which is
helpful for future experimental implementation of multiple-degrees-of-freedom

services by spreading redundancy across a large group of storage nodes. In such
a large system, node failures take place on a regular basis. When a storage
node breaks down, a replacement node is expected to regenerate the redundant
data as soon as possible in order to maintain the same level of redundancy.
Previous results have been mainly focused on the minimization of network
traffic in regeneration. However, in practical networks, where link capacities
vary in a wide range, minimizing network traffic does not always yield the
minimum regeneration time. In this paper, we investigate two approaches to the
problem of minimizing regeneration time in networks with heterogeneous link
capacities. The first approach is to download different amounts of repair data
from the helping nodes according to the link capacities. The second approach
generalizes the conventional star-structured regeneration topology to
tree-structured topologies so that we can utilize the links between helping
nodes with bypassing low-capacity links. Simulation results show that the
flexible tree-structured regeneration scheme that combines the advantages of
both approaches can achieve a substantial reduction in the regeneration time.

therefore present a new method designed for on-line operation. It selects
promising candidates using a purpose-built tree-based machine learning
classifier, the Gaussian Hellinger Very Fast Decision Tree (GH-VFDT), and a new
set of features for describing candidates. The features have been chosen so as
to i) maximise the separation between candidates arising from noise and those
of probable astrophysical origin, and ii) be as survey-independent as possible.
Using these features our new approach can process millions of candidates in
seconds (~1 million every 15 seconds), with high levels of pulsar recall
(90%+). This technique is therefore applicable to the large volumes of data
expected to be produced by the Square Kilometre Array (SKA). Use of this

varying density and covers a broad spectrum with maximum frequency close to the
maximum plasma frequency. In the case of a sharp vacuum-plasma boundary, the
radiation is generated symmetrically at the plasma entrance and exit, and its
properties are independent of plasma density when the density exceeds a
characteristic value determined by the product of the plasma frequency and the
laser pulse duration. For a diffuse vacuum-plasma boundary, the emission from
the plasma entrance and exit is asymmetric: increasing and decreasing density
ramps enhance and diminish the radiated energy respectively. Enhancements by
factors of 50 are found and simulations show that a 1.66 J, 50 fs driver pulse

The pressure bump close to the outer edge of the dead-zone leads to particle
trapping in ring structures. More specifically, vortices in the disk
concentrate the dust and create an inhomogeneous distribution of the solid
material in the azimuthal direction. The large-scale disk perturbations are
preserved in the (sub)mm re-emission maps. The observable structures are very
similar to those expected to result from planet-disk interaction. The larger
dust particles increase the brightness contrast between gap and ring

could be traced with ALMA down to a scale of a few astronomical units in
circumstellar disks located in nearby star-forming regions. Finally, we present
a brief comparison of these structures with those recently found with ALMA in

hardness results for the $k$-coloring problem. There is a class ${\cal H}$ of
host graphs. One selects a graph $H\in{\cal H}$ and plants in it a balanced
$k$-coloring (by partitioning the vertex set into $k$ roughly equal parts, and
removing all edges within each part). The resulting graph $G$ is given as input
to a polynomial time algorithm that needs to $k$-color $G$ (any legal
$k$-coloring would do -- the algorithm is not required to recover the planted
$k$-coloring). Earlier planted models correspond to the case that ${\cal H}$ is
the class of all $n$-vertex $d$-regular graphs, a member $H\in{\cal H}$ is
chosen at random, and then a balanced $k$-coloring is planted at random. Blum
and Spencer [1995] designed algorithms for this model when $d=n^{\delta}$ (for
$0<\delta\le1$), and Alon and Kahale [1997] managed to do so even when $d$ is a
sufficiently large constant.
  The new aspect in our framework is that it need not involve randomness. In
one model within the framework (with $k=3$) $H$ is a $d$ regular spectral
expander (meaning that except for the largest eigenvalue of its adjacency
matrix, every other eigenvalue has absolute value much smaller than $d$) chosen
by an adversary, and the planted 3-coloring is random. We show that the
3-coloring algorithm of Alon and Kahale [1997] can be modified to apply to this
case. In another model $H$ is a random $d$-regular graph but the planted
balanced $3$-coloring is chosen by an adversary, after seeing $H$. We show that
for a certain range of average degrees somewhat below $\sqrt{n}$, finding a
3-coloring is NP-hard. Together these results (and other results that we have)
help clarify which aspects of randomness in the planted coloring model are the
key to successful 3-coloring algorithms.

contains only monopole and quadrupole terms. At scales greater than the void
radius, linear theory is a good match to voids traced out by haloes in N-body
simulations; small-scale random velocities are unimportant at these radii, only
tending to cause small and often negligible elongation of the redshift-space
cross-correlation function near its origin. By extracting the monopole and
quadrupole from the cross-correlation function, we measure the linear growth
rate without prior knowledge of the void profile or velocity dispersion. We
recover the linear growth parameter $\beta$ to 9% precision from an effective
volume of 3(Gpc/h)^3 using voids with radius greater than 25Mpc/h. Smaller
voids are predominantly sub-voids, which may be more sensitive to the random
velocity dispersion; they introduce noise and do not help to improve the
measurement. Adding velocity dispersion as a free parameter allows us to use
information at radii as small as half of the void radius. The precision on
$\beta$ is reduced to approximately 5%. Contrary to the simple redshift-space
distortion pattern in overdensities, voids show diverse shapes in redshift
space, and can appear either elongated or flattened along the line of sight.
This can be explained by the competing amplitudes of the local density
contrast, plus the radial velocity profile and its gradient, with the latter
two factors being determined by the cumulative density profile of voids. The
distortion pattern is therefore determined solely by the void profile and is
different for void-in-cloud and void-in-void. This diversity of redshift-space
void morphology complicates measurements of the Alcock-Paczynski effect using

spin period at a certain distance from the massive companion. Our calculations
follow, as a function of time (on a total time scale of several hours), the
transition of the system through all different accretion regimes that are
triggered by the intrinsic variations in the density and velocity of the

each time step by taking into account the relevant physical processes occurring
in the different accretion regimes. Synthetic lightcurves are derived and
qualitatively compared with those observed from classical supergiant high mass

simplifications are assumed in these calculations, we show that taking into

traditional algorithms are not adequate and manual review is time consuming. By
using ANNs to predict nominal vehicle performance based solely on information

automatically identified in the post-run data. Such capability is only now
becoming available due to the rapid increase in understanding of ANN framework

purpose of this investigation is relatively simple, to keep the computing
requirements within the parameters of a modern desktop PC. This ANN showed
potential in predicting vehicle performance, particularly during transient

such as steady state operation and cases which did not have sufficient training

power becomes more readily available, ANN understanding matures, and more
training data is acquired from real world tests, the performance predictions of

configuration is determined by a Hartree-Fock solution of the Hubbard model

parameters of an effective spin Hamiltonian are obtained by taking into account
the hybridization effects and spin-orbit coupling. We show that only the former

description of the anisotropic magnetization process. While our calculations
confirm that the canted zero-field ground state arises from a competition
between ferromagnetic nearest-neighbor and antiferromagnetic

are crucial for fixing spin directions and for the overall magnetization
process. We thus show that the Hartree-Fock solution of an electronic

and relativistic particle acceleration are energetically key in these events.
Further evidence for shocks comes from thermal keV X-ray emission and an early
peak in the radio light curve on a timescale of months with a brightness
temperature which is too high to result from freely expanding photo-ionized
gas. Paper I developed a one dimensional model for the thermal emission from
nova shocks. This work concluded that the shock-powered radio peak cannot be
thermal if line cooling operates in the post-shock gas at the rate determined
by collisional ionization equilibrium. Here we extend this calculation to
include non-thermal synchrotron emission. Applying our model to three classical
novae, we constrain the amplification of the magnetic field $\epsilon_B$ and
the efficiency $\epsilon_e$ of accelerating relativistic electrons of
characteristic Lorentz factor $\gamma \sim 100$. If the shocks are radiative
(low velocity $v_{\rm sh} \lesssim 1000$ km s$^{-1}$) and cover a large solid
angle of the nova outflow, as likely characterize those producing gamma-rays,
then values of $\epsilon_e \sim 0.01-0.1$ are required to achieve the peak
radio brightness for $\epsilon_B = 10^{-2}$. Such high efficiencies exclude
secondary pairs from pion decay as the source of the radio-emitting particles,
instead favoring the direct acceleration of electrons at the shock. If the
radio-emitting shocks are instead adiabatic (high velocity), as likely
characterize those responsible for the thermal X-rays, then much higher
brightness temperatures are possible, allowing the radio-emitting shocks to
cover a smaller outflow solid angle.

in a large N limit. In this paper, after clarifying that all the tetrahedra
resulting in the original models are orientable, we define a version of
triangle-hinge models that can describe the dynamics of unoriented membranes.
By regarding each triangle as representing a propagation of an open membrane of
disk topology, we introduce a local worldvolume parity transformation which
inverts the orientation of triangle, and define unoriented triangle-hinge
models by gauging the transformation. Unlike two-dimensional cases, this local
transformation generally relates a manifold to a nonmanifold, but still is a
well-defined manipulation among tetrahedral decompositions. We further show
that matter fields can be introduced in the same way as in the original
oriented models. In particular, the models will describe unoriented membranes
in a target spacetime by taking matter fields to be the target space
coordinates.

safety guarantees to small-scale systems and is flexible in terms of system
dynamics. However, the exponential complexity scaling of HJ reachability
prevents its direct application to large scale problems when the number of
vehicles is greater than two. In this paper, we overcome the scalability
limitations of HJ reachability by using a mixed integer program that exploits
the properties of HJ solutions to provide higher-level control logic. Our
proposed method provides safety guarantee for three-vehicle systems -- a
previously intractable task for HJ reachability -- without incurring
significant additional computation cost. Furthermore, our method is scalable
beyond three vehicles and performs significantly better by several metrics than
an extension of pairwise collision avoidance to multi-vehicle collision
avoidance. We demonstrate our proposed method in simulations.

the large-scale magnetic evolution after inflation. Put together, the two can
slow down the adiabatic magnetic decay on superhorizon scales throughout the

colocated with Telescope Array, the conventional surface scintillation detector
(SD) and fluorescence telescope detector (FD) near Delta, Utah, U.S.A. The TARA
detector combines a 40 kW, 54.1 MHz VHF transmitter and high-gain transmitting
antenna which broadcasts the radar carrier over the SD array and within the FD
field of view, towards a 250 MS/s DAQ receiver. TARA has been collecting data
since 2013 with the primary goal of observing the radar signatures of extensive
air showers (EAS). Simulations indicate that echoes are expected to be short in
duration (~10 microseconds) and exhibit rapidly changing frequency, with rates
on the order of 1 MHz/microsecond. The EAS radar cross-section (RCS) is
currently unknown although it is the subject of over 70 years of speculation. A
novel signal search technique is described in which the expected radar echo of
a particular air shower is used as a matched filter template and compared to
waveforms obtained by triggering the radar DAQ using the Telescope Array
fluorescence detector. No evidence for the scattering of radio frequency
radiation by EAS is obtained to date. We report the first quantitative RCS
upper limits using EAS that triggered the Telescope Array Fluorescence
Detector.

models that integrate discrete stochastic events with continuous dynamics. The
time evolution of statistical moments is generally not closed for SHS, in the
sense that the time derivative of the lower-order moments depends on
higher-order moments. Here, we identify an important class of SHS where moment
dynamics is automatically closed, and hence moments can be computed exactly by
solving a system of coupled differential equations. This class is referred to
as linear time-triggered SHS (TTSHS), where the state evolves according to a
linear dynamical system. Stochastic events occur at discrete times and the
intervals between them are independent random variables that follow a general
class of probability distributions. Moreover, whenever the event occurs, the
state of the SHS changes randomly based on a probability distribution. Our
approach relies on embedding a Markov chain based on phase-type processes to
model timing of events, and showing that the resulting system has closed moment
dynamics. Interestingly, we identify a subclass of linear TTSHS, where the
first and second-order moments depend only on the mean time interval between
events and invariant of their higher-order statistics. Finally, we discuss
applicability of our results to different application areas such as network
control systems and systems biology.

seeded non-malleable extractors; 2. Constructing optimal privacy amplification
protocols with an active adversary, for any security parameter; 3. Constructing
extractors for independent weak random sources, when the min-entropy is
extremely small (i.e., near logarithmic).
  For the first two problems, the best known non-malleable extractors by
Chattopadhyay, Goyal and Li [CGL16], and by Cohen [Coh16a,Coh16b] all require
seed length and min-entropy at least $\log^2 (1/\epsilon)$, where $\epsilon$ is
the error of the extractor. As a result, the best known explicit privacy
amplification protocols with an active adversary, which achieve 2 rounds of
communication and optimal entropy loss in [Li15c,CGL16], can only handle
security parameter up to $s=\Omega(\sqrt{k})$, where $k$ is the min-entropy of
the shared secret weak random source. For larger $s$ the best known protocol
with optimal entropy loss in [Li15c] requires $O(s/\sqrt{k})$ rounds of
communication.
  In this paper we give an explicit non-malleable extractor that only requires
seed length and min-entropy $\log^{1+o(1)} (n/\epsilon)$, which also yields a
2-round privacy amplification protocol with optimal entropy loss for security
parameter up to $s=k^{1-\alpha}$ for any constant $\alpha>0$.
  For the third problem, previously the best known extractor which supports the
smallest min-entropy due to Li [Li13a], requires min-entropy $\log^{2+\delta}
n$ and uses $O(1/\delta)$ sources, for any constant $\delta>0$. A very recent
result by Cohen and Schulman [CS16] improves this, and constructed explicit
extractors that use $O(1/\delta)$ sources for min-entropy $\log^{1+\delta} n$,
any constant $\delta>0$. In this paper we further improve their result, and
give an explicit extractor that uses $O(1)$ (an absolute constant) sources for
min-entropy $\log^{1+o(1)} n$.

semiflexible polymer, in a shear flow, the strength of which is customarily
expressed in terms of the dimensionless Weissenberg number Wi. Polymer chains
in shear flows are well-known to undergo tumbling motion. When the chain
lengths are much smaller than the persistence length, one expects a
(semiflexible) chain to tumble as a rigid rod. At low Wi, a polymer segment
shorter than the persistence length does indeed tumble as a rigid rod. However,
for higher Wi the chain does not tumble as a rigid rod, even if the polymer
segment is shorter than the persistence length. In particular, from time to
time the polymer segment may assume a buckled form, a phenomenon commonly known
as Euler buckling. Using a bead-spring Hamiltonian model for extensible dsDNA
fragments, we first analyze Euler buckling in terms of the oriented
deterministic state (ODS), which is obtained as the steady-state solution of
the dynamical equations by turning off the stochastic (thermal) forces at a
fixed orientation of the chain. The ODS exhibits symmetry breaking at a
critical Weissenberg number Wi$_{\text c}$, analogous to a pitchfork
bifurcation in dynamical systems. We then follow up the analysis with
simulations and demonstrate symmetry breaking in computer experiments,
characterized by a unimodal to bimodal transformation of the probability
distribution of the second Rouse mode with increasing Wi. Our simulations
reveal that shear can cause strong deformation for a chain that is shorter than
its persistence length, similar to recent experimental observations.

and current densities for a massive fermionic field in (2+1)-dimensional
conical spacetime with a magnetic flux located at the cone apex. The
consideration is done for both irreducible representations of the Clifford
algebra. The expectation values are decomposed into the vacuum expectation
values and contributions coming from particles and antiparticles. All these
contributions are periodic functions of the magnetic flux with the period equal
to the flux quantum. Related to the non-invariance of the model under the
parity and time-reversal transformations, the fermion condensate and the charge
density have indefinite parity with respect to the change of the signs of the
magnetic flux and chemical potential. The expectation value of the radial
current density vanishes. The azimuthal current density is the same for both
the irreducible representations of the Clifford algebra. It is an odd function
of the magnetic flux and an even function of the chemical potential. The
behavior of the expectation values in various asymptotic regions of the
parameters are discussed in detail. In particular, we show that for points near
the cone apex the vacuum parts dominate. For a massless field with zero
chemical potential the fermion condensate and charge density vanish. Simple
expressions are derived for the part in the total charge induced by the planar
angle deficit and magnetic flux. Combining the results for separate irreducible
representations, we also consider the fermion condensate, charge and current
densities in parity and time-reversal symmetric models. Possible applications
to graphitic nanocones are discussed.

apparently the fragments of a cool core that has been completely stripped from

the clumps are still connected by the magnetic field lines. The observed
temperature variations imply that thermal conductivity is suppressed by a
factor >100 across the presumed direction of the magnetic field (as found in
other clusters), and is also suppressed -along- the field lines by a factor of
several. Two massive clumps in the periphery of A520, visible in the weak
lensing mass map and the X-ray image, have apparently been completely stripped

upon exit from the cluster. An X-ray hydrostatic mass estimate for one of the
clumps (that has simple geometry) agrees with the lensing mass. Its current gas
mass to total mass ratio is very low, 1.5-3%, which makes it a ""dark

in a region of an amplified magnetic field (with plasma $\beta\sim 10-20$). The

concave (which includes quasiconcave pdf), and has a finite first absolute

of uniform pdfs over hypercubes. Alice randomly selects a hypercube according
to its weight, encodes its position and size into $W$, and sends it to Bob who
generates $X$ uniformly over the hypercube. Compared to previous results on

evolution of the gravitational modification, we adopt the decaying mode of a

reproduce the standard cosmological background expansion history and due to the

embed the model in the effective field theory description of Horndeski

modification. Since the quasistatic approximation for the perturbations in the
model breaks down at high redshifts, where modifications remain relevant, we
introduce a computationally efficient correction to describe the evolution of
the scalar field fluctuation in this regime. We compare the decaying early-time
modification against geometric probes and recent Planck measurements and find
no evidence for such effects in the observations. Current data constrains the
scalar field value at $|f_{\mathcal{R}}(z=z_{\rm on})| \lesssim 10^{-2}$ for
modifications introduced at redshifts $z_{\rm on}\sim(500-1000)$ with

leptoquark boson S_1, which is a SU(3)_c triplet and SU(2)_L singlet particle
with -1/3 hypercharge interacting with a quark-lepton pair. With well-adjusted
couplings, this model can explain the anomaly and be compatible with all flavor

Hadron Collider (LHC) and subsequently decay as S_1 -> t tau, b nu, c tau. This
paper explores the current 8 and 13 TeV constraints, as well as the detailed
prospects at 14 TeV, of this flavor-motivated S_1 model. From the current
available 8 and 13 TeV LHC searches, we obtain constraints on the S_1 boson

Campaign 9 (K2C9) and $WFIRST$, facilitate measuring the masses and distances
of free-floating planet (FFP) candidates. FFPs are identified as single-lens
events with a short timescale, of-order 1 day. Measuring the mass of the
lensing object requires determining the finite size of the source star $\rho$,
as well as the microlens parallax $\pi_{\rm E}$. A planet that is bound to but
widely separated from a host star can produce a light curve similar to that of
an FFP. This tension can be resolved with high-resolution imaging of the
microlensing target to search for the lens flux $F_l$ from a possible host
star. Here we investigate the accessible parameter space for each of these
components --- $\pi_{\rm E}$, $\rho$, and $F_l$ --- considering different
satellites for a range of FFP masses, Galactic distances, and source star
properties. We find that at the beginning of K2C9, when its projected
separation from the Earth (as viewed from the center of its survey field) is
$\lesssim$0.2 AU, it will be able to measure $\pi_{\rm E}$ for Jupiter-mass FFP
candidates at distances larger than $\sim$2 kpc and to Earth-mass lenses at
$\sim$8 kpc. At the end of its campaign, when $D_\perp = 0.81$ AU, it is
sensitive to planetary-mass lenses for distances $\gtrsim$3.5 kpc, and even
then only to those with mass $\gtrsim$M$_{\rm Jup}$. From lens flux constraints
we find that it will be possible to exclude all stellar-mass host stars (down
to the deuterium-burning limit) for events within $\sim$2 kpc. Together these
indicate that the ability to characterize FFPs detected during K2C9 is
optimized for events occurring toward the beginning of the campaign. $WFIRST$,
on the other hand, will be able to detect and characterize FFPs with masses at
least as low as super-Earths throughout the Galaxy during its entire
microlensing survey.

Within this causal region, a maximin construction similar to that of Wall
proves that our proposed quantity satisfies standard properties of entanglement

effects in M dwarfs, such that lower mass and cooler dwarfs become bluer in the
IR color baseline. This diagnostic offers a new opportunity to model GC CMDs
and to reduce uncertainties on cluster properties (e.g., their derived ages).
In this context, we analyzed Hubble Space Telescope Wide Field Camera 3 IR
archival observations of four GCs - 47Tuc, M4, NGC2808, and NGC6752 - for which
the data are deep enough to fully sample the low-mass MS, reaching at least ~ 2

compared them with a grid of isochrones over a large range of parameter space,
allowing age, metallicity, distance, and reddening to vary within reasonable

factor of ${\sim} 3$ from the center to the outskirts that is consistent with
previous results for galaxy clusters. The metal abundance profile shows a flat
behavior towards large radii, which is a hint for galactic winds as the primary
ICM enrichment process. The entropy profile is consistent with numerical
simulations after applying a gas mass fraction correction. Previous analyses
for clusters and groups often showed an entropy flattening or even a drop
around ${\sim} R_{200}$, which can be an indication of clumping or
non-equilibrium states in the outskirts. Such entropy behavior is absent in
UGC03957. The gas mass fraction is well below the cosmic mean but rises above
this value beyond $R_{200}$, which could be a hint for deviations from
hydrostatic equilibrium at these large radii. We determined the relative number

examined using several astrophysical conditions. As the first-borbidden decay
is dominant in $N \sim 126$ neutron-rich nuclei, their inclusion shortens
$\beta$-decay lifetimes and shifts the abundance peak towards higher masses.
Additionally, the inclusion of the $\beta$-delayed neutron emission results in
a wider abundance peak, and smoothens the mass distribution by removing the
odd-even mass staggering. The effects are commonly seen in the results of all

example, the large scale equator-to-pole temperature gradient is maintained by
tropical heating, polar cooling, and a midlatitude meridional eddy heat flux
predominantly driven by baroclinically unstable weather systems. Based on basic
thermodynamic principles, it can be shown that the meridional heat flux, in
combination with the meridional temperature gradient, acts to maximize entropy
production of the atmosphere. In fact, maximum entropy production (MEP) has
been successfully used to explain the observed mean state of the atmosphere and
other components of the climate system. However, one important feature of the
large scale atmospheric circulation is its often non-Gaussian variability about
the mean. This paper presents theoretical and observational evidence that some
processes in the midlatitude atmosphere are significantly non-Gaussian to
maximize entropy production. First, after introducing the basic theory, it is
shown that the skewness of sea surface winds, damped by nonlinear surface drag,
are consistent with the MEP principle. Then it is pointed out that the observed
wavenumber spectrum of long planetary waves in the midlatitudes can be roughly
explained by maximizing the meridional eddy heat flux (and related entropy
production) of unstable baroclinic Eady waves. Finally observational evidence
is presented that the meridional eddy heat flux is increased by non-Gaussian
variability in meridional wind and temperatures anomalies.

from one brain state to another, in the process drawing on different cognitive

such transitions? Which features of this network contribute to making one
transition easy and another transition difficult? Here, we address these
questions using network control theory. We calculate the optimal input signals
to drive the brain to and from states dominated by different cognitive systems.
The input signals allow us to assess the contributions made by different brain
regions. We show that such contributions, which we measure as energy, are
correlated with regions' weighted degrees. We also show that the network
communicability, a measure of direct and indirect connectedness between brain
regions, predicts the extent to which brain regions compensate when input to
another region is suppressed. Finally, we identify optimal states in which the
brain should start (and finish) in order to minimize transition energy. We show
that the optimal target states display high activity in hub regions,
implicating the brain's rich club. Furthermore, when rich club organization is
destroyed, the energy cost associated with state transitions increases
significantly, demonstrating that it is the richness of brain regions that
makes them ideal targets.

round ball maximizes the volume under constraint on the product between

isoperimetric-isodiametric inequalities in Riemannian manifolds. We first prove
that the same inequality, with the sharp Euclidean constants, holds on
Cartan-Hadamard spaces as well as on minimal submanifolds of $\mathbb{R}^n$.
The equality cases are also studied and completely characterized; in
particular, the latter gives a new link with free boundary minimal submanifolds
in a Euclidean ball. We also consider the case of manifolds with non-negative
Ricci curvature and prove a new comparison result stating that metric balls in
the manifold have product of boundary area and radius bounded by the Euclidean
counterpart and equality holds if and only if the ball is actually Euclidean.
We then pass to consider the problem of the existence and the regularity of
optimal shapes (i.e. regions minimizing the product of boundary area and radius
under the constraint of having fixed enclosed volume), called here
isoperimetric-isodiametric regions. We give examples of spaces where there
exists no isoperimetric-isodiametric region and we prove that on the other hand
on compact spaces and on $C^0$-locally-asymptotic Euclidean manifolds with
non-negative Ricci curvature there exists an isoperimetric-isodiametric region
for every positive volume (this last class of spaces includes a large family of
metrics playing a key role in general relativity and Ricci flow: the so called
Hawking gravitational instantons and the Bryant-type Ricci solitons). We
finally prove that the boundary of the isoperimetric-isodiametric regions

systems improvement, but it is non-trivial to develop efficient statistical
methods due to two main challenges. First, profiles are high-dimensional
functional data with intrinsic inner- and inter-channel correlations, and one
needs to develop a dimension reduction method that can deal with such intricate
correlations for the purpose of effective monitoring. The second, and probably
more fundamental, challenge is that the functional structure of multi-channel
profiles might change over time, and thus the dimension reduction method should
be able to automatically take into account the potential unknown change. To
tackle these two challenges, we propose a novel thresholded multivariate
principal component analysis (PCA) method for multi-channel profile monitoring.
Our proposed method consists of two steps of dimension reduction: It first
applies the functional PCA to extract a reasonable large number of features
under the normal operational (in-control) state, and then use the
soft-thresholding techniques to further select significant features capturing
profile information in the out-of-control state. The choice of tuning parameter
for soft-thresholding is provided based on asymptotic analysis, and extensive
simulation studies are conducted to illustrate the efficacy of our proposed
thresholded PCA methodology.

decades. Established scaling laws relate fundamental quantities like the loop
apex temperature, pressure, length, and the coronal heating. Aims. We test such
scaling laws against a large-scale 3D MHD model of the Solar corona, which
became feasible with nowadays high-performance computing. Methods. We drive an
active region simulation a with photospheric observations and found strong
similarities to the observed coronal loops in X-rays and EUV wavelength. A 3D
reconstruction of stereoscopic observations showed that our model loops have a
realistic spatial structure. We compare scaling laws to our model data
extracted along an ensemble of field lines. Finally, we fit a new scaling law
that represents well hot loops and also cooler structures, which was not
possible before only based on observations. Results. Our model data gives some
support for scaling laws that were established for hot and EUV-emissive coronal
loops. For the RTV scaling law we find an offset to our model data, which can
be explained by 1D considerations of a static loop with a constant heat input
and conduction. With a fit to our model data we set up a new scaling law for
the coronal heat input along magnetic field lines. Conclusions. RTV-like
scaling laws were fitted to hot loops and therefore do not predict well the
coronal heat input for cooler structures that are hardly observable. The basic
differences between 1D and self-consistent 3D modeling account for deviations
between our and earlier scaling laws. We also conclude that a heating mechanism
by MHD-turbulent dissipation within a braided flux tube would heat the corona
stronger than consistent with our model corona.

Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) radiation. It is believed that the AME arises
from rotational emission by spinning polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) in
the interstellar medium (ISM). In this paper, we assume that a population of
ultrasmall silicate grains may exist in the ISM, and quantify rotational
emissivity from these tiny particles and its polarization spectrum. We found
that spinning silicate nanoparticles can produce strong rotational emission
when those small grains follow a log-normal size distribution. The polarization
fraction of spinning dust emission from tiny silicates increases with
decreasing the dipole moment per atom ($\beta$) and can reach $P\sim 20\%$ for
$\beta\sim 0.1$D at grain temperature of 60 K. We identify a parameter space
$(\beta,Y_{Si})$ for silicate nanoparticles in which its rotational emission
can adequately reproduce both the observed AME and the polarization of the AME,
without violating the observational constraints by the ultraviolet extinction
and polarization of starlight. Our results reveal that rotational emission from
spinning silicate may be an important source of the AME.

of the AGN power indicating that our template should be applicable to all
systems hosting luminous AGN (vLv(5100) or L_X(2-10keV) > 10^43.5 erg/s). We
note that for our sample of luminous QSOs, the average AGN emission is at least
as high as, and mostly higher than, the total stellar powered emission at all

hosting powerful AGN, there is no `safe' broadband photometric observation (at

subtracting the AGN contribution. Roughly, the AGN contribution may be ignored

function (IMF), as deduced observationally by Martin-Navarro et al. (2015c), on

the implied masses to be close to minimal, the inferred masses increase in both
the low- and high-metallicity regimes due to the addition of stellar remnants
and dwarf stars, respectively. The resulting galaxy stellar mass function
(GSMF) shifts toward higher masses by 0.5 dex, without affecting the high-mass
slope (and thus the need for effective quenching). The implied low-redshift SFR
density increases by an order of magnitude. However, these results depend
strongly on the assumed IMF parametrisation, which is not directly constrained
by the observations. Varying the low-end IMF slope instead of the high-end IMF
slope, while maintaining the same dwarf-to-giant ratio, results in a much more
modest GSMF shift of 0.2 dex and a 10 per cent increase in the SFR density

bimodality in the galaxy population by on the one hand making galaxies less

reducing the gas consumption timescale. We conclude that the implications of

an electronic pairing glue in the cuprates, where superconductivity is mediated
by collective bosonic excitations of the electron fluid. In other materials,
most importantly iron based systems with only hole or only electron pockets,
the microscopic origin is hotly debated. Scanning tunneling microscopy (STM)
has been shown to be a powerful experimental probe to detect electronic
excitations and further allows to deduce some fingerprints of bosonic
collective modes. Here, we demonstrate that the inclusion of inelastic tunnel
events is crucial for the interpretation of tunneling spectra and allows to
directly probe bosonic excitations via STM. We develop a model describing both
the elastic tunneling current, which displays the electronic spectral function,
and the inelastic current, that contains the information about the bosonic
spectrum, in the superconducting state. Adopting this extended tunneling
formalism we can naturally reproduce the tunneling spectra of various
unconventional superconductors and trace the occurring features back to an
opening of a spin gap in the superconducting state. More generally, our
approach is a strong argument in favour of a collective mode mediating the
pairing state in particular in iron-based systems. In particular, we conclude
that the debated pairing mechanism in LiFeSe is also of electronic origin with
sign-changing pairing symmetry.

order in the non-equilibrium expansion parameter. The first prescription is
based on a generalisation of the kinetic mesoscopic virial equation and
expresses the pressure exerted on the walls in terms of the average of the
virial of the inter-particle forces. In the second approach, the pressure and
the surface tension are identified with the volume and area derivatives,
respectively, of the partition function associated with the known stationary
non-equilibrium distribution of the model. The third method is a mechanical
approach and is related to the work necessary to deform the system. The
pressure is obtained by comparing the expression of the work in terms of local
stress and strain with the corresponding expression in terms of microscopic
distribution. This is determined from the force balance encoded in the
Born-Green-Yvon equation. Such a method has the advantage of giving a formula
for the local pressure tensor and the surface tension even in inhomogeneous
situations. By direct inspection, we show that the three procedures lead to the

noise is weakly obscuring these clusters, i.e, the between-cluster edges are
assigned very small weights, then we can recover significantly smaller
clusters. For example, we show that in approximately sparse graphs, where the
between-cluster weights tend to zero as the size n of the graph tends to
infinity, we can recover clusters of size polylogarithmic in n. Empirical
evidence from numerical simulations is also provided to support these
theoretical phase transitions to perfect recovery of the cluster structure.

oblate envelopes of rapidly-rotating solar-type stars. This has been achieved
by exploiting the capabilities of the new Compressible High-ORder Unstructured
Spectral difference (CHORUS) code. We consider rotation rates up to 85\% of the
critical (breakup) rotation rate, which yields an equatorial radius that is up
to 17\% larger than the polar radius. This substantial oblateness enhances the
disparity between polar and equatorial modes of convection. We find that the
convection redistributes the heat flux emitted from the outer surface, leading
to an enhancement of the heat flux in the polar and equatorial regions. This
finding implies that lower-mass stars with convective envelopes may not have
darker equators as predicted by classical gravity darkening arguments. The
vigorous high-latitude convection also establishes elongated axisymmetric
circulation cells and zonal jets in the polar regions. Though the overall
amplitude of the surface differential rotation, $\Delta \Omega$, is insensitive
to the oblateness, the oblateness does limit the fractional kinetic energy
contained in the differential rotation to no more than 61\%. Furthermore, we
argue that this level of differential rotation is not enough to have a
significant impact on the oblateness of the star.

provided by imposing the identity between two probability density functions

method with respect to previous approaches such as the scaling limit of the

is then shown that, in the symmetric case, a stochastic solution can be
obtained by a Gaussian process with stationary increments and with a random

Therefore, an efficient SAT solver to enhance the performance is always
desired. We propose a hardware acceleration method for SAT problems. By
surveying the properties of SAT problems and the decoding of low-density

discover that both of them are constraint satisfaction problems. The belief

electrical stimuli to coordinate each heart beat. Abnormalities in the heart's
electrical behaviour can be managed with a cardiac pacemaker. Recently, the
closed-loop testing of pacemakers with an emulation (real-time simulation) of

reactions to the pacemaker as if it were a real heart. This enables developers
to interrogate their pacemaker design without having to engage in costly or
lengthy clinical trials. Many high-fidelity heart models have been developed,
but are too computationally intensive to be simulated in real-time. Heart
models, designed specifically for the closed-loop testing of pacemakers, are
too abstract to be useful in the testing of physical pacemakers.
  In the context of pacemaker testing, this paper presents a more
computationally efficient heart model that generates realistic continuous-time
electrical signals. The heart model is composed of cardiac cells that are
connected by paths. Significant improvements were made to an existing cardiac
cell model to stabilise its activation behaviour and to an existing path model
to capture the behaviour of continuous electrical propagation. We provide

following arguments of Cantor and Brill in the compact case, we show that given
an asymptotically flat metric $g$, there is a conformally equivalent
asymptotically flat scalar-flat metric that agrees with $g$ on the boundary. We
then replace the metric boundary condition with a condition on the mean

that there is an asymptotically flat scalar-flat metric, conformally equivalent

grazing cattle and investigate their spatiotemporal patterns using a simple
two-state `stop-and-move' mobility model. We find that the dispersal kernel in
the moving state is best described by a mixture exponential distribution,
indicating the hierarchical nature of the movement. On the other hand, the
waiting time appears to be scale-invariant below a certain cut-off and is best
described by a truncated power-law distribution, suggesting heterogenous
dynamics in the non-moving state. We explore possible explanations for the
observed phenomena, covering factors that can play a role in the generation of
mobility patterns, such as the context of grazing environment, the intrinsic
decision-making mechanism or the energy status of different activities. In
particular, we propose a new hypothesis that the underlying movement pattern
can be attributed to the most probable observable energy status under the
maximum entropy configuration. These results are not only valuable for
modelling cattle movement but also provide new insights for understanding the

constructing some novel spaces to model the background and redefine the
distance of the salient patches away from the background. Concretely, given the
backgroundness prior, eigendecomposition is utilized to create four spaces of
background-based distribution (SBD) to model the background, in which a more
appropriate metric (Mahalanobis distance) is quoted to delicately measure the
saliency of every image patch away from the background. After that, a coarse
saliency map is obtained by integrating the four adjusted Mahalanobis distance
maps, each of which is formed by the distances between all the patches and
background in the corresponding SBD. To be more discriminative, the coarse
saliency map is further enhanced into the posterior probability map within
Bayesian perspective. Finally, the final saliency map is generated by properly
refining the posterior probability map with geodesic distance. Experimental
results on two usual datasets show that the proposed method is effective

from the nodes of the network to the analysis center without revealing
individual-level microdata and can be used very easily with standard softwares
for estimation of disease odds ratio associated with a set of categorical or
continuous covariates. Microaggregation of covariates allows for consistent
estimation of the parameters of logistic regression model that can include
confounders and transformation of exposure. Additionally, since the microdata
can be accessed within nodes, effect modifiers can be accommodated and
consistently estimated. For analysis of confidential health data, covariate
microaggregation for logistic regression will provide a practical and

increasingly important. Measurements within and across brain structures,
demonstrating the occurrence of bursts of beta/gamma oscillations only during
one specific phase of each theta/alpha cycle, have motivated the need to
advance beyond linear and stationary time series models. Here we offer a novel
measure, namely, the ""dual frequency RV-coupling coefficient"", for assessing
different types of frequency-frequency interactions that subserve information
flow in the brain. This is a measure of coherence between two complex-valued
vectors, consisting of the set of Fourier coefficients for two different
frequency bands, within or across two brain regions. RV-coupling is expressed
in terms of instantaneous and lagged components. Furthermore, by using
normalized Fourier coefficients (unit modulus), phase-type couplings can also
be measured. The dual frequency RV-coupling coefficient is based on previous
work: the second order bispectrum, i.e. the dual-frequency coherence (Thomson
1982; Haykin & Thomson 1998); the RV-coefficient (Escoufier 1973); Gorrostieta
et al (2012); and Pascual-Marqui et al (2011). This paper presents the new
measure, and outlines relevant statistical tests. The novel aspects of the
""dual frequency RV-coupling coefficient"" are: (1) it can be applied to two
multivariate time series; (2) the method is not limited to single discrete
frequencies, and in addition, the frequency bands are treated by means of
appropriate multivariate statistical methodology; (3) the method makes use of a
novel generalization of the RV-coefficient for complex-valued multivariate
data; (4) real and imaginary covariance contributions to the RV-coherence are
obtained, allowing the definition of a ""lagged-coupling"" measure that is
minimally affected by the low spatial resolution of estimated cortical electric
neuronal activity.

sketches. An $\varepsilon$ approximate quantile sketch receives a stream of
items $x_1,\ldots,x_n$ and allows one to approximate the rank of any query up
to additive error $\varepsilon n$ with probability at least $1-\delta$. The
rank of a query $x$ is the number of stream items such that $x_i \le x$. The
minimal sketch size required for this task is trivially at least
$1/\varepsilon$. Felber and Ostrovsky obtain a
$O((1/\varepsilon)\log(1/\varepsilon))$ space sketch for a fixed $\delta$. To
date, no better upper or lower bounds were known even for randomly permuted
streams or for approximating a specific quantile, e.g.,\ the median. This paper
obtains an $O((1/\varepsilon)\log \log (1/\delta))$ space sketch and a matching
lower bound. This resolves the open problem and proves a qualitative gap
between randomized and deterministic quantile sketching. One of our
contributions is a novel representation and modification of the widely used
merge-and-reduce construction. This subtle modification allows for an analysis
which is both tight and extremely simple. Similar techniques should be useful
for improving other sketching objectives and geometric coreset constructions.

range such as biological systems and electrical power grids. Some important
features of these systems were successfully studied and understood through
simplified model of linear interconnection of linear subsystems, where provably
global properties, e.g. global convergence to a specific state, usually hold
true. However, in severely disturbed conditions many of those systems exhibit
strongly nonlinear behaviour. Particularly, multiple equilibrium points may
coexist and make the dynamical behavior of the system difficult to predict.
Aiming at understanding the fragility of interconnected systems, we will
provide a hierarchical framework to assess the metastability and resilience of
such systems. This framework is based on independently characterizing stability
of individual subsystems when they are uncoupled from the network, and then
enforcing the diagonal dominance property on a structure matrix capturing the
subsystems stability and the input-to-output gains of interconnection network.
Since the subsystems are usually of low order and the structure matrix has size
equal to the number of subsystems, this framework is easy to implement and thus
scalable to large scale interconnected systems. Possible application of this
framework in assessing stability of microgrids will be discussed at the end of
this paper.

  First, we show any game (not just projection games) can be fortified, and
give a simple proof of parallel repetition for general fortified games. Then,
we prove parallel repetition and fortification theorems for games with players
sharing quantum entanglement, as well as games with more than two players. This
gives a new gap amplification method for general games in the quantum and
multiplayer settings, which has recently received much interest.
  An important component of our work is a variant of the fortification
transformation, called ""ordered fortification"", that preserves the entangled
value of a game. The original fortification of Moshkovitz does not in general
preserve the entangled value of a game, and this was a barrier to extending the

the wide spread use of GPS-enabled devices, many applications assign a spatial
attribute to graph vertices (e.g., geo-tagged social media). Users may issue a
Reachability Query with Spatial Range Predicate (abbr. RangeReach). RangeReach
finds whether an input vertex can reach any spatial vertex that lies within an
input spatial range. An example of a RangeReach query is: Given a social graph,
find whether Alice can reach any of the venues located within the geographical
area of Arizona State University. The paper proposes GeoReach an approach that
adds spatial data awareness to a graph database management system (GDBMS).
GeoReach allows efficient execution of RangeReach queries, yet without
compromising a lot on the overall system scalability (measured in terms of
storage size and initialization/maintenance time). To achieve that, GeoReach is
equipped with a light-weight data structure, namely SPA-Graph, that augments
the underlying graph data with spatial indexing directories. When a RangeReach
query is issued, the system employs a pruned-graph traversal approach.
Experiments based on real system implementation inside Neo4j proves that
GEOREACH exhibits up to two orders of magnitude better query response time and
up to four times less storage than the state-of-the-art spatial and

  in OFDM Full-Duplex Systems",,,,,"cs.IT math.IT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In full-duplex systems, oscillator phase noise (PN) problem is considered the
bottleneck challenge that may face the self-interference cancellation (SIC)
stage especially when orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM)
transmission scheme is deployed. Phase noise degrades the SIC performance
significantly, if not mitigated before or during the SIC technique. The
presence of the oscillator phase noise has different impacts on the transmitted
data symbol like common phase error (CPE) and inter-carrier interference (ICI).
However, phase noise can be estimated and mitigated digitally in either time or
frequency domain. Through this work, we propose a novel and simple time domain
self-interference (SI) phase noise estimation and mitigation technique. The
proposed algorithm is inspired from Wiener filtering in time domain. Simulation
results show that the proposed algorithm has a superior performance than the
already-existing time-domain or frequency domain PN mitigation solutions with a
noticeable reduction in the computational complexity.

the nugget effect, on account of multi-streaming of the velocity field. We find
that the performance is indeed improved. For sparsely sampled data

The scale of reliable measurement of the velocity power spectrum is extended by
a factor $\sim 1.6$, and 2) the dependence on the velocity correlation prior is
weakened by a factor of $\sim 2$. We conclude that such extensions are
desirable for accurate velocity assignment by Kriging.

the configuration space of a free particle (or the center of mass of a closed

constructed as a representation space for the relativity symmetry. From the
corresponding quantum symmetry, we illustrate the construction of a quantum
configuration space, similar to that of quantum phase space, and recover the

In this work, we present a rigorous ghost interaction correction (GIC) scheme

decomposition of the ensemble short-range exchange-correlation energy into a
multideterminantal exact exchange term, which involves the long-range
interacting ensemble density matrix instead of the Kohn--Sham (KS) one, and a
complementary density-functional correlation energy. A generalized adiabatic
connection formula is derived for the latter. In order to perform practical
calculations, the complementary correlation functional has been simply modeled
by its ground-state local density approximation (LDA) while long-range
interacting ground- and excited-state wavefunctions have been obtained
self-consistently by combining a long-range configuration interaction
calculation with a short-range LDA potential. We show that GIC reduces the
curvature of approximate range-separated ensemble energies drastically while
providing considerably more accurate excitation energies, even for
charge-transfer and double excitations. Interestingly, the method performs well
also in the context of standard KS-eDFT, which is recovered when the
range-separation parameter is set to zero.

adjoint free scalar field theory. Compared to the vector models, the set of
single trace operators is immensely extended so that the corresponding AdS
theory also contains infinitely many massive higher spin fields on top of the
massless ones. We compute the one-loop vacuum energy of these AdS fields to
test this duality at the subleading order in large $N$ expansion. The
determination of the bulk vacuum energy requires a proper scheme to sum up the
infinitely many contributions. For that, we develop a new method and apply it
first to calculate the vacuum energies for the first few `Regge trajectories'
in AdS$_4$ and AdS$_5$. In considering the full vacuum energy of AdS theory
dual to a matrix model CFT, we find that there exist more than one available
prescriptions for the one-loop vacuum energy. Taking a particular prescription,
we determine the full vacuum energy of the AdS$_5$ theory, whereas the AdS$_4$
calculation still remains technically prohibitive. This result shows that the
full vacuum energy of the AdS$_5$ theory coincides with minus of the free
energy of a single scalar field on the boundary. This is analogous to the
$O(N)$ vector model case, hence suggests an interpretation of the
\emph{positive} shift of the bulk coupling constant, i.e. from $N^2-1$ to

resonance contains a large meson-baryon component, which can vary depending on
the specific formalism. In this work, we examine such a picture by utilizing
the compositeness condition and the large number of colors ($N_c$) expansion.
We examine three different models fulfilling two body unitarity in
coupled-channels, and adopting renormalization schemes where the mass of the
$\Lambda_c(2595)$ resonance is well described, but not necessarily its width,
since we do not consider three body channels and work at the isospin symmetric
limit. Both approximations might have an effect larger on the width than on the
mass. In this context, our studies show that the compositeness of the
$\Lambda_c(2595)$ depends on the number of considered coupled channels, and on
the particular regularization scheme adopted in the unitary approaches and,
therefore, is model dependent. In addition, we perform an exploratory study of
the $\Lambda_c(2595)$ in the large $N_c$ expansion, within a scheme involving
only the $\pi\Sigma_c$ and $K\Xi'_c$ channels, whose dynamics is mostly fixed
by chiral symmetry. In this context and formulating the leading-order
interaction as a function of $N_c$, we show that for moderate $N_c> 3$ values,
the mass and width of the $\Lambda_c(2595)$ deviate from those of a genuine
$qqq$ baryon, implying the relevance of meson-baryon components in its wave
function. Furthermore, we study the properties of the $\Lambda_c(2595)$, in the
strict $N_c \to \infty $ limit, using an extension of the chiral
Weinberg-Tomozawa interaction to an arbitrary number of flavors and colors.
This latter study hints at the possible existence of a (perhaps) sub-dominant
$qqq$ component in the $\Lambda_c(2595)$ resonance wave function, which would
become dominant when the number of colors gets sufficiently large.

observational data and empirical analysis, we will demonstrate how to utilize
the double logarithmic linear regression to evaluate multifractal parameters.
The OLS regression analysis has two different approaches. One is to fix the

the advisable method is to constrain the intercept to zero. The zero-intercept
regression yields proper multifractal parameter spectrums within certain scale
range of moment order, while the common regression results are not normal. In
practice, the zero-intercept regression and the common regression can be
combined to calculate multifractal parameters. Comparing the two sets of
results, we can judge when and where multifractal urban structure appears. This
research will inspire urban scientists to employ a proper technique to estimate
multifractal dimensions for urban scientific studies.

from the chromosphere, condenses into the prominence in the corona, and drains
back to the chromosphere, establishing a stable chromosphere-corona plasma

communication between three users connected through a generalized multiple
access channel (MAC). While two users control the channel inputs, all three
users observe noisy outputs from the channel and each pair of users wishes to
agree on a secret key hidden from the remaining user. We first develop a
""pre-generated"" key-agreement scheme based on secrecy codes for the generalized
MAC, in which the channel is only used to distribute pre-generated secret keys.
We then extend this scheme to include an additional layer of rate-limited
secret-key generation by treating the observed channel outputs as induced
sources. We characterize inner and outer bounds on the strong secret-key
capacity region for both schemes. For a special case of the ""pre-generated""
scheme, we obtain an exact characterization. We also illustrate with some
binary examples that exploiting the generalized nature of the generalized MAC
may lead to significantly larger key-agreement rates.

considered to be the reservoir of baryonic matter persistently fueling the star
formation in the disk. Because of its proximity, M31 is the ideal object for
studying the structure of the halo gas in great detail. Using the latest
neutral atomic hydrogen (HI) data of the Effelsberg-Bonn HI Survey (EBHIS)
allows comprising a comprehensive inventory of gas associated with M31. The
primary aim is to differentiate between physical structures belonging to the
Milky Way Galaxy and M31 and accordingly to test the presence of a M31 neutral
gaseous halo. Analyzing the spatially fully sampled EBHIS data makes it
feasible to trace coherent HI structures in space and radial velocity. To
disentangle Milky Way and M31 HI emission we use a new approach, along with the
traditional path of setting an upper radial velocity limit, by calculating a
difference second moment map. We argue that M31's disk is physically connected
to an asymmetric HI halo of tens of kpc size, the M31 cloud. We confirm the
presence of a coherent low-velocity HI filament located in between M31 and M33
aligned at the sky with the clouds at systemic velocity. The physical
parameters of the HI filament are comparable to those of the HI clouds at
systemic velocity. We also detected an irregularly shaped HI cloud that is is
positionally located close to but offset from the stellar body of And XIX.

crucial information on how gas moves through galaxies, especially in mergers

12CO, 13CO and C18O1-0 high-sensitivity ALMA observations were used to assess
properties of the large-scale molecular gas reservoir and its connection to the
circumnuclear molecular ring in NGC1614. The role of excitation and abundances
were studied in this context. Spatial distributions of the 12CO and 13CO
emission show significant differences. 12CO traces the large-scale molecular
gas reservoir, associated with a dust lane that harbors infalling gas. 13CO
emission is - for the first time - detected in the large-scale dust lane. Its
emission peaks between dust lane and circumnuclear molecular ring. A
12CO-to-13CO1-0 intensity ratio map shows high values in the ring region (~30)
typical for the centers of luminous galaxy mergers and even more extreme values
in the dust lane (>45). This drop in ratio is consistent with molecular gas in
the dust lane being in a diffuse, unbound state while being funneled towards
the nucleus. We find a high 16O-to-18O abundance ratio in the starburst region
(>900), typical of quiescent disk gas - by now, the starburst is expected to
have enriched the nuclear ISM in 18O relative to 16O. The massive inflow of gas
may be partially responsible for the low 18O/16O abundance since it will dilute
the starburst enrichment with unprocessed gas from greater radii. The
12CO-to-13CO abundance is consistent with this scenario. It suggests that the
nucleus of NGC1614 is in a transient phase of evolution where starburst and
nuclear growth are fuelled by returning gas from the minor merger event.

qualitatively correct but that with DFT using the PBE functional is not. This
is specific to the modeling of large molecules where the HOMO is close to the

\citet{2016arXiv160304342L}, we proposed a measure called gravitational energy
spectrum to quantify the importance of gravity on multiple physical scales. In
this work, using a wavelet-based decomposition technique, we derive the
gravitational energy spectra of the Orion A and the Orion B molecular cloud
from observational data. The gravitational energy spectra exhibit
power-law-like behaviours. From a few pc down to $\sim 0.1 $ pc scale, the
Orion A and Orion B molecular cloud have $E_{\rm p}(k)\sim k^{-1.88}$ and
$E_{\rm p}(k)\sim k^{-2.09}$, respectively. These scaling exponents are close
to the scaling exponents of the kinetic energy power spectrum of compressible
turbulence (where $E\sim k^{-2}$), with a near-equipartition of turbulent
versus gravitational energy on multiple scales. This provides a clear evidence
that gravity is able to counteract effectively against turbulent motion for
these length scales. The results confirm our earlier analytical estimates. For
the Orion A molecular cloud, gravity inevitably dominates over turbulence
inside the cloud. Our results provide a clear observational proof that gravity
is playing a determining role in the evolution these molecular clouds from the
cloud scale down to $\sim 0.1\;\rm pc$. { However, turbulence is likely to

monoxide (CO), ethylene (C$_2$H$_4$), hydrogen cyanide (HCN), methane (CH$_4$),
molecular nitrogen (N$_2$) and water (H$_2$O). By considering only the gas
phase, we prove that the mixing ratio of carbon monoxide is governed by a decic
equation (polynomial equation of degree 10). We validate our solutions against
numerical calculations of equilibrium chemistry that perform Gibbs free energy
minimization and demonstrate that they are accurate at the $\sim 1\%$ level for
temperatures from 500 to 3000 K. In hydrogen-dominated atmospheres, the ratio
of abundances of HCN to CH$_4$ is nearly constant across a wide range of
carbon-to-oxygen ratios, which makes it a robust diagnostic of the metallicity
in the gas phase. Our validated formulae allow for the convenient benchmarking
of chemical kinetics codes and provide an efficient way of enforcing chemical

that $r \subseteq s$. Besides being a basic operator in all modern data
management systems with a wide range of applications, the join can be used to
evaluate complex SQL queries based on relational division and as a module of
data mining algorithms. The state-of-the-art algorithm for set containment
joins (PRETTI) builds an inverted index on the right-hand collection $S$ and a
prefix tree on the left-hand collection $R$ that groups set objects with common
prefixes and thus, avoids redundant processing. In this paper, we present a
framework which improves PRETTI in two directions. First, we limit the prefix
tree construction by proposing an adaptive methodology based on a cost model;
this way, we can greatly reduce the space and time cost of the join. Second, we
partition the objects of each collection based on their first contained item,
assuming that the set objects are internally sorted. We show that we can
process the partitions and evaluate the join while building the prefix tree and
the inverted index progressively. This allows us to significantly reduce not
only the join cost, but also the maximum memory requirements during the join.
An experimental evaluation using both real and synthetic datasets shows that
our framework outperforms PRETTI by a wide margin.

Waiter. The game ends when all the edges have been claimed. If Client's graph

corresponding Waiter-Client games and with the probabilistic intuition. For the

problem and has been successfully used for formant and monopitch estimation. In
this paper, modified group delay functions are used for multipitch estimation
in concurrent speech. The power spectrum of the speech is first flattened in
order to annihilate the system characteristics, while retaining the source
characteristics. Group delay analysis on this flattened spectrum picks the
predominant pitch in the first pass and a comb filter is used to filter out the
estimated pitch along with its harmonics. The residual spectrum is again
analyzed for the next candidate pitch estimate in the second pass. The final
pitch trajectories of the constituent speech utterances are formed using pitch

time-dependent power spectrum $\left\langle S_{t_m}(\omega)\right\rangle$ where
$t_m$ is the measurement time. For processes with an aging correlation function
of the form $\left\langle I(t)I(t+\tau)\right\rangle=t^{\Upsilon}\phi_{\rm
EA}(\tau/t)$, where $\phi_{\rm EA}(x)$ is a nonanalytic function when $x$ is
small, we find aging $1/f$ noise. Aging $1/f$ noise is characterized by five
critical exponents. We derive the relations between the scaled correlation
function and these exponents. We show that our definition of the time-dependent
spectrum retains its interpretation as a density of Fourier modes and discuss
the relation to the apparent infrared divergence of $1/f$ noise. We illustrate
our results for blinking quantum dot models, single-file diffusion and Brownian
motion in logarithmic potential.

field-of-view-limited astronomical observatories such as Imaging Atmospheric
Cherenkov Telescopes (IACTs). In this work, we address two questions relevant
for the observation of sources characterized by AGN-like variability: what is
the most time-efficient way to detect such sources, and what is the
observational bias that can be introduced by the choice of the observing
strategy when conducting blind surveys of the sky. Different observing
strategies are evaluated using simulated light curves and realistic instrument
response functions of the Cherenkov Telescope Array (CTA), a future gamma-ray
observatory. We show that strategies that makes use of very small observing
windows, spread over large periods of time, allows for a faster detection of
the source, and are less influenced by the variability properties of the
sources, as compared to strategies that concentrate the observing time in a
small number of large observing windows. Although derived using CTA as an
example, our conclusions are conceptually valid for any IACTs facility, and in
general, to all observatories with small field of view and limited duty cycle.

model. In our work we have suggested that there are several other (physically
motivated) interesting limits -- located at least thirty orders of magnitude
before the Planck time -- where the physical basis of the cosmological model
and its time concept is progressively weakened. Some of these limits are
connected to phase transitions in the early universe which gradually undermine
the notion of 'standard clocks' widely employed in cosmology. Such
considerations lead to a 'scale problem' for time which becomes particularly
acute above the electroweak phase transition (before $\sim 10^{-11}$ seconds).
Other limits are due to problems of building up a cosmological reference frame,
or even contemplating a sensible notion of proper time, if the early universe
constituents become too quantum. This 'quantum problem' for time arises e.g. if
a pure quantum phase is contemplated at the beginning of inflation at, say,
$\sim 10^{-34}$ seconds.

destabilizing modes vary with a singular rate, whereas NPMs' exhibit no such
singularity. As a result, NPMs converge much earlier than destabilizing

Anonymous Dynamic Networks do not provide enough guarantees to be used in
practice. Indeed, they either compute only an upper bound on the network size
that may be as bad as exponential, or guarantee only double-exponential running

correct count. Recently, we presented the first Counting protocol that computes
the exact count with exponential running-time guarantees. The protocol requires
the presence of one leader node and knowledge of any upper bound Delta on the
maximum number of neighbors that any node will ever have. In the present work,
we complement the latter theoretical study evaluating the performance of such

which are related to the central range, are asymptotically strictly larger than
zero, all local levels of HC tests converge to zero as the sample size

attackers such as those capable of seamlessly taking over a GPS receiver, which
is currently receiving legitimate satellite signals, and spoofing them to an
arbitrary location. Also, there is no hardware platform that can be used to
compare and evaluate the effectiveness of existing countermeasures in
real-world scenarios. In this work, we present SPREE, which is, to the best of
our knowledge, the first GPS receiver capable of detecting all spoofing attacks
described in literature. Our novel spoofing detection technique called
auxiliary peak tracking enables detection of even a strong attacker capable of
executing the seamless takeover attack. We implement and evaluate our receiver
against three different sets of GPS signal traces and show that SPREE
constrains even a strong attacker (capable of seamless takeover attack) from
spoofing the receiver to a location not more than 1 km away from its true
location. This is a significant improvement over modern GPS receivers that can
be spoofed to any arbitrary location. Finally, we release our implementation
and datasets to the community for further research and development.

peripheral countries, while only being in the core and not trading with

success or failure of an emerging economy. We validate our methodology on

composed of two modules. The feature embedding module is a deep Convolutional
Neural Network (CNN) which maps each face image to a feature vector. The
aggregation module consists of two attention blocks which adaptively aggregate
the feature vectors to form a single feature inside the convex hull spanned by
them. Due to the attention mechanism, the aggregation is invariant to the image
order. Our NAN is trained with a standard classification or verification loss
without any extra supervision signal, and we found that it automatically learns
to advocate high-quality face images while repelling low-quality ones such as
blurred, occluded and improperly exposed faces. The experiments on IJB-A,

using neutral strange baryons ($\Lambda$, $\bar{\Lambda}$) and mesons ($K^0_S$)
at intermediate transverse momentum (3 $<$ $p_T$ $<$ 6 GeV/$c$) to look for
possible flavor and baryon/meson dependence. This study is performed in $d$+Au,
Cu+Cu and Au+Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_{{NN}}}$ = 200 GeV measured by the STAR
experiment at RHIC. The near-side di-hadron correlation contains two
structures, a peak which is narrow in azimuth and pseudorapidity consistent
with correlations due to jet fragmentation, and a correlation in azimuth which
is broad in pseudorapidity. The particle composition of the jet-like
correlation is determined using identified associated particles. The dependence
of the conditional yield of the jet-like correlation on the trigger particle
momentum, associated particle momentum, and centrality for correlations with
unidentified trigger particles are presented. The neutral strange particle
composition in jet-like correlations with unidentified charged particle
triggers is not well described by PYTHIA. However, the yield of unidentified

performing type inference over stripped machine code is called type
reconstruction, and offers a useful capability in support of reverse
engineering and decompilation.
  In this paper, we motivate and develop a novel type system and algorithm for
machine-code type inference. The features of this type system were developed by
surveying a wide collection of common source- and machine-code idioms, building
a catalog of challenging cases for type reconstruction. We found that these
idioms place a sophisticated set of requirements on the type system, inducing
features such as recursively-constrained polymorphic types. Many of the
features we identify are often seen only in expressive and powerful type
systems used by high-level functional languages.
  Using these type-system features as a guideline, we have developed Retypd: a
novel static type-inference algorithm for machine code that supports recursive
types, polymorphism, and subtyping. Retypd yields more accurate inferred types
than existing algorithms, while also enabling new capabilities such as
reconstruction of pointer const annotations with 98% recall. Retypd can operate
on weaker program representations than the current state of the art, removing
the need for high-quality points-to information that may be impractical to

self-assemble to form a symmetric protein shell called a capsid. This assembly
process is subject to multiple competing constraints, including the need to
form a thermostable shell while avoiding kinetic traps. It has been proposed
that viral assembly satisfies these constraints through allosteric regulation,
including the interconversion of capsid proteins among conformations with
different propensities for assembly. In this article we use computational and
theoretical modeling to explore how such allostery affects the assembly of
icosahedral shells. We simulate assembly under a wide range of protein
concentrations, protein binding affinities, and two different mechanisms of
allosteric control. We find that, above a threshold strength of allosteric
control, assembly becomes robust over a broad range of subunit binding
affinities and concentrations, allowing the formation of highly thermostable
capsids. Our results suggest that allostery can significantly shift the range
of protein binding affinities that lead to successful assembly, and thus should

vehicle is coupled solely to its immediate predecessor and to its immediate
follower with different gains in these two directions. We show that in this
setting, unlike with unidirectional or symmetric bidirectional controllers,
string stability can be recovered when disturbances act only on a small
($N$-independent) set of leading vehicles. This improves existing results from
the literature with this assumption. We also indicate that string stability
with respect to arbitrarily distributed disturbances cannot be achieved with
this controller.

graph $G$ and a collection $M=\{(s_1,t_1),\ldots,(s_k,t_k)\}$ of pairs of
vertices of $G$ called demand pairs, find a maximum-cardinality set of
node-disjoint paths connecting the demand pairs. NDP is one of the most basic
routing problems, that has been studied extensively. Despite this, there are
still wide gaps in our understanding of its approximability: the best currently
known upper bound of $O(\sqrt n)$ on its approximation ratio is achieved via a
simple greedy algorithm, while the best current negative result shows that the
problem does not have a better than $\Omega(\log^{1/2-\delta}n)$-approximation
for any constant $\delta$, under standard complexity assumptions. Even for
planar graphs no better approximation algorithms are known, and to the best of
our knowledge, the best negative bound is APX-hardness. Perhaps the biggest
obstacle to obtaining better approximation algorithms for NDP is that most
currently known approximation algorithms for this type of problems rely on the
standard multicommodity flow relaxation, whose integrality gap is $\Omega(\sqrt
n)$ for NDP, even in planar graphs. In this paper, we break the barrier of
$O(\sqrt n)$ on the approximability of the NDP problem in planar graphs and
obtain an $\tilde O(n^{9/19})$-approximation. We introduce a new linear

very demanding task due to the large spatial excursions and drifts of electrons
in intense laser fields. The time-dependent surface flux (t-SURFF) method for
the calculation of PES [L. Tao, A. Scrinzi, New Journal of Physics 14, 013021

present an implementation of the t-SURFF method in the well established
TDSE-solver Qprop [D. Bauer, P. Koval, Comput. Phys. Commun. 174, 396 (2006)].
Qprop efficiently propagates wavefunctions for single-active electron systems
with spherically symmetric binding potentials in classical, linearly (along
$z$) or elliptically (in the $xy$-plane) polarized laser fields in dipole
approximation. Its combination with t-SURFF makes the simulation of PES
feasible in cases where it is just too expensive to keep the entire

used to model the relevant transport of particles used e.g. in dose calculation
in radiation therapy. The evolution of charged particles (e.g. electrons and
positrons) are in practice often modelled using the CSDA version of BTE because
of the so-called forward peakedness of scattering events contributing to the
particle fluencies (or particle densities), which causes severe problems in
numerical methods. We shall find, after the preliminary treatments, that for
some interactions CSDA-type modelling is actually necessary due to
hyper-singularities in the differential cross-sections of certain interactions,
that is, first or second order partial derivatives with respect to energy and
angle must be included into the transport part of charged particles. The
existence and uniqueness of (weak) solutions is shown, under sufficient
criteria and in appropriate $L^2$-based spaces, for a single (particle)
CSDA-equation by using three techniques, the Lions-Lax-Milgram Theorem
(variational approach), the theory of $m$-dissipative operators and the theory
evolution operators (semigroup approach). The due a priori estimates are
derived and the positivity of solutions are retrieved. In addition, we prove
the corresponding results and estimates for the system of coupled transport
equations. The related existence results are given for the adjoint problem as
well. We also give some computational points (e.g. certain explicit formulas),

networks underlying many cellular and metabolic processes are important
realizations of such a scenario as typically one is interested in
reconstructing the time evolution of unobserved chemical concentrations
starting from the experimentally more accessible ones. We present an
application to this problem of a novel dynamical mean field approximation, the
Extended Plefka Expansion, which is based on a path integral description of the
stochastic dynamics. As a paradigmatic model we study the stochastic linear
dynamics of continuous degrees of freedom interacting via random Gaussian
couplings. The resulting joint distribution is known to be Gaussian and this
allows us to fully characterize the posterior statistics of the hidden nodes.
In particular the equal-time hidden-to-hidden variance -- conditioned on
observations -- gives the expected error at each node when the hidden time
courses are predicted based on the observations. We assess the accuracy of the
Extended Plefka Expansion in predicting these single node variances as well as
error correlations over time, focussing on the role of the system size and the
number of observed nodes.

of the conferencing links are small or high; there is only transmitter
conferencing or only receiver conferencing; or some symmetry conditions between
transmitter-conferencing and receiver-conferencing hold. We also determine the
per-user MG of the network when the number of conferencing rounds is unlimited.
Our results show that for small conferencing prelogs around 1/6, a single

demonstrate Sampling Bias, Intrinsic Image Difference and Fixed Cycle Pseudo
Random Sampling differentiate batches in training, which then affect learning
speeds on them. Because of this, the unbiased treatment of batches involved in
SGD creates improper load balancing. To address this issue, we present
Inconsistent Stochastic Gradient Descent (ISGD) to dynamically vary training
effort according to learning statuses on batches. Specifically ISGD leverages
techniques in Statistical Process Control to identify a undertrained batch.
Once a batch is undertrained, ISGD solves a new subproblem, a chasing logic
plus a conservative constraint, to accelerate the training on the batch while
avoid drastic parameter changes. Extensive experiments on a variety of datasets
demonstrate ISGD converges faster than SGD. In training AlexNet, ISGD is
21.05\% faster than SGD to reach 56\% top1 accuracy under the exactly same
experiment setup. We also extend ISGD to work on multiGPU or heterogeneous
distributed system based on data parallelism, enabling the batch size to be the
key to scalability. Then we present the study of ISGD batch size to the
learning rate, parallelism, synchronization cost, system saturation and
scalability. We conclude the optimal ISGD batch size is machine dependent.
Various experiments on a multiGPU system validate our claim. In particular,
ISGD trains AlexNet to 56.3% top1 and 80.1% top5 accuracy in 11.5 hours with 4

multi-layer extended gating grid to capture back-flowing ions at the expense of
live time and electron transparency. In this initial study, I perform
simulations of a four-layer grid for the ALICE and STAR time projection
chambers, using $\text{Ne}-\text{CO}_{2}\;(90-10)$ and
$\text{Ar}-\text{CH}_{4}\;(90-10)$ gas mixtures, respectively. I report the
live time and electron transparency for both 90% and 99% ion back-flow
suppression. Additionally, for the ALICE configuration I study several effects:
using a mesh vs. wire-plane grid, including a magnetic field, and varying the
over-voltage distribution in the gating region. For 90% ion back-flow
suppression, I achieve 75% live time with 86% electron transparency for ALICE,
and 95% live time with 83% electron transparency for STAR.

based on amplitude discrimination. The detector concept foresees a stack of 6
active layers, grouped in 3 sandwiches for determining the muon trajectories
through 3 planes. After investigating the characteristics of the photodiodes,
tests have been performed using two detection modules, each being composed from
a plastic scintillator sheet, $100 \times 25 \times 1\,$cm$^{3}$, with 12
parallel, equidistant ditches; each ditch filled with an optical fiber of
$1.5\,$mm thickness and always two fibers connected to form a channel. The
attenuation of the light response along the optical fiber and across the
channels have been tested. The measurements of the incident muons based on the
input amplitude discrimination indicate that this procedure is not efficient
and therefore not sufficient, as only about 30\% of the measured events could
be used in the reconstruction of the muon trajectories. Based on the studies
presented in this paper, the layout used for building the SiRO detector will be
changed as well as the analog acquisition technique will be replaced by a
digital one.

research in high energy physics (HEP) and astro-particles. In the last 11 years
the Beam-Test Facility (BTF) of the DA{\Phi}NE accelerator complex in the
Frascati laboratory has gained an important role in the European
infrastructures devoted to the development and testing of particle detectors.
At the same time the BTF operation has been largely shadowed, in terms of
resources, by the running of the DA{\Phi}NE electron-positron collider. The
present proposal is aimed at improving the present performance of the facility
from two different points of view: extending the range of application for the
LINAC beam extracted to the BTF lines, in particular in the (in some sense
opposite) directions of hosting fundamental physics and providing electron
irradiation also for industrial users; extending the life of the LINAC beyond
or independently from its use as injector of the DA{\Phi}NE collider, as it is
also a key element of the electron/positron beam facility. The main lines of
these two developments can be identified as: consolidation of the LINAC
infrastructure, in order to guarantee a stable operation in the longer term;
upgrade of the LINAC energy, in order to increase the facility capability
(especially for the almost unique extracted positron beam); doubling of the BTF
beam-lines, in order to cope with the signicant increase of users due to the
much wider range of applications.

to ancient times and formed the basis of physical thought well into modern

lasted until relatively recently. It was the advent of de Broglie's work and
its implications that revolutionized the concept of an elementary particle --
but unfortunately did not banish the idea of a point particle despite its
difficulties in both classical and quantum physics. Some of these problems are

  without added singularities",,,,,"math.CA q-bio.QM","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Let $X$ and $X^*$ denote a restricted ray transform along curves and a
corresponding backprojection operator, respectively. Theoretical analysis of
reconstruction from the data $Xf$ is usually based on a study of the
composition $X^* D X$, where $D$ is some local operator (usually a derivative).
If $X^*$ is chosen appropriately, then $X^* D X$ is a Fourier Integral Operator
(FIO) with singular symbol. The singularity of the symbol leads to the
appearance of artifacts (added singularities) that can be as strong as the
original (or, useful) singularities. By choosing $D$ in a special way one can
reduce the strength of added singularities, but it is impossible to get rid of
them completely.
  In the paper we follow a similar approach, but make two changes. First, we
replace $D$ with a nonlocal operator $\tilde D$ that integrates $Xf$ along a
curve in the data space. The result $\tilde D Xf$ resembles the generalized
Radon transform $R$ of $f$. The function $\tilde D Xf$ is defined on pairs
$(x_0,\Theta)\in U\times S^2$, where $U\subset\mathbb R^3$ is an open set
containing the support of $f$, and $S^2$ is the unit sphere in $\mathbb R^3$.
Second, we replace $X^*$ with a backprojection operator $R^*$ that integrates
with respect to $\Theta$ over $S^2$. It turns out that if $\tilde D$ and $R^*$
are appropriately selected, then the composition $R^* \tilde D X$ is an
elliptic pseudodifferential operator of order zero with principal symbol 1.
Thus, we obtain an approximate reconstruction formula that recovers all the
singularities correctly and does not produce artifacts. The advantage of our
approach is that by inserting $\tilde D$ we get access to the frequency
variable $\Theta$. In particular, we can incorporate suitable cut-offs in $R^*$
to eliminate bad directions $\Theta$, which lead to added singularities.

Because there is no net Aharonov-Bohm phase shift in the time-dependent case on
the commutative space, therefore, a tiny deviation from zero indicates new
physics. Based on the Seiberg-Witten map we obtain the gauge invariant and
Lorentz covariant Aharonov-Bohm phase shift in general case on noncommutative
space. We find there are two kinds of contribution: momentum-dependent and
momentum-independent corrections. For the momentum-dependent correction, there
is a cancellation between the magnetic and electric phase shifts, just like the
case on the commutative space. However, there is a non-trivial contribution in
the momentum-independent correction. This is true for both the time-independent
and time-dependent Aharonov-Bohm effects on the noncommutative space. However,
for the time-dependent Aharonov-Bohm effect, there is no overwhelming
background which exists in the time-independent Aharonov-Bohm effect on both
commutative and noncommutative space. Therefore, the time-dependent
Aharonov-Bohm can be sensitive to the spatial noncommutativity. \draftnote{The
net correction is proportional to the product of the magnetic fluxes through
the fundamental area represented by the noncommutative parameter $\theta$, and
through the surface enclosed by the trajectory of charged particle.} More
interestingly, there is an anti-collinear relation between the logarithms of
the magnetic field $B$ and the averaged flux $\Phi/N$ (N is the number of
fringes shifted). This nontrivial relation can also provide a way to test the
spatial noncommutativity. For $B\Phi/N\sim 1$, our estimation on the
experimental sensitivity shows that it can reach the $\rm 10GeV$ scale. This
sensitivity can be enhanced by using stronger magnetic field strength, larger
magnetic flux, as well as higher experimental precision on the phase shift.
