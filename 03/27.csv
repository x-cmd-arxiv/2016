real-world scenes. Our dataset contains both long and short video sequences,
and enables the quantitatively evaluation for RGB based tracking and
registration methods. To construct ground truth for the RGB sequences, we
simultaneously capture Near-Infrared (NIR) image sequences where dense markers
- visible only in NIR - represent ground truth positions. This allows for
comparison with automatically tracked RGB positions and the formation of error
metrics. Most previous datasets containing nonrigidly deforming sequences are
based on synthetic data. Our capture protocol enables us to acquire real-world
deforming objects with realistic photometric effects - such as blur and
illumination change - as well as occlusion and complex deformations. A public
evaluation website is constructed to allow for ranking of RGB image based
optical flow and other dense tracking algorithms, with various statistical
measures. Furthermore, we present an RGB-NIR multispectral optical flow model
allowing for energy optimization by adoptively combining featured information
from both the RGB and the complementary NIR channels. In our experiments we
evaluate eight existing RGB based optical flow methods on our new dataset. We
also evaluate our hybrid optical flow algorithm by comparing to two existing
multispectral approaches, as well as varying our input channels across RGB, NIR
and RGB-NIR.

fewer phonon calculations than the conventional QHA method, and also
facilitates the convenient analysis of the microscopic origins of macroscopic

non-wide-sense-stationary characteristics rise in massive MIMO channels.
Notable parameter variations are experienced along the base station array, such
as the average received energy at each antenna, and the directions of arrival
of signals impinging on different parts of the array. In this paper, a new
channel model is proposed to describe this spatial non-stationarity in massive
MIMO channels by incorporating the concepts of partially visible clusters and
wholly visible clusters. Furthermore, a closed-form expression of an upper
bound on the ergodic sum capacity is derived for the new model, and the
influence of the spatial non-stationarity on the sum capacity is analyzed.
Analysis shows that for non-identically-and-independent-distributed (i.i.d.)
Rayleigh fading channels, the non-stationarity benefits the sum capacity by
bringing a more even spread of channel eigenvalues. Specifically, more
partially visible clusters, smaller cluster visibility regions and a larger
antenna array can all help to yield a well-conditioned channel, and benefit the
sum capacity. This shows the advantage of using a large antenna array in a
non-i.i.d. channel: the sum capacity benefits not only from a higher array
gain, but also from a more spatially non-stationary channel. Numerical results
demonstrate our analysis and the tightness of the upper bound.

scheduling amounts to selecting transition probabilities for a discrete-time
Markov evolution which is designed to be consistent with certain initial and
final marginals. The random evolution is selected to be closest to a prior
measure on paths in the relative entropy sense, i.e., a Schroedinger bridge
between the two marginals. This is an atypical stochastic control problem where
the control consists in suitably modifying the transition mechanism. The prior
can incorporate cost of traversing edges or allocate equal probability to all
paths of equal length connecting any two given nodes, i.e., a uniform measure
on paths. This latter choice relies on the so-called Ruelle-Bowen random walk
and gives rise to a scheduling that tends to utilize all paths as uniformly as
the topology allows. Thus, when the Ruelle-Bowen law is taken as prior, the
transportation plan tends to lessen congestion and ensure a level of
robustness. We show that the Ruelle-Bowen law is itself a Schroedinger bridge
albeit with a prior that is not a probability measure. The paradigm of
Schroedinger bridges as a mechanism for scheduling transport on networks can be
adapted to graphs that are not strongly connected as well as to weighted
graphs. The latter leads to transportation plans that effect a compromise
between robustness and transportation cost.

thermal creep gas flow. This could support particle entrainment into the
atmosphere. Short time shadowing e.g. by the traverse of a larger dust devil
would enhance this effect. We find in microgravity experiments that mass
ejection rates are increased by a factor of 10 for several seconds if a light
source of 12.6 kW/$\rm m^2$ is turned off. Scaled to Mars this implies that
self-shadowing of a partially opaque dust devil might lead to a strongly
amplified flux of lifted material. We therefore suggest that self-shadowing
might be a mechanism on Mars to increase the total dust loading of a dust devil
and keep it self-sustained.

case of a heterogeneous product set $X = X_1 \times \ldots \times X_n$. In MCDA
elements of $X$ are interpreted as alternatives, characterized by criteria
taking values from the sets $X_i$. Previous axiomatizations of the Choquet
integral have been given for particular cases $X = Y^n$ and $X = \mathbb{R}^n$.
However, within multicriteria context such identicalness, hence
commensurateness, of criteria cannot be assumed a priori. This constitutes the
major difference of this paper from the earlier axiomatizations. In particular,
the notion of ""comonotonicity"" cannot be used in a heterogeneous structure, as
there does not exist a ""built-in"" order between elements of sets $X_i$ and

affects the formation locations for the observed close-in super-Earths in
exosolar systems. We find that a protoplanetary disk that includes a dead zone
(a region of low turbulence) has substantially more material in the inner parts
of the disk, possibly allowing for in situ formation. For the dead zone to last
the entire lifetime of the disk requires the active layer surface density to be
sufficiently small, <100 g/cm^2. Migration through a dead zone may be very slow
and thus super-Earth formation followed by migration towards the star through
the dead zone is less likely. For fully turbulent disks, there is not enough
material for in situ formation. However, in this case, super-Earths can form
farther out in the disk and migrate inwards on a reasonable timescale. We
suggest that both of these formation mechanisms operate in different planetary
systems. This can help to explain the observed large range in densities of
super-Earths because the formation location determines the composition.
Furthermore, we speculate that super-Earths could have formed in the inner
parts of our solar system and cleared the material in the region inside of
Mercury's orbit. The super-Earths could migrate through the gas disk and fall
into the Sun if the disk was sufficiently cool during the final gas disk
accretion process. While it is definitely possible to meet all of these
requirements, we don't expect them to occur in all systems, which may explain
why the solar system is somewhat special in its lack of super-Earths.

from heavy-ion collision experiments. With the emergence of many different
transport codes in recent years, it becomes important to estimate their
robustness in extracting physics information from experiments. We report on the
results of a transport code comparison project. 18 commonly used transport
codes were included in this comparison: 9 Boltzmann-Uehling-Uhlenbeck-type
codes and 9 Quantum-Molecular-Dynamics-type codes. These codes have been
required to simulate Au+Au collisions using the same physics input for mean
fields and for in-medium nucleon-nucleon cross sections, as well as the same
initialization set-up, the impact parameter, and other calculational parameters
at 100 and 400 AMeV incident energy. Among the codes we compare one-body
observables such as rapidity and transverse flow distributions. We also monitor
non-observables such as the initialization of the internal states of colliding
nuclei and their stability, the collision rates and the Pauli blocking. We find
that not completely identical initializations constitute partly for different
evolutions. Different strategies to determine the collision probabilities, and
to enforce the Pauli blocking, also produce considerably different results.
There is a substantial spread in the predictions for the observables, which is
much smaller at the higher incident energy. We quantify the uncertainties in
the collective flow resulting from the simulation alone as about $30\%$ at 100
AMeV and $13\%$ at 400 AMeV, respectively. We propose further steps within the
code comparison project to test the different aspects of transport simulations
in a box calculation of infinite nuclear matter. This should, in particular,
improve the robustness of transport model predictions at lower incident
energies where abundant amounts of data are available.

prime example and are thought to constrain bulk properties such as mechanical
stability and acoustic transmission. However, characterizing the dynamic nature
of mesoscale architectures in granular systems can be challenging. A growing
body of work has shown that graph theoretic approaches may provide a useful
foundation for tackling these problems. Here, we extend current approaches by
utilizing multilayer networks as a framework for directly quantifying the
evolution of mesoscale architecture in a compressed granular system. We examine
a quasi-two-dimensional aggregate of photoelastic disks, subject to biaxial
compression through a series of small, quasistatic steps. Treating particles as
network nodes and inter-particle forces as network edges, we construct a
multilayer network by linking together the series of static force networks that
exist at each strain step. We then extract the inherent mesoscale structure
from the system by using a generalization of community detection methods, and
we define quantitative measures to characterize the reconfiguration and
evolution of this structure throughout compression. By separately considering
the network of normal and tangential forces, we find that they display
different structural evolution. To test the sensitivity of the network model to
particle properties, we examine whether the method can distinguish a subsystem
of low-friction particles within a bath of higher-friction particles. We find
that this can be done by considering the network of tangential forces. The
results discussed throughout this study suggest that these novel network
science techniques may provide a direct way to compare and classify data from

shapes using a single hand-held consumer-grade RGB-D sensor at real-time rates.
Our method does not require a pre-defined shape template to start with and
builds up the scene model from scratch during the scanning process. Geometry
and motion are parameterized in a unified manner by a volumetric representation
that encodes a distance field of the surface geometry as well as the non-rigid
space deformation. Motion tracking is based on a set of extracted sparse color
features in combination with a dense depth-based constraint formulation. This
enables accurate tracking and drastically reduces drift inherent to standard
model-to-depth alignment. We cast finding the optimal deformation of space as a
non-linear regularized variational optimization problem by enforcing local
smoothness and proximity to the input constraints. The problem is tackled in
real-time at the camera's capture rate using a data-parallel flip-flop
optimization strategy. Our results demonstrate robust tracking even for fast
motion and scenes that lack geometric features.

present too heavily, is one of the most widespread human behavioral biases. It
has also been the subject of extensive study in the behavioral economics
literature. While the simplest models assume that the agents are naive,
reasoning about the future without taking their bias into account, there is
considerable evidence that people often behave in ways that are sophisticated
with respect to present bias, making plans based on the belief that they will
be present-biased in the future. For example, committing to a course of action
to reduce future opportunities for procrastination or overconsumption are
instances of sophisticated behavior in everyday life.
  Models of sophisticated behavior have lacked an underlying formalism that
allows one to reason over the full space of multi-step tasks that a
sophisticated agent might face. This has made it correspondingly difficult to
make comparative or worst-case statements about the performance of
sophisticated agents in arbitrary scenarios. In this paper, we incorporate the
notion of sophistication into a graph-theoretic model that we used in recent
work for modeling naive agents. This new synthesis of two formalisms -
sophistication and graph-theoretic planning - uncovers a rich structure that
wasn't apparent in the earlier behavioral economics work on this problem.
  In particular, our graph-theoretic model makes two kinds of new results
possible. First, we give tight worst-case bounds on the performance of
sophisticated agents in arbitrary multi-step tasks relative to the optimal
plan. Second, the flexibility of our formalism makes it possible to identify
new phenomena that had not been seen in prior literature: these include a
surprising non-monotonic property in the use of rewards to motivate
sophisticated agents and a framework for reasoning about commitment devices.

the nonlinearly realized symmetry. We also explain how supersymmetric models
provide an example for this construction with Goldstinos as matter fields, and
how one can use the $\kappa$-symmetry of the Green Schwarz action in
particular, to verify this nonlinear transformation for a specific matter field
representation. We finally restrict the target space dimension without

asynchronous sequence-based channel hopping (CH) with the maximal rendezvous
diversity is a representative technique to guarantee an upper bounded

various paper reported in the literature. In this paper, to investigate the
fundamental limits of these two metrics, we first derive lower bounds on the
MCTTR and MTTR, and then propose an asymmetric design which has the minimum
MCTTR and an improvement on MTTR than other previously known algorithms.
Moreover, when the number of licensed channels is odd, our proposed design
achieves the minimum MTTR. We also present the TTR performance of the proposed

general, new electromagnetic couplings and related phenomena are induced by the

correspond essentially to the following geometries: the Schwarzschild spacetime
and the spacetime around a rotating spherical mass in the weak field and slow
rotation regime. In the latter, we use the Parameterised Post-Newtonian (PPN)
formalism. We also explore the hypothesis that the electric and magnetic
properties of vacuum reflect the spacetime isometries. Therefore, the
permittivity and permeability tensors should not be considered homogeneous and
isotropic a priori. For spherical geometries we consider the effect of relaxing
the homogeneity assumption in the constitutive relations between the fields and
excitations. This affects the generalized Gauss and Maxwell-Amp\`{e}re laws
where the electric permittivity and magnetic permeability in vacuum depend on
the radial coordinate in accordance with the local isometries of space. For the
axially symmetric geometries we relax both the assumptions of homogeneity and
isotropy. We explore simple solutions and discuss the physical implications
related to different phenomena such as: the decay of electromagnetic fields in
the presence of gravity, magnetic terms in Gauss law due to the
gravitomagnetism of the spacetime around rotating objects, a frame-dragging
effect on electric fields and the possibility of a spatial (radial) variability
of the velocity of light in vacuum around spherical astrophysical objects for

These difficulties limit the performance of current state-of-art methods, which

present 3DMatch, a data-driven model that learns a local volumetric patch
descriptor for establishing correspondences between partial 3D data. To amass
training data for our model, we propose a self-supervised feature learning
method that leverages the millions of correspondence labels found in existing
RGB-D reconstructions. Experiments show that our descriptor is not only able to
match local geometry in new scenes for reconstruction, but also generalize to
different tasks and spatial scales (e.g. instance-level object model alignment
for the Amazon Picking Challenge, and mesh surface correspondence). Results
show that 3DMatch consistently outperforms other state-of-the-art approaches by

observations of resolved gravitational lenses can allow us to detect signals of
very weak variability and also provide information about the jet opacity and
structure. As an example, we investigate the variability of the flux-density
ratio between the two lensed images of the blazar B0218+357, using
dual-frequency cm-wave observations. Similar to our previously reported
submm-wave observations of the lensed blazar PKS1830-211, we observe a clear
chromatic variability, starting short before an increase in the flux-density of
the blazar. The evolution of the flux-density ratios between the blazar images
shows a more clear and rich structure than that of the mere lightcurves of each
individual image. The accuracy in the ratio measurements is allowing us to see
variability episodes in the blazar that are weaker than the natural scatter in
the absolute flux-density measurements. A simple opacity model in the jet is
used to consistently explain the difference between the flux-density-ratio
evolution at the two frequencies.

place, I discuss to what extent Refs.[1], [2] and [3] provide equivalent
results. I show that the phase-shift rate of the two-atom wave function
computed in Ref.[1], the van der Waals potential of the excited atom in Ref.[2]
and the level shift of the excited atom in Ref.[3] possess equivalent
expressions in the quasistationary approximation. In addition, I show that the
level shift of the ground state atom computed in Ref.[3] is equivalent to its
van der Waals potential. A diagrammatic representation of all those quantities
is provided. The equivalences among them are however not generic. In
particular, it is found that for the case of the interaction between two
identical atoms excited, the phase-shift rate and the van der Waals potentials
differ. Concerning the conflicting results of previous approaches in regards to
the spatial oscillation of the interactions, I conclude in agreement with
Refs.[1,3] that they refer to different physical quantities. The impacts of
free-space dissipation and finite excitation rates on the dynamics of the
potentials are analyzed. In contrast to Ref.[3], the oscillatory versus
monotonic spatial forms of the potentials of each atom are found not to be
related to the reversible versus irreversible nature of the excitation transfer
involved.

In this work, we propose a spatiotemporal attentional model that learns where
to look in a video directly from human fixation data. We model visual attention
with a mixture of Gaussians at each frame. This distribution is used to express
the probability of saliency for each pixel. Time consistency in videos is
modeled hierarchically by: 1) deep 3D convolutional features to represent
spatial and short-term time relations and 2) a long short-term memory network
on top that aggregates the clip-level representation of sequential clips and
therefore expands the temporal domain from few frames to seconds. The

estimation using human fixations as training data, without knowledge of the
action in each video. Our experiments on Hollywood2 show state-of-the-art
performance on saliency prediction for video. We also show that our attentional

argued that their lacking necessitation makes regular modal logics better
suited than normal modal logics at the formalization of epistemic and deontic

additivity and multiplicativity turn out to be key to extend J\'onsson's
original proof of canonicity to the full Sahlqvist class of certain regular

interestingly, additivity and multiplicativity are key to J\'onsson-style

the definition of Sahlqvist inequalities for regular modal logics on a
distributive lattice propositional base; the proof of their canonicity

constant scattering time approximation, semi-classic transport coefficients are
performed through solving Boltzmann transport equations. It is found that the
SOC has more obvious influence on power factor in p-type doping than in n-type
doping, leading to a detrimental effect in p-type doping. These can be
explained by considering the SOC influences on the valence bands and conduction
bands near the Fermi level. The lattice thermal conductivity as a function of
temperature is calculated, and the corresponding lattice thermal conductivity
is 14.5 $\mathrm{W m^{-1} K^{-1}}$ at room temperature. By comparing the
experimental transport coefficients with calculated ones, the scattering time
is attained for 0.333 $\times$ $10^{-14}$ s. Finally, the thermoelectric figure
of merit $ZT$ can be attained, and the $ZT$ value can be as high as 0.30 at
high temperature by choosing appropriate doping level. It is possible to reduce
lattice thermal conductivity by point defects and boundaries, and make
half-Heusler $\mathrm{ZrNiPb}$ become potential candidate for efficient
thermoelectricity.

seminally observed and exploited by Marcus Kracht, in the context of his
characterization of the modal axioms (which he calls primitive formulas) which
can be effectively transformed into `analytic' structural rules of display
calculi. In this context, a rule is `analytic' if adding it to a display
calculus preserves Belnap's cut-elimination theorem. In recent years, the
state-of-the-art in correspondence theory has been uniformly extended from
classical modal logic to diverse families of nonclassical logics, ranging from
(bi-)intuitionistic (modal) logics, linear, relevant and other substructural
logics, to hybrid logics and mu-calculi. This generalization has given rise to
a theory called unified correspondence, the most important technical tools of
which are the algorithm ALBA, and the syntactic characterization of
Sahlqvist-type classes of formulas and inequalities which is uniform in the
setting of normal DLE-logics (logics the algebraic semantics of which is based
on bounded distributive lattices). We apply unified correspondence theory, with
its tools and insights, to extend Kracht's results and prove his claims in the
setting of DLE-logics. The results of the present paper characterize the space

MHD systems with arbitrary small viscosity. In particular, we provide a
rigorous justification for the following dynamical phenomenon observed in many

shape of the solution persists for a very long time (proportional to the
Reynolds number), thereafter, the solution will be damped due to the long-time
accumulation of the diffusive effects, eventually, the total energy of the
system becomes extremely small compared to the viscosity so that the diffusion
takes over and the solution afterwards decays fast in time.
  We do not assume any condition on the symmetry or on the vorticity. The size
of data and the a priori estimates do not depend on viscosity. The proof is
builded upon a novel use of the basic energy identity and a geometric study of
the characteristic hypersurfaces. The approach is partly inspired by

logical framework for Judgment Aggregation. Our main contribution is a
generalization of Herzberg's algebraic approach to characterization results in
on judgment aggregation and propositional-attitude aggregation, characterizing
certain Arrovian classes of aggregators as Boolean algebra and MV-algebra
homomorphisms, respectively. The characterization result of the present paper
applies to agendas of formulas of an arbitrary selfextensional logic. This
notion comes from AAL, and encompasses a vast class of logics, of which
classical, intuitionistic, modal, many-valued and relevance logics are special
cases. To each selfextensional logic $\Sm$, a unique class of algebras
$\Alg\Sm$ is canonically associated by the general theory of AAL. We show that
for any selfextensional logic $\Sm$ such that $\Alg\Sm$ is closed under direct
products, any algebra in $\Alg\Sm$ can be taken as the set of truth values on
which an aggregation problem can be formulated. In this way, judgment
aggregation on agendas formalized in classical, intuitionistic, modal,
many-valued and relevance logic can be uniformly captured as special cases.
This paves the way to the systematic study of a wide array of ""realistic
agendas"" made up of complex formulas, the propositional connectives of which
are interpreted in ways which depart from their classical interpretation. This
is particularly interesting given that, as observed by Dietrich, nonclassical
(subjunctive) interpretation of logical connectives can provide a strategy for
escaping impossibility results.

magnetized pulsars travel through asteroid belts of other stars. We show that a
repeating FRB could originate from such a pulsar encountering lots of asteroids
in the belt. During each pulsar-asteroid impact, an electric field induced
outside the asteroid has such a large component parallel to the stellar
magnetic field that electrons are torn off the asteroidal surface and
accelerated to ultra-relativistic energies instantaneously. Subsequent movement
of these electrons along magnetic field lines will cause coherent curvature
radiation, which can account for all the properties of an FRB. In addition,
this model can self-consistently explain the typical duration, luminosity, and
repetitive rate of the seventeen bursts of FRB 121102. The predicted occurrence
rate of repeating FRB sources may imply that our model would be testable in the

magnetar deposits its rotational energy in the form of a relativistic
leptonized wind. We found that the optical transient PTF11agg could be the
first evidence for the formation of post-merger millisecond magnetars. To
enhance the probability of finding more evidence for the post-merger magnetar
formation, it is better to extend the observational channel to other photon
energy bands. In this paper we propose to search the signature of post-merger
magnetar formation in X-ray and especially gamma-ray bands. We calculate the
SSC emission of the reverse shock powered by post-merger millisecond magnetars.
We find that the SSC component peaks at $1\,{\rm GeV}$ in the spectral energy
distribution and extends to $\gtrsim 10\,{\rm TeV}$ for typical parameters.
These energy bands are quite suitable for Fermi/LAT and CTA, which, with their
current observational sensitivities, can detect the SSC emission powered by
post-merger magnetars up to $1\,{\rm Gpc}$. NuSTAR, sensible in X-ray bands,
can detect the formation of post-merger millisecond magnetars at redshift
$z\sim 1$. Future improvement in sensitivity of CTA can also probe the birth of
post-merger millisecond magnetars at redshift $z\sim 1$. However, because of
the $\gamma$-$\gamma$ collisions, strong high-energy emission is clearly
predicted only for ejecta masses lower than $10^{-3}M_\odot$.

to the larger molecular mass ratio. In addition, the increase in the pressure
ratio reduces the difference in the molecular velocities between the two

cool stars with convective outer layers, compared to hotter stars with
radiative outer layers. Observing this effect is challenging, because it
requires large and well-characterized samples including both hot and cool
stars. Here we seek evidence for the predicted dependence of circularization
upon stellar type, using a sample of 945 eclipsing binaries observed by Kepler.
This sample complements earlier studies of this effect, which employed smaller
samples of better-characterized stars. For each Kepler binary we measure
$e\cos\omega$ based on the relative timing of the primary and secondary
eclipses. We examine the distribution of $e\cos\omega$ as a function of period
for binaries composed of hot stars, cool stars, and mixtures of the two types.
At the shortest periods, hot-hot binaries are most likely to be eccentric; for
periods shorter than 4 days, significant eccentricities occur frequently for
hot-hot binaries, but not for hot-cool or cool-cool binaries. This is in
qualitative agreement with theoretical expectations based on the slower
dissipation rates of hot stars. However, the interpretation of our results is
complicated by the largely unknown ages and evolutionary states of the stars in
our sample.

$\ell^1(\mathbb H,\mathbb C)$ and group $C^\ast$-algebra $C^\ast(\mathbb H)$ of
the discrete Heisenberg group $\mathbb H$. At first, a short review of Wiener's
Lemma in its classical form and general results about invertibility in group
algebras of nilpotent groups will be presented. The known literature on this
topic suggests that invertibility investigations in the group algebras of
$\mathbb H$ rely on the complete knowledge of $\widehat{\mathbb H}$ -- the dual
of $\mathbb H$, i.e., the space of unitary equivalence classes of irreducible
unitary representations. We will describe the dual of ${\mathbb H}$ explicitly
and discuss its structure. Wiener's Lemma provides a convenient condition to
verify invertibility in $\ell^1(\mathbb H,\mathbb C)$ and $C^\ast(\mathbb H)$
which bypasses $\widehat{\mathbb H}$. The proof of Wiener's Lemma for $\mathbb
H$ relies on local principles and can be generalised to countable nilpotent
groups. As our analysis shows, the main representation theoretical objects to
study invertibility in group algebras of nilpotent groups are the corresponding
primitive ideal spaces. Wiener's Lemma for $\mathbb H$ has interesting
applications in algebraic dynamics and Time-Frequency Analysis which will be
presented in this article as well.

heavy-ion collisions in the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) at
Brookhaven National Lab and in the Large Hadron Collider at CERN and have been
used to probe the topological configurations of the QCD vacua. A strong
magnetic field can affect the character and location of the QCD critical point,
influence the QCD phases, and lead to anomalous transport of charge. To take
advantage of the magnetic field as a probe of QCD at higher baryon densities,
we are going to need experiments capable to scan the lower energy region. In
this context, the nuclotron-based ion collider facility (NICA) at JINR offers a
unique opportunity to explore such a region and complement alternative programs
at RHIC and other facilities. In this paper we discuss some relevant problems
of the interplay between QCD and magnetic fields and the important role the
experiments at NICA can play in tackling them.

uncertainties from the dark matter distribution and allow for unspecified

fit that the strength and shape of the $\gamma$-ray spectrum can indeed be
described by the model in various regions of dark matter masses and couplings.
Constraints from invisible Higgs decays, direct dark matter searches, indirect
searches in dwarf galaxies and for $\gamma$-ray lines, and constraints from the
dark matter relic density reduce the parameter space to dark matter masses near
the Higgs resonance. We find two viable regions: one where the Higgs-dark
matter coupling is of ${\cal O}(10^{-2})$, and an additional dark matter
component beyond the scalar WIMP of our model is preferred, and one region
where the Higgs-dark matter coupling may be significantly smaller, but where
the scalar WIMP constitutes a significant fraction or even all of dark matter.
Both viable regions are hard to probe in future direct detection and collider
experiments.

a curvature singularity at the origin. Then, we regard varying cosmological

approaches and show that using Weinhold, Ruppeiner and Quevedo metrics leads to
existence of ensemble dependency while HPEM metric yields consistent picture.
For neutral solutions, it will be shown that generalization to massive gravity
