submillimeter (submm) and millimeter (mm) wavelengths in the spectral energy
distribution (SED) of many low-metallicity galaxies. The goal of the present
study is to model separately the emission from the star forming (SF) component
and the emission from the diffuse interstellar medium (ISM) in the nearby
spiral galaxy M33. We decomposed the observed SED of M33 into its SF and
diffuse components. Mid-infrared (MIR) and far-infrared (FIR) fluxes were
extracted from Spitzer and Herschel data. At submm and mm wavelengths, we used
ground-based observations from APEX to measure the emission from the SF
component and data from the Planck space telescope to estimate the diffuse
emission. Both components were separately fitted using radiation transfer
models based on standard dust properties and a realistic geometry. Both modeled
SEDs were combined to build the global SED of M33. In addition, the radiation
field necessary to power the dust emission in our modeling was compared with
observations from GALEX, Sloan, and Spitzer. Our modeling is able to reproduce
the observations at MIR and FIR wavelengths, but we found a strong excess of
emission at submm and mm wavelengths, where the model expectations severely
underestimate the LABOCA and Planck fluxes. We also found that the ultraviolet
(UV) radiation escaping the galaxy is 70% higher than the model predictions. We
determined a gas-to-dust mass ratio Gdust~100, significantly lower than the
value expected from the sub-solar metallicity of M33. We discussed different
hypotheses to explain the discrepancies found in our study (i.e., excess of
emission at submm and mm wavelengths, deficit of UV attenuation, and abnormally
low value of Gdust), concluding that different dust properties in M33 is the
most plausible explanation.

addresses the need for a fast calibration method for direct imaging radio
astronomy correlators. Direct imaging involves a spatial fast Fourier transform
of antenna signals, alleviating an $\mathcal{O}(N_{\mathrm{ant}}^2)$
computational bottleneck typical in radio correlators, and yielding a more
gentle $\mathcal{O}(N_g \log_2 N_g)$ scaling, where $N_{\mathrm{ant}}$ is the
number of antennas in the array and $N_g$ is the number of grid points in the
imaging analysis. This can save orders of magnitude in computation cost for
next generation arrays consisting of hundreds or thousands of antennas.
However, because antenna signals are mixed in the imaging correlator without
creating visibilities, gain correction must be applied prior to imaging, rather
than on visibilities post-correlation. We develop the EPICal algorithm to form
gain solutions quickly and without ever forming visibilities. This method
scales as the number of antennas, and produces results comparable to those from
visibilities. We use simulations to demonstrate the EPICal technique and study
the noise properties of our gain solutions, showing they are similar to
visibility based solutions in realistic situations. By applying EPICal to two
seconds of Long Wavelength Array data we achieve a 65% dynamic range
improvement compared to uncalibrated images, showing this algorithm is a
promising solution for next generation instruments.

approach leads us to a sixth order model in derivatives with either a massive

Stueckelberg field we obtain a new scalar-tensor model for massive gravitons.
It is ghost free and Weyl invariant at linearized level. The model can be
nonlinearly completed into a scalar field coupled to the NMG theory. The
elimination of the scalar field leads to a nonlocal modification of the NMG.
  We also prove to all orders in derivatives that there is no local, ghost free
embedding of the linearized NMG equations of motion around Minkowski space when
written in terms of one symmetric tensor. Regarding that point, NMG differs
from the Fierz-Pauli theory, since in later case we can replace the

variable, instead of voltage. The main purpose of this paper is to derive the
governing equations for a current-controlled piezo-electric beam and to
investigate stabilizability. Besides the consideration of current control,
there are several new aspects to the model here. Most significantly, magnetic
effects are included. For the electromagnetic part of the model, electrical
potential and magnetic vector potential are chosen to be quadratic-through
thickness to include the induced effects of the electromagnetic field. Two sets
of decoupled system of partial differential equations are obtained; one for
stretching motion and another one for bending motion. Hamilton's principle is
used to derive a boundary value problem that models a single piezo-electric
beam actuated by a charge (or current) source at the electrodes. Current or
charge controllers at the electrodes can only control the stretching motion.
Attention is therefore focused on control of the stretching equations in this
paper. It is shown that the Lagrangian of the beam is invariant under certain
transformations. A Coulomb-type gauge condition which is widely used in the
electromagnetic theory is used here. This gauge condition decouples the
electrical potential equation from the equations of the magnetic potential. A
semigroup approach is used to prove that the Cauchy problem is well-posed.
Unlike the voltage or charge actuation, a bounded control operator in the
natural energy space is obtained in the current actuation case. The paper
concludes with analysis of stabilizability and comparison with other actuation
approaches and models.

null space, images of the same person are collapsed into a single point thus
minimising the within-class scatter to the extreme and maximising the relative

signature is $\sim 15 M_\oplus$: this value is strongly dependent on disc
temperature and changes slightly with wavelength (favouring the submm). We also
confirm previous results that there is a minimum planet mass of $\sim 20
M_\oplus$ that produces a pressure maximum in the disc: only planets above this
threshold mass generate a dust trap that can eventually create a hole in the
submm dust. Below this mass, planets produce annular enhancements in dust
outward of the planet and a reduction in the vicinity of the planet. These
features are in steady state and can be understood in terms of variations in
the dust radial velocity, imposed by the perturbed gas pressure radial profile,
analogous to a traffic jam. We also show how planet masses can be derived from

calculate the spectral functions $\rho_{\sigma, \pi}(\omega,\, p)$ in the
scalar ($\sigma$) and pseudoscalar ($\pi$) channels beyond the random phase
approximation in the quark--meson model. At finite baryon chemical potential
$\mu$ with a finite quark mass, the baryon-number fluctuation is coupled to the
scalar channel and the spectral function in the $\sigma$ channel has a support
not only in the time-like ($\omega\,>\,p$) but also in the space-like
($\omega\,<\, p$) regions, which correspond to the mesonic and the
particle--hole phonon excitations, respectively. We find that the energy of the
peak position of the latter becomes vanishingly small with the height being
enhanced as the system approaches the QCD critical point, which is a
manifestation of the fact that the phonon mode is the {\em soft mode}
associated with the second-order transition at the QCD critical point, as has
been suggested by some authors. Moreover, our extensive calculation of the
spectral function in the $(\omega, p)$ plane enables us to see that the mesonic
and phonon modes have the respective definite dispersion relations
$\omega_{\sigma.{\rm ph}}(p)$, and it turns out that $\omega_{\sigma}(p)$
crosses the light-cone line into the space-like region, and then eventually
merges into the phonon mode as the system approaches the critical point more
closely. This implies that the sigma-mesonic mode also becomes soft at the
critical point. We also provide numerical stability conditions that are
necessary for obtaining the accurate effective potential from the flow

computational effects such as nondeterminism, statefulness, and exceptions. It
turns out that equipping a monad with a (uniform) iteration operator satisfying
a set of natural axioms allows for modelling iterative computations just as
abstractly. The emerging monads are called complete Elgot monads. It has been
shown recently that extending complete Elgot monads with free effects (e.g.
operations of sending/receiving messages over channels) canonically leads to
generalized coalgebraic resumption monads, previously used as semantic domains

the relationship between abstract complete Elgot monads and those that capture
coalgebraic resumptions, by comparing the corresponding categories of

of kernel learning remains challenging, with only a few heuristics and very
little theory. This is of particular importance in methods based on estimation
of kernel mean embeddings of probability measures. For characteristic kernels,
which include most commonly used ones, the kernel mean embedding uniquely
determines its probability measure, so it can be used to design a powerful
statistical testing framework, which includes nonparametric two-sample and
independence tests. In practice, however, the performance of these tests can be
very sensitive to the choice of kernel and its lengthscale parameters. To
address this central issue, we propose a new probabilistic model for kernel
mean embeddings, the Bayesian Kernel Embedding model, combining a Gaussian
process prior over the Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space containing the mean
embedding with a conjugate likelihood function, thus yielding a closed form
posterior over the mean embedding. The posterior mean of our model is closely
related to recently proposed shrinkage estimators for kernel mean embeddings,
while the posterior uncertainty is a new, interesting feature with various
possible applications. Critically for the purposes of kernel learning, our
model gives a simple, closed form marginal pseudolikelihood of the observed
data given the kernel hyperparameters. This marginal pseudolikelihood can
either be optimized to inform the hyperparameter choice or fully Bayesian
inference can be used.

Hydration/dehidration phenomena concerning water molecules confined close to
the molecular surface were investigated. A notable dewetting of the hydrophobic
surfaces was observed together with the reorientation of the water molecules
close to the surface. The hydrogen bonding network was formed to accommodate
cavities next to the surfaces as well as beyond the first hydration shell. The
effects were most strongly pronounced in the case of concave surfaces having
large curvature. This simplified model can be further used to evaluate the
thermodynamic fingerprint of the docking of hydrophobic ligands.

given monotonicity are generically either convex or concave functions. This
makes them suitable for fitting either freezing or thawing quintessence models
but not both simultaneously. Fitting a dataset based on a freezing model with
an unsuitable (concave when increasing) $w(z)$ parametrization (like CPL) can
lead to significant misleading features like crossing of the phantom divide
line, incorrect $w(z=0)$, incorrect slope \etc that are not present in the
underlying cosmological model. To demonstrate this fact we generate scattered
cosmological data both at the level of $w(z)$ and the luminosity distance
$D_L(z)$ based on either thawing or freezing quintessence models and fit them
using parametrizations of convex and of concave type. We then compare
statistically significant features of the best fit $w(z)$ with actual features
of the underlying model. We thus verify that the use of unsuitable
parametrizations can lead to misleading conclusions. In order to avoid these
problems it is important to either use both convex and concave parametrizations
and select the one with the best $\chi^2$ or use principal component analysis
thus splitting the redshift range into independent bins. In the latter case
however, significant information about the slope of $w(z)$ at high redshifts is
lost. Finally, we propose a new family of parametrizations (nCPL) $w(z)=w_0+w_a
(\frac{z}{1+z})^n$ which generalizes the CPL and interpolates between thawing
and freezing parametrizations as the parameter $n$ increases to values larger
than 1.

disappearance as a radio source in late 2008. Repeated observations through
2016 have not detected radio pulsations again. The torque on the neutron star,
as inferred from its rotation frequency derivative f-dot, decreased in an
unsteady manner by a factor of 3 in the first year of radio monitoring. In
contrast, during its final year as a detectable radio source, the torque
decreased steadily by only 9%. The period-averaged flux density, after
decreasing by a factor of 20 during the first 10 months of radio monitoring,
remained steady in the next 22 months, at an average of 0.7+/-0.3 mJy at 1.4
GHz, while still showing day-to-day fluctuations by factors of a few. There is
evidence that during this last phase of radio activity the magnetar had a steep
radio spectrum, in contrast to earlier behavior. There was no secular decrease
that presaged its radio demise. During this time the pulse profile continued to
display large variations, and polarimetry indicates that the magnetic geometry
remained consistent with that of earlier times. We supplement these results
with X-ray timing of the pulsar from its outburst in 2003 up to 2014. For the

electrical double layer of a model electrolyte or an ionic liquid are reported.
The ions of a real electrolyte or an ionic liquid are usually not spheres; in
ionic liquids, the cations are molecular ions. In the past, this asymmetry has
been modelled by considering spheres that are asymmetric in size and/or valence
(viz., the primitive model) or by dimer cations that are formed by tangentially
touching spheres. In this paper we consider spherical ions that are asymmetric
in size and mimic the asymmetrical shape through an off-center charge that is
located away from the center of the cation spheres, while the anion charge is
at the center of anion spheres. The various singlet density and potential
profiles are compared to (i) the dimer situation, that is, the constituent
spheres of the dimer cation are tangentially tethered, and (ii) the standard
primitive model. The results reveal the double layer structure to be
substantially impacted especially when the cation is the counterion. As well as
being of intrinsic interest, this off-center charge model may be useful for
theories that consider spherical models and introduce the off-center charge as
a perturbation.

to play an important role as intermediates in the SF process in these systems.
In molecular crystals, electrostatic screening effects and band formation can
be significant in lowering the energy of CT states, enhancing their potential

adopt a computational approach which is acceptably accurate, relatively
inexpensive, which and scales well to larger systems, thus enabling the study

code, but our electrostatic correction method is in principle applicable in

requests to a set of uniform servers without a centralized controller.
Classically, such problems are modeled as static balls into bins processes,
where $m$ balls (tasks) are to be distributed to $n$ bins (servers). In a
seminal work, Azar et al. proposed the sequential strategy \greedy{d} for
$n=m$. When thrown, a ball queries the load of $d$ random bins and is allocated
to a least loaded of these. Azar et al. showed that $d=2$ yields an exponential
improvement compared to $d=1$. Berenbrink et al. extended this to $m\gg n$,
showing that the maximal load difference is independent of $m$ for $d=2$ (in
contrast to $d=1$).
  We propose a new variant of an \emph{infinite} balls into bins process. Each
round an expected number of $\lambda n$ new balls arrive and are distributed
(in parallel) to the bins. Each non-empty bin deletes one of its balls. This
setting models a set of servers processing incoming requests, where clients can
query a server's current load but receive no information about parallel
requests. We study the \greedy{d} distribution scheme in this setting and show
a strong self-stabilizing property: For \emph{any} arrival rate
$\lambda=\lambda(n)<1$, the system load is time-invariant. Moreover, for
\emph{any} (even super-exponential) round $t$, the maximum system load is
(w.h.p.) $O(\frac{1}{1-\lambda}\cdot\log\frac{n}{1-\lambda})$ for $d=1$ and
$O(\log\frac{n}{1-\lambda})$ for $d=2$. In particular, \greedy{2} has an
exponentially smaller system load for high arrival rates.

represented as sequences of smoothly-varying features . In cases where the
feature spaces can be structured as Riemannian manifolds, the corresponding
representations become trajectories on manifolds. Analysis of these
trajectories is challenging due to non-linearity of underlying spaces and
high-dimensionality of trajectories. In vision problems, given the nature of
physical systems involved, these phenomena are better characterized on a
low-dimensional manifold compared to the space of Riemannian trajectories. For
instance, if one does not impose physical constraints of the human body, in
data involving human action analysis, the resulting representation space will
have highly redundant features. Learning an effective, low-dimensional
embedding for action representations will have a huge impact in the areas of
search and retrieval, visualization, learning, and recognition. The difficulty
lies in inherent non-linearity of the domain and temporal variability of
actions that can distort any traditional metric between trajectories. To
overcome these issues, we use the framework based on transported square-root
velocity fields (TSRVF); this framework has several desirable properties,
including a rate-invariant metric and vector space representations. We propose
to learn an embedding such that each action trajectory is mapped to a single
point in a low-dimensional Euclidean space, and the trajectories that differ
only in temporal rates map to the same point. We utilize the TSRVF
representation, and accompanying statistical summaries of Riemannian
trajectories, to extend existing coding methods such as PCA, KSVD and Label
Consistent KSVD to Riemannian trajectories or more generally to Riemannian

researchers to switch from deterministic to stochastic description of the
phenomena. The procedure of stochastization of one-step process was formulated.
It allows to write down the master equation based on the type of of the kinetic
equations and assumptions about the nature of the process. The kinetics of the
interaction has recently attracted attention because it often occurs in the
physical, chemical, technical, biological, environmental, economic, and
sociological systems. However, there are no general methods for the direct
study of this equation. Leaving in the expansion terms up to the second order
we can get the Fokker-Planck equation, and thus the Langevin equation. It
should be clearly understood that these equations are approximate recording of
the master equation. However, this does not eliminate the need for the study of
the master equation. Moreover, the power series produced during the master
equation decomposition may be divergent (for example, in spatial models). This
makes it impossible to apply the classical perturbation theory. It is proposed
to use quantum field perturbation theory for the statistical systems (the
so-called Doi method). This work is a methodological material that describes
the principles of master equation solution based on quantum field perturbation
theory methods. The characteristic property of the work is that it is
intelligible for non-specialists in quantum field theory. As an example the
Verhulst model is used because of its simplicity and clarity (the first order
equation is independent of the spatial variables, however, contains
non-linearity). We show the full equivalence of the operator and combinatorial
methods of obtaining and study of the one-step process master equation.

We prove that nontrivial frequency combs can only be observed for special

has been previously documented in experiments and numerical simulations. E.g.,
if the detuning parameter $\zeta$ is too large then nontrivial frequency combs
do not exist, cf. Theorem 2. Additionally, we show that for large ranges of

bifurcate from curves of trivial frequency combs. Our results rely on the proof

Cepheids having candidate companions, based on their positions in
color--magnitude diagrams, and having separations $\geq$5$""$ from the Cepheids.
We use follow-up observations of 14 of these candidates with XMM-Newton, and of
one of them with ROSAT, to separate X-ray-active young stars (probable physical
companions) from field stars (chance alignments). Our preliminary estimate,
based on the optical and X-ray observations, is that only 3\% of the Cepheids
in the sample have wide companions. Our survey easily detects resolved
main-sequence companions as faint as spectral type K\null. Thus the fact that
the two most probable companions (those of FF~Aql and RV~Sco) are earlier than
type K is not simply a function of the detection limit. We find no physical
companions having separations larger than 4,000~AU in the X-ray survey. Two
Cepheids are exceptions in that they do have young companions at significantly
larger separations ($\delta$~Cep and S~Nor), but both belong to a cluster or a
loose association, so our working model is that they are not gravitationally
bound binary members, but rather cluster/association members. All of these
properties provide constraints on both star formation and subsequent dynamical
evolution. The low frequency of true physical companions at separations $>\!5""$
is confirmed by examination of the subset of the nearest Cepheids and also the

with the tangent bundle of the foliation, and derive some consequences. In
particular, we introduce the definition of weakly reduced singularities for

primitives of MPI-3 makes MPI an attractive candidate for the implementation of
PGAS models. However, the performance of such implementation suffers from the
fact, that current MPI RMA implementations typically have a large overhead when
source and target of a communication request share a common, local physical
memory. In this paper, we present an optimized PGAS-like runtime system which
uses the new MPI-3 shared-memory extensions to serve intra-node communication
requests and MPI-3 one-sided communication primitives to serve inter-node
communication requests. The performance of our runtime system is evaluated on a
Cray XC40 system through low-level communication benchmarks, a random-access
benchmark and a stencil kernel. The results of the experiments demonstrate that
the performance of our hybrid runtime system matches the performance of
low-level RMA libraries for intra-node transfers, and that of MPI-3 for
inter-node transfers.

defined a structure of complex manifold on the set of isomorphism classes of
marked closed Riemann surfaces of genus g. The complex manifold he obtained is
the space called today Teichm\""uller space. In the same paper, Teichm\""uller
introduced the so-called universal Teichm\""uller curve -- a space over
Teichm\""uller space where the fiber above each point is a Riemann surface
representing that point. In fact, Teichm\""uller proved the existence of the
Teichm\""uller curve as a space of Riemann surfaces parametrized by an analytic
space, with an existence and uniqueness theorem establishing this analytic
structure. This result was later reformulated and proved by Grothendieck in a
series of ten lectures he gave at Cartan's seminar in 1960-1961. In his
approach , Grothendieck replaced Teichm\""uller's explicit parameters by a
general construction of fiber bundles whose base is an arbitrary analytic
space. This work on Teichm\""uller space led him to recast the bases of analytic
geometry using the language of categories and functors. In Grothendieck's
words, the Teichm\""uller curve becomes a space representing a functor from the
category of analytic spaces into the category of sets. In this survey, we
comment on Grothendieck's series of lectures. The survey is primarily addressed
to low-dimensional topologists and geometers. In presenting Grothendieck's
results, we tried to explain or rephrase in more simple terms some notions that
are usually expressed in the language of algebraic geometry. However, it is not
possible to short-circuit the language of categories and functors. The survey
is also addressed to those algebraic geometers who wish to know how the notion
of moduli space evolved in connection with Teichm\""uller theory. Explaining the
origins of mathematical ideas contributes in dispensing justice to their
authors and it usually renders the theory that is surveyed more attractive. The
final version of this paper will appear as a chapter in Volume VI of the
Handbook of Teichm\""uller theory. This volume is dedicated to the memory of
Alexander Grothendieck.

understanding human activities in the virtual world from a geographic
perspective. This paper examines spatial distribution of tweets and densities
within cities. The cities refer to natural cities that are automatically
aggregated from a country's small street blocks, so called city blocks. We
adopted street blocks (rather than census tracts) as the basic geographic units
and topological center (rather than geometric center) in order to assess how
tweets and densities vary from the center to the peripheral border. We found
that, within a city from the center to the periphery, the tweets first increase
and then decrease, while the densities decrease in general. These increases and
decreases fluctuate dramatically, and differ significantly from those if census
tracts are used as the basic geographic units. We also found that the decrease
of densities from the center to the periphery is less significant, and even
disappears, if an arbitrarily defined city border is adopted. These findings
prove that natural cities and their topological centers are better than their
counterparts (conventionally defined cities and city centers) for geographic
research. Based on this study, we believe that tweet densities can be a good
surrogate of population densities. If this belief is proved to be true, social
media data could help solve the dispute surrounding exponential or power
function of urban population density.

While this theory can guarantee a lower bound on the stretching rate of certain
material lines, it does not indicate what fraction of the fluid actually
participates in this minimally mandated mixing. Indeed, the area in which
effective mixing takes place depends on physical parameters such as the
Reynolds number. To help clarify this dependency, we numerically simulate the
effects of a batch stirring device on a 2D incompressible Newtonian fluid in
the laminar regime. In particular, we calculate the finite time Lyapunov
exponent (FTLE) field for three different stirring protocols, one topologically
complex (pseudo-Anosov) and two simple (finite-order), over a range of
viscosities. After extracting appropriate measures indicative of both the
amount of mixing and the area of effective mixing from the FTLE field, we see a
clearly defined Reynolds number range in which the relative efficacy of the
pseudo-Anosov protocol over the finite-order protocols justifies the
application of topological chaos. More unexpectedly, we see that while the
measures of effective mixing area increase with increasing Reynolds number for
the finite-order protocols, they actually exhibit non-monotonic behavior for
the pseudo-Anosov protocol.

crystal structure, it is predicted to be a TCI. We show systematic decrease of
the bulk carrier density with the increasing Se concentration, demonstrating
that the alloying principle works. In addition, we map out the phase diagram of
the cubic to the orthorhombic structural transition as a function of the Se
concentration. This was made possible by studying alloy nanoplates which remain
single-crystalline and is either in the cubic or the orthorhombic phase, in
contrast to bulk alloys that would exhibit polycrystalline grains. Lastly, we
investigate systematically the ferroelectric transition associated with the
structural transition from the cubic to the rhombohedral phase for SnSexTe1-x.

oscillator with an accuracy which scales inversely with the square root of the
number of photons in the oscillator. Our results are obtained by using a grid
state as a sensor state for detecting small translations in phase space
(displacements). Grid states were first proposed in (see
https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevA.64.012310 ) for encoding a qubit into an
oscillator: an efficient preparation protocol of such states, using a coupling
to a qubit, was developed in (see https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevA.93.012315 ).
We compare the performance of the grid state with the quantum compass or cat
code state and place our results in the context of the two-parameter quantum
Cram\'er-Rao lower bound on the variances of the displacement parameters. We
show that the accessible information about the displacement for a grid state
increases with the number of photons in the state when we measure and prepare
the state using a phase estimation protocol. This is in contrast with the
accessible information in the quantum compass state which we show is always
upper bounded by a constant, independent of the number of photons. We present

probabilities $p_{j}>0$ with $\sum p_{j}=1$. We are interested in the
self-similar measure $\mu =\sum p_{j}\mu \circ S_{j}^{-1}$, of finite type. In
this paper we study the multi-fractal analysis of such measures, extending the
theory to measures arising from non-regular probabilities and whose support is
not necessarily an interval.
  Under some mild technical assumptions, we prove that there exists a subset of
supp$\mu $ of full $\mu $ and Hausdorff measure, called the truly essential
class, for which the set of (upper or lower) local dimensions is a closed
interval. Within the truly essential class we show that there exists a point
with local dimension exactly equal to the dimension of the support. We give an
example where the set of local dimensions is a two element set, with all the
elements of the truly essential class giving the same local dimension. We give
general criteria for these measures to be absolutely continuous with respect to
the associated Hausdorff measure of their support and we show that the
dimension of the support can be computed using only information about the
essential class.
  To conclude, we present a detailed study of three examples. First, we show
that the set of local dimensions of the biased Bernoulli convolution with
contraction ratio the inverse of a simple Pisot number always admits an
isolated point. We give a precise description of the essential class of a
generalized Cantor set of finite type. Lastly, we study a maximal loop class
that is not truly essential.

Majorana zero mode in condensed matter systems. Here we show that the spin
polarization density of a Majorana zero mode, computed as an average of the
spin operator over its wave function, vanishes everywhere. A single
non-degenerate Majorana zero mode, therefore, does not couple to an applied
magnetic field, except via hybridization with higher energy excited states (if
present), which may perturb its wave function. If `spin' is defined by
considering only the particle components of the wave function, as has been done
in some recent works, Majorana zero modes do have a non-zero spatial profile of
this quantity, measurable in scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) experiments.
However, if such a quantity is measured in spin-resolved tunneling experiments
(without spatial resolution), we show that it cannot be used as a unique
signature of Majorana zero modes in the topologically non-trivial
superconducting phase. As a byproduct, we show that in spatially inhomogeneous
systems, accidental zero energy modes, which for all practical purposes behave
as Majorana zero modes (including giving rise to a zero bias conductance peak
of height 2e^2/h), can appear with increasing magnetic field even in the
absence of a topological quantum phase transition (TQPT). But only after gap
closing and the associated TQPT, the modes are localized near the system edges,
resulting in the maximum topological protection. In the light of these
considerations, demonstrating the nonlocal character of the
topologically-protected Majorana pair and its emergence {\em after} the systems
undergo a TQPT, become critical tasks for the ongoing experimental search for
Majorana bound states in condensed matter systems.

different ways to set up the radiative transfer in order to produce realistic

positions. No such counterparts are detected, and we set a 5 sigma upper limit
for low-frequency radio emission of ~1E37 erg/s for progenitors at 20 Mpc. If
the neutrino sources are instead not in nearby galaxies, but originate in
binary neutron star coalescences, our limits place the progenitors at z > 0.2.
While it is possible, due to the high background from atmospheric neutrinos,
that neither event is astrophysical, the MWA observations are nevertheless
among the first to follow up neutrino candidates in the radio, and illustrate
the promise of wide-field instruments like MWA to detect electromagnetic
counterparts to such events.

possessing any measurable magnetic moment. By focusing on the normal state of
227 iridates, described by a parabolic semimetal with quadratic band touching,
we use renormalization group analysis, mean-field theory, and phenomenological
Landau theory as three complementary methods to construct a global phase
diagram in the presence of generic local interactions among itinerant electrons
of Ir ions. While the global phase diagram supports several competing
multipolar orders, motivated by the phenomenology of 227 iridates we
particularly emphasize the competition between AIAO and SI orders and how it
can cause a mixed phase with ""three-in one-out"" (3I1O) spin configurations. In
terms of topological properties of Weyl quasiparticles of the 3I1O state, we
provide an explanation for the magnitude and the direction of the observed AHE
in Pr$_2$Ir$_2$O$_7$. We propose a strain induced enhancement of the onset

Using a simple model of the Galaxy with a disk, bulge, and a spherical dark
matter halo, we show that a nearly circular orbit, highly inclined with respect
to the disk, can be found that fits the positions, orientations, and distances
of both streams. While the two streams are somewhat misaligned in the sense
that they do not occupy the same plane, nodal precession due to the Milky Way
disk potential naturally brings the orbit into line with each stream in the
course of half an orbit. We consequently consider a common origin for the two
streams as plausible. Based on our best fitting orbit, we make predictions for
the positions, distances, radial velocities, and proper motions along each
stream. If our hypothesis is borne out by measurements, then at ~183 degrees
(~235 degrees with respect to the Galactic center) and ~76 kpc in length,
Phoenix-Hermus would become the longest cold stream yet found. This would make
it a particularly valuable new probe of the shape and mass of the Galactic halo

knowledge of all possible sources of contamination. Amongst other sources,
binary stars can introduce systematic biases in the kinematics. Using a set of
Monte Carlo cluster simulations with different concentrations and binary
fractions, we investigate the effect of unresolved binaries on proper-motion
dispersion profiles, treating the simulations like HST proper-motion samples.
Since globular clusters evolve towards a state of partial energy equipartition,
more massive stars lose energy and decrease their velocity dispersion. As a
consequence, on average, binaries have a lower velocity dispersion, since they
are more massive kinematic tracers. We show that, in the case of clusters with
high binary fraction (initial binary fraction of 50%) and high concentration
(i.e., closer to energy equipartition), unresolved binaries introduce a
color-dependent bias in the velocity dispersion of main-sequence stars of the
order of 0.1-0.3 km s$^{-1}$ (corresponding to $1-6$% of the velocity
dispersion), with the reddest stars having a lower velocity dispersion, due to
the higher fraction of contaminating binaries. This bias depends on the ability
to distinguish binaries from single stars, on the details of the
color-magnitude diagram and the photometric errors. We apply our analysis to
the HSTPROMO data set of NGC 7078 (M15) and show that no effect ascribable to
binaries is observed, consistent with the low binary fraction of the cluster.
Our work indicates that binaries do not significantly bias proper-motion
velocity-dispersion profiles, but should be taken into account in the error
budget of kinematic analyses.

with the SFR(H$\alpha$,H$\beta$) values corrected for dust attenuation using
Balmer decrements. The two SFRs agree with a scatter of 0.17 dex. Our results
imply that the Balmer decrement accurately predicts the obscuration of the
nebular lines and can be used to robustly calculate SFRs for star-forming
galaxies at z~2 with SFRs up to $\sim200\,\textrm{M}_\odot\,\mathrm{yr^{-1}}$.
We also use our data to assess SFR indicators based on modeling the
UV-to-mid-IR SEDs or by adding SFR(UV) and SFR(IR), for which the latter is
based on the mid-IR only or on the full IR SED. All these SFRs show a poorer
agreement with SFR(H$\alpha$,H$\beta$) and in some cases large systematic

using the two-point correlation function. However, this statistic does not
capture the topology of the distribution, and it is necessary to resort to
higher order correlations to break degeneracies. We demonstrate that an
alternate approach using network analysis can discriminate between
topologically different distributions that have similar two-point correlations.
We investigate two galaxy point distributions, one produced by a cosmological
simulation and the other by a L\'evy walk. For the cosmological simulation, we
adopt the redshift $z = 0.58$ slice from Illustris (Vogelsberger et al. 2014A)
and select galaxies with stellar masses greater than $10^8$$M_\odot$. The two
point correlation function of these simulated galaxies follows a single
power-law, $\xi(r) \sim r^{-1.5}$. Then, we generate L\'evy walks matching the
correlation function and abundance with the simulated galaxies. We find that,
while the two simulated galaxy point distributions have the same abundance and
two point correlation function, their spatial distributions are very different;
most prominently, \emph{filamentary structures}, absent in L\'evy fractals. To
quantify these missing topologies, we adopt network analysis tools and measure
diameter, giant component, and transitivity from networks built by a
conventional friends-of-friends recipe with various linking lengths. Unlike the
abundance and two point correlation function, these network quantities reveal a
clear separation between the two simulated distributions; therefore, the galaxy
distribution simulated by Illustris is not a L\'evy fractal quantitatively. We
find that the described network quantities offer an efficient tool for
discriminating topologies and for comparing observed and theoretical
distributions.

the electron-electron thermal resistivity which is found to be of comparable

realistic models, fully incorporating the time-dependent nature of the systems.
Here we aim at analysing the fractions of chaotic motion within different
morphological components of the galaxy. We wish to investigate how the presence
of chaotic orbits evolves with time, and how their spatial distribution is
associated with morphological features of the galaxy. We employ a
time-dependent analytical potential model that was derived from an N-body

follow the dynamical evolution of ensembles of orbits. Using the Generalized
Alignment Index (GALI) chaos detection method, we study the fraction of chaotic
orbits, sampling the dynamics of both the stellar disc and of the dark matter
halo. Within the stellar disc, the global trend is for chaotic motion to
decrease in time, specially in the region of the bar. We scrutinized the
different changes of regime during the evolution (orbits that are permanently
chaotic, permanently regular, those that begin regular and end chaotic, and
those that begin chaotic and end regular), tracing the types of orbits back to
their common origins. Within the dark matter halo, chaotic motion also
decreases globally in time. The inner halo (r < 5 kpc) is where most chaotic
orbits are found and it is the only region where chaotic orbits outnumber
regular orbits, in the early evolution.

correctly captured by our RG. If this is correct beyond our approximations,

By implementing a set of pruning heuristics, TTC allows users to limit the

C+ column as a function of the cloud (hydrogen) density, the far-UV field
intensity, and metallicity, encompassing the wide range of galaxy conditions.
When assuming the typical relation between UV and density in the cold neutral
medium, the C+ column becomes a function of the metallicity alone. We verify
our analysis with detailed numerical PDR models. For optically thick gas, most
of the C+ column is mixed with hydrogen that is primarily molecular (H2), and
this ""C+/H2"" gas layer accounts for almost all of the `CO-dark' molecular gas
in PDRs. The C+/H2 column density is limited by dust shielding and is inversely
proportional to the metallicity down to ~0.1 solar. At lower metallicities, H2
line blocking dominates and the C+/H2 column saturates. Applying our theory to
CO surveys in low redshift spirals we estimate the fraction of C+/H2 gas out of
the total molecular gas to be typically ~0.4. At redshifts 1<z<3 in massive
disc galaxies the C+/H2 gas represents a very small fraction of the total
molecular gas (<0.16). This small fraction at high redshifts is due to the high
gas surface densities when compared to local galaxies.

links this exotic structure to the usual hyperbolic one. The resulting identity
is intimately connected with the scattering of plane waves in piecewise

reionization of the Universe, yet direct detection of their escaping ionizing
(Lyman continuum) photons has proven to be extremely challenging. In this
study, we search for escaping Lyman continuum of the Cosmic Horseshoe, a
gravitationally lensed, star-forming galaxy at z=2.38 with a large
magnification of $\sim24$. Transmission at wavelengths of low ionization
interstellar absorption lines in the rest-frame ultraviolet suggest a patchy,
partially transparent interstellar medium. This makes it an ideal candidate for
direct detection of the Lyman continuum. We obtained a 10-orbit Hubble near-UV
image using the WFC3/UVIS F275W filter that probes wavelengths just below the
Lyman limit at the redshift of the Horseshoe in an attempt to detect escaping
Lyman continuum radiation. After fully accounting for the uncertainties in the
opacity of the intergalactic medium as well as accounting for the charge
transfer inefficiency in the WFC3 CCDs, we find a $3 \sigma$ upper-limit for
the relative escape fraction of $f_{esc,rel}<0.08$. This value is a factor of
five lower than the value (0.4) predicted by the 40\% transmission in the
low-ion absorption lines. We discuss the possible causes for this discrepancy
and consider the implications for future attempts at both direct Lyman
continuum detection as well as indirect estimates of the escape fraction.

quantized Hall resistance when the surface states are magnetized. The surface
Dirac states become gapped everywhere on the surface, but chiral edge states
remain on the edges. In an applied current, the edge states produce a quantized
Hall resistance that equals the Chern number C = +1 or -1 (in natural units),
even in zero magnetic field. This quantum anomalous Hall effect was observed by
Chang et al. With reversal of the magnetic field, the system is trapped in a
metastable state because of magnetic anisotropy. Here we investigate how the
system escapes the metastable state at low temperatures (10-200 mK). When the
dissipation (measured by the longitudinal resistance) is ultralow, we find that
the system escapes by making a few, very rapid transitions, as detected by
large jumps in the Hall and longitudinal resistances. Using the field at which
the initial jump occurs to estimate the escape rate, we find that raising the
temperature strongly suppresses the rate. From a detailed map of the resistance
vs. gate voltage and temperature, we show that dissipation strongly affects the
escape rate. We compare the observations with dissipative quantum tunneling
predictions. In the ultralow dissipation regime, there exist two temperature
scales T1 = 70 mK and T2 = 145 mK between which jumps can be observed. The
jumps display a spatial correlation that extends over a large fraction of the
sample.

the azimuthal angles $\phi_{1,2}^{}$ of the two jets measured from the
production plane of the Higgs boson pair and the difference between these two
angles $\phi_1^{}-\phi_2^{}$, and a very small correlation in the sum of them
$\phi_1^{}+\phi_2^{}$. The impact of using a finite top mass $m_t^{}$ value on
the correlations is found crucial. The transverse momentum of the Higgs boson
can be used to enhance or suppress the correlations. The impact of a
non-standard value for the triple Higgs self-coupling on the correlations is
found much smaller than that on other observables, such as the invariant mass
of the two Higgs bosons. The peak shifts of the azimuthal angle distributions
reflect the magnitude of parity violation in the $gg\to HH$ amplitude and the
dependence of the distributions on parity violating phases is analytically
clarified. The WBF sub-process also produces correlated distributions and it is
found that they are not induced by the quantum effect of the intermediate weak
bosons but mainly by a kinematic effect. This kinematic effect is a
characteristic feature of the WBF sub-process and is not observed in the GF
sub-process. It is found that the correlations are different in the GF and in
the WBF sub-processes. As part of the process dependent information, they will
be helpful in the analyses of both the GF sub-process and the WBF sub-process

the distortion depends only on $|K|$, rather than on $|X|$.
  We also strengthen this notion, and consider embeddings that approximately

having a convective core. We first test and validate a seismic diagnostic that
was proposed to probe in a model-dependent way the extent of convective cores
using the so-called $r_{010}$ ratios, which are built with $l=0$ and $l=1$
modes. We apply this procedure to 24 low-mass stars chosen among Kepler targets
to optimize the efficiency of this diagnostic. For this purpose, we compute
grids of stellar models with both the CESAM2k and MESA evolution codes, where
the extensions of convective cores are modeled either by an instantaneous
mixing or as a diffusion process. Among the selected targets, we are able to
unambiguously detect convective cores in eight stars and we obtain seismic
measurements of the extent of the mixed core in these targets with a good
agreement between the CESAM2k and MESA codes. By performing optimizations using
the Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm, we then obtain estimates of the amount of
extra-mixing beyond the core that is required in CESAM2k to reproduce seismic
observations for these eight stars and we show that this can be used to propose
a calibration of this quantity. This calibration depends on the prescription
chosen for the extra-mixing, but we find that it should be valid also for the
code MESA, provided the same prescription is used. This study constitutes a
first step towards the calibration of the extension of convective cores in
low-mass stars, which will help reduce the uncertainties on the ages of these
stars.

particle swarming in a viscous fluid environment. Our model predicts emergent
collective behavior that depends critically on fluid opacity, mechanism of
self-propulsion, and type of particle-particle interaction. In ""clear fluids""
swimmers have full knowledge of their surroundings and can adjust their
velocities with respect to the lab frame, while in ""opaque fluids,"" they
control their velocities only in relation to the local fluid flow. We also show
that ""social"" interactions that affect only a particle's propensity to swim
towards or away from neighbors induces a flow field that is qualitatively
different from the long-ranged flow fields generated by direct ""physical""
interactions. The latter can be short-ranged but lead to much longer-ranged
fluid-mediated hydrodynamic forces, effectively amplifying the range over which
particles interact. These different fluid flows conspire to profoundly affect
swarm morphology, kinetically stabilizing or destabilizing swarm configurations
that would arise in the absence of fluid. Depending upon the overall
interaction potential, the mechanism of swimming (e.g., pushers or pullers),
and the degree of fluid opaqueness, we discover a number of new collective
three-dimensional patterns including flocks with prolate or oblate shapes,
recirculating peloton-like structures, and jet-like fluid flows that entrain
particles mediating their escape from the center of mill-like structures. Our
results reveal how the interplay among general physical elements influence
fluid-mediated interactions and the self-organization, mobility, and stability
of new three-dimensional swarms and suggest how they might be used to
kinetically control their collective behavior.

multicarrier communication systems performance by dynamically adapting the
transmission parameters, i.e., transmit power and number of bits per
subcarrier, to the changing quality of the wireless link. The research
literature has focused on single objective optimization techniques to optimize
the multicarrier communication systems performance, e.g., maximizing the
throughput/capacity or minimizing the transmit power subject to a set of
constraints. In this dissertation, we adopt a novel optimization concept,
namely multiobjective optimization, where our objective is to simultaneously
optimize the conflicting and incommensurable throughput and power objectives.
  More specifically, in some of the following Chapters, we propose novel
algorithms that jointly maximize the multicarrier system throughput and
minimize its total transmit power subject to quality-of-service, total transmit
power, and maximum allocated bits per subcarrier constraints. The proposed
algorithms require prior knowledge about the importance of the competing
objective functions in terms of pre-determined weighting coefficients, or they
can adapt the weighting coefficients during the solution process while meeting
the constraints, in order to reduce the computational complexity. Simulation
results show significant performance gains in terms of the achieved throughput
and transmit power when compared to single optimization approaches, at the cost
of no additional complexity.

thus important to study the effects that an episodic central engine has on the
jet propagation and, eventually, on the prompt emission within the collapsar
scenario. Thus, in this study we follow the interaction of pulsed outflows with
their progenitor stars with hydrodynamic numerical simulations in both two and
three dimensions. We show that the propagation of unsteady jets is affected by
the interaction with the progenitor material well after the break-out time,
especially for jets with long quiescent times, comparable to or larger than a
second. We also show that this interaction can lead to an asymmetric behavior
in which pulse durations and quiescent periods are systematically different.
After the pulsed jets drill through the progenitor and the interstellar medium,
we find that, on average, the quiescent epochs last longer than the pulses
(even in simulations with symmetrical active and quiescent engine times). This
could explain the asymmetry detected in the light curves of long-quiescent
times duration gamma-ray bursts.

adjustment for movement from cerebellum in human, are generated and updated

of quantum optics. Afterpulsing effect, which is an intrinsic character of
SPAD, affects the system performance in most of the experiments and needs to be
carefully handled. For a long time, afterpulsing has been presumed to be
determined by the pre-ignition avalanche. We studied the afterpulsing effect of
a commercial InGaAs/InP SPAD (APD: Princeton Lightwave PGA-300) and
demonstrated that its afterpulsing is non-Markov, which has memory effect of
the avalanching history. Theoretical analysis and the experimental results
clearly indicate that the embodiment of this memory effect is the afterpulsing
probability, which increases as the number of ignition-avalanche pulses
increase. The conclusion makes the principle of afterpulsing effect clearer and
is instructive to the manufacturing processes and afterpulsing evaluation of
high-count-rate SPADs. It can also be regarded as an fundamental premise to
handle the afterpulsing signals in many applications, such as quantum
communication and quantum random number generator.

of a single B-type star to many O-type stars. For all the bubbles, we
investigated relationships between the radius, luminosities and luminosity

follow a power-law relation with an index of $\sim$3 between the total IR
luminosity and radius, as expected from the conventional picture of the

problem of most fundamental importance. In this problem, given a directed
graph, each vertex represents a user with a need of information, and the
neighborhood of each vertex represents the side information availability to
that user. The aim is to find an encoding to minimum number of bits (optimal
rate) that, when broadcasted, will be sufficient to the need of every user. Not
only the optimal rate is intractable, but it is also very hard to characterize
with some other well-studied graph parameter or with a simpler formulation,
such as a linear program. Recently there have been a series of works that
address this question and provide explicit schemes for index coding as the
optimal value of a linear program with rate given by well-studied properties
such as local chromatic number or partial clique-covering number. There has
been a recent attempt to combine these existing notions of local chromatic
number and partial clique covering into a unified notion denoted as the local
partial clique cover (Arbabjolfaei and Kim, 2014).
  We present a generalized novel upper-bound (encoding scheme) - in the form of
the minimum value of a linear program - for optimal index coding. Our bound
also combines the notions of local chromatic number and partial clique covering
into a new definition of the local partial clique cover, which outperforms both
the previous bounds, as well as beats the previous attempt to combination.
  Further, we look at the upper bound derived recently by Thapa et al., 2015,

perturbation theory, we study the finite temperature phase diagram of a
half-depleted periodic Anderson model on the honeycomb lattice at half filling
for a model of graphone, i.e., single-side hydrogenated graphene. The ground
state of this model is found to be ferromagnetic (FM) semi-metal. The spin wave
dispersion in the FM state is linear in momentum at zero temperature but
becomes quadratic at finite temperatures, implying that the FM state is fragile
against thermal fluctuations. Indeed, our VCA calculations find that the
paramagnetic (PM) state dominates the finite temperature phase diagram. More
surprisingly, we find that massless Dirac quasiparticles with the linear energy
dispersion emerge at the Fermi energy upon introducing the electron correlation
$U$ at the impurity sites in the PM phase. The Dirac Fermi velocity is found to
be highly correlated to the quasiparticle weight of the emergent massless Dirac
quasiparticles at the Fermi energy and monotonically increases with $U$. These
unexpected massless Dirac quasiparticles are also examined with the Hubbard-I
approximation and the origin is discussed in terms of the spectral weight
redistribution involving a large energy scale of $U$. Considering an effective
quasiparticle Hamiltonian which reproduces the single-particle excitations
obtained by the Hubbard-I approximation, we argue that the massless Dirac
quasiparticles are protected by the electron correlation. Our finding is
therefore the first example of the emergence of massless Dirac quasiparticles
due to dynamical electron correlations without breaking any spatial symmetry.
The experimental implications of our results for graphone as well as a graphene
sheet on transition metal substrates are also briefly discussed.

is phase encoded in the prepared state in a $2^n$-dimensional Hilbert space in
the form $(|i\rangle\pm|j\rangle)/\sqrt{2}$ with $n\ge 2$. For each qudit
prepared and measured in the same two-dimensional Hilbert subspace, one bit of
raw secret key is obtained in the absence of transmission error. Here we show
that by modifying the basis announcement procedure, the same experimental setup
can generate $n$ bits of raw key for each qudit prepared and measured in the
same basis in the noiseless situation. The reason is that in addition to the
phase information, each qudit also carries information on the Hilbert subspace
used. The additional $(n-1)$ bits of raw key comes from a clever utilization of
this extra piece of information. We prove the unconditional security of this
modified protocol and compare its performance with other existing provably
secure qubit- and qudit-based protocols on market in the one-way classical
communication setting. Interestingly, we find that for the case of $n=2$, the
secret key rate of this modified protocol using non-degenerate random quantum
code to perform one-way entanglement distillation is equal to that of the

combinatorial problems like bipartite matching, maximum coverage, min-cost
flow, packing problems, etc. Our main result shows that equilibrium computation
in security games is essentially a combinatorial problem. In particular, we
prove that, for any set system $E$, the following problems can be reduced to
each other in polynomial time: (0) combinatorial optimization over $E$, (1)
computing the minimax equilibrium for zero-sum security games over $E$, (2)
computing the strong Stackelberg equilibrium for security games over $E$, (3)
computing the best or worst (for the defender) Nash equilibrium for security
games over $E$. Here, by ""games over $E$"" we mean the class of security games
with arbitrary payoff structures, but a fixed set $E$ of defender pure
strategies. This shows that the complexity of a security game is essentially
determined by the set system $E$.

masses, M$_{\rm HI}$$<$10$^{8}h^{-2}$M$_{\odot}$, are affected by host dark
matter halo mass and photoionisation feedback from the UV background after the
end of reionization. We study how the physical processes governing the

neutral hydrogen in the Universe using the hierarchical galaxy formation model,
GALFORM. We calculate the effect on the correlation function of changing the HI
mass detection threshold at redshifts $0 \le z \le 0.5$. We parameterize the
clustering as $\xi(r)=(r/r_{0})^{-\gamma}$ and we find that including galaxies
with M$_{\rm HI}$$<$10$^{8}h^{-2}$M$_{\odot}$ increases the clustering
amplitude $r_{0}$ and slope $\gamma$ compared to samples of higher HI masses.
This is due to these galaxies with low HI masses typically being hosted by
haloes with masses greater than 10$^{12}{h}^{-1}$M$_{\odot}$, and is in
contrast to optically selected surveys for which the inclusion of faint, blue
galaxies lowers the clustering amplitude. We show the HI mass function for
different host dark matter halo masses and galaxy types (central or satellite)
to interpret the values of $r_{0}$ and $\gamma$ of the clustering of
HI-selected galaxies. We also predict the contribution of low HI mass galaxies
to the 21cm intensity mapping signal. We calculate that a dark matter halo mass

unsatisfactory. The BAO analysis following a full RSD modelling is contaminated
by systematic uncertainties due to a non-linear smearing effects such as
non-linear corrections and by random viral velocity of galaxies. However, the
BAO can be probed independently of RSD contamination using the BAO peak
positions located in the 2D anisotropic correlation function. A new methodology
is presented to measure peak positions, to test whether it is also contaminated

both the density of vibrational states (DOVS) and force network evolve
progressively with the shear stress. There exists a packing fraction
independent shear stress $\sigma_c$, at which the shear-driven solids are
isostatic and have a flattened DOVS. Solid-like states induced by a shear
stress greater than $\sigma_c$ possess properties of marginally jammed solids
and are thus strictly-defined shear jammed states. Below $\sigma_c$, states at
all packing fractions are under isostaticity and share common features in the

suggested to improve the representation of moist convection by making cumulus
parameterizations more sensitive to mid-tropospheric moisture. Climate models
show considerable rainfall biases in coastal tropical areas, where approx. 33 %
of the overall rainfall received is associated with coastal land-sea
interaction. Building on an algorithm to objectively identify rainfall that is
associated with land-sea interaction we investigate whether the relationship
between rainfall in coastal regions and atmospheric humidity differs from that
over the open ocean or over inland areas. We combine 3-hourly satellite
estimates of rainfall with humidity estimates from reanalyses and investigate
if coastal rainfall reveals the well known relationship between area-averaged
precipitation and column integrated moisture. We find that rainfall that is
associated with coastal land-sea effects occurs under much drier
mid-tropospheric conditions than that over the ocean and doesn't exhibit a
pronounced critical value of humidity. In addition, the dependence of the
amount of rainfall on mid-tropospheric moisture is significantly weaker when
the rainfall is coastally influenced. Our findings indicate that the
representation of convection in weather and climate models must cater for the
special character near coasts rather than rely on a common set of rules across
the globe.

Photon-based quantum simulators have great advantages due to the possibility of
direct measurements of multi-particle correlations and ease of simulating
non-equilibrium physics. However, interparticle interaction in existing
photonic systems is often too weak limiting the potential of quantum
simulation. Here we propose an approach to enhance the interparticle
interaction using exciton-polaritons in MoS$_2$ monolayer quantum-dots embedded
in 2D photonic crystal microcavities. Realistic calculation yields optimal
repulsive interaction in the range of $1$-$10$~meV --- more than an order of
magnitude greater than the state-of-art value. Such strong repulsive
interaction is found to emerge neither in the photon-blockade regime for small
quantum dot nor in the polariton-blockade regime for large quantum dot, but in
the crossover between the two regimes with a moderate quantum-dot radius around
20~nm. The optimal repulsive interaction is found to be largest in MoS$_2$
among commonly used optoelectronic materials. Quantum simulation of strongly
correlated many-body systems in a finite chain of coupled cavities and its
experimental signature are studied via exact diagonalization of the many-body
Hamiltonian. A method to simulate 1D superlattices for interacting
exciton-polariton gases in serially coupled cavities is also proposed.

gas is located at a distance of 48 - 65 pc from the nucleus, and that the
kinetic luminosity of the outflow is 10^44-10^46 erg s^-1. J1634+2049 has a
off-centered galactic ring on the scale of ~ 30 kpc that is proved to be formed
by a recent head-on collision by a nearby galaxy. Thus this quasar is a
valuable object in the transitional phase emerging out of dust enshrouding as
depicted by the co-evolution scenario.

centred at a pole of spherically symmetric manifolds. We first derive a
Hadamard--type formula for the dependence of the first eigenvalue $\lambda_{1}$
on the radius $r$ of the ball, which allows us to obtain lower and upper bounds
for $\lambda_{1}$ in specific cases. For the sphere and hyperbolic space, these
bounds are asymptotically sharp as $r$ approaches zero and we see that while in
two dimensions $\lambda_{1}$ is bounded from above by the first two terms in
the asymptotics for small $r$, for dimensions four and higher the reverse
inequality holds.
  In the general case we derive the asymptotic expansion of $\lambda_{1}$ for
small radius and determine the first three terms explicitly. For compact
manifolds we carry out similar calculations as the radius of the geodesic ball
approaches the diameter of the manifold. In the latter case we show that in
even dimensions there will always exist logarithmic terms in these expansions.

baryogenesis in the presence of anisotropy, which is produced at the end of an
anisotropic inflation. Although we confirm that the generated baryon asymmetry
is enhanced compared with the original isotropic cosmological model, taking

galaxy Arakelian 564 (Ark 564). These observations, separated by ~6 days, allow
us to look for correlations between the simultaneous UV emission (from the
Optical Monitor) with not only the X-ray flux but also with the different X-ray
spectral parameters. The X-ray spectra from all the observations are found to
be adequately fitted by a double Comptonization model where the soft excess and
the hard X-ray power law are represented by thermal Comptonization in a low
temperature plasma and hot corona, respectively. Apart from the fluxes of each
component, the hard X-ray power law index is found to be variable. These
results suggest that the variability is associated with changes in the geometry
of the inner region. The UV emission is found to be variable and well
correlated with the high energy index while the correlations with the fluxes of
each component are found to be weaker. Using viscous time-scale arguments we
rule out the possibility that the UV variation is due to fluctuating accretion
rate in the outer disc. If the UV variation is driven by X-ray reprocessing,
then our results indicate that the strength of the X-ray reprocessing depends
more on the geometry of the X-ray producing inner region rather than on the
X-ray luminosity alone.

Large Millimetre/sub-millimetre Array (ALMA) calls for analysis methods making
the best of them. Reconstructing in space the morphology and kinematics of
radio sources is an underdetermined problem that requires imposing additional
constraints for its solution. The hypothesis of rotational invariance about a
well-defined star axis, which is a good approximation to the description of the
gas envelopes of many evolved stars and protostars, is particularly efficient
in this role. In the first part of the article, a systematic use of simulated
observations allows for identifying the main problems and for constructing
quantities aimed at solving them. In particular the evaluation of the
orientation of the star axis in space and the differentiation between expansion
along the star axis and rotation about it are given special attention. The use
of polar rather than Cartesian sky coordinates is shown to better match the
morphology and kinematics of actual stars. The radial dependence of the gas
density and temperature and the possible presence of velocity gradients are
briefly considered. In the second part, the results obtained in the first part
are applied to a few stars taken as examples with the aim of evaluating their
usefulness when applied to concrete cases. A third part takes stock of what
precedes and formulates some guidelines for modelling the radio emission of
axisymmetric radio sources, limited however to the mathematics and geometry of
the problem, physics considerations being ignored.

conductance greater than the conductance quantum $2e^{2}/h$ at zero bias, which
indicates the presence of Andreev-reflected quasiparticles, time-reversed

sensitivity of the conductance enhancement to voltage bias and perpendicular
magnetic field suggests a mechanism analogous to reflectionless tunneling--a
hallmark of phase-coherent transport, with the boundary of the 2DEG cavity
playing the role of scatters. When the QPC transmission is reduced to the
tunneling regime, the differential conductance vs bias voltage probes the
single-particle density of states in the proximity area. Measured conductance
spectra show a double peak within the superconducting gap of Nb, demonstrating
the formation of Andreev bound states in the 2DEG. Both of these results,
obtained in the open and closed geometries, underpin the coherent nature of

examine the possibility that the apparent alignment arises from an underlying

hybrid algorithm is proposed by combination of a hybrid algorithm of the
Particle Swarm Optimization and Differential Evolution (DE), and the linear
matrix inequality method. The proposed algorithm is used to solve a
optimization problem with a bi-linear matrix inequality constraints. The
Particle Swarm Optimization-DE hybrid algorithm was used to obtain a population
of controllers, and linear matrix inequality approach was used to optimize a
performance criterion of the system. Taking a hybrid H 2/H infinite control
problem as example, the detailed algorithm is presented to solve robust static
output feedback control problem. The simulation results show that the proposed
hybrid algorithm improves the convergence rate and accuracy of iterative
methods and the original DE-linear matrix inequality algorithm.

schemes is carried out in the configuration of a spatially developing turbulent
boundary layer (TBL). One control is designed to damp near-wall turbulence and
the other induces constant mass flux in the wall-normal direction. Both control
schemes yield similar local drag reduction rates within the control region.
However, the flow development downstream of the control significantly differs:
persistent drag reduction is found for the uniform blowing case whereas drag
increase is found for the turbulence damping case. In order to account for this
difference the formulation of a global drag reduction rate is suggested. It
represents the reduction of the streamwise force exerted by the fluid on a
finite length plate. Furthermore, it is shown that the far downstream
development of the TBL after the control region can be described by a single
quantity, namely a streamwise shift of the uncontrolled boundary layer, i.e. a
changed virtual origin. Based on this result, a simple model is developed that
allows relating for the local drag reduction rate to the global one without the
need of conducting expensive simulations or measurements far downstream of the
control region.

fractal regime} is a definite range in the photon momentum-transfer $q$, which
is characterized by the scaling-law behavior of the structure factor: $S(q)
\propto 1/q^{d_f}$. This allows a straightforward estimation of the fractal
dimension $d_f$ of aggregates in {\it Small-Angle X-ray Scattering} (SAXS)
experiments. However, this behavior is not commonly studied in optical
scattering experiments because of the lack of information on its domain of
validity. In the present work, we propose a definition of the
multiple-scattering structure factor, which naturally generalizes the
single-scattering function $S(q)$. We show that the mean-field theory of
electromagnetic scattering provides an explicit condition to interpret the
significance of multiple scattering. In this paper, we investigate and discuss
electromagnetic scattering by three classes of fractal aggregates. The results
obtained from the TMatrix method show that the fractal scaling range is divided
into two domains: 1) a genuine fractal regime, which is robust; 2) a possible
anomalous scaling regime, $S(q) \propto 1/q^{\delta}$, with exponent $\delta$
independent of $d_f$, and related to the way the scattering mechanism uses the
local morphology of the scatterer. The recognition, and an analysis, of the
latter domain is of importance because it may result in significant reduction
of the fractal regime, and brings into question the proper mechanism in the
build-up of multiple-scattering.

a novel generalization of Virasoro in higher dimensions. The central charge of
the algebra is proportional to the entropy of the corresponding extremal black

Applying this statistic, we construct banks of both aligned- and generic-spin
templates for binary black holes and neutron-star--black-hole binaries, and
compare the effectualness of these banks towards simulated populations of
generic-spin systems. We then use these banks in a pipeline analysis of
Gaussian noise to measure the increase in background incurred by using generic-
instead of aligned-spin banks. Although the generic-spin banks have a factor of
ten to twenty more templates than the aligned-spin banks, we find an overall
improvement in signal recovery at fixed false-alarm rate for systems with
high-mass ratio and highly precessing spins ---up to 60\% for
neutron-star--black-hole mergers. This gain in sensitivity comes at a small
loss of sensitivity ($\lesssim$4\%) for systems that are already well-covered
by aligned-spin templates. Since the observation of even a single binary merger
with misalinged spins could provide unique astrophysical insights into the
formation of these sources, we recommend that the method described here be
developed further to mount a viable search for generic-spin binary mergers in

blow-up method we provide a detailed description of the periodicity of the
earthquake episodes. In particular, the limit cycles arise from a degenerate
Hopf bifurcation whose degeneracy is due to an underlying Hamiltonian structure
that leads to large amplitude oscillations. We use a Poincar\'e
compactification to study the system near infinity. At infinity the critical
manifold loses hyperbolicity with an exponential rate. We use an adaptation of
the blow-up method to recover the hyperbolicity. This enables the
identification of a new attracting manifold that organises the dynamics at
infinity. This in turn leads to the formulation of a conjecture on the
behaviour of the limit cycles as the time-scale separation increases. We
illustrate our findings with numerics and suggest an outline of the proof of
this conjecture.

important issue in biology. While numerous experiments have revealed details of
the molecular structure and working mechanism of DNAP which consists of both a
polymerase site and an exonuclease (proofreading) site, there were quite few
theoretical studies on the fidelity issue. The first model which explicitly
considered both sites was proposed in 1970s' and the basic idea was widely
accepted by later models. However, all these models did not systematically and
rigorously investigate the dominant factor on DNAP fidelity, i.e, the
higher-order terminal effects through which the polymerization pathway and the
proofreading pathway coordinate to achieve high fidelity. In this paper, we
propose a new and comprehensive kinetic model of DNAP based on some recent
experimental observations, which includes previous models as special cases. We
present a rigorous and unified treatment of the corresponding steady-state
kinetic equations of any-order terminal effects, and derive analytical
expressions for fidelity in terms of kinetic parameters under bio-relevant
conditions. These expressions offer new insights on how the the higher-order
terminal effects contribute substantially to the fidelity in an order-by-order
way, and also show that the polymerization-and-proofreading mechanism is
dominated only by very few key parameters. We then apply these results to
calculate the fidelity of some real DNAPs, which are in good agreements with
previous intuitive estimates given by experimentalists.

highlights of the new entropy are that it is bounded by finite limits and that
it is non additive in nature. The non additive property of the proposed entropy
makes it useful for the representation of information content in the
non-extensive systems containing some degree of regularity or correlation. The
effectiveness of the proposed entropy in representing the correlated random
variables is demonstrated by applying it for the texture classification problem
since textures found in nature are random and at the same time contain some
degree of correlation or regularity at some scale. The gray level co-occurrence
probabilities (GLCP) are used for computing the entropy function. The
experimental results indicate high degree of the classification accuracy. The
performance of the new entropy function is found superior to other forms of

  2-structures and Tree-representable Systems of Binary Relations",,,,,"cs.DM","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The concepts of orthology, paralogy, and xenology play a key role in
molecular evolution. Orthology and paralogy distinguish whether a pair of genes
originated by speciation or duplication. The corresponding binary relations on
a set of genes form complementary cographs. Allowing more than two types of
ancestral event types leads to symmetric symbolic ultrametrics. Horizontal gene
transfer, which leads to xenologous gene pairs, however, is inherent asymmetric
since one offspring copy ""jumps"" into another genome, while the other continues
to be inherited vertically. We therefore explore here the mathematical
structure of the non-symmetric generalization of symbolic ultrametrics. Our
main results tie non-symmetric ultrametrics together with di-cographs (the
directed generalization of cographs), so-called uniformly non-prime
2-structures, and hierarchical structures on the set of strong modules. This
yields a characterization of relation structures that can be explained in terms
of trees and types of ancestral events. This framework accommodates a
horizontal-transfer relation in terms of an ancestral event and thus, is
slightly different from the the most commonly used definition of xenology.

the effect of using CO or H2 densities to define the GMCs. We find that CO can
reliably trace the high-density H2 gas, but misses less dense H2 clouds. We
also investigate the effect of using 3D CO densities versus CO emission with an
observer's perspective, and find that CO-emission clouds trace well the peaks
of the actual GMCs in 3D, but can miss the lower density molecular gas between
density peaks which is often CO-dark. Thus, the CO emission typically traces
smaller clouds within larger GMC complexes. We also investigate the effect of
the galactic environment (in particular the presence of spiral arms), on the
distribution of GMC properties, and we find that the mean properties are
similar between arm and inter-arm clouds, but the tails of some distributions
are indicative of intrinsic differences in the environment. We find highly
filamentary clouds (similar to the giant molecular filaments of our Galaxy)
exclusively in the inter-arm region, formed by galactic shear. We also find
that the most massive GMC complexes are located in the arm, and that as a
consequence of more frequent cloud interactions/mergers in the arm, arm clouds
are more sub-structured and have higher velocity dispersions than inter-arm
clouds.

such as axisymmetric rings or horseshoe concen- trations evocative of
large-scale vortices. These structures are often interpreted as the result of
planet-disc interactions. However, these disks are also known to be unstable to
the magneto-rotational instability (MRI) which is believed to be one of the
dominant angular momentum transport mechanism in these objects. It is therefore
natural to ask if the MRI itself could produce these structures without
invoking planets. The nonlinear evolution of the MRI is strongly affected by
the low ionisation fraction in protoplanetary disks. The Hall effect in
particular, which is dominant in dense and weakly ionised parts of these
objects, has been shown to spontaneously drive self- organising flows in
shearing box simulations. Here, we investigate the behaviour of global
MRI-unstable disc models dominated by the Hall effect and characterise their
dynamics. We perform 3D unstratified Hall-MHD simulations of keplerian disks
for a broad range of Hall, ohmic and ambipolar Elsasser numbers. We confirm the
transition from a turbulent to an organised state as the intensity of the Hall
effect is increased. We observe the formation of zonal flows, their number
depending on the available magnetic flux and on the intensity of the Hall
effect. For intermediate Hall intensity, the flow self-organises into
long-lived magnetised vortices. Neither the addition of a toroidal field nor
ohmic or ambipolar diffusion drastically change this picture in the range of
parameters we have explored. The ability of these structures to trap dust
particles in this configuration is demonstrated. We conclude that Hall-MRI
driven organisation is a plausible scenario which could explain some of the
structures found in recent observations.

that if the upgrade to HVDC is applied systematically to selected transmission
lines across the grid, a hybrid architecture is obtained that enables an
efficient and globally optimal solution of the optimal power flow (OPF)

prove that after the upgrade to the proposed hybrid architecture, the same mesh

approach can be made much more efficient by correlating the underlying Monte
Carlo (MC) random numbers used to form the estimate of the likelihood at the

speeds up the standard PM algorithm, as it requires a much smaller number of
samples or particles to form the optimal likelihood estimate. Our paper
presents an alternative implementation of the correlated PM approach, called
the block PM, which divides the underlying random numbers into blocks so that
the likelihood estimates for the proposed and current values of the parameters
only differ by the random numbers in one block. We show that this
implementation of the correlated PM can be much more efficient for some
specific problems than the implementation in Deligiannidis et al. (2016); for
example when the likelihood is estimated by subsampling or the likelihood is a
product of terms each of which is given by an integral which can be estimated
unbiasedly by randomised quasi-Monte Carlo. Our article provides methodology
and guidelines for efficiently implementing the block PM. A second advantage of
the the block PM is that it provides a direct way to control the correlation

of two opposite opinions, or are neutral, and exchange opinions in generic
pairwise interactions. We show that when opinions spread in a population where
a fraction of individuals (zealots) maintain unshakably their opinion, one of
four qualitatively distinct kinds of collective dynamics arise, depending on
the specific rules governing the social interactions. Unsurprisingly, when
their density is high, zealots drive the whole population to consensus on their
opinion. For low densities a rich phase diagram emerges: a finite population of
dissenters can survive and be the only stationary state or may need a critical
mass or dissenters to be sustained; the critical mass may vanish or not as the
density is reduced; the transition to the high density regime can be smooth or
abrupt, and shows interesting hysteretic effects. For each choice of the
interaction rules we calculate the critical density of zealots above which
diverse opinions cannot survive.

various processes occurring in the early Universe. Here, we summarize all
guaranteed CMB distortions and assess their total uncertainty within
$\Lambda$CDM. We also compare simple methods for approximating them,
highlighting some of the subtle aspects when it comes to interpreting future
distortion measurements. Under simplified assumptions, we briefly study how
well a PIXIE-like experiment may measure the main distortion parameters (i.e.,
$\mu$ and $y$). Next generation CMB spectrometers are expected to detect the
distortion caused by reionization and structure formation at extremely high
significance. They will also be able to constrain the small-scale power
spectrum through the associated $\mu$-distortion, improving limits on running
of the spectral index. Distortions from the recombination era, adiabatic
cooling of matter relative to the CMB and dark matter annihilation require a
higher sensitivity than PIXIE in its current design. The crucial next step is
an improved modeling of foregrounds and instrumental aspects, as we briefly
discuss here.

contains $k$ pairwise vertex disjoint cycles or a set $T$ of at most $f(k)$
vertices such that $G-T$ is acyclic. The generalisation of this result to
directed graphs is known as Younger's conjecture and was proved by Reed,
Robertson, Seymour and Thomas in 1996. This so-called Erdos-Posa-property can
naturally be generalised to arbitrary graphs and digraphs. Robertson and
Seymour proved that a graph $H$ has the Erdos-Posa-property if, and only if,
$H$ is planar. In this paper we study the corresponding problem for digraphs.
We obtain a complete characterisation of the class of strongly connected
digraphs which have the Erdos-Posa-property (both for topological and butterfly
minors). We also generalise this result to classes of digraphs which are not
strongly connected. In particular, we study the class of vertex-cyclic digraphs
(digraphs without trivial strong components). For this natural class of
digraphs we obtain a nearly complete characterisation of the digraphs within
this class with the Erdos-Posa-property. In particular we give positive and
algorithmic examples of digraphs with the Erdos-Posa-property by using directed
tree decompositions in a novel way.

simultaneously in the chromospheric absorption lines H-alpha and Na I D2.
Physical parameters of the filament plasma were derived using Cloud Model (CM)
inversions and line core fits. The spectra were complemented with full-disk
filtergrams (He I 10830 A, H-alpha, and Ca II K) of the Chromspheric Telescope
(ChroTel) and full-disk magnetograms of HMI. The filament had extremely large
linear dimensions (817""), which corresponds to about 658 Mm along a great
circle on the solar surface. A total amount of 175119 H-alpha contrast profiles
were inverted using the CM approach. The inferred mean line-of-sight (LOS)
velocity, Doppler width, and source function were similar to previous works of
smaller quiescent filaments. However, the derived optical thickness was larger.
LOS velocity trends inferred from the H-alpha line core fits were in accord,
but smaller, than the ones obtained with CM inversions. Signatures of
counter-streaming flows were detected in the filament.The largest conglomerates
of brightenings in the line core of Na I D2 coincided well with small-scale
magnetic fields as seen by HMI. Mixed magnetic polarities were detected close
to the ends of barbs. The computation of photospheric horizontal flows based on
HMI magnetograms revealed flow kernels with a size of 5-8 Mm and velocities of
0.30-0.45 km/s at the ends of the filament. The physical properties of
extremely large filaments are similar to their smaller counterparts, except for
the optical thickness which in our sample was found to be larger. We found that
a part of the filament, which erupted the day before, is in the process of
reestablishing its initial configuration.

excitations can become delocalized when the latter are present. The
delocalization effect exists for both long-range as well as local atomic
interactions.

physics: The evaluation of the partition function and thermodynamic
observables, which involve high dimensional sums of sharply structured
multi-modal density functions. It poses a major challenge to most standard
numerical techniques, such as Markov Chain Monte Carlo. In this paper we will
demonstrate that nested sampling is particularly suited for such problems and
it has a couple of advantages. For calculating the partition function of the
Potts model with $N$ sites: a) one run stops after $O(N)$ moves, so it takes
$O(N^{2})$ operations for the run, b) only a single run is required to compute
the partition function along with the assignment of confidence intervals, c)
the confidence intervals of the logarithmic partition function decrease with
$1/\sqrt{N}$ and d) a single run allows to compute quantities for all
temperatures while the autocorrelation time is very small, irrespective of
temperature. Thermodynamic expectation values of observables, which are
completely determined by the bond configuration in the representation of
Fortuin and Kasteleyn, like the Helmholtz free energy, the internal energy as
well as the entropy and heat capacity, can be calculated in the same single run
needed for the partition function along with their confidence intervals. In
contrast, thermodynamic expectation values of magnetic properties like the
magnetization and the magnetic susceptibility require sampling the additional
spin degree of freedom. Results and performance are studied in detail and
compared with those obtained with multi-canonical sampling. Eventually the
implications of the findings on a parallel implementation of nested sampling
are outlined.

QPI pattern exhibits a dimer structure in the energy region of the SDW gap,
with its orientation along the ferromagnetic direction of the SDW order. When
the energy is increased to be near the Fermi level, it exhibits two sets of
dimers along the same direction. The dimer structure of the QPI patterns
persists with the decrease of the SDW correlation length in the magnetic driven
nematic phase, although it tends to merge together for the scattering patterns
with energies close to the Fermi level. While in the orbital scenario, the QPI
patterns exhibit a dimer structure in a wide energy region. It undergoes a
{\pi}/2 rotation with the increasing of energy, which is associated with the
inequivalent energies of the two Dirac nodes induced by the orbital order.
These distinct features may be used to probe or distinguish two kinds of
scenarios of the nemeticity.

production in fusion reactors. Microscopically, the bursting of He bubbles is a
stochastic process, and He bubbles have statistically average lifetimes. In the

that He bubble bursting can be treated as an activated event. Its occurrence
frequency or, equivalently, the average lifetime of bubbles follows the
Arrhenius equation. For a given bubble size, the activation energy exhibits a
good linear dependence with the depth, and the pre-exponential factor obeys the

itself for example in poorly decaying singular values when using a POD. The
poor decay is counter-intuitive, since a single structure is expected to be

group velocity, a POD or DMD reduces moving structures to a few modes, as
expected. Beyond serving as a reduced model, the resulting entity can be used

eccentricities. Linear secular theory is found to correctly predict the
structure and precession rates of discs with small eccentricities. However,
discs with larger eccentricities (and eccentricity gradients) are observed to
precess faster (retrograde relative to the orbital motion), at a rate that
depends on their eccentricities (and eccentricity gradients). We derive
analytically a nonlinear secular theory for eccentric gas discs, which explains
this result as a modification of the pressure forces whenever eccentric orbits
in a disc nearly intersect. This effect could be particularly important for
highly eccentric discs produced in tidal disruption events, or for narrow
gaseous rings; it might also play a role in causing some of the variability in
superhump binary systems. In two dimensions, the eccentricity of a moderately
eccentric disc is long-lived and persists throughout the duration of our
simulations. Eccentric modes are however weakly damped by their interaction
with non-axisymmetric spiral density waves (driven by the Papaloizou-Pringle

to verify the existence of the MF. Very recently, theory has predicted MFs to
induce spin selective Andreev reflection (SSAR), a novel magnetic property
which can be used to detect the MFs. Here we report the first observation of
the SSAR from MFs inside vortices in Bi2Te3/NbSe2 hetero-structure, in which
topological superconductivity was previously established. By using
spin-polarized scanning tunneling microscopy/spectroscopy (STM/STS), we show
that the zero-bias peak of the tunneling differential conductance at the vortex
center is substantially higher when the tip polarization and the external
magnetic field are parallel than anti-parallel to each other. Such strong spin
dependence of the tunneling is absent away from the vortex center, or in a
conventional superconductor. The observed spin dependent tunneling effect is a
direct evidence for the SSAR from MFs, fully consistent with theoretical
analyses. Our work provides definitive evidences of MFs and will stimulate the
MFs research on their novel physical properties, hence a step towards their
statistics and application in quantum computing.

Summary from 1992 January 1 to 2015 December 31. We find that the $\alpha$ and
$\beta$ class active regions (including all sub-groups e.g. $\beta\gamma$,
$\beta\delta$) make up fractions of approximately 20% and 80% of the sample
respectively. This fraction is relatively constant during high levels of
activity, however, an increase in the $\alpha$ fraction to about 35% and and a
decrease in the $\beta$ fraction to about 65% can be seen near each solar
minimum and is statistically significant at the 2-$\sigma$ level. Over 30% of
all active regions observed during the years of solar maxima were appended with
the classifications $\gamma$ and/or $\delta$, while these classifications
account for only a fraction of a percent during the years near the solar
minima. This variation in the active region types indicates that the formation
of complex active regions may be due to the pileup of frequent emergence of
magnetic flux during solar maximum, rather than the emergence of complex,

overturned in light of quantum correlations. Nevertheless, quantum mechanics
does not permit signalling and hence a notion of cause remains. Understanding
this notion is not only important at a fundamental level, but also for
technological applications such as key distribution and randomness expansion.
It has recently been shown that a useful way to decide which classical causal
structures could give rise to a given set of correlations is to use entropy
vectors. These are vectors whose components are the entropies of all subsets of
the observed variables in the causal structure. The entropy vector method
employs causal relationships among the variables to restrict the set of
possible entropy vectors. Here, we consider whether the same approach can lead
to useful certificates of non-classicality within a given causal structure.
Surprisingly, we find that for a family of causal structures that include the
usual bipartite Bell structure they do not. For all members of this family, no
function of the entropies of the observed variables gives such a certificate,
in spite of the existence of nonclassical correlations. It is therefore
necessary to look beyond entropy vectors to understand cause from a quantum
perspective.

away from the point of interaction and is not immediately thermalised into the

generates instability in homogeneous initial conditions. High levels of
turbulence follow, triggering the Jeans mechanism and leading to the formation
of galaxies and large-scale structure in the order of 10 Myrs. Friedmann
cosmology is perturbed, creating a fractal Voronoi matter distribution and
providing energy for reionisation. In keeping with observations, general
relativity predicts that there is no bound on the size of the structures
produced. The true (overall) rate of expansion is substantially below the
observed (local) value of Hubble's constant, and is consistent with published
estimates from the CMB for void models. The CMB is predicted to show near
flatness over the observed region. It is seen from observation of fluid flows,
from established physics, and from numerical solution of the Navier-Stokes
equations that bisymmetric spiral vortices form where gas flows meet. These
vortices necessarily have flat rotation curves at large radii and create
conditions for spiral galaxy formation. It is shown by N-body simulation that

essential to a wide variety of research fields and technologies such as
hydrogen storage for transportation, precise localization of hydrogen in
electronic devices and the formation of cosmic H2. For coronene cations as
prototypical Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbon (PAH) molecules, the existence of
magic numbers upon hydrogenation was uncovered experimentally. Quantum
chemistry calculations show that hydrogenation follows a site-specific sequence
leading to the appearance of cations having 5, 11, or 17 hydrogen atoms
attached, exactly the magic numbers found in the experiments. For these
closed-shell cations, further hydrogenation requires appreciable structural
changes associated with a high transition barrier. Controlling specific
hydrogenation pathways would provide the possibility to tune the location of
hydrogen attachment and the stability of the system. The sequence to
hydrogenate PAHs, leading to PAHs with magic numbers of H atoms attached,
provides clues to understand that carbon in space is mostly aromatic and
partially aliphatic in PAHs. PAH hydrogenation is fundamental to assess the
contribution of PAHs to the formation of cosmic H2.

the number of local degrees of freedom we present the Hamiltonian formulation

secondary constraints of these theories. Then we obtain the Poisson brackets of
the primary and the secondary constraints. After that we count the number of
local degrees of freedom of spin-3 Chern-Simons-like theories of gravity. We
apply this method on spin-3 Einstein-Cartan gravity and spin-3 topologically

than the critical temperature, $T<T_c$, the critical magnetic field increases
with increasing $b$ and goes to zero as $T\rightarrow T_c$, independent of the

of convoluted search space, the clever use of energy functions, and more
importantly, the use of effective sampling algorithms become crucial to address
this problem. For protein structure modeling, an off-lattice model provides
limited scopes to exercise and evaluate the algorithmic developments due to its
astronomically large set of data-points. In contrast, an on-lattice model
widens the scopes and permits studying the relatively larger proteins because
of its finite set of data-points. In this work, we took the full advantage of
an on-lattice model by using a face-centered-cube lattice that has the highest
packing density with the maximum degree of freedom. We proposed a graded

its doors to the world and whilst many analysts have focused on foreign
investment in popular areas, little has been written about medical device
investment. The purpose of this article is to analyze the status of the Chinese
medical device market from the perspective of the healthcare industry and its
important market drivers; the study reveals that the medical device market has
significant growth potential. This article aims to identify and assess the
profitable sectors of medical device technologies as a guide for international
companies and investors.

"1610.03477","Carlos Barron-Romero Prof.","Carlos Barr\'on-Romero","Complexity and Stop Conditions for NP as General Assignment Problems,
  the Travel Salesman Problem in $\mathbb{R}^2$, Knight Tour Problem and
  Boolean Satisfiability Problem",,,,,"cs.DS","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  This paper presents stop conditions for solving General Assignment Problems
(GAP), in particular for Travel Salesman Problem in an Euclidian 2D space the
well known condition Jordan's simple curve and opposite condition for the
Knight Tour Problem. The Jordan's simple curve condition means that a optimal
trajectory must be simple curve, i.e., without crossing but for Knight Tour
Problem we use the contrary, the feasible trajectory must have crossing in all
cities of the tour. The paper presents the algorithms, examples and some
results come from Concorde's Home page. Several problem are studied to depict
their properties. A classical decision problem SAT is studied in detail.
