powerful tool to achieve round-robin scheduling, which is crucial in
applications as diverse as media access control of communication networks,
realization of analog-to-digital converters, and scheduling of traffic flows in
intersections. Driven by the increased application of pulse-coupled oscillators
in achieving synchronization, desynchronization of pulse-coupled oscillators is
also receiving more attention. In this paper, we propose a phase
desynchronization algorithm by rigorously analyzing the dynamics of
pulse-coupled oscillators and carefully designing the pulse based interaction
function. A systematic proof for convergence to phase desynchronization is also
given. Different from many existing results which can only achieve equal
separation of firing time instants, the proposed approach can achieve equal
separation of phases, which is more difficult to achieve due to phase jumps in
pulse-coupled oscillators. Furthermore, the new strategy can guarantee
achievement of desynchronization even when some nodes have identical initial
phases, a situation which fails most existing desynchronization approaches.
Numerical simulation results are provided to illustrate the effectiveness of
the theoretical results.

well-known challenge in exploratory subgroup analyses is the small sample size
in the considered subgroups, which is usually too low to allow for definite
comparisons. In early phase trials this problem is further exaggerated, because
limited or no clinical prior information on the drug and plausible subgroups is
available. We evaluate novel strategies for treatment effect estimation in
these settings in a simulation study motivated by real clinical trial
situations. We compare several approaches to estimate treatment effects for
selected subgroups, employing model averaging, resampling and Lasso regression
methods. Two subgroup identification approaches are employed, one based on
categorization of covariates and the other based on splines. Our results show
that naive estimation of the treatment effect, which ignores that a selection
has taken place, leads to bias and overoptimistic conclusions. For the
considered simulation scenarios virtually all evaluated novel methods provide
more adequate estimates of the treatment effect for selected subgroups, in
terms of bias, MSE and confidence interval coverage.

renormalizable in 4 dimensions of spacetime). Furthermore, it is, as we
believe, useful for computer calculations. In [4] on which this paper is based
the formulation of [1, 2, 3] gets slightly altered in a fashion specialized in
the case of the Feynman gauge. It is then formulated as a graph polynomial $

galaxies with $M_{*}>10^9{{\rm M}_{\odot}}$) are affected at the level of at
most $1~$km/s, which is negligible for $1\%$-precision cosmology. We caution
that since EAGLE overestimates cluster gas fractions it may also underestimate
the impact of baryons, particularly for the total matter power spectrum.
Nevertheless, our findings suggest that for theoretical modelling of redshift
space distortions and galaxy velocity-based statistics, baryons and their
back-reaction can be safely ignored at the current level of observational
accuracy. However, we confirm that the modelling of the total matter power

$O(1/r)$ error bound if $h$ is the density of a beta distribution. In this

In this study the hemodynamics of stented coronary bifurcations under pulsatile
flow conditions were investigated experimentally. Three implantation methods,
provisional side branch (PSB), culotte (CUL), and crush (CRU), were
investigated using time-resolved particle image velocimetry (PIV) to measure
the velocity fields. Subsequently, hemodynamic parameters including wall shear
stress (WSS), oscillatory shear index (OSI), and relative residence time (RRT)
were calculated and the pressure field through the vessel was non-invasively
quantified. The effects of each stented case were evaluated and compared
against an un-stented case. CRU provided the lowest compliance mismatch, but
demonstrated detrimental stent interactions. PSB, the clinically preferred
method, and CUL maintained many normal flow conditions. However, PSB provided
about a 300% increase in both OSI and RRT. CUL yielded a 10% and 85% increase
in OSI and RRT, respectively. The results of this study support the concept
that different bifurcation stenting techniques result in hemodynamic
environments that deviate from that of un-stented bifurcations, to varying

noise, line-of-sight contamination, field selection, and the incomplete
sampling in interferometric measurements. We solve the integrals that describe
the convolution of a cloud PDF with contaminating sources and study the impact
of missing information on the measured column density PDF. The effect of
observational noise can be easily estimated and corrected for if the root mean
square (rms) of the noise is known. For $\sigma_{noise}$ values below 40% of
the typical cloud column density, $N_{peak}$, this involves almost no
degradation of the accuracy of the PDF parameters. For higher noise levels and
narrow cloud PDFs the width of the PDF becomes increasingly uncertain. A
contamination by turbulent foreground or background clouds can be removed as a
constant shield if the PDF of the contamination peaks at a lower column or is
narrower than that of the observed cloud. Uncertainties in the definition of
the cloud boundaries mainly affect the low-column density part of the PDF and
the mean density. As long as more than 50% of a cloud are covered, the impact
on the PDF parameters is negligible. In contrast, the incomplete sampling of
the uv plane in interferometric observations leads to uncorrectable distortions
of the PDF of the produced maps. An extension of ALMA's capabilities would
allow us to recover the high-column density tail of the PDF but we found no way
to measure the intermediate and low column density part of the underlying cloud

lasted for about 9 months and that the emission of the source remained soft for
the entire period. The source emission is dominated by a thermal component
(kT~1.2 keV), most likely produced by an accretion disk. The XMM-Newton
observation carried out during the outburst revealed the presence of multiple
absorption features in the soft X-ray emission that could be associated to the
presence of an ionized absorber lying above the accretion disk, as observed in

of two consecutive X-ray eclipses in the XMM-Newton data allowed us to estimate

Conversely, when the normal layer is atomically thin, the tunneling of Cooper
pairs induces an excitation gap that can be as large as the bulk gap of the
superconductor. We study how these two seemingly different views of the
proximity effect evolve into one another as the thickness of the normal layer
is changed. We show that a fully quantum-mechanical treatment of the problem
predicts that the induced gap is always finite but falls off with the thickness
of the normal layer, $d$. If $d$ is less than a certain crossover scale, which
is much larger than the Fermi wavelength, the induced gap is comparable to the
bulk gap. As a result, a sizable excitation gap can be induced in normal layers
that are much thicker than the Fermi wavelength.

protein channels known as nuclear pores cross the nuclear envelope and regulate
the passage of other proteins and RNA molecules. Beyond simply gating
diffusion, the system of nuclear pores and associated transport receptors is
able to generate substantial concentration gradients, at the energetic expense
of guanosine triphosphate (GTP) hydrolysis. In contrast to conventional
approaches to demixing such as reverse osmosis or dialysis, the biological
system operates continuously, without application of cyclic changes in pressure
or solvent exchange. Abstracting the biological paradigm, we examine this

  Platek set theory",,,,,"math.LO","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Until the 1970s, proof theoretic investigations were mainly concerned with
theories of inductive definitions, subsystems of analysis and finite type
systems. With the pioneering work of Gerhard Jaeger in the late 1970s and early
1980s, the focus switched to set theories, furnishing ordinal-theoretic proof
theory with a uniform and elegant framework. More recently it was shown that
these tools can even sometimes be adapted to the context of strong axioms such
as the powerset axiom, where one does not attain complete cut elimination but
can nevertheless extract witnessing information and characterize the strength
of the theory in terms of provable heights of the cumulative hierarchy. Here
this technology is applied to intuitionistic Kripke-Platek set theories IKP(P)
and IKP(E), where the operation of powerset and exponentiation, respectively,
is allowed as a primitive in the separation and collection schemata. In
particular, IKP(P) proves the powerset axiom whereas IKP(E) proves the
exponentiation axiom. The latter expresses that given any sets A and B, the
collection of all functions from A to B is a set, too. While IKP(P) can be
dealt with in a similar vein as its classical cousin, the treatment of IKP(E)
posed considerable obstacles. One of them was that in the infinitary system the
levels of terms become a moving target as they cannot be assigned a fixed level
in the formal cumulative hierarchy solely based on their syntactic structure.
As adumbrated in an earlier paper, the results of this paper are an important
tool in showing that several intuitionistic set theories with the collection
axiom possess the existence property, i.e., if they prove an existential
theorem then a witness can be provably described in the theory, one example
being intuitionistic Zermelo-Fraenkel set theory with bounded separation.

Mira's millimetre continuum emission and our data are consistent with a radio
photosphere with a brightness temperature of 2611$\pm$51 K, in agreement with
recent results obtained with the VLA. We do not confirm the existence of a
compact region (<5 mas) of enhanced brightness. We derive the gas density,
kinetic temperature, molecular abundance and outflow/infall velocities in
Mira's extended atmosphere by modelling the SiO and H$_2$O lines. We find that
SiO-bearing gas starts to deplete beyond 4$R_\star$ and at a kinetic
temperature of $\lesssim$600 K. The inner dust shells are probably composed of
grain types other than pure silicates. During this observation, Mira's
atmosphere generally exhibited infall motion, with a shock front of velocity
$\lesssim$12 km/s outside the radio photosphere. The structures predicted by
the hydrodynamical model CODEX can reproduce the observed spectra in
astonishing detail; while some other models fail when confronted with the new

deduced in classical L_{\infty\omega} logic from geometric theories also have
intuitionistic proofs. Barr's theorem is of a topos-theoretic nature and its
proof is non-constructive. In the literature one also finds mysterious comments
about the capacity of this theorem to remove the axiom of choice from
derivations. This article investigates the proof-theoretic side of Barr's
theorem and also aims to shed some light on the axiom of choice part. More
concretely, a constructive proof of the Hauptsatz for L_{\infty\omega} is given

quasi-particles that pair to form either spin-singlet or spin-triplet bound
states. The ""spin"" of a Bloch electron, however, is fixed by the symmetries of
the crystal and the atomic orbitals from which it is derived, and in some cases
can behave as if it were a spin-3/2 particle. The superconducting state of such
a system allows pairing beyond spin-triplet, with higher spin quasi-particles
combining to form quintet or septet pairs. Here, we report evidence of
unconventional superconductivity emerging from a spin-3/2 quasiparticle
electronic structure in the half-Heusler semimetal YPtBi, a low-carrier density
noncentrosymmetric cubic material with a high symmetry that preserves the
$p$-like $j=3/2$ manifold in the Bi-based $\Gamma_8$ band in the presence of
strong spin-orbit coupling. With a striking linear temperature dependence of
the London penetration depth, the existence of line nodes in the
superconducting order parameter $\Delta$ is directly explained by a
mixed-parity Cooper pairing model with high total angular momentum, consistent
with a high-spin fermionic superfluid state. We propose a $\mathbf{k\cdot p}$
model of the $j=3/2$ fermions to explain how a dominant $J$=3 septet pairing
state is the simplest solution that naturally produces nodes in the mixed
even-odd parity gap. Together with the underlying topologically non-trivial
band structure, the unconventional pairing in this system represents a truly
novel form of superfluidity that has strong potential for leading the
development of a new generation of topological superconductors.

dependence of low frequency quasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs) in the X-ray
flux of GRS 1915+105. The QPO frequency in this source has previously been
observed to depend on photon energy, with the frequency increasing with energy
for observations with a high ($\gtrsim 2$ Hz) QPO frequency, and decreasing
with energy for observations with a low ($\lesssim 2$ Hz) QPO frequency. As
this observed energy dependence is currently unexplained, we investigate if it
is intrinsic to the QPO mechanism by tracking phase lags on (sub)second
timescales. We find that the phase lag between two broad energy bands
systematically increases for $5$ - $10$ QPO cycles, after which the QPO becomes
decoherent, the phase lag resets and the pattern repeats. This shows that the
band with the higher QPO frequency is running away from the other band on short
timescales, providing strong evidence that the energy dependence of the QPO
frequency is intrinsic. We also find that the faster the QPO decoheres, the
faster the phase lag increases, suggesting that the intrinsic frequency
difference contributes to the decoherence of the QPO. We interpret our results
within a simple geometric QPO model, where different radii in the inner
accretion flow experience Lense-Thirring precession at different frequencies,
causing the decoherence of the oscillation. By varying the spectral shape of
the inner accretion flow as a function of radius, we are able to qualitatively
explain the energy-dependent behaviour of both QPO frequency and phase lag.

ground state (GS) fermion parity in one-dimensional topological superconducting
lattice systems. Using a Majorana transfer matrix method, we find that Majorana
wavefunction properties are encoded in the associated Lyapunov exponent, which
in turn is the sum of two independent components: a `superconducting component'
which characterizes the gap induced decay, and the `normal component', which
determines the oscillations and response to chemical potential configurations.
The topological phase transition separating phases with and without Majorana
end modes is seen to be a cancellation of these two components. We show that
Majorana wavefunction oscillations are completely determined by an underlying
non-superconducting tight-binding model and are solely responsible for GS
fermion parity switches in finite-sized systems. These observations enable us
to analytically chart out wavefunction oscillations, the resultant GS parity
configuration as a function of parameter space in uniform wires, and special
parity switch points where degenerate zero energy Majorana modes are restored
in spite of finite size effects. For disordered wires, we find that band
oscillations are completely washed out leading to a second localization length
for the Majorana mode and the remnant oscillations are randomized as per
Anderson localization physics in normal systems. Our transfer matrix method
further allows us to i) reproduce known results on the scaling of mid-gap
Majorana states and demonstrate the origin of its log-normal distribution, ii)
identify contrasting behavior of disorder-dependent GS parity switches for the
cases of even versus odd number of lattice sites, and iii) chart out the GS
parity configuration and associated parity switch points as a function of
disorder strength.

  II. Application to periodic lattices of finite length",,,,,"physics.class-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The paper deals with the generic problem of two waveguides coupled by
perforations, which can be perforated tube mufflers without or with partitions,
possibly with absorbing materials. Other examples are ducts with branched
resonators of honeycomb cavities , which can be coupled or not, and splitter
silencers. Assuming low frequencies, only one mode is considered in each guide.
The propagation in the two waveguides can be very different, thanks e.g. to the
presence of constrictions. The model is a discrete, periodic one, based upon
4th-order impedance matrices and their diagonalization. All the calculation is
analytical, thanks to the partition of the matrices in 2nd-order matrices, and
allows the treatment of a very wide types of problems. Several aspects are
investigated: the local or non-local character of the reaction of one guide to
the other; the definition of a coupling coefficient; the effect of finite size
when a lattice with n cells in inserted into an infinite guide; the
relationship between the Insertion Loss and the dispersion. The assumptions are
as follows: linear acoustics, no mean flow, rigid wall. However the effect of
the series impedance of the perforations, which is generally ignored, is taken
into account, and is dis- cussed. When there are no losses, it is shown that,
for symmetry reasons, the cutoff frequencies depend on either the series
impedance or the shunt admittance , and are the eigenfrequencies of the cells
of the lattice, with zero-pressure or zero-velocity at the ends of the cells.

assumption of orthodox quantum mechanics necessitates only the following
requirement: an agent's free-choice performance in the selection of measurement
settings must not represent an exception to the rule of irreducible quantum
indeterminism in the physical universe (i.e, ""universal indeterminism""). Any
additional metaphysical speculation, such as to whether quantum indeterminism,
i.e., intrinsic randomness, implicates the reality of experimenter ""freedom"",
""free will"", or ""free choice"", is redundant in relation to the predictive
success of orthodox quantum mechanics. Accordingly, super-indeterminism views
as redundant also, from a technical standpoint, whether an affirmative or a
negative answer is claimed in reference to universal indeterminism as a
necessary precondition for experimenter freedom. Super-indeterminism accounts,
for example, for the circular reasoning which is implicit in the free will
theorem by Conway and Kochen. The concept of super-indeterminism is of great
assistance in clarifying the often misunderstood meaning of the concept of
""free variables"" as used by John Bell. The present work argues that Bell sought
an operational, effective free will theorem, one based upon the notion of
""determinism without predetermination"", i.e., one wherein ""free variables""
represent universally uncomputable variables. In conclusion, the standard
interpretation of quantum theory does not answer, and does not need to answer
in order to ensure the predictive success of orthodox theory, the question of
whether either incompatibilism or compatibilism is valid in relation to
free-will metaphysics and to the free-will phenomenology of experimenter agents
in quantum mechanics.

attacks are Denial of Service (or Degradation of Service) attacks caused by
contention for hardware memory resources on a cloud server. Despite the strong
memory isolation techniques for virtual machines (VMs) enforced by the software
virtualization layer in cloud servers, the underlying hardware memory layers
are still shared by the VMs and can be exploited by a clever attacker in a
hostile VM co-located on the same server as the victim VM, denying the victim
the working memory he needs. We first show quantitatively the severity of
contention on different memory resources. We then show that a malicious cloud
customer can mount low-cost attacks to cause severe performance degradation for
a Hadoop distributed application, and 38X delay in response time for an
E-commerce website in the Amazon EC2 cloud.
  Then, we design an effective, new defense against these memory DoS attacks,
using a statistical metric to detect their existence and execution throttling
to mitigate the attack damage. We achieve this by a novel re-purposing of
existing hardware performance counters and duty cycle modulation for security,
rather than for improving performance or power consumption. We implement a full
prototype on the OpenStack cloud system. Our evaluations show that this defense
system can effectively defeat memory DoS attacks with negligible performance
overhead.

This suggests that the pairing symmetry corresponds to a two-dimensional

is a nematic superconductor. In this work, we present a comprehensive study of
the upper critical field $H_{c2}$ of nematic superconductors within
Ginzburg-Landau (GL) theory. Contrary to typical GL theories which have an
emergent U(1) rotational symmetry obscuring the discrete symmetry of the
crystal, the theory of two-component superconductors in trigonal crystals
reflects the true $D_{3d}$ crystal symmetry. This has direct implications for
the upper critical field. First, $H_{c2}$ of trigonal superconductors exhibits
a sixfold anisotropy in the basal plane. Second, when the degeneracy of the two
components is lifted by, e.g., uniaxial strain, $H_{c2}$ exhibits a twofold
anisotropy with characteristic angle and temperature dependence. Our thorough
study shows that measurement of the upper critical field is a direct method of
detecting nematic superconductivity, which is directly applicable to

theoretical uncertainties within the present covariant models for the
prediction of physical observables relevant for octupole deformed nuclei. In
addition, a detailed comparison with the predictions of non-relativistic models

make up most of the mass within the disk regions of high-redshift star-forming
disk galaxies, with typical disks at z > 2 being strongly baryon-dominated
within $R_e$. Substantial object-to-object variations in both stellar and
baryonic mass fractions are observed among the galaxies in our sample, larger
than what can be accounted for by the formal uncertainties in their respective

measures of surface density. High $\Sigma_{star}$ galaxies feature stellar mass
fractions closer to unity, and systems with high inferred gas or baryonic
surface densities leave less room for additional mass components other than

nonsymmorphic heavy fermion insulators Ce$_3$Bi$_4$Pt$_3$ and CeNiSn reveals
the presence of low temperature conductivity plateau, making them candidate
members of the new class of material. We illustrate our ideas with a specific
model for CeNiSn, showing how glide symmetries generate surface states with a
novel Mobius braiding that can be detected by ARPES or non-local conductivity
measurements. One of the interesting effects of strong correlation, is the
development of partially localization or ""Kondo breakdown"" on the surfaces,
which transforms Mobius surface states into quasi-one dimensional conductors,
with the potential for novel electronic phase transitions.

$M_{\rm BH}$ and $L/L_{\rm edd}$ and covers the most prominent UV-optical

paper focuses on single-epoch, ""virial"" $M_{\rm BH}$ determinations from broad
emission lines and examines the implications of different continuum modeling
approaches in line width measurements. We find that using a ""local"" power-law
continuum instead of a physically-motivated thin disk continuum leads to only
slight underestimation of the FWHM of the lines and the associated $M_{\rm
BH}\left({\rm FWHM}\right)$. However, the line dispersion $\sigma_{\rm line}$
and associated $M_{\rm BH}\left(\sigma_{\rm line}\right)$ are strongly affected
by the continuum placement and provides less reliable mass estimates than
FWHM-based methods. Our analysis shows that H$\alpha$, H$\beta$ and MgII can be
safely used for virial $M_{\rm BH}$ estimation. The CIV line, on the other
hand, is not reliable in the majority of the cases, this may indicate that the
gas emitting this line is not virialized. While H$\alpha$ and H$\beta$ show
very similar line widths, the mean ${\rm FWHM\left(MgII\right)}$ is about 30%
narrower than ${\rm FWHM\left(H\beta\right)}$. We confirm several recent
suggestions to improve the accuracy in CIV-based mass estimates, relying on
other UV emission lines. Such improvements do not reduce the scatter between
CIV-based and Balmer-line-based mass estimates.

kinematically classify our galaxies in `disk' and `merger'. We simulate our
systems at z=3 to evaluate how a loss of angular resolution affects our
results. From the kinemetry-based analysis we are able classify our local

For both hadrons and jets, we calculate the correlation of the peak of the
spectrum with the top quark mass, considering the ""energy-peak"" as an
observable to determine the top quark mass. Such a method is motivated by our
previous work where we argued that this approach can have reduced sensitivity
to the details of the production mechanism of the top quark, whether it is
higher-order QCD effects or new physics contributions. As part of the NLO
improvement over the original proposal, we assess the residual sensitivity of
the extracted top quark mass to perturbative effects both in top quark
production and decay. For a 1% jet energy scale uncertainty (and assuming
negligible statistical error), the top quark mass can then be extracted using
the energy-peak of b-jets with an error +- (1.2 (exp) + 0.6(th)) GeV. We note
that recently the CMS collaboration reported a top quark mass measurement based
on the original proposal (with b-jets) so that our result contributes to a
precise evaluation of the associated theory uncertainty. In view of the
dominant jet energy scale uncertainty in the measurement using b-jets, we also
investigate the extraction of the top quark mass from the energy-peak of the
corresponding B-hadrons which, in principle, can be measured without this
uncertainty. The calculation of the B-hadron energy spectrum is carried out
using fragmentation functions at NLO. The dependence on the fragmentation scale
turns out to be the largest theoretical uncertainty in this extraction of top
quark mass. Future improvement of the treatment of bottom quark hadronization
can reduce this uncertainty, rendering methods based on the B-hadron
energy-peak competitive for the top quark mass measurement.

important to be considered as a first-order approximation of the behavior of a
fluid particle suspended in air, because of the significant acoustic impedance
mismatch at the particle's boundary. Based on the partial-wave series expansion
method in cylindrical coordinates, non-dimensional acoustic radiation force and
torque functions are derived and defined in terms of the scattering
coefficients of the elliptic cylinder. A coupled system of linear equations is
obtained after applying the Neumann boundary condition for an immovable surface
in a non-viscous fluid, and solved numerically by matrix inversion after
performing a single numerical integration procedure. Computational results for
the non-dimensional force components and torque, showing the transition from
the progressive to the (equi-amplitude) standing wave behavior, are performed
with particular emphasis on the aspect ratio a/b, where a and b are the
semi-axes of the ellipse, the dimensionless size parameter, as well as the
angle of incidence ranging from end-on to broadside incidence. The results show
that the elliptical geometry has a direct influence on the radiation force and
torque, so that the standard theory for circular cylinders (at normal
incidence) leads to significant miscalculations when the cylinder cross-section
becomes non-circular. Moreover, the elliptical cylinder experiences, in
addition to the acoustic radiation force, a radiation torque that vanishes for
the circular cylinder case. The application of the formalism presented here may
be extended to other 2D surfaces of arbitrary shape.

(2) stiffening of the quark matter EoS at high densities due to multiquark

an early onset and large density jump. The third feature results from a Maxwell
construction for the possible transition from the nuclear to a quark matter

that yields solutions of the Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff (TOV) equations for
sequences of hadronic and hybrid stars in the mass-radius diagram which cover
the full range of patterns according to the Alford-Han-Prakash classification

disconnected with the hadronic one. The latter case often includes a tiny
connected branch. The disconnected hybrid star branch, also called ""third

gravitational mass but different radii. We perform a Bayesian analysis and

nanoparticle flow velocity using confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM). The
two primary issues that complicate nanoparticle scanning laser image
correlation (SLIC) based velocimetry are (1) the use of diffusion dominated
nanoparticles as flow tracers, which introduce a random decorrelating error
into the velocity estimate, and (2) the effects of the scanning laser image
acquisition, which introduces a bias error. To date, no study has quantified
these errors or demonstrated a means to deal with them in SLIC velocimetry. In
this work, we build upon the robust phase correlation (RPC) and existing
methods of SLIC to quantify and mitigate these errors. First, we implement an
ensemble RPC instead of using an ensemble standard cross correlation, and
develop an SLIC optimal filter that maximizes the correlation strength in order
to reliably and accurately detect the correlation peak representing the most
probable average displacement of the nanoparticles. Secondly, we developed an
analytical model of the SLIC measurement bias error due to image scanning of
diffusion dominated tracer particles. We show that the bias error depends only
on the ratio of the mean velocity of the tracer particles to that of the laser
scanner and we use this model to correct the induced errors. We validated our
technique using synthetic images and experimentally obtained SLIC images of
nanoparticle flow through a micro-channel. Our technique reduced the error by
up to a factor of ten compared to other SLIC algorithms for the images tested
in this study. Moreover, our optimized RPC filter is reducing the number of
image pairs required for the convergence of the ensemble correlation by two
orders of magnitude compared to the standard cross correlation.

of the Cho-Duan-Ge gauge independent Abelian decomposition. The decomposition
splits the gauge field into a restricted Abelian part and a coloured part in a
way that preserves gauge covariance. The restricted part of the gauge field can
be divided into a Maxwell term and a topological term. Previously, we showed
that by a particular choice of this decomposition we could fully describe the
confining potential using only the restricted gauge field. We proposed that
various topological objects (a form of magnetic monopole) could arise in the
restricted field which would drive confinement. Our mechanism does not
explicitly refer to a dual Meissner effect, nor does it use centre vortices. We
did not need to gauge fix or introduce any new dynamical fields.
  We show that if we do gauge fix as well as performing the Abelian
decomposition then it is possible to ensure that the topological part of the
restricted field fully accounts for the confining potential. Our relationship
is exact: there is no approximation or model involved. This isolates the
objects responsible for confinement from non-confining contributions to the
gauge field, allowing a direct search for our proposed topological objects.
Using numerical studies in SU(2), we confirm that our proposed monopoles are
present in the field, and the winding number associated with these monopoles is
a key factor driving quark confinement.
  In SU(2), our monopoles are described by two parameters. We show that it is
possible to re-parametrise the Yang Mills action and the functional integration
measure in terms of these variables (plus the necessary additional parameters).
We can thus treat the monopoles as dynamical variables in the functional
integral. This might be the first step in a future analytical computation to
complement our numerical results.

singular nature of low-energy flexural phonon emission. Our model can be viewed
as a two-channel generalization of the independent boson model with asymmetric
atom-phonon coupling. This allows us to take advantage of the exact
non-perturbative solution of the independent boson model in the stronger
channel while treating the weaker one perturbatively. In the low-energy limit,
the exact solution can be viewed as a resummation (exponentiation) of the most
divergent diagrams in the perturbative expansion. As a result of this
procedure, we obtain the atom's Green function which we use to calculate the
atom damping rate, a quantity equal to the quantum sticking rate. A
characteristic feature of our results is that the Green's function retains a
weak, infrared cutoff dependence that reflects the reduced dimensionality of
the problem. As a consequence, we predict a measurable dependence of the
sticking rate on graphene sample size. We provide detailed predictions for the
sticking rate of atomic hydrogen as a function of temperature and sample size.
The resummation yields an enhanced sticking rate relative to the conventional
Fermi golden rule result (equivalent to the one-loop atom self-energy), as
higher-order processes increase damping at finite temperature.

This prediction exploits the fact that while RGB to YUV color conversion has

there is still some correlation locally at the block level. Previous proposals
compute a linear model of the spatial relationship between the luma plane (Y)
and the two chroma planes (U and V). In codecs that use lapped transforms this
is not possible since transform support extends across the block boundaries and
thus neighboring blocks are unavailable during intra-prediction. We design a
frequency domain intra predictor for chroma that exploits the same local
correlation with lower complexity than the spatial predictor and which works
with lapped transforms. We then describe a low-complexity algorithm that
directly uses luma coefficients as a chroma predictor based on gain-shape
quantization and band partitioning. An experiment is performed that compares
these two techniques inside the experimental Daala video codec and shows the
lower complexity algorithm to be a better chroma predictor.

differently depending on the relative orientations of the symmetry axis of the
spin center and the radius vector connecting the pair. Exchange interactions
between transition-metal dopants behave similarly to those of NV$^-$ centers.
The Mn\---Mn exchange interaction decays with a much longer length scale than
the Cr\---Cr and Ni\---Ni exchange interactions, exceeding dipolar interactions
for Mn\---Mn separations less than 5~nm. Calculations of these highly
anisotropic and spin-center-dependent interactions provide the potential for
design of the spin-spin interactions for novel nanomagnetic structures.

Developing and maintaining high-performance applications and libraries for
heterogeneous architectures while preserving its semantics and with a
reasonable efficiency is a time-consuming task which is often only possible for
experts. It often requires manually adapting sequential, platform-agnostic code
to different infrastructures, and keeping the changes in all of these
infrastructures in sync. These program modification tasks are costly and
error-prone. Tools to assist in and, if possible, automate such transformations
are of course of great interest. However, such tools may need significant
reasoning and knowledge processing capabilities, including, for example, being
able to process machine-understandable descriptions of the semantics of a piece
of code is expected to do; to perform program transformations inside a context
in which they are applicable; to use strategies to identify the sequence of
transformations leading to the best resulting code; and others.

the Dirichlet distribution. An exact polynomial-time algorithm is known for

$z$$>$3.5, from detections of undepleted elements in high-resolution data for a
sub-DLA at $z$=5.0. We obtain fairly robust abundances of C, O, Si, and Fe,
using lines outside the Lyman-alpha forest. This absorber is metal-poor, with
O/H]=-2.00$\pm$0.12, which is $\gtrsim$4$\sigma$ below the level expected from
extrapolation of the trend for $z$$<$3.5 sub-DLAs. The C/O ratio is

expected if high-redshift supernovae form more silicate-rich dust. C/O and Si/O
vary substantially between different velocity components, indicating spatial

exhibit an extended main-sequence turn off (eMSTO) whose origin is under
debate. The main scenarios suggest that the eMSTO could be either due to
multiple generations of stars with different ages or to coeval stellar
populations with different rotation rates.
  In this paper we use Hubble-Space-Telescope images to investigate the ~80-Myr
old cluster NGC1755 in the LMC. We find that the MS is split with the blue and
the red MS hosting about the 25% and the 75% of the total number of MS stars,
respectively. Moreover, the MSTO of NGC1755 is broadened in close analogy with
what is observed in the ~300-Myr-old NGC1856 and in most intermediate-age
Magellanic-Cloud clusters. We demonstrate that both the split MS and the eMSTO
are not due to photometric errors, field-stars contamination, differential
reddening, or non-interacting binaries. These findings make NGC1755 the
youngest cluster with an eMSTO.
  We compare the observed CMD with isochrones and conclude that observations
are not consistent with stellar populations with difference in age, helium, or
metallicity only. On the contrary, the split MS is well reproduced by two
stellar populations with different rotation, although the fit between the
observed eMSTO and models with different rotation is not fully satisfactory. We
speculate whether all stars in NGC1755 were born rapidly rotating, and a
fraction has slowed down on a rapid timescale, or the dichotomy in rotation
rate was present already at star formation. We discuss the implication of these
findings on the interpretation of eMSTO in young and intermediate-age clusters.

random fields which exhibit, what we call, local invariant nonstationarity. We
argue that the local invariant property has a special interaction with a new
generalized quadratic estimate---also derived here---which extends an estimate
originally developed for gravitational lensing of the Cosmic Microwave
Background in Cosmology \cite{hu2001mapping, hu2002mass}. The nature of this
interaction not only encourages low estimation bias but also enables accurate
(and fast) quantification of Frequentist mean square error quantification of
the estimated nonstationarity. These quadratic estimates are interesting, in
their own right, as they detect and estimate nonstationarity by probing
correlation among Fourier frequencies, the absence of which is the
characterizing feature of weak stationarity (by Bochner's Theorem). Moreover,
this generalized quadratic estimate can be computed with a Fourier
characterization that runs in $\mathcal O(n\log n)$ time when observing the
field on a uniform grid of size $n$ in $\Bbb R^d $. Finally, the work presented
here partially addresses two other problems associated with the statistical
theory of nonstationarity: 1) estimating the phase of a spatially varying
modulated stationary random field and 2) identifying a larger class of
nonstationary random fields which admit an extension of the quadratic estimator
of gravitational lensing that extends the same attractive statistical
properties.

(b/a>0.7) and edge-on (b/a<=0.4) subsamples solely to dust attenuation, and
obtain the average attenuation in the rest-frame UV and optical as functions of
stellar mass and redshift out to z=2.5. Our results show that the attenuation
curve becomes remarkably flatter at increasing redshift for both massive and
low-mass disk SFGs, and remains likely unchanged with galaxy stellar mass at a
fixed epoch within uncertainties. Compared with the Calzetti law, our dust
attenuation curves appear to be slightly steeper at 0.5<z<1.4 and remarkably
flatter at 1.4<z<2.5. Our findings are consistent with a picture in which the
evolution of dust grain size distribution is mainly responsible for the
evolution of the dust attenuation curve in SFGs; dust shattering becomes a
dominant process at z<~1.4, resulting in an enrichment of small dust grains and
consequently a steeper attenuation curve. We stress that extinction correction
for high-z galaxies should be done using mass- and redshift-dependent
attenuation curves.

introduce a degeneracy in the interpretation of self-lensing light curves. The
degeneracy is intrinsic to self-lensing binaries for which both magnification
by lensing and de-magnification by occultation occur simultaneously and is
caused by the difficulty in separating the contribution of the lensing-induced
magnification from the observed light curve. We demonstrate the severity of the
degeneracy by presenting example self-lensing light curves suffering from the

driven by mobile users, with users more interested in data rather than its

architecture. Research in information-centric networks (ICNs) have resulted in
novel architectures, e.g., CCN/NDN, DONA, and PSIRP/PURSUIT; all agree on named
data based addressing and pervasive caching as integral design components. With
network-wide content caching, enforcement of content access control policies
become non-trivial. Each caching node in the network needs to enforce access
control policies with the help of the content provider. This becomes
inefficient and prone to unbounded latencies especially during provider
outages.
  In this paper, we propose an efficient access control framework for ICN,
which allows legitimate users to access and use the cached content directly,
and does not require verification/authentication by an online provider
authentication server or the content serving router. This framework would help
reduce the impact of system down-time from server outages and reduce delivery
latency by leveraging caching while guaranteeing access only to legitimate
users. Experimental/simulation results demonstrate the suitability of this
scheme for all users, but particularly for mobile users, especially in terms of
the security and latency overheads.

iPRC fails. We derive a formula for the infinitesimal phase response curves
(iPRCs) of limit cycles occurring in piecewise smooth (Filipov) dynamical
systems of arbitrary dimension, subject to a transverse flow condition.
Discontinuous jumps in the iPRC can occur at the boundaries separating
subdomains, and are captured by a linear matching condition. The matching
matrix, $M$, can be derived from the saltation matrix arising in the associated
variational problem. For the special case of linear dynamics away from
switching boundaries, we obtain an explicit expression for the iPRC. We present
examples from cell biology (Glass networks) and neuroscience (central pattern
generator models). We apply the iPRCs obtained to study synchronization and
phase-locking in piecewise smooth limit cycle systems in which synchronization
arises solely due to the crossing of switching manifolds.

to fit empirical data. Our aim is two-fold. First, to achieve computational
savings for large-scale Hamiltonian systems with external forces. Second, to
simultaneously preserve the symplectic structure and the forced structure of
the original system. We first reformulate d'Alembert's principle in the

approaches to reconstruct low-dimensional systems, based on the variational
principle and on the structure-preserving projection, respectively. These two
approaches are proven to yield the same reduced system. Moreover, by
incorporating the vector field into the data ensemble, we provided several
algorithms for energy preservation. In a special case when the external force
is described by the Rayleigh dissipative function, the proposed method
automatically preserves the dissipativity, boundedness, and stability of the

applications, queries can be constructed de novo to elicit information (e.g.,
automated science) or to evade detection with minimal cost (e.g., adversarial

aggregates the results and outputs a linear classifier, and 4) provides a
theoretical guarantee for all possible schemes of aggregation. The proposed
method is proved resilient to noise. We show that the DC framework avoids the
curse of dimensionality: its computational complexity scales linearly with the
dimension. Moreover, we show that the query complexity of DC is near optimal
(within a constant factor of the optimum algorithm). To further support our
theoretical analysis, we compare the performance of DC with the existing work.
We observe that DC consistently outperforms the prior arts in terms of query
complexity while often running orders of magnitude faster.

prove that when $A$ is a low-rank and incoherent matrix, the $\ell_{\infty}$
norm perturbation bound of singular vectors (or eigenvectors in the symmetric
case) is smaller by a factor of $\sqrt{d_1}$ or $\sqrt{d_2}$ for left and right

distinct types of modules in a single directed network, whereas most previous
studies focused on an independent criterion for modules. To address this issue,
we propose a generic notion of the so-called truss structures in directed
networks. Our definition of truss is able to extract two distinct types of
trusses, named the cycle truss and the flow truss, from a unified framework. By
applying the method for finding trusses to empirical networks obtained from a
wide range of research fields, we find that most real networks contain both
cycle and flow trusses. In addition, the abundance of (and the overlap between)
the two types of trusses may be useful to characterize module structures in a
wide variety of empirical networks. Our findings shed light on the importance
of simultaneously considering different types of modules in directed networks.

this ratio, we adopt two strong lensing models: one is the singular isothermal

Via the Markov Chain Mote Carlo method, the posterior distribution of the
cosmological model parameters space is obtained. The results show that the
cosmological model parameters are not sensitive to the parameterized forms of
the power-law index $\gamma$. Furthermore, the PLP model gives a relative
tighter constraint to the cosmological parameters than that of the SIS model.

compatible with that obtained by {\it Planck}2015: $\Omega_{m}=0.313\pm0.013$.

find that the mass required for the cluster pairs to be bound is smaller than
the total gravitational mass. Thus both cluster pairs appear to be ongoing
major mergers. Incorporating SDSS and NVSS/FIRST data, we further examine the
large-scale structure environment and radio emission of the clusters to probe
their origins, which also leads to the discovery of two additional
X-ray-emitting clusters ($z \simeq 0.097$ and $z \simeq 0.147$) in the field of

absorb thermal neutrons and produce capture gamma-rays to indicate the
detection of neutrons, and uses plastic scintillator to moderate neutrons and

traditional 3He counter-based fast neutron detectors, which hinders enhancement

existing stateless model checkers do not support LTL formulae. In some
settings, it is more advantageous to make use of stateless model checking

the recent LTL semantics on finite paths into an actor-based system. We take a

mechanisms : a) Cosmological infall of the intergalactic gas onto the galaxy,
and b) the existence of a hot circumgalactic medium (CGM). Considering only
radial motion, the infall reduces the speed of outflowing gas and even halts
the outflow, depending on the mass and redshift of the galaxy. For star forming
galaxies there exists an upper mass limit beyond which outflows are suppressed
by the gravitational field of the galaxy. We find that infall can reduce this
upper mass limit approximately by a factor of two (independent of the
redshift). Massive galaxies ($\gtrsim 10^{12} M_{\odot}$) host large reservoir
of hot, diffuse CGM around the central part of the galaxy. The CGM acts as a
barrier between the infalling and outflowing gas and provides an additional
source of outflow suppression. We find that at low redshifts ($z\lesssim3.5$),
the CGM is more effective than the infall in suppressing the outflows.
Together, these two processes give a mass range in which galaxies are unable to
have effective outflows. We also discuss the impact of outflow suppression on
the enrichment history of the galaxy and its environment.

laser-driven ion acceleration, with with near complete transfer of the laser
energy to the ions in the relativistic regime. However, there is a fundamental
limit on the maximum attainable ion energy, which is determined by the group
velocity of the laser. The tightly focused laser pulses have group velocities
smaller than the vacuum light speed, and, since they offer the high intensity
needed for the RPA regime, it is plausible that group velocity effects would
manifest themselves in the experiments involving tightly focused pulses and
thin foils. However, in this case, finite spot size effects are important, and
another limiting factor, the transverse expansion of the target, may dominate
over the group velocity effect. As the laser pulse diffracts after passing the
focus, the target expands accordingly due to the transverse intensity profile
of the laser. Due to this expansion, the areal density of the target decreases,
making it transparent for radiation and effectively terminating the
acceleration. The off-normal incidence of the laser on the target, due either
to the experimental setup, or to the deformation of the target, will also lead
to establishing a limit on maximum ion energy.

fluorescent lines, which are most prominent for type II AGN. A clumpy torus
allows photons reflected from the back-side of the torus to leak through the
front free-of-obscuration regions. Therefore, the observed X-ray fluorescent
lines are sensitive to the clumpiness of the torus. We analyse a sample of type
II AGN observed with Chandra HETGS, and measure the fluxes for the Si Ka and Fe
Ka lines. The measured Fe Ka/Si Ka ratios, spanning a range between $5-60$, are
far smaller than the ratios predicted from simulations of smooth tori,
indicating that the tori of the studied sources have clumpy distributions
rather than smooth ones. Compared with simulation results of clumpy tori with a
half-opening angle of 60$^{\circ}$, the Circinus galaxy has a Fe Ka/Si Ka ratio
of $\sim60$, which is close to the simulation results for $N=5$, where $N$ is
the average number of clumps along the line of sight. The Fe Ka/Si Ka ratios of
the other sources are all below the simulation results for $N=2$. Overall, it
shows that the non-Fe fluorescent lines in the soft X-ray band are a
potentially powerful probe of the clumpiness of the torus around AGN.

ro-vibrational emission from six Herbig Ae/Be candidate stars were taken with
CRIRES (CRyogenic high-resolution InfraRed Echelle Spectrograph) at the VLT
(Very Large Telescope). From these spectra, we produce individual and co-added

comparison, we also investigate the FWHM variations with J of modelled CO
ro-vibrational lines from two typical disc geometries produced with the

dust and gas inner disc geometries (inferred by SED and CO ro-vibrational

Conclusions. The FWHM versus J is a potential new gas diagnostic for the inner
disc with e.g. a constant FWHM versus J indicating the presence of a large gas

torus when irradiated by the central AGN. Their intrinsic line width can be
used to probe the line-emitting region. Previous studies have focused on the Fe
Ka line at 6.4 keV, which is the most prominent fluorescent line. These
studies, however, are limited by the spectral resolution of currently available
instruments, the best of which is $\sim1860$ km s$^{-1}$ afforded by the
Chandra High-Energy Grating (HEG). The HEG spectral resolution is improved by a
factor of 4 at 1.74 keV, where the Si Ka line is located. We measured the FWHM
of the Si Ka line for Circinus, Mrk 3, and NGC 1068, which are $570\pm240$,
$730\pm320$, and $320\pm280$ km s$^{-1}$, respectively. They are $3-5$ times
smaller than those measured with the Fe Ka line previously. It shows that the
intrinsic widths of the Fe Ka line are most likely to be over-estimated. The
measured widths of the Si Ka line put the line-emitting region outside the dust
sublimation radius in these galaxies. It indicates that for Compton-thick AGN,
the X-ray fluorescence material are likely to be the same as the dusty torus
emitting in the infrared.

neutron-capture energy selection efficiency, resulted in a reduction of the
systematic uncertainty by 26%. The deficit in the detected number of

the number of modes probed in CMB power spectra. Rather than making forecasts
for specific experimental setups, here we take a more pedagogical approach and
ask how much information we can extract from the CMB if we are only limited by
sample variance. We show that, compared with temperature measurements, the
addition of E-mode polarization doubles the number of modes available out to a
fixed maximum multipole, provided that all of the TT, TE, and EE power spectra
are measured. However, the situation in terms of constraints on particular
parameters is more complicated, as we explain and illustrate graphically. We
also discuss the enhancements in information that can come from adding B-mode
polarization and gravitational lensing. We show how well one could ever
determine the basic cosmological parameters from CMB data compared with what
has been achieved with Planck, which has already probed a substantial fraction
of the TT information. Lastly, we look at constraints on neutrino mass as a
specific example of how lensing information improves future prospects beyond
the current 6-parameter model.

collective usage of these three primary resources can support the sustainable
growth of mobile systems. By defining the 3C resources in their canonical
forms, we reveal the important fact that ""caching"" affects the mobile system
performance by introducing non-causality into the system, whereas ""computing""
achieves capacity gains by performing logical operations across mobile system
entities. Many existing capacity-enhancing techniques such as coded multicast,
collaborative transmissions, and proactive content pushing can be cast into the
native 3C framework for analytical tractability. We further illustrate the

  on complex systems","12 pages, 1 Fig, 30 References",,,,"nlin.AO physics.soc-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Claude Shannons information theory (1949) has had a revolutionary impact on
communication science. A crucial property of his framework is that it decouples
the meaning of a message from the mechanistic details from the actual
communication process itself, which opened the way to solve long-standing
communication problems. Here we argue that a similar impact could be expected
by applying information theory in the context of complexity science to answer
long-standing, cross-domain questions about the nature of complex systems. This
happens by decoupling the domain-specific model details (e.g., neuronal
networks, ecosystems, flocks of birds) from the cross-domain phenomena that
characterize complex systems (e.g., criticality, robustness, tipping points).
This goes beyond using information theory as a non-linear correlation measure,
namely it allows describing a complex system entirely in terms of the storage,
transfer, and modification of informational bits. After all, a phenomenon that
does not depend on model details should best be studied in a framework that
strips away all such details. We highlight the first successes of
information-theoretic descriptions in the recent complexity literature, and
emphasize that this type of research is still in its infancy. Finally we sketch
how such an information-theoretic description may even lead to a new type of
universality among complex systems, with a potentially tremendous impact. The
goal of this perspective article is to motivate a paradigm shift in the young
field of complexity science using a lesson learnt in communication science.

and compressible simulations without or with expansion. It is equivalent to the
1983-2005 closure equation but with critical balance of nonlinear turnover and
linear Alfv\'en times, while the dynamo source term remains unchanged. The
discrepancy with previous incompressible simulations is elucidated. The model
predicts a linear relation between the spectral slopes of total and residual
energies $m_R = -1/2 + 3/2 m_T$. Examining the solar wind data as in
\cite{2013ApJ...770..125C}, our relation is found to be valid whatever the
cross-helicity, even better so at high cross-helicity, with the total energy
slope varying from $1.7$ to $1.55$.

these dissipations should be flux functions, and should exhibit a helical
symmetry as well. Therefore more correct simulations should incorporate
self-consistent dissipation profiles. As a first step in this direction, the
case of uniform dissipation profiles was considered by using the 3D nonlinear
visco-resistive MHD code SpeCyl. It is found that a flattening of the
resistivity profile results in the reduction of the dynamo action, which brings
to marginally-reversed or even non-reversed equilibrium solutions. The physical
origin of this result is discussed in relation to the electrostatic drift
explanation of the RFP dynamo. This sets constraints on the functional choice

dimension $d\geq 2$ and called random tensor models. More specifically, we
insist on generalizing the two-dimensional notion of $p$-angulations to higher
dimensions. To do so, we consider families of triangulations built out of
simplices with colored faces. Those simplices can be glued to form new building
blocks, called bubbles which are pseudo-manifolds with boundaries. Bubbles can
in turn be glued together to form triangulations. The main challenge is to
classify the triangulations built from a given set of bubbles with respect to
their numbers of bubbles and simplices of codimension two. While the colored
triangulations which maximize the number of simplices of codimension two at
fixed number of simplices are series-parallel objects called melonic
triangulations, this is not always true anymore when restricting attention to
colored triangulations built from specific bubbles. This opens up the
possibility of new universality classes of colored triangulations. We present
three existing strategies to find those universality classes. The first two
strategies consist in building new bubbles from old ones for which the problem
can be solved. The third strategy is a bijection between those colored
triangulations and stuffed, edge-colored maps, which are some sort of hypermaps
whose hyperedges are replaced with edge-colored maps. We then show that the
present approach can lead to enumeration results and identification of
universality classes, by working out the example of quartic tensor models. They
feature a tree-like phase, a planar phase similar to two-dimensional quantum
gravity and a phase transition between them which is interpreted as a
proliferation of baby universes.

of entanglement entropy synchronises with h(t), displaying an oscillatory
behaviour at the frequency of the driving. Synchronisation in the dynamics of
entanglement entropy, is spoiled by the appearance of quasi-revivals which fade
out in the thermodynamic limit, and which we interpret using a quasi-particle
picture adapted to periodic drivings. Taking the time-average of the
entanglement entropy in the synchronised regime, we find that it obeys a volume
law scaling with the subsystem's size. Such result is reminiscent of a thermal
state or of a Generalised Gibbs ensemble of a quenched Ising chain, although
the system does not heat up towards infinite temperature as a consequence of
the integrability of the model.

large-scale research infrastructures (RIs) and in basic research. Scientific
discoveries, which are expected thanks to RIs, may have a non-use value, in
analogy with environmental and cultural public goods. This paper provides, for
the first time, an empirical estimation of the willingness to pay (WTP) for
discoveries in basic research by the general public. We focus on the Large
Hadron Collider (LHC), the largest particle accelerator worldwide, where in
2012 the Higgs boson was discovered. Nobody knows the practical value of such
discovery, beyond knowledge per se. The findings of our study are based on a
dichotomous choice contingent valuation (CV) survey carried out in line with
the NOAA guidelines. The survey involved 1,022 undergraduate students enrolled
in more than 30 different degrees (including the humanities) at five
universities located in four countries (Italy, France, Spain, UK). We ask two
main research questions: Which are the determinants of the WTP for the LHC
discoveries? What is the average contribution that the respondents would be
willing to pay? Our results confirm that income, interest and attitudes towards
basic research are positively associated with the WTP, while other potential
explanatory variables play a limited role. The estimated mean of WTP for basic
research in particle physics is EUR 7.7 per person una-tantum. Although this is
a small amount compared to other CV studies for environmental and cultural
goods, it points to positive social attitudes for basic science as a public
good.

describes a single-component Bose gas with a resonant coupling to a diatomic

the eigenstates of the single-site reduced density matrix have structures that
are characteristic for the various quantum phases of this system. Since the
Hamiltonian conserves only the global particle number but not the number of
bosons and molecules individually, these eigenstates, referred to as optimal
modes, can be nontrivial linear combinations of bare eigenstates of the
molecular and boson particle number. We numerically analyze the optimal modes
and their weights, the latter giving the importance of the corresponding state,
in the ground state of the Bose-Bose resonance model. We find that the
single-site von Neumann entropy is sensitive to the location of the phase
boundaries. We explain the structure of the optimal modes and their weight
spectra using perturbation theory and via a comparison to results for the
single-component Bose-Hubbard model. We further study the dynamical evolution
of the optimal modes and of the single-site entanglement entropy in two quantum
quenches that cross phase boundaries of the model and show that these

evidences a relevant degree of isoscalar/isovector mixing of the collective

essentially corresponds to the excitation of isoscalar-like modes, which also
contribute to the isovector response owing to their mixed character.
Considering effective interactions which mostly differ in the isovector

probability.We then derive an easy-to-evaluate asymptotic average secrecy rate
and asymptotic secrecy outage probability when the number of antennas at the
secondary transmitter goes to infinity. Our results show that the equal power
allocation between the useful signal and artificial noise is not always the
best strategy to achieve maximum average secrecy rate in large scale spectrum
sharing networks. Another interesting observation is that the advantage of
beamforming and artificial noise generation over beamforming on the average
secrecy rate is lost when the aggregate interference from the primary and
secondary transmitters is strong, such that it overtakes the effect of the
generated artificial noise.

dynamics of charge states in electrostatically-defined metallic quantum dots.
Using the orthodox theory for computing the transfer rates and a master
equation, we model the dynamical response of devices consisting of a charge
sensor coupled to either a single and or a double quantum dot subjected to a
pulsed gate voltage. We show that transition rates between charge states in
metallic quantum dots are characterized by an asymmetry that can be controlled
by the gate voltage. This effect is more pronounced when the switching between
charge states corresponds to a Markovian process involving electron transport
through a chain of several quantum dots. By simulating the dynamics of electron
transport we demonstrate that the quantum box operates as a finite-state
machine that can be addressed by choosing suitable shapes and switching rates
of the gate pulses. We further show that writing times in the ns range and
retention memory times six orders of magnitude longer, in the ms range, can be
achieved on the double quantum dot system using experimentally feasible
parameters thereby demonstrating that the device can operate as a dynamic
single electron memory.

in Hall A, where a precision measurement of the twist-3 matrix element $d_2$ of
the neutron ($d_{2}^{n}$) was conducted. This quantity represents the average
color Lorentz force a struck quark experiences in a deep inelastic electron
scattering event off a neutron due to its interaction with the hadronizing
remnants. This color force was determined from a linear combination of the
third moments of the spin structure functions $g_1$ and $g_2$ on $^{3}$He after
nuclear corrections had been applied to these moments. The kinematics included
two average $Q^{2}$ bins of $3.2$ GeV$^{2}$ and $4.3$ GeV$^{2}$, and
Bjorken-$x$ $0.25 \leq x \leq 0.90$ covering the DIS and resonance regions. We
found $d_2^n$ to be small and negative for $<Q^{2}> = 3.2$ GeV$^{2}$, and
smaller for $<Q^{2}> = 4.3$ GeV$^{2}$, consistent with a lattice QCD
calculation. The twist-4 matrix element $f_{2}^{n}$ was extracted by combining
our $d_{2}^{n}$ with the world data on $\Gamma_{1}^{n} = \int_{0}^{1} g_{1}^{n}
dx$. We found $f_{2}^{n}$ to be roughly an order of magnitude larger than
$d_{2}^{n}$. Utilizing the extracted $d_{2}^{n}$ and $f_{2}^{n}$ data, we
separated the color force into its electric and magnetic components,
$F_{E}^{y,n}$ and $F_{B}^{y,n}$, and found them to be equal and opposite in
magnitude, in agreement with instanton model predictions but not with those
from QCD sum rules. Additionally, we have extracted the neutron virtual
photon-nucleon asymmetry $A_{1}^{n}$, the structure function ratio
$g_{1}^{n}/F_{1}^{n}$, and the quark ratios $(\Delta u + \Delta \bar{u})/(u +
\bar{u})$ and $(\Delta d + \Delta \bar{d})/(d + \bar{d})$. These results were
found to be consistent with DIS world data and with the prediction of the
constituent quark model but at odds with those of perturbative QCD at large
$x$.

dependent on previous movements. We use conditional random fields (CRF), a
graphical model for structured classification, to take advantage of
dependencies between activities in a sequence. However, CRFs do not consider
the negative effects of class imbalance during training. We propose a
class-wise dynamically weighted CRF (dWCRF) where weights are automatically
determined during training by maximizing the expected overall F-score. Our
results based on three case studies from a healthcare application using a
batteryless body worn sensor, demonstrate that our method, in general, improves
overall and minority class F-score when compared to other CRF based classifiers
and achieves similar or better overall and class-wise performance when compared
to SVM based classifiers under conditions of limited training data. We also
confirm the performance of our approach using an additional battery powered
body worn sensor dataset, achieving similar results in cases of high class
imbalance.

clearly have positive dependencies. For example, the airport delay time in New

delay time in Boston. With this motivation, we give an example of our model
class derived from the univariate exponential distribution that allows for
almost arbitrary positive and negative dependencies with only a mild condition
on the parameter matrix---a condition akin to the positive definiteness of the
Gaussian covariance matrix. Our Poisson generalization allows for both positive
and negative dependencies without any constraints on the parameter values. We
also develop parameter estimation methods using node-wise regressions with
$\ell_1$ regularization and likelihood approximation methods using sampling.
Finally, we demonstrate our exponential generalization on a synthetic dataset

corresponding relative sign. The proposed observables are based on triple
product (TP) correlations that we extract from the expression for the
differential cross section in terms of the spin vectors of the top and antitop
quarks. In order to explore other possibilities, we progressively modify these
TPs, first by combining them, and then by replacing the spin vectors by the
lepton momenta or the $t$ and $\bar{t}$ momenta by their visible parts. We
generate Monte Carlo data sets for several benchmark scenarios, including the
Standard Model ($\kappa_t=1$, $\tilde{\kappa}_t=0$) and two scenarios with
mixed $\mathrm{CP}$ properties ($\kappa_t=1$, $\tilde{\kappa}_t=\pm 1$).
Assuming an integrated luminosity that is consistent with that envisioned for
the High Luminosity Large Hadron Collider, using Monte Carlo-truth and taking
into account only statistical uncertainties, we find that the most promising
observable can disentangle the ""$\mathrm{CP}$-mixed"" scenarios with an
effective separation of $\sim 19\sigma$. In the case of observables that do not
require the reconstruction of the $t$ and $\bar{t}$ momenta, the power of
discrimination is up to $\sim 13\sigma$ for the same number of events. We also

quantum wells of conventional semiconductors like GaAs, as witnessed by the 50

translates into equivalently faster carrier-carrier Coulomb scattering of
excited carriers. Here we show that a combination of ab-initio band-structure

is less than an order of magnitude faster than in quantum wells. These

manifolds out of known ones. We observe that it occurs in natural phenomena
where a sphere of dimension 0 or 1 is selected, forces are applied and the
manifold in which they occur changes type. For example, 1-dimensional surgery
happens during chromosomal crossover, DNA recombination and when cosmic
magnetic lines reconnect, while 2-dimensional surgery happens in the formation
of tornadoes, in the phenomenon of Falaco solitons, in drop coalescence and in
the cell mitosis. Inspired by such phenomena, we introduce new theoretical
concepts which enhance topological surgery with the observed forces and
dynamics. To do this, we first extend the formal definition to a continuous
process caused by local forces. Next, for modeling phenomena which do not
happen on arcs or surfaces but are 2-dimensional or 3-dimensional, we fill in
the interior space by defining the notion of solid topological surgery. We
further introduce the notion of embedded surgery in $S^3$ for modeling
phenomena which involve more intrinsically the ambient space, such as the
appearance of knotting in DNA and phenomena where the causes and effect of the
process lies beyond the initial manifold, such as the formation of black holes.
Finally, we connect these new theoretical concepts with a dynamical system and
we present it as a model for both 2-dimensional 0-surgery and natural phenomena
exhibiting a `hole drilling' behavior. We hope that through this study,
topology and dynamics of many natural phenomena, as well as topological surgery
itself, will be better understood.

formulate and solve a model problem describing the accretion of an
incompressible elastic solid on a rigid sphere due to attachment of diffusing
free particles. One of the peculiar characteristics of this problem is that
accretion takes place on the interior surface that separates the body from its
support rather than on its exterior surface, and hence is responsible for
stress accumulation. Simultaneously, ablation takes place at the outer surface
where material is removed from the body. As the body grows, mechanical effects
associated with the build-up of stress and strain energy slow down accretion
and promote ablation. Eventually, the system reaches a point where internal
accretion is balanced by external ablation. The present study is concerned with
this stationary regime called ""treadmilling"".
  The principal ingredients of our model are: a nonstandard choice of the
reference configuration, which allows us to cope with the continually evolving
material structure; and a driving force and a kinetic law for
accretion/ablation that involves the difference in chemical potential, strain
energy and the radial stress. By combining these ingredients we arrive at an
algebraic system which governs the stationary treadmilling state. We establish
the conditions under which this system has a solution and we show that this
solution is unique. Moreover, by an asymptotic analysis we show that for small
beads the thickness of the solid is proportional to the radius of the support
and is strongly affected by the stiffness of the solid, whereas for large beads
the stiffness of the solid is essentially irrelevant, the thickness being
proportional to a characteristic length that depends on the parameters that
govern diffusion and accretion kinetics.

radius, encompassing the convective nuclear-burning core (about 23\% by radius)
and a portion of the overlying radiative envelope. Eight rotation rates are
considered, ranging from 0.05\% to 16\% of the surface breakup velocity,
thereby capturing both convection that barely senses the effects of rotation
and other situations in which the Coriolis forces are prominent. The vigorous
dynamo action realized within all of these turbulent convective cores builds
magnetic fields with peak strengths exceeding a megagauss, with the overall
magnetic energy (ME) in the faster rotators reaching super-equipartition levels
compared to the convective kinetic energy (KE). The core convection typically
involves turbulent columnar velocity structures roughly aligned with the
rotation axis, with magnetic fields threading through these rolls and
possessing complex linkages throughout the core. The very strong fields are
able to coexist with the flows without quenching them through Lorentz forces.
The velocity and magnetic fields achieve such a state by being nearly
co-aligned, and with peak magnetic islands being somewhat displaced from the
fastest flows as the intricate evolution proceeds. As the rotation rate is
increased, the primary force balance shifts from nonlinear advection balancing
Lorentz forces to a magnetostrophic balance between Coriolis and Lorentz
forces.

show that this class of models can be fermionized with the help of the
algebraic properties of the su$(1|1)$ permutation operator, and take advantage
of this fact to analyze their quantum criticality when a chemical potential
term is present in the Hamiltonian. We first study the low energy excitations
and the low temperature behavior of the free energy, which coincides with that
of a $(1+1)$-dimensional conformal field theory (CFT) with central charge $c=1$
when the chemical potential lies in the critical interval $(0,\mathcal
E(\pi))$, $\mathcal E(p)$ being the dispersion relation. We also analyze the
von Neumann and R\'enyi ground state entanglement entropies, showing that they
exhibit the logarithmic scaling with the size of the block of spins
characteristic of a one-boson $(1+1)$-dimensional CFT. Our results thus show
that the models under study are quantum critical when the chemical potential
belongs to the critical interval, with central charge $c=1$. From the analysis
of the fermion density at zero temperature, we also conclude that there is a
quantum phase transition at both ends of the critical interval. This is further
confirmed by the behavior of the fermion density at finite temperature, which
is studied analytically (at low temperature), as well as numerically for the

Saliency estimation in this scenario is highly important since in the near

can be explained, on the one hand, by the dramatic improvement of 3D-capable

3D display technologies, most of the 3D displays are still expensive and
require wearing special glasses. To evaluate the performance of our approach,
we present a new comprehensive database of eye-fixation ground-truth for RGBD

exhibit ""intervality"": species can generally be ordered along a single axis in
such a way that the prey of any given predator tend to lie on unbroken compact
intervals. Although the meaning of this axis -- identified with a ""niche""
dimension -- has remained a mystery, it is assumed to lie at the basis of the
highly non-trivial structure of food webs. With this in mind, most trophic
network modelling has for decades been based on assigning species a niche value
by hand. However, we argue here that intervality should not be considered the
cause but rather a consequence of food-web structure. First, analysing a set of
$46$ empirical food webs, we find that they also exhibit {\it predator}
intervality: the predators of any given species are as likely to be contiguous
as the prey are, but in a different ordering. Furthermore, this property is not
exclusive of trophic networks: several networks of genes, neurons, metabolites,
cellular machines, airports, and words are found to be approximately as
interval as food webs. We go on to show that a simple model of food-web
assembly which does not make use of a niche axis can nevertheless generate
significant intervality. Therefore, the niche dimension (in the sense used for
food-web modelling) could in fact be the consequence of other, more fundamental
structural traits, such as trophic coherence. We conclude that a new approach
to food-web modelling is required for a deeper understanding of ecosystem
assembly, structure and function, and propose that certain topological features
thought to be specific of food webs are in fact common to many complex
networks.

involves the Lyman spectrum of hydrogen atoms. Thus, it appears necessary to
study the concepts introduced by a standard spectroscopy of quasars, studied
here, with those deducted from $\Lambda$-CDM.A visible absorption of a sharp
and saturated spectral line in a gas requires a long path without perturbations
as collisions or cosmological redshift. Spectra of absorbed, saturated lines of
quasars obeying Karlsson's law mainly result from interactions of natural,
thermal light radiated by quasar with relatively cold, low presure atomic
hydrogen. These lines are produced by three processes: a) A conventional
absorption in a relatively cold gas produces a set of lines; b) These lines are
multiplied by absorption after fundamental 3K or 4K redshifts, where K is
Karlsson's constant: Spectra show that redshifts 3K (or 4K) exactly bring
absorbed Lyman beta (or gamma) line on Lyman alpha: redshift almost disappears,
and gas lines are intensely absorbed in the absence of alpha absorption; c)
Redshifts occur in regions where light at alpha frequency is poorly absorbed
due to permanent redshift, except when excitation of hydrogen to 2P level is
sufficient for a superradiant flash emission at alpha frequency. This causes an
intense absorption of high radiance rays from quasar, so the absorption of a
line at current Lyman alpha frequency. Lightning and pumping produce relaxation
oscillations that write many absorption lines. Redshifts by H atoms in 2P
levels are due to parametric interactions composed of Impulsive Stimulated
Raman Scatterings (ISRS): excited hydrogen atoms catalyze energy exchanges
between observed ray and background cold thermal radiation, in agreement with
thermodynamics. Description of Universe becomes much simpler, but less
marvelous.
