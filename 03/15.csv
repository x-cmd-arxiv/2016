three-dimensional (3D) Bi$_2$Se$_3$ films to $\sim$ 30 meV above the Dirac

magnetic fields with high-precision time-domain terahertz polarimetry. For

experimentally on the kagome and pyrochlore lattices. Thermal Hall conductivity
$\kappa^{xy}$, changes sign as a function of magnetic field or temperature on
the kagome lattice, and $\kappa^{xy}$ changes sign upon reversing the sign of
the magnetic field on the pyrochlore lattice. Motivated by these recent
exciting experimental observations, we theoretically propose a simple
realization of magnon Hall effect in a two-band model on the honeycomb lattice.
The magnon Hall effect of spin excitations arises in the usual way via the
breaking of inversion symmetry of the lattice, however, by a
next-nearest-neighbour Dzyaloshinsky-Moriya (DM) interaction. We find that
$\kappa^{xy}$ has a fixed sign for all parameter regimes considered. These
results are in contrast to the Lieb, kagome and pyrochlore lattices. We further
show that the low-temperature dependence on the magnon Hall conductivity
follows a $T^{2}$ law, as opposed to the kagome and pyrochlore lattices. These
results suggest an experimental procedure to measure thermal Hall conductivity

exhibit behaviour of Brownian motion rather different from that of high
symmetry particles because convenient tracking points (TPs) are usually
inconsistent with the center of hydrodynamic stress (CoH) where the
translational and rotational motions are decoupled. In this paper we study the
effects of the translation-rotation coupling on the displacement probability
distribution functions (PDFs) of the boomerang colloid particles with symmetric
arms. By tracking the motions of different points on the particle symmetry
axis, we show that as the distance between the TP and the CoH is increased, the
effects of translation-rotation coupling becomes pronounced, making the
short-time 2D PDF for fixed initial orientation to change from elliptical to
crescent shape and the angle averaged PDFs from ellipsoidal-particle-like PDF
to a shape with a Gaussian top and long displacement tails. We also observed
that at long times the PDFs revert to Gaussian. This crescent shape of 2D PDF
provides a clear physical picture of the non-zero mean displacements observed
in boomerangs particles.

connectivity while coping with the ongoing traffic growth. It is of paramount
importance that the required resources, such as energy and bandwidth, do not
scale with traffic. While the aggregate network traffic is growing at an
unprecedented rate, users tend to request the same popular contents at
different time instants. Therefore, caching the most popular contents at the
network edge is a promising solution to reduce the traffic and the energy
consumption over the backhaul links. In this paper, two scenarios are
considered, where caching is performed either at a small base station, or
directly at the user terminals, which communicate using \ac{D2D}
communications. In both scenarios, joint design of the transmission and caching
policies is studied when the user demands are known in advance. This joint
design offers two different caching gains, namely, the \textit{pre-downloading}
and \textit{local caching gains}. It is shown that the finite cache capacity
limits the attainable gains, and creates an inherent tradeoff between the two
types of gains. In this context, a continuous time optimization problem is
formulated to determine the optimal transmission and caching policies that
minimize a generic cost function, such as energy, bandwidth, or throughput. The
jointly optimal solution is obtained by demonstrating that caching files at a
constant rate is optimal, which allows to reformulate the problem as a
finite-dimensional convex program. The numerical results show that the proposed
joint transmission and caching policy dramatically reduces the total cost,
which is particularised to the total energy consumption at the \ac{MBS}, as
well as to the total economical cost for the service provider, when users
demand economical incentives for delivering content to other users over the D2D

multiscale gravitational energy distribution using the observed surface density
PDF. Our analytical formalism also enables one to convert the observed column
density PDF into an estimated volume density PDF, and to obtain average radial
density profile $\rho(r)$. For a region with $N_{\rm col} \sim N^{-\gamma_{\rm
N}}$, the gravitational energy spectra is $E_{\rm p}(k)\sim k^{-4(1 -
1/\gamma_{\rm N})}$. We apply the formula to observations of molecular clouds,
and find that a scaling index of $-2$ of the surface density PDF implies that
$\rho \sim r^{-2}$ and $E_{\rm p}(k) \sim k^{-2}$. The results are valid from
the cloud scale (a few parsec) to around $\sim 0.1 \;\rm pc$. Because of the
resemblance the scaling index of the gravitational energy spectrum and the that
of the kinetic energy power spectrum of the Burgers turbulence (where $E\sim
k^{-2}$), our result indicates that gravity can act effectively against
turbulence over a multitude of physical scales. This is the critical scaling
index which divides molecular clouds into two categories: clouds like Orion and
Ophiuchus have shallower power laws, and the amount of gravitational energy is
too large for turbulence to be effective inside the cloud. Because gravity
dominates, we call this type of cloud g-type clouds. On the other hand, clouds
like the California molecular cloud and the Pipe nebula have steeper power
laws, and turbulence can overcome gravity if it can cascade effectively from
the large scale. We call this type of cloud t-type clouds. The analytical
formula can be used to determine if gravity is dominating cloud evolution when
the column density probability distribution function (PDF) can be reliably
determined.

maximum-likelihood positive operator-valued measure (ML-POVM) for pure

probability and the mean fidelity are used as the figures of merit to show its
performance. The POVM is found to attain the collective bound of polarization
estimation with respect to the mean fidelity. As demonstrations, explicit
results for the N photon Fock state, the phase-randomized coherent state
(Poisson distribution), and the thermal light are obtained. It is found that
the estimation performances for the Fock state and the Poisson distribution are
almost identical, while that for the thermal light is much worse. This suggests
that thermal light leaks less information to an eavesdropper and hence could
potentially provide more security in polarization-encoded quantum communication
protocols than a single-mode laser beam as customarily considered. Finally,
comparisons against an optimal adaptive measurement with classical
communications are made to show the better and more stable performance of the
continuous ML-POVM.

differential equation (PDE) onto the tangent space of the chosen family, thus
obtaining an ordinary differential equation for the family parameter. A second
global approximation will be based on projecting directly the exact solution
from its infinite dimensional space to the chosen family using the nonlinear
metric projection. This will result in matching expectations with respect to
the exact and approximating densities for particular functions associated with
the chosen family, but this will require knowledge of the exact solution of
FPK. A first way around this is a localized version of the metric projection
based on the assumed density approximation. While the localization will remove
global optimality, we will show that the somewhat arbitrary assumed density
approximation is equivalent to the mathematically rigorous vector field
projection. More interestingly we study the case where the approximating family
is defined based on a number of eigenfunctions of the exact equation. In this
case we show that the local vector field projection provides also the globally
optimal approximation in metric projection, and for some families this

$J$-$Q$ model, as a function of an external magnetic field. In this model, $J$
represents the traditional antiferromagnetic Heisenberg exchange and $Q$ is the
strength of a competing four-spin interaction. Without external field, this
system hosts a twofold-degenerate dimerized (valence-bond solid) state above a
critical value $q_c\approx 0.85$ where $q\equiv Q/J$. The dimer order is
destroyed and replaced by a partially polarized translationally invariant state
at a critical field value. We find magnetization jumps (metamagnetism) between
the partially polarized and fully polarized state for $q>q_{\rm min}$, where we
have calculated $q_{\rm min}=2/9$ exactly. For $q>q_{\rm min}$ two magnons
(flipped spins on a fully polarized background) attract and form a bound state.
Quantum Monte Carlo studies confirm that the bound state corresponds to the
first step of an instability leading to a finite magnetization jump for
$q>q_{\rm min}$. Our results show that neither geometric frustration nor
spin-anisotropy are necessary conditions for metamagnetism. Working in the
two-magnon subspace, we also find evidence pointing to the existence of
metamagnetism in the unfrustrated $J_1$-$J_2$ chain ($J_1>0$, $J_2<0$), but
only if $J_2$ is spin-anisotropic. We also investigate quantum-critical scaling
near the transition into the fully polarized state for $q\le q_{\rm min}$ at
$T>0$. While the expected `zero-scale-factor' universality is clearly seen for
$q=0$ and $q\ll q_{\rm min}$; closer to $q_{\rm min}$ we find that extremely
low temperatures are required to observe the asymptotic behavior, due to the
influence of the tricritical point at $q_{\rm min}$, which leads to a
cross-over at a temperature $T^*(q)$ between logarithmic tricritical scaling
and zero-scale-factor universality, with $T^*(q)\to 0$ when $q\to q_{\rm min}$.

an EM algorithm that returns the MAP estimate of the set of relevant variables.
Due to its particular updating scheme, our algorithm can be implemented
efficiently without inverting a large matrix in each iteration and therefore
can scale up with big data. We also show that the MAP estimate returned by our

problem with EM algorithms. To address this issue, we propose an ensemble EM

were irradiated with high intensity femtosecond and picosecond laser pulses
with ultra-high contrast. To determine the temporal evolution and the spatial

developed further and applied in two different imaging configurations. It
enabled us to gather complementary information about the investigated field

A modification and combination of the two models allowed for an extensive and

femtoseconds to 2.7 picoseconds led to a transition of the dominating force

re-investigated. The magnetization $M(T)$, specific heat $C_p(T)$ and the
resistivity $\rho(T)$ reveal a double-phase transition -- at $T_{N1}\sim$ 10~K
and at $T_{N2}\sim$ 8.8~K -- which was not observed in the previous report on
this compound. The antiferromagnetic transition is also visible in the thermal
transport data, thereby suggesting a close connection between the electronic
and lattice degrees of freedom in this Sn-based quasi-skutterudite. The
temperature dependence of $\rho(T)$ is analyzed in terms of a power-law for
resistivity pertinent to Fermi liquid picture. Giant, positive
magnetoresistance (MR) $\approx$ 80$\%$ is observed in Gd$_3$Ir$_4$Sn$_{13}$ at
2~K with the application of 9~T. The giant MR and the double magnetic
transition can be attributed to the quasi-cages and layered antiferromagnetic
structure of Gd$_3$Ir$_4$Sn$_{13}$ vulnerable to structural distortions and/or
dipolar or spin-reorientation effects. The giant value of MR observed in this
class of 3:4:13 type alloys, especially in a Gd-compound, is the highlight of

sequence of elementary edit operations, namely substitutions, removals and
insertions of elements. Each possible edit operation is penalized by a
non-negative cost and the cost of a transformation is measured by summing the
costs of its operations. A solution to this problem consists in defining a
transformation having a minimal cost, among all possible transformations. To
compute such a solution, the classical approach consists in representing
removal and insertion operations by augmenting the two sets so that they get
the same size. This allows to express the problem as a linear sum assignment
problem (LSAP), which thus finds an optimal bijection (or permutation, perfect
matching) between the two augmented sets. While the LSAP is known to be
efficiently solvable in polynomial time complexity, for instance with the
Hungarian algorithm, useless time and memory are spent to treat the elements
which have been added to the initial sets. In this report, we show that the
problem can be formalized as an extension of the LSAP which considers only one
additional element in each set to represent removal and insertion operations. A
solution to the problem is no longer represented as a bijection between the two
augmented sets. We show that the considered problem is a binary linear program
(BLP) very close to the LSAP. While it can be solved by any BLP solver, we
propose an adaptation of the Hungarian algorithm which improves the time and
memory complexities previously obtained by the approach based on the LSAP. The
importance of the improvement increases as the size of the two sets and their
absolute difference increase. Based on the analysis of the problem presented in
this report, other classical algorithms can be adapted.

Fourier-transform diffraction pattern of a complex amplitude sample can be
achieved at Fresnel region and the amplitude and phase distributions of a

X-ray Fourier-transform ghost imaging extends X-ray crystallography to

wavelength of the X-ray, thus atomic resolution should be routinely obtainable.
Since highly coherent X-ray source is not required, comparing to conventional

laboratory X-ray sources, and it also provides a potential solution for

existence of gapless states at domain walls created in gated bilayer graphene,
when the sublattice stacking is changed from AB to BA. These states are
significant because they are topologically protected, valley-polarized and give
rise to conductance along the domain wall. Current theoretical models predict
the appearance of such states only at domain walls, which preserve the
sublattice order. Here we show that the appearance of the topologically
protected states in stacking domain walls can be much more common in bilayer
graphene, since they can also emerge in unexpected geometries, e.g., at grain
boundaries with atomic-scale topological defects. We focus on a bilayer system
in which one of the layers contains a line of octagon-double pentagon defects,
that mix graphene sublattices. We demonstrate that gap states are preserved
even with pentagonal defects. Remarkably, unlike previous predictions, the
number of gap states changes by inverting the gate polarization, yielding an
asymmetric conductance along the grain boundary under gate reversal. This
effect, linked to defect states, should be detectable in transport measurements
and could be exploited in electrical switches.

those in plastic bag production, where the brushes act as slip agents; however,
the complex mechanisms that give rise to such reduction of friction are not yet
fully understood. In this work we report coarse grained, dissipative particle
dynamics simulations carried out for surfaces functionalized with erukamide
brushes, a polymer commonly used in the plastics industry as a slip agent
between surfaces. We calculate their rheological properties, such as the
coefficient of friction (COF) and the viscosity, {\eta}, as functions of the
number of chains grafted on the surfaces under the influence of stationary,
Couette flow. Moreover, we consider also the case when a fraction of the
erukamide chains is not adsorbed and moves freely between the surfaces. We show
that the COF reaches an equilibrium value of about 0.29 in these two cases, in
agreement with experimental results. On other hand, the viscosity grows
monotonically, as a result of the increasing collisions when the erukamide
content is increased. The force between brushes is found to be in agreement
with predictions from scaling theories. We find that the addition to free
chains helps stabilize the film formed by the brushes and the solvent, as
others have found experimentally. The mechanisms that give rise to these
phenomena are studied in detail.

We aim to obtain the orbital ephemeris, the orbital period of the system, as
well as its derivative to compare the observed luminosity with that predicted

201.6543\degree and DEC (J2000)= -62.1358\degree with an associated error of
0.0002\degree, and confirm the detection of the IR counterpart already
discussed in literature. We estimate an orbital period of P=2.9419156(6) hrs

accuracy ten times higher. We also obtain a constraint on the orbital period
derivative for the first time, estimating $\dot{P}=(8\pm 13)\times 10^{-12}$

main sequence, and is a neutron star of 1.4 M$_{\odot}$, we infer a mass of
0.28$\pm$0.03 M$_{\odot}$ for the companion star. Assuming a distance of 10

the alpha-beta-gamma (ABG) model, the close-in (CI) free space reference

models using measured data from 30 propagation measurement datasets from 2 GHz
to 73 GHz over distances ranging from 4 m to 1238 m. A series of sensitivity
analyses of the three models show that the physically-based two-parameter CI
model and three-parameter CIF model offer computational simplicity, have very
similar goodness of fit (i.e., the shadow fading standard deviation), exhibit
more stable model parameter behavior across frequencies and distances, and
yield smaller prediction error in sensitivity testing across distances and
frequencies, when compared to the four-parameter ABG model. Results show the CI
model with a 1 m close-in reference distance is suitable for outdoor
environments, while the CIF model is more appropriate for indoor modeling. The
CI and CIF models are easily implemented in existing 3GPP models by making a
very subtle modification -- by replacing a floating non-physically based
constant with a frequency-dependent constant that represents free space path
loss in the first meter of propagation.

expansion in small density fluctuations, usually written in terms of

establish a new method to numerically evaluate the 1-loop power spectrum (i.e.,
Fourier transform of the 2-point correlation function) with one-dimensional

This fast model evaluation can in principle be extended to higher loop order
where existing codes become painfully slow. Our approach follows by writing
higher order corrections to the 2-point correlation function as, e.g., the
correlation between two second-order fields or the correlation between a linear
and a third-order field. These are then decomposed into products of
correlations of linear fields and derivatives of linear fields. The method can
also be viewed as evaluating three-dimensional Fourier space convolutions using
products in configuration space, which may also be useful in other contexts

unconfirmed family candidates with short-term variability studies, and report
the most complete review to date. We present results based on five years of

seven candidates. The mean rotational periods, from Maxwellian fits to the
frequency distributions, are 6.27+/-1.19 h for the confirmed family members,
6.44+/-1.16 h for the candidates, and 7.65+/-0.54 h for other TNOs (without

Haumea family members rotate faster than other TNOs, however, the sample of
family member is still too limited for a secure conclusion. We also highlight
the fast rotation of 2002 GH32. This object has a 0.36+/-0.02 mag amplitude
lightcurve and a rotational period of about 3.98 h. Assuming 2002 GH32 is a
triaxial object in hydrostatic equilibrium, we derive a lower limit to the
density of 2.56 g cm^-3. This density is similar to Haumea's and much more

with basic principles in quantum mechanics. Statistical mechanics relies on the
maximization of entropy for a system at thermal equilibrium. However, an
isolated many-body system initialized in a pure state will remain pure during
Schr\""{o}dinger evolution, and in this sense has static, zero entropy. The
underlying role of quantum mechanics in many-body physics is then seemingly
antithetical to the success of statistical mechanics in a large variety of

a quantum state, and observe the fundamental role of quantum entanglement in
facilitating this emergence. We perform microscopy on an evolving quantum
system, and we see thermalization occur on a local scale, while we measure that
the full quantum state remains pure. We directly measure entanglement entropy
and observe how it assumes the role of the thermal entropy in thermalization.
Although the full state remains measurably pure, entanglement creates local
entropy that validates the use of statistical physics for local observables. In
combination with number-resolved, single-site imaging, we demonstrate how our
measurements of a pure quantum state agree with the Eigenstate Thermalization

A Boolean network is conjunctive if the associated value update rule is
comprised of only AND operations. It is known that any trajectory of a finite
dynamical system will enter a periodic orbit. We characterize in this paper all
periodic orbits of a conjunctive Boolean network whose underlying graph is
strongly connected. In particular, we establish a bijection between the set of
periodic orbits and the set of binary necklaces of a certain length. We further

trajectory, with the perturbed state being the initial condition, will enter
another (possibly the same) periodic orbit in finite time steps. We then
provide a complete characterization of all such transitions from one periodic

between demand and supply for service quality with minimum current and
anticipated future taxi idle driving distance. Extensive trace-driven analysis
with a data set containing taxi operational records in San Francisco shows that
our solution reduces the average total idle distance by 52%, and reduces the
supply demand ratio error across the city during one experimental time slot by
45%. Moreover, our RHC framework is compatible with a wide variety of
predictive models and optimization problem formulations. This compatibility
property allows us to solve robust optimization problems with corresponding
demand uncertainty models that provide disruptive event information.

the Galaxy to the MCs infall, the dynamical friction experienced by the MCs and
the disruption of the MC satellites by their hosts. The simulation suite
samples over the uncertainties in the MC's proper motions, the masses of the MW

density distribution of the MC satellites. As a result, we can accurately
reproduce the DES satellites' observed positions and kinematics. Assuming that
Milky Way (MW) dwarfs follow the distribution of subhaloes in $\Lambda$CDM, we
further demonstrate that, of 14 observed satellites, the MW halo contributes
fewer than 4 (8) of these with 68% (95%) confidence and that 7 (12) DES dwarfs
have probabilities greater than 0.7 (0.5) of belonging to the LMC.

show that the Clouds have likely endured only one Galactic pericentric passage

gaining more influence and popularity by growing their set of followers, aka
their audience. Several studies have described the properties of users on
Twitter based on static snapshots of their follower network. Other studies have
analyzed the general process of link formation. Here, rather than investigating
the dynamics of this process itself, we study how the characteristics of the
audience and follower links change as the audience of a user grows in size on
the road to user's popularity.
  To begin with, we find that the early followers tend to be more elite users
than the late followers, i.e., they are more likely to have verified and expert
accounts. Moreover, the early followers are significantly more similar to the
person that they follow than the late followers. Namely, they are more likely
to share time zone, language, and topics of interests with the followed user.
To some extent, these phenomena are related with the growth of Twitter itself,
wherein the early followers tend to be the early adopters of Twitter, while the
late followers are late adopters. We isolate, however, the effect of the growth
of audiences consisting of followers from the growth of Twitter's user base
itself. Finally, we measure the engagement of such audiences with the content
of the followed user, by measuring the probability that an early or late
follower becomes a retweeter.

  Proceedings of the 10th International AAAI Conference on Web and Social Media",,,,"cs.SI cs.CY physics.soc-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  A number of recent studies of information diffusion in social media, both
empirical and theoretical, have been inspired by viral propagation models
derived from epidemiology. These studies model the propagation of memes, i.e.,
pieces of information, between users in a social network similarly to the way
diseases spread in human society. Importantly, one would expect a meme to
spread in a social network amongst the people who are interested in the topic
of that meme. Yet, the importance of topicality for information diffusion has
been less explored in the literature.
  Here, we study empirical data about two different types of memes (hashtags
and URLs) spreading through the Twitter's online social network. For every
meme, we infer its topics and for every user, we infer her topical interests.
To analyze the impact of such topics on the propagation of memes, we introduce
a novel theoretical framework of information diffusion. Our analysis identifies
two distinct mechanisms, namely topical and non-topical, of information
diffusion. The non-topical information diffusion resembles disease spreading as
in simple contagion. In contrast, the topical information diffusion happens
between users who are topically aligned with the information and has
characteristics of complex contagion. Non-topical memes spread broadly among
all users and end up being relatively popular. Topical memes spread narrowly
among users who have interests topically aligned with them and are diffused
more readily after multiple exposures. Our results show that the topicality of
memes and users' interests are essential for understanding and predicting
information diffusion.

original TO by a $\mathbb{Z}_2$ gauge theory sector coming from the s-wave SC.
We first determine the extended TO for a wide variety of fractional quantum
Hall or fractional Chern insulator heterostructures. We prove the existence of
a general anyon permutation symmetry (AS) that exists in any fermionic Abelian
TO state in contact with an s-wave superconductor. Physically this permutation
corresponds to adding a fermion to an odd flux vortices (in units of $h/2e$) as
they travel around the associated topological (twist) defect. As such, we call
it a fermion parity flip AS. We consider twist defects which mutate anyons
according to the fermion parity flip symmetry and show that they can be
realized at domain walls between distinct gapped edges or interfaces of the TO
superconducting state. We analyze the properties of such defects and show that
fermion parity flip twist defects are always associated with Majorana zero
modes. Our formalism also reproduces known results such as
Majorana/parafermionic bound states at superconducting domain walls of
topological/Fractional Chern insulators when twist defects are constructed

massive $>10^{11} M_\odot$ galaxies in simultaneous, short-lived bursts of
activity well before virialization. This conclusion is reached from emerging
datasets on $z>2$ proto-clusters and the characteristics of their member
galaxies, in particular, rare starbursts and ultraluminous active galactic
nuclei (AGN). The most challenging observational hurdle in identifying such
structures is their very large volumes, $\sim10^{4}$ comoving Mpc$^3$ at $z>2$,
subtending areas $\sim$half a degree on the sky. Thus the contrast afforded by
an overabundance of very rare galaxies in comparison to the background can more
easily distinguish overdense structures from the surrounding, normal density
field. Five $2<z<3$ proto-clusters from the literature are discussed in detail
and are found to contain up to 12 dusty starbursts or luminous AGN galaxies
each, a phenomenon that is unlikely to occur by chance even in overdense
environments. Measurements of gas depletion times suggest that they are indeed
short-lived on $\sim$100 Myr timescales, and the probability of finding a
structure containing more than 8 such systems is $\sim$0.2\%, unless their
`triggering' is correlated on very large spatial scales, $\sim$10 Mpc across.
The volume density of starburst-rich proto-clusters is found to be comparable
to all $>10^{15} M_\odot$ galaxy clusters in the nearby Universe, a factor of
five larger than expected in some simulations. Some tension yet exists between
measurements of their volume density of starburst-rich proto-clusters and the
expectation that they are generated via short-lived episodes. However, improved
observations of proto-clusters over large regions of sky will certainly shed
more light on the assembly of galaxy clusters, and whether or not they build
their galaxies through episodic bursts as suggested here. [abridged]

galaxies potentially provide key insights in to the morphology, energetics and
spectrum of these powerful radio sources. However, limitations imposed by the
previous generation of radio interferometers at metre wavelengths has meant
that this region of parameter space remains largely unexplored. In this paper,
the first in a series examining FR IIs at low frequencies, we use LOFAR
observations between 50 and 160 MHz, along with complementary archival radio
and X-ray data, to explore the properties of two FR II sources, 3C452 and
3C223. We find that the morphology of 3C452 is that of a standard FR II rather
than of a double-double radio galaxy as had previously been suggested, with no
remnant emission being observed beyond the active lobes. We find that the
low-frequency integrated spectra of both sources are much steeper than expected
based on traditional assumptions and, using synchrotron/inverse-Compton model
fitting, show that the total energy content of the lobes is greater than
previous estimates by a factor of around 5 for 3C452 and 2 for 3C223. We go on
to discuss possible causes of these steeper than expected spectra and provide
revised estimates of the internal pressures and magnetic field strengths for
the intrinsically steep case. We find that the ratio between the equipartition
magnetic field strengths and those derived through synchrotron/inverse-Compton
model fitting remains consistent with previous findings and show that the
observed departure from equipartition may in some cases provide a solution to
the spectral versus dynamical age disparity.

within the cosmic web of large-scale structure. Unfortunately, the cosmic web
has only been extensively mapped at low-redshifts ($z<1$), using galaxy
redshifts as tracers of the underlying density field. At $z>1$, the required
galaxy densities are inaccessible for the foreseeable future, but 3D
reconstructions of Lyman-$\alpha$ forest absorption in closely-separated
background QSOs and star-forming galaxies already offer a detailed window into
$z\sim2-3$ large-scale structure. We quantify the utility of such maps for
studying the cosmic web by using realistic $z=2.5$ Ly$\alpha$ forest
simulations matched to observational properties of upcoming surveys. A
deformation tensor-based analysis is used to classify voids, sheets, filaments
and nodes in the flux, which is compared to those determined from the
underlying dark matter field. We find an extremely good correspondence, with
$70\%$ of the volume in the flux maps correctly classified relative to the dark
matter web, and $99\%$ classified to within 1 eigenvalue. This compares
favorably to the performance of galaxy-based classifiers with even the highest
galaxy densities at low-redshift. We find that narrow survey geometries can
degrade the cosmic web recovery unless the survey is $\gtrsim
60\,h^{-1}\,\mathrm{Mpc}$ or $\gtrsim 1\,\mathrm{deg}$ on the sky. We also
examine halo abundances as a function of the cosmic web, and find a clear
dependence as a function of flux overdensity, but little explicit dependence on
the cosmic web. These methods will provide a new window on cosmological
environments of galaxies at this very special time in galaxy formation, ""high
noon"", and on overall properties of cosmological structures at this epoch.

used to measure dynamical masses. Recently, several analytical relationships
between the stellar line-of-sight velocity dispersion, the projected (2D) or
deprojected (3D) half-light radius, and the total mass enclosed within the
half-light radius, relying on the spherical Jeans equation, have been proposed.
Here, we make use of the APOSTLE cosmological hydrodynamical simulations of the
Local Group to test the validity and accuracy of such mass estimators for both
dispersion and rotation-supported galaxies, for field and satellite galaxies,
and for galaxies of varying masses, shapes, and velocity dispersion
anisotropies. We find that the mass estimators of Walker et al. and Wolf et al.
are able to recover the masses of dispersion-dominated systems with little
systematic bias, but with a 1-sigma scatter of 25 and 23 percent, respectively.
The error on the estimated mass is dominated by the impact of the 3D shape of
the stellar mass distribution, which is difficult to constrain observationally.
This intrinsic scatter becomes the dominant source of uncertainty in the masses
estimated for galaxies like the dwarf spheroidal (dSph) satellites of the Milky
Way, where the observational errors in their sizes and velocity dispersions are
small. Such scatter may also affect the inner density slopes of dSphs derived
from multiple stellar populations, relaxing the significance with which
Navarro-Frenk-White profiles may be excluded, depending on the degree to which
the relevant properties of the different stellar populations are correlated.
Finally, we derive a new optimal mass estimator that removes the residual
biases and achieves a statistically significant reduction in the scatter to 20
percent overall for dispersion-dominated galaxies, allowing more precise and
accurate mass estimates.

consume a wide variety of information and ideas. In these sites, users
typically choose their information sources, which in turn determine what
specific information they receive, how much information they receive and how
quickly this information is shown to them. In this context, a natural question
that arises is how efficient are social media users at selecting their
information sources.
  In this work, we propose a computational framework to quantify users'
efficiency at selecting information sources. Our framework is based on the
assumption that the goal of users is to acquire a set of unique pieces of
information. To quantify user's efficiency, we ask if the user could have
acquired the same pieces of information from another set of sources more
efficiently. We define three different notions of efficiency -- link, in-flow,
and delay -- corresponding to the number of sources the user follows, the
amount of (redundant) information she acquires and the delay with which she
receives the information. Our definitions of efficiency are general and
applicable to any social media system with an underlying information network,
in which every user follows others to receive the information they produce.
  In our experiments, we measure the efficiency of Twitter users at acquiring
different types of information. We find that Twitter users exhibit sub-optimal
efficiency across the three notions of efficiency, although they tend to be
more efficient at acquiring non-popular than popular pieces of information. We
then show that this lack of efficiency is a consequence of the triadic closure
mechanism by which users typically discover and follow other users in social
media. Finally, we develop a heuristic algorithm that enables users to be
significantly more efficient at acquiring the same unique pieces of
information.

dimension 4 is a Chern-Simons action for a superconnection taking its values in
a direct product of an infinite-dimensional algebra of oscillators and a
Frobenius algebra. A crucial ingredient of the model is that it elevates the
rigid closed and central two-form of Vasiliev's theory to a dynamical 2-form
and doubles the higher-spin algebra, thereby considerably reducing the number
of possible higher spin invariants and giving a nonzero effective functional
on-shell. The two action principles we give for higher-spin systems in 3D are
based on Chern-Simons and BF models. In the first case, the theory we give
unifies higher-spin gauge fields with fractional-spin fields and an internal
sector. In particular, Newton's constant is related to the coupling constant of
the internal sector. In the second case, the BF action we review gives the
fully nonlinear Prokushkin-Vasiliev, bosonic equations for matter-coupled
higher spins in 3D. We present the truncation to a single, real matter field

the method is parameter-free, in the sense that all but one solution-dependent
constants appearing in the upper and lower bound estimates are explicitly
computable by solving local and independent eigenvalue problems, and the only
non-computable constant can be reasonably approximated by a computable one

Compared to the PDE case, we find that a posteriori error estimators for
eigenvalue problems must neglect certain terms, which involves explicitly the
exact eigenvalues or eigenfunctions that are not accessible in numerical
simulations. We define such terms carefully, and justify numerically that the
neglected terms are indeed numerically high order terms compared to the
computable estimators. Numerical results for a variety of problems in 1D and 2D

V404 Cyg during its 2015 June outburst. Simultaneous three-band observations
with the ULTRACAM fast imager on four nights show steep power spectra dominated
by slow variations on ~100-1000s timescales. Near the peak of the outburst on
June 26, a dramatic change occurs and additional, persistent sub-second optical
flaring appears close in time to giant radio and X-ray flaring. The flares
reach peak optical luminosities of ~few x 10^{36} erg/s. Some are unresolved
down to a time resolution of 24 milliseconds. Whereas the fast flares are
stronger in the red, the slow variations are bluer when brighter. The redder
slopes, emitted power, and characteristic timescales of the fast flares can be
explained as optically-thin synchrotron emission from a compact jet arising on
size scales ~140-500 Gravitational radii (with a possible additional
contribution by a thermal particle distribution). The origin of the slower
variations is unclear. The optical continuum spectral slopes are strongly
affected by dereddening uncertainties and contamination by strong H{alpha}
emission, but the variations of these slopes follow relatively stable loci as a
function of flux. Cross-correlating the slow variations between the different
bands shows asymmetries on all nights consistent with a small red skew (i.e.,
red lag). X-ray reprocessing and non-thermal emission could both contribute to
these. These data reveal a complex mix of components over five decades in
timescale during the outburst.

to their exotic magnetism and possible application in quantum computing.
However, in all current materials out-of-plane interactions are interfering
with the in-plane order, hence a true 2D magnetic honeycomb system is still of
demand. Here, we report the exfoliation of the magnetic semiconductor
$\alpha$-RuCl$_3$ into the first halide monolayers and the magnetic
characterization of the spin $\frac{1}{2}$ honeycomb arrangement of
turbostratically stacked RuCl$_3$ monolayers. The exfoliation is based on a
reductive lithiation/hydration approach, which gives rise to a loss of
cooperative magnetism due to the disruption of the spin $\frac{1}{2}$ state by
electron injection into the layers. After an oxidative treatment, cooperative
magnetism similar to the bulk is restored. The oxidized pellets of restacked
single layers feature a magnetic transition at T$_N$ = 7 K in the in-plane
direction, while the magnetic properties in the out-of-plane direction vastly
differ from bulk $\alpha$-RuCl$_3$. The macroscopic pellets of RuCl$_3$
therefore behave like a stack of monolayers without any symmetry relation in
the stacking direction. The deliberate introduction of turbostratic disorder to
manipulate the spin structure of RuCl$_3$ is of interest for research in
frustrated magnetism and complex magnetic order as predicted by the
Kitaev-Heisenberg model.

the presence of an excess in the diphoton spectrum that would correspond to a
resonance of a 750 GeV mass. The apparently large production cross section is
nevertheless very difficult to explain in minimal models. We consider the
possibility that the resonance is a pseudoscalar boson $A$ with a two--photon
decay mediated by a charged and uncolored fermion having a mass at the $\frac12
M_A$ threshold and a very small decay width, $\ll 1$ MeV; one can then generate
a large enhancement of the $A\gamma\gamma$ amplitude which explains the excess
without invoking a large multiplicity of particles propagating in the loop,
large electric charges and/or very strong Yukawa couplings. The implications of
such a threshold enhancement are discussed in two explicit scenarios: i) the
Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model in which the $A$ state is produced via
the top quark mediated gluon fusion process and decays into photons
predominantly through loops of charginos with masses close to $\frac12 M_A$ and
ii) a two Higgs doublet model in which $A$ is again produced by gluon fusion
but decays into photons through loops of vector--like charged heavy leptons. We
also comment on a minimal scenario in which the $A$ state couples only to
photons through a heavy lepton loop and is both produced and decays through
this coupling. In all these scenarios, while the mass of the charged fermion
has to be adjusted to be extremely close to half of the $A$ resonance mass, the
small total widths are naturally obtained if only suppressed three-body decay
channels occur. Finally, the implications of some of these scenarios for dark
matter are discussed.

crowds in order to identify high quality content. Yet the sequential voting
mechanisms that are commonly used by these systems are at odds with existing
theoretical and empirical literature on optimal aggregation. This literature
suggests that sequential voting will promote herding---the tendency for
individuals to copy the decisions of others around them---and hence lead to
suboptimal content recommendation. Is there a problem with our practice, or a
problem with our theory? Previous attempts at answering this question have been
limited by a lack of objective measurements of content quality. Quality is
typically defined endogenously as the popularity of content in absence of
social influence. The flaw of this metric is its presupposition that the
preferences of the crowd are aligned with underlying quality. Domains in which
content quality can be defined exogenously and measured objectively are thus
needed in order to better assess the design choices of social recommendation
systems. In this work, we look to the domain of education, where content
quality can be measured via how well students are able to learn from the
material presented to them. Through a behavioral experiment involving a
simulated massive open online course (MOOC) run on Amazon Mechanical Turk, we
show that sequential voting systems can surface better content than systems
that elicit independent votes.

the model of two extremally charged black holes in static equilibrium (a
Majumdar--Papapetrou solution). Our perspective is that binary spacetimes are
natural exemplars of chaotic scattering, because they admit more than one
fundamental null orbit, and thus an uncountably-infinite set of perpetual null
orbits which generate scattering singularities in initial data. Inspired by the
three-disc model, we develop an appropriate symbolic dynamics to describe
planar null geodesics on the double black hole spacetime. We show that a
one-dimensional (1D) black hole shadow may constructed through an iterative
procedure akin to the construction of the Cantor set; thus the 1D shadow is
self-similar. Next, we study non-planar rays, to understand how angular
momentum affects the existence and properties of the fundamental null orbits.
Taking slices through 2D shadows, we observe three types of 1D shadow: regular,
Cantor-like, and highly chaotic. The switch from Cantor-like to regular occurs
where outer fundamental orbits are forbidden by angular momentum. The highly
chaotic part is associated with an unexpected feature: stable and bounded null
orbits, which exist around two black holes of equal mass $M$ separated by $a_1
< a < \sqrt{2} a_1$, where $a_1 = 4M/\sqrt{27}$. To show how this possibility
arises, we define a certain potential function and classify its stationary
points. We conjecture that the highly chaotic parts of the 2D shadow possess
the Wada property. Finally, we consider the possibility of following null
geodesics through event horizons, and chaos in the maximally-extended
spacetime.

reported by both ATLAS and CMS experiments at LHC. While the simplest
interpretation requires the resonant production of a 750 GeV (pseudo)scalar,
here we consider an alternative setup, with an additional heavy parent particle
which decays into a pair of 750 GeV resonances. This configuration improves the
agreement between the 8 TeV and 13 TeV data. Moreover, we include a dark matter
candidate in the form of a Majorana fermion which interacts through the 750 GeV

decay channels into Standard Model particles in association with the diphoton
signal. We realise our hierarchical framework in the context of an effective
theory, and we analyse the diphoton signal as well as the consistency with
other LHC searches. We finally address the interplay of the LHC results with
the dark matter phenomenology, namely the compatibility with the relic density
abundance and the indirect detection bounds.

users can express their opinions about products, such as movies, books, songs,
etc. Such interactions can be modeled as bipartite graphs where the weight of
the directed edge from a user to a product denotes a rating that the user
imparts to the product. These graphs are used for recommendation systems and
discovering most reliable (trusted) products. For these applications, it is
important to capture the bias of a user when she is rating a product. Users
have inherent bias---many users always impart high ratings while many others
always rate poorly. It is necessary to know the bias of a reviewer while
reading the review of a product. It is equally important to compensate for this
bias while assigning a ranking for an object. In this paper, we propose an
algorithm to capture the bias of a user and then subdue it to compute the true
rating a product deserves. Experiments show the efficiency and effectiveness of
our system in capturing the bias of users and then computing the true ratings
of a product.

spacetimes. For many applications of holography, one has to handle the
divergences associated with the on-shell gravitational action. The brute force
approach uses the Fefferman-Graham (FG) expansion near the AdS boundary to
identify the divergences, but subsequent reversal of the expansion is needed to
construct the infinite counterterms. While in principle straightforward, the
method is cumbersome and application/reversal of FG is formally unsatisfactory.
Various authors have proposed an alternative method based on the
Hamilton-Jacobi equation. However, this approach may appear to be abstract,
difficult to implement, and in some cases limited in applicability. In this
paper, we clarify the Hamilton-Jacobi formulation of holographic
renormalization and present a simple algorithm for its implementation to
extract cleanly the infinite counterterms. While the derivation of the method
relies on the Hamiltonian formulation of general relativity, the actual
application of our algorithm does not. The work applies to any $D$-dimensional
holographic dual with asymptotic AdS boundary, Euclidean or Lorentzian, and
arbitrary slicing. We illustrate the method in several examples, including the
FGPW model, a holographic model of 3d ABJM theory, and cases with marginal
scalars such as a dilaton-axion system.

Gong and Robinson [36], is known to support stationary and travelling bumps of
localised activity. We pose the model on a ring and study the existence and
stability of these patterns in various limits using a combination of analytical
and numerical techniques. In a purely deterministic version of the model, posed
on a continuum, we construct bumps and travelling waves analytically using
standard interface methods from neural fields theory. In a stochastic version
with Heaviside firing rate, we construct approximate analytical probability
mass functions associated with bumps and travelling waves. In the full
stochastic model posed on a discrete lattice, where a coarse analytic
description is unavailable, we compute patterns and their linear stability
using equation-free methods. The lifting procedure used in the coarse
time-stepper is informed by the analysis in the deterministic and stochastic
limits. In all settings, we identify the synaptic profile as a mesoscopic
variable, and the width of the corresponding activity set as a macroscopic
variable. Stationary and travelling bumps have similar meso- and macroscopic
profiles, but different microscopic structure, hence we propose lifting
operators which use microscopic motifs to disambiguate between them. We provide
numerical evidence that waves are supported by a combination of high synaptic
gain and long refractory times, while meandering bumps are elicited by short
refractory times.

Solar radio bursts are an important diagnostic tool in the understanding of
FEBs as well as the solar plasma environment in which they are propagating
along solar magnetic fields. In particular, the evolutions of the energy
spectrum and velocity distribution of FEBs due to the interaction with the
ambient plasma and field when propagating can significantly influence the
efficiency and property of their emissions. In this paper, we discuss some
possible evolutions of the energy spectrum and velocity distribution of FEBs
due to the energy loss processes and the pitch-angle effect caused by the
magnetic field inhomogeneity, and analyze the effects of these evolutions on
electron cyclotron maser (ECM) emission, which is one of the most important
mechanisms of producing solar radio bursts by FEBs. The results show that the
growth rates all decrease with the energy loss factor $Q$, but increase with
the magnetic mirror ratio $\sigma$ as well as with the steepness index
$\delta$. Moreover, the evolution of FEBs also can significantly influence the
fastest growing mode and the fastest growing phase angle. This leads to the
change of the polarization sense of ECM emission. In particular, our results
also reveal that FEB that undergoes different evolution processes will generate
different types of ECM emission. We believe the present results to be very
helpful on more comprehensive understanding of dynamic spectra of solar radio
bursts.

that arises in several engineering applications. Consistent and accurate
propagation of uncertainties is important to ensuring good estimation

mixture filters and particle filters were introduced to handle non-Gaussianity
and nonlinearity. However, these methods have seen only limited success as most
mixture filters attempt to fix the number of mixture modes during estimation
process, and the particle filters suffer from the curse of dimensionality. In
this paper, we propose a particle based Gaussian mixture filtering approach for
the general nonlinear estimation problem that is free of the particle depletion
problem inherent to most particle filters. We employ an ensemble of randomly
sampled states for the propagation of state probability density. A Gaussian
mixture model of the propagated uncertainty is then recovered by clustering the
ensemble. The posterior density is obtained subsequently through a Kalman
measurement update of the mixture modes. We prove the weak convergence of the
PGM density to the true filter density assuming exponential forgetting of
initial conditions by the true filter. The estimation performance of the

management, there has been resistance to using these tools in the actual
practice of managing ecological populations. Given a managed system and a set
of assumptions, translated into a model, optimization methods can be used to
solve for the most cost effective management actions. However, when the
underlying assumptions are not met, such methods can potentially lead to poor
decisions. Managers who develop decisions based on past experience and
judgment, without the aid of mathematical models, can potentially learn about
the system and develop flexible management strategies. However, these
strategies are often based on subjective criteria and equally invalid and often
unstated assumptions. Given the drawbacks of both methods, it is unclear
whether simple quantitative models improve environmental decision making over
expert opinion. In this paper, we explore how well students, using their
experience and judgment, manage simulated fishery populations in an online
computer game and compare their management outcomes to the performance of
model-based decisions. We consider harvest decisions generated using four
different quantitative models: 1. the model used to produce the simulated
population dynamics observed in the game, with all underlying parameter values
known [a control], 2. the same model, but with unknown parameter values that
must be estimated during the game from observed data, 3. models that are
structurally different from those used to simulate the population dynamics and
4. a model that ignores age structure. Humans on average performed much worse
than the models in cases 1 - 3. When the models ignored age structure, they
generated poorly performing management decisions, but still outperformed
students using experience and judgment 66 percent of the time.

interest in several applications. This problem is challenging primarily because
rigid body motion is described by nonlinear dynamics and the state space is
nonlinear. The extended Kalman filter and its several variants have remained
the standard and most commonly used schemes for attitude estimation over the
last several decades. These schemes are obtained as approximate solutions to
the nonlinear optimal filtering problem. However, these approximate or near
optimal solutions may not give stable estimation schemes in general. The
variational attitude estimator was introduced recently to fill this gap in
stable estimation of arbitrary rigid body attitude motion in the presence of
uncertainties in initial state and unknown measurement noise. This estimator is
obtained by applying the Lagrange-d'Alembert principle of variational mechanics
to a Lagrangian constructed from residuals between measurements and state
estimates with a dissipation term that is linear in the angular velocity
measurement residual. In this work, the variational attitude estimator is
generalized to include angular velocity measurements that have a constant bias
in addition to measurement noise. The state estimates converge to true states
almost globally over the state space. Further, the bias estimates converge to
the true bias once the state estimates converge to the true states.

recommendation accuracy. Intuitively, a user tends to trust different subsets
of her social friends, regarding with different scenarios. Therefore, the main
challenge of social recommendation is to exploit the optimal social dependency
between users for a specific recommendation task. In this paper, we propose a
novel recommendation method, named probabilistic relational matrix
factorization (PRMF), which aims to learn the optimal social dependency between
users to improve the recommendation accuracy, with or without users' social
relationships. Specifically, in PRMF, the latent features of users are assumed
to follow a matrix variate normal (MVN) distribution. The positive and negative
dependency between users are modeled by the row precision matrix of the MVN
distribution. Moreover, we have also proposed an efficient alternating
algorithm to solve the optimization problem of PRMF. The experimental results
on real datasets demonstrate that the proposed PRMF method outperforms
state-of-the-art social recommendation approaches, in terms of root mean square
error (RMSE) and mean absolute error (MAE).

Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) CO(2-1) observations of circumnuclear gas

detecting gas within the gravitational sphere of influence of the central black
holes. In NGC 1332, the 0.3""-resolution ALMA data reveal CO emission from the
highly inclined (i~ 83 degrees) circumnuclear disk, spatially coincident with
the dust disk seen in Hubble Space Telescope images. The disk exhibits a
central upturn in maximum line-of-sight velocity reaching +-500 km/s relative
to the systemic velocity, consistent with the expected signature of rapid
rotation around a supermassive black hole. Rotational broadening and beam
smearing produce complex and asymmetric line profiles near the disk center. We
constructed dynamical models for the rotating disk and fitted the modeled CO
line profiles directly to the ALMA data cube. Degeneracy between rotation and
turbulent velocity dispersion in the inner disk precludes the derivation of
strong constraints on the black hole mass, but model fits allowing for a
plausible range in the magnitude of the turbulent dispersion imply a central
mass in the range ~(4-8)x10^8 Msun. We argue that gas-kinematic observations
resolving the black hole's projected radius of influence along the disk's minor
axis will have the capability to yield black hole mass measurements that are
largely insensitive to systematic uncertainties in turbulence or in the stellar
mass profile. For highly inclined disks, this is a much more stringent
requirement than the usual sphere-of-influence criterion.

MIDA learns a subspace which has maximum independence with the domain features,

augmentation strategy is also designed to project samples according to their
backgrounds so as to improve the adaptation. The proposed algorithms are
flexible and fast. Their effectiveness is verified by experiments on synthetic

They can greatly enhance the practicability of sensor systems, as well as
extend the application scope of existing domain adaptation algorithms by

for specific rare objects in a massive spectral dataset, given a small fraction
of identified samples with the same type. Most existing methods are mainly
based on binary classification, which usually suffer from uncompleteness when
the known samples are too few. While, rank-based methods would provide good
solutions for such case. After investigating several algorithms, a method
combining bipartite ranking model with bootstrap aggregating techniques was
developed in this paper. The method was applied in searching for carbon stars
in the spectral data of Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) DR10, and compared with
several other popular methods used in data mining. Experimental results
validate that the proposed method is not only the most effective but also less
time consuming among these competitors automatically searching for rare spectra

performing a certain number of jobs. The expected payoff from a match depends

our framework applies more broadly to platforms where a limited supply of

  Our main contribution is a complete characterization of the structure of the
optimal policy in the limit that each worker performs many jobs. The platform
faces a trade-off for each worker between myopically maximizing payoffs

a multitude of multi-armed bandit problems, one for each worker, coupled
together by the constraint on availability of jobs of different types (capacity
constraints). We find that the platform should estimate a shadow price for each

Our results show that this multi-peak (symmetric or asymmetric) mode could be
regarded as a single pulse formed by a nonlinear superposition of a periodic
wave and a single-peak (W-shaped or antidark) soliton. In particular, a phase
diagram for different types of nonlinear excitations on a continuous wave
background including breather, rogue wave, W-shaped soliton, antidark soliton,
periodic wave, and multi-peak soliton is established based on the explicit link
between exact nonlinear wave solution and modulation instability analysis.
Numerical simulations are performed to confirm the propagation stability of the
multi-peak solitons with symmetric and asymmetric structures. Further, we
unveil a remarkable shape-changing feature of asymmetric multi-peak solitons.
It is interesting that these shape-changing interactions occur not only in the
intraspecific collision (soliton mutual collision) but also in the
interspecific interaction (soliton-breather interaction). Our results
demonstrate that each multi-peak soliton exhibits the coexistence of shape
change and conservation of the localized energy of light pulse against the

speed and expansion of the CME in the inner heliosphere as well as its
interaction with a preceding slow CME. The estimation of the speed of the CME

through a rapid acceleration as well as expansion up to a height of $\approx$6

kms$^{-1}$ between the Sun and 1 AU. These results show that the CME likely
overcame the drag exerted by the ambient/background solar-wind with the support
of its internal magnetic energy. When the CME interacted with a slow preceding

ever-smaller masses. Naively one might expect this process to continue down to
the smallest mass that is able to radiate away its binding energy on a
dynamical timescale, the opacity limit for fragmentation, at $\sim 0.01$
$M_\odot$. However, the observed peak of the initial mass function (IMF) lies a
factor of $20-30$ higher in mass, suggesting that some other mechanism halts
fragmentation before the opacity limit is reached. In this paper we analyse
radiation-magnetohydrodynamic simulations of star cluster formation in typical
Milky Way environments in order to determine what physical process limits
fragmentation in them. We examine the regions in the vicinity of stars that
form in the simulations to determine the amounts of mass that are prevented
from fragmenting by thermal and magnetic pressure. We show that, on small
scales, thermal pressure enhanced by stellar radiation heating is the dominant
mechanism limiting the ability of the gas to further fragment. In the brown
dwarf mass regime, $\sim 0.01$ $M_\odot$, the typical object that forms in the
simulations is surrounded by gas whose mass is several times its own that is
unable to escape or fragment, and instead is likely to accrete. This mechanism
explains why $\sim 0.01$ $M_\odot$ objects are rare: unless an outside agent
intervenes (e.g., a shock strips away the gas around them), they will grow by
accreting the warmed gas around them. In contrast, by the time stars grow to
masses of $\sim 0.2$ $M_\odot$, the mass of heated gas is only tens of percent
of the central star mass, too small to alter its final mass by a large factor.
This naturally explains why the IMF peak is at $\sim 0.2$ $M_\odot$.

and a low-mass M dwarf from the observation of the microlensing event
OGLE-2014-BLG-0257. Resolution of the very short-lasting caustic crossing
combined with the detection of subtle continuous deviation in the lensing light
curve induced by the Earth's orbital motion enable us to precisely measure both
the Einstein radius \theta_E and the lens parallax pi_E, which are the two
quantities needed to unambiguously determine the mass and distance to the lens.
It is found that the companion is a substellar brown dwarf with a mass 0.036
+/- 0.005 Msun (37.7 +/- 5.2\ M_J) and it is orbiting an M dwarf with a mass
0.19 +/- 0.02 Msun. The binary is located at a distance 1.25 +/- 0.13 kpc
toward the Galactic bulge and the projected separation between the binary
components is 0.61 +/- 0.07 AU. The separation scaled by the mass of the host
is 3.2 AU/Msun. Under the assumption that separations scale with masses, then,
the discovered brown dwarf is located in the zone of the brown dwarf desert.
With the increasing sample of brown dwarfs existing in various environments,
microlensing will provide a powerful probe of brown dwarfs in the Galaxy.

This paper is a fallout of the previous work by authors on Boolean
satisfiability \cite{sul1, sul2,sude}, however the algorithm is essentially
independent of the orthogonal expansion concept over which previous papers were
based. The algorithm selects a single concrete cofactor recursively by
projecting the search space to the set which satisfies a CNF in the formula.
This cofactor is called \emph{projective cofactor}. The advantage of such a
computation is that it recursively decomposes the satisfiability problem into
independent sub-problems at every selection of a projective cofactor. This
leads to a parallel algorithm for deciding satisfiability and computing all

question of how network data can be modeled in a way that reflects known
empirical behaviors and respects basic statistical principles. We address this
question by observing that edges, not vertices, act as the statistical units in
networks constructed from interaction data, making a theory of edge-labeled
networks more natural for many applications. In this context we introduce the
concept of {\em edge exchangeability}, which unlike its vertex exchangeable
counterpart admits models for networks with sparse and/or power law structure.
Our characterization of edge exchangeable networks gives rise to a class of
nonparametric models, akin to graphon models in the vertex exchangeable
setting. Within this class, we identify a tractable family of distributions
with a clear interpretation and suitable theoretical properties, whose
significance in estimation, prediction, and testing we demonstrate.

multiresolution analysis for the chosen seismic data and related data noise

  Typical seismic data used for history matching, such as acoustic impedance,
are inverted quantities, whereas extra uncertainties may arise during the
inversion processes. In the proposed framework we avoid such intermediate
inversion processes. In addition, we also adopt wavelet-based sparse
representation to reduce data size. Concretely, we use intercept and gradient
attributes derived from amplitude versus angle (AVA) data, apply multilevel
discrete wavelet transforms (DWT) to attribute data, and estimate noise level
of resulting wavelet coefficients. We then select the wavelet coefficients
above a certain threshold value, and history-match these leading wavelet
coefficients using an iterative ensemble smoother.

spherical standing sound wave, whose antinodes concentrated dust into rotating

  Towards this goal, we present a novel methodology called semi-supervised

ask the instructor to identify or add a correct submission in each cluster. We
then verify every submission in a cluster against the instructor-validated
submission in the same cluster. If faults are detected in the submission then
feedback suggesting fixes to them is generated. Clustering reduces the burden
on the instructor and also the variations that have to be handled during
feedback generation. The verified feedback generation ensures that only correct

designed a novel counter-example guided feedback generation algorithm capable

mean free path for collisions with static defects and phonons becomes greater
than the sample width. Under this condition, the electron transport occurs by
formation of a viscous flow of an electron fluid. We study the viscous flow of
2D electrons in a magnetic field perpendicular to the 2D layer. We calculate
the viscosity coefficients as the functions of magnetic field and temperature.
The off-diagonal viscosity coefficient determines the dispersion of the 2D
hydrodynamic waves. The decrease of the diagonal viscosity in magnetic field
leads to negative magnetoresistance which is temperature- and size dependent.
Our analysis demonstrates that the viscous mechanism is responsible for the
giant negative magnetoresistance recently observed in the ultra-high-mobility

supervised setting, using an image-as-matrix representation. A common procedure
is to project image matrices into a smaller space in which the recognition is
performed. These methods are often called ""two-dimensional"" in the literature
and there exist counterparts that use an image-as-vector representation. When
two face images are close to each other in the input space they may remain
close after projection - but this is not desirable in the situation when these
two images are from different classes, and this often affects the recognition
performance. We extend a previously developed `repulsion Laplacean' technique
based on adding terms to the objective function with the goal or creation a
repulsion energy between such images in the projected space. This scheme, which
relies on a repulsion graph, is generic and can be incorporated into various
two-dimensional methods. It can be regarded as a multilinear generalization of
the repulsion strategy by Kokiopoulou and Saad [Pattern Recog., 42 (2009), pp.
2392--2402]. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed methodology
offers significant recognition improvement relative to the underlying
two-dimensional methods.

light of multiple wavelengths in the same direction and it was further applied
to the design of planar lenses without chromatic aberrations [Science, 347,
1342(2015)]. However, such metasurface can only work for normal incidence and
exhibit low conversion efficiency. Here, we present an ultrawide-angle and
high-efficiency metasurface without chromatic aberration for wavefront shaping
in visible range. The metasurface is constructed by multiple metallic
nano-groove gratings, which support enhanced diffractions for an ultrawide
incident angle range from 10o to 80o due to the excitations of localized gap
plasmon modes at different resonance wavelengths. Incident light at these
resonance wavelengths can be efficiently diffracted into the same direction
with complete suppression of the specular reflection. This approach is applied
to the design of an achromatic flat lens for focusing light of different
wavelengths into the same position. Our findings provide a facile way to design
various achromatic flat optical elements for imaging and display applications.

recent promising technique is Product Quantization, which attempts to index

Cartesian product of low dimensional subspaces and quantizing each of them
separately. Despite the promising results reported, their quantization approach
follows the typical hard assignment of traditional quantization methods, which
may result in large quantization errors and thus inferior search performance.
Unlike the existing approaches, in this paper, we propose a novel approach
called Sparse Product Quantization (SPQ) to encoding the high-dimensional

representations of the feature vectors by minimizing their quantization errors,
making the resulting representation is essentially close to the original data

at wider orbits are rare. The Ursa Major (UMa) group, a young stellar
association at an age of about 200-600 Myr and an average distance of 25 pc,
has not yet been addressed as a whole although its members represent a very
interesting sample to search for and characterize sub-stellar companions by
direct imaging. Our goal was to find or to provide detection limits on wide
sub-stellar companions around nearby UMa group members using high-resolution
imaging. We searched for faint companions around 20 UMa group members within 30
pc. The primaries were placed below a semi-transparent coronagraph, a rather
rarely used mode of NACO, to increase the dynamic range of the images. In most
cases, second epoch images of companion candidates were taken to check whether
they share common proper motion with the primary. Our coronagraphic images rule
out sub-stellar companions around the stars of the sample. A dynamical range of
typically 13-15 mag in the Ks band was achieved at separations beyond 3"" from
the star. Candidates as faint as Ks ~ 20 were securely identified and measured.
The survey is most sensitive between separations of 100 and 200 au but only on
average because of the very different target distance. Field coverage reaches
about 650 au for the most distant targets. Most of the 200 candidates are
visible in two epochs. All of those were rejected being distant background
objects.

$\eta_{s}$ are comparable to or larger than the mean values. In such a

With increase in frequency of driving, the distribution becomes multipeaked. At

theoretical studies circa two decades ago but its evidence remains
controversial. Here, we present direct evidence for the observation of CCB in a
six-quantum-dot array (QDA) under high magnetic fields at 20 mK. The coherent
inter-dot coupling is enhanced and mediated via the Quantum Hall edge states of
the GaAs sample substrate. Two continuously fine-tuned gate voltages enable the
quantum dot conductance spectrum to undergo a localization to delocalization
transition process which manifests as an emergence and a collapse of CCB. The
transition between these two distinct quantum phases is analogous to the
Mott-Hubbard metal-insulator transition. The gate-voltage-dependent conductance
map thus obtained makes it possible to utilize QDA as an on-chip laboratory for

DBMS scalability. A partitioning, however, may introduce extra query processing
latency unless it is sensitive to a specific query workload, and optimised to
minimise inter-partition traversals for that workload. Additionally, it should
also be possible to incrementally adjust the partitioning in reaction to
changes in the graph topology, the query workload, or both. Because of their
complexity, current partitioning algorithms fall short of one or both of these
requirements, as they are designed for offline use and as one-off operations.
The TAPER system aims to address both requirements, whilst leveraging existing
partitioning algorithms. TAPER takes any given initial partitioning as a
starting point, and iteratively adjusts it by swapping chosen vertices across
partitions, heuristically reducing the probability of inter-partition
traversals for a given pattern matching queries workload. Iterations are
inexpensive thanks to time and space optimisations in the underlying support
data structures. We evaluate TAPER on two different large test graphs and over
realistic query workloads. Our results indicate that, given a hash-based
partitioning, TAPER reduces the number of inter-partition traversals by around
80%; given an unweighted METIS partitioning, by around 30%. These reductions
are achieved within 8 iterations and with the additional advantage of being
workload-aware and usable online.

techniques allow the construction of systems which are samples driven, which
means they only dissipate dynamic energy when there processing data and idle
otherwise. This inherent advantage of asynchronous design over conventional
synchronous circuits allows them to be energy efficient. However the
implementation flow of asynchronous systems is still difficult due to its lack
of compatibility with industry-standard synchronous design tools and modelling
languages. This paper devises a novel asynchronous design for a finite impulse
response (FIR) filter, an essential building block of DSP systems, which is
synthesizable and suitable for implementation using conventional synchronous
systems design flow and tools. The proposed design is based on a modified
version of the micropipline architecture and it is constructed using four phase

atomistic scale, purely by consideration of the macroscopic inputs and outputs.
Whenever the uncertainty of this prediction is greater than a predetermined
acceptable threshold, a new MD simulation is performed to continually augment
the database, which is never required to be complete. This provides a
substantial enhancement to the current generation of hybrid methods, which
often require many similar atomistic simulations to be performed, discarding
information after it is used once.
  We apply our hybrid scheme to nano-confined unsteady flow through a
high-aspect-ratio converging-diverging channel, and make comparisons between
the new scheme and full MD simulations for a range of uncertainty thresholds
and initial databases. For low thresholds, our hybrid solution is highly
accurate\,---\,within the thermal noise of a full MD simulation. As the
uncertainty threshold is raised, the accuracy of our scheme decreases and the
computational speed-up increases (relative to a full MD simulation), enabling
the compromise between precision and efficiency to be tuned. The speed-up of
our hybrid solution ranges from an order of magnitude, with no initial
database, to cases where an extensive initial database ensures no new MD
simulations are required.

equation with two times-scales. The fast time-scale is strongly dissipative and
drives the system towards a low-dimensional decoherence-free space. To perform
the adiabatic elimination of this fast relaxation, we propose a geometric
asymptotic expansion based on the small positive parameter describing the
time-scale separation. This expansion exploits geometric singular perturbation
theory and center-manifold techniques. We conjecture that, at any order, it
provides an effective slow Lindblad master equation and a completely positive
parameterization of the slow invariant sub-manifold associated to the
low-dimensional decoherence-free space. By preserving complete positivity and
trace, two important structural properties attached to open quantum dynamics,
we obtain a reduced-order model that directly conveys a physical interpretation
since it relies on effective Lindbladian descriptions of the slow evolution. At
the first order, we derive simple formulae for the effective Lindblad master
equation. For a specific type of fast dissipation, we show how any Hamiltonian
perturbation yields Lindbladian second-order corrections to the first-order
slow evolution governed by the Zeno-Hamiltonian. These results are illustrated
on a composite system made of a strongly dissipative harmonic oscillator, the
ancilla, weakly coupled to another quantum system.

phylogenetic network. To compute such a network in the form of a level-1

turbulence from a purely toroidal magnetic field in an accretion disk is
presented. It is already known that in a differentially rotating system, the
uniform toroidal magnetic field is unstable due to a magnetorotational
instability (MRI) under a non-axisymmetric and vertical perturbation, while it
is stable under a purely vertical perturbation. Contrary to the previous study,
this paper proposes an unstable mode completely confined to the equatorial
plane, driven by the expansive nature of the magnetic pressure gradient force
under a non-uniform toroidal field. The basic nature of this growing eigenmode,
to which we give a name ""magneto-gradient driven instability"", is studied using
linear analysis, and the corresponding nonlinear evolution is then investigated
using two-dimensional ideal MHD simulations. Although a single localized
magnetic field channel alone cannot provide sufficient Maxwell stress to
contribute significantly to the angular momentum transport, we find that the
mode coupling between neighboring toroidal fields under multiple localized
magnetic field channels drastically generates a highly turbulent state and
leads to the enhanced transport of angular momentum, comparable to the
efficiency seen in previous studies on MRIs. This horizontally confined mode
may play an important role in the saturation of an MRI through complementray
growth with the toroidal MHDs and coupling with magnetic reconnection.

natural scenario to explain these Zeeman-only spectro-polarimetric observations

them being close to 90 degrees. The component that lies lower in the atmosphere
is permeated by a strong field of the order of 600 G, while the upper component

polarization signatures of the individual components have opposite signs, so
that its combination along the line of sight reduces --and even can cancel

heavy nuclei affect seriously their half-lives against the decay. Purpose: We
investigate the description of the different decay stages in both the optimum
orientation and the orientation-averaged pictures of the cluster decay process.
Method: We consider the decays of 232,233,234U and 236,238Pu isotopes. The
quantum mechanical knocking frequency and penetration probability based on the
Wentzel-Kramers-Brillouin approximation are used to find the decay width.
Results: We found that the orientation-averaged decay width is one or two
orders of magnitude less than its value along the non-compact optimum
orientation. The difference between the two values increases with decreasing
the mass number of the emitted cluster. Correspondingly, the extracted
preformation probability based on the averaged decay width increases with the
same orders of magnitude compared to its value obtained considering the optimum
orientation. The cluster preformation probabilities (Sc) obtained in the two
considered schemes give more or less comparable agreement with the
Blendowske-Walliser (BW) formula based on the preformation probability of
Sa(ave.) obtained from the orientation-averaging scheme. All the obtained
results, including those obtained in the optimum-orientation scheme, deviate
substantially from the BW law based on Sa(opt.) obtained using the
optimum-orientation scheme. Conclusion: In order to account for deformations of
the participating nuclei, it is more relevant to calculate the decay width by
averaging over the different possible orientations of the participating
deformed nucleus, rather than considering the corresponding non-compact optimum
orientation.

of the $\alpha$ relaxation time extracted from an overlap function related to

the framework of the Random First Order Transition (RFOT) theory of the glass

results and show that our data for the $\alpha$ relaxation time for all

find that the fragility parameter obtained from fits of the temperature
dependence of the $\alpha$ relaxation time to the Vogel-Fulcher-Tammann (VFT)

increased from zero. Our scaling description relates the fragility parameter to
the static length scale of RFOT and thus provides a physical understanding of
fragility within the framework of the RFOT theory. Implications of these
findings for the values of the exponents appearing in the RFOT theory are
discussed.

This chapter details the current state of our observational knowledge of
streams in galaxies in and beyond the Local Group, which are studied both in
resolved stellar populations and in integrated light. Modeling of individual
streams in extragalactic systems is hampered by our inability to obtain
resolved stellar kinematics in the streams, though many streams contain
alternate luminous kinematic tracers, such as globular clusters or planetary
nebulae. We compare the observed structures to the predictions of models of
galactic halo formation, which provide insight in the number and properties of
streams expected around Milky Way like galaxies. More specifically, we discuss
the inferences that can be made about stream progenitors based only on observed
morphologies. We expand our discussion to consider hierarchical accretion at
lower mass scales, in particular the observational evidence that substructure
exists on smaller mass scales and the effects accretion events may have on the
evolution of dwarf galaxies (satellite or isolated). Lastly, we discuss
potential correlations between the presence of substructure in the halo and the
structural properties of the disk. While many exciting discoveries have been
made of tidal substructures around external galaxies, the ""global"" questions of
galaxy formation and evolution via hierarchical accretion await a more complete
census of the low surface brightness outskirts of galaxies in and beyond the

traffic can be offloaded via D2D links, if a helper user are willing to send

In this paper, we strive to find the minimal energy consumption required at a
helper user to maximize the amount of offloaded traffic. To this end, we
introduce a user-centric proactive caching policy that can control the energy
cost for a helper user to convey a file, and then optimize the caching policy
to maximize the offloaded traffic. To reduce the energy during transmission, we
optimize the transmit power to minimize the energy consumed by a helper to send

with the optimized caching policy and transmit power by numerical and
simulation results, which demonstrate that a significant amount of traffic can
be offloaded with affordable energy costs.

the contribution from van der Waals interaction in the computation of

helical magnetic fields, the nature of the axionic condensate may change and
become dark energy. Such dark energy may affect galaxy formation and galactic
dynamics, so this possibility should not be ignored when considering axionic
dark matter.

propagating in one direction with two characteristic velocities of the same

filament network (the cosmic web), we still struggle to detect these filaments
at high redshifts. We perform a weak lensing study for a sample of 16 massive,
medium-high redshift (0.4<z<0.9) galaxy clusters from the DAFT/FADA survey,
that are imaged in at least three optical bands with Subaru/Suprime-Cam or
CFHT/MegaCam. We estimate the cluster masses using an NFW fit to the shear
profile measured in a KSB-like method, adding our contribution to the
calibration of the observable-mass relation required for cluster abundance
cosmological studies. We compute convergence maps and select structures within,
securing their detection with noise re-sampling techniques. Taking advantage of
the large field of view of our data, we study cluster environment, adding
information from galaxy density maps at the cluster redshift and from X-ray
images when available. We find that clusters show a large variety of weak
lensing maps at large scales and that they may all be embedded in filamentary
structures at megaparsec scale. We classify them in three categories according
to the smoothness of their weak lensing contours and to the amount of
substructures: relaxed (~7%), past mergers (~21.5%), recent or present mergers
(~71.5%). The fraction of clusters undergoing merging events observationally
supports the hierarchical scenario of cluster growth, and implies that massive
clusters are strongly evolving at the studied redshifts. Finally, we report the
detection of unusually elongated structures in CLJ0152, MACSJ0454, MACSJ0717,
A851, BMW1226, MACSJ1621, and MS1621.

extension of the weak lensing formalism capable of describing strongly lensed
images. By integrating the non-linear geodesic deviation equation, the
amplification matrix of weak lensing is generalised to a sum over independent
amplification tensors of increasing rank. We show how an image distorted by a
generic lens may be constructed as a sum over `roulettes', which are the
natural curves associated with the independent spin modes of the amplification
tensors. Highly distorted images can be constructed even for large sources
observed near or within the Einstein radius of a lens where the shear and
convergence are large. The amplitude of each roulette is formed from a sum over
appropriate derivatives of the lensing potential. Consequently, measuring these
individual roulettes for images around a lens gives a new way to reconstruct a
strong lens mass distribution without requiring a lens model. This formalism
generalises the convergence, shear and flexion of weak lensing to arbitrary
order, and provides a unified bridge between the strong and weak lensing
regimes.

the atomic population between two spin states. A small relative displacement of

resolve and address individual excitation lines. Together with sensitive
atom-counting, this constitutes a feasible technique to count single excited
atoms of a BEC and to determine the temperature of nearly pure condensates. As
an example, we show that for a nearly pure BEC of N = 800 atoms the first

a general manner. Using direct numerical simulations we show that the turbulent
fluctuations of the supersaturation field offer different conditions for the
growth of droplets which evolve in time due to turbulent transport and mixing.
Based on that, we propose a Lagrangian stochastic model for condensation and
evaporation of small droplets in turbulent flows. It consists of a set of
stochastic integro-differential equations for the joint evolution of the
squared radius and the supersaturation along the droplet trajectories. The
model has two parameters fixed by the total amount of water and the
thermodynamic properties, as well as the Lagrangian integral timescale of the
turbulent supersaturation. The model reproduces very well the droplet size
distributions obtained from direct numerical simulations and their time
evolution. A noticeable result is that, after a stage where the squared radius
simply diffuses, the system converges exponentially fast to a statistical
steady state independent of the initial conditions. The main mechanism involved
in this convergence is a loss of memory induced by a significant number of
droplets undergoing a complete evaporation before growing again. The
statistical steady state is characterised by an exponential tail in the droplet
mass distribution. These results reconcile those of earlier numerical studies,
once these various regimes are considered.

(outer shocks) and mergers (inner shocks). These processes additionally produce
turbulence. To analyse the relation between the thermal and turbulent energies
of the gas under the influence of non-adiabatic processes, we performed
numerical simulations of cosmic structure formation in a box of 152 Mpc
comoving size with radiative cooling, UV background, and a subgrid scale model
for numerically unresolved turbulence. By smoothing the gas velocities with an
adaptive Kalman filter, we are able to estimate bulk flows toward cluster
cores. This enables us to infer the velocity dispersion associated with the
turbulent fluctuation relative to the bulk flow. For halos with masses above
$10^{13}\,M_\odot$, we find that the turbulent velocity dispersions averaged
over the warm-hot intergalactic medium (WHIM) and the intracluster medium (ICM)
are approximately given by powers of the mean gas temperatures with exponents
around 0.5, corresponding to a roughly linear relation between turbulent and
thermal energies and transonic Mach numbers. However, turbulence is only weakly
correlated with the halo mass. Since the power-law relation is stiffer for the
WHIM, the turbulent Mach number tends to increase with the mean temperature of
the WHIM. This can be attributed to enhanced turbulence production relative to
dissipation in particularly hot and turbulent clusters.

GW 150914 can constrain possible deviations from the Kerr metric. In this
letter, we compare their constraints with those that can be obtained from
accreting black holes by fitting their reflected X-ray spectrum, the so-called
iron line method. We simulate observations with eXTP, a next generation X-ray
mission, finding constraints much stronger than those obtained by Konoplya &
Zhidenko. Our results can at least show that, contrary to what is quite
commonly believed, it is not obvious that gravitational waves are the most
powerful approach to test strong gravity. In the presence of high quality data
and with the systematics under control, the iron line method may provide
competitive constraints.

  hearing loss as a putative correlate of tinnitus-related neuronal
  hyperactivity",,,,,"q-bio.QM q-bio.NC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Subjective tinnitus (ST) is generally assumed to be a consequence of hearing
loss (HL). In animal studies acoustic trauma can lead to behavioral signs of
ST, in human studies ST patients without increased hearing thresholds were
found to suffer from so called hidden HL. Additionally, ST is correlated with
pathologically increased spontaneous firing rates and neuronal hyperactivity
(NH) along the auditory pathway. Homeostatic plasticity (HP) has been proposed
as a compensation mechanism leading to the development of NH, arguing that
after HL initially decreased mean firing rates of neurons are subsequently
restored by increased spontaneous rates. However all HP models fundamentally
lack explanatory power since the function of keeping mean firing rate constant
remains elusive as does the benefit this might have in terms of information
processing. Furthermore the neural circuitry being able to perform the
comparison of preferred with actual mean firing rate remains unclear. Here we
propose an entirely new interpretation of ST related development of NH in terms
of information theory. We suggest that stochastic resonance (SR) plays a key
role in short- and long-term plasticity within the auditory system and is the
ultimate cause of NH and ST. SR has been found ubiquitous in neuroscience and
refers to the phenomenon that sub-threshold, unperceivable signals can be
transmitted by adding noise to sensor input. We argue that after HL, SR serves
to lift signals above the increased hearing threshold, hence subsequently
decreasing thresholds again. The increased amount of internal noise is the
correlate of the NH, which finally leads to the development of ST, due to
neuronal plasticity along the auditory pathway. We demonstrate the plausibility
of our hypothesis by using a computational model and provide exemplarily
findings of human and animal studies that are consistent with our model.

classifying all possible one-loop such models we identify various processes
that render the neutral component of these representations (dark matter)
cosmologically unstable. Thus, our findings show that these scenarios are in
general not reconcilable with dark matter stability unless tiny couplings or
additional ad hoc symmetries are assumed, in contrast to minimal dark matter
models where stability is entirely due to the standard model gauge symmetry.
For some variants based on higher-order loops we find that $\alpha_2$ reaches a
Landau pole at rather low scales, a couple orders of magnitude from the
characteristic scale of the model itself. Thus, we argue that some of these
variations although consistent with dark matter stability and phenomenological
constraints are hard to reconcile with perturbativity criteria.

Here an $F$-decomposition of a graph $G$ is a collection of edge-disjoint

  The $F$-decomposition threshold $\delta_F$ is the smallest value ensuring
that an $F$-divisible graph $G$ on $n$ vertices with
$\delta(G)\ge(\delta_F+o(1))n$ has an $F$-decomposition. Our main results imply
the following for a given graph $F$, where $\delta_F^\ast$ is the fractional

applications such as MRI, CT, radio astronomy and geophysics. Our algorithm,
termed SParse Uniform ReSampling (SPURS), employs methods from modern sampling
theory to achieve a small approximation error while maintaining low
computational cost. The given non-Cartesian samples are projected onto a
selected intermediate subspace, spanned by integer translations of a compactly
supported kernel function. This produces a sparse system of equations
describing the relation between the nonuniformly spaced samples and a vector of
coefficients representing the projection of the signal onto the chosen
subspace. This sparse system of equations can be solved efficiently using
available sparse equation solvers. The result is then projected onto the
subspace in which the sampled signal is known to reside. The second projection
is implemented efficiently using a digital linear shift invariant (LSI) filter
and produces uniformly spaced values of the signal on a Cartesian grid. The
method can be iterated to improve the reconstruction results. We then apply
SPURS to reconstruction of MRI data from nonuniformly spaced k-space samples.
Simulations demonstrate that SPURS outperforms other reconstruction methods
while maintaining a similar computational complexity over a range of sampling
densities and trajectories as well as various input SNR levels.

  space representation","Doctoral Thesis, University of Oxford, 189 pages, 41 figures",,,,"physics.plasm-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Magnetic confinement fusion reactors suffer severely from heat and particle
losses through turbulent transport, which has inspired the construction of ever
larger and more expensive reactors. Numerical simulations are vital to their
design and operation, but particle collisions are too infrequent for fluid
descriptions to be valid. Instead, strongly magnetised fusion plasmas are
described by the gyrokinetic equations, a nonlinear integro-differential system
for evolving the particle distribution functions in a five-dimensional position
and velocity space, and the consequent electromagnetic field. Due to the high
dimensionality, simulations of small reactor sections require hundreds of
thousands of CPU hours on High Performance Computing platforms.
  We develop a Hankel-Hermite spectral representation for velocity space that
exploits structural features of the gyrokinetic system. The representation
exactly conserves discrete free energy in the absence of explicit dissipation,
while our Hermite hypercollision operator captures Landau damping with few
variables. Calculation of the electromagnetic fields becomes purely local,
eliminating inter-processor communication in, and vastly accelerating, searches
for linear instabilities. We implement these ideas in SpectroGK, an efficient
parallel code.
  Turbulent fusion plasmas may dissipate free energy through linear phase
mixing to fine scales in velocity space, as in Landau damping, or through a
nonlinear cascade to fine scales in physical space, as in hydrodynamic
turbulence. Using SpectroGK to study saturated electrostatic drift-kinetic
turbulence, we find that the nonlinear cascade suppresses linear phase mixing
at energetically-dominant scales, so the turbulence is fluid-like. We use this
observation to derive Fourier-Hermite spectra for the electrostatic potential
and distribution function, and confirm these spectra with simulations.

tight constraints on the explosion epoch. Our observational campaign began
approximately one day post-explosion, and extended over a period of about 150
days post maximum light, making it one of the best observed objects of this
class to date. We find a peak magnitude of M$_r$ = -17.27 $\pm$ 0.07, and a
($\Delta m_{15})_r$ = 0.69 $\pm$ 0.04. Comparing our observations to synthetic
spectra generated from simulations of deflagrations of Chandrasekhar mass
carbon-oxygen white dwarfs, we find reasonable agreement with models of weak
deflagrations that result in the ejection of ~0.2 M$_{\odot}$ of material
containing ~0.07 M$_{\odot}$ of 56Ni. The model light curve however, evolves
more rapidly than observations, suggesting that a higher ejecta mass is to be
favoured. Nevertheless, empirical modelling of the pseudo-bolometric light
curve suggests that $\lesssim$0.6 M_sun of material was ejected, implying that
the white dwarf is not completely disrupted, and that a bound remnant is a
likely outcome.

difference between ""angular"" and ""luminosity"" distances within the framework of
the expanding photosphere method (EPM) that relies upon a relation between flux
and angular size to yield a distance. Following a re-derivation of the basic
equations of the EPM for SNe at non-negligible redshifts, we conclude that the
EPM results in an angular distance. The observed flux should be converted into
the SN rest frame and the angular size, theta, has to be corrected by a factor
of (1+z)^2. Alternatively, the EPM angular distance can be converted to a
luminosity distance by implementing a modification of the angular size. For SN
2013eq, we find EPM luminosity distances of D_L = 151 +/- 18 Mpc and D_L = 164
+/- 20 Mpc by making use of different sets of dilution factors taken from the
literature. Application of the standardized candle method for Type II-P SNe
results in an independent luminosity distance estimate (D_L = 168 +/- 16 Mpc)

superconducting tunable devices able to operate with high Q-factors at power
levels equivalent to only a few photons. In this work, we developed a 3D
microwave reentrant cavity with such characteristics ready to provide a very
fine-tuning of a high-Q resonant mode over a large dynamic range. This system
has an electronic tuning mechanism based on a mechanically amplified
piezoelectric actuator, which controls the resonator dominant mode frequency by
changing the cavity narrow gap by very small displacements. Experiments were
conducted at room and dilution refrigerator temperatures showing a large
dynamic range up to 4 GHz and 1 GHz, respectively, and were compared to a FEM
model simulated data. At elevated microwave power input, nonlinear thermal
effects were observed to destroy the superconductivity of the cavity due to the
large electric fields generated in the small gap of the reentrant cavity.

solved for a half-integer spin free particle. The solution for the fundamental
state, corresponding to the reference frame in which the particle is at rest,
is compared with that obtained using the Dirac equation, especially as regards
the approximation in the relativistic limit, in which the speed of the particle
is close to that of light. Furthermore, the solutions that Majorana defines
unphysical, proving that their occupation probability increases with the
particle velocity, are taken into consideration. The anomalous behavior
exhibited by these states also shows that for high-energy particles with small

solutions for systems of differential equations commonly found in cosmological
perturbation theory. The method was set out, in a non-cosmological context, by
Feshchenko, Shkil' and Nikolenko (FSN) in 1966, and is applicable to cases
where perturbations are on sub-horizon scales. The FSN method is essentially an
extension of the well known Wentzel-Kramers-Brillouin (WKB) method for finding
approximate analytical solutions for ordinary differential equations. The FSN
method we use is applicable well beyond perturbation theory to solve systems of
ordinary differential equations, linear in the derivatives, that also depend on
a small parameter, which here we take to be related to the inverse wave-number.
  We use the FSN method to find new approximate oscillating solutions in linear
order cosmological perturbation theory for a flat radiation-matter universe.
Together with this model's well known growing and decaying M\'esz\'aros
solutions, these oscillating modes provide a complete set of sub-horizon
approximations for the metric potential, radiation and matter perturbations.
Comparison with numerical solutions of the perturbation equations shows that
our approximations can be made accurate to within a typical error of 1%, or
better. We also set out a heuristic method for error estimation. A Mathematica
notebook which implements the double power series method is made available
online.

the inverse of the geometric mean of the probabilities, as good inference
algorithms reduce the uncertainty and a qualitative reduction due to the
increased clarity between the original set of probabilistic forecasts and their
central tendency, the geometric mean. Further insight is provided by showing
that the R\'enyi and Tsallis entropy functions translated to the probability

generalized mean of probabilistic forecasts forms a spectrum of performance
