electronics. Thermal management of flexible electronics creates a demand for
flexible materials with highly anisotropic thermal conductivity, which work as
heat spreaders to remove excess heat in the in-plane direction and as heat
shields to protect human skin or device components under them from heating.
This study proposes a self-assembled silver nanowire network with high thermal
and electrical anisotropy with the potential to solve these challenges. The
in-plane thermal conductivity of the network along the axial direction of
silver nanowires is measured as 37 W/m-K while the cross-plane thermal
conductivity is only 0.36 W/m-K. The results of measurements of electrical and
thermal conductivities suggest that abundant wire-wire contacts strongly impede
thermal transport. The excellent alignment of nanowires results in the same
anisotropy ratio of 3 for both thermal and electrical conduction in the two
in-plane directions. The ratio remains unchanged as the temperature decrease to
50 K, which indicates that wire-wire contacts lower the thermal and electrical
conduction in the two directions to the same extent and their effect is
independent of temperature. In addition, phonon softening markedly reduces the
Debye temperatures of the network, which are fitted from the electrical
resistivity data. As a result of phonon thermal conduction, the Lorenz numbers
of the film in the two directions, which are approximately the same, are larger
than the Sommerfeld value at room temperature and decrease as temperature
decreases because of small angle scattering and the reduced phonon
contribution. This nanowire network provides a solution to the emerging
challenges of thermal management of flexible electronics.

generalize some of the popular metrics, such as the Jaccard and bag distances
on sets, Manhattan distance on vector spaces, and Marczewski-Steinhaus distance
on integrable functions. We prove that the new metrics are complete and show
useful relationships with $f$-divergences for probability distributions. To
further extend our approach to structured objects such as concept hierarchies
and ontologies, we introduce information-theoretic metrics on directed acyclic
graphs drawn according to a fixed probability distribution. We conduct
empirical investigation to demonstrate intuitive interpretation of the new
metrics and their effectiveness on real-valued, high-dimensional, and
structured data. Extensive comparative evaluation demonstrates that the new
metrics outperformed multiple similarity and dissimilarity functions
traditionally used in data mining, including the Minkowski family, the
fractional $L^p$ family, two $f$-divergences, cosine distance, and two
correlation coefficients. Finally, we argue that the new class of metrics is
particularly appropriate for rapid processing of high-dimensional and

of the Lyapunov exponents which we derived in a recent monograph. The new

through a simple limiting argument, to obtain criteria for the positivity and
simplicity of the Lyapunov exponents of such cocycles. Specializing to the

consequences on the continuity, positivity and simplicity of its Lyapunov

kernel perceptrons, have been conceived to counteract such difficulties. In
this paper, we investigate an enhanced perceptron model based on the notion of

comprises a subset of data instances belonging to one class that show high
coherence across a subset of features and high differentiation from nearest
instances of the other class under the same features (referred to as its
contrastive bicluster). Upon each local subspace associated with a pair of
contrastive biclusters a perceptron is trained and the model with highest area

reveal a spatially and spectrally resolved Br\gamma-line in emission with a
strong P Cygni profile, indicating outflowing matter with a terminal velocity
of ~500 km/s. Visibilities, differential phases, and closure phases are
detected in our observations within the spectral line and in the adjacent
continuum. Both total visibilities (continuum plus line emitting region) and
pure-line visibilities indicate that the Br\gamma-emitting region is more
compact (2-4 mas in diameter or ~6-13 au at 3.2 kpc) than the
continuum-emitting region (~5.4 mas or ~17 au). The absorption feature is also
spatially resolved at the longest baselines (81 and 85 m) and has a visibility
that is slightly smaller than the continuum-emitting region. The differential
phases at the four longest baselines display an \u2018S\u2019-shaped structure
across the line, peaking in the blue- and red-shifted high-velocity components.
The calibrated photocentre shifts are aligned with the known jet axis, i.e they
are probably tracing an ionised jet. The high-velocity components (v_r~100-500
km/s) are located far from the source, whereas the low-velocity components
(0-100 km/s) are observed to be closer, indicating a strong acceleration of the
gas flow in the inner 10 au. Finally, a non-zero closure phase along the
continuum is detected. By comparing our observations with the synthetic images
of the continuum around 2.16 um, we confirm that this feature originates from
the asymmetric brightness distribution of the continuum owing to the

introducing a new update rule which requires infrequent passes over the entire

conformal geometries, which provide models for, among others, the Euclidean,
spherical and hyperbolic geometries. On one hand, their relationship is usually
shown analytically, through a framework comparing the measurement of distances
and angles in Cayley-Klein geometries, including Lorentzian geometries, as done
by F. Bachmann and later R. Struve. On the other hand, such a relationship may
also be expressed in a purely linear algebraic manner, as explained by D.
Hestens, H. Li and A. Rockwood.
  The model described in this article unifies these approaches via a
generalization of Lie sphere geometry. Like the work of N. Wildberger, it is a
purely algebraic construction, and as such it works over any field of odd
characteristic. It is shown that measurement of distances and angles is an
inherent property of the model that is easy to identify, and the possible
models are classified over the real, complex and finite fields, and partially
in characteristic $2$, revealing a striking analogy between the real and finite

accord with previous studies, we find that a modest $B_\parallel$ applied
parallel to the native stripes aligns them perpendicular to it. However, upon
further increase of $B_\parallel$, stripes are reoriented back to their native
direction. Remarkably, applying $B_\parallel$ perpendicular to the native
stripes also aligns stripes parallel to it. Thus, regardless of the initial
orientation of stripes with respect to $B_\parallel$, stripes are ultimately
aligned \emph{parallel} to $B_\parallel$. These findings provide evidence for a
$B_\parallel$-induced symmetry breaking mechanism which challenge current
understanding of the role of $B_\parallel$ and should be taken into account

the charge and spin dynamics in low-dimensional electronic systems by means of
ultrashort and ultrabroadband electromagnetic pulses. A particular focus is put
on sub-cycle and single-cycle pulses and their utilization for coherent
control. The discussion is mostly limited to cases where the pulse duration is
shorter than the characteristic time scales associated with the involved
spectral features of the excitations. We work out that the pulse action amounts
in essence to a quantum map between the quantum states of the system at an
appropriately chosen time moment during the pulse. The influence of a
particular pulse shape on the post-pulse dynamics is reduced to several
integral parameters entering the expression for the quantum map. The validity
range of this reduction scheme for different strengths of the driving fields is
established and discussed for particular nanostructures. Acting with a periodic
pulse sequence, it is shown how the system can be steered to and largely
maintained in predefined states. The conditions for this nonequilibrium
sustainability are worked out by means of geometric phases, which are
identified as the appropriate quantities to indicate quasistationarity of
periodically driven quantum systems. Demonstrations are presented for the
control of the charge, spin, and valley degrees of freedom in nanostructures on
picosecond and subpicosecond time scales. The theory is illustrated with
several applications to one-dimensional semiconductor quantum wires and
superlattices, double quantum dots, semiconductor and graphene quantum rings.
Furthermore, we consider the response of strongly correlated systems to short
broadband pulses and show that this case bears a great potential to unveil high
order correlations while they build up upon excitations.

private data, where a data collector purchases private data from strategic data
subjects (individuals) through an incentive mechanism. The private data of each
individual represents her knowledge about an underlying state, which is the
information that the data collector desires to learn. Different from most of
the existing work on privacy-aware surveys, our model does not assume the data
collector to be trustworthy. Then, an individual takes full control of its own
data privacy and reports only a privacy-preserving version of her data.
  In this paper, the value of $\epsilon$ units of privacy is measured by the
minimum payment of all nonnegative payment mechanisms, under which an
individual's best response at a Nash equilibrium is to report the data with a
privacy level of $\epsilon$. The higher $\epsilon$ is, the less private the
reported data is. We derive lower and upper bounds on the value of privacy
which are asymptotically tight as the number of data subjects becomes large.
Specifically, the lower bound assures that it is impossible to use less amount
of payment to buy $\epsilon$ units of privacy, and the upper bound is given by
an achievable payment mechanism that we designed. Based on these fundamental
limits, we further derive lower and upper bounds on the minimum total payment
for the data collector to achieve a given learning accuracy target, and show
that the total payment of the designed mechanism is at most one individual's
payment away from the minimum.

and the mixed variational technique are combined for the fast eigenvalue
computations of arbitrarily complex phononic unit cells. This is done by
expanding the material properties in a Fourier expansion, as is the case with
PWE. The required matrix elements in the variational scheme are identified as
the discrete Fourier transform coefficients of material properties, thus
obviating the need for any explicit integration. The process allows us to
provide succinct and closed form expressions for all the matrices involved in
the mixed variational method. The scheme proposed here preserves both the
simplicity of expression which is inherent in the PWE method and the superior
convergence properties of the mixed variational scheme. We present numerical
results and comment upon the convergence and stability of the current method.
We show that the current representation renders the results of the method
stable over the entire range of the expansion terms as allowed by the spatial
discretization. When compared with a zero order numerical integration scheme,
the present method results in greater computational accuracy of all
eigenvalues. A higher order numerical integration scheme comes close to the
accuracy of the present method but only with significantly more computational
expense.

the bluer composite spectrum constructed from bright spectra than that from

accomplishes complex motor behaviors through the combination of a small number
of motor primitives. Many studies in the last couples of decades have
identified motor primitives at the kinematic, kinetic, and electromyographic
level, thus supporting modularity at different levels of organization in the
motor system. However, these studies relied on heterogeneous definitions of
motor primitives and on different algorithms for their identification. Standard
unsupervised learning algorithms such as principal component analysis,
independent component analysis, and non-negative matrix factorization, or more
advanced techniques involving the estimation of temporal delays of the relevant
mixture components have been applied. This plurality of algorithms has made
difficult to compare and interpret results obtained across different studies.
Moreover, how the different definitions of motor primitives relate to each
other has never been examined systematically. Here we propose a comprehensive
framework for the definition of different types of motor primitives and a
single algorithm for their identification. By embedding smoothness priors and
specific constraints in the underlying generative model, the algorithm can
identify many different types of motor primitives. We assessed the
identification performance of the algorithm both on simulated data sets, for
which the properties of the primitives and of the corresponding combination
parameters were known, and on experimental electromyographic and kinematic data
sets, collected from human subjects accomplishing goal-oriented and rhythmic
motor tasks. The identification accuracy of the new algorithm was typically
equal or better than the accuracy of other unsupervised learning algorithms
used previously for the identification of the same types of primitives.

indifference sets of the pairwise comparison probabilities. In addition to
measuring the usual worst-case risk of an estimator, this adaptivity index also
captures the extent to which the estimator adapts to instance-specific
difficulty relative to an oracle estimator. We prove three main results that
involve this adaptivity index and different algorithms. First, we propose a
three-step estimator termed Count-Randomize-Least squares (CRL), and show that
it has adaptivity index upper bounded as $\sqrt{n}$ up to logarithmic factors.
We then show that that conditional on the hardness of planted clique, no
computationally efficient estimator can achieve an adaptivity index smaller
than $\sqrt{n}$. Second, we show that a regularized least squares estimator can
achieve a poly-logarithmic adaptivity index, thereby demonstrating a
$\sqrt{n}$-gap between optimal and computationally achievable adaptivity.
Finally, we prove that the standard least squares estimator, which is known to
be optimally adaptive in several closely related problems, fails to adapt in

phonon dispersions computed within the first-principles density functional
theory in the generalized gradient approximation plus Hubbard $U$ correlation

the quasiharmonic approximation. Good agreement with the experiment is obtained
for calculations with an on-site Coulomb parameter $U = 4$ eV and Hund's
exchange $J= 0.6$ eV in line with previous electronic structure calculations.
We further compute the thermal expansion, heat capacity, thermal conductivity,

to phonons with energy higher than 25 meV ($\sim$ 6 THz ), suggesting an

occupation time $T_+$ of the one-dimensional random acceleration model on the

and also study the statistics of $T_+$ with Monte Carlo simulations. One goal
of our work was to ascertain whether the occupation time $T_+$ and the time
$T_m$ at which the maximum of the process is attained are statistically
equivalent. For regular Brownian motion the distributions of $T_+$ and $T_m$
coincide and are given by L\'evy's arcsine law. We show that for randomly
accelerated motion the distributions of $T_+$ and $T_m$ are quite similar but
not identical. This conclusion follows from the exact results for the moments
of the distributions and is also consistent with our Monte Carlo simulations.

mass-metallicity relations differ by an insignificant 1.6 sigma. For galaxies
in the stellar mass range 1.e10 to 1.e11 MSun, the increase in the star-forming

surprising 31-38% difference in the overall galaxy counts in F1 and F2 is
probably consistent with the expected cosmic variance given the subtleties of
the relative systematics in the two surveys. We also review the Deep Lens

precluded secure detection of the single massive cluster at z = 0.35 that we
find in SHELS. Taken together the two fields include 16,055 redshifts for

for sampling multiband analog signals below the Nyquist rate. MC sampling has
gained renewed interest in the Compressive Sensing (CS) community, due partly
to the fact that in the frequency domain, MC sampling bears a strong
resemblance to other sub-Nyquist CS acquisition protocols. In this paper, we
consider MC sampling of analog frequency hopping signals, which can be viewed
as multiband signals with changing band positions. This nonstationarity
motivates our consideration of a segment-based reconstruction framework, in
which the sample stream is broken into short segments for reconstruction. In
contrast, previous works focusing on the reconstruction of multiband signals
have used a segment-less reconstruction framework such as the modified MUSIC
algorithm. We outline the challenges associated with segment-based recovery of
frequency hopping signals from MC samples, and we explain how these challenges
can be addressed using conventional CS recovery techniques. We also demonstrate
the utility of the Discrete Prolate Spheroidal Sequences (DPSS's) as an

simple model of technology adoption. Firms are modelled as heterogeneous agents
with different behavioural responses. To quantify the gap, the model simulates
their investment decisions from different theoretical perspectives. While
relevant parameters are uncertain at the micro-level, using distributed agent
perspectives provides a realistic representation of the macro adoption rate.
The model is calibrated using audit data for proposed investments in energy

finite duration and aperiodic modulations make GRBs hard to characterise
temporally. Although correlations between GRB luminosity and spectral hardness
on one side and time variability on the other side have long been known, the
loose and often arbitrary definition of the latter makes the interpretation
uncertain. We characterise the temporal variability in an objective way and
search for a connection with rest-frame spectral properties for a number of
well-observed GRBs. We studied the individual power density spectra (PDS) of
123 long gamma-ray bursts with measured redshift, rest-frame peak energy Ep,i
of the time-averaged nuFnu spectrum, and well-constrained PDS slope alpha
detected with Swift, Fermi and past spacecraft. The PDS were modelled with a

synchrotron model, the Ep,i-alpha anti-correlation can hardly be reconciled

Alternatively, in the context of models based on magnetic reconnection, the PDS
slope and Ep,i are linked to the ejecta magnetisation at the dissipation site,

statistical properties, modelling the PDS of individual GRBs is challenging,
and only average PDS of large samples have been discussed in the literature. We
characterise the individual PDS of GRBs in terms of a stochastic process, and
carry out for the first time a systematic search for periodic signals and for a

Two classes of GRBs emerge: with or without a unique dominant timescale. A
comparison with active galactic nuclei (AGNs) reveals similar distributions of
PDS slopes. Unexpectedly, GRBs with subsecond-dominant timescales and duration
longer than a few tens of seconds in the source frame appear to be either very
rare or altogether absent. Three GRBs are found with possible evidence for a
periodic signal at ~3 sigma (Gaussian) significance, corresponding to a
multitrial chance probability of ~1%. Thus, we found no compelling evidence for
periodic signals. The analogy between the PDS of GRBs and of AGNs could
tentatively indicate similar stochastic processes that rule BH accretion across
different BH mass scales and objects. In addition, we find evidence that short
dominant timescales and duration are not completely independent of each other,

investigated, using different families of relativistic mean field
parametrizations with constant couplings and non-linear terms mixing the

of the density dependence of the symmetry energy, involving the $\sigma$ or the
$\omega$ meson, gives rise to different behaviors: the effect of the
$\omega$-meson may also be reproduced within non-relativistic phenomenological
models, while the effect of the $\sigma$-meson is essentially relativistic.
Depending on the parametrization with $\sigma-\rho$ or $\omega-\rho$ mixing
terms, different values of the slope of the symmetry energy at saturation must
be considered in order to obtain a neutron matter equation of state compatible
with results from chiral effective field theory. This difference leads to
different pressures at the crust-core transition density. A linear correlation
between the transition density and the symmetry energy slope or the neutron

flow"" in the quantum Hall effect (QHE) have been debated for years. Moreover,
the recent observation of proliferation of ""upstream"" neutral modes in the
fractional QHE raised doubts about the present models of edge channels. In this
article we focus on hole-conjugate states, nu=2/3 and nu=3/5, and present a new
picture of their edge reconstruction. For example, while the present model for
nu=2/3 consists of a single downstream charge channel with conductance 2/3
e^2/h and an upstream neutral mode, we show that the current is carried by two
separate downstream edge channels, each with conductance 1/3 e^2/h, accompanied
by upstream neutral mode(s). We find that if the two downstream channels are
not equilibrated, inter-mode equilibration (via particle exchange) takes place
over a distance of microns, with the two channels effectively behaving as a
single channel. Moreover, the inter-channel equilibration is accompanied by an
excitation of upstream neutral modes. In turn, the counter-propagating neutral
modes, moving in close proximity to the charge modes, fragment into propagating
charges, inducing thus downstream current fluctuations with zero net current -
a novel mechanism for non-equilibrium noise. This unexpected edge
reconstruction underlines the need for better understanding of edge
reconstruction and energy transport in all fractional QHE states.

modes is taken out of equilibrium, counter-propagating neutral modes born in

multiple-output (MIMO) broadcast channel with a general message set (BC-CM) -
that includes private and common messages - under fast fading. Nine different
channel state knowledge assumptions -collectively known as hybrid CSIT models -
are considered wherein the transmitter has either perfect/instantaneous (P),
delayed (D) or no (N) channel state information (CSI) from each of the two
receivers. General antenna configurations are addressed wherein the three
terminals have arbitrary numbers of antennas. The DoF regions are established
for the five hybrid CSIT models in which either both channels are unknown at
the transmitter or each of the two channels is known perfectly or with delay.
In the four remaining cases in which exactly one of the two channels is unknown
at the transmitter, the DoF regions under the restriction of linear encoding
strategies - also known as the linear DoF (LDoF) regions- are established. As
the key to the converse proofs of the LDoF region of the MIMO BC-CM under such
hybrid CSIT assumptions, we show that, when only considering linear encoding
strategies, the channel state information from the receiver with more antennas
does not help if there is no channel state information available from the
receiver with fewer antennas. This result is conjectured to be true even
without the restriction on the encoding strategies to be linear. If true, the
LDoF regions obtained for the four hybrid CSIT cases herein will also be the
DoF regions for those cases.

zero order resonances are the strongest ones; but for excited orbits higher
order 3BRs become also dynamically relevant. By means of numerical integrations
and the construction of dynamical maps we check some of the predictions of the
method. We numerically explore the possibility of a planetary system to be
trapped in a 3BR due to a migrating scenario. Our results suggest that capture
in a chain of two body resonances is more probable than a capture in a pure
3BR. When a system is locked in a 3BR and one of the planets is forced to
migrate the other two can react migrating in different directions. We exemplify
studying the case of the Galilean satellites where we show the relevance of the
different resonances acting on the three innermost satellites.

developing models for networks as well as studying the properties of such data.
Since individual network datasets continue to grow in size, it is necessary to
develop models that accurately represent the real-life scaling properties of
networks. One behavior of interest is having a power law in the degree
distribution. However, other types of power laws that have been observed
empirically and considered for applications such as clustering and feature
allocation models have not been studied as frequently in models for graph data.
In this paper, we enumerate desirable asymptotic behavior that may be of
interest for modeling graph data, including sparsity and several types of power
laws. We outline a general framework for graph generative models using
completely random measures; by contrast to the pioneering work of Caron and Fox
(2015), we consider instantiating more of the existing atoms of the random
measure as the dataset size increases rather than adding new atoms to the
measure. We see that these two models can be complementary; they respectively
yield interpretations as (1) time passing among existing members of a network
and (2) new individuals joining a network. We detail a particular instance of
this framework and show simulated results that suggest this model exhibits some
desirable asymptotic power-law behavior.

coalescing binary black hole (BBH) with masses of $\sim 30~M_\odot$. Previous
proposals for the origin of such a massive binary include Population III
(PopIII) stars. PopIII stars are efficient producers of BBHs and of a
gravitational wave background (GWB) in the $10-100$ Hz band, and also of
ionizing radiation in the early Universe. We quantify the relation between the
amplitude of the GWB ($\Omega_{\rm gw}$) and the electron scattering optical
depth ($\tau_{\rm e}$), produced by PopIII stars, assuming that $f_{\rm
esc}\approx 10\%$ of their ionizing radiation escapes into the intergalactic
medium. We find that PopIII stars would produce a GWB that is detectable by the
future O5 LIGO/Virgo if $\tau_{\rm e} \gtrsim 0.07$, consistent with the recent
Planck measurement of $\tau_e=0.055 \pm 0.09$. Moreover, the spectral index of

required to overcome the deficit in single-component models, but this requires
more fine-tuning and extreme parameters for the magnetar, as well as the
assumption of efficient conversion of magnetar energy into radiation. We thus
favor a single-input model where the reverse shock formed in a strong SN

technologies (e.g. 3G and 4G) or operators with non-overlapping bandwidths are
pooled and shared is expected to provide enhanced service with broader
coverage, without incurring additional infrastructure cost. However, their
emergence poses an unsolved question on how to harness such a technology and
bandwidth diversity. This paper addresses one of the simplest questions in this
class, namely, the issue of associating each mobile to one of those bandwidths.
Intriguingly, this association issue is intrinsically distinct from those in
traditional networks. We first propose a generic stochastic geometry model
lending itself to analyzing a wide class of association policies exploiting
various information on the network topology, e.g. received pilot powers and
fading values. This model firstly paves the way for tailoring and designing an
optimal association scheme to maximize any performance metric of interest (e.g.
the probability of coverage) subject to the information known about the
network. In this class of optimal association, we prove a result that the
performance improves as the information known about the network increases.
Secondly, this model is used to quantify the performance of any arbitrary
association policy and not just the optimal association policy. We propose a
simple policy called the Max-Ratio which is not-parametric, i.e. it dispenses
with the statistical knowledge of base station deployments in stochastic
geometry models. We also prove that this simple policy is optimal in a certain
limiting regime of the wireless environment. Through simulations, we provide
insights into (i) a practical compromise between performance gain and cost of
estimating information and; (ii) the selection of association schemes under
environments with different propagation models, i.e. path-loss exponents.

operator is studied in a class of non-equilibrium states. The latter are
represented by AdS-Vaidya geometries with an arbitrary parameter characterising
the timescale for the dual state to transit from an initial thermal equilibrium
to another due to a homogeneous quench. For long quench duration, the spectral
function indeed follows the thermal form at the instantaneous effective
temperature adiabatically, although with a slight initial time delay and a bit
premature thermalisation. At shorter quench durations, several new
non-adiabatic features appear: (i) time-dependence of the spectral function is
seen much before than that in the effective temperature (advanced
time-dependence), (ii) a big transfer of spectral weight to frequencies greater
than the initial temperature occurs at an intermediate time (kink formation)
and (iii) new peaks with decreasing amplitudes but in greater numbers appear
even after the effective temperature has stabilised (persistent oscillations).

quantitatively determine the impact of uncertainties $\delta R$ in the

show mild prograde rotation overall, with larger dispersions - in contrast to

points to remarkable similarities in their chemodynamical properties, which

redder than expected from thin accretion disk models. A possible resolution to
this conundrum is that many AGN are reddened by dust along the line of sight.
To explore this possibility, we stack 5000 SDSS AGN with luminosity
L~10^45erg/s and redshift z~0.4 in bins of optical continuum slope alpha_opt
and width of the broad H$\beta$ emission line. We measure the EW of the NaID
absorption feature in each stacked spectrum. We find a linear relation between
alpha_opt and EW(NaID), such that EW(NaID) increases as alpha_opt becomes
redder. In the bin with the smallest H$\beta$ width, objects with the bluest
slopes that are similar to accretion disk predictions are found to have
EW(NaID)=0, supporting the line-of-sight dust hypothesis. This conclusion is
also supported by the dependence of the $H\alpha/H\beta$ line ratio on
alpha_opt. The implied relationship between alpha_opt and dust reddening is
given by E(B-V)~0.2(-0.1-alpha_opt), and the implied reddening of a typical
type 1 AGN with alpha_opt=-0.5 is E(B-V)~0.08mag. Photoionization calculations
show that the dusty gas responsible for reddening is too ionized to produce the
observed features. Therefore, we argue that the sodium absorption arises in
regions of the host ISM which are shielded from the AGN radiation, and the
correlation with alpha_opt arises since ISM columns along shielded and
non-shielded sightlines are correlated. This scenario is supported by the
similarity of the E(B-V)-NaID relation implied by our results with the relation
in the Milky-Way found by previous studies.

of the next generation of UV space based instruments and so it should be
achieved in the next decade. The density field is populated with halos and
galaxies and their ${\rm Ly\alpha}$ emission is estimated. Galaxies are treated

X-ray and $\gamma$-ray sky as well as one of the nearest blazars to Earth, Mrk
421 is an excellent source for testing the scenario of the blazar-neutrino
connection. Here, we model the spectral energy distribution of Mrk 421 during a
13-day flare in 2010 with unprecedented multi-wavelength coverage, and
calculate the respective neutrino flux. We find a correlation between the $>1$
PeV neutrino and photon fluxes, in all energy bands. Using typical IceCube
through-going muon event samples with good angular resolution and high
statistics, we derive the mean event rate above 100 TeV ($\sim0.57$ evt/yr) and
show that it is comparable to that expected from a four-month quiescent period
in 2009. Due to the short duration of the flare, an accumulation of similar
flares over several years would be necessary to produce a meaningful signal for
IceCube. To better assess this, we apply the correlation between the neutrino
and $\gamma$-ray fluxes to the 6.9 yr Fermi-LAT light curve of Mrk 421. We find
that the mean event count above 1 PeV for the full IceCube detector livetime is
$3.59\pm0.60$ ($2.73\pm0.38$) $\nu_\mu+\bar{\nu}_\mu$ with (without) major
flares included in our analysis. This estimate exceeds, within the
uncertainties, the $95\%$ ($90\%$) threshold value for the detection of one or
more muon (anti-)neutrinos. Meanwhile, the most conservative scenario, where no
correlation of $\gamma$-rays and neutrinos is assumed, predicts $1.60\pm0.16$
$\nu_\mu+\bar{\nu}_\mu$ events. We conclude that a non-detection of high-energy
neutrinos by IceCube would probe the neutrino/$\gamma$-ray flux correlation
during major flares or/and the hadronic contribution to the blazar emission.

competition between 1D diffusion and RNA cleavage. Here we describe backtrack

possibility to guide a Gaussian beam through a 90{\deg} bend by photonic
crystal self-collimation phenomena. The method is digitally reconfigurable, is
completely scalable and could be extended to other kind of lattices as well.

from the point of view of ab-initio calculations. While the electron-phonon
interaction has been studied for almost a century, predictive non-empirical
calculations have become feasible only during the past two decades. Today it is
possible to calculate from first principles many materials properties related
to the electron-phonon interaction, including the critical temperature of
conventional superconductors, the carrier mobility in semiconductors, the
temperature dependence of optical spectra in direct and indirect-gap
semiconductors, the relaxation rates of photoexcited carriers, the electron
mass renormalization in angle-resolved photoelectron spectra, and the
non-adiabatic corrections to phonon dispersion relations. Here we review the
theoretical and computational framework underlying modern electron-phonon
calculations from first principles, as well as landmark investigations of the
electron-phonon interaction in real materials. In the first part of the article
we summarize the elementary theory of electron-phonon interactions and their
calculations based on density-functional theory. In the second part we discuss
a general field-theoretic formulation of the electron-phonon problem, and
establish the connection with practical first-principles calculations. In the
third part we review a number of recent investigations of electron-phonon
interactions in the areas of vibrational spectroscopy, photoelectron
spectroscopy, optical spectroscopy, transport, and superconductivity.

electron correlations in solids1. The insulating phase can often be suppressed
by quantum tuning, i.e. varying a nonthermal parameter such as chemical
composi- tion or pressure, resulting in a zero-temperature quantum phase
transition (QPT) to a metallic state driven by quantum fluctuations, in
contrast to conventional phase transitions driven by thermal fluctuations.
Theories of exotic phenomena known to occur near the Mott QPT such as quantum
criticality and high-temperature superconductivity often assume a second-order
QPT, but direct experimental evidence for either first- or second-order
behavior at the magnetic QPT associated with the Mott transition has been
scarce and further masked by the superconducting phase in unconventional
superconductors. Most measurements of QPTs have been performed by
volume-integrated probes, such as neutron scattering, magnetization, and
transport, in which discontinuous behavior, phase separation, and spatially
inhomogeneous responses are averaged and smeared out, leading at times to
misidentification as continuous second-order transitions. Here, we demonstrate
through muon spin relaxation/rotation (MuSR) experiments on two archetypal Mott
insulating systems, composition-tuned RENiO3 (RE=rare earth element) and
pressured-tuned V2O3, that the QPT from antiferromagnetic insulator to
paramagnetic metal is first-order: the magnetically ordered volume fraction
decreases to zero at the QPT, resulting in a broad region of intrinsic phase
separation, while the ordered magnetic moment retains its full value across the
phase diagram until it is suddenly destroyed at the QPT. These findings call
for further investigation into the role of inelastic soft modes and the nature
of dynamic spin and charge fluctuations underlying the transition.

centimeter radio up to very high energy (VHE; E$>$100 GeV). Its broadband
emission shows a periodicity of $\sim$26.5 days, coincident with the orbital
period. A longer (super-orbital) period of 1667 $\pm$ 8 days was discovered in
radio and confirmed in optical and high energy (HE; E>100 MeV) gamma-ray
observations. We present a four-year campaign performed by MAGIC together with
archival data concentrating on a search for a long timescale signature in the
VHE emission. We focus on the search for super-orbital modulation of the VHE
peak and on the search for correlations between TeV emission and optical
determination of the extension of the circumstellar disk. A four-year campaign
has been carried out by MAGIC. The source was observed during the orbital
phases when the periodic VHE outbursts have occurred ($\phi$=0.55-0.75).
Additionally, we included archival MAGIC observations and data published by the
VERITAS collaboration in these studies. For the correlation studies, LS I
+61$^{\circ}$303 has also been observed during the orbital phases where
sporadic VHE emission had been detected in the past ($\phi$=0.75-1.0). These
MAGIC observations were simultaneous with optical spectroscopy from the
LIVERPOOL telescope. The TeV flux of the periodical outburst in orbital phases
$\phi$=0.5--0.75 was found to show yearly variability consistent with the
$\sim$4.5 years long-term modulation found in the radio band. This modulation
of the TeV flux can be well described by a sine function with the best fit
period of $1610\pm 58$ days. The complete dataset span two super-orbital
periods. There is no evidence for a correlation between the TeV emission and
the mass-loss rate of the Be star but this may be affected by the strong, short
timescale (as short as intra-day) variation displayed by the H$\alpha$ fluxes.

containing twin nuclear star clusters, separated by a projected distance of 5
pc. One cluster (#5) coincides with the peak of the H-alpha emission and the
other (#11) with a massive ultracompact H II region. A recent analysis of these
clusters shows that they have a photometric age of 1+/-1 Myr, in apparent
contradiction with the age of 3-5 Myr inferred from the presence of Wolf-Rayet
features in the cluster #5 spectrum. We examine Hubble Space Telescope
ultraviolet and Very Large Telescope optical spectroscopy of #5 and show that
the stellar features arise from very massive stars (VMS), with masses greater
than 100 Msun, at an age of 1-2 Myr. We further show that the very high
ionizing flux from the nuclear clusters can only be explained if VMS are
present. We investigate the origin of the observed nitrogen enrichment in the
circum-cluster ionized gas and find that the excess N can be produced by
massive rotating stars within the first 1 Myr. We find similarities between the
NGC 5253 cluster spectrum and those of metal poor, high redshift galaxies. We
discuss the presence of VMS in young, star-forming galaxies at high redshift;
these should be detected in rest frame UV spectra to be obtained with the James
Webb Space Telescope. We emphasize that population synthesis models with upper
mass cut-offs greater than 100 Msun are crucial for future studies of young
massive star clusters at all redshifts.

relativistic plasma that interacts with the electromagnetic field. While it is
common to ignore the displacement current in the ideal, classical

approximation is less than absolutely well-justified. In such a situation, it
is more natural to consider a positively charged fluid made up of positrons or
protons interacting with a negatively charged fluid made up of electrons. The
two fluids interact collectively with the full set of Maxwell's equations. As a
result, a solution strategy for that coupled system of equations is sought and
found here. Our strategy extends to higher orders, providing increasing
accuracy. Three important innovations are reported here. In our first
innovation, the magnetic field within each zone is reconstructed in a
divergence-free fashion while the electric field within each zone is
reconstructed in a form that is consistent with Gauss' law. In our second
innovation, a multidimensionally upwinded strategy is presented which ensures
that the magnetic field can be updated via a discrete interpretation of
Faraday's law and the electric field can be updated via a discrete
interpretation of the generalized Ampere's law. Our third innovation consists
of an efficient design for several popular IMEX schemes so that they provide
strong coupling between the finite-volume-based fluid solver and the
electromagnetic fields at high order. Several accuracy analyses are presented
showing that our method meets its design accuracy in the MHD limit as well as
in the limit of electromagnetic wave propagation. Several stringent test
problems are also presented. We also present a relativistic version of the GEM
problem, which shows that our algorithm can successfully adapt to challenging
problems in high energy astrophysics.

jets, and three-jet events in which a J/\psi is produced in the gluon jet. In
the case of B mesons, we use a phenomenological FF extracted from e^+ e^-
collisions at the Z^0 pole evaluated at the scale \mu = m_b. For events with
J/\psi, the FF can be evaluated in terms of Non-Relativistic QCD (NRQCD) matrix
elements at the scale \mu =2 m_c. The z and \tau_a distributions from our NLL'
calculations are compared with predictions from monte carlo event generators.
While we find consistency between the predictions for B mesons and the J/\psi
distributions in \tau_a, we find the z distributions for J/\psi differ
significantly. We describe an attempt to merge PYTHIA showers with NRQCD FFs
that gives good agreement with NLL' calculations of the z distributions.

of the dark sector components present a scaling behaviour with
$\bar\varepsilon_{\mathrm{DM}} / \bar\varepsilon_{\mathrm{DE}} \sim \left({a_0}

perturbations of DM and DE, which are interacting among themselves, could be
coupled to the galaxies with the former being concentrated around them. To
carry our analysis, we consider the theory of scalar perturbations (within the
mechanical approach), and obtain the sets of parameters $(w,\gamma)$ which do
not contradict it. We conclude that two sets: $(w=-2/3,\gamma=1/3)$ and
$(w=-1,\gamma=1/3)$ are of special interest. First, the energy densities of DM
and DE on these cases are concentrated around galaxies confirming that they are
coupled fluids. Second, we show that for both of them, the coincidence problem
is less severe than in the standard $\Lambda$CDM. Third, the set
$(w=-1,\gamma=1/3)$ is within the observational constraints. Finally, we also
obtain an expression for the gravitational potential in the considered model.

the estimated time lag of (110\pm27) days between gamma-ray and radio light

de-projected distance of 1.2\pm0.9 pc from the jet apex. Flux variations at
X-ray bands were found to have a significant correlation with variations at
both radio and \gamma-rays energies. The correlation between X-rays and
gamma-rays light curves suggests presence of two components responsible for the
X-ray emission. A negative time lag of -(50\pm20) days, where the X-rays are

falls short of classification accuracy and efficiency. Traditional approaches
typically involve extracting discriminative features from the original time
series using dynamic time warping (DTW) or shapelet transformation, based on
which an off-the-shelf classifier can be applied. These methods are ad-hoc and
separate the feature extraction part with the classification part, which limits
their accuracy performance. Plus, most existing methods fail to take into
account the fact that time series often have features at different time scales.
To address these problems, we propose a novel end-to-end neural network model,
Multi-Scale Convolutional Neural Networks (MCNN), which incorporates feature
extraction and classification in a single framework. Leveraging a novel
multi-branch layer and learnable convolutional layers, MCNN automatically
extracts features at different scales and frequencies, leading to superior
feature representation. MCNN is also computationally efficient, as it naturally
leverages GPU computing. We conduct comprehensive empirical evaluation with

MCNN advances the state-of-the-art by achieving superior accuracy performance

matter field variables remain finite. In generic spacetimes, the latter
provides a finite, universal upper bound for the pointwise norm of the Higgs

  We also show that, in the presence of Friedman--Robertson--Walker or
Kantowski--Sachs symmetries, the energy density can have finite local minimum
only if the transitivity hypersurfaces of the spacetime symmetries are locally
hyperboloidal and their mean curvature is less than a finite critical value. In
particular, in the very early era of an expanding universe or in a nearly
spherically symmetric black hole near the central singularity, the Higgs sector
does not have any instantaneous vacuum state, and hence its rest mass is not
defined, and, via the Brout--Englert--Higgs (BEH) mechanism, the gauge and
spinor fields do not get non-zero rest mass. For smaller mean curvature
instantaneous symmetry breaking vacuum states of the Higgs sector emerge,
yielding non-zero rest mass and electric charge for some of the gauge and
spinor fields via the BEH mechanism. These rest masses are decreasing with
decreasing mean curvature, but the charge remains constant. It is also shown
that globally defined instantaneous vacuum states that are invariant with
respect to the spacetime symmetries do not exist at all in the $k=1,0$

$D^{(\ast)}K$ thresholds, we perform a similar analysis within a
nonrelativistic constituent quark model in which quark-antiquark and
meson-meson degrees of freedom are incorporated. The quark model has been
applied to a wide range of hadronic observables and thus the model parameters
are completely constrained. The coupling between quark-antiquark and
meson-meson Fock components is done using a $^{3}P_{0}$ model in which its only
free parameter $\gamma$ has been elucidated performing a global fit to the
decay widths of mesons that belong to different quark sectors, from light to
heavy. We observe that the coupling of the $0^{+}$ $(1^{+})$ meson sector to
the $DK$ $(D^{\ast}K)$ threshold is the key feature to simultaneously lower the
masses of the corresponding $D_{s0}^{\ast}(2317)$ and $D_{s1}(2460)$ states
predicted by the naive quark model and describe the $D_{s1}(2536)$ meson as the
$1^{+}$ state of the $j_{q}^{P}=3/2^{+}$ doublet predicted by heavy quark
symmetry, reproducing its strong decay properties. Our calculation allows to
introduce the coupling with the $D$-wave $D^{\ast}K$ channel and the
computation of the probabilities associated with the different Fock components
of the physical state.

nanotubes or molecular junctions, whose transport properties are modulated by
soft internal degrees of freedom, for example slow vibrational modes. In this
review, effects of the electron-vibration coupling on the charge and heat
transport of soft nanoscopic systems are theoretically investigated in the
presence of time-dependent perturbations, such as a forcing antenna or pumping
terms between the leads and the nanosystem. A well established approach valid
for non-equilibrium adiabatic regimes is generalized to the case where external
time-dependent perturbations are present. Then, a number of relevant
applications of the method are reviewed for systems composed by a quantum dot
(or molecule) described by a single electronic level coupled to a vibrational
mode. Before introducing time-dependent perturbations, the range of validity of
the adiabatic approach is discussed showing that a very good agreement with the
results of an exact quantum calculation is obtained in the limit of low level
occupation. Aim of this review has been to discuss common features of different
soft nanosystems under external drive. The most interesting effects induced by
time-dependent perturbations are obtained when the external forcing is nearly
resonant with the slow vibrational modes. Indeed, not only the external forcing
can enhance the electronic response, but it also induces nonlinear regimes
where the interplay between electronic and vibrational degrees of freedom plays
a major role.

functions, we apply sliding window and exponential decay. In terms of the
richness of content, we compare recommendations using both full-texts and

twelve recommendation strategies. We have conducted an online experiment with

recommendations are achieved by the strategy combining CF-IDF, sliding window,

seen at low inclination (< 40$^\circ$), or the black hole mass is less than 100
M$_\odot$, unless the orbital period is longer than 6 years, in which case the
obtained limit is not constraining. The spectrum of the counterpart to
J120922+295559 shows emission lines on top of its stellar spectrum, and the
remaining three counterparts do not show absorption lines that can be
associated with the atmosphere of a star; their spectra are instead dominated
by emission lines. Those counterparts with RSG spectra may be used in the

determine dynamical constraints on the mass of the accretor.

Reddit as an example, we study the evolution of users based on comment and

differences between users---yearly cohorts---we find wide differences in
people's behavior, including comment activity, effort, and survival. Further,
not accounting for time can lead us to misinterpret important phenomena. For
instance, we observe that average comment length decreases over any fixed
period of time, but comment length in each cohort of users steadily increases
during the same period after an abrupt initial drop, an example of Simpson's
Paradox. Dividing cohorts into sub-cohorts based on the survival time in the
community provides further insights; in particular, longer-lived users start at
a higher activity level and make more and shorter comments than those who leave
earlier. These findings both give more insight into user evolution in Reddit in
particular, and raise a number of interesting questions around studying online
behavior going forward.

image. While some multi-task vision problems can be decomposed into separate
tasks and stages, e.g., training independent models for each task, for a
growing set of problems joint optimization across all tasks has been shown to
improve performance. We show that for deep convolutional neural network (DCNN)
facial attribute extraction, multi-task optimization is better. Unfortunately,
it can be difficult to apply joint optimization to DCNNs when training data is
imbalanced, and re-balancing multi-label data directly is structurally
infeasible, since adding/removing data to balance one label will change the
sampling of the other labels. This paper addresses the multi-label imbalance
problem by introducing a novel mixed objective optimization network (MOON) with
a loss function that mixes multiple task objectives with domain adaptive
re-weighting of propagated loss. Experiments demonstrate that not only does
MOON advance the state of the art in facial attribute recognition, but it also
outperforms independently trained DCNNs using the same data. When using facial
attributes for the LFW face recognition task, we show that our balanced (domain
adapted) network outperforms the unbalanced trained network.

incorporation of doping atoms in the hexagonal networks. The local perturbation
caused by the doping atoms extends over both shells due to a hybridization of
their electronic states, yielding a reduction of the backscattering efficiency

cell networks (SCNs) is studied using mean field games (MFGs). In the
considered SCN, small base stations (SBSs) are equipped with data storage units
and cooperate to serve users' requests either from files cached in the storage
or directly from the capacity-limited backhaul. The aim of the SBSs is to
define a caching policy that reduces the load on the capacity-limited backhaul
links. This cache control problem is formulated as a stochastic differential
game (SDG). In this game, each SBS takes into consideration the storage state
of the other SBSs to decide on the fraction of content it should cache. To
solve this problem, the formulated SDG is reduced to an MFG by considering an
ultra-dense network of SBSs in which the existence and uniqueness of the
mean-field equilibrium is shown to be guaranteed. Simulation results show that
this framework allows an efficient use of the available storage space at the
SBSs while properly tracking the files' popularity. The results also show that,
compared to a baseline model in which SBSs are not aware of the instantaneous
system state, the proposed framework increases the number of served files from
the SBSs by more than 69%.

structure of the deuteron and using it to enable accurate studies of neutron
structure motivate us to examine the four-dimensional space-time nature of the
nuclear wave function, and the various approximations used to reduce it to an
object that depends only on three spatial variables.
  Purpose: The aim is to determine if the ability to understand and analyze
measured experimental cross sections is compromised by making the reduction
from four to three dimensions.
  Method: Simple, exactly-calculable, covariant models of a bound-state wave
state wave function (a scalar boson made of two constituent-scalar bosons) with
parameters chosen to represent a deuteron are used to investigate the accuracy
of using different approximations to the nuclear wave function to compute the
quasi-elastic scattering cross section. Four different versions of the wave
function are defined (light-front spectator, light-front, light-front with
scaling and non-relativistic) and used to compute the cross sections as a
function of how far off the mass-shell (how virtual) is the struck constituent.
  Results: We show that making an exact calculation of the quasi-elastic
scattering cross section involves using the light-front spectator wave
function. All of the other approaches fail to reproduce the model exact
calculation if the value of Bjorken $x$ differs from unity. The model is
extended to consider an essential effect of spin to show that constituent
nucleons cannot be treated as being on their mass shell even when taking the
matrix element of a `good' current.
  Conclusions: It is necessary to develop realistic light-front spectator wave
functions to meet the needs of current and planned experiments.

(i.e., young) [alpha/Fe]-rich red giant stars using high-resolution high-S/N
spectra from ESPaDOnS fed by Gemini-GRACES. Our differential analysis ensures
that our chemical abundances are on the same scale as the Alves-Brito et al.
(2010) study of bulge, thin and thick disk red giants. We confirm that the
program stars have enhanced [alpha/Fe] ratios and are slightly metal poor.
Aside from lithium enrichment in one object, the program stars exhibit no
chemical abundance anomalies when compared to giant stars of similar
metallicity throughout the Galaxy. This includes the elements Li, O, Si, Ca,
Ti, Cr, Ni, Cu, Ba, La, and Eu. Therefore, there are no obvious chemical
signatures that can help to reveal the origin of these unusual stars. While our
new observations show that only one star (not the Li-rich object) exhibits a
radial velocity variation, simulations indicate that we cannot exclude the
possibility that all four could be binaries. In addition, we find that two
(possibly three) stars show evidence for an infrared excess, indicative of a
debris disk. This is consistent with these young [alpha/Fe]-rich stars being
evolved blue stragglers, suggesting their apparent young age is a consequence
of a merger or mass transfer. We would expect a binary fraction of ~50% or
greater for the entire sample of these stars, but the signs of the circumbinary
disk may have been lost since these features can have short timescales. Radial
velocity monitoring is needed to confirm the blue straggler origin.

natural definition of compactification. This is based on almost c--projective
geometry, which is the almost complex analogue of projective differential
geometry. The boundary at infinity is a (possibly non-integrable) CR structure.
The theory applies to almost Hermitean manifolds which admit a complex metric
connection of minimal torsion, which means that they are quasi--Kaehler in the
sense of Gray--Hervella; in particular it applies to Kaehler and nearly Kaehler
manifolds. Via this canonical connection, we obtain a notion of c-projective
compactification for quasi--Kaehler metrics of any signature.
  We describe an asymptotic form for metrics that is necessary and sufficient
for c--projective compactness. This metric form provides local examples and, in
particular, shows that the usual complete Kaehler metrics associated to
smoothly bounded, strictly pseudoconvex domains in C^n are c--projectively
compact. For a smooth manifold with boundary and a complete quasi-Kaehler
metric $g$ on the interior, we show that if its almost c--projective structure
extends smoothly to the boundary then so does its scalar curvature. We prove
that $g$ is almost c--projectively compact if and only if this scalar curvature
is non-zero on an open dense set of the boundary, in which case it is, along
the boundary, locally constant and hence nowhere zero there. Finally we
describe the asymptotics of the curvature, showing, in particular, that the
canonical connection satisfies an asymptotic Einstein condition. Key to much of
the development is a certain real tractor calculus for almost c--projective
geometry, and this is developed in the article.

AD8302 microchip: a gain and phase detector from Analog Devices, Inc. To
construct the device, we have implemented a schematic that utilizes the
homodyne principle for signal processing instead of the traditional
superheterodyne approach. This design allows one to measure phase shifts with
high precision and linearity over the entire range of $0-360^\circ$. The system
is simple in construction and usage; it makes ultrasound measurements easily
accessible to a broad range of researchers. It was tested by measuring the
temperature dependence of the ultrasound speed and attenuation in a
KTa$_{0.92}$Nb$_{0.08}$O$_{3}$ (KTN) single crystal at a frequency of $\sim$ 40
MHz. The tests were performed in the vicinity of the ferroelectric transitions
where the large variations of the speed and attenuation demand a detector with
outstanding characteristics. The described detector has a wide dynamic range
and allows for measuring in a single run over the whole temperature range of
the ferroelectric transitions, rather than just in limited intervals available
previously. Moreover, due to the wide dynamic range of the gain measurements
and high sensitivity this instrument was able to reveal previously unresolvable
features associated with the development of the ferroelectric transitions of
KTN crystals.

  Factors and Forecasting Bond Risk Premia",,,,,"stat.ME econ.EM","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We study factor models augmented by observed covariates that have explanatory
powers on the unknown factors. In financial factor models, the unknown factors
can be reasonably well explained by a few observable proxies, such as the
Fama-French factors. In diffusion index forecasts, identified factors are
strongly related to several directly measurable economic variables such as
consumption-wealth variable, financial ratios, and term spread. With those
covariates, both the factors and loadings are identifiable up to a rotation
matrix even only with a finite dimension. To incorporate the explanatory power
of these covariates, we propose a smoothed principal component analysis (PCA):
(i) regress the data onto the observed covariates, and (ii) take the principal
components of the fitted data to estimate the loadings and factors. This allows
us to accurately estimate the percentage of both explained and unexplained
components in factors and thus to assess the explanatory power of covariates.
We show that both the estimated factors and loadings can be estimated with
improved rates of convergence compared to the benchmark method. The degree of
improvement depends on the strength of the signals, representing the
explanatory power of the covariates on the factors. The proposed estimator is
robust to possibly heavy-tailed distributions. We apply the model to forecast
US bond risk premia, and find that the observed macroeconomic characteristics
contain strong explanatory powers of the factors. The gain of forecast is more
substantial when the characteristics are incorporated to estimate the common
factors than directly used for forecasts.

interactions on the topological properties of the system. We particularly focus
on the vicinity of the topological phase transition, marked by the crossing of
two Landau levels, where the system is a strongly interacting quantum Hall
ferromagnet. We analyse the edge properties using the formalism of the
nonlinear $\sigma$-model. We establish the symmetry requirement for the
topological protection in this interacting system: effective continuous U(1)
symmetry with respect to uniaxial isospin rotations must be preserved. If U(1)
symmetry is preserved, the topologically nontrivial phase persists; its edge is
a helical Luttinger liquid with highly tunable effective interactions. We
obtain explicit analytical expressions for the parameters of the Luttinger
liquid. However, U(1) symmetry may be broken, either spontaneously or by
U(1)-asymmetric interactions. In either case, interaction-induced transitions

can be reduced because the cluster content cache provides a part of required
content objects for remote radio heads (RRHs) connected to a common edge cloud.
Tractable expressions for both effective capacity and energy efficiency
performance are derived, which show that the proposed structure can improve QoS
guarantees with a lower power cost of local storage. Furthermore, to fully
explore the potential of the proposed cluster content caching structure, the
joint design of resource allocation and RRH association is optimized, and two
distributed algorithms are accordingly proposed. Simulation results verify the
accuracy of the analytical results and show the performance gains achieved by
cluster content caching in C-RANs.

attribute recognition in real surveillance scenarios. Recognition of human
attributes, such as gender, and clothes types, has great prospects in real

attribute recognition remains lagged behind. Existing human attribute datasets
are collected from various sources or an integration of pedestrian
re-identification datasets. Such heterogeneous collection poses a big challenge
on developing high quality fine-grained attribute recognition algorithms.
Furthermore, human attribute recognition are generally severely affected by
environmental or contextual factors, such as viewpoints, occlusions and body
parts, while existing attribute datasets barely care about them. To tackle
these problems, we build a Richly Annotated Pedestrian (RAP) dataset from real
multi-camera surveillance scenarios with long term collection, where data
samples are annotated with not only fine-grained human attributes but also
environmental and contextual factors. RAP has in total 41,585 pedestrian
samples, each of which is annotated with 72 attributes as well as viewpoints,
occlusions, body parts information. To our knowledge, the RAP dataset is the
largest pedestrian attribute dataset, which is expected to greatly promote the
study of large-scale attribute recognition systems. Furthermore, we empirically
analyze the effects of different environmental and contextual factors on
pedestrian attribute recognition. Experimental results demonstrate that
viewpoints, occlusions and body parts information could assist attribute
recognition a lot in real applications.

most attractive channel codes. To date, the successive cancellation list (SCL)
decoding algorithm is the primary approach that can guarantee outstanding
error-correcting performance of polar codes. However, the hardware designs of
the original SCL decoder have large silicon area and long decoding latency.
Although some recent efforts can reduce either the area or latency of SCL
decoders, these two metrics still cannot be optimized at the same time. This
paper, for the first time, proposes a general log-likelihood-ratio (LLR)-based
SCL decoding algorithm with multi-bit decision. This new algorithm, referred as
LLR-2Kb-SCL, can determine 2K bits simultaneously for arbitrary K with the use
of LLR messages. In addition, a reduced-data-width scheme is presented to
reduce the critical path of the sorting block. Then, based on the proposed
algorithm, a VLSI architecture of the new SCL decoder is developed. Synthesis
results show that for an example (1024, 512) polar code with list size 4, the
proposed LLR-2Kb-SCL decoders achieve significant reduction in both area and
latency as compared to prior works. As a result, the hardware efficiency of the
proposed designs with K=2 and 3 are 2.33 times and 3.32 times of that of the
state-of-the-art works, respectively.

scenario, we propose the Graph Long Short-Term Memory (Graph LSTM) network,
which is the generalization of LSTM from sequential data or multi-dimensional
data to general graph-structured data. Particularly, instead of evenly and
fixedly dividing an image to pixels or patches in existing multi-dimensional
LSTM structures (e.g., Row, Grid and Diagonal LSTMs), we take each
arbitrary-shaped superpixel as a semantically consistent node, and adaptively
construct an undirected graph for each image, where the spatial relations of
the superpixels are naturally used as edges. Constructed on such an adaptive
graph topology, the Graph LSTM is more naturally aligned with the visual
patterns in the image (e.g., object boundaries or appearance similarities) and
provides a more economical information propagation route. Furthermore, for each
optimization step over Graph LSTM, we propose to use a confidence-driven scheme
to update the hidden and memory states of nodes progressively till all nodes
are updated. In addition, for each node, the forgets gates are adaptively
learned to capture different degrees of semantic correlation with neighboring
nodes. Comprehensive evaluations on four diverse semantic object parsing

Such separation is essential for efficient modeling and statistical analysis of

of variables, a starting point and a Transported Square-Root Velocity Curve
(TSRVC). A TSRVC is a curve in the tangent (vector) space at the starting point
and has some important invariance properties under the L2 norm. The space of
all such curves forms a vector bundle and the L2 norm, along with the standard
Riemannian metric on S2, provides a natural metric on this vector bundle. This
invariant representation allows for separating phase and amplitude components
in given data, using a template-based idea. Furthermore, the metric property is
useful in deriving computational procedures for clustering, mean computation,

inclinations of Tethys, Dione and Rhea suggest that the system did cross the
Dione-Rhea 5:3 resonance, which is closely followed by a Tethys-Dione secular
resonance. A clear implication is that either the moons are significantly
younger than the planet, or that their tidal evolution must be extremely slow

eccentricity. We speculate that this disk has formed through orbital
instability and massive collisions involving the previous generation of
Saturn's mid-sized moons. We identify the solar evection resonance perturbing a

analysis has been being developed in order to deal with the corresponding
problems in random environments such as analysis of conditional convex risk
measures and the related variational problems and optimization problems. Random
convex analysis is convex analysis over random locally convex modules. Since
random locally convex modules have the more complicated topological and
algebraic structures than ordinary locally convex spaces, establishing random
convex analysis will encounter harder mathematical challenges than classical
convex analysis so that there are still a lot of fundamentally important
unsolved problems in random convex analysis. This paper is devoted to solving
some important theoretic problems. First, we establish the inferior limit
behavior of a proper lower semicontinuous $L^0$--convex function on a random
locally convex module endowed with the locally $L^0$--convex topology, which
makes perfect the Fenchel--Moreau duality theorem for such functions. Then, we
investigate the relations among continuity, locally $L^0$--Lipschitzian
continuity and almost surely sequent continuity of a proper $L^0$--convex
function. And then, we establish the elegant relationships among
subdifferentiability, G\^ateaux--differentiability and
Fr\'ech\'et--differentiability for a proper $L^0$--convex function defined on
random normed modules. At last, based on the Ekeland's variational principle
for a proper lower semicontinuous $\bar{L}^0$--valued function, we show that
$\varepsilon$--subdifferentials can be approximated by subdifferentials. We
would like to emphasize that the success of this paper lies in simultaneously
considering the $(\varepsilon, \lambda)$--topology and the locally
$L^0$--convex topology for a random locally convex module.

for a given set of vertices in the plane, the problem Minimum Perimeter Polygon
(MPP) asks for a (not necessarily simply connected) polygon with shortest
possible boundary length. Even though the closely related problem of finding a
minimum cycle cover is polynomially solvable by matching techniques, we prove
how the topological structure of a polygon leads to NP-hardness of the MPP. On
the positive side, we show how to achieve a constant-factor approximation.
  When trying to solve MPP instances to provable optimality by means of integer
programming, an additional difficulty compared to the TSP is the fact that only
a subset of subtour constraints is valid, depending not on combinatorics, but
on geometry. We overcome this difficulty by establishing and exploiting
additional geometric properties. This allows us to reliably solve a wide range
of benchmark instances with up to 600 vertices within reasonable time on a
standard machine. We also show that using a natural geometry-based
sparsification yields results that are on average within 0.5% of the optimum.

time-of-flight (TOF) mass spectrometry (MS) may be used to produce protein
profiles from biological samples with the aim of discovering biomarkers for
disease. However, the raw protein profiles suffer from several sources of bias
or systematic variation which need to be removed via pre-processing before
meaningful downstream analysis of the data can be undertaken. Baseline
subtraction, an early pre-processing step that removes the non-peptide signal
from the spectra, is complicated by the following: (i) each spectrum has, on
average, wider peaks for peptides with higher mass-to-charge ratios (m/z), and
(ii) the time-consuming and error-prone trial-and-error process for optimising
the baseline subtraction input arguments. With reference to the aforementioned
complications, we present an automated pipeline that includes (i) a novel
`continuous' line segment algorithm that efficiently operates over data with a
transformed m/z-axis to remove the relationship between peptide mass and peak
width, and (ii) an input-free algorithm to estimate peak widths on the
transformed m/z scale. The automated baseline subtraction method was deployed
on six publicly available proteomic MS datasets using six different m/z-axis
transformations. Optimality of the automated baseline subtraction pipeline was
assessed quantitatively using the mean absolute scaled error (MASE) when
compared to a gold-standard baseline subtracted signal. Near-optimal baseline
subtraction was achieved using the automated pipeline. The advantages of the
proposed pipeline include informed and data specific input arguments for
baseline subtraction methods, the avoidance of time-intensive and subjective
piecewise baseline subtraction, and the ability to automate baseline
subtraction completely. Moreover, individual steps can be adopted as
stand-alone routines.

  Clustering-based Predictors",,,,,"stat.ML cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  This study addresses the issue of predicting the glaucomatous visual field
loss from patient disease datasets. Our goal is to accurately predict the
progress of the disease in individual patients. As very few measurements are
available for each patient, it is difficult to produce good predictors for
individuals. A recently proposed clustering-based method enhances the power of
prediction using patient data with similar spatiotemporal patterns. Each
patient is categorized into a cluster of patients, and a predictive model is
constructed using all of the data in the class. Predictions are highly
dependent on the quality of clustering, but it is difficult to identify the
best clustering method. Thus, we propose a method for aggregating cluster-based
predictors to obtain better prediction accuracy than from a single
cluster-based prediction. Further, the method shows very high performances by
hierarchically aggregating experts generated from several cluster-based
methods. We use real datasets to demonstrate that our method performs
significantly better than conventional clustering-based and patient-wise
regression methods, because the hierarchical aggregating strategy has a
mechanism whereby good predictors in a small community can thrive.

and $\phi$CDM models) with massive neutrinos assuming two different neutrino
mass hierarchies in both the spatially flat and non-flat scenarios, where in
the $\phi$CDM model the scalar field possesses an inverse power-law potential,
$V(\phi)\propto {\phi}^{-\alpha}$ ($\alpha>0$). Cosmic microwave background
data from Planck 2015, baryon acoustic oscillations data from 6dFGS, SDSS-MGS,
BOSS-LOWZ and BOSS CMASS-DR11, the JLA compilation of Type Ia supernova
apparent magnitude observations, and the Hubble Space Telescope $H_0$ prior,
are jointly employed to constrain the model parameters. We first determine
constraints assuming three species of degenerate massive neutrinos. In the
spatially flat (non-flat) $\Lambda$CDM model, the sum of neutrino masses is
bounded as $\Sigma m_{\nu} < 0.165 (0.299)$ eV at 95% confidence level (CL).
Correspondingly, in the flat (non-flat) $\phi$CDM model, we find $\Sigma
m_{\nu} < 0.164 (0.301)$ eV at 95% CL. The inclusion of spatial curvature as a
free parameter results in a significant broadening of confidence regions for
$\Sigma m_{\nu}$ and other parameters. In the scenario where the total neutrino
mass is dominated by the heaviest neutrino mass eigenstate, we can obtain the
similar conclusions as those obtained in the degenerate neutrino mass scenario.
In addition, the results show that the bounds on $\Sigma m_{\nu}$ based on two
different neutrino mass hierarchies have insignificant differences in the
spatially flat case for both the $\Lambda$CDM and $\phi$CDM models, however,
the corresponding differences are larger in the non-flat case.

conjectured that if $f\in \mathcal S$, then $|\Phi_1 (n,f)|\leq (n-1)^2$ for

Fekete-Szeg\H{o} functional of the $n$-th root transform of the corresponding

special geometric subclasses of $\mathcal S$ but the conjecture remains open
for $f\in {\mathcal S}$ and for $n > 6$. In the present paper, we prove sharp

reported in numerical simulation studies of such flows. Moreover, the published
simulation results fail to predict the post-solidification pool shape without
adapting non-physical values for input parameters, suggesting the neglect of
significant physics in the models employed. The experimentally observed violent
flow surface instabilities, scaling analyses for the occurrence of turbulence
in Marangoni driven flows, and the fact that in simulations transport
coefficients generally have to be increased by an order of magnitude to match
experimentally observed pool shapes, suggest the common assumption of laminar
flow in the pool may not hold, and that the flow is actually turbulent. Here,
we use direct numerical simulations (DNS) to investigate the role of turbulence
in laser melting of a steel alloy with surface active elements. Our results
reveal the presence of two competing vortices driven by thermocapillary forces
towards a local surface tension maximum. The jet away from this location at the
free surface, separating the two vortices, is found to be unstable and highly
oscillatory, indeed leading to turbulence-like flow in the pool. The resulting
additional heat transport, however, is insufficient to account for the observed
differences in pool shapes between experiment and simulations.

the 16293E prestellar core, where the N$^{15}$NH$^+$ $J$=1-0 line was detected.
Using a model previously developed for the physical structure of the source, we
solved the molecular excitation with a non-local radiative transfer code. For
that purpose, we computed specific collisional rate coefficients for the

convenience, the length element of the magnetic-field extrapolation is 1

symmetry energy in the domain of sub-saturation densities, is investigated
within an isospin dependent transport model. The single and double ratios of
neutron/proton from free nucleons and light clusters (complex particles) in the
isotopic reactions are analyzed systematically. Isospin effects of particles
produced from the neck fragmentations are explored, which are constrained
within the midrapidities ($|y/y_{proj}|<$0.3) and azimuthal angles
(70$^{o}\sim$110$^{o}$, 250$^{o}\sim$290$^{o}$) in semiperipheral nuclear
collisions. It is found that the ratios of the energetic isospin particles
strongly depend on the stiffness of nuclear symmetry energy and the effects
increase with softening the symmetry energy, which would be a nice probe for
extracting the symmetry energy below the normal density in experimentally. A
flat structure appears at the tail spectra from the double ratio distributions.
The neutron to proton ratio of light intermediate mass fragments (IMFs) with

with less sensitivity in comparison to the isospin ratios of nucleons and light

correction (DFT-D3) changes the relaxation of density-density time correlation
functions from a slow, typical of a supercooled state, to exponential decay
behaviour of regular liquids. This implies an essential reduction of the
melting point of ice in simulations with DFT-D3. Analysis of longitudinal (L)

dispersions of acoustic and optic collective excitations and to observe the L-T

lower frequencies and provides by almost thirty per cent smaller gap between
the longest-wavelength LO and TO excitations, which can be a consequence of a
larger effective high-frequency dielectric permittivity in simulations with
dispersion corrections. Simulation in ordinary water with the dispersion

excitation temperatures, measured throughout much of the observed region using

introduce cycles of varying length and analyze how this feature, as well as the

size of the graph tends to infinity. The interest in these random variables is
due to the fact that the configuration model, conditioned on being simple, is a
uniform random graph with prescribed degrees. Simplicity corresponds to the
absence of self-loops and multiple edges. We show that the number of self-loops
and multiple edges converges in distribution to two independent Poisson random
variables when the second moment of the empirical degree distribution
converges. We also provide an estimate on the total variation distance between
the number of self-loops and multiple edges and the Poisson limit of their sum.
This revisits previous works of Bollob\'as, of Janson, of Wormald and others.
The error estimates also imply sharp asymptotics for the number of simple

of Stein's method for Poisson convergence, which is a novel method for this
problem. The asymptotic independence of self-loops and multiple edges follows
from a Poisson version of the Cram\'er-Wold device using thinning, which is of
independent interest. When the degree distribution has infinite second moment,
our general results break down. We can, however, prove a central limit theorem

by quenching or ramping the interaction parameter, is studied within the
framework of the nonequilibrium self-energy functional theory. A dynamical
impurity approximation with a single auxiliary bath site is considered as a
reference system and the time-dependent hybridization is optimized as
prescribed by the variational principle. The dynamical two-site approximation
turns out to be useful to study the real-time dynamics on short and
intermediate time scales. Depending on the strength of the interaction in the
final state, two qualitatively different response regimes are observed. For
both weak and strong couplings, qualitative agreement with previous results of
nonequilibrium dynamical mean-field theory is found. The two regimes are

(EFV) and Lamivudine (3TC), usually present in the HIV cocktail, can be done by
individual adjustment of the solid decomposition models. However, in some cases
unacceptable errors are found using this methodology. To circumvent this
problem, here is proposed to use a multilayer perceptron neural network (MLP),
with an appropriate algorithm, which constitutes a linearization of the network
by setting weights between the input layer and the intermediate one and the use
of Kinetic models as activation functions of neurons in the hidden layer. The
interconnection weights between that intermediate layer and output layer
determines the contribution of each model in the overall fit of the
experimental data. Thus, the decomposition is assumed to be a phenomenon that
can occur following different kinetic processes. In the investigated data, the
kinetic thermal decomposition process was best described by R1 and D4 model for
all temperatures to EFV and 3TC, respectively. The residual error adjustment
over the network is on average 10$^{3}$ times lower for EFV and 10$^{2}$ times
lower for 3TC compared to the best individual kinetic model that describes the
process. These improvements in physical adjustment allow detailed study of the
process and therefore a more accurate calculation of the kinetic parameters
such as the activation energy and frequency factor. It was found Ea=75.230
kJ/mol and ln(A)=3.2190x10$^{-16}$ s$^{-1}$ for EFV and Ea=103.25 kJ/mol and
ln(A)= 2.5587X10$^{3}$ s$^{-1}$ for 3TC.

radial position of this accretion shock tracks closely the position of the

apply a learning method to a token sequence derived from the database. We
describe various techniques for extracting token sequences from a database. The
techniques differ in complexity, in the token sequences they output and in the

algebraically quantify semantic relationships between the tokens such as
similarities and analogies. Vectors enable a dual view of the data: relational

a new class of queries called cognitive intelligence (CI) queries that extract

vectors. We have implemented a prototype system on top of Spark to exhibit the
power of CI queries. Here, CI queries are realized via SQL UDFs. This power
goes far beyond text extensions to relational systems due to the information
encoded in vectors. We also consider various extensions to the basic scheme,
including using a collection of views derived from the database to focus on a

maintaining vectors as the database evolves and exploring a database without
utilizing its schema. For the latter, we consider minimal extensions to SQL to

in dramatic interference effects associated with Fano resonances. Such devices
offer appealing alternatives to distributed Bragg reflectors or filters for

reflectors, semiconductor lasers, photodetectors, bio-sensors, or non-linear

of optomechanics, where the mechanical modes of a suspended slab interact via
radiation pressure with the optical field of a high finesse cavity. The
reflectivity and transmission properties of a defect-free suspended PCS around
normal incidence can be used to couple out-of-plane mechanical modes to an
optical field by integrating it in a free space cavity. Here, we demonstrate
the successful implementation of a PCS reflector on a high-tensile stress
Si$_3$N$_4$ nanomembrane. We illustrate the physical process underlying the
high reflectivity by measuring the photonic crystal band diagram. Moreover, we
introduce a clear theoretical description of the membrane scattering properties
in the presence of optical losses. By embedding the PCS inside a high-finesse
cavity, we fully characterize its optical properties. The spectrally, angular,
and polarization resolved measurements demonstrate the wide tunability of the
membrane's reflectivity, from nearly 0 to 99.9470~$\pm$ 0.0025 \%, and show
that material absorption is not the main source of optical loss. Moreover, the
cavity storage time demonstrated in this work exceeds the mechanical period of
low-order mechanical drum modes. This so-called resolved sideband condition is

  merger-driven cluster formation","22 pages, accepted for publication in MNRAS",,"10.1093/mnras/stw714",,"astro-ph.GA","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  This paper discusses a new method to generate self-coherent initial
conditions for young substructured stellar cluster. The expansion of a uniform
system allows stellar sub-structures (clumps) to grow from fragmentation modes
by adiabatic cooling. We treat the system mass elements as stars, chosen
according to a Salpeter mass function, and the time-evolution is performed with
a collisional N-body integrator. This procedure allows to create a
fully-coherent relation between the clumps' spatial distribution and the
underlying velocity field. The cooling is driven by the gravitational field, as
in a cosmological Hubble-Lema\^itre flow. The fragmented configuration has a
`fractal'-like geometry but with a self-grown velocity field and mass profile.
We compare the characteristics of the stellar population in clumps with that
obtained from hydrodynamical simulations and find a remarkable correspondence
between the two in terms of the stellar content and the degree of spatial
mass-segregation. In the fragmented configuration, the IMF power index is ~0.3
lower in clumps in comparison to the field stellar population, in agreement
with observations in the Milky Way. We follow in time the dynamical evolution
of fully fragmented and sub-virial configurations, and find a soft collapse,
leading rapidly to equilibrium (timescale of 1 Myr for a ~ 10^4 Msun system).
The low-concentration equilibrium implies that the dynamical evolution
including massive stars is less likely to induce direct collisions and the
formation of exotic objects. Low-mass stars already ejected from merging clumps
are depleted in the end-result stellar clusters, which harbour a top-heavy
stellar mass function.

energy propagating with the light pulse in the medium is entirely carried by
the field. Thus, the possibility that the optical force field of the light
pulse would drive forward an atomic mass density wave (MDW) and the related
kinetic and elastic energies is neglected. In this work, we present foundations
of a covariant theory of light propagation in a medium by considering a light
wave simultaneously with the dynamics of the medium atoms driven by optoelastic
forces between the induced dipoles and the electromagnetic field. We prove that
the transfer of mass as MDW associated with the light pulse, the photon mass
drag effect, gives an essential contribution to the total momentum of the light
pulse, which becomes equal to the Minkowski momentum. Thus, our theory also
resolves the centenary Abraham-Minkowski controversy of the momentum of light
in a nondispersive medium. We derive the photon mass drag effect using two
independent but complementary covariant models. In the mass-polariton (MP)
quasiparticle approach, we consider the light pulse as a coupled state between
the photon and matter, isolated from the rest of the medium. The momentum and
the transferred mass of MP follow unambiguously from the Lorentz invariance and
the fundamental conservation laws of nature. To enable the calculation of the
mass and momentum distribution of a light pulse, we have also generalized the
electrodynamics of continuous media to account for the optoelastic dynamics of
the medium. In this optoelastic continuum dynamics (OCD) approach, we obtain a
numerically accurate solution of the Newtonian continuum dynamics of the medium
when the light pulse is propagating in it. We finally discuss a possibility of
an optical waveguide setup for experimental measurement of the transferred mass
of the light pulse.

involves a legitimate receiver that wishes to reliably and efficiently compute
a function of distributed binary sources while an eavesdropper has to be kept
ignorant of them. In order to characterize the corresponding fundamental limit,
the notion of secrecy computation-capacity is introduced. Although determining
the secrecy computation-capacity is challenging for arbitrary functions, it
surprisingly turns out that if the function perfectly matches the algebraic
structure of the channel and the joint source distribution fulfills certain
conditions, the secrecy computation-capacity equals the computation capacity,
which is the supremum of all achievable computation rates without secrecy
constraints. Unlike the case of securely transmitting messages, no additional
randomness is needed at the encoders nor does the legitimate receiver need any
advantage over the eavesdropper. The results therefore show that the problem of
securely computing a function over a multiple-access wiretap channel may
significantly differ from the one of securely communicating messages.

continuous wave (CW) EPR spectroscopy is extended to a Rabi resonance
condition, when the radio frequency of the magnetic-field modulation matches
the Rabi frequency of a spin system in the microwave field. Using the
non-secular perturbation theory based on the Bogoliubov averaging method, the
analytical description of the response of the spin system is derived for all
modulation frequency harmonics. When the modulation frequency exceeds the EPR
linewidth, multi-photon transitions result in sidebands in absorption EPR
spectra measured with phase-sensitive detection at any harmonic. The saturation
of different-order multi-photon transitions is shown to be significantly
different and to be sensitive to the Rabi resonance. The noticeable frequency
shifts of sidebands are found to be the signatures of this resonance. The
inversion of two-photon lines in some spectral intervals of the out-of-phase
first-harmonic signal is predicted under passage through the Rabi resonance.
The inversion indicates the transition from absorption to stimulated emission
or vice versa, depending on the sideband. The manifestation of the primary and
secondary Rabi resonance is also demonstrated in time-resolved steady-state EPR
signals formed by all harmonics of the modulation frequency. Our results
provide a theoretical framework for future developments in multi-photon CW EPR

that already at the very first layer, domain shift effects pop up. We then
propose a new domain adaptation method, where first layer convolutional filters

exhibit a sharp transition from glassy solid to liquid-like behavior with

well below the glass transition temperature, T$_{\mathrm{g}}$. The enhanced
dynamics in these films can produce large scale morphological features during
PVD and lead to a dewetting instability in films held at temperatures as low as
T$_{\mathrm{g}}$-35 K. We measure the effective viscosity of organic glass
films by monitoring the dewetting kinetics. These measurements combined with
cooling rate-dependent T$_{\mathrm{g}}$ measurements show that the apparent
activation barrier for rearrangement decreases sharply in films thinner than 30
nm. These observations suggest long-range facilitation of dynamics induced by
the free surface, with dramatic effects on the properties of nano-scale
amorphous materials.

But this inspires one to seek the answer from other phenomenological
frameworks. We need a proper parametrization of the neutrino mass matrices
concerning individual hierarchies. In the present work, we attempt to study the
six different cases of Quasi-degenerate (QDN) neutrino models. The related mass
matrices, $m_{LL}^{\nu}$ are parametrized with two free parameters
($\alpha,\eta$) and standard Wolfenstein parameter ($\lambda$). The input mass
scale $m_0$ is selected around $\sim 0.08\,eV$. We begin with a $\mu-\tau$
symmetric neutrino mass matrix tailed by a correction from charged lepton
sector. The parametrization accentuates the existence of four independent
texture zero building block matrices which are common to all the QDN models
under $\mu-\tau$ symmetric framework. These remain invariant irrespective of
any choice of solar angle. In our parametrization, the neutrino sector controls
the solar angle, whereas the reactor and atmospheric angles are dictated by the
charged lepton sector. In the framework of oscillation experiments,
cosmological observation and future experiments involving $\beta$-decay and
$0\nu\beta\beta$ experiments, all QDN models are tested and a reason to rule
out anyone out of the six models is unfounded. A strong preference for
$\sin^2\theta_{12}=0.32$ is observed for QDNH-$Type A$ model.

conditions: the encounter must be more distant than ~150 au to avoid perturbing
the Kuiper belt; the other star must have a wide-orbit planet (a>~100au); the
planet must be captured onto an appropriate orbit to sculpt the orbital
distribution of wide-orbit Solar System bodies. Here we use N-body simulations
to show that these criteria may be simultaneously satisfied. In a few percent
of slow close encounters in a cluster, bodies are captured onto heliocentric,
Planet 9-like orbits. During the ~100 Myr cluster phase, many stars are likely
to host planets on highly-eccentric orbits with apastron distances beyond 100
au if Neptune-sized planets are common and susceptible to planet--planet
scattering. While the existence of Planet 9 remains unproven, we consider
capture from one of the Sun's young brethren a plausible route to explain such
an object's orbit. Capture appears to predict a large population of
Trans-Neptunian Objects (TNOs) whose orbits are aligned with the captured
planet, and we propose that different formation mechanisms will be
distinguishable based on their imprint on the distribution of TNOs.

$3\times10^9\,M_\odot$ based on the far-IR spectroscopy taken with {\it
Herschel Space Observatory}. We detect the [OI]63$\mu$m ([CII]158$\mu$m)
emission in 6(8) out of 8(9) sources. Our QSO sample has far-infrared
luminosities (LFIR)~several times $10^{11}L_\odot$. The observed line-to-LFIR
ratios (LOI/LFIR and LCII/LFIR) are in the ranges of
$2.6\times10^{-4}$-$10^{-2}$ and $2.8\times10^{-4}$-$2\times10^{-3}$
respectively (including upper limits). These ratios are comparable to the
values found in local ULIRGs, but higher than the average value published so
far for $z$$>$1 IR bright QSOs. One target, W0752+19, shows an additional broad
velocity component (~720 km/s), and exceptionally strong [OI]63$\mu$m emission
with LOI/LFIR of $10^{-2}$, an order of magnitude higher than that of average
value found among local (U)LIRGs. Combining with the analyses of the {\it SDSS}
optical spectra, we conclude that the [OI]63$\mu$m emission in these QSOs is
unlikely excited by shocks. We infer that the broad [OI]63 micron emission in
W0752+19 could arise from the warm and dense ISM in the narrow line region of
the central AGN. Another possible explanation is the existence of a dense gas
outflow with $n_{\rm H}\sim10^4$\,cm$^{-3}$, where the corresponding broad
[CII] emission is suppressed. Based on the far-IR [OI] and [CII] line ratios,
we estimate the constraints on the ISM density and UV radiation field intensity
of $n_{\rm H} \lesssim 10^{3.3}$ cm$^{-3}$ and $10^3<G_0 \lesssim 10^{4.2}$,
respectively. These values are consistent with those found in local Seyfert 1
ULIRGs. In contrast, the gas with broad velocity width in W0752+19 has $n_{\rm
H} \gtrsim 10^{4.3}$ cm$^{-3}$ and $G_0>10^4$.

classical information channel: the detector clicks $\rightarrow$ the poison is

groundbreaking new concept in optical interference coatings. Building upon our
initial demonstration of this technology, we have now realized significant
improvements in the limiting optical performance of these novel single-crystal
$GaAs/Al_{x}Ga_{1-x}As$ multilayers. In the near-infrared (NIR), for coating
center wavelengths spanning 1064 to 1560 nm, we have reduced the excess optical
losses (scatter + absorption) to levels as low as 3 parts per million, enabling
the realization of a cavity finesse exceeding $3\times 10^{5}$ at the
telecom-relevant wavelength range near 1550 nm. Moreover, we demonstrate the
direct measurement of sub-ppm optical absorption at 1064 nm. Concurrently, we
investigate the mid-IR (MIR) properties of these coatings and observe
exceptional performance for first attempts in this important wavelength region.
Specifically, we verify excess losses at the hundred ppm level for wavelengths
of 3300 and 3700 nm. Taken together, our NIR optical losses are now fully
competitive with ion beam sputtered multilayer coatings, while our first
prototype MIR optics have already reached state-of-the-art performance levels
for reflectors covering this portion of the fingerprint region for optical gas
sensing. Mirrors fabricated with our crystalline coating technique exhibit the
lowest mechanical loss, and thus the lowest Brownian noise, the highest thermal
conductivity, and, potentially, the widest spectral coverage of any
""supermirror"" technology in a single material platform. Looking ahead, we see a
bright future for crystalline coatings in applications requiring the ultimate
levels of optical, thermal, and optomechanical performance

correspondence with the known physics of fermions, inherent causality
properties in their most fundamental constructions, and positive mass
eigenvalues for all particle types. The algebra of the generators for
infinitesimal transformations of these fields directly constructs the Minkowski
metric \emph{within} the internal group space as a consequence of non-vanishing
commutation relations between generators that carry space-time indexes. In
addition, the generators have a fundamental matrix representation that includes
Lorentz transformations within a group that unifies internal gauge symmetries
generated by a set of hermitian generators for SU(3)$\times$SU(2)$\times$U(1),
and nothing else. The construction of linearly independent internal SU(3) and
SU(2) symmetry groups necessarily involves the mixing of three generations of
the mass eigenstates labeling the (massive) representations of the linear
spinor fields. The group algebra also provides a mechanism for the dynamic
mixing of massless particles of differing ""transverse mass"" eigenvalues
conjugate to the affine parameter labeling translations along their light-like
trajectories. The inclusion of a transverse mass generator is necessary for
group closure of the extended Poincare algebra, but its eigenvalue must vanish
for massive particle representations. A unified set of space-time group
transformation operations along with internal gauge group symmetry operations
for linear spinor fields will be demonstrated in this paper.

oscillations of the finite discrete system of harmonically-coupled pendulums
without any restrictions to their amplitudes (excluding a vicinity of $\pi$).
Although this model has numerous applications in different fields of physics it
was studied earlier in the infinite limit only. The developed approach allows
to find the dispersion relations for arbitrary amplitudes of the nonlinear
normal modes. We underline that the long-wavelength approximation, which is
described by well- known sine-Gordon equation leads to inadequate zone
structure for the amplitude order of $\pi/2$ even if the chain is long enough.
The extremely complex zone structure at the large amplitudes corresponds to lot
of resonances between nonlinear normal modes even with strongly different wave
numbers. Due to complexity of the dispersion relations the more short
wavelength modes can possess the smaller frequencies. The numerical simulation
of the dynamics of the finite-length chain is in a good agreement with obtained
analytical predictions.

main approximation leads to a normally ordered form of the interaction
Hamiltonian. Generation of the fermion mass due to the interaction with
exchange of the scalar boson is investigated. It is demonstrated that, for zero
bare mass, the fermion can acquire mass only if the coupling constant exceeds
the critical value determined by the boson mass. In this connection, the
problem of the neutrino mass is discussed.

For that, an innovative partitioning criterion with a tree-growing algorithm
will be defined. Main result is a dynamic tree structure characterized by the
simultaneous presence of binary and ternary partitions. A real world case study
will be considered to show the advantages of the proposed methodology and main
