gauge-invariant local composite operators in $\mathcal{N}=4$ super Yang-Mills
theory at various loop orders and for various numbers of external legs. We show
how to use on-shell methods for their calculation and in particular extract the
dilatation operator from the result. We also investigate the properties of the
corresponding remainder functions. Moreover, we extend on-shell diagrams, a
Gra{\ss}mannian integral formulation and an integrability-based construction
via R-operators to form factors, focussing on the chiral part of the
stress-tensor supermultiplet as an example. In the second part, we study the
$\beta$- and the $\gamma_i$-deformation, which were respectively shown to be
the most general supersymmetric and non-supersymmetric field-theory
deformations of $\mathcal{N}=4$ super Yang-Mills theory that are integrable at
the level of the asymptotic Bethe ansatz. For these theories, a new kind of
finite-size effect occurs, which we call prewrapping and which emerges from
double-trace structures that are required in the deformed Lagrangians. While
the $\beta$-deformation is conformal when the double-trace couplings are at
their non-trivial IR fixed points, the $\gamma_i$-deformation has running
double-trace couplings without fixed points, which break conformal invariance
even in the planar theory. Nevertheless, the $\gamma_i$-deformation allows for
highly non-trivial field-theoretic tests of integrability at arbitrarily high
loop orders.

temperature $T_{eff}$, the surface gravity logg, the metallicity [Fe/H], and
the equatorial projected rotational velocity vsini for ""normal"" A and Am stars.
The procedure is based on the principal component analysis inversion method of
Paletou et al. (2015a). A sample of 322 high resolution spectra of F0-B9 stars,
retrieved from the Polarbase, SOPHIE, and ELODIE databases, were used to test
this technique with real data. We have selected the spectral region from
4400-5000\AA\ as it contains many metallic lines and the Balmer H$\beta$ line.
Using 3 datasets at resolving powers of R=42000, 65000 and 76000, about
6.6x$10^6$ synthetic spectra were calculated to build a large learning
database. The Online Power Iteration algorithm was applied to these learning
datasets to estimate the principal components (PC). The projection of spectra
onto the few PCs offered an efficient comparison metric in a low dimensional
space. The spectra of the well known A0- and A1-type stars, Vega and Sirius A,
were used as control spectra in the three databases. Spectra of other well
known A-type stars were also employed in order to characterize the accuracy of
the inversion technique. All observational spectra were inverted and
atmospheric parameters derived. After removal of a few outliers, the
PCA-inversion method appears to be very efficient in determining $T_{eff}$,
[Fe/H], and vsini for A/Am stars. The derived parameters agree very well with
previous determinations. Using a statistical approach, deviations of around 150
K, 0.35 dex, 0.15 dex, and 2 km/s were found for $T_{eff}$, logg, [Fe/H], and
vsini with respect to literature values for A-type stars. The PCA-inversion
proves to be a very fast, practical, and reliable tool for estimating stellar
parameters of FGK and A stars, and deriving effective temperatures of M stars.

challenges in the calculation of opacities of hot dense plasmas. Opacity models
use line broadening approximations that are untested at stellar interior

large discrepancy in the K-shell line widths between several atomic codes and
the OP. In this work, the atomic code STAR is used to study the sensitivity of
solar opacities to line-broadening. Variations in the solar opacity profile,
due to an increase of the Stark widths resulting from discrepancies with OP,
are compared, in light of the solar opacity problem, with the required opacity
variations of the present day sun, as imposed by helioseismic and neutrino
observations. The resulting variation profile, is much larger than the
discrepancy between different atomic codes, agrees qualitatively with the
missing opacity profile, recovers about half of the missing opacity nearby the
convection boundary and has a little effect in the internal regions. Since it
is hard to estimate quantitatively the uncertainty in the Stark widths, we show
that an increase of all line widths by a factor of about 100 recovers
quantitatively the missing opacity. These results emphasize the possibility
that photoexcitation processes are not modeled properly, and more specifically,
highlight the need for a better theoretical characterization of the line
broadening phenomena at stellar interior conditions and of the uncertainty due

Balloon-borne Imaging Testbed (BIT) is an instrument designed to meet the

precursor to the development of a facility class instrument with capabilities
similar to the Hubble Space Telescope. The attitude determination and control
systems (ADCS) for BIT, the design, implementation, and analysis of which are
the focus of this paper, compensate for compound pendulation effects and other
sub-orbital disturbances in the stratosphere to within 1-2$^{\prime\prime}$
(rms), while back-end optics provide further image stabilization down to
0.05$^{\prime\prime}$ (not discussed here). During the inaugural test flight
from Timmins, Canada in September 2015, BIT ADCS pointing and stabilization
performed exceptionally, with coarse pointing and target acquisition to within
< 0.1$^\circ$ and fine stabilization to 0.68$^{\prime\prime}$ (rms) over long
(10-30 minute) integrations. This level of performance was maintained during
flight for several tracking runs that demonstrated pointing stability on the
sky for more than an hour at a time. To refurbish and improve the system for
the three-month flight from New Zealand in 2018, certain modifications to the
ADCS need to be made to smooth pointing mode transitions and to correct for
internal biases observed during the test flight. Furthermore, the level of
autonomy must be increased for future missions to improve system reliability

component plus a wider plateau. Very similar profiles have been observed in CO
lines from some AGB stars and most post-AGB nebulae and, in these cases, they

bipolar dynamics.
  We present systematic observations of 28SiO v=0 J=1-0 emission in 28 evolved
stars, performed with the 40~m radio telescope of the IGN in Yebes, Spain. We
find that the composite core plus plateau profiles are almost always present in
O-rich Miras, OH/IR stars, and red supergiants. They are also found in one
S-type Mira ($\chi$ Cyg), as well as in two semiregular variables (X Her and RS
Cnc) that are known to show axial symmetry. In the other objects, the profiles
are simpler and similar to those of other molecular lines. The composite
structure appears in the objects in which SiO emission is thought to come from
the very inner circumstellar layers, prior to dust formation. The central
spectral feature is found to be systematically composed of a number of narrow
spikes, except for X Her and RS Cnc, in which it shows a smooth shape that is
very similar to that observed in CO emission. These spikes show a significant
(and mostly chaotic) time variation, while in all cases the smooth components
remain constant within the uncertainties. The profile shape could come from the
superposition of standard wide profiles and a group of weak maser spikes.
Alternatively, we speculate that the very similar profiles detected in objects
that are axisymmetric may be indicative of the systematic presence of a
significant axial symmetry in the very inner circumstellar shells around AGB
stars; the presence of such symmetry would be independent of the probable weak
maser effects in the central spikes.

to the stress caused by propagating acoustic waves. The underlying mechanism is
that the stress induced by the acoustic waves exceeds the strength of the snow

wave propagation in a porous material. The simulation consists of an acoustic
domain for the air above the snowpack and a poroelastic domain for the dry
snowpack. The two domains are connected by a wave field decomposition and open
pore boundary conditions. Empirical relations are used to derive a porous model
of the snowpack from density profiles of the field experiment. Biot's equations
are solved in the poroelastic domain to obtain simulated accelerations in the

identified by comparing the principal normal and shear stress fields to snow
strength which is assumed to be a function of snow porosity. One air pressure
measurement above the snowpack was used to calibrate the pressure amplitude of
the source in the simulation. Additional field measurements of air pressure and
acceleration measurements inside the snowpack were compared to individual field

both classes are $(1/2)^-$ H\""older continuously differentiable in space when
$d=1$, and we give the exact uniform and local moduli of continuity for the
gradient in both cases. This is unprecedented for SPDEs driven by space-time
white noise. Our results on exact moduli show that the half-derivative SPIDE is
a critical case. It signals the onset of rougher modulus regularity in space
than both time-fractional SPIDEs with time-derivatives of order $<1/2$ and L-KS
SPDEs. This is despite the fact that they all have identical spatial H\""older
regularity, as shown earlier by Allouba. Moreover, we show that the temporal
laws governing (1) and (2) are fundamentally different. We relate L-KS SPDEs to
the Houdr\'e-Villa bifractional Brownian motion, yielding a Chung-type law of
the iterated logarithm for these SPDEs. We use the underlying explicit kernels
and spectral/harmonic analysis to prove our results. On one hand, this work
builds on the recent works on delicate sample path properties of Gaussian

the impact of this choice on the exchange-correlation potential when the
physical system begins in a 50:50 superposition of the ground and first-excited
state of the system. We investigate the possibility of judiciously choosing a
Kohn-Sham initial state that minimizes errors when adiabatic functionals are

matching the one that dominates the interacting state, this can be achieved for
a finite time duration for some but not all such choices. When the Kohn-Sham
system does not begin in a Slater determinant, we further argue that the
conventional splitting of the exchange-correlation potential into exchange and
correlation parts has limited value, and instead propose a decomposition into a
""single-particle"" contribution that we denote $v_{xc}^s$, and a remainder. The
single-particle contribution can be readily computed as an explicit
orbital-functional, reduces to exchange in the Slater determinant case, and
offers an alternative to the adiabatic approximation as a starting point for
TDDFT approximations.

can affect the ionization balance in their outer atmospheres, and can be the
mechanism responsible for the production of highly ionized species. To allow
for these processes in the context of spectral analysis, we have implemented
such emission into our unified, NLTE model atmosphere/spectrum synthesis code
FASTWIND.
  The shock structure and corresponding emission is calculated as a function of
user-supplied parameters. We account for a temperature and density
stratification inside the post-shock cooling zones, calculated for radiative
and adiabatic cooling in the inner and outer wind, respectively. The
high-energy absorption of the cool wind is considered by adding important
K-shell opacities, and corresponding Auger ionization rates have been included
into the NLTE network.
  We tested and verified our implementation carefully against corresponding
results from various alternative model atmosphere codes, and studied the
effects from shock emission for important ions from He, C, N, O, Si, and P.
Surprisingly, dielectronic recombination turned out to play an essential role
for the ionization balance of OIV/OV around Teff = 45,000 K. Finally, we
investigated the behavior of the mass absorption coefficient, kappa_nu(r),
important in the context of X-ray line formation in massive star winds.
  In almost all considered cases, direct ionization is of major influence, and
Auger ionization significantly affects only NVI and OVI. The approximation of a
radially constant kappa_nu is justified for r > 1.2 Rstar and lambda < 18 A,
and also for many models at longer wavelengths. To estimate the actual value of
this quantity, however, the HeII opacities need to be calculated from detailed
NLTE modeling, at least for wavelengths longer than 18 to 20 A, and information
on the individual CNO abundances has to be present.

rival particles for edge domination. Active particles randomly walk in the
network until they are absorbed by either a rival vertex or an edge currently
dominated by rival particles. The result from the model evolution consists of
sets of edges arranged by the label dominance. Each set tends to form a
connected subnetwork to represent a data class. Although the intrinsic dynamics
of the model is a stochastic one, we prove there exists a deterministic version
with largely reduced computational complexity; specifically, with linear
growth. Furthermore, the edge domination process corresponds to an unfolding
map in such way that edges ""stretch"" and ""shrink"" according to the vertex-edge
dynamics. Consequently, the unfolding effect summarizes the relevant
relationships between vertices and the uncovered data classes. The proposed
model captures important details of connectivity patterns over the vertex-edge

We adopted the classical PUI model with isotropic distribution function and

reproduction of the PUI count rate along the Earth orbit. However, the temporal
and latitudinal variations of the ionization in the heliosphere, and
particularly their variation on the solar cycle time-scale, may significantly
modify the shape of PUI cone and crescent and also their peak positions from
year to year and thus bias by a few degrees the derived longitude of the ISN

when the latter is placed on a random surface of bounded genus, effectively
leaving a smaller set of independent boundary conditions. This curious and

the polarimetric imaging capability of SPHERE-ZIMPOL combined with the superb
adaptive optics performance, we have succeeded in spatially resolving three
clumpy dust clouds located at ~50 mas (~2 Rstar) from the central star,
revealing dust formation very close to the star. The AMBER data in the
individual CO lines suggest a molecular outer atmosphere extending to ~3 Rstar.
Furthermore, the SPHERE-ZIMPOL image taken over the Halpha line shows emission
with a radius of up to ~160 mas (~7 Rstar). We found that dust, molecular gas,
and Halpha-emitting hot gas are coexisting within 2--3 Rstar. Our modeling
suggests that the observed polarized intensity maps can reasonably be explained
by large (0.4--0.5 micron) grains of Al2O3 or Mg2SiO4 or MgSiO3 in an optically
thin shell with an inner boundary radius of 1.9--2.0 Rstar. The observed clumpy
structure can be reproduced by a density enhancement by a factor of 4 +/- 1.
The grain size derived from our polarimetric images is consistent with the
prediction of the hydrodynamical models for the mass loss driven by the
scattering due to micron-sized grains. The detection of the clumpy dust clouds
close to the star lends support to the dust formation induced by pulsation and
large convective cells as predicted by the 3-D simulations for AGB stars.

constraints on the 3-D spatial distribution of the emissivity, as well as on
the structure of both ordered and random magnetic fields (MFs), we present here
a scheme to model maps of the emission and polarization in SNRs.
  We first generalize the classical treatment of the synchrotron emission to
the case in which the MF is composed by an ordered MF plus an isotropic random
component, with arbitrary relative strengths. In the case of a power-law
particle energy distribution, we derive analytic formulae that formally
resemble those for the classical case. We also treat the case of a shock
compression of a fully random upstream field and we predict that the
polarization fraction in this case should be higher than typically measured in
SNRs. We implement the above treatment into a code, which simulates the
observed polarized emission of an emitting shell, taking into account also the
effect of the internal Faraday rotation.
  Finally, we show simulated maps for different orientations with respect to
the observer, levels of the turbulent MF component, Faraday rotation levels,
distributions of the emissivity (either barrel-shaped or limited to polar
caps), and geometries for the ordered MF component (either tangential to the
shell, or radial). Their analysis allows us to outline properties useful for

congestion and improve utilization by balancing load across multiple paths.
Current approaches to traffic engineering can be modeled in terms of a routing
component that computes forwarding paths, and a load balancing component that
maps incoming flows onto those paths dynamically, adjusting sending rates to
fit current conditions. Unfortunately, existing systems rely on simple
strategies for one or both of these components, which leads to poor performance
or requires making frequent updates to forwarding paths, significantly
increasing management complexity. This paper explores a different approach
based on semi-oblivious routing, a natural extension of oblivious routing in
which the system computes a diverse set of paths independent of demands, but
also dynamically adapts sending rates as conditions change. Semi-oblivious
routing has a number of important advantages over competing approaches
including low overhead, nearly optimal performance, and built-in protection
against unexpected bursts of traffic and failures. Through in-depth simulations
and a deployment on SDN hardware, we show that these benefits are robust, and
hold across a wide range of topologies, demands, resource budgets, and failure

assumptions that the interest in the topic as well as the number of available

the interest scales as an inverse power law in time, the cumulative number of
papers on a topic is well described by a di-gamma function, with a distinct
logarithmic behavior at large times. In cases where the interest decreases
exponentially with time, the model predicts that the total number of papers on

small power asymmetry, consistent with these observations. Observations of

much smaller angular scales. Here, we propose to use off-diagonal components of
the angular power spectrum of the 21-cm fluctuations during the dark ages to
test this power asymmetry. We forecast results for the planned SKA radio array,
a future radio array, and the cosmic-variance-limited case as a theoretical

computationally efficient encoding and decoding procedures. An MDS code with
$r$ redundancy nodes can correct any $r$ node erasures by accessing all the
remaining information in the surviving nodes. However, in practice, $e$
erasures is a more likely failure event, for $1\le e<r$. Hence, a natural
question is how much information do we need to access in order to rebuild $e$
storage nodes? We define the rebuilding ratio as the fraction of remaining
information accessed during the rebuilding of $e$ erasures. In our previous
work we constructed MDS codes, called zigzag codes, that achieve the optimal
rebuilding ratio of $1/r$ for the rebuilding of any systematic node when $e=1$,
however, all the information needs to be accessed for the rebuilding of the
parity node erasure.
  The (normalized) repair bandwidth is defined as the fraction of information
transmitted from the remaining nodes during the rebuilding process. For codes
that are not necessarily MDS, Dimakis et al. proposed the regenerating codes
framework where any $r$ erasures can be corrected by accessing some of the
remaining information, and any $e=1$ erasure can be rebuilt from some subsets
of surviving nodes with optimal repair bandwidth.
  In this work, we study 3 questions on rebuilding of codes: (i) We show a
fundamental trade-off between the storage size of the node and the repair
bandwidth similar to the regenerating codes framework, and show that zigzag
codes achieve the optimal rebuilding ratio of $e/r$ for MDS codes, for any
$1\le e\le r$. (ii) We construct systematic codes that achieve optimal
rebuilding ratio of $1/r$, for any systematic or parity node erasure. (iii) We
present error correction algorithms for zigzag codes, and in particular
demonstrate how these codes can be corrected beyond their minimum Hamming
distances.

infections are increasingly used to inform public health authorities on the
level of risk posed by outbreaks. Existing methods to estimate the reproduction
number generally assume exponential growth in case incidence in the first few
disease generations, before susceptible depletion sets in. In reality,
outbreaks can display sub-exponential (i.e., polynomial) growth in the first
few disease generations, owing to clustering in contact patterns, spatial
effects, inhomogeneous mixing, reactive behavior changes, or other mechanisms.
Here, we introduce the generalized growth model to characterize the early
growth profile of outbreaks and estimate the effective reproduction number,
with no need for explicit assumptions about the shape of epidemic growth. We
demonstrate this phenomenologic approach using analytical results and
simulations from mechanistic models, and provide validation against a range of
empirical disease datasets. Our results suggest that sub-exponential growth in
the early phase of an epidemic is the rule rather the exception. For empirical
outbreaks, the generalized-growth model consistently outperforms the
exponential model for a variety of directly and indirectly transmitted diseases
datasets with model estimates supporting sub-exponential growth dynamics. The
rapid decline in effective reproduction number predicted by analytical results
and observed in real and synthetic datasets within 3-5 disease generations
contrasts with the expectation of invariant reproduction number in epidemics
obeying exponential growth. Overall, our approach promotes a more reliable and
data-driven characterization of the early epidemic phase, which is important
for accurate estimation of the reproduction number and prediction of disease
impact.

and energy efficiencies of wireless networks. MIMO has grown beyond the
original point-to-point channel and nowadays refers to a diverse range of
centralized and distributed deployments. The fundamental bottleneck towards
enormous spectral and energy efficiency benefits in multiuser MIMO networks
lies in a huge demand for accurate channel state information at the transmitter
(CSIT). This has become increasingly difficult to satisfy due to the increasing
number of antennas and access points in next generation wireless networks
relying on dense heterogeneous networks and transmitters equipped with a large
number of antennas. CSIT inaccuracy results in a multi-user interference
problem that is the primary bottleneck of MIMO wireless networks. Looking
backward, the problem has been to strive to apply techniques designed for
perfect CSIT to scenarios with imperfect CSIT. In this paper, we depart from
this conventional approach and introduce the readers to a promising strategy
based on rate-splitting. Rate-splitting relies on the transmission of common
and private messages and is shown to provide significant benefits in terms of
spectral and energy efficiencies, reliability and CSI feedback overhead
reduction over conventional strategies used in LTE-A and exclusively relying on
private message transmissions. Open problems, impact on standard specifications

large-scale flow disturbances, strong ascent and large latent heat release. The
causal relationships between these factors are often not obvious, however, and
the roles of different physical processes in producing the extreme
precipitation event can be difficult to disentangle. Here, we examine the
large-scale forcings and convective heating feedback in the precipitation
events which caused the 2010 Pakistan flood within the Column Quasi-Geostrophic
framework. A cloud-revolving model (CRM) is forced with the large-scale
forcings (other than large-scale vertical motion) computed from the
quasi-geostrophic omega equation with input data from a reanalysis data set,
and the large-scale vertical motion is diagnosed interactively with the
simulated convection.
  Numerical results show that the positive feedback of convective heating to
large-scale dynamics is essential in amplifying the precipitation intensity to
the observed values. Orographic lifting is the most important dynamic forcing
in both events, while differential potential vorticity advection also
contributes to the triggering of the first event. Horizontal moisture advection
modulates the extreme events mainly by setting the environmental humidity,
which modulates the amplitude of the convection's response to the dynamic
forcings. When the CRM is replaced by either a single-column model (SCM) with
parameterized convection or a dry model with a reduced effective static
stability, the model results show substantial discrepancies compared with
reanalysis data. The reasons for these discrepancies are examined, and the
implications for global models and theoretical models are discussed.

promising candidates for the direct realization of the emerging quantum
standard of the ampere in the International System of Units. Here, we discuss a
silicon quantum dot single-electron pump with radio frequency control over the
transparencies of entrance and exit barriers as well as the dot potential. We
show that our driving protocol leads to robust bidirectional pumping: one can
conveniently reverse the direction of the quantized current by changing only
the phase shift of one driving waveform with respect to the others. We also
study the improvement in the robustness of the current quantization owing to
the introduction of three control voltages in comparison with the two-waveform
driving. We anticipate that this pumping technique may be used in the future to
perform error counting experiments by pumping the electrons into and out of a
reservoir island monitored by a charge sensor.

high-frequency-peaked BL Lac (HBL) object but also compatible with a pulsar
wind nebula (PWN) nature. Each of these enormously different astronomical
interpretations is supported by some of the observed unusual characteristics.
In order to finally classify and understand this object we took a three-pronged
approach, through time-domain, high angular resolution, and multi-frequency
radio studies. First, our deep time-domain observations with the Arecibo
telescope failed to uncover the putative pulsar powering the proposed PWN. We
conclude with ~70% certainty that HESS J1943+213 does not host a pulsar.
Second, long-baseline interferometry of the source with e-MERLIN at 1.5- and 5-
GHz, shows only a core, a point source at ~ 1 - 100 milli-arcsecond resolution.
Its 2013 flux density is about one-third lower than detected in 2011
observations with similar resolution. This radio variability of the core
strengthens the HBL object hypothesis. More evidence against the PWN scenario
comes, third, from the radio spectrum we compiled. The extended structure
follows a power-law behavior with spectral index alpha = -0.54 +- 0.04 while
the core component is flat spectrum (alpha = -0.03 +- 0.03). In contrast, the
radio synchrotron emission of PWNe predicts a single power-law distribution.
Overall we rule out the PWN hypothesis and conclude the source is a BL Lac
object. The consistently high fraction (70%) of the flux density from the
extended structure then leads us to conclude that HESS J1943+213 must be a
non-classical HBL object.

  with Six Years of Data from the IceCube Detector","Accepted by Astrophysical Journal","Astrophys.J. 826 (2016) no.2, 220","10.3847/0004-637X/826/2/220",,"astro-ph.HE","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The IceCube Neutrino Observatory has accumulated a total of 318 billion
cosmic-ray induced muon events between May 2009 and May 2015. This data set was
used for a detailed analysis of the cosmic-ray arrival direction anisotropy in
the TeV to PeV energy range. The observed global anisotropy features large
regions of relative excess and deficit, with amplitudes on the order of
$10^{-3}$ up to about 100 TeV. A decomposition of the arrival direction
distribution into spherical harmonics shows that most of the power is contained
in the low-multipole ($\ell\leq 4$) moments. However, higher multipole
components are found to be statistically significant down to an angular scale
of less than $10^{\circ}$, approaching the angular resolution of the detector.
Above 100 TeV, a change in the morphology of the arrival direction distribution
is observed, and the anisotropy is characterized by a wide relative deficit
whose amplitude increases with primary energy up to at least 5\,PeV, the
highest energies currently accessible to IceCube. No time dependence of the
large- and small-scale structures is observed in the six-year period covered by
this analysis. The high-statistics data set reveals more details on the
properties of the anisotropy and is potentially able to shed light on the
various physical processes that are responsible for the complex angular
structure and energy evolution.

  (March 3, 2016)",,"10.1093/mnras/stw556",,"astro-ph.EP","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  It has been suggested that hot stellar wind gas in a bow shock around an
exoplanet is sufficiently opaque to absorb stellar photons and give rise to an
observable transit depth at optical and UV wavelengths. In the first part of
this paper, we use the CLOUDY plasma simulation code to model the absorption
from X-ray to radio wavelengths by 1-D slabs of gas in coronal equilibrium with
varying densities ($10^{4}-10^{8} \, {\rm cm^{-3}}$) and temperatures
($2000-10^{6} \ {\rm K}$) illuminated by a solar spectrum. For slabs at coronal
temperatures ($10^{6} \ {\rm K}$) and densities even orders of magnitude larger
than expected for the compressed stellar wind ($10^{4}-10^{5} \, {\rm
cm^{-3}}$), we find optical depths orders of magnitude too small ($>
3\times10^{-7}$) to explain the $\sim3\%$ UV transit depths seen with Hubble.
Using this result and our modeling of slabs with lower temperatures ($2000-10^4
{\rm K}$), the conclusion is that the UV transits of WASP-12b and HD 189733b
are likely due to atoms originating in the planet, as the stellar wind is too
highly ionized. A corollary of this result is that transport of neutral atoms
from the denser planetary atmosphere outward must be a primary consideration
when constructing physical models. In the second part of this paper, additional
calculations using CLOUDY are carried out to model a slab of planetary gas in
radiative and thermal equilibrium with the stellar radiation field. Promising
sources of opacity from the X-ray to radio wavelengths are discussed, some of
which are not yet observed.

break to capture the crisis effect, and we assess the inflation uncertainty
based on a time-varying unobserved component model. In line with recent
empirical studies we discover that in the long-run, the inflation and its
uncertainty negatively impact the stock prices, opposed to the well-known
Fisher effect. In addition we show that for several sector stock indexes the
negative effect of inflation and its uncertainty vanishes after the crisis
setup. However, in the short-run the results provide evidence in the favor of a
negative impact of uncertainty, while the inflation has no significant
influence on stock prices, except for the consumption indexes. The
consideration of business cycle effects confirms our findings, which proves
that the results are robust, both for the long-and the short-run relationships.

counterfeited data synthesised from an out-of-domain dataset, and then fine
tuned on a small set of in-domain utterances with a discriminative objective

achieve competitive performance in terms of BLEU score and slot error rate
while significantly reducing the data needed to train generators in new, unseen

improves generator performance when only a small amount of data is available in
the domain.

play a fundamental role in the evolution of both supermassive black holes

tight SMBH-galaxy relations. A strong support of this ""quasar mode"" feedback
came from the recent X-ray observation of a mildly relativistic accretion disk
wind in a ultraluminous infrared galaxy (ULIRG) and its connection with a
large-scale molecular outflow, providing a direct link between the SMBH and the
gas out of which stars form. Spectroscopic observations, especially in the
X-ray band, show that such accretion disk winds may be common in local AGN and
quasars. However, their origin and characteristics are still not fully
understood. Detailed theoretical models and simulations focused on radiation,
magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) or a combination of these two processes to
investigate the possible acceleration mechanisms and the dynamics of these
winds. Some of these models have been directly compared to X-ray spectra,
providing important insights into the wind physics. However, fundamental
improvements on these studies will come only from the unprecedented energy

the resulting induced charge density, are then computed within density
functional theory, where the free energy is expanded in powers of the density

provides a thermodynamical expression for the fourth moment of charge

defined partial compressibilities. The familiar Stillinger-Lovett condition is
also recovered as a by-product of our method, suggesting that the fourth moment

We determine the atmospheric parameters and differential abundances
using high-resolution ($R \approx 50 000$), high signal-to-noise (S/N $\approx$
110 - 240 per pixel) Keck HIRES spectra for our solar twin candidate, the
previously known solar twin HD 45184, and the Sun.
  Results. For the bright solar twin HD 45184, we found $T_{\rm{eff}} = 5864
\pm 9$ K, log $g = 4.45 \pm 0.03$ dex, $v_{t} = 1.11 \pm 0.02$ $\rm{km\
{s}}^{-1}$, and [Fe/H]$ = 0.04 \pm 0.01$ dex, which are in good agreement with
previous works. The star Inti 1 has atmospheric parameters $T_{\rm{eff}} = 5837
\pm 11$ K, log $g = 4.42 \pm 0.03$ dex, $v_{t} = 1.04 \pm 0.02$ $\rm{km\
{s}}^{-1}$, and [Fe/H]$ = 0.07 \pm 0.01$ dex that are higher than solar. The
age and mass of the solar twin HD 45184 (3 Gyr and 1.05 $\rm{M_{\odot}}$) and
the faint solar twin Inti 1 (4 Gyr and 1.04 $\rm{M_{\odot}}$) were estimated
using isochrones. The differential analysis shows that HD 45184 presents an
abundance pattern that is similar to typical nearby solar twins; this means
this star has an enhanced refractory relative to volatile elements, while Inti
1 has an abundance pattern closer to solar, albeit somewhat enhanced in
refractories. The abundance pattern of HD 45184 and Inti 1 could be reproduced
by adding $\approx 3.5\ \rm{M_{\oplus}}$ and $\approx 1.5\ \rm{M_{\oplus}}$ of
Earth-like material to the convective zone of the Sun.
  Conclusions. The star Inti 1 is a faint solar twin, therefore, it could be
used to calibrate the zero points of different photometric systems. The distant
solar twin Inti 1 has an abundance pattern similar to the Sun with only a minor
enhancement in the refractory elements. It would be important to analyze other
distant solar twins to verify whether they share the Sun's abundance pattern or
if they are enhanced in refractories, as is the case in the majority of nearby
solar twins.

  (2) A southern polarized feature at $\sim$9.6 pc from the core. Its

N-body integrations reveal the stable range of initial eccentricities for
Kepler-62f is $0.00 \leqslant e \leqslant 0.32$, absent the effect of
additional, undetected planets. We simulate the tidal evolution of Kepler-62f
in this range and find that, for certain assumptions, the planet can be locked
in a synchronous rotation state. Simulations using LMD Generic GCM indicate
that with 3 bars of CO$_2$ in its atmosphere, Kepler-62f would only be warm
enough for surface liquid water at the upper limit of this eccentricity range,
providing it has a high planetary obliquity (between 60$^\circ$ and
90$^\circ$). A climate similar to modern-day Earth is possible for the entire
range of stable eccentricities if atmospheric CO$_2$ is increased to 5-bar
levels. In a low-CO$_2$ case, simulations with CCSM4 and LMD Generic GCM
indicate that increases in planetary obliquity and orbital eccentricity coupled
with an orbital configuration that places the summer solstice at or near
pericenter permit regions of the planet with above-freezing surface
temperatures. This may melt ice sheets formed during colder seasons. If
Kepler-62f is synchronously rotating and has an ocean, CO$_2$ levels above 3
bars would be required to distribute enough heat to the night side of the
planet to avoid atmospheric freeze-out and permit a large enough region of open
water at the planet's substellar point to remain stable. Overall, we find
multiple plausible combinations of orbital and atmospheric properties that
permit surface liquid water on Kepler-62f.

under TDiffs -- transverse (volume preserving) diffeomorphisms and global scale
transformations. It is known that these theories can be rewritten in an
equivalent diffeomorphism-invariant form with an action including an
integration constant (cosmological constant for the particular case of
non-scale-invariant unimodular gravity). The presence of this integration
constant, in general, breaks explicitly scale invariance and induces a runaway
potential for the (otherwise massless) dilaton, associated with the determinant
of the metric tensor. We show, however, that if the metric carries mass
dimension $\left[\text{GeV}\right]^{-2}$, the scale invariance of the system is
preserved, unlike the situation in theories in which the metric has mass
dimension different from $-2$. The dilaton remains massless and couples to
other fields only through derivatives, without any conflict with observations.
We observe that one can define a specific limit for fields and their
derivatives (in particular, the dilaton goes to zero, potentially related to
the small distance domain of the theory) in which the only singular terms in
the action correspond to the Higgs mass and the cosmological constant. We
speculate that the self-consistency of the theory may require the regularity of
the action, leading to the absence of the bare Higgs mass and cosmological
constant, whereas their small finite values may be generated by nonperturbative
effects.

with a large, unbiased sample of galaxies extracted from the Sloan Digital Sky
Survey. We confirm earlier work showing that the majority of black hole hosts
have significantly higher velocity dispersions sigma than local galaxies of
similar stellar mass. We use Monte-Carlo simulations to illustrate the effect
on black hole scaling relations if this bias arises from the requirement that
the black hole sphere of influence must be resolved to measure black hole
masses with spatially resolved kinematics. We find that this selection effect
artificially increases the normalization of the Mbh-sigma relation by a factor
of at least ~3; the bias for the Mbh-Mstar relation is even larger. Our Monte
Carlo simulations and analysis of the residuals from scaling relations both
indicate that sigma is more fundamental than Mstar or effective radius. In
particular, the Mbh-Mstar relation is mostly a consequence of the Mbh-sigma and
sigma-Mstar relations, and is heavily biased by up to a factor of 50 at small
masses. This helps resolve the discrepancy between dynamically-based black
hole-galaxy scaling relations versus those of active galaxies. Our simulations
also disfavour broad distributions of black hole masses at fixed sigma.
Correcting for this bias suggests that the calibration factor used to estimate
black hole masses in active galaxies should be reduced to values of fvir~1.
Black hole mass densities should also be proportionally smaller, perhaps
implying significantly higher radiative efficiencies/black hole spins. Reducing
black hole masses also reduces the gravitational wave signal expected from
black hole mergers.

state at late times, $w_{\rm eff} < -1$, but no big-rip future singularity. In
addition to matter and radiation, the braneworld possesses a new effective
degree of freedom - the 'Weyl fluid' or 'dark radiation'. Setting initial
conditions on super-Hubble spatial scales at the epoch of radiation domination,
we evolve perturbations of radiation, pressureless matter and the Weyl fluid
until the present epoch. We observe a gradual decrease in the amplitude of the
Weyl-fluid perturbations after Hubble-radius crossing, which results in a
negligible effect of the Weyl fluid on the evolution of matter perturbations on
spatial scales relevant for structure formation. Consequently, the quasi-static
approximation of Koyama and Maartens provides a good fit to the exact results
during the matter-dominated epoch. We find that the late-time growth of density
perturbations on the brane proceeds at a faster rate than in $\Lambda$CDM.
Additionally, the gravitational potentials $\Phi$ and $\Psi$ evolve differently
on the brane than in $\Lambda$CDM, for which $\Phi = \Psi$. On the brane, by
contrast, the ratio $\Phi/\Psi$ exceeds unity during the late matter-dominated
epoch ($z \lesssim 50$). These features emerge as ""smoking gun"" tests of
phantom brane cosmology and allow predictions of this scenario to be tested

test their hypothesis for the LBVs in M31 and M33 as well as the LMC and SMC.
In M31 and M33, the LBVs are associated with luminous young stars and
supergiants appropriate to their luminosities and positions on the HR Diagram.
Moreover, in the Smith and Tombleson scenario most of the LBVs should be
runaway stars, but the stars' velocities are consistent with their positions in
the respective galaxies. In the Magellanic Clouds, those authors' sample was a
mixed population. We reassess their analysis, removing seven stars that have no
clear relation to LBVs. When we separate the more massive classical and the
less luminous LBVs, the classical LBVs have a distribution similar to the late
O-type stars, while the less luminous LBVs have a distribution like the red
supergiants. None of the confirmed LBVs have high velocities or are candidate
runaway stars. These results support the accepted description of LBVs as

we present a modular invariant symplectic rearrangement of the tree level
non-geometric scalar potential arising from a flux superpotential which
includes the S-dual pairs of non-geometric fluxes $(Q, P)$, the standard NS-NS
and RR three-form fluxes $(F_3, H_3)$ and the geometric flux ($\omega$). This

the complex structure moduli which are implicitly encoded in a set of

potential being explicitly written out in terms of all the real moduli/axions.
Moreover, the final form of the scalar potential needs only the knowledge of
some topological data (such as hodge numbers and the triple intersection
numbers) of the compactifying (CY) threefolds and their respective mirrors.

at high angular resolution to better understand the morphology and physical
structure of the dense gas in Arp~220 and to gain insight into the nature of
the nuclear powering sources. Vibrationally excited emission of HCN is detected
in both nuclei with a very high ratio relative to the total $L_{FIR}$, higher
than in any other observed galaxy and well above what is observed in Galactic
hot cores. HCN $v_2=1f$ is observed to be marginally resolved in
$\sim60\times50$~pc regions inside the dusty $\sim100$~pc sized nuclear cores.
Its emission is centered on our derived individual nuclear velocities based on
HCO$^+$ emission ($V_{WN}=5342\pm4$ and $V_{EN}=5454\pm8$~\kms, for the western
and eastern nucleus, respectively). With virial masses within $r\sim25-30$~pc
based on the HCN~$v_2=1f$ line widths, we estimate gas surface densities (gas
fraction $f_g=0.1$) of $3\pm0.3\times10^4~M_\odot~\rm pc^{-2}$ (WN) and
$1.1\pm0.1\times10^4~M_\odot~\rm pc^{-2}$ (EN). The $4-3/3-2$ flux density
ratio could be consistent with optically thick emission, which would further
constrain the size of the emitting region to $>15$~pc (EN) and $>22$~pc (WN).
The absorption systems that may hide up to $70\%$ of the HCN and HCO$^+$
emission are found at velocities of $-50$~\kms~(EN) and $6$, $-140$, and
$-575$~\kms (WN) relative to velocities of the nuclei. Blueshifted absorptions
are the evidence of outflowing motions from both nuclei. The bright vibrational
emission implies the existence of a hot dust region radiatively pumping these
transitions. We find evidence of a strong temperature gradient that would be
responsible for both the HCN $v_2$ pumping and the absorbed profiles from the
vibrational ground state as a result of both continuum and self-absorption by
cooler foreground gas.

the dimension of the parameter vector of interest to be exponentially larger

be naturally coupled with the margin screening (Fan and Lv 2008) to enhance its
power in sparse testing with a reduced computational cost, or with the
step-down method (Romano and Wolf 2005) to provide a strong control for the
family-wise error rate. In theory, we prove that our simultaneous testing
procedure asymptotically achieves the pre-specified significance level, and
enjoys certain optimality in terms of its power even when the model errors are
non-Gaussian. Our general theory is also useful in studying the support

these deposition hot spots upon chronic radon exposure. The objective of the
present study is to quantify how the induction of basal cell hyperplasia
modulates the microdosimetric consequences of a given radon exposure. For this
purpose, numerical epithelium models were generated with spherical cell nuclei
of six different cell types based on histological data. Basal cell hyperplasia
was modelled by epithelium models with additional basal cells and increased
epithelium thickness. Microdosimetry for alpha-particles was performed by an
own-developed Monte-Carlo code. Results show that the average tissue dose, and
the average hit number and dose of basal cells decrease by the increase of the
measure of hyperplasia. Hit and dose distribution reveal that the induction of
hyperplasia may result in a basal cell pool which is shielded from alpha
radiation. It highlights that the exposure history affects the microdosimetric
consequences of a present exposure, while the biological and health effects may
also depend on previous exposures. The induction of hyperplasia can be
considered as a radioadaptive response at the tissue level. Such an adaptation

scattering in the interface-layer of the junction. Here, we discuss a Josephson
junction consisting of two s-wave superconducting leads coupled over a
classical spin that precesses with the Larmor frequency due to an external
magnetic field. This magnetically active interface results in a time-dependent
boundary condition with different tunnelling amplitudes for spin-up and -down
quasiparticles and where the precession produces spin-flip scattering
processes. As a result, the Andreev states develop sidebands and a
non-equilibrium population that depend on the details of the spin precession.
The Andreev states carry a steady-state Josephson charge current and a
time-dependent spin current, whose current-phase relations could be used for
characterising the precessing spin. The spin current is supported by
spin-triplet correlations induced by the spin precession and creates a
feed-back effect on the classical spin in the form of a torque that shifts the
precession frequency.
  By applying a bias voltage, the Josephson frequency adds another complexity
to the situation and may create resonances together with the Larmor frequency.
These Shapiro resonances are manifested as torques and are, under suitable
conditions, able to reverse the direction of the classical spin in
sub-nanosecond time. Another characteristic feature is the subharmonic gap
structure in the dc charge current displaying an even-odd effect that is
attributable to precession-assisted multiple Andreev reflections.

of spin channels or bands (either spin up or spin down) are conducting and the
opposite ones are insulating. In commented article 1, ZBNNR-BH shows insulating

down electrons. But this crossing of two same spin bands is impossible because
according to well-known Paulis exclusion principle- Two identical fermions

in contracting magnetic islands formed by kinetic reconnection in multi-layered
current sheets. We apply these ideas to sunward-moving flux ropes (2.5D
magnetic islands) formed during fast reconnection in a simulated eruptive
flare. A simple analytic model is used to calculate the energy gain of
particles orbiting the field lines of the contracting magnetic islands in our
ultrahigh-resolution 2.5D numerical simulation. We find that the estimated
energy gains in a single island range up to a factor of five. This is higher
than that found by Drake et al. for islands in the terrestrial magnetosphere
and at the heliopause, due to strong plasma compression that occurs at the
flare current sheet. In order to increase their energy by two orders of
magnitude and plausibly account for the observed high-energy flare emission,
the electrons must visit multiple contracting islands. This mechanism should
produce sporadic emission because island formation is intermittent. Moreover, a
large number of particles could be accelerated in each
magnetohydrodynamic-scale island, which may explain the inferred rates of
energetic-electron production in flares. We conclude that island contraction in
the flare current sheet is a promising candidate for electron acceleration in
solar eruptions.

to experiments which take measurements on single molecules, in which
probabilities of observing particular spin states (rather than ensemble
averages) are of interest. By analogy with standard treatments of the regular
Boltzmann equation, we propose a relaxation-time approximation for the SBE, and
show that solutions to the SBE under the relaxation-time approximation can be
obtained by performing simple trajectory simulations for the case of a boson

can therefore be investigated by careful choice of the parameters for the boson
gas environment, even if the actual environment is quite different from a boson
gas. The application of the SBE approach is demonstrated through an
illustrative example.

between the frequency perceived by an observer who is looking at a moving

flat band (i.e., a local minimum). An observer can see the light diffracted
into a non-specular diffraction order from a multitude of incident light rays
and the angle of incidence of each ray is frequency-dependent, as a
consequence, when the grating is moving, each incident ray experiences a
Doppler shift in frequency that depends on its angle of incidence. We find that
remarkable features appear near a Wood anomaly where the angle of incidence,
for a given diffraction angle, can change very quickly with frequency. This
means that light of multiple frequencies and incident from multiple angles can
be mixed by the motion of the grating into the same diffracted ray and their
frequencies can be compressed into a narrower range. The existence of a flat
band means that a moving grating can be used as a device to increase the
intensity of the perceived diffracted light due to spectral compression. The
properties of a grating in motion in sunlight can also be relevant to the study
of naturally occurring gratings which are typically in oscillatory motion.

lays the groundwork for a new approach to geo-privacy of social images: Instead
of requiring a complete change of user behavior, we investigate the protection

reversal processing (PTRP) can effectively reduce the channel time dispersion
in a simple way via convolving the received packet with a time reversed probe
signal. However the probe signal itself may introduce extra noise and
interference (self-correlation of the probe signal). In this paper, we propose
a virtual time reversal processing (VTRP) for single input single output (SISO)
Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM) systems. It convolves the
received packet with the reversed estimated channel, instead of the probe
signal to reduce the interference. Two sparse channel estimation methods,
matching pursuit (MP), and basis pursuit de-noising (BPDN), are adopted to
estimate the channel impulse response (CIR). We compare the performance of VTRP
with the PTRP and without any time reversal processing through MATLAB
simulations and the pool experiments. The results reveal that VTRP has
outstanding performance over time-invariant channels.

effect of the opening of the Hong Kong Shanghai Connect that links the stock
exchanges in the two cities, arguably the biggest event in international
business and finance since Christopher Columbus set sail for India. We design a
novel methodology that compensates for the lack of data on trading costs in
China. We estimate trading costs across similar positions on the dual listed
set of securities in Hong Kong and China, hoping to provide useful pieces of
information to help scale 'The Great Wall of Chinese Securities Trading Costs'.
We then compare actual and estimated trading costs on a sample of real orders
across the Hong Kong securities in the dual listed pair to establish the
accuracy of our measurements. The primary question we seek to address is 'Which
market would be better to trade to gain exposure to the same (or similar) set
of securities or sectors?' We find that trading costs on Shanghai, which might
have been lower than Hong Kong, might have become higher leading up to the
Connect. What remains to be seen is whether this increase in trading costs is a
temporary equilibrium due to the frenzy to gain exposure to Chinese securities
or whether this phenomenon will persist once the two markets start becoming
more and more tightly coupled. It would be interesting to see if this
pioneering policy will lead to securities exchanges across the globe linking up
one another, creating a trade anything, anywhere and anytime marketplace.
Looking beyond mere trading costs, such studies can be used to gather some
evidence on what effect the mode of governance and other aspects of life in one
country have on another country, once they start joining up their financial
markets.

hull by $\Pi$. We prove a number of inclusion-exclusion identities for the
system of convex hulls $\Pi_I:=conv(X_i\colon i\in I)$, where $I$ ranges over
all subsets of $\{1,\ldots,n\}$. For instance, denoting by $c_k(X)$ the number
of $k$-element subcollections of $(X_1,\ldots,X_n)$ whose convex hull contains
a point $X\in\mathbb R^d$, we prove that $$ c_1(X)-c_2(X)+c_3(X)-\ldots +
(-1)^{n-1} c_n(X) = (-1)^{\dim \Pi} $$ for all $X$ in the relative interior of
$\Pi$. This confirms a conjecture of R. Cowan [Adv. Appl. Probab.,
39(3):630--644, 2007] who proved the above formula for almost all $X$. We
establish similar results for the number of polytopes $\Pi_J$ containing a
given polytope $\Pi_I$ as an $r$-dimensional face, thus proving another
conjecture of R. Cowan [Discrete Comput. Geom., 43(2):209--220, 2010]. As a
consequence, we derive inclusion-exclusion identities for the intrinsic volumes
and the face numbers of the polytopes $\Pi_I$. The main tool in our proofs is a
formula for the alternating sum of the face numbers of a convex polytope
intersected by an affine subspace. This formula generalizes the classical
Euler--Schl\""afli--Poincar\'e relation and is of independent interest.

multiple visual views, which can be in the forms of bag-of-words (counts) or
color/texture histograms (real-valued). At the same time, the image may have
several social tags, which are best described using a sparse binary vector. Our
deep model takes as input multiple type-specific features, narrows the
cross-modality semantic gaps, learns cross-type correlation, and produces a
high-level homogeneous representation. At the same time, the model supports
heterogeneously typed tasks. We demonstrate the capacity of the model on two

are often characterized by the presence of peripheral ring-like structures,
where the excitation is initialized, and inner reaction centers (RC), where the
excitation is trapped. The peripheral rings display coherent features: their
eigenstates can be separated in the two classes of superradiant and subradiant
states. Both are important to optimize transfer efficiency. In the absence of
disorder, superradiant states have an enhanced coupling strength to the RC,
while the subradiant ones are basically decoupled from it. Static on-site
disorder induces a coupling between subradiant and superradiant states,
creating an indirect coupling to the RC. The problem of finding the optimal
transfer conditions, as a function of both the RC energy and the disorder
strength, is very complex even in the simplest network, namely a three-level
system. In this paper we analyze such trimeric structure choosing as initial
condition a subradiant state, rather than the more common choice of an
excitation localized on a site. We show that, while the optimal disorder is of
the order of the superradiant coupling, the optimal detuning between the
initial state and the RC energy strongly depends on system parameters: when the
superradiant coupling is much larger than the energy gap between the
superradiant and the subradiant levels, optimal transfer occurs if the RC
energy is at resonance with the subradiant initial state, whereas we find an
optimal RC energy at resonance with a virtual dressed state when the
superradiant coupling is smaller than or comparable with the gap. The presence
of dynamical noise, which induces dephasing and decoherence, affects the
resonance structure of energy transfer producing an additional 'incoherent'
resonance peak, which corresponds to the RC energy being equal to the energy of
the superradiant state.

all similar to the original shape. An $r$-reptiling is an $r$-gentiling of
which all parts are mutually congruent. By applying gentilings recursively,
together with a rule that defines an order on the parts, one may obtain an
order in which to traverse all points within the original shape. We say such a
traversal is a face-continuous space-filling curve if, at any level of
recursion, the interior of the union of any set of consecutive parts is
connected---that is, consecutive parts must always meet along an edge. Most
famously, the isosceles right triangle admits a 2-reptiling, which forms the
basis of the face-continuous Sierpinski space-filling curve; many other right
triangles admit reptilings and gentilings that yield face-continuous
space-filling curves as well. In this study we investigate what acute triangles
admit non-trivial reptilings and gentilings, and whether these can form the
basis for face-continuous space-filling curves. We derive several properties of
reptilings and gentilings of acute (sometimes also obtuse) triangles, leading
to the following conclusion: no face-continuous space-filling curve can be
constructed on the basis of reptilings of acute triangles.

sequential specification. However, when used \emph{as is}, a nontrivial
sequential data structure, such as a linked list, a search tree, or a hash
table, may expose incorrect behavior: lost updates, inconsistent responses,
etc. To ensure correctness, portions of the sequential code operating on the
shared data must be ""protected"" from data races using synchronization
primitives and, thus, certain schedules of the steps of concurrent operations
must be rejected. But can we ensure that we do not ""overuse"" synchronization,
i.e., that we reject a concurrent schedule only if it violates correctness?
  In this paper, we treat this question formally by introducing the notion of a
\emph{concurrency-optimal} implementation. A program's concurrency is defined
here as its ability to accept concurrent schedules, i.e., interleavings of
steps of its sequential implementation. An implementation is
concurrency-optimal if it accepts all interleavings that do not violate the
program's correctness. We explore the concurrency properties of \emph{search}
data structures which can be represented in the form of directed acyclic graphs
exporting insert, delete and search operations. We prove, for the first time,
that \emph{pessimistic} e.g., based on conservative locking) and
\emph{optimistic serializable} e.g., based on serializable transactional
memory) implementations of search data-structures are incomparable in terms of
concurrency. Specifically, there exist simple interleavings of sequential code
that cannot be accepted by \emph{any} pessimistic (and \emph{resp.},
serializable optimistic) implementation, but accepted by a serializable
optimistic one (and \emph{resp.}, pessimistic). Thus, neither of these two
implementation classes is concurrency-optimal.

in the generation of chaos. However, so far, most of the attention has been on
moving nodes; little is known about the possibility of chaos in the case of
stationary nodes. We address this question by considering stationary states,
which provide the simplest examples of wave functions with stationary nodes. We
provide examples of stationary wave functions for which there is chaos, as
demonstrated by numerical computations, for one particle moving in 3 spatial
dimensions and for two and three entangled particles in two dimensions. Our
conclusion is that the motion of the nodes is not necessary for the generation
of chaos. What is important is the overall complexity of the wave function.
That is, if the wave function, or rather its phase, has complex spatial
variations, it will lead to complex Bohmian trajectories and hence to chaos.
Another aspect of our work concerns the average Lyapunov exponent, which
quantifies the overall amount of chaos. Since it is very hard to evaluate the
average Lyapunov exponent analytically, which is often computed numerically, it
is useful to have simple quantities that agree well with the average Lyapunov
exponent. We investigate possible correlations with quantities such as the
participation ratio and different measures of entanglement, for different
systems and different families of stationary wave functions. We find that these
quantities often tend to correlate to the amount of chaos. However, the
correlation is not perfect, because, in particular, these measures do not
depend on the form of the basis states used to expand the wave function, while
the amount of chaos does.

operations into $2\gamma$ operation so that some partial sums of these
operations are associative. We provide a complete study of the

possible deviation from ionization equilibrium. Fitting with a single
temperature collisional non-equilibrium plasma model shows that the electron
temperature increases from the southeast to the northwest. The ionization
parameter is consistent with that in equilibrium (n_et>10^{13} s cm^{-3})
except for a specific region with the highest temperature
(kT=13.3^{+1.4}_{-1.1} keV) where n_et=10^{11.6^{+0.6}_{-1.7}} s cm^{-3}. The
elapsed time from the plasma heating estimated from the ionization parameter is
0.36-76 Myr at the 90% confidence level. This time scale is quite short but
consistent with the traveling time of a shock to pass through that region. We
thus interpret that the non-equilibrium ionization plasma in Abell 754 observed
is a remnant of the shock heating in the merger process. We, however, note that
the X-ray spectrum of the specific region where the non-equilibrium is found
can also be fitted with a collisional ionization plasma model with two
temperatures, low kT=4.2^{+4.2}_{-1.5} keV and very high kT > 19.3 keV. The
very high temperature component is alternatively fitted with a power law model.

shocks ahead compress and reconnect with the Earth's magnetic field. The
transit times and impacts in detail depend on the initial CME velocity, size,
and mass, as well as on the conditions and coupling processes with the ambient
solar wind flow in interplanetary space. The observed CME parameters may be
severly affected by projection effects and the constant changing environmental
conditions are hard to derive. This makes it difficult to fully understand the
physics behind CME evolution, preventing to do a reliable forecast of
Earth-directed events. This short review focusing on observational data, shows
recent methods which were developed to derive the CME kinematical profile for
the entire Sun-Earth distance range as well as studies which were performed to
shed light on the physical processes that CMEs encounter when propagating from
Sun to Earth.

broken $U(1)$ symmetry by parametrizing the bosonic Baym-Kadanoff effective
action in terms of one- and two-point self-energies. The formalism goes beyond
other approximate methods such as the pseudoparticle variational cluster
approximation, the cluster composite boson mapping, and the Bogoliubov+U
theory. It simplifies to bosonic dynamical-mean field theory when constraining
to local fields, whereas when neglecting kinetic contributions of non-condensed
bosons it reduces to the static mean-field approximation. To benchmark the
theory we study the Bose-Hubbard model on the two- and three-dimensional cubic
lattice, comparing with exact results from path integral quantum Monte Carlo.
We also study the frustrated square lattice with next-nearest neighbor hopping,
which is beyond the reach of Monte Carlo simulations. A reference system
comprising a single bosonic state, corresponding to three variational
parameters, is sufficient to quantitatively describe phase-boundaries, and
thermodynamical observables, while qualitatively capturing the spectral
functions, as well as the enhancement of kinetic fluctuations in the frustrated
case. On the basis of these findings we propose self-energy functional theory
as the omnibus framework for treating bosonic lattice models, in particular, in
cases where path integral quantum Monte Carlo methods suffer from severe sign
problems (e.g. in the presence of non-trivial gauge fields or frustration).
Self-energy functional theory enables the construction of diagrammatically
sound approximations that are quantitatively precise and controlled in the
number of optimization parameters, but nevertheless remain computable by modest

candidate of a formation mechanism of binary stars, brown dwarfs, and gaseous

disk cooling timescale is comparable to its dynamical timescale. However, some
numerical simulations suggest that the fragmentation does not occur even if the
cooling time is small enough, or the fragmentation can occur even when the
cooling is inefficient. To reveal a realistic condition for fragmentation of
self-gravitating disks, we perform two-dimensional numerical simulations that
take into account the effect of the irradiation of the central star and
radiation cooling of the disk, and precisely investigate the structure of the
spiral arms formed in the protoplanetary disks. We show that the Toomre Q
parameter in the spiral arms is an essential parameter for fragmentation. The
spiral arms fragment only when Q < 0.6 in the spiral arms. We have further
confirmed that this fragmentation condition observed in the numerical
simulations can be obtained from the linear stability analysis for the
self-gravitating spiral arms. These results indicate that the process of
fragmentation of protoplanetary disks is divided into two stages: formation of
the spiral arms in the disks; and fragmentation of the spiral arm. Our work
reduces the condition for the fragmentation of the protoplanetary disks to the
condition of the formation of the spiral arm that satisfies Q < 0.6.

the vaccination behavior is effective in heterogeneous networks more than in

explained by the nonballistic helical motion of the emitting material. The cor-
relation analysis suggested that the variabilities of radio 15 GHz, X-ray and
0-ray are remarkable correlated, and the emission of radio 15 GHz lags behind
that of X-ray, and the X-ray flux lags behind the gamma-ray. This suggests that
the gamma-ray derives from inverse Compton (IC) scattering of the synchrotron

motivated by mining and agricultural scenarios where a dedicated replenishment
agent transports a resource between a centralised replenishment point to agents
using the resource in the field. The agents in the field typically operate
within fixed areas (for example, benches in mining applications, and fields or
orchards in agricultural scenarios), and the motion of the replenishment agent
may be restricted by a road network. Existing research has typically approached
the problem of scheduling the actions of the dedicated replenishment agent from
a short-term and deterministic angle. This paper introduces a method of
incorporating uncertainty in the schedule optimisation through a novel
prediction framework, and a branch and bound optimisation method which uses the
prediction framework to minimise the downtime of the agents. The prediction
framework makes use of several Gaussian approximations to quickly calculate the
risk-weighted cost of a schedule. The anytime nature of the branch and bound
method is exploited within an MPC-like framework to outperform existing
optimisation methods while providing reasonable calculation times in large

to multicast two different messages, each of them to a different set of users.
In addition, one of the transmitters --commonly referred to as the cognitive
transmitter-- has prior non-causal knowledge of both messages to be
transmitted. This scenario combines difficulties and challenges arising in the
Interference Channel, the Broadcast Channel and multicasting communications.
Our aim concerns the derivation of optimal interference mitigation techniques
in such a challenging communication setup. We investigate to this end the
multi-primary CIFC and its dual multi-secondary CIFC under various interference
regimes as an attempt to build a thorough understanding for the more general
setting. It is shown that, for some regimes, well-known coding techniques for
the conventional CIFC remain still optimal in the presence of multicasting.
While in other regimes, evolved encoding and/or decoding strategies are
crucial. A careful use of these coding schemes and new outer bounding
techniques allows us to characterize the capacity region for several classes of
discrete memoryless and Gaussian channels in different interference regimes.

non-parametric estimator of a non-simplified vine copula that allows for
varying conditional copulas using penalized hierarchical B-splines. Throughout
the vine copula, we test for the simplifying assumption in each edge,
establishing a data-driven non-simplified vine copula estimator. To overcome
the curse of dimensionality, we approximate conditional copulas with more than
one conditioning argument by a conditional copula with the first principal

showing a substantial improvement in the out-of-sample Kullback-Leibler

error in the local density approximation (LDA) and generalized gradient
approximations (GGA), and the difficulty of using asymptotically long-ranged
potentials for surface calculations. An approximate optimize effective
potential (OEP), the Becke-Johnson'06 exchange, is used to explore the
capability of OEP to calculate semiconductor IP with a surface technique
suitable for both short- and long-ranged potentials. Combined with the LDA
correlation, the approximate OEP has achieved an IP accuracy for 17
semiconductors which is similar to the much more sophisticated $GW$
approximation (GWA), with the computational cost of only LDA/GGA. For the first
time, this opens the way for systematic calculation of semiconductor IP's by
the DFT-Kohn-Sham scheme. The long-range part of the $v_{xc}$ is not as
important for solid surface as for atoms and molecules since the wave functions
are mainly bound to the slab while less exposed to the asymptotic region.
Nevertheless, it contributes significantly to the total IP and therefore shall
not be simply ignored. Without including its effects, it is unlikely that the
same GWA procedure could achieve universally accurate band gaps and accurate
IP's at the same time, as is indeed seen in practical calculations.

during initial training epochs). Also, BN cannot be used with batch-size 1

normalization technique for removing internal covariate shift, that we call
Normalization Propagation. Our approach does not depend on batch statistics,
but rather uses a data-independent parametric estimate of mean and
standard-deviation in every layer thus being computationally faster compared
with BN. We exploit the observation that the pre-activation before Rectified
Linear Units follow Gaussian distribution in deep networks, and that once the
first and second order statistics of any given dataset are normalized, we can
forward propagate this normalization without the need for recalculating the
approximate statistics for hidden layers.

when the dynamic relaxation and polarization are included within the Dyson

complex ""shape-Feschbach"" nature in the open p-shell reveals itself as a
prominent resonance structure in the photodetachment cross sections in the

confinement along all the three dimensions of the k-space. We apply it to
diamond nanoparticles of sub-50nm size, a system with pronounced anisotropy of
dispersion for which the use of three-dimensional dispersion is a requisite.
The model excellently reproduces size-sensitive spectral features, including
the peak position, bandwidth and asymmetry of the sp3 C-C Raman band. This
fundamental approach can be easily generalized to other nanocrystalline solids

We acquired low-resolution spectropolarimetric observations with the ESO FORS2
instrument during two different observing runs. During the first run in visitor
mode, we observed the LMC Wolf-Rayet star BAT99 7 and the stars WR6, WR7, WR18,
and WR23 in our Galaxy. The second run in service mode was focused on
monitoring the star WR6. Linear polarization was recorded immediately after the
observations of circular polarization. During our visitor observing run, the
magnetic field for the cyclically variable star WR6 was measured at a
significance level of 3.3sigma (<B_z> = 258+-78G). Among the other targets, the
highest value for the longitudinal magnetic field, <B_z> = 327+-141G, was
measured in the LMC star BAT99 7. Spectropolarimetric monitoring of the star
WR6 revealed a sinusoidal nature of the <B_z> variations with the known
rotation period of 3.77d, significantly adding to the confidence in the
detection. The presence of the rotation-modulated magnetic variability is also
indicated in our frequency periodogram. The reported field magnitude suffers
from significant systematic uncertainties at the factor 2 level, in addition to
the quoted statistical uncertainties, owing to the theoretical approach used to
characterize it. Linear polarization measurements showed no line effect in the
stars, apart from WR6. BAT99 7, WR7, and WR,23 do not show variability of the
linear polarization over two nights.

the sender, but it is unknown to the agents. The sender is allowed to commit to
a signaling policy where she sends a private signal---say, a viral marketing

signaling policy that maximizes the sender's revenue.
  We show that if the sender's utility is a submodular function of the set of
agents that adopt the product, then we can efficiently find a signaling policy
whose revenue is at least (1-1/e) times the optimal. We also prove that
approximating the sender's optimal revenue by a factor better than (1-1/e) is
NP-hard and, hence, the developed approximation guarantee is essentially tight.
When the senders' utility is a function of the number of agents that adopt the

an interesting connection between the Bayesian persuasion problem and the

from the 900 ksec Chandra observation to radiative transfer computations in
pressure equilibrium using the radiative transfer code TITAN. We explore
different values of the ionization parameter xi of the incident flux and adjust
the hydrogen-equivalent column density, N_H0 of the warm absorber to match the
observed soft X-ray continuum. We derive theoretical column densities for a
broad range of ionic species of iron and neon and an AMD that we compare to the
observations. We find an extension of the degeneracy between xi and N_H0 for
the constant pressure models previously discussed for NGC 3783. Including the
ionic column densities of iron and neon in the comparison between observations
and data we conclude that a range of ionization parameters between 4000 and
8000 ergs cm/s is preferred. For the first time, we present theoretical AMD for
a constant pressure wind in NGC 3783 that correctly reproduces the observed

instability region. Using a variety of observational indicators, we confirm
that the X-ray outflow of NGC 3783 can be described as an RPC medium in

uniformly cold thermal state. The measured ionic column densities suggest that
the wind tends to the uniformly cold thermal state. The occurrence of thermal

  Transactions on Information Theory, Dec. 2015, paper IT-15-1104",,,,"cs.IT math.IT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We consider non-binary product codes with MDS components and their iterative
row-column algebraic decoding on the erasure channel. Both independent and
block erasures are considered in this paper. A compact graph representation is
introduced on which we define double-diversity edge colorings via the rootcheck
concept. An upper bound of the number of decoding iterations is given as a
function of the graph size and the color palette size $M$. Stopping sets are
defined in the context of MDS components and a relationship is established with
the graph representation. A full characterization of these stopping sets is
given up to a size $(d_1+1)(d_2+1)$, where $d_1$ and $d_2$ are the minimum
Hamming distances of the column and row MDS components respectively. Then, we
propose a differential evolution edge coloring algorithm that produces
colorings with a large population of minimal rootcheck order symbols. The
complexity of this algorithm per iteration is $o(M^{\aleph})$, for a given
differential evolution parameter $\aleph$, where $M^{\aleph}$ itself is small
with respect to the huge cardinality of the coloring ensemble. The performance
of MDS-based product codes with and without double-diversity coloring is
analyzed in presence of both block and independent erasures. In the latter
case, ML and iterative decoding are proven to coincide at small channel erasure
probability. Furthermore, numerical results show excellent performance in
presence of unequal erasure probability due to double-diversity colorings.

The observation was made during an extended and bright soft state in June,
2015. An extremely rich disk wind absorption spectrum is detected, similar to
that observed at lower sensitivity in 2007. The very high resolution of the
third-order spectrum reveals four components to the disk wind in the Fe K band
alone; the fastest has a blue-shift of v = 0.03c. Broadened re-emission from
the wind is also detected in the first-order spectrum, giving rise to clear
accretion disk P Cygni profiles. Dynamical modeling of the re-emission spectrum
gives wind launching radii of r ~ 10^(2-4) GM/c^2. Wind density values of n ~
10^(13-16) cm^-3 are then required by the ionization parameter formalism. The
small launching radii, high density values, and inferred high mass outflow
rates signal a role for magnetic driving. With simple, reasonable assumptions,
the wind properties constrain the magnitude of the emergent magnetic field to B
~ 10^(3-4) Gauss if the wind is driven via magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) pressure
from within the disk, and B ~ 10^(4-5) Gauss if the wind is driven by
magnetocentrifugal acceleration. The MHD estimates are below upper limits
predicted by the canonical alpha-disk model (Shakura & Sunyaev 1973). We
discuss these results in terms of fundamental disk physics and black hole

the dependence structure modeled by a vine copula is estimated via likelihood

the copula likelihood expression such that numerical integration is needed for
its evaluation. For the dependence modeling a sequential estimation approach
that facilitates the computational challenges of the likelihood optimization is
provided. A three-dimensional simulation study provides evidence for the good

front, with about 1% of the total energy going into the magnetic field for a

lower mass ratios show significant fields much further downstream than in the

and emission in gamma-ray bursts, among other relativistic astrophysical
outflows, but also underscores the necessity of optimizing numerical and

accessible by conventional probes. Here using FeSe as a model system, and
symmetry resolved electronic Raman scattering as a probe, we unravel the
presence of critical charge nematic fluctuations near the structural / nematic

between the observed nematic susceptibility and elastic modulus data

polyhedra, in the form of alternating dodecahedra and icosahedra that are
self-similarly scaled. This particular choice allows the possibility of forming
triangles using only discretized wave-vectors when the scaling between two
consecutive dodecahedra is equal to the golden ratio, and the icosahedron
between the two dodecahedra is the dual of the inner dodecahedron.
Alternatively, the same discretization can be described as a logarithmically
spaced (with a scaling equal to the golden ratio), nested
dodecahedron-icosahedron compounds. A wave-vector which points from the origin
to a vertex of such a mesh, can always find two other discretized wave-vectors
that are also on the vertices of the mesh (which is not true for an arbitrary
mesh). Thus, the nested polyhedra grid can be thought of as a reduction (or
decimation) of the Fourier space using a particular set of self-similar triads
aranged approximately in a spherical form. For each vertex (i.e. discretized
wave-vector) in this space, there are either 9 or 15 pairs of vertices (i.e.
wave-vectors) with which the initial vertex can interact to form a triangle.
This allows the reduction of the convolution integral in the Navier-Stokes
equation to a sum over 9 or 15 interaction pairs. Transforming the equation in
Fourier space, to a network of interacting nodes, that can be constructed as a
numerical model, which evolves each component of the velocity vector on each
node of the network. Such a model gives the usual Kolmogorov spectrum. Since
the scaling is logarithmic, and the number of nodes for each scale is constant,
a very large inertial range can be considered with a much lower number of
degrees of freedom. Incidentally, by assuming isotropy and a certain relation
between the phases, the model can be used to systematically derive three
dimensional shell models.

today---whether explicitly articulated, or deduced from biological or
behavioral connections---pose new issues around privacy guarantees, because of
inferences that can be made about one individual from another's data. This
motivates quantifying privacy in networked contexts in terms of ""inferential
privacy""---which measures the change in beliefs about an individual's data from
the result of a computation---as originally proposed by Dalenius in the 1970's.
Inferential privacy is implied by differential privacy when data are
independent, but can be much worse when data are correlated; indeed, simple
examples, as well as a general impossibility theorem of Dwork and Naor,
preclude the possibility of achieving non-trivial inferential privacy when the
adversary can have arbitrary auxiliary information. In this paper, we ask how
differential privacy guarantees translate to guarantees on inferential privacy
in networked contexts: specifically, under what limitations on the adversary's
information about correlations, modeled as a prior distribution over datasets,
can we deduce an inferential guarantee from a differential one?
  We prove two main results. The first result pertains to distributions that
satisfy a natural positive-affiliation condition, and gives an upper bound on
the inferential privacy guarantee for any differentially private mechanism.
This upper bound is matched by a simple mechanism that adds Laplace noise to
the sum of the data. The second result pertains to distributions that have weak
correlations, defined in terms of a suitable ""influence matrix"". The result
provides an upper bound for inferential privacy in terms of the differential
privacy parameter and the spectral norm of this matrix.

online claims. The resulting information cascades contain instances of both
accurate and inaccurate information, unfold over multiple time scales, and
often reach audiences of considerable size. All these factors pose challenges
for the study of the social dynamics of online news sharing. Here we introduce
Hoaxy, a platform for the collection, detection, and analysis of online
misinformation and its related fact-checking efforts. We discuss the design of
the platform and present a preliminary analysis of a sample of public tweets
containing both fake news and fact checking. We find that, in the aggregate,
the sharing of fact-checking content typically lags that of misinformation by
10--20 hours. Moreover, fake news are dominated by very active users, while
fact checking is a more grass-roots activity. With the increasing risks
connected to massive online misinformation, social news observatories have the
potential to help researchers, journalists, and the general public understand
the dynamics of real and fake news sharing.

19410+2336 have revealed strong outflow activity with several interacting
outflows. We aim to get a better understanding of the outflow activity in this
region by observing the SiO and H$^{13}$CO$^+$ emission with high angular
resolution. SiO is known to trace shocked gas, which is often associated with
young energetic outflows. With the H$^{13}$CO$^+$ data, we intend to better
understand the distribution of the quiescent gaseous component of the region.
Methods: The SiO observations in the J=2-1 v=0 transition and H$^{13}$CO$^+$
J=1-0 observations were performed by the Plateau de Bure Interferometer,
combined with IRAM 30 m single-dish observations, in order to get the missing
short-spacing information. We complement this new high-resolution observation
with earlier CO and H$_2$ data. Results: The SiO observations do not trace the
previously in CO and H$_2$ identified outflows well. Although we identify
regions of highly increased SiO abundance indicative of shock interaction,
there are hardly any bipolar structures in the data. The southern part of the
region, which exhibits strong H$_2$ emission, shows almost no SiO. The CO and
SiO data show only weak similarities, and the main SiO emission lies between
the two dominating dust clumps of the region. Conclusions: Most SiO emission is
likely to be a result of high-velocity shocks due to protostellar jets.
However, this does not explain all the emission features and additional
effects; for example, colliding gas flows at the interface of the two main
regions may play an important role in the origin of the emission. The present
SiO data show that several different effects can influence SiO emission, which
makes the interpretation of SiO data more difficult than often assumed.

energy from natural motion sources such as walking, waves, trees etc, into
electrical energy. A DEG is comprised of a soft and flexible Dielectric
Elastomer capacitor (DE), a Priming Circuit (PC), which transfers high
potential charge onto/off the DE electrodes, and a power extraction circuit
which harvests the generated power. To generate power, the PC must charge and
discharge the DE in synchronization with the DE's capacitance change. A simple
circuit to do this exists: the self-priming circuit (SPC). The SPC consists of
diodes and capacitors which passively switch between charge delivery and charge
receiving states in synchronization with the DE's capacitance change. Until now
there has been no understanding of how to design a SPC in order to maximize
harvested energy from the dielectric elastomer (DE). A new mathematical model
for a SPC is presented, leading to design and optimization. An accuracy of 0.1%
between model, simulation and experiment is obtained once losses are taken into
consideration. The behavior of the SPC is shown to be related to the maximum
and minimum capacitance's of the DE, but is largley unaffected by the exact

June 12-13, 2014. In summary we find that nuclear astrophysics is a modern and
vibrant field addressing fundamental science questions at the intersection of
nuclear physics and astrophysics. These questions relate to the origin of the
elements, the nuclear engines that drive life and death of stars, and the
properties of dense matter. A broad range of nuclear accelerator facilities,

velocity boundary conditions on an immersed body. These surface stresses may
contain spurious oscillations that make them ill-suited for representing the
physical surface stresses on the body. Moreover, these inaccurate stresses
often lead to unphysical oscillations in the history of integrated surface
forces such as the coefficient of lift. While the errors in the surface
stresses and forces do not necessarily affect the convergence of the velocity
field, it is desirable, especially in fluid-structure interaction problems, to
obtain smooth and convergent stress distributions on the surface. To this end,
we show that the equation for the surface stresses is an integral equation of
the first kind whose ill-posedness is the source of spurious oscillations in
the stresses. We also demonstrate that for sufficiently smooth delta functions,
the oscillations may be filtered out to obtain physically accurate surface
stresses. The filtering is applied as a post-processing procedure, so that the
convergence of the velocity field is unaffected. We demonstrate the efficacy of
the method by computing stresses and forces that converge to the physical
stresses and forces for several test problems.

massive MIMO system. The proposed channel model is evolved from correlation
based stochastic channel model (CBSCM) but in addition to the properties of
CBSCM, it has capability of capturing channel variations along time or
frequency and along space simultaneously. It has a simplified analytical
expression, still being able to simulate underlying physical phenomena which
otherwise need a complex geometry based stochastic channel model (GBSCM). The
channel model is verified with reported measurement data of channel for massive
MIMO. Spatial determinism in channel, the basic cause of unfavorable
propagation, is modeled into controlling parameters of channel model. Channel
model uses only three controlling parameters; one parameter describes variation
in channel along resource block (along time or frequency) and remaining two
parameters describe spatial variation in channel. Modeling of simultaneous
variation along time and space belongs to a very common scenario where mobility
of mobile terminal and angular power distribution at base station receiver, are
key parameters. Additionally, simulation results reveal the hidden advantages
of spatial determinism in channel for multiuser massive MIMO.
