distribution of point variations, whose parameters are estimated from example
shapes. Principal component analysis (PCA) is applied to obtain a
low-dimensional representation of the shape variation in terms of the leading
principal components. In this paper, we propose a generalization of SSMs,
called Gaussian Process Morphable Models (GPMMs). We model the shape variations
with a Gaussian process, which we represent using the leading components of its
Karhunen-Loeve expansion. To compute the expansion, we make use of an
approximation scheme based on the Nystrom method. The resulting model can be
seen as a continuous analogon of an SSM. However, while for SSMs the shape
variation is restricted to the span of the example data, with GPMMs we can
define the shape variation using any Gaussian process. For example, we can
build shape models that correspond to classical spline models, and thus do not
require any example data. Furthermore, Gaussian processes make it possible to
combine different models. For example, an SSM can be extended with a spline
model, to obtain a model that incorporates learned shape characteristics, but
is flexible enough to explain shapes that cannot be represented by the SSM. We
introduce a simple algorithm for fitting a GPMM to a surface or image. This
results in a non-rigid registration approach, whose regularization properties
are defined by a GPMM. We show how we can obtain different registration
schemes,including methods for multi-scale, spatially-varying or hybrid
registration, by constructing an appropriate GPMM. As our approach strictly
separates modelling from the fitting process, this is all achieved without
changes to the fitting algorithm. We show the applicability and versatility of
GPMMs on a clinical use case, where the goal is the model-based segmentation of
3D forearm images.

have resulted in more than 4000 Young Stellar Objects (YSOs). Using color
criteria we have selected a sample of ~150 candidates, and an additional 40
candidates and known transition disks from the literature. The Spitzer data
were complemented by new observations at longer wavelengths, including new JCMT
and APEX submillimeter photometry, and WISE and Herschel-PACS mid and
far-infrared photometry. Furthermore, optical spectroscopy was obtained and
stellar types were derived for 85% of the sample, including information from
the literature. The SEDs were fit to a grid of RADMC-3D disk models with a
limited number of parameters: disk mass, inner disk mass, scale height and
flaring, and disk cavity radius, where the latter is the main parameter of
interest. A large fraction of the targets possibly have dust cavities based on
the SED. The derived cavity sizes are consistent with imaging/modeling results
in the literature, where available. Trends are found with Ldisk/Lstar and
stellar mass and a possible connection with exoplanet orbital radii. A
comparison with a previous study where color observables are used (Cieza et al.

our transition disks with cavities. A large number of the new transition disk

heavy doping with Sn, is suggested as an effective way of reaching the resonant

reason for an earlier unsuccessful experimental observation of the influence of
the RL on thermoelectric properties of Sn doped Bi$_2$Te$_2$Se. Finally we

formalism. We find the analytical solutions for the radial profiles of
velocity, specific angular momentum and specific energy of the circular orbits

existence of toroidal charged particle epicyclic motion with $\omega_\mir \sim

significant non-thermal particle signatures with a low, if any, thermal
emission, that implies close association of the observed emission with the
primary energy release/electron acceleration region. This paper presents a
flare that appears a ""cold"" one at the impulsive phase, while displaying a
delayed heating later on. Using HXR data from \kw, microwave observations by
SSRT, RSTN, NoRH and NoRP, context observations, and 3D modeling, we study the
energy release, particle acceleration and transport, and the relationships
between the nonthermal and thermal signatures. The flaring process is found to
involve interaction between a small and a big loop and the accelerated
particles divided in roughly equal numbers between them. Precipitation of the
electrons from the small loop produced only weak thermal response because the
loop volume was small, while the electrons trapped in the big loop lost most of
their energy in the coronal part of the loop, which resulted in the coronal
plasma heating but no or only weak chromospheric evaporation, and thus
unusually weak soft X-ray emission. Energy losses of fast electrons in the big
tenuous loop were slow resulting in the observed delay of the plasma heating.
We determined that the impulsively accelerated electron population had a beamed
angular distribution in the direction of electric force along the magnetic
field of the small loop. The accelerated particle transport in big loop was
primarily mediated by turbulent waves like in the other reported cold flares.

  Using Highly Concentrated Catholytes",,,,,"physics.chem-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Lithium-air batteries have been considered as ultimate solutions for the
power source of long-range electrified transportation, but state-of-the-art
prototypes still suffer from short cycle life, low efficiency and poor power
output. Here, a lithium-bromine rechargeable fuel cell using highly
concentrated bromine catholytes is demonstrated with comparable specific
energy, improved power density, and higher efficiency. The cell is similar in
structure to a hybrid-electrolyte Li-air battery, where a lithium metal anode
in nonaqueous electrolyte is separated from aqueous bromine catholytes by a
lithium-ion conducting ceramic plate. The cell with a flat graphite electrode
can discharge at a peak power density around 9mW cm-2 and in principle could
provide a specific energy of 791.8 Wh kg-1, superior to most existing cathode
materials and catholytes. It can also run in regenerative mode to recover the
lithium metal anode and free bromine with 80-90% voltage efficiency, without
any catalysts. Degradation of the solid electrolyte and the evaporation of
bromine during deep charging are challenges that should be addressed in
improved designs to fully exploit the high specific energy of liquid bromine.
The proposed system offers a potential power source for long-range electric
vehicles, beyond current Li-ion batteries yet close to envisioned Li-air
batteries.

regularization approaches were studied for simultaneous variable selection and

existing variable selection methods, including Lasso and its generations,
cannot distinguish covariates with weak and no contribution. Thus, prediction
based on a subset model of selected covariates only can be inefficient. In this
paper, we propose a post selection shrinkage estimation strategy to improve the
prediction performance of a selected subset model. Such a post selection
shrinkage estimator (PSE) is data-adaptive and constructed by shrinking a post
selection weighted ridge estimator in the direction of a selected candidate
subset. Under an asymptotic distributional quadratic risk criterion, its
prediction performance is explored analytically. We show that the proposed post
selection PSE performs better than the post selection weighted ridge estimator.
More importantly, it improves the prediction performance of any candidate
subset model selected from most existing Lasso-type variable selection methods
significantly. The relative performance of the post selection PSE is
demonstrated by both simulation studies and real data analysis.

to 1901, from old observations of the star found in several archival plates of
M 33. These old recordings together with published and new data show that for
at least half a century the star was in a low luminosity state, with B ~18.
After 1960, five large variability cycles of visual luminosity were recorded.
The amplitude of the oscillations was seen increasing towards the 1992-1994
maximum, then decreasing during the last maxima. The recent light curve
indicates that the photometric variations have been quite similar in all the
bands, and that the B-V color index has been constant within +/-0.1 m despite
the 1.5m change of the visual luminosity. The spectrum of GR 290 at the large
maximum of 1992-94, was equivalent to late-B type, while, during 2002-2014, it
has varied between WN10h-11h near the visual maxima to WN8h-9h at the
luminosity minima. We have detected, during this same period, a clear
anti-correlation between the visual luminosity, the strength of the HeII 4686 A
emission line, the strength of the 4600-4700 A lines blend and the spectral
type. From a model analysis of the spectra collected during the whole 2002-2014
period we find that the Rosseland radius R_{2/3}, changed between the minimum
and maximum luminosity phases by a factor of 3, while T_eff varied between
about 33,000 K and 23,000 K. The bolometric luminosity of the star was not
constant, but increased by a factor of ~1.5 between minimum and maximum
luminosity, in phase with the apparent luminosity variations. In the light of
current evolutionary models of very massive stars, we find that GR 290 has
evolved from a ~60 M_Sun progenitor star and should have an age of about 4
million years. We argue that it has left the LBV stage and is moving to a
Wolf-Rayet stage of late nitrogen spectral type.

period and eclipse duration recently reported by Bozzo et al.\ (2016). We find
that the donor is most likely a main-sequence star with the mass comprised
within the range $\sim$(0.5--$0.8){\rm M}_{\odot}$ and the radius of $\sim\!
0.7{\rm R}_{\odot}$. Assuming that the accreting compact object in IGR
J17451--3022 is a neutron star, the duration of the nearly total rectangular
eclipses yields the inclination angle of the system of $71^\circ\lesssim
i\lesssim 76^\circ$, compatible with the presence of dips in this system. We
rule out the presence of either brown or white dwarf. However, we find an
alternative possibility that the donor star in IGR J17451--3022 could be a
partially stripped giant with a very low mass, $\sim\! 0.2{\rm M}_{\odot}$.
This case requires a substantial mass loss prior to the formation of the

errors in training data lead to misclassifications in test points, and propose
an automated method to find the root causes of such misclassifications. Our
root cause analysis is based on Pearl's theory of causation, and uses Pearl's
PS (Probability of Sufficiency) as a scoring metric. Our implementation, Psi,
encodes the computation of PS as a probabilistic program, and uses recent work
on probabilistic programs and transformations on probabilistic programs (along

Psi is able to identify root causes of data errors in interesting data sets.

applied magnetic field along the critical lines characterized by a gapless
excitation spectrum. We find that, while the boundary interaction Hamiltonian
describing the junction can be recasted in the form of a four-channel, spin-1/2
antiferromagnetic Kondo Hamiltonian, the number of channels effectively
participating in the Kondo effect depends on the chain parameters, as well as
on the boundary couplings at the junction. The system evolves from an effective
four-channel topological Kondo effect for a junction of XX-chains with
symmetric boundary couplings into a two-channel one at a junction of three
quantum critical Ising chains. The effective number of Kondo channels depends
on the properties of the boundary and of the bulk. The XX-line is a ""critical""
line, where a four-channel topological Kondo effect can be recovered by
fine-tuning the boundary parameter, while along the line in parameter space
connecting the extreme regimes, XX-line and the critical Ising point the
junction is effectively equivalent to a two-channel topological Kondo
Hamiltonian. Using a renormalization group approach, we determine the flow of
the boundary couplings, which allows us to define and estimate the critical
couplings and Kondo temperatures of the different Kondo (pair) channels.
Finally, we study the local transverse magnetization in the center of the
Y-junction, eventually arguing that it provides an effective tool to monitor
the onset of the two-channel Kondo effect.

investigated in views of developments for optical telecommunications. Today,
properties in the mid-infrared (mid-IR) are of interest for molecular
spectroscopy applications. In particular, high-sensitivity spectroscopic
techniques based on high-finesse mid-IR cavities hold high promise for medical
applications. Due to exceptional purity and low losses, whispering gallery mode
microresonators based on polished alkaline earth metal fluoride crystals (i.e
the $\mathrm{XF_2}$ family, where X $=$ Ca, Mg, Ba, Sr,...) have attained
ultra-high quality (Q) factor resonances (Q$>$10$^{8}$) in the near-IR and
visible spectral ranges. Here we report for the first time ultra-high Q factors
in the mid-IR using crystalline microresonators. Using an uncoated chalcogenide
(ChG) tapered fiber, light from a continuous wave quantum cascade laser (QCL)
is efficiently coupled to several crystalline microresonators at 4.4 $\mu$m
wavelength. We measure the optical Q factor of fluoride crystals in the mid-IR
using cavity ringdown technique. We observe that $\mathrm{MgF_2}$
microresonators feature quality factors that are very close to the fundamental
absorption limit, as caused by the crystal's multiphonon absorption
(Q$\sim$10$^{7}$), in contrast to near-IR measurements far away from these
fundamental limits. Due to lower multiphonon absorption in $\mathrm{BaF_2}$ and
$\mathrm{SrF_2}$, we show that ultra-high quality factors of Q $\geqslant$ 1.4
$\times 10^{8}$ can be reached at 4.4 $\mu$m. This corresponds to an optical
finesse of $\mathcal{F}>$4$\cdot$ 10$^{4}$, the highest value achieved for any
type of mid-IR resonator to date, and a more than 10-fold improvement over the
state-of-the-art. Such compact ultra-high Q crystalline microresonators provide
a route for narrow linewidth frequency-stabilized QCL or mid-IR Kerr comb

mid-transit times from the exact periodicity. One of the most interesting
causes of TTVs is the gravitational interaction between planets. Here we
consider a case of two planets in a mean motion resonance (orbital periods in a
ratio of small integers). This case is important because the resonant
interaction can amplify the TTV effect and allow planets to be detected more
easily. We develop an analytic model of the resonant dynamics valid for small
orbital eccentricities and use it to derive the principal TTV terms. We find
that a resonant system should show TTV terms with two basic periods (and their
harmonics). The resonant TTV period is proportional (m/M_*)^(-2/3), where m and
M_* are the planetary and stellar masses. For m=10^(-4) M_*, for example, the
TTV period exceeds the orbital period by ~2 orders of magnitude. The amplitude
of the resonant TTV terms scales linearly with the libration amplitude. The
ratio of the TTV amplitudes of two resonant planets is inversely proportional
to the ratio of their masses. These and other relationships discussed in the
main text can be used to aid the interpretation of TTV observations.

by MAGIC in spring 2007. Before that the source was little studied in different
wavelengths. Therefore a multi-wavelength (MWL) campaign was organized in
spring 2008. Along MAGIC, the MWL campaign included the Metsahovi radio
observatory, Bell and KVA optical telescopes and the Swift and AGILE
satellites. MAGIC observations span from March to May, 2008 for a total of 27.9
hours, of which 19.4 hours remained after quality cuts. The light curve showed
no significant variability. The differential VHE spectrum could be described
with a power-law function. Both results were similar to those obtained during
the discovery. Swift XRT observations revealed an X-ray flare, characterized by
a harder when brighter trend, as is typical for high synchrotron peak BL Lac
objects (HBL). Strong optical variability was found during the campaign, but no
conclusion on the connection between the optical and VHE gamma-ray bands could
be drawn. The contemporaneous SED shows a synchrotron dominated source, unlike
concluded in previous work based on nonsimultaneous data, and is well described
by a standard one zone synchrotron self Compton model. We also performed a
study on the source classification. While the optical and X-ray data taken
during our campaign show typical characteristics of an HBL, we suggest, based
on archival data, that 1ES 1011+496 is actually a borderline case between
intermediate and high synchrotron peak frequency BL Lac objects.

produces a mechanism to elicit privately-held, non-verifiable information from
self-interested agents. Formally, truth-telling is a strict Nash equilibrium of
the mechanism. Unfortunately, there may be other equilibria as well (including
uninformative equilibria where all players simply report the same fixed signal,
regardless of their true signal) and, typically, the truth-telling equilibrium
does not have the highest expected payoff. The main result of this paper is to
show that, in the symmetric binary setting, by tweaking peer-prediction, in
part by carefully selecting the proper scoring rule it is based on, we can make
the truth-telling equilibrium focal---that is, truth-telling has higher
expected payoff than any other equilibrium.
  Along the way, we prove the following: in the setting where agents receive
binary signals we 1) classify all equilibria of the peer-prediction mechanism;
2) introduce a new technical tool for understanding scoring rules, which allows
us to make truth-telling pay better than any other informative equilibrium; 3)
leverage this tool to provide an optimal version of the previous result; that
is, we optimize the gap between the expected payoff of truth-telling and other
informative equilibria; and 4) show that with a slight modification to the peer
prediction framework, we can, in general, make the truth-telling equilibrium
focal---that is, truth-telling pays more than any other equilibrium (including
the uninformative equilibria).

parallel. Empirical observations in practical systems suggest that the task
service times are highly random and the job service time is bottlenecked by the
slowest straggling task. One common solution for straggler mitigation is to
replicate a task on multiple servers and wait for one replica of the task to
finish early. The delay performance of replications depends heavily on the
scheduling decisions of when to replicate, which servers to replicate on, and
which job to serve first. So far, little is understood on how to optimize these
scheduling decisions for minimizing the delay to complete the jobs. In this
paper, we present a comprehensive study on delay-optimal scheduling of
replications in both centralized and distributed multi-server systems.
Low-complexity scheduling policies are designed and are proven to be
delay-optimal or near delay-optimal in stochastic ordering among all causal and
non-preemptive policies. These theoretical results are established for general
system settings and delay metrics that allow for arbitrary arrival processes,
arbitrary job sizes, arbitrary due times, and heterogeneous servers with data
locality constraints. Novel sample-path tools are developed to prove these
results.

the heterotic string on $T^7$, and type II strings on $K3 \times T^3$ -- are
related by U-duality, and share a moduli space of vacua parametrized by
$O(8,24; \mathbb{Z}) \backslash O(8,24) / (O(8) \times O(24))$. One can think
of this as the moduli space of even, self-dual 32-dimensional lattices with
signature (8,24). At 24 special points in moduli space, the lattice splits as
$\Gamma^{8,0} \oplus \Gamma^{0,24}$. $\Gamma^{0,24}$ can be the Leech lattice
or any of 23 Niemeier lattices, while $\Gamma^{8,0}$ is the $E_8$ root lattice.
We show that starting from this observation, one can find a precise connection
between the Umbral groups and type IIA string theory on $K3$. This provides a
natural physical starting point for understanding Mathieu and Umbral moonshine.
The maximal unbroken subgroups of Umbral groups in 6D (or any other limit) are
those obtained by starting at the associated Niemeier point and moving in
moduli space while preserving the largest possible subgroup of the Umbral
group. To illustrate the action of these symmetries on BPS states, we discuss
the computation of certain protected four-derivative terms in the effective
field theory, and recover facts about the spectrum and symmetry representations
of 1/2-BPS states.

considerable interest in searching for their faint and rapidly fading
electromagnetic (EM) counterparts, though GW position uncertainties are as
coarse as hundreds of square degrees. Because LIGO's sensitivity to binary
neutron stars is limited to the local universe, the area on the sky that must

about luminosity distance, combining the reconstructed volume with positions

reconstructs the full distribution of sky location and distance. We demonstrate
the first such algorithm, which takes under a minute, fast enough to enable

accretion disks produced by the tidal disruption of a white dwarf (WD) by a
binary neutron star (NS) companion. Nuclear reactions in the disk midplane burn
the WD matter to increasingly heavier elements at sequentially smaller radii,
releasing substantial energy which can impact the disk dynamics. A model for
disk outflows is employed, by which cooling from the outflow balances other
sources of heating (viscous, nuclear) in regulating the Bernoulli parameter of
the midplane to a fixed value $\lesssim 0$. We perform a comprehensive
parameter study of the compositional yields and velocity distributions of the
disk outflows for WDs of different initial compositions. For C/O WDs, the
radial composition profile of the disk evolves self-similarly in a
quasi-steady-state manner, and is remarkably robust to model parameters. The
nucleosynthesis in helium WD disks does not exhibit this behavior, which
instead depends sensitively on factors controlling the disk midplane density
(e.g. the strength of the viscosity, $\alpha$). By the end of the simulation, a
substantial fraction of the WD mass is unbound in outflows at characteristic
velocities of $\sim 10^9~{\rm cm~s}^{-1}$. The outflows from WD-NS merger disks
contain $10^{-4}-3 \times 10^{-3} M_\odot$ of radioactive $^{56}$Ni, resulting
in fast ($\sim$ week long) dim ($\sim10^{40}~{\rm erg~s}^{-1}$) optical
transients; shock heating of the ejecta by late time outflows may increase the
peak luminosity to $\sim 10^{43}~{\rm erg~s}^{-1}$. The accreted mass onto the
neutron star is probably not sufficient to induce gravitational collapse, but
may be capable of spinning up the NS to periods of $\sim 10~{\rm ms}$. This is
a new possible channel for forming isolated recycled pulsars.

modulation frequencies, because of the fast carrier dynamics arising from BPs
moderate bandgap. The high photoresponse at mid infrared wavelengths and the
large dynamic bandwidth, together with its unique polarization dependent
response induced by low crystalline symmetry, can be coalesced to promise
photonic applications such as chip-scale mid-infrared sensing and imaging at
low light levels.

tolerating faults, attacks, and misbehavior among a subset of the processes.
The established state-machine replication paradigm inherently requires the
application to be deterministic. This paper distinguishes three models for
dealing with non-determinism in replicated services, where some processes are
subject to faults and arbitrary behavior (so-called Byzantine faults): first, a
modular approach that does not require any changes to the potentially
non-deterministic application (and neither access to its internal data);
second, a master-slave approach, in which ties are broken by a leader and the
other processes validate the choices of the leader; and finally, a treatment of
applications that use cryptography and secret keys. Cryptographic operations
and secrets must be treated specially because they require strong randomness to
satisfy their goals.
  The paper also introduces two new protocols. The first uses the modular
approach for filtering out non-de\-ter\-min\-istic operations in an
application. It ensures that all correct processes produce the same outputs and
that their internal states do not diverge. The second protocol implements
cryptographically secure randomness generation with a verifiable random
function and is appropriate for certain security models. All protocols are
described in a generic way and do not assume a particular implementation of the
underlying consensus primitive.

Besides the rich dynamics that can be observed on the waves at the interface,
Faraday waves hide beneath them an elusive range of flow patterns --or
streaming patterns-- which have not been studied in detail until now. The
streaming patterns are responsible for a net circulation in the flow which are
reminiscent of convection cells. In this article, we analyse these streaming
flows by conducting experiments in a Faraday-wave setup. To visualize the
flows, tracers are used to generate both trajectory maps and to probe the
streaming velocity field via Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV). We identify
three types of patterns and experimentally show that identical Faraday waves
can mask streaming patterns that are qualitatively very different. Next we
propose a three-dimensional model that explains streaming flows in
quasi-inviscid fluids. We show that the streaming inside the fluid arises from
a complex coupling between the bulk and the boundary layers. This coupling can
be taken into account by applying modified boundary conditions in a
three-dimensional Navier-Stokes formulation for the streaming in the bulk.
Numerical simulations based on this theoretical framework show good qualitative
and quantitative agreement with experimental results. They also highlight the
relevance of three-dimensional effects in the streaming patterns. Our
simulations reveal that the variety of experimental patterns is deeply linked
to the boundary condition at the top interface, which may be strongly affected
by the presence of contaminants along the surface.

metrics that are singular along hypersurfaces. When the hypersurface is a
conformal infinity we give simple integrated distribution expressions for the
divergences and anomaly of the regulated volume functional valid for any choice
of regulator. For closed hypersurfaces or conformally compact geometries,
methods from a previously developed boundary calculus for conformally compact
manifolds can be applied to give explicit holographic formulae for the
divergences and anomaly expressed as hypersurface integrals over local
quantities (the method also extends to non-closed hypersurfaces). The resulting
anomaly does not depend on any particular choice of regulator, while the
regulator dependence of the divergences is precisely captured by these
formulae. Conformal hypersurface invariants can be studied by demanding that
the singular metric obey, smoothly and formally to a suitable order, a Yamabe
type problem with boundary data along the conformal infinity. We prove that the
volume anomaly for these singular Yamabe solutions is a conformally invariant
integral of a local Q-curvature that generalizes the Branson Q-curvature by
including data of the embedding. In each dimension this canonically defines a
higher dimensional generalization of the Willmore energy/rigid string action.

the density obstructing smooth solutions to this singular Yamabe problem; we

  Vrudhula","Digital IP Protection Using Threshold Voltage Control",,,,,"cs.CR cs.ET","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  This paper proposes a method to completely hide the functionality of a
digital standard cell. This is accomplished by a differential threshold logic
gate (TLG). A TLG with $n$ inputs implements a subset of Boolean functions of
$n$ variables that are linear threshold functions. The output of such a gate is
one if and only if an integer weighted linear arithmetic sum of the inputs
equals or exceeds a given integer threshold. We present a novel architecture of
a TLG that not only allows a single TLG to implement a large number of complex
logic functions, which would require multiple levels of logic when implemented
using conventional logic primitives, but also allows the selection of that
subset of functions by assignment of the transistor threshold voltages to the
input transistors. To obfuscate the functionality of the TLG, weights of some
inputs are set to zero by setting their device threshold to be a high $V_t$.
The threshold voltage of the remaining transistors is set to low $V_t$ to
increase their transconductance. The function of a TLG is not determined by the
cell itself but rather the signals that are connected to its inputs. This makes
it possible to hide the support set of the function by essentially removing
some variable from the support set of the function by selective assignment of
high and low $V_t$ to the input transistors. We describe how a standard cell
library of TLGs can be mixed with conventional standard cells to realize
complex logic circuits, whose function can never be discovered by reverse
engineering. A 32-bit Wallace tree multiplier and a 28-bit 4-tap filter were
synthesized on an ST 65nm process, placed and routed, then simulated including
extracted parastics with and without obfuscation. Both obfuscated designs had
much lower area (25%) and much lower dynamic power (30%) than their
nonobfuscated CMOS counterparts, operating at the same frequency.

It is shown that if enumeration is restricted to a subclass of cuts called
unidirectional cuts, the quality of solution does not degrade. We also show
that such cuts are equivalent to a known class of cuts called strong line cuts

of GPS devices, the map matching problem still represents an important and
valuable challenge. The process of associating a segment of the underlying road
network to a GPS point gives us the chance to enrich raw data with the semantic
layer provided by the roadmap, with all contextual information associated to
it, e.g. the presence of speed limits, attraction points, changes in elevation,
etc. Most state-of-art solutions for this classical problem simply look for the
shortest or fastest path connecting any pair of consecutive points in a trip.
While in some contexts that is reasonable, in this work we argue that the
shortest/fastest path assumption can be in general erroneous. Indeed, we show
that such approaches can yield travel times that are significantly incoherent
with the real ones, and propose a Time-Aware Map matching process that tries to
improve the state-of-art by taking into account also such temporal aspect. Our
algorithm results to be very efficient, effective on low- sampling data and to
outperform existing solutions, as proved by experiments on large datasets of
real GPS trajectories. Moreover, our algorithm is parameter-free and does not

droplets are stabilized by Janus nanoparticles of different shapes (spherical

sufficiently dense layer of particles on the droplets, we show that the
stabilization mechanism strongly depends on the collision speed. This is
consistent with a coalescence mechanism governed by the rheology of the
interfacial region. When the system is forced to coalesce sufficiently slowly,
we investigate at a mesoscopic level how the ability of the nanoparticles to
stabilize Pickering emulsions is discriminated by nanoparticle mobility and the
associated caging effect. These properties are both related to the
interparticle interaction and the hydrodynamic resistance in the liquid film

Chiral magnetic skyrmions with a well-defined spin topology resulting in a unit

of the recent progress made on investigating magnetic skyrmions, direct
observation of the skyrmion Hall effect in real space has, remained elusive.
Here, by using a current-induced spin Hall spin torque, we experimentally
observe the skyrmion Hall effect by driving skyrmions from creep motion into
the steady flow motion regime. We observe a Hall angle for the magnetic
skyrmion motion as large as 15 degree for current densities smaller than 10

accretion flow and investigated their detailed properties. In extremely low
accretion rate systems, the collisional mean-free path of electrons is large
compared with the length-scale of the system, thus thermal conduction is
dynamically important. When the magnetic field is present, the thermal
conduction is anisotropic and energy transport is along magnetic field lines.
In this paper, we study the effects of anisotropic thermal conduction on the
wind production in hot accretion flows by performing two-dimensional
magnetohydrodynamic simulations. We find that thermal conduction has only
moderate effects on the mass flux of wind. But the energy flux of wind can be
increased by a factor of $\sim 10$ due to the increase of wind velocity when
thermal conduction is included. The increase of wind velocity is because of the
increase of driving forces (e.g. gas pressure gradient force and centrifugal
force) when thermal conduction is included. This result demonstrates that
thermal conduction plays an important role in determining the properties of
wind.

Jaccard similarity is known to have poor performance over sets with large
differences in their domain sizes. We demonstrate that the domains found in
several real-life Open Data and web data repositories show a power-law

  We present a new index structure, Locality Sensitive Hashing (LSH) Ensemble,

Our index structure and search algorithm cope with the data volume and skew by
means of data sketches (MinHash) and domain partitioning. Our index structure
does not assume a prescribed set of values. We construct a cost model that
describes the accuracy of LSH Ensemble with any given partitioning. This allows
us to formulate the partitioning for LSH Ensemble as an optimization problem.
We prove that there exists an optimal partitioning for any distribution.
Furthermore, for datasets following a power-law distribution, as observed in
Open Data and Web data corpora, we show that the optimal partitioning can be
approximated using equi-depth, making it efficient to use in practice.
  We evaluate our algorithm using real data (Canadian Open Data and WDC Web

candidate proposals using their interior features. However, global and local
surrounding contexts that are believed to be valuable for object detection are
not fully exploited by existing methods yet. In this work, we take a step
towards understanding what is a robust practice to extract and utilize
contextual information to facilitate object detection in practice.
Specifically, we consider the following two questions: ""how to identify useful
global contextual information for detecting a certain object?"" and ""how to
exploit local context surrounding a proposal for better inferring its
contents?"". We provide preliminary answers to these questions through
developing a novel Attention to Context Convolution Neural Network (AC-CNN)
based object detection model. AC-CNN effectively incorporates global and local
contextual information into the region-based CNN (e.g. Fast RCNN) detection
model and provides better object detection performance. It consists of one
attention-based global contextualized (AGC) sub-network and one multi-scale
local contextualized (MLC) sub-network. To capture global context, the AGC
sub-network recurrently generates an attention map for an input image to
highlight useful global contextual locations, through multiple stacked Long
Short-Term Memory (LSTM) layers. For capturing surrounding local context, the
MLC sub-network exploits both the inside and outside contextual information of
each specific proposal at multiple scales. The global and local context are
then fused together for making the final decision for detection. Extensive
experiments on PASCAL VOC 2007 and VOC 2012 well demonstrate the superiority of
the proposed AC-CNN over well-established baselines. In particular, AC-CNN
outperforms the popular Fast-RCNN by 2.0% and 2.2% on VOC 2007 and VOC 2012 in
terms of mAP, respectively.

polar distortion in some ferroelectric materials, whereas the coexistence of
polar distortion and metallicity were found in several non-central-symmetric
metals (NCSMs). Therefore, the mechanisms and designing of NCSMs have attracted
great interests. In this work, by first-principles calculation, we found the
polar distortion in the lone-pair driven ferroelectric material PbTiO$_3$ can
not only persist, but also increase with electron doping. We further analyzed
the mechanisms of the persisting of the polar distortion. We found that the Ti
site polar instability is suppressed but the Pb site polar instability is
intact with the electron doping. The Pb-site instability is due to the
lone-pair mechanism which can be viewed as a pseudo-Jahn-Teller effect, a mix
of the ground state and the excited state by ion displacement from the central
symmetric position. The lone-pair mechanism is not strongly affected by the
electron doping because neither the ground state or the excited state involved
is at the Fermi energy. The enhancement of the polar distortion is related to
the increasing of the Ti ion size by doping. These results show the lone-pair
stereoactive ions can be used in designing NCSMs.

of hierarchical galaxy formation, as accreted satellite galaxies are tidally
disrupted by their host. We investigate whether or not global properties of the
ESC could be used to test of dark matter, reasoning that they should be
sensitive to the abundance of low-mass satellites, and therefore the underlying
dark matter model. Using cosmological simulations of galaxy formation in the
favoured Cold Dark Matter (CDM) and Warm Dark Matter (WDM) models ($m_{\rm
WDM}$=0.5,1,2 keV/$c^2$), which suppress the abundance of low-mass satellites,
we find that the kinematics and orbital structure of the ESC is consistent
across models. However, we find striking differences in its spatial structure,
as anticipated -- a factor of $\sim$10 drop in spherically averaged mass
density between $\sim$10% and $\sim$75% of the virial radius in the more
extreme WDM runs ($m_{\rm WDM}$=0.5, 1 keV/$c^2$) relative to the CDM run.
These differences are consistent with the mass assembly histories of the
different components, and are present across redshifts. However, even the least
discrepant of the WDM models is incompatible with current observational limits
on $m_{\rm WDM}$. Importantly, the differences we observe when varying the
underlying dark matter are comparable to the galaxy-to-galaxy variation we
expect within a fixed dark matter model. This suggests that it will be
challenging to place limits on dark matter using only the unresolved spatial
structure of the the ESC.

volumes typically have high quality factors ($>10^6$). This is due to a reduced
sensitivity to surface dielectric losses, which is the limiting source of
dissipation in two-dimensional transmission line resonators. In recent years,
3D microwave cavities have been extensively used for coupling and interacting
with superconducting quantum bits (qubits), providing a versatile platform for
quantum information processing and hybrid quantum systems. A current issue that
has arisen is that 3D superconducting cavities do not permit magnetic field
control of qubits embedded in these cavities. In contrast, microwave cavities
made of normal metals can be transparent to magnetic fields, but experience a
much lower quality factor ($\sim 10^4$), which negates many of the advantages
of the 3D architecture. In an attempt to create a device that bridges a gap
between these two types of cavities, having magnetic field control and high
quality factor, we have created a hybrid 3D cavity. This new cavity is
primarily composed of aluminium but also contains a small copper insert. We
measured the internal quality factor of the hybrid cavity to be $102000$, which
is an order of magnitude improvement over all previously tested copper
cavities. An added benefit to that our hybrid cavity possesses is that it also
provides an improved thermal link to the sample that superconducting cavities
alone cannot provide. In order to demonstrate precise magnetic control within
the cavity, we performed spectroscopy of three superconducting qubits placed in
the cavity, where individual control of each qubit's frequency was exerted with
small wire coils attached to the cavity. A large improvement in quality factor
and magnetic field control makes this 3D hybrid cavity an attractive new
platform for circuit quantum electrodynamics experiments.

investigations for this purpose adapted biological epidemic models, and thus
inherited the so-called homogeneity assumption that each node is equally
connected to others. Later studies relaxed this often-unrealistic homogeneity
assumption, but still focused on certain power-law networks. Recently,
researchers investigated epidemic models in {\em arbitrary} networks (i.e., no
restrictions on network topology). However, all these models only capture {\em
push-based} infection, namely that an infectious node always actively attempts
to infect its neighboring nodes. Very recently, the concept of {\em pull-based}
infection was introduced but was not treated rigorously. Along this line of
research, the present paper investigates push- and pull-based epidemic
spreading dynamics in arbitrary networks, using a Non-linear Dynamical Systems
approach. The paper advances the state of the art as follows: (1) It presents a
more general and powerful sufficient condition (also known as epidemic
threshold in the literature) under which the spreading will become stable. (2)
It gives both upper and lower bounds on the global mean infection rate,
regardless of the stability of the spreading. (3) It offers insights into,
among other things, the estimation of the global mean infection rate through
localized monitoring of a small {\em constant} number of nodes, {\em without}

peak time. The 0.3-10 keV isotropic energy of X-ray flares distribution is a
lognormal peaked at $10^{51.2}$ erg. We also study the frequency distributions
of flare parameters, including energies, durations, peak fluxes, rise times,
decay times and waiting times. Power-law distributions of energies, durations,
peak fluxes, and waiting times are found in GRB X-ray flares and solar flares.
These distributions could be well explained by a fractal-diffusive,
self-organized criticality model. Some theoretical models basing on magnetic
reconnection have been proposed to explain X-ray flares. Our result shows that
the relativistic jets of GRBs may be Poynting-flux dominated.

attacks can be predicted. Despite its evident importance, this problem was not
investigated until very recently, when we proposed using the innovative
methodology of {\em gray-box prediction}. This methodology advocates the use of
gray-box models, which accommodate the statistical properties/phenomena
exhibited by the data. Specifically, we showed that gray-box models that
accommodate the Long-Range Dependence (LRD) phenomenon can predict the attack
rate (i.e., the number of attacks per unit time) 1-hour ahead-of-time with an
accuracy of 70.2-82.1\%. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first result
showing the feasibility of prediction in this domain. We observe that the
prediction errors are partly caused by the models' incapability in predicting
the large attack rates, which are called {\em extreme values} in statistics.
This motivates us to analyze the {\em extreme-value phenomenon}, by using two
complementary approaches: the Extreme Value Theory (EVT) and the Time Series
Theory (TST). In this paper, we show that EVT can offer long-term predictions
(e.g., 24-hour ahead-of-time), while gray-box TST models can predict attack
rates 1-hour ahead-of-time with an accuracy of 86.0-87.9\%. We explore
connections between the two approaches, and point out future research
directions. Although our prediction study is based on specific cyber attack
data, our methodology can be equally applied to analyze any cyber attack data

demonstrate use of the framework, we apply it to analyze a low-interaction
honeypot dataset, while noting that the framework can be equally applied to
analyze high-interaction honeypot data that contains richer information about
the attacks. The case study finds, for the first time, that Long-Range
Dependence (LRD) is exhibited by honeypot-captured cyber attacks. The case
study confirms that by exploiting the statistical properties (LRD in this
case), it is feasible to predict cyber attacks (at least in terms of attack

sufficient early-warning time for defenders to adjust their defense

relatively wide range of consecutive IP addresses, we successfully uncover
intrinsic spatiotemporal patterns underlying cyberattacks, where the term
""spatio"" refers to the IP address space. In particular, we focus on analyzing
{\em macroscopic} properties of the attack traffic flows and identify two main
patterns with distinct spatiotemporal characteristics: deterministic and
stochastic. Strikingly, there are very few sets of major attackers committing
almost all the attacks, since their attack ""fingerprints"" and target selection
scheme can be unequivocally identified according to the very limited number of
unique spatiotemporal characteristics, each of which only exists on a
consecutive IP region and differs significantly from the others. We utilize a
number of quantitative measures, including the flux-fluctuation law, the Markov
state transition probability matrix, and predictability measures, to
characterize the attack patterns in a comprehensive manner. A general finding
is that the attack patterns possess high degrees of predictability, potentially
paving the way to anticipating and, consequently, mitigating or even preventing
large-scale cyberattacks using macroscopic approaches.

ensemble MVA method for searching $\tau^{+}\tau^{-}$ channel of Higgs bosons in
high energy physics. DEFE can be viewed as a deep ensemble learning scheme that
trains a strongly diverse set of neural feature learners without explicitly
encouraging diversity and penalizing correlations. This is achieved by adopting
an implicit neural controller (not involved in feedforward compuation) that
directly controls and distributes gradient flows from higher level deep
prediction network. Such model-independent controller results in that every
single local feature learned are used in the feature-to-output mapping stage,
avoiding the blind averaging of features. DEFE makes the ensembles 'deep' in
the sense that it allows deep post-process of these features that tries to
learn to select and abstract the ensemble of neural feature learners. With the
application of this model, a selection regions full of signal process can be
obtained through the training of a miniature collision events set. In
comparison of the Classic Deep Neural Network, DEFE shows a state-of-the-art
performance: the error rate has decreased by about 37\%, the accuracy has
broken through 90\% for the first time, along with the discovery significance
has reached a standard deviation of 6.0 $\sigma$. Experimental data shows that,
DEFE is able to train an ensemble of discriminative feature learners that
boosts the overperformance of final prediction.

  I devise an accurate and precise procedure for characterizing any multi-port

is achieved by estimating and correcting systematic errors that arise due to
spatiotemporal and polarization mode mismatch. Enhanced accuracy and precision
are attained by fitting experimental coincidence data to a curve simulated
using measured source spectra. The efficacy of our characterization procedure
is verified by numerical simulations.
  I develop group-theoretic methods for the analysis and simulation of linear
interferometers. I devise a graph-theoretic algorithm to construct the boson
realizations of the canonical SU$(n)$ basis states, which reduce the canonical
subgroup chain, for arbitrary $n$. The boson realizations are employed to
construct $\mathcal{D}$-functions, which are the matrix elements of arbitrary
irreducible representations, of SU$(n)$ in the canonical basis. I show that
immanants of principal submatrices of a unitary matrix $T$ are a sum of the
diagonal $\mathcal{D}(\Omega)$-functions of group element $\Omega$ over $t$
determined by the choice of submatrix and over the irrep $(\lambda)$ determined
by the immanant under consideration. The algorithm for $\mathrm{SU}(n)$
$\mathcal{D}$-function computation and the results connecting these functions

porous dust aggregates were calculated using a rigorous method, the T-matrix
method, and the results were then compared with those obtained using the
Rayleigh-Gans-Debye (RGD) theory and Mie theory with the effective medium
approximation (EMT). The RGD theory is applicable to moderately large
aggregates made of nearly transparent monomers. This study considered two types
of porous dust aggregates, ballistic cluster-cluster agglomerates (BCCAs) and
ballistic particle-cluster agglomerates (BPCAs). First, the angular dependence
of the scattered intensity was shown to reflect the hierarchical structure of
dust aggregates; the large-scale structure of the aggregates is responsible for
the intensity at small scattering angles, and their small-scale structure
determines the intensity at large scattering angles. Second, it was determined
that the EMT underestimates the backward scattering intensity by multiple
orders of magnitude, especially in BCCAs, because the EMT averages the
structure within the size of the aggregates. It was concluded that the RGD
theory is a very useful method for calculating the optical properties of BCCAs.

techniques come at hand to propose flexible models that are unexposed to the
curse of dimensionality. In this work a semiparametric copula-based estimator
for conditional quantiles is investigated for complete or right-censored data.
In spirit, the methodology is extending the recent work of Noh et al. (2013)
and Noh et al. (2015), as the main idea consists in appropriately defining the
quantile regression in terms of a multivariate copula and marginal
distributions. Prior estimation of the latter and simple plug-in lead to an
easily implementable estimator expressed, for both contexts with or without
censoring, as a weighted quantile of the observed response variable. In
addition, and contrary to the initial suggestion in the literature, a
semiparametric estimation scheme for the multivariate copula density is
studied, motivated by the possible shortcomings of a purely parametric approach
and driven by the regression context. The resulting quantile regression
estimator has the valuable property of being automatically monotonic across
quantile levels, and asymptotic normality for both complete and censored data
is obtained under classical regularity conditions. Finally, numerical examples
as well as a real data application are used to illustrate the validity and
finite sample performance of the proposed procedure.

main goals of quantum information theory. A prominent example for such a
scenario is the task of quantum state merging where two parties aim to merge
their parts of a tripartite quantum state. In standard quantum state merging,
entanglement is considered as an expensive resource, while local quantum
operations can be performed at no additional cost. However, recent developments
show that some local operations could be more expensive than others: it is
reasonable to distinguish between local incoherent operations and local
operations which can create coherence. This idea leads us to the task of
incoherent quantum state merging, where one of the parties has free access to
local incoherent operations only. In this case the resources of the process are
quantified by pairs of entanglement and coherence. Here, we develop tools for
studying this process, and apply them to several relevant scenarios. While
quantum state merging can lead to a gain of entanglement, our results imply
that no merging procedure can gain entanglement and coherence at the same time.
We also provide a general lower bound on the entanglement-coherence sum, and
show that the bound is tight for all pure states. Our results also lead to an
incoherent version of Schumacher compression: in this case the compression rate
is equal to the von Neumann entropy of the diagonal elements of the
corresponding quantum state.

electronic tracking devices, the analysis of animal movement data has recently
emerged as a cottage industry amongst biostatisticians. New approaches of ever
greater complexity are continue to be added to the literature. In this paper,
we review what we believe to be some of the most popular and most useful
classes of statistical models used to analyze individual animal movement data.
Specifically we consider discrete-time hidden Markov models, more general
state-space models and diffusion processes. We argue that these models should
be core components in the toolbox for quantitative researchers working on
stochastic modelling of individual animal movement. The paper concludes by
offering some general observations on the direction of statistical analysis of
animal movement. There is a trend in movement ecology toward what are arguably
overly-complex modelling approaches which are inaccessible to ecologists,
unwieldy with large data sets or not based in mainstream statistical practice.
Additionally, some analysis methods developed within the ecological community
ignore fundamental properties of movement data, potentially leading to
misleading conclusions about animal movement. Corresponding approaches, e.g.
based on L\'evy walk-type models, continue to be popular despite having been
largely discredited. We contend that there is a need for an appropriate balance
between the extremes of either being overly complex or being overly simplistic,
whereby the discipline relies on models of intermediate complexity that are
usable by general ecologists, but grounded in well-developed statistical
practice and efficient to fit to large data sets.

Information at the Transmitters (CSIT), whose error decays with the
Signal-to-Noise-Ratio. With such configuration, we characterize the achievable
Degrees-of-Freedom (DoF) regions in both BC and IC, by proposing a
Rate-Splitting approach, which divides each receiver's message into a common
part and a private part. Compared to the RS scheme designed for the symmetric
MIMO case, this scheme is suitable for the general asymmetric deployment with
an arbitrary number of antennas at each node. In BC, the proposed block 1)
employs an unequal power allocation to the private messages of the two
receivers, 2) exploits the benefit of having an extra spatial dimension at one
receiver, and 3) is carried out with a Space-Time transmission. These features
enable the scheme to yield a greater DoF region than trivially extending the
scheme designed for the symmetric case. In IC, we modify the scheme proposed
for the BC case by applying a linear transformation to the channel matrices.
Such a linear transformation allows us to identify the signal space where the
two transmitted signals interfere with each other and propose a proper power
allocation policy. The achievable DoF regions are shown to be optimal for some
antenna configurations.

important limits on the scattering cross sections $\sigma_q$ between the light
quarks and the non-interacting scalar dark matter (DM). By analyzing a set of
1403 of solitary pulsarlike compact stars in the Milky Way, we find the old
solitary pulsar PSR J1801-0857D can set the most stringent upper limits on
$\sigma_q$ or the DM-proton scattering cross sections $\sigma_p$. By converting
$\sigma_q$ into $\sigma_p$ based on effective operator analyses, we show the
resulting $\sigma_p$ limit by assuming PSR J1801-0857D to be a SQS could be
comparable with that of the current direct detection experiments but much
weaker (by several orders of magnitude) than that obtained by assuming PSR
J1801-0857D to be a neutron star (NS), which requires an extremely small
$\sigma_p$ far beyond the limits of direct detection experiments. Our findings
imply that the old pulsars are favored to be SQSs rather than NSs if the scalar
DM were observed by future terrestrial experiments.

angular distribution on the sky of time derivatives of the scale factor, in
particular the Hubble parameter H_0, the deceleration parameter q_0, and the
jerk parameter j_0. We apply a recently published method to complement probing
the inhomogeneity of the large-scale structure by means of the inhomogeneity in
the cosmic expansion. This parametrisation is independent of the cosmological
equation of state, which renders it adequate to test interpretations of the
cosmic acceleration alternative to the cosmological constant. For the same
analytical toy model of an inhomogeneous ensemble of homogenous pixels, we
derive the backreaction term in j_0 due to the fluctuations of {H_0,q_0} and
measure it to be of order 10^{-2} times the corresponding average over the
pixels in the absence of backreaction. In agreement with that computed using a
Lambda CDM parametrisation of the luminosity distance, the backreaction effect
on q_0 remains below the detection threshold. Although the backreaction effect
on j_0 is about ten times that on q_0, it is also below the detection
threshold. Hence backreaction remains unobservable both in q_0 and in j_0.

of linear size L in voxels. Then, a number of trial configurations can be
generated by a model of overlapping spheres of a fixed radius, which are
randomly distributed on a regular lattice. The TEPL describes the averaged
maximum of the ED as a function of the phase concentration and the radius.
Thus, it can be used to determine the radius. The suggested approach is tested
on surrogate samples of ceramic and carbonate. In each of the cases, fifty
low-cost trials provided a few good enough candidates to a selection of the
optimal reconstruction. When a better accuracy is planned, the final
reconstructions can serve as the starting configurations. Then, the resulting
reconstructions should be competitive indeed to those starting with random

skewness of the meta-distribution.
  We first present an exact probability distribution (meta-distribution) for

distribution for small samples $2<n \leq n^*\approx 30$ as well as the limiting
one as the sample size $n$ becomes large. We also look at the properties of the

  P-values are shown to be extremely skewed and volatile, regardless of the
sample size $n$, and vary greatly across repetitions of exactly same protocols
under identical stochastic copies of the phenomenon; such volatility makes the
minimum $p$ value diverge significantly from the ""true"" one. Setting the power

modeled local potential energy surface reveals a departure between electrically
stressed and unstressed water. The observed differences show that the local
environment is changed by the applied electric field although weak relative to
the intermolecular coulombic field. When discussing the results we show that
the current methods used to simulate the pair potentials are still insufficient
to treat such non-equilibrium systems and further simulation techniques have to
be developed to properly reconstruct the microscopic dielectric relaxation

body tissue is a complicated spatio-temporal multiscale process which enables a
localised solid tumour to transform into a systemic, metastatic and fatal
disease. This process explores and takes advantage of the reciprocal relation
that solid tumours establish with the extracellular matrix (ECM) components and
other multiple distinct cell types from the surrounding microenvironment.
Through the secretion of various proteolytic enzymes such as matrix
metalloproteinases (MMP) or the urokinase plasminogen activator (uPA), the
cancer cell population alters the configuration of the surrounding ECM
composition and overcomes the physical barriers to ultimately achieve local
cancer spread into the surrounding tissue. The active interplay between the
tissue-scale tumour dynamics and the molecular mechanics of the involved
proteolytic enzymes at the cell-scale underlines the biologically multiscale
character of invasion, and raises the challenge of modelling this process with
an appropriate multiscale approach. In this paper, we present a new two-scale
moving boundary model of cancer invasion that explores the tissue scale tumour
dynamics in conjunction with the molecular dynamics of the urokinase
plasminogen activation system. Building on the multiscale moving boundary
method proposed in [58], the modelling that we propose here allows us to study
the changes in tissue scale tumour morphology caused by the cell-scale uPA
micro-dynamics occurring along the invasive edge of the tumour. Our
computational simulation results demonstrate a range of heterogeneous dynamics
which are qualitatively similar to the invasive growth patterns observed in a
number of different types of cancer, such as the tumour infiltrative growth
patterns discussed in [33].

experimental method to realize phonon blockade in a driven harmonic
nanomechanical resonator coupled to a qubit, where the coupling is proportional
to the second-order nonlinear susceptibility $\chi^{(2)}$. This is in contrast
to the standard realizations of phonon and photon blockade effects in Kerr-type
$\chi^{(3)}$ nonlinear systems. The nonlinear coupling strength can be adjusted
conveniently by changing the coherent drive field.As an example, we apply this
model to predict and describe phonon blockade in a nanomechanical resonator
coupled to a Cooper-pair box (i.e., a charge qubit) with a linear longitudinal
coupling. By obtaining the solutions of the steady state for this composite
system, we give the conditions forobserving strong antibunching and
sub-Poissonian phonon-number statistics in this induced second-order nonlinear
system. Besides using the qubit to produce phonon blockade states, the qubit
itself can also be employed to detect blockade effects by measuring its states.
Numerical simulations indicate that the robustness of the phonon blockade, and
the sensitivity of detecting it, will benefit from this strong induced

competition between two types of social response: conformity and
anticonformity. The proposed model builds on the q-voter model (Castellano et

the fraction $L$ of cross-links between cliques. In the regime of small values

suitable level of antagonistic interactions between segments is namely required

ratio (R), which measures the relative heat flux between two ends of a

asymmetry, the higher the R. However, by using nonequilibrium molecular
dynamics method we have calculated thermal transport in Si nanocones as an
example, the results show that such an understanding may be incorrect and R may
not increase monotonically with geometric asymmetry. Rather, R exhibits a sharp
reverse when the vertex angle ({\theta}) of the nanocone is approximately
90{\deg}. In other words, when {\theta} > 90{\deg}, R decreases, rather than
increasing. We show that this abnormal behavior is originated from a change in
the thermal transport mechanism. At small {\theta}s, phonon transport is
dominated by localized modes, especially for transport from tip to bottom. At
large {\theta}s, however, these localized modes disappear, leading to R

were detected recently by IceCube. This work is an attempt to show that if the
GRB identifications are verified, the observed time delays between the TeV
neutrinos and gamma-ray photons from GRBs provide attractive candidates for
testing fundamental physics with high accuracy. Based on the assumed
associations between the TeV neutrinos and GRBs, we find that the limiting
velocity of the neutrinos is equal to that of photons to an accuracy of
$\sim1.9\times10^{-15}-2.5\times10^{-18}$, which is about $10^{4}-10^{7}$ times
better than the constraint obtained with the neutrino possibly from a blazar
flare. In addition, we set the most stringent limits up to date on the energy
scale of quantum gravity for both the linear and quadratic violations of
Lorentz invariance, namely $E_{\rm QG, 1}>6.3\times10^{18}-1.5\times10^{21}$
GeV and $E_{\rm QG, 2}>2.0\times10^{11}-4.2\times10^{12}$ GeV, which are
essentially as good as or are an improvement of one order of magnitude over the
results previously obtained by the GeV photons of GRB 090510 and the PeV
neutrino from a blazar flare. Assuming that the Shapiro time delay is caused by
the gravitational potential of the Laniakea supercluster of galaxies, we also
place the tightest limits to date on Einstein's weak equivalence principle
through the relative differential variations of the parameterized
post-Newtonian parameter $\gamma$ values for two different species of particles
(i.e., neutrinos and photons), yielding $\Delta\gamma \sim 10^{-11}-10^{-13}$.
However, it should be emphasized again that these limits here obtained are at
best forecast of what could be achieved if the GRB/neutrino correlations would
be finally confirmed.

promising multi-user access scheme, non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) with

In NOMA, spectrum efficiency is improved by allowing more than one user to
simultaneously access the same frequency-time resource and separating
multi-user signals by SIC at the receiver. These render resource allocation and
optimization in NOMA different from orthogonal multiple access in 4G. In this
paper, we provide theoretical insights and algorithmic solutions to jointly
optimize power and channel allocation in NOMA. For utility maximization, we
mathematically formulate NOMA resource allocation problems. We characterize and
analyze the problems' tractability under a range of constraints and utility
functions. For tractable cases, we provide polynomial-time solutions for global
optimality. For intractable cases, we prove the NP-hardness and propose an
algorithmic framework combining Lagrangian duality and dynamic programming
(LDDP) to deliver near-optimal solutions. To gauge the performance of the
obtained solutions, we also provide optimality bounds on the global optimum.
Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed algorithmic solution can
significantly improve the system performance in both throughput and fairness
over orthogonal multiple access as well as over a previous NOMA resource

($a=0.21au$) means that the planet has a $13.9\pm2.0\%$ probability of
transits; this calls for photometric follow-up study.
  This massive warm Jupiter with a near circular orbit around an evolved
massive star can help set constraints on general migration mechanisms for warm
Jupiters and, given its high equilibrium temperature, can help test energy
deposition models in hot Jupiters.

reduced rates for the $^{14}$N(p,$\gamma$)$^{15}$O reaction. These convective

make the systems highly susceptible to signals that cause transitions between

between mechanical percolation of the actin network and myosin-generated

turn, force the emergence of ordered stress patterns. Reminiscent of second

Multi-Subregion based Correlation Filter Bank (MS-CFB), for robust face
recognition. MS-CFB combines the benefits of global-based and local-based
feature extraction algorithms, where multiple correlation filters correspond-
ing to different face subregions are jointly designed to optimize the overall
correlation outputs. Furthermore, we reduce the computational complexi- ty of
MS-CFB by designing the correlation filter bank in the spatial domain and
improve its generalization capability by capitalizing on the unconstrained form
during the filter bank design process. MS-CFB not only takes the d- ifferences
among face subregions into account, but also effectively exploits the
discriminative information in face subregions. Experimental results on various
public face databases demonstrate that the proposed algorithm pro- vides a
better feature representation for classification and achieves higher
recognition rates compared with several state-of-the-art algorithms.

triggered and located on average approximately two gamma-ray bursts (GRB) every
three days. Here we present the third of a series of catalogs of GRBs detected
by GBM, extending the second catalog by two more years, through the middle of
July 2014. The resulting list includes 1405 triggers identified as GRBs. The
intention of the GBM GRB catalog is to provide information to the community on
the most important observables of the GBM detected GRBs. For each GRB the
location and main characteristics of the prompt emission, the duration, peak
flux and fluence are derived. The latter two quantities are calculated for the
50-300~keV energy band, where the maximum energy release of GRBs in the
instrument reference system is observed, and also for a broader energy band
from 10-1000 keV, exploiting the full energy range of GBM's low-energy NaI(Tl)
detectors. Using statistical methods to assess clustering, we find that the
hardness and duration of GRBs are better fitted by a two-component model with
short-hard and long-soft bursts, than by a model with three components.
Furthermore, information is provided on the settings and modifications of the
triggering criteria and exceptional operational conditions during years five
and six in the mission. This third catalog is an official product of the Fermi
GBM science team, and the data files containing the complete results are

nuclear mass measurements at the National Superconducting Cyclotron Laboratory

time, with an atomic mass excess of -33.48(44) MeV. We find a significantly
different two-neutron separation energy S2n trend for neutron-rich isotopes of
chromium, removing the previously observed enhancement in binding at N=38.
Additionally, we extend the S2n trend for chromium to N=40, revealing behavior
consistent with the previously identified island of inversion in this region.
We compare our results to state-of-the-art shell-model calculations performed
with a modified Lenzi-Nowacki-Poves-Sieja interaction in the fp shell,
including the g9/2 and d5/2 orbits for the neutron valence space. We employ our
result for the mass of 64Cr in accreted neutron star crust network calculations
and find a reduction in the strength and depth of electron-capture heating from
the A=64 isobaric chain, resulting in a cooler than expected accreted neutron
star crust. This reduced heating is found to be due to the >1-MeV reduction in
binding for 64Cr with respect to values from commonly used global mass models.

analysis of quiescent spectra of 13 TeV gamma-ray detected
high-frequency-peaked BL Lacs (HBLs) following one-zone static
synchrotron-self-Compton (SSC) model. We determine the minimum, cooling break,

(DSA) theory. We find that HBLs have $P_B/P_e\sim6.3\times10^{-3}$ and the
radiative efficiency $\epsilon_{\rm rad,jet}\sim6.7\times10^{-4}$ where $P_B$
and $P_e$ is the Poynting and electron power, respectively. By assuming 10
leptons per one proton, the jet power relates to the black hole mass as $P_{\rm
jet}/L_{\rm Edd}\sim0.18$ where $P_{\rm jet}$ and $L_{\rm Edd}$ is the jet
power and the Eddington luminosity, respectively. Under our model assumptions,
we further find that HBLs have the jet production efficiency of $\eta_{\rm
jet}\sim1.5$ and the mass loading efficiency of $\xi_{\rm
jet}\gtrsim5\times10^{-2}$. We also investigate the particle acceleration
efficiency in the blazar zone by including the most recent Swift/BAT data. Our
samples ubiquitously have the particle acceleration efficiency of
$\eta_g\sim10^{4.5}$, which is inefficient to accelerate particles up to the
ultra-high-energy-cosmic-ray (UHECR) regime. This implies that the UHECR
acceleration sites should be other than the blazar zones of quiescent low power
AGN jets, if one assumes the one-zone SSC model based on the DSA theory.

mean square error (MMSE) of the interference that the transmission to the
primary receiver inflicts on the secondary receiver.
  The paper presents a new upper bound for the problem of maximizing the mutual
information subject to an MMSE constraint. The new bound holds for vector
inputs of any length and recovers a previously known limiting (when the length
of vector input tends to infinity) expression from the work of Bustin
$\textit{et al.}$ The key technical novelty is a new upper bound on the MMSE.
This bound allows one to bound the MMSE for all signal-to-noise ratio (SNR)
values $\textit{below}$ a certain SNR at which the MMSE is known (which
corresponds to the disturbance constraint). This bound complements the
`single-crossing point property' of the MMSE that upper bounds the MMSE for all
SNR values $\textit{above}$ a certain value at which the MMSE value is known.
The MMSE upper bound provides a refined characterization of the
phase-transition phenomenon which manifests, in the limit as the length of the
vector input goes to infinity, as a discontinuity of the MMSE for the problem
at hand.
  For vector inputs of size $n=1$, a matching lower bound, to within an
additive gap of order $O \left( \log \log \frac{1}{\sf MMSE} \right)$ (where
${\sf MMSE}$ is the disturbance constraint), is shown by means of the mixed

thus shows that, asymptotically, under strong enough sparsity conditions,
knowledge of $f_2,\dots,f_q$ has no effect on estimation accuracy. Our first
step is to estimate $f_1$ with an undersmoothed estimator based on
near-orthogonal projections with a group Lasso bias correction. We then
construct pseudo responses $\hat Y$ by evaluating a debiased modification of
our undersmoothed estimator of $f_1$ at the design points. In the second step
the smoothing method of the oracle estimator $\hat f_1^{\text{(oracle)}}$ is
applied to a nonparametric regression problem with responses $\hat Y$ and
covariates $X_1$. Our mathematical exposition centers primarily on establishing
properties of the presmoothing estimator. We present simulation results
demonstrating close-to-oracle performance of our estimator in practical
applications.

as crystal field effect is one of the key factors that determine the degree of
localization of the valence d/f states. Based on the localization, a set of
conventional mechanisms such as Mott-Hubbard, Charge-transfer and Slater were
formulated to explain the antiferromagnetic and insulating (AFI) phenomena in
many of these correlated systems. From the case study on LiFePO4, through
density-functional calculations, we demonstrate that none of these mechanisms
are strictly applicable to explain the AFI behavior when the transition metal
oxides have polyanions such as (PO4)3-. The symmetry-lowering of the
metal-oxygen complex, to stabilize the polyanion, creates an asymmetric crystal
field for d/f states. In LiFePO4 this field creates completely non-degenerate
Fe-d states which, with negligible p-d and d-d covalent interactions, become
atomically localized to ensure a gap at the Fermi level. Due to large exchange
splitting, high spin state is favored and an antiferromagnetic configuration is
stabilized. For the prototype LiFePO4, independent electron approximation is
good enough to obtain the AFI ground state. Inclusion of additional correlation
measures like Hubbard U simply amplifies the gap and therefore LiFePO4 can be
preferably called as weakly coupled Mott insulator.

of connected events composed of characters, actions, and settings. A coherent
narrative structure is therefore a requisite for a well-formulated narrative --
be it fictional or nonfictional -- for informative and effective communication,
opening up the possibility of a deeper understanding of a narrative by studying
its structural properties. In this paper we present a network-based framework
for modeling and analyzing the structure of a narrative, which is further
expanded by incorporating methods from computational linguistics to utilize the
narrative text. Modeling a narrative as a dynamically unfolding system, we
characterize its progression via the growth patterns of the character network,
and use sentiment analysis and topic modeling to represent the actual content
of the narrative in the form of interaction maps between characters with
associated sentiment values and keywords. This is a network framework advanced
beyond the simple occurrence-based one most often used until now, allowing one
to utilize the unique characteristics of a given narrative to a high degree.
Given the ubiquity and importance of narratives, such advanced network-based
representation and analysis framework may lead to a more systematic modeling
and understanding of narratives for social interactions, expression of human

physicists. How do Einstein's physical strategy and the particle physics
derivations compare? What energy-momentum complex(es) did he use and why? Did
Einstein tie conservation to symmetries, and if so, to which? Einstein used an
identity from his assumed linear coordinate covariance x'= Mx to relate it to
the canonical tensor. Usually he avoided using matter Euler-Lagrange equations
and so was not well positioned to use or reinvent the Herglotz-Mie-Born
understanding that the canonical tensor was conserved due to translation
symmetries, a result with roots in Lagrange, Hamilton and Jacobi. Whereas Mie
and Born were concerned about the canonical tensor's asymmetry, Einstein did
not need to worry because his Entwurf Lagrangian is modeled not so much on
Maxwell's theory as on a scalar theory. As a result, it also has 3 ghosts,
failing a 1920s-30s a priori particle physics stability test with antecedents
in Lagrange's and Dirichlet's stability work.
  This critique of the Entwurf theory can be compared with Einstein's 1915
critique of his Entwurf theory for not admitting rotating coordinates and not
getting Mercury's perihelion right.
  Particle physics also can be useful in the historiography of gravity and

differ from their NLSE analogs. A remarkable difference is the one-sided
development of the triangular spectrum before the rogue wave becomes evident in
time. Also we show that increasing the skewness of the rogue wave results in
increased asymmetry in the triangular Fourier spectra. Additionally, the
triangular spectra of the rogue waves of the KEE begin to develop at earlier
stages of the their development compared to their NLSE analogs, especially for
larger skew angles. This feature may be used to enhance the early warning times
of the rogue waves. However we show that in a chaotic wavefield with many
spectral components the triangular spectra remains as the main attribute as a
universal feature of the typical wavefields produced through modulation
instability and characteristic features of the KEE's analytical rogue wave
spectra may be suppressed in a realistic chaotic wavefield.

analytically for isotoxal star-shaped polygonal voids and rigid inclusions (and
also for the corresponding limit cases of star-shaped cracks and stiffeners),
when loaded through remote inhomogeneous (self-equilibrated, polynomial)
antiplane shear stress in an infinite linear elastic matrix. Usually these
solutions show stress singularities at the inclusion corners. It is shown that
an infinite set of geometries and loading conditions exist for which not only
the singularity is absent, but the stress vanishes ('annihilates') at the
corners. Thus the material, which even without the inclusion corners would have
a finite stress, remains unstressed at these points in spite of the applied
remote load. Moreover, similar conditions are determined in which a star-shaped
crack or stiffener leaves the ambient stress completely unperturbed, thus
reaching a condition of 'quasi-static invisibility'. Stress annihilation and
invisibility define optimal loading modes for the overall strength of a
composite and are useful for designing ultra-resistant materials.
