  Increasing Hydration Level: All-Atoms Molecular Dynamics",,,"10.3390/ma9050319",,"cond-mat.soft","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Water hydrating phospholipid membranes determine their stability and
function, as well as their interaction with other molecules. In this article we
study, using all-atom molecular dynamics simulations, the rotational and
translational dynamical properties of water molecules confined in stacked
phospholipid membranes at different levels of hydration, from poorly hydrated
to a completely hydrated membrane. We find that both the translational and the
reorientation dynamics of water are dramatically slowed down as the hydration
is reduced. Analyzing in details the structure and dynamics of the hydrogen
bond at the interface, we show that both those among water molecules and those
between water and lipids slow down by decreasing the hydration, however the
latter are always slower than the former. By increasing hydration, water
saturates all the possible hydrogen bonds with the lipids and, by further
increase of hydration, the hydrogen bonds among waters becomes the majority.
However, the dynamics of the water-lipids hydrogen bonds becomes up to one
order of magnitude slower than that of the water-water hydrogen bonds, inducing
a large slowing down of the dynamics of the entire system even at large
hydration level.

with a coordinate-wise exact line search. The main ingredient of our algorithm
is the computationally cheap update at each iteration and an easy computation
of the exact step size. Compared to interior point methods, our approach is
much faster in obtaining strong dual bounds. Moreover, no explicit separation
and reoptimization is necessary even if the set of primal constraints is large,
since in our dual approach this is covered by implicitly considering all primal

from polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) molecules in the form of aromatic
infrared bands (AIBs). The spectral variations of the AIBs in this region are
connected to the chemical evolution of the PAH molecules which, in turn,
depends on the local physical conditions. We use the capabilities of SOFIA to
observe a 3.2' x 3.4' region of NGC 7023 at wavelengths that we observe with
high spatial resolution (2.7"") at 3.3 and 11.2 um. We compare the SOFIA images
with existing images of the PAH emission at 8.0 um (Spitzer), emission from
evaporating very small grains (eVSG) extracted from Spitzer-IRS spectral cubes,
the ERE (HST and CFHT), and H_2 (2.12 um). We create maps of the 11.2/3.3 um
ratio to probe the morphology of the PAH size distribution and the 8.0/11.2 um
ratio to probe the PAH ionization. We make use of an emission model and of
vibrational spectra from the NASA Ames PAHdb to translate the 11.2/3.3 um ratio
to PAH sizes. The 11.2/3.3 um map shows the smallest PAH concentrate on the PDR
surface (H_2 and extended red emission) in the NW and South PDR. We estimated
that PAHs in the NW PDR bear, on average, a number of carbon atoms (N_c) of ~70
in the PDR cavity and ~50 at the PDR surface. In the entire nebula, the results
reveal a factor of 2 variation in the size of the PAH. We relate these size
variations to several models for the evolution of the PAH families when they
traverse from the molecular cloud to the PDR. The PAH size map enables us to
follow the photochemical evolution of PAHs in NGC 7023. Small PAHs result from
the photo-evaporation of VSGs as they reach the PDR surface. Inside the PDR
cavity, the PAH abundance drops as the smallest PAH are broken down. The
average PAH size increases in the cavity where only the largest species survive
or are converted into C_60 by photochemical processing.

resources of the millimeter-wave (mm-wave) bands to satisfy demand for
multi-Gbps mobile links anticipated by exponential data traffic growth.
However, given the directional nature of mm-wave links, the feasibility of
mm-wave mobile networks is critically dependent on efficient antenna
beamsteering and a rich inventory of strong LOS (line-of-sight) and NLOS (non
line-of-sight) paths from effective reflectors in the urban environment. In
this paper we report results from detailed angular measurements of 60 GHz links
at an example outdoor pico-cellular site in a mixed-use urban environment
typical of European cities. Our work is the first to systematically analyze the
beamsteering requirements of future mm-wave cellular networks based on real
measurements. Our results reveal that the urban environment provides
substantial opportunities for multi-Gbps mm-wave connectivity, but that the
availability of strong LOS/NLOS links is highly location and
orientation-specific. Our results also show that high speed mm-wave links are
very sensitive to beam misalignment. This has important implications for
practical mm-wave cellular network design: (i) high-precision beamsteering is
required to maintain stable data rates even for quasi-stationary users; and
(ii) providing seamless high speed service in mobility scenarios will be
extremely challenging. Our results thus cast doubt on whether outdoor mm-wave
cellular deployments will be feasible in practice, given the high network
control overhead of meeting such stringent beamsteering requirements.

is consistent with recent theoretical predictions by Ben-Jaffel et al. and
Turner et al. The multi-wavelength photometry indicates a constant transit

they are clustered with bright ones then a physical resolution of ~10 kpc. will
be needed to to distinguish their 21-cm. and QSO Absorption Line(QSOAL)
counterparts from their brighter neighbours, leading to a real possibility of
confusion. But until now such a resolution has not been available in this
context. New Very Large Array (VLA) observations reveal that the
identifications with bright optical objects claimed in previous single-dish
blind HI surveys are often unreliable. For instance 14/36 of our
high-resolution (5 arc sec, 13kpc.) sample have no optical counterparts in the
Digital Sky Survey. This suggests that DDGs might be commonplace after all, and
we go on to re-examine the main arguments that have been used against them.. We
find that the QSOAL argument founders on the aforementioned clustering while
deep CCD surveys have so far covered too small an area to set set strong
constraints on Low Surface Brightness Galaxies (LSBGs). A cosmos filled with
low surface brightness galaxies, dark galaxies and intergalactic gas clouds is
therefore possible.

Magnetic Tunnel Junction (MTJ) can be performed using the high frequency
electrical noise that it delivers under a finite voltage bias. Our method
includes quasi-static hysteresis loop measurements of the MTJ, together with
the field-dependence of its spin wave noise spectra. We rely on an analytical
modeling of the spectra by assuming independent fluctuations of the different
sub-systems of the tunnel junction that are described as macrospin fluctuators.
We illustrate our method on perpendicularly magnetized MgO-based MTJs patterned
in 50*100 nm2 nanopillars. We apply hard axis (in-plane) fields to let the
magnetic thermal fluctuations yield finite conductance fluctuations of the MTJ.
Instead of the free layer fluctuations that are observed to be affected by both
spin-torque and temperature, we use the magnetization fluctuations of the sole
reference layers. Their much stronger anisotropy and their much heavier damping
render them essentially immune to spin-torque. We illustrate our method by
determining current-induced heating of the perpendicularly magnetized tunnel
junction at voltages similar to those used in spin-torque memory applications.
The absolute temperature can be deduced with a precision of +/- 60 K and we can
exclude any substantial heating at the spin-torque switching voltage.

Remarkably, an exact microscopic definition of the heat carriers and their
relaxation times is still missing: phonons, typically regarded as the relevant
excitations for thermal transport, cannot be identified as the heat carriers
when most scattering events conserve momentum and do not dissipate heat flux.
This is the case for two-dimensional or layered materials at room temperature,
or three-dimensional crystals at cryogenic temperatures. In this work we show
that the eigenvectors of the scattering matrix in the Boltzmann equation define
collective phonon excitations, termed here relaxons. These excitations have
well defined relaxation times, directly related to heat flux dissipation, and
provide an exact description of thermal transport as a kinetic theory of the
relaxon gas. We show why Matthiessen's rule is violated, and construct a
procedure for obtaining the mean free paths and relaxation times of the
relaxons. These considerations are general, and would apply also to other
semiclassical transport models, such as the electronic Boltzmann equation. For
heat transport, they remain relevant even in conventional crystals like
silicon, but are of the utmost importance in the case of two-dimensional

because of the backtesting issues of expected shortfall related to
elicitability. In this work we shed a new and fundamental light on optimal
estimation procedures of risk measures in terms of bias. We show that once the
parameters of a model need to be estimated, one has to take additional care
when estimating risks. The typical plug-in approach, for example, introduces a
bias which leads to a systematic underestimation of risk. In this regard, we
introduce a novel notion of unbiasedness to the estimation of risk which is
motivated by economic principles. In general, the proposed concept does not
coincide with the well-known statistical notion of unbiasedness. We show that
an appropriate bias correction is available for many well-known estimators. In
particular, we consider value-at-risk and expected shortfall (tail
value-at-risk). In the special case of normal distributions, closed-formed

interaction, the least bound state in the waveguide dissociates into the
continuum at the resonant magnetic field where the effective one-dimensional
scattering length $a_{\rm 1D}$ diverges. Consequently, the association of atoms
into molecules in the waveguide occurs when the magnetic field is swept
adiabatically across the pole of $a_{\rm 1D}$. In the vicinity of broad
$s$-wave resonances, the resonant magnetic field is nearly independent on the

grains are important for a range of physical and chemical processes. For
example, they dominate the optical depth at short wavelengths and their
surfaces are the sites of many important chemical reactions such as the
formation of water. Based on their aerodynamical properties (i.e., their strong
dynamical coupling with the surrounding gas) it is often assumed that these
small grains are well-mixed with the gas. Our goal is to study the vertical
(re)distribution of grains taking into account settling, turbulent diffusion,
as well as collisions with other dust grains. Assuming a fragmentation-limited
background dust population, we developed a Monte Carlo approach that follows
single monomers as they move through a vertical column of gas and become
incorporated in different aggregates as they undergo sticking and fragmenting
collisions. We find that (sub)micron grains are not necessarily well-mixed
vertically, but can become trapped in a thin layer with a scale-height that is
significantly smaller than that of the gas. This collisional trapping occurs
when the timescale for diffusion is comparable to or longer than the collision
timescale in the midplane and its effect is strongest when the most massive
particles in the size-distribution show significant settling. Based on
simulations and analytical considerations we conclude that for typical
dust-to-gas ratios and turbulence levels, the collisional trapping of small
grains should be a relatively common phenomenon. The absence of trapping could
then indicate a low dust-to-gas ratio, possibly because a large portion of the
dust mass has been removed through radial drift or is locked up in
planetesimals.

and a metallicity range from 0.5 dex down to -1.2 dex and study the behaviour
of Teff and [Fe/H] on the spectral indices. We find a tight relation between
Teff and the $\rm ^{12}CO(2-0)$ band with a dispersion of 95 K as well as
between Teff and the $\rm ^{12}CO(3-1)$ with a dispersion of 120 K. We do not
find any dependence of these relations on the metallicity of the star, making
them relation attractive for galactic Bulge studies. This relation is also not
sensitive to the spectral resolution allowing to apply this relation in a more
general way.
  We also found a correlation between the combination of the NaI, CaI and the
$\rm ^{12}CO$ band with the metallicity of the star. However this relation is
only valid for sub-solar metallicities. We show that low-resolution spectra
provide a powerful tool to obtain effective temperatures of M giants. We show

profiles from those exploited in the literature and allow for a variation of

the stiffer the EoS the steeper a decrease with density of the effective pion
gap is required. Results are compared with previously obtained ones for the HDD
EoS for which $M_{\rm max} =2.06~M_{\odot}$. The cooling of the compact star in

without experiencing any dispersion or dissipation. However, if the medium has
a non-zero shear viscosity $\eta$ , gravitational waves will be dissipated at a
rate proportional to $G \,\eta$. We constrain dark matter and dark energy
models with non-zero shear viscosity by calculating the dissipation of
gravitational waves from GW150914 which propagate over a distance of $410\, $
Mpc through the dissipative fluid and comparing the data with the theoretical
prediction. This provides a proof-of-principle demonstration of the fact that
future observations gravitational waves at LIGO have the potential of better
constraining the viscosity of dark matter and dark energy.

typically cover a large field of view, making them interesting sensors for

been dominated by hand-crafted features and boosted classifiers, potentially
losing performance due to suboptimal design choices. We propose a Convolutional
Neural Network (CNN) based detector for this task. We show how to effectively
apply CNNs for detection in 2D range data, and propose a depth preprocessing
step and voting scheme that significantly improve CNN performance. We
demonstrate our approach on wheelchairs and walkers, obtaining state of the art

limits the detector to these two classes, though. We provide a ROS node for our

the general flavor and CP structure of the models. Even though the A-terms can

Gaus-sian Process (GP) to approximate an objective function known at a finite
number of observation points and sequentially adds new points which maximize
the Expected Improvement criterion according to the GP. The important factor
that controls the efficiency of EGO is the GP covariance function (or kernel)
which should be chosen according to the objective function. Traditionally, a
pa-rameterized family of covariance functions is considered whose parameters
are learned through statistical procedures such as maximum likelihood or
cross-validation. However, it may be questioned whether statistical procedures
for learning covariance functions are the most efficient for optimization as
they target a global agreement between the GP and the observations which is not
the ultimate goal of optimization. Furthermore, statistical learning procedures
are computationally expensive. The main alternative to the statistical learning
of the GP is self-adaptation, where the algorithm tunes the kernel parameters
based on their contribution to objective function improvement. After
questioning the possibility of self-adaptation for kriging based optimizers,
this paper proposes a novel approach for tuning the length-scale of the GP in
EGO: At each iteration, a small ensemble of kriging models structured by their
length-scales is created. All of the models contribute to an iterate in an
EGO-like fashion. Then, the set of models is densified around the model whose
length-scale yielded the best iterate and further points are produced.
Numerical experiments are provided which motivate the use of many
length-scales. The tested implementation does not perform better than the
classical EGO algorithm in a sequential context but show the potential of the
approach for parallel implementations.

target space has generally been assumed to be equal to R^d for some d $\ge$ 1.
We focus here on the extendability problem for general ordered pairs

holds, in terms of a newly introduced notion that we call pliability.
Pliability happens to be related to rigidity as defined by Bryant an Hsu. We
exploit this relation in order to provide examples of non-pliable Carnot
groups, that is, Carnot groups so that the Whitney extension property does not

affine systems in order to test the pliability of a Carnot group. In

as matching the continuum radio emission to the host galaxy. Radio images come
from the FIRST and ATLAS surveys, while matches to potential hosts are
performed with infrared imaging from WISE and SWIRE. The first twelve months of
classification yielded more than 1 million classifications of more than 60,000
sources. For images with at least 75% consensus by the volunteer classifiers,
the accuracy is comparable to visual inspection by the expert science team.
Based on mid-infrared colors, the hosts associated with radio emission are
primarily a mixture of elliptical galaxies, QSOs, and LIRGs, which are in good
agreement with previous studies. The full catalog of radio lobes and their host
galaxies will measure the relative populations of host types as a function of
radio morphology and power. Radio Galaxy Zoo has also been an effective method
for detecting extremely rare objects, such as HyMORs and giant radio galaxies.
Results from the project are being used to train automatic algorithms for host
matching for use in future large continuum surveys such as EMU, as well as
establishing roles for citizen science in projects such as the SKA.

performance scalability on Chip Multiprocessors(CMP's) are Irregular
applications. Such applications have very little computation and unpredictable
memory access patterns making them memory-bound in contrast to compute-bound
applications. Since the gap between processor and memory performance continues
to exist, difficulty to hide and decrease this gap is one of the important
factors which results in poor performance of these applications on CMP's.
  The goal of this thesis is to overcome many such challenges posed during
performance acceleration of an irregular graph algorithm called Triad Census.
We accelerated the Triad Census algorithm on two significantly different Chip
Multiprocessors: Dual-socket Intel Xeon Multicore (8 hardware threads per
socket) and 240-processor core NVIDIA Tesla C1060 GPGPU(128 hardware threads
per core).
  The experimental results obtained on Intel Multicore Xeon system shows
performance speedups (w.r.t baseline sequential) of maximum 56x , average 33x
and minimum 8.3x for real world graph data sets. On NVIDIA Tesla C1060 GPGPU,
we were able to match almost equally the Multicore results - 58.4x maximum,
32.8x average and 4.2x minimum speedups w.r.t baseline sequential. In terms of
raw performance, for the graph data set called Patents network, our results on
Intel Xeon Multicore(16 hw threads) were 1.27x times faster than previous
results on Cray XMT(16 hw threads) while results achieved on GPGPU were
comparatively slower(0.72x). To the best of our knowledge, this algorithm has
only been accelerated on supercomputer class computer named Cray XMT and no
work exists that demonstrates performance evaluation and comparison of this
algorithm on relatively lower-cost Multicore and GPGPU based platforms.

concentrated on an unknown subset of the Euclidean space. A random matrix is
introduced whose columns are independent copies of the random vector and for
which the number of columns is the number of data points in the data set. The
approach is based on the use of (i) the multidimensional kernel-density
estimation method for estimating the probability distribution of the random
matrix, (ii) a MCMC method for generating realizations for the random matrix,
(iii) the diffusion-maps approach for discovering and characterizing the

representation of the random matrix, which is constructed using the
diffusion-maps vectors associated with the first eigenvalues of the transition
matrix relative to the given data set. The convergence aspects of the proposed
methodology are analyzed and a numerical validation is explored through three

robust to noise levels and data complexity as well as to the intrinsic

Background (CMB) were recently measured by the Planck satellite. The most
straightforward interpretation leads to a direct detection of our peculiar
velocity $\beta$, consistent with the measurement of the well-known dipole. In
this paper we discuss the assumptions behind such interpretation. We show that
Doppler-like couplings appear from two effects: our peculiar velocity and a
second order large-scale effect due to the dipolar part of the gravitational
potential. We find that the two effects are exactly degenerate but only if we
assume second-order initial conditions from single-field Inflation. Thus,
detecting a discrepancy in the value of $\beta$ from the dipole and the Doppler
couplings implies the presence of a primordial non-Gaussianity. We also show
that aberration-like signals likewise arise from two independent effects: our
peculiar velocity and lensing due to a first order large-scale dipolar
gravitational potential, independently on Gaussianity of the initial
conditions. In general such effects are not degenerate and so a discrepancy
between the measured $\beta$ from the dipole and aberration could be accounted
for by a dipolar gravitational potential. Only through a fine-tuning of the
radial profile of the potential it is possible to have a complete degeneracy
with a boost effect. Finally we discuss that we also expect other signatures
due to integrated second order terms, which may be further used to disentangle
this scenario from a simple boost.

fundamental issues such as thermalisation and black-hole formation, while its

engineer the evolution so as to maximise the generation of entanglement. The
resulting volume law growth of entanglement is certified by constructing a
second chip, which simultaneously measures the entanglement between multiple

security definitions for two possible scenarios: (i) when a threshold of
servers succeed with high enough probability (worst-case) and (ii) when the
average of the success probability of all the servers is above a threshold
(average-case). We also motivate the study of confidentiality of the outsourced
message. We give $\mathsf{M}\mbox{-}\mathsf{PoR}$ schemes which are secure
under both these security definitions and provide reasonable confidentiality
guarantees even when there is no restriction on the computational power of the
servers. We also show how classical statistical techniques used by Paterson,
Stinson and Upadhyay (Journal of Mathematical Cryptology: 7(3)) can be extended

successful extraction. We also look at one specific instantiation of our
construction when instantiated with the unconditionally secure version of the

globular clusters that are among the most distant and/or highly reddened in the
Galaxy's globular cluster system. We observed R ~ 2000 spectra in the
wavelength interval 456-586 nm and applied full spectrum fitting technique. We
compared the mean abundances of all clusters with previous work and with field
stars. We used the relation between mean metallicity and horizontal branch
morphology defined by all clusters to select outliers for discussion. We find
our metallicities are comparable to those derived from high-resolution data to
within sigma = 0.08 dex over the interval -2.5 < [Fe/H] < 0.0. We also find
that the distribution of [Mg/Fe] and [alpha/Fe] with [Fe/H] for the 51 clusters

the following clusters have been included in a large sample of homogeneous
stellar spectroscopic observations and metallicity derivation: BH 176, Djorg 2,
Pal 10, NGC 6426, Lynga 7, and Terzan 8. In particular, only photometric
metallicities were available previously for the first three clusters, and the
available metallicity for NGC 6426 was based on integrated spectroscopy and
photometry. Two other clusters, HP 1 and NGC 6558, are confirmed as candidates
for the oldest globular clusters in the Milky Way. The technique used here can
also be applied to globular cluster systems in nearby galaxies with current
instruments and to distant galaxies with the advent of ELTs.

Indeed, it is suspected that the gravitational field might be nonminimally

Einstein-Yang-Mills theory with a cosmological constant. Imposing spherical
symmetry and staticity for the spacetime and a magnetic Wu-Yang ansatz for the
Yang-Mills field, we find expressions for the solutions of the theory. Further
imposing constraints on the nonminimal parameters, we find a family of exact
solutions of the theory depending on five parameters, namely, two nonminimal
parameters, the cosmological constant, the magnetic charge, and the mass. These
solutions represent magnetic monopoles and black holes in magnetic monopoles
with de Sitter, Minkowskian, and anti-de Sitter asymptotics, depending on the
sign and value of the cosmological constant $\Lambda$. We classify completely
the family of solutions with respect to the number and the type of horizons and
show that the spacetime solutions can have, at most, four horizons. For
particular sets of the parameters, these horizons can become double, triple,
and quadruple. For instance, for a positive cosmological constant $\Lambda$,
there is a critical $\Lambda_c$ for which the solution admits a quadruple
horizon, evocative of the $\Lambda_c$ that appears for a given energy density
in both the Einstein static and Eddington-Lema\^{\i}tre dynamical universes. As

important implications of MOND and provides a special context to test
Milgromian dynamics. Here, we study the rotation curves (RCs) of 18 spiral

successfully remedy the overestimation of rotation velocities in 80\% of the

outer part of the RCs. We compare the implied external field with the
gravitational field for non-negligible nearby sources of each individual galaxy
and find that in many cases it is compatible with the EFE within the
uncertainties. We therefore argue that in the framework of Milgromian dynamics,
one can constrain the gravitational field induced from the environment of

an even number of real (or an arbitrary number of complex) Proca fields. To
establish it, we start by showing that a test, complex Proca field can form
bound states, with real frequency, around Kerr BHs: stationary Proca clouds.
These states exist at the threshold of superradiance. It was conjectured in
arXiv:1403.2757, that the existence of such clouds at the linear level implies
the existence of a new family of BH solutions at the non-linear level. We
confirm this expectation and explicitly construct examples of such Kerr black
holes with Proca hair (KBHsPH). For a single complex Proca field, these BHs
form a countable number of families with three continuous parameters (ADM mass,
ADM angular momentum and Noether charge). They branch off from the Kerr
solutions that can support stationary Proca clouds and reduce to Proca stars
when the horizon size vanishes. We present the domain of existence of one
family of KBHsPH, as well as its phase space in terms of ADM quantities. Some
physical properties of the solutions are discussed; in particular, and in
contrast with Kerr BHs with scalar hair, some spacetime regions can be
counter-rotating with respect to the horizon. We further establish a
no-Proca-hair theorem for static, spherically symmetric BHs but allowing the
complex Proca field to have a harmonic time dependence, which shows BHs with
Proca hair in this model require rotation and have no static limit. KBHsPH are
also disconnected from Kerr-Newman BHs with a real, massless vector field.

(the so-called $\Omega\Gamma-$limit) in the formation of Population III stars.
We performed one-dimensional stellar evolution simulations of mass-accreting
zero-metallicity protostars at a very high rate ($\dot{M} \sim
10^{-3}~\mathrm{M_\odot~yr^{-1}}$) and dealt with stellar rotation as a
separate post-process. The protostar would reach the Keplerian rotation very
soon after the onset of mass accretion, but mass accretion would continue as
stellar angular momentum is transferred outward to the accretion disk by
viscous stress. The protostar envelope expands rapidly when the stellar mass
reaches $5\sim7~\mathrm{M_\odot}$ and the Eddington factor sharply increases.
This makes the protostar rotate critically at a rate that is significantly
below the Keplerian value (i.e., the $\Omega\Gamma-$limit). The resultant
positive gradient of the angluar velocity in the boundary layer between the
protostar and the Keplerian disk prohibits angular momentum transport from the
star to the disk, and consequently further rapid mass accretion. This would
prevent the protostar from growing significantly beyond $20 -
40~\mathrm{M_\odot}$. Another important consequence of the $\Omega\Gamma-$limit
is that the protostar can remain fairly compact ($R \lesssim
50~\mathrm{R_\odot}$) and avoid a fluffy structure ($R \gtrsim
500~\mathrm{R_\odot}$) that is usually found with a very high mass accretion
rate. This effect would make the protostar less prone to binary interactions
during the protostar phase. Although our analysis is based on Pop III protostar
models, this role of the $\Omega\Gamma-$limit would be universal in the
formation process of massive stars, regardless of metallicity.

measure the evolution of the mass, angular momentum, magnetic field, and
turbulence around the star. We consider effects of two processes that strongly
affect the magnetic transfer of angular momentum, both of which are based on
turbulent reconnection: the first, ""reconnection diffusion"", removes the
magnetic flux from the disk, the other involves the change of the magnetic
field's topology, but does not change the absolute value of the magnetic flux
through the disk. We demonstrate that for the first mechanism, turbulence
causes a magnetic flux transport outward from the inner disk to the ambient
medium, thus decreasing the coupling of the disk to the ambient material. A
similar effect is achieved through the change of the magnetic field's topology
from a split monopole configuration to a dipole configuration. We explore how
both mechanisms prevent the catastrophic loss of disk angular momentum and
compare both above turbulent reconnection mechanisms with alternative
mechanisms from the literature.

superconductivity, i.e., charge carriers (metal) and pairing interaction (QSL),
the proposed setup naturally lands on the parameter regime conducive to a
controlled theoretical prediction. Moreover, the proposed setup allows us to
""customize"" electron-electron interaction imprinted on the metallic layer. The

gauge-field description of spin frustration. Assuming the metallic layer forms
an isotropic single Fermi pocket, we predict that the coupling between the

topological odd-parity pairing. We further present guiding principles for
materializing the suitable heterostructure using ab initio calculations and
describe the band structure we predict for the case of

more intense star formation. To cover a large range of conditions we consider

dynamo theory is in agreement with the origin of the observed correlation
between the far-infrared (FIR) luminosity L_FIR and the radio luminosity
L_radio. Our model reproduces this correlation well at z=0. We extrapolate the
FIR-radio correlation to higher redshift and predict a time evolution with a
significant deviation from its present-day appearance already at z~2 for a gas

the radio luminosity with redshift which is caused by the increase of cosmic
ray energy losses at high z. The result is an increase of the ratio between

condensation of disclinations and therefore restore the rotation symmetry. Such

gauge theories. In this context, confined phases with strongly fluctuating
gauge fields seem to be irrelevant to the physics of topological phases. For
example, the low-energy theory of the two-dimensional (2D) toric code model
(i.e. the deconfined phase of $\mathbb{Z}_2$ gauge theory) is a $U(1)\times
U(1)$ Chern-Simons theory in which gauge charges (i.e., $e$ and $m$ particles)
are deconfined and the gauge fields are gapped, while the confined phase is
topologically trivial. In this paper, we point out a new route to constructing
exotic 3D gapped fermionic phases in a confining phase of a gauge theory.
Starting from a parton construction with strongly fluctuating compact
$U(1)\times U(1)$ gauge fields, we construct gapped phases of interacting
fermions by condensing two linearly independent bosonic composite particles
consisting of partons and $U(1)\times U(1)$ magnetic monopoles. This can be
regarded as a 3D generalization of the 2D Bais-Slingerland condensation
mechanism. Charge fractionalization results from a Debye-H\""uckel-like
screening cloud formed by the condensed composite particles. Within our general
framework, we explore two aspects of symmetry-enriched 3D Abelian topological
phases. First, we construct a new fermionic state of matter with time-reversal
symmetry and $\Theta\neq \pi$, the fractional topological insulator. Second, we
generalize the notion of anyonic symmetry of 2D Abelian topological phases to
the charge-loop excitation symmetry ($\mathsf{Charles}$) of 3D Abelian
topological phases. We show that line twist defects, which realize
$\mathsf{Charles}$ transformations, exhibit non-Abelian fusion properties.

fundamental assumption about the source surface -- the field is normally
required to purely radial at the source surface. Our model rests on the fact
that a change in the radial field strength at the source surface is a change in
the field line density. Surrounding field lines must move laterally in order to
accommodate this field line density change. As the outward wind velocity drags
field lines past the source surface this lateral component of motion produces a
tilt implying there is a transverse component to the field.
  An analytic method of calculating the lateral translation speed of the field
lines is developed. We apply the technique to an interval of approximately two
Carrington rotations at the beginning of 2011 using 2-h averages of data from
the Helioseismic Magnetic Imager instrument on the Solar Dynamics Observatory

dominated on a global scale by the effects of high latitude concentrations of

demonstrated that the mapping between observable and total mass, as well as the

[OIV] emitters. These results together with the radio-quiet nature of the
Seyferts support the scenario that the bulk of MIR emission is emitted by dust
in the polar region and not by the torus, which would demand a new paradigm for
the infrared emission structure in AGN. The current low detection rate of polar
dust in the AGN of the MIR atlas is explained by the lack of sufficient high
quality MIR data and the requirement for the orientation, NLR strength and
distance of the AGN. The James-Webb Space Telescope will enable much deeper
nuclear MIR studies with comparable angular resolution, allowing us to resolve
the polar emission and surroundings in most of the nearby AGN.

effect. However, the ATE implicitly assumes a homogenous treatment effect even
amongst individuals with different characteristics. In this paper, we mainly
focus on assessing the treatment effect heterogeneity, which has important
implications in designing the optimal individual treatment regimens and in
policy making. The treatment benefit rate (TBR) and treatment harm rate (THR)
have been defined to characterize the magnitude of heterogeneity for binary
outcomes. When the outcomes are continuous, we extend the definitions of the
TBR and THR to compare the difference between potential outcomes with a
pre-specified level c. Unlike the ATE, these rates involve the joint
distribution of the potential outcomes and can not be identified without
further assumptions even in randomized clinical trials. In this article, we
assume the potential outcomes are independent conditional on the observed
covariates and an unmeasured latent variable. Under this assumption, we prove
the identification of the TBR and THR in non-separable (generalized) linear
models for both continuous and binary outcomes. We then propose estimators and
derive their asymptotic distributions. In the simulation studies, we implement
our proposed methods to assess the performance of our estimators and carry out
a sensitive analysis for different underlying distribution for the latent
variable. Finally, we illustrate the proposed methods in two randomized

pre-determined categories. Designing image classification algorithms that
exhibit robustness to acquisition noise and image distortions, particularly
when the available training data are insufficient to learn accurate models, is
a significant challenge. This dissertation explores the development of
discriminative models for robust image classification that exploit underlying
signal structure, via probabilistic graphical models and sparse signal
representations.
  Probabilistic graphical models are widely used in many applications to
approximate high-dimensional data in a reduced complexity set-up. Learning
graphical structures to approximate probability distributions is an area of
active research. Recent work has focused on learning graphs in a discriminative
manner with the goal of minimizing classification error. In the first part of
the dissertation, we develop a discriminative learning framework that exploits
the complementary yet correlated information offered by multiple
representations (or projections) of a given signal/image. Specifically, we
propose a discriminative tree-based scheme for feature fusion by explicitly
learning the conditional correlations among such multiple projections in an
iterative manner. Experiments reveal the robustness of the resulting graphical
model classifier to training insufficiency.

investigate the potential of this approach for Bernoulli-data. GDF-values for

inconsistently sensitive to the number of data points perturbed simultaneously,

variance is a modest multiple of the square of the point estimate, yielding a
relative error property similar to that of saddlepoint approximations. On a

We show that monogamy inequality of multi-qudit entanglement in terms of SCREN

a controversial topic. The main question is whether spin or orbital
fluctuations are responsible for the pairing mechanism. To solve this problem,
a crucial clue can be obtained by examining the remarkable enhancement of
magnetic neutron scattering signals appearing in a superconducting phase. The
enhancement is called spin resonance for a spin fluctuation model, in which
their energy is restricted below twice the superconducting gap value (2Ds),
whereas larger energies are possible in other models such as an orbital
fluctuation model. Here we report the doping dependence of low-energy magnetic
excitation spectra in Ba1-xKxFe2As2 for 0.5<x<0.84 studied by inelastic neutron
scattering. We find that the behavior of the spin resonance dramatically
changes from optimum to overdoped regions. Strong resonance peaks are observed
clearly below 2Ds in the optimum doping region, while they are absent in the
overdoped region. Instead, there is a transfer of spectral weight from energies
below 2Ds to higher energies, peaking at values of 3Ds for x = 0.84. These
results suggest a reduced impact of magnetism on Cooper pair formation in the
overdoped region.

of several intensity enhancements bridged by generally weak emissions, with
brightness temperatures ($T_B$) varying from ~10,000~K to ~20,000 K. Locations
of microwave intensity enhancements along the structure remain relatively fixed

emitting electrons is affected by the large scale magnetic configuration of the
twisted flux rope. Wavelet analysis shows a pronounced 2-min period of the
microwave $T_B$ variation during the pre-impulsive stage of interest. The
period agrees well with that reported for AIA sunward-contracting loops and
upward ejective plasmoids (suggested to be reconnection outflows). This
suggests that both periodicities are controlled by the same reconnection

filtering, we need to design non-uniform filter banks (NUFB), which may lead to
better performances and reduced hardware complexity when compared to uniform
filter bank. NUFB satisfying linear phase property for all the constituent
filters, are desirable in applications such as speech and image processing and
in communication. This paper proposes a novel design of non-uniform modified
discrete fourier transform filter bank (MDFT FB). Here, each non-uniform
channel is obtained by merging the nearby channels of a uniform MDFT FB. The
reported works of non-uniform cosine modulated filter banks (CMFBs) do not
satisfy linear phase property for all the constituent filters. In this work, we
introduce the design of a non-uniform MDFT FB which satisfies linear phase
property for all the constituent filters. The proposed design of the
non-uniform MDFT FB is checked utilizing the alias cancellation among the
channels, distortion and flatness condition of the channels. A condition is
derived to find the channels when merged with adjacent channels, will cause
aliasing in M channels. In the design and implementation of the proposed
non-uniform MDFT FB, the structure of the uniform MDFT filter bank is preserved
and hence all the advantages of MDFT FB over the DFT filter bank, are
guaranteed. Hence without increasing the design complexity, the non-uniform
MDFT FB is designed.

found in the coarse-grained ionic liquid model systems. In our ionic liquid
model systems, cations are modeled as dimers with positive charge, while anions
are modeled as monomers with negative charge, respectively. To study the effect
of the charge distributions on the cations, two ionic liquid models with
different charge distributions are used and the model with neutral charge is
also considered as a counterpart. To reveal the heterogeneous dynamics in the
model systems, we examine spatial distributions of displacement and time
distributions of exchange and persistence times. All the models show
significant increase of the dynamic heterogeneity as the temperature is
lowered. The dynamic heterogeneity is quantified via the well-known four-point
susceptibility which measures the fluctuation of a time correlation function.
The dynamic correlation length is calculated by fitting the dynamic structure
factor, S4(k,t), with Ornstein-Zernike form at the time scale at which the
dynamic heterogeneity reaches the maximum value. Obtained time and length
scales exhibit a power law relation at the low temperatures, similar to various
supercooled liquid models. Especially, the charged model systems show unusual
crossover behaviors which are not observed in the uncharged model system. We
ascribe the crossover behavior to the enhanced cage effect caused by charges on
the particles.

investigate the effects of compressibility on the atmospheric dynamics by
solving the standard Euler equations. This is done by means of a series of
simulations performed in the framework of the equatorial beta-plane
approximation using the finite volume shock-capturing code RAMSES. At low
resolution, we recover the classical results described in the literature: we
find a strong and steady supersonic equatorial jet of a few km/s that displays
no signature of shocks. We next show that the jet zonal velocity depends
significantly on the grid meridional resolution. When that resolution is fine
enough to properly resolve the jet, the latter is subject to a Kelvin-Helmholtz
instability. The jet zonal mean velocity displays regular oscillations with a
typical timescale of few days and a significant amplitude of about 15% of the
jet velocity. We also find compelling evidence for the development of a
vertical shear instability at pressure levels of a few bars. It seems to be
responsible for an increased downward kinetic energy flux, significantly
affecting the temperature of the deep atmosphere, and appears to act as a form
of drag on the equatorial jet. This instability also creates velocity
fluctuations that propagate upward and steepen into weak shocks at pressure
levels of a few mbars. We conclude that hot Jupiter equatorial jets are
potentially unstable to both a barotropic Kelvin-Helmholtz instability and a
vertical shear instability. Upon confirmation using more realistic models, both
instabilities could result in significant time variability of the atmospheric
winds, may provide a small scale dissipation mechanism in the flow, and might
have consequences for the internal evolution of hot Jupiters.

quantization and the Coulomb potential energy. Absorption spectra have the
shoulders, asymmetric peaks and logarithmic peaks, coming from the band-edge
states of parabolic dispersions, the constant-energy loops and the saddle
points, respectively. The initial forbidden excitation region is only revealed
in even-layer AA stacking systems. Optical gaps and special structures can be
generated by an electric field. The delta-function-like structures in
magneto-optical spectra, which present the single, twin and double peaks, are
associated with the symmetric, asymmetric and splitting Landau-level energy
spectra, respectively. The single peaks due to the non-tilted Dirac cones
exhibit the nearly uniform intensity. The AAB stacking possesses more
absorption structures, compared to the other stackings. The diverse
magneto-optical selection rules are mainly determined by the well-behaved,

neural code. At one extreme, it has been argued that neurons encode information
in relatively slow changes of individual spikes arriving ""rates codes"" and the
irregularity in the spike trains reflects noise in the system, while in the
other extreme this irregularity is the temporal codes thus the precise timing
of every spike carries additional information about the input. It is known that
in the estimation of Shannon information the patterns and temporal structures
are taken into account, while the rate code is determined by firing rate. We
compare these types of codes for binary Information Sources which model encoded
spike-trains. Assuming that the information transmitted by a neuron is governed
by uncorrelated stochastic process or by process with a memory we compare the
information transmission rates carried by such spike-trains with their firing
rates. We showed that the crucial role in the relation between information and
firing rates is played by a quantity which we call ""jumping"" parameter. It
corresponds to the probabilities of transitions from no-spike-state to the
spike-state and vice versa. For low values of jumping parameter the quotient of
information and firing rates is monotonically decreasing function of firing
rate, thus there is straightforward, one-to-one, relation between temporal and
rate codes. On the contrary, it turns out that for large enough jumping
parameter this quotient is non-monotonic function of firing rate and it
exhibits a global maximum, in this case optimal firing rate exists. Moreover,
there is no one-to-one relation between information and firing rates, so the
temporal and rate codes differ qualitatively. This leads to the observation

Here, we demonstrate the strongly modulated ambipolar characteristics of
few-layer black phosphorus in oxygen. Pure oxygen exposure can dramatically
decrease the electron mobility of black phosphorus without degrading the hole
transport. The transport characteristics can be nearly recovered upon annealing
in Argon. This reveals that oxygen molecules are physisorbed on black
phosphorus. In contrast, oxygen exposure upon light illumination exhibits a
significant attenuation for both electron and hole transport, originating from
the photoactivated oxidation of black phosphorus, which is corroborated by in
situ X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy characterization. Our findings clarify
the predominant role of oxygen in modulating ambipolar characteristics of black
phosphorus, thereby providing deeper insight to the design of black phosphorus
based complementary electronics.

We show that the dynamics of monogamy scores corresponding to negativity and

parameter, which is in contrast to the monotonic decay of monogamy scores when

quantify the persistence of monogamy against noise via a characteristic value
of the noise parameter, and show that depolarizing noise destroys monogamy of
quantum correlation faster compared to other noisy channels. We demonstrate
that the negativity monogamy score is more robust than the quantum discord
monogamy score, when the noise is of the phase-damping type. We also
investigate the variation of monogamy with increasing noise for arbitrary

created due to the presence of a single scalar field in the dynamical process.
Also such an interesting scenario has vivid implications in cosmology when

Analysis (KECA) algorithm: the optimization of the kernel decomposition and the

sorting of the importance of kernel eigenvectors by entropy instead of by
variance as in Kernel Principal Components Analysis. In this work, we propose
an extension of the KECA method, named Optimized KECA (OKECA), that directly
extracts the optimal features retaining most of the data entropy by means of
compacting the information in very few features (often in just one or two). The
proposed method produces features which have higher expressive power. In
particular, it is based on the Independent Component Analysis (ICA) framework,
and introduces an extra rotation to the eigen-decomposition, which is optimized
via gradient ascent search. This maximum entropy preservation suggests that
OKECA features are more efficient than KECA features for density estimation. In
addition, a critical issue in both methods is the selection of the kernel
parameter since it critically affects the resulting performance. Here we
analyze the most common kernel length-scale selection criteria. Results of both
methods are illustrated in different synthetic and real problems. Results show
that 1) OKECA returns projections with more expressive power than KECA, 2) the
most successful rule for estimating the kernel parameter is based on maximum
likelihood, and 3) OKECA is more robust to the selection of the length-scale
parameter in kernel density estimation.

upflows. The BPs in the TR have a spatial scale of about 350$-$580 km and
lifetime of more than several tens of minutes. They are located at stronger
magnetic structures in the filament channel, with magnetic flux of about
10$^{17}$$-$10$^{18}$ Mx. Quasi-periodic brightenings and upflows are observed
in the BPs and the period is about 4$-$5 min. The BP and the associated
jet-like upflow comprise a ""tadpole-shaped"" structure. The upflows move along
bright filament threads and their directions are almost parallel to the spine
of the filament. The upflows initiated from the BPs with opposite polarity
magnetic fields have opposite directions. The velocity of the upflows in plane
of sky is about 5$-$50 km s$^{-1}$. The emission line of Si IV 1402.77 {\AA} at
the locations of upflows exhibits obvious blueshifts of about 5$-$30 km
s$^{-1}$, and the line profile is broadened with the width of more than 20 km
s$^{-1}$. The BPs seem to be the bases of filament threads and the upflows are
able to convey mass for the dynamic balance of the filament. The
""counter-streaming"" flows in previous observations may be caused by the
propagation of bi-directional upflows initiated from opposite polarity magnetic
fields. We suggest that quasi-periodic brightenings of BPs and quasi-periodic
upflows result from small-scale oscillatory magnetic reconnections, which are
modulated by solar p-mode waves.

and [O IV]. The IR luminosity due to star-formation (SF) and the intrinsic AGN
bolometric luminosity are shown to be strongly related to the IR line
luminosity. Variations of these relations with different AGN fractions are
investigated, showing that the relation dispersions are mainly due to different
AGN relative contribution within the galaxy. Extrapolating these local
relations between line and SF or AGN luminosities to higher redshifts, by means
of recent Herschel galaxy evolution results, we then obtain mid- and far-IR
line luminosity functions useful to estimate how many star-forming galaxies and
AGN we expect to detect in the different lines at different redshifts and
luminosities with future IR facilities (e.g., JWST, SPICA).

experimental results are puzzling and anomalous; they resemble high Tc and
unconventional superconductors. Using a two orbital model of Usui, Suzuki and
Kuroki we show that the uniform low density free fermi sea in \laofh is
\textit{unstable towards formation of next nearest neighbor Bi-S-Bi diagonal
valence bond} (charge -2e Cooper pair) and their \textit{Wigner
crystallization}. Instability to this novel state of matter is caused by
unscreened nearest neighbor coulomb repulsions (V $\sim$ 1 eV) and a hopping
pattern with sulfur mediated diagonal next nearest neighbor Bi-S-Bi hopping t'
$\sim$ 0.88 eV, larger than nearest neighbor Bi-Bi hopping, t $\sim$ 0.16 eV.
Wigner crystal of Cooper pairs quantum melt for doping around x = 0.5 and
stabilize certain resonating valence bond states and superconductivity. We
study few variational RVB states and suggest that \bis2 family members are
latent high Tc superconductors, but challenged by competing orders and fragile
nature of manybody states sustained by unscreened Coulomb forces. One of our
superconducting state has d$_{xy}$ symmetry and a gap. We also predict 2d
\textit{Bose metal or vortex liquid} normal state, as charge -2e valence bonds
survive in the normal state.

increasing dimensions of the architecture, the time complexity of this approach
becomes enormous. Also, greedy pre-training of the layers often turns
detrimental by over-training a layer causing it to lose harmony with the rest

pre-training deep networks on multi-core machines has been proposed. Different
layers are trained by parallel threads running on different cores with regular
synchronization. Thus the pre-training process becomes faster and chances of
over-training are reduced. This is experimentally validated using a stacked

$(2,2,9g-4)$-colorable. Moreover, these graphs are also
$(0,0,O(\sqrt{g}),O(\sqrt{g}))$-colorable and

  We make use of a triplet loss because this has been shown to be most
effective for ranking problems.
  However, training in previous works can be prohibitively expensive due to the
fact that optimization is directly performed on the triplet space, where the
number of possible triplets for training is cubic in the number of training
examples.
  To address this issue, we propose to formulate high-order binary codes
learning as a multi-label classification problem by explicitly separating
learning into two interleaved stages.
  To solve the first stage, we design a large-scale high-order binary codes
inference algorithm to reduce the high-order objective to a standard binary
quadratic problem such that graph cuts can be used to efficiently infer the
binary code which serve as the label of each training datum.
  In the second stage we propose to map the original image to compact binary
codes via carefully designed deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and the
hashing function fitting can be solved by training binary CNN classifiers.
  An incremental/interleaved optimization strategy is proffered to ensure that
these two steps are interactive with each other during training for better
accuracy.
  We conduct experiments on several benchmark datasets, which demonstrate both
improved training time (by as much as two orders of magnitude) as well as
producing state-of-the-art hashing for various retrieval tasks.

during the merger can cause the appearance of a naked singularity. In case some
matter, in the form of a small accretion disk, is present in the surroundings
of the black hole system then the emitted luminosity during the merger would
allow to distinguish the scenario where the naked singularity forms from the
scenario where the horizon exists at all times. In fact the emitted luminosity
spectrum would be much higher in the case where a naked singularity forms as
opposed to the `pure' black hole case. We suggest that the presence of such a

regime is not reached yet. We show that the maximum growth rate is a decreasing

mystery. The seed of these magnetic fields has been attributed to physical
process in the early universe. In this work we provide a mechanism for the
generation of a primordial magnetic field in the early universe via the Weibel
instability in the quark gluon plasma. The Weibel instability occurs in the
plasma if there is an anisotropy in the particle distribution function of the
particles. In early universe, the velocity anisotropy required for Weibel
instability to operate is generated in the quark gluon plasma by the collapse
of closed $Z(3)$ domain walls that arise in the deconfined phase of the QCD
(above $T\sim 200$ MeV). Such large domains can arise in the context of certain
low energy scale inflationary models. The closed domains undergo supersonic
collapse and the velocity anisotropy is generated in the shocks produced in the
wake of the collapsing domain walls. This results in a two stream Weibel
instability in the ultra-relativistic quark gluon plasma. The instability in
turn generates strong magnetic fields in the plasma. We find that the field
strengths generated can be comparable to the equipartition energy density at
the QCD scale which is of the order of $10^{18}$ G.

and the determinants of flight deviations is of great importance in air traffic
management. In this paper we perform an in depth investigation of the
statistical properties of planned and realized air traffic on the German
airspace during a 28 day periods, corresponding to an AIRAC cycle. We find that
realized trajectories are on average shorter than planned ones and this effect
is stronger during night-time than daytime. Flights are more frequently
deviated close to the departure airport and at a relatively large angle to
destination. Moreover, the probability of a deviation is higher in low traffic
phases. All these evidences indicate that deviations are mostly used by
controllers to give directs to flights when traffic conditions allow it.
Finally we introduce a new metric, termed difork, which is able to characterize
navigation points according to the likelihood that a deviation occurs there.
Difork allows to identify in a statistically rigorous way navigation point
pairs where deviations are more (less) frequent than expected under a null
hypothesis of randomness that takes into account the heterogeneity of the
navigation points. Such pairs can therefore be seen as sources of flexibility
(stability) of controllers traffic management while conjugating safety and
efficiency.

advanced into the nature of quantum nonlocality by seeking new links between
quantum and emergent phenomena as described by self-organization, complexity,
or emergence theory? Could the development of a future EmQM lead to a unified,
relational image of the cosmos? One key motivation for adopting the concept of
emergence in relation to quantum theory concerns the persistent failure in
standard physics to unify the two pillars in the foundations of physics:
quantum theory and general relativity theory (GRT). The total contradiction in
the foundational, metaphysical assumptions that define orthodox quantum theory
versus GRT might render inter-theoretic unification impossible. On the one
hand, indeterminism and non-causality define orthodox quantum mechanics, and,
on the other hand, GRT is governed by causality and determinism. How could
these two metaphysically-contradictory theories ever be reconciled? The present
work argues that metaphysical contradiction necessarily implies physical
contradiction. The contradictions are essentially responsible also for the
measurement problem in quantum mechanics. A common foundation may be needed for
overcoming the contradictions between the two foundational theories. The
concept of emergence, and the development of an EmQM, might help advance a
common foundation - physical and metaphysical - as required for successful
inter-theory unification.

obtained via Construction A from non-binary Low-Density Parity-Check codes.
More precisely, a proof is provided that Voronoi constellations of LDA lattices
achieve the capacity of the AWGN channel under lattice encoding and decoding.
This is obtained after showing the same result for more general Construction-A
lattice constellations. The theoretical analysis is carried out in a way that
allows to describe how the prime number underlying Construction A behaves as a
function of the lattice dimension. Moreover, no dithering is required in the
transmission scheme, simplifying some previous solutions of the problem.
Remarkably, capacity is achievable with LDA lattice codes whose parity-check
matrices have constant row and column Hamming weights. Some expansion
properties of random bipartite graphs constitute an extremely important tool
for dealing with sparse matrices and allow to find a lower bound of the minimum
Euclidean distance of LDA lattices in our ensemble.

representations are shown to be valid when the market model satisfies an
appropriate generalization of the no-arbitrage condition and the agent's
utility function satisfies an appropriate generalization of asymptotic
elasticity conditions. When applied to classical liquid market models or models
with bid-ask spreads, we recover well-known pricing formulas in terms of

theory of convex stochastic optimization, we also derive optimality conditions

sufficiently-high linearity to accommodate interfering signals. Typically these
are opposing design goals. For modern radio telescopes operating in the HF
(3-30 MHz) and VHF-low (30-88 MHz) bands, the problem is more nuanced in that
front end noise temperature may be a relatively small component of the system
temperature, and increased linearity may be required due to the particular
interference problems associated with this spectrum. In this paper we present
an analysis of the sensitivity-linearity trade off at these frequencies,
applicable to existing commercially-available monolithic microwave integrated
circuit (MMIC) amplifiers in single-ended, differential, and parallelized
configurations. This analysis and associated findings should be useful in the
design and upgrade of front ends for low frequency radio telescopes. The
analysis is demonstrated explicitly for one of the better-performing amplifiers
encountered in this study, the Mini-Circuits PGA-103, and is confirmed by
hardware measurements. We also present a design based on the Mini-Circuits
HELA-10 amplifier, which is better-suited for applications where linearity is a

equilibration in a Coulomb spin liquid where a short-range energetic coupling
between defects charged under an emergent gauge field supplements their
entropic long-range Coulomb interaction. This work is motivated by the
prevalence of memory effects observed across a wide range of geometrically
frustrated magnetic materials, possibly including the spontaneous Hall effect
observed in Pr2Ir2O7. Our model is canonical spin-ice model on the pyrochlore
lattice, where farther-neighbour spin couplings give rise to a nearest-neighbor
interaction between topological defects which can easily be chosen to be
unnatural or not, i.e. attractive or repulsive between defects of equal gauge
charge. Among the novel features of this model are the following. After
applying a field quench, a rich dynamical approach to equilibrium emerges,
dominated by multi-scale energy barriers responsible for long-lived
magnetization plateaux. These even allow for the metastability of a
""fragmented"" spin liquid, an elusive regime where partial order co-exists with
a spin liquid. Perhaps most strikingly, the attraction produces clusters of
defects whose stability is due to a combination of energetic barriers for their
break-up and proximity of opposite charges along with an entropic barrier
generated by the topological requirement of annihilating a defect only together
with an oppositely charged counterpart. These clusters may take the form of a
""jellyfish"" spin texture, comprising an arrangement of same-sign gauge-charges,
centered on a hexagonal ring with branches of arbitrary length. The ring
carries a clockwise or counterclockwise circular flow of magnetisation. This
emergent toroidal degrees of freedom provides a possibility for time reversal
symmetry breaking with possible relevance to the spontaneous Hall effect
observed in Pr2Ir2O7.

presence of an undiscovered Neptune-size planet at a very large separation from
the Sun. The energy budget of Neptunes on such distant orbits is dominated by
the internal heat released by their cooling rather than solar irradiation
(making them effectively ""isolated""). The blackbody radiation that these
planets emit as they cool may provide the means for their detection. Here we
use an analytical toy model to study the cooling and radiation of isolated
Neptunes. This model can translate a detection (or a null detection) to a
constraint on the size and composition of the hypothesized ""Planet Nine"".
Specifically, the thick gas atmosphere of Neptune-like planets serves as an
insulating blanket which slows down their cooling. Therefore, a measurement of
the blackbody temperature, $T_{\rm eff}\sim 50\textrm{K}$, at which a Neptune
emits can be used to estimate the mass of its atmosphere, $M_{\rm atm}$.
Explicitly, we find the relation $T_{\rm eff}\propto M_{\rm atm}^{1/12}$.
Despite this weak relation, a measurement of the flux at the Wien tail can
constrain the atmospheric mass, at least to within a factor of a few, and
provide useful limits to possible formation scenarios of these planets.
Finally, we constrain the size and composition of Planet Nine by combining our
model with the null results of recent all-sky surveys.

is superconducting, with Tc up to 12.2 K at 10 GPa. This is remarkable, because
elemental oxygen becomes superconducting at much higher pressure (96 GPa) and

elements has the potential of not only decreasing metallization pressure, but
also of increasing Tc. Since {\epsilon}-O8 is called red oxygen, LiO4 can be
identified ""lithium red-oxid"", and is distinct from superoxide. Additionally,
Li5O3 is stable at pressures above 70 GPa and can be represented as a hybrid

has been designed as a test bed for different algorithmic options and data
structures. Among the architectures that this engine can explore, particular
attention is given here to systems equipped with GPUs. The study demonstrates
that our portable PIC implementation based on the OpenACC programming model can
achieve performance closely matching theoretical predictions. Using the Cray
XC30 system, Piz Daint, at the Swiss National Supercomputing Centre (CSCS), we
show that PIC_ENGINE running on an NVIDIA Kepler K20X GPU can outperform the
one on an Intel Sandybridge 8-core CPU by a factor of 3.4.

particles dissolved in a fluid are determined from velocity and force
autocorrelation functions by mesoscale hydrodynamic simulations. Colloids with
both slip and no-slip boundary conditions are considered, which are embedded in
fluids modelled by multiparticle collision dynamics (MPC) with and without
angular momentum conservation. For no-slip boundary conditions, hydrodynamics
yields the well-known Stokes law, while for slip boundary conditions the lack
of angular momentum conservation leads to a reduction of the hydrodynamic
friction coefficient compared to the classical result. The colloid diffusion
coefficient is determined by integration of the velocity autocorrelation
function, where the numerical result at shorter times is combined with the
theoretical hydrodynamic expression for longer times. The suitability of this
approach is confirmed by simulations of sedimenting colloids. In general, we
find only minor deviations from the Stokes-Einstein relation, which even

pulses emitted by young pulsars (ages $\sim$ tens to hundreds of years) born
with regular magnetic field but very short -- few milliseconds -- spin periods.
FRBs are extra-Galactic events coming from distances $d \lesssim 100$ Mpc. Most
of the dispersion measure (DM) comes from the material in the freshly ejected
SNR shell; for a given burst the DM should decrease with time. FRBs are not
expected to be seen below $\sim 300 $ MHz due to free-free absorption in the
expanding ejecta. A supernova might have been detected years before the burst;
FRBs are mostly associated with star forming galaxies.
  The model requires that some pulsars are born with very fast spins, of the
order of few milliseconds. The observed distribution of spin-down powers
$\dot{E}$ in young energetic pulsars is consistent with equal birth rate per
decade of $\dot{E}$. Accepting this injection spectrum and scaling the
intrinsic brightness of FRBs with $\dot{E}$, we predict the following
properties of a large sample of FRBs: (i) the brightest observed events come
from a broad distribution in distances; (ii) for repeating bursts brightness
either remains nearly constant (if the spin-down time is longer than the age of
the pulsar) or decreases with time otherwise; in the latter case DM $\propto
\dot{E}$.

role in solid state astrochemistry. Their surface reactivity is one source of
the observed molecular complexity in space. In experimental astrophysics, the
high reactivity of atoms also constitutes an obstacle to measuring two of the
fundamental properties in surface physics, namely desorption and diffusion
energies, and so far direct measurements are non-existent for O and N atoms. We
investigated the diffusion and desorption processes of O and N atoms on cold
surfaces in order to give boundary conditions to astrochemical models. Here we
propose a new technique for directly measuring the N- and O-atom mass signals.
Including the experimental results in a simple model allows us to almost
directly derive the desorption and diffusion barriers of N atoms on amorphous
solid water ice (ASW) and O atoms on ASW and oxidized graphite. We find a
strong constraint on the values of desorption and thermal diffusion energy
barriers. The measured barriers for O atoms are consistent with recent
independent estimations and prove to be much higher than previously believed
(E$_{des}=1410_{-160}^{+290}$; E$_{dif}=990_{-360}^{+530}$ K on ASW). As for
oxygen atoms, we propose that the combination E$_{des}$-E$_{dif}$=1320-750 K is
a sensible choice among the possible pairs of solutions. Also, we managed to
measure the desorption and diffusion energy of N atoms for the first time
(E$_{des}=720_{-80}^{+160}$; E$_{dif}=525_{-200}^{+260}$ K on ASW) in the
thermal hopping regime and propose that the combination
E$_{des}$-E$_{dif}$=720-400 K can be reasonably adopted in models. The value of
E$_{dif}$ for N atoms is slightly lower than previously suggested, which
implies that the N chemistry on dust grains might be richer.

smaller can be entrained in EUV driven winds. The maximum grain size is set by
dust settling in the disc rather than aerodynamic drag in the wind. More
generally, there is a linear relationship between the base flow density and the
maximum entrainable grain size in the wind. A pileup of micron sized dust
grains can occur in the upper atmosphere at critical radii in the disc as
grains decouple from the low-density wind. Entrainment is a strong function of
location in the disc, resulting in a size sorting of grains in the

Non-observation of $X(\bar b q'q'' \bar q )$ states by LHCb may be just due to
a still lower production rate than the limit of LHCb or at some different mass

"1603.02916","Zachary Roth","Zachary Roth","Analysis of neuronal sequences using pairwise biases",,,,,"q-bio.NC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Sequences of neuronal activation have long been implicated in a variety of
brain functions. In particular, these sequences have been tied to memory
formation and spatial navigation in the hippocampus, a region of mammalian
brains. Traditionally, neuronal sequences have been interpreted as noisy
manifestations of neuronal templates (i.e., orderings), ignoring much richer
structure contained in the sequences. This paper introduces a new tool for
understanding neuronal sequences: the bias matrix. The bias matrix captures the
probabilistic tendency of each neuron to fire before or after each other
neuron. Despite considering only pairs of neurons, the bias matrix captures the
best total ordering of neurons for a sequence (Proposition 3.3) and, thus,
generalizes the concept of a neuronal template.
  We establish basic mathematical properties of bias matrices, in particular
describing the fundamental polytope in which all biases reside (Theorem 3.25).
We show how the underlying simple digraph of a bias matrix, which we term the
bias network, serves as a combinatorial generalization of neuronal templates.
Surprisingly, every simple digraph is realizable as the bias network of some
sequence (Theorem 3.34). The bias-matrix representation leads us to a natural
method for sequence correlation, which then leads to a probabilistic framework
for determining the similarity of one set of sequences to another. Using data
from rat hippocampus, we describe events of interest and also
sequence-detection techniques. Finally, the bias matrix and the similarity
measure are applied to this real-world data using code developed by us.

supercooled liquids. The mean-field approximation of the theory predicts a
dynamical arrest transition, as in ideal Mode-Coupling-Theory and mean-field
discontinuous Spin-Glass Models. Instead {\it beyond} the mean-field
approximation the theory predicts that the transition is avoided and
transformed into a crossover, as observed in experiments and simulations. To go
beyond mean-field a standard perturbative loop expansion is performed at first.
Approaching the ideal critical point this expansion is divergent at all orders
and I show that the leading divergent term at any given order is the same of a
dynamical stochastic equation, called Stochastic-Beta-Relaxation (SBR) in {\it
EPL 106, 56003 (2014)}. At variance with the original theory SBR can be studied
beyond mean-field directly, without the need to resort to a perturbative
expansion. Thus it provides a qualitative and quantitative description of the
dynamical crossover. For consistency reasons it is important to establish the
connection between the dynamical field theory and SBR beyond perturbation
theory. This can be done with the help of a stronger result: the dynamical
field theory is {\it exactly} equivalent to a theory with quenched disorder.
Qualitatively the non-perturbative mechanism leading to the crossover is
therefore the same of SBR. Quantitatively SBR corresponds to make the
mean-field approximation once the quenched disorder has been generated.

potential. Once the position of the guest atom is determined, the fullerene
cavity is modeled by a short range attractive shell according to molecule
symmetry, and the enclosed atom is modeled by an effective one-electron
potential. In order to examine whether the endohedral compound is formed by a
neutral atom inside a neutral fullerene molecule $X@C_{N}$ or if the valence
electron of the encapsulated atom localizes in the fullerene giving rise to a
state with the form $X^{+}@C_{N}^{-}$, we analyze the electronic density, the
projections onto free atomic states, and the weights of partial angular waves.

uniform distribution; the particles with mono-sized distribution have the
highest packing density. It is also found that cohesive effect to the system

accuracy of global tracks in multisensor-multitarget tracking. Most previously
proposed algorithms for bias estimation rely on local measurements in
centralized systems or tracks in distributed systems, along with additional
information like covariances, filter gains or targets of opportunity. In
addition, it is generally assumed that such data are made available to the
fusion center at every sampling time. In practical distributed multisensor
tracking systems, where each platform sends local tracks to the fusion center,
only state estimates and, perhaps, their covariances are sent to the fusion
center at non-consecutive sampling instants or scans. That is, not all the
information required for exact bias estimation at the fusion center is
available in practical distributed tracking systems. In this paper, a new
algorithm that is capable of accurately estimating the biases even in the
absence of filter gain information from local platforms is proposed for
distributed tracking systems with intermittent track transmission. Through the
calculation of the Posterior Cram\'er--Rao lower bound and various simulation
results, it is shown that the performance of the new algorithm, which uses the
tracklet idea and does not require track transmission at every sampling time or
exchange of filter gains, can approach the performance of the exact bias
estimation algorithm that requires local filter gains.

in target tracking. As in the case of radar tracking, the presence of offset or

Modeling various sensor biases is not a trivial task and not much has been done
in the literature specifically for bearing--only tracking. This paper addresses
the modeling of offset biases in bearing--only sensors and the ensuing
multitarget tracking with bias compensation. Bias estimation is handled at the
fusion node to which individual sensors report their local tracks in the form
of associated measurement reports (AMR) or angle-only tracks. The modeling is
based on a multisensor approach that can effectively handle a time--varying
number of targets in the surveillance region. The proposed algorithm leads to a
maximum likelihood bias estimator. The corresponding Cram\'er--Rao Lower Bound
to quantify the theoretical accuracy that can be achieved by the proposed
method or any other algorithm is also derived. Finally, simulation results on
different distributed tracking scenarios are presented to demonstrate the
capabilities of the proposed approach. In order to show that the proposed
method can work even with false alarms and missed detections, simulation
results on a centralized tracking scenario where the local sensors send all
their measurements (not AMRs or local tracks) are also presented.

Laser diffraction (or small angle light scattering) is commonly used, usually

this method requires the solution of an inverse problem using a suitable
scattering model that takes into account size, shape and optical properties of
the particles. However, laser diffraction instruments are usually accompanied
by software that employs a default scattering model for spherical particles,
which is then used to solve the inverse problem even though a significant
number of particulate products occur in strongly non-spherical shapes such as
needles. In this work, we demonstrate that using the spherical model for the
estimation of sizes of needle-like particles can lead to the appearance of
artefacts in the form of multimodal populations of particles with size modes
much smaller than those actually present in the sample. This effect can result
in a significant under-estimation of the mean particle size and in false modes

However, the light trance on better living space is stimulated by socioeconomic

emerges for the autonomous provisioning of pervasive things or objects from
relevant perturbation for advanced scientific instrumentation. Meanwhile,
citizens are observed in being transfixed by lively stimuli of monotonous urban
events with the advent of virtual reality or augmented things. Thus, due to the
involvement of situation-awareness or contextualization,
engagement/participation information as a utility promises to improve urban
experience. However, it is complex to grapple meaningful concepts due to
personalization obstacles, such as citizen psychology, information gap,
service-visualization. Moreover, recommended practices deficit adaptation to
monochromatic choice, disparate impairments, mobility and annotation-richness
in urban space. Hence, rejuvenation of engagement relates to monitoring and

domains consist of manifold layers to form multiplex networks. The multiple
network layers give rise to nonlinear effect for the emergent dynamics of
systems. Especially, weak layers that can potentially play significant role in
amplifying the vulnerability of multiplex networks might be shadowed in the
aggregated single-layer network framework which indiscriminately accumulates
all layers. Here we present a simple model of cascading failure on multiplex
networks of weight-heterogeneous layers. By simulating the model on the
multiplex network of international trades, we found that the multiplex model
produces more catastrophic cascading failures which are the result of emergent
collective effect of coupling layers, rather than the simple sum thereof.
Therefore risks can be systematically underestimated in single-layer network
analyses because the impact of weak layers can be overlooked. We anticipate
that our simple theoretical study can contribute to further investigation and
design of optimal risk-averse real-world complex systems.

confinement of matter within the bounding planes is considered. We find that,
in thermal equilibrium, the nondissipative axial current along the magnetic
field is induced, depending on chemical potential and temperature, as well as
on a choice of boundary conditions. As temperature increases from zero to large
values, a stepwise behaviour of the axial current density as a function of
chemical potential is changed to a smooth one; the choice of a boundary
condition can facilitate either amplification or diminution of the chiral
separation effect. This points at a significant role of boundaries for physical
systems with hot dense magnetized relativistic spinor matter, e.g., compact
stars, heavy-ion collisions, novel materials known as Dirac and Weyl
semimetals.

quantum-chromodynamic (QCD) matter is studied in the hadron resonance gas and
the Polyakov linear-sigma models and compared with recent lattice calculations.
Both models are fairly suited to describe the degrees of freedom in the
hadronic phase. The partonic ones are only accessible by the second model. It
is found that the QCD matter has paramagnetic properties, which monotonically
depend on the temperature and are not affected by the hadron-quark
phase-transition. Furthermore, raising the magnetic field strength increases
the thermodynamic quantities, especially in the hadronic phase but reduces the
critical temperature, i.e. inverse magnetic catalysis.
