  Disturbances: A Regularization Approach",,,,,"math.OC","http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/","  An optimal control problem with an infinite horizon quadratic cost functional
for a linear system with a known additive disturbance is considered. The
feature of this problem is that a weight matrix of the control cost in the cost
functional is singular. Due to this singularity, the problem can be solved
neither by application of the Pontriagin's Maximum Principle, nor using the
Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation approach, i.e. this problem is singular. Since
the weight matrix of the control cost, being singular, is not in general zero,
only a part of the control coordinates is singular, while the others are
regular. This problem is solved by a regularization method. Namely, it is
associated with a new optimal control problem for the same equation of
dynamics. The cost functional in this new problem is the sum of the original
cost functional and an infinite horizon integral of the squares of the singular
control coordinates with a small positive weight. Due to a smallness of this
coefficient, the new problem is a partial cheap control problem. Using a
perturbation technique, an asymptotic analysis of this partial cheap control
problem is carried out. Based on this analysis, the infimum of the cost
functional in the original problem is derived, and a minimizing sequence of
state-feedback controls is designed. An illustrative example of a singular
trajectory tracking is presented.

a limit for such cavitation to occur spontaneously, thereby defining a

independent diffusing particles in a closed domain, containing a sub-region

manipulate Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya Interaction (DMI) in ultrathin magnetic films.
First, we find that DMI is significantly enhanced when the ferromagnetic (FM)
layer is sandwiched between nonmagnetic (NM) layers inducing additive DMI in
NM/FM/NM structures. For instance, as Pt and Ir below Co induce DMI of opposite
chirality, inserting Co between Pt (below) and Ir (above) in Ir/Co/Pt trilayers
enhances the DMI of Co/Pt bilayers by 15\%. Furthermore, in case of Pb/Co/Pt
trilayers (Ir/Fe/Co/Pt multilayers), DMI can be enhanced by 50\% (almost
doubled) compared to Co/Pt bilayers reaching a very large DMI amplitude of 2.7
(3.2) meV/atom. Our second approach for enhancing DMI is to use oxide capping
layer. We show that DMI is enhanced by 60\% in Oxide/Co/Pt structures compared
to Co/Pt bilayers. Moreover, we unveiled the DMI mechanism at Oxide/Co inerface
due to interfacial electric field effect, which is different to Fert-Levy DMI
at FM/NM interfaces. Finally, we demonstrate that DMI amplitude can be
modulated using an electric field with efficiency factor comparable to that of
the electric field control of perpendicular magnetic anisotropy in transition
metal/oxide interfaces. These approaches of DMI controlling pave the way for
skyrmions and domain wall motion-based spintronic applications.

analytic challenges relative to evaluating the palliative care treatment
efficacy which is to improve patients diminishing QOL as disease progresses
towards end of life (EOL). A unique feature of palliative care clinical trials
is that patients will experience decreasing QOL during the trial despite

highly correlated which, in the face of censoring, makes it challenging to

equations whose zeros are uniquely related to Hadamard matrices with one or two
circulant cores of a given order. Based on this idea, the cocyclic Hadamard
test enable us to describe a polynomial ideal that characterizes the set of
cocyclic Hadamard matrices over a fixed finite group $G$ of order $4t$.
Nevertheless, the complexity of the computation of the reduced Gr\""obner basis
of this ideal is $2^{O(t^2)}$, which is excessive even for very small orders.
In order to improve the efficiency of this polynomial method, we take advantage
of some recent results on the inner structure of a cocyclic matrix to describe
an alternative polynomial ideal that also characterizes the mentioned set of
cocyclic Hadamard matrices over $G$. The complexity of the computation
decreases in this way to $2^{O(n)}$, where $n$ is the number of
$G$-coboundaries. Particularly, we design two specific procedures for looking
for $\mathbb{Z}_t \times \mathbb{Z}_2^2$-cocyclic Hadamard matrices and
$D_{4t}$-cocyclic Hadamard matrices, so that larger cocyclic Hadamard matrices
(up to $t \leq 31$) are explicitly obtained.

The characteristic radio emissions are made possible in part by plasma from the

that neighboring exomoons and the exoplanetary magnetosphere could also provide
enough plasma to generate a detectable signal. In particular, the

portfolios that are relative arbitrages with respect to the market portfolio

slightly relaxed question affirmative in the following high dimensional sense,
where dimension refers to the number of stocks being traded. Very roughly,
suppose that for every dimension we have a continuous semimartingale market
such that (i) the vector of market weights in decreasing order has a stationary
regularly varying tail with an index between $-1$ and $-1/2$ and (ii) zero is
not a limit point of the relative volatilities of the stocks. Then, given a
probability $\eta < 1$ arbitrarily close to one, two arbitrarily small
$\epsilon, \delta >0$, and an arbitrarily high positive amount $M$, for all
high enough dimensions, it is possible to construct a functionally generated
portfolio such that, with probability at least $\eta$, its relative value with
respect to the market at time $\delta$ is at least $M$, and never goes below
$(1-\epsilon)$ during $[0, \delta]$. There are two phase transitions; if the
index of the tail is less than $-1$ or larger than $-1/2$. The construction
uses properties of regular variation, high-dimensional convex geometry and
concentration of measure under Dirichlet distributions. We crucially use the
notion of $(K,N)$ convex functions introduced by Erbar, Kuwada, Sturm in the
context of curvature-dimension conditions and Bochner's inequalities.

optimization formulation of limit analysis is written by the form of
second-order cone programming (SOCP) in order to exploit the high efficiency of

one of $K$ ads to the user. The system uses an internal ad recommendation
policy to map the user's profile (context) to one of the ads. The user either
clicks or ignores the ad and correspondingly, the system updates its
recommendation policy. PAR problem is usually tackled by scalable
\emph{contextual bandit} algorithms, where the policies are generally based on
classifiers. A practical problem in PAR is extreme click sparsity, due to very
few users actually clicking on ads. We systematically study the drawback of
using contextual bandit algorithms based on classifier-based policies, in face
of extreme click sparsity. We then suggest an alternate policy, based on
rankers, learnt by optimizing the Area Under the Curve (AUC) ranking loss,
which can significantly alleviate the problem of click sparsity. We conduct
extensive experiments on public datasets, as well as three industry proprietary
datasets, to illustrate the improvement in click-through-rate (CTR) obtained by
using the ranker-based policy over classifier-based policies.

enough that performance predictions can be made based on simple computing
hardware models. The surrounding kernels provide the context for each kernel
that allows rigorous definition of both the input and the output for each
kernel. Furthermore, since the proposed PageRank pipeline benchmark is scalable
in both problem size and hardware, it can be used to measure and quantitatively
compare a wide range of present day and future systems. Serial implementations
in C++, Python, Python with Pandas, Matlab, Octave, and Julia have been
implemented and their single threaded performance has been measured.

affected by final state interactions, energy loss or absorption. A detailed
phenomenological study of this process is thus convenient for investigation of
the onset of initial-state effects in proton-nucleus ($pA$) collisions. In this
paper, we present a comprehensive analysis of the DY process in $pA$
interactions at RHIC and LHC energies in the color dipole framework. We analyse
several effects affecting the nuclear suppression, $R_{pA}<1$, of dilepton
pairs, such as the saturation effects, restrictions imposed by energy
conservation (the initial-state effective energy loss) and the gluon shadowing,
as a function of the rapidity, invariant mass of dileptons and their transverse
momenta $p_T$. In this analysis, we take into account besides the $\gamma^*$
also the $Z^0$ contribution to the production cross section, thus extending the
predictions to large dilepton invariant masses. Besides the nuclear attenuation
of produced dileptons at large energies and forward rapidities emerging due to
the onset of shadowing effects, we predict a strong suppression at large $p_T$,
dilepton invariant masses and Feynman $x_F$ caused by the Initial State
Interaction effects in kinematic regions where no shadowing is expected. The
manifestations of nuclear effects are investigated also in terms of the
correlation function in azimuthal angle between the dilepton pair and a forward
pion $\Delta\phi$ for different energies, dilepton rapidites and invariant
dilepton masses. We predict that the characteristic double-peak structure of
the correlation function around $\Delta \phi\simeq \pi$ arises for very forward
pions and large-mass dilepton pairs.

configurations of a finite system of particles interacting between them due to
attracting or repulsive forces given by a certain inter molecular potential. We
limit ourselves to the cases of three particles arranged in a triangular array
and that of four particles in a tetrahedral array. The minimization is
constrained to fixed area in the case of the triangular array, and to fixed
volume in the tetrahedral case. For a general class of inter molecular
potentials we give conditions for the homogeneous configuration (either an
equilateral triangle or a regular tetrahedron) of the array to be stable, that
is, a minimizer of the potential energy of the system. To determine whether or
not there exist other stable states, the system of first order necessary
conditions for a minimum is treated as a bifurcation problem with the area or
volume variable as the bifurcation parameter. Because of the symmetries present
in our problem, we can apply the techniques of equivariant bifurcation theory
to show that there exist branches of non--homogeneous solutions bifurcating
from the trivial branch of homogeneous solutions at precisely the values of the
parameter of area or volume for which the homogeneous configuration changes
stability. For the triangular array, we construct numerically the bifurcation
diagrams for both a Lennard--Jones and Buckingham potentials. The numerics show
that there exist non--homogeneous stable states, multiple stable states for
intervals of values of the area parameter, and secondary bifurcations as well.

determine analytically the optimal load and stiffness of a harmonically driven

do not find any benefit of load and stiffness adjustment beyond maintaining a
saturated power level. For strong coupling we find that the power can be

second critical force, determined by a resonator figure-of-merit, at which the

describing the light distribution of stellar spheroidal and disk components,
with the S\'ersic index $n$ providing a direct measure of the central radial
concentration of stars. The S\'ersic index of a galaxy's spheroidal component,
$n_{sph}$, has been shown to tightly correlate with the mass of the central
supermassive black hole, $M_{BH}$. The $M_{BH}-n_{sph}$ correlation is also
expected from other two well known scaling relations involving the spheroid
luminosity, $L_{sph}$: the $L_{sph}-n_{sph}$ and the $M_{BH}-L_{sph}$.
Obtaining an accurate estimate of the spheroid S\'ersic index requires a
careful modelling of a galaxy's light distribution and some studies have failed
to recover a statistically significant $M_{BH}-n_{sph}$ correlation. With the
aim of re-investigating the $M_{BH}-n_{sph}$ and other black hole mass scaling
relations, we performed a detailed (i.e.~bulge, disks, bars, spiral arms,
rings, halo, nucleus, etc.) decomposition of 66 galaxies, with directly
measured black hole masses, that had been imaged at $3.6\rm~\mu m$ with
Spitzer. In this paper, the third of this series, we present an analysis of the
$L_{sph}-n_{sph}$ and $M_{BH}-n_{sph}$ diagrams. While early-type
(elliptical+lenticular) and late-type (spiral) galaxies split into two separate
relations in the $L_{sph}-n_{sph}$ and $M_{BH}-L_{sph}$ diagrams, they reunite
into a single $M_{BH} \propto n_{sph}^{3.39 \pm 0.15}$ sequence with relatively
small intrinsic scatter ($\epsilon \simeq 0.25 \rm~dex$). The black hole mass
appears to be closely related to the spheroid central concentration of stars,
which mirrors the inner gradient of the spheroid gravitational potential.

a mixed curl-curl formulation of the Maxwell's problem. We use polynomials of

condenses out of the hot confining medium due to the increase in line opacity
as the cloud cools. However, acceleration by radiation pressure is not very
efficient when the flux is time-independent, unless the flow is
one-dimensional. Here we explore how acceleration is affected by a time-varying
flux, as AGN are known to be highly variable. If the period of flux
oscillations is longer than the thermal timescale, we expect the gas to cool
during the low flux state, and therefore line opacity should quickly increase.
The cloud will receive a small kick due to the increased radiation force. We
perform hydrodynamical simulations using Athena to confirm this effect and
quantify its importance. We find that despite the flow becoming turbulent in 2D
due to hydrodynamic instabilities, a 20% modulation of the flux leads to a net
increase in acceleration --- by more than a factor of 2 --- in both 1D and 2D.
We show that this is sufficient to produce the observed line widths, although
we only consider optically thin clouds. We discuss the implications of our
results for photoionization modeling and reverberation mapping.

asymmetric binary neutron stars in numerical relativity. Neutron stars are
modeled by soft and moderately stiff finite-temperature equations of state
(EOS). We find that the properties of the dynamical ejecta such as the total
mass, neutron richness profile, and specific entropy profile depend on the mass
ratio of the binary systems for a given EOS in a unique manner. For the soft
EOS (SFHo), the total ejecta mass depends weakly on the mass ratio, but the
average of electron number per baryon ($Y_e$) and specific entropy ($s$) of the
ejecta decreases significantly with the increase of the degree of mass
asymmetry. For the stiff EOS (DD2), with the increase of the mass asymmetry
degree, the total ejecta mass significantly increases while the average of
$Y_e$ and $s$ moderately decreases. We find again that only for the soft EOS
(SFHo), the total ejecta mass exceeds $0.01M_\odot$ irrespective of the mass
ratio chosen in this paper. The ejecta have a variety of electron number per
baryon with its average approximately between $Y_e \sim 0.2$ and $\sim 0.3$

the r-process heavy elements (second and third peaks), although its averaged
value decreases with the increase of the degree of mass asymmetry.

decreases with respect to the electron pitch-angle cosine $\mu_0$ at which the
electron distribution peaks, while the growth rates for other modes (X1, O1,
O2) initially increase before decreasing as $\mu_0$ increases. Moreover, the O
mode as well as the X mode can be the fastest growth mode, in terms of not only
the plasma parameter but also the type of electron pitch-angle distribution.
This result presents a significant extension of the recent researches on ECME
driven by the lower-energy cutoff of power-law electrons, in which the X mode

which can increase the amount of information carried by each channel
measurement and thus reduce the required channel estimation time compared to
the existing non-overlapped designs. We develop a maximum likelihood (ML)
estimator to optimally extract the path information from the channel
measurements. Then, we propose a novel rate-adaptive channel estimation (RACE)
algorithm, which can dynamically adjust the number of channel measurements
based on the expected probability of estimation error (PEE). The performance of
both proposed algorithms is analyzed. For the FCE algorithm, an approximate
closed-form expression for the PEE is derived. For the RACE algorithm, a lower
bound for the minimum signal energy-to-noise ratio required for a given number
of channel measurements is developed based on the Shannon-Hartley theorem.
Simulation results show that the FCE algorithm significantly reduces the number
of channel estimation measurements compared to the existing algorithms using
non-overlapped beam patterns. By adopting the RACE algorithm, we can achieve up
to a 6dB gain in signal energy-to-noise ratio for the same PEE compared to the

influence on the electron Fermi energy, $E_{\rm F}(e)$, in the circumstance of
magnetars, which are powered by magnetic field energy. In a magnetar, the
Landau levels of degenerate and relativistic electrons are strongly quantized.
A new quantity $g_{n}$, the electron Landau-level stability coefficient is
introduced. According to the requirement that $g_{n}$ decreases with increasing
the magnetic field intensity $B$, the magnetic-field index $\beta$ in the
expression of $E_{\rm F}(e)$ must be positive. By introducing the
Dirac$-\delta$ function, we deduce a general formulae for the Fermi energy of
degenerate and relativistic electrons, and obtain a particular solution to
$E_{\rm F}(e)$ in a superhigh magnetic field (SMF). This solution has a low
magnetic-field index of $\beta=1/6$, compared with the previous one, and works
when $\rho\geq 10^{7}$~g cm$^{-3}$ and $B_{\rm cr}\ll B\leq 10^{17}$~Gauss. By
modifying the phase space of relativistic electrons, a SMF can enhance the
electron number density $n_e$, and decrease the maximum of electron Landau
level number, which results in a redistribution of electrons. According to
Pauli exclusion principle, the degenerate electrons will fill quantum states
from the lowest Landau level to the highest Landau level. As $B$ increases,
more and more electrons will occupy higher Landau levels, though $g_{n}$
decreases with the Landau level number $n$. The enhanced $n_{e}$ in a SMF means
an increase in the electron Fermi energy and an increase in the electron
degeneracy pressure. The results are expected to facilitate the study of the
weak-interaction processes inside neutron stars and the magnetic-thermal
evolution mechanism for megnetars.

studies of galaxies and cosmology. Recent studies provided a global picture of
cosmic star formation history. However, what drives the evolution of star
formation activities in galaxies has long been a matter of debate. The key
factor of the star formation is the transition of hydrogen from atomic to
molecular state, since the star formation is associated with the molecular
phase. This transition is also strongly coupled with chemical evolution,
because dust grains, i.e., tiny solid particles of heavy elements, play a
critical role in molecular formation. Therefore, a comprehensive understanding
of neutral-molecular gas transition, star formation and chemical enrichment is
necessary to clarify the galaxy formation and evolution. Here we present the
activity of SKA-JP galaxy evolution sub-science working group (subSWG) Our
activity is focused on three epochs: z \sim 0, 1, and z > 3. At z \sim 0, we
try to construct a unified picture of atomic and molecular hydrogen through
nearby galaxies in terms of metallicity and other various ISM properties. Up to
intermediate redshifts z \sim 1, we explore scaling relations including gas and
star formation properties, like the main sequence and the Kennicutt-Schmidt law
of star forming galaxies. To connect the global studies with spatially-resolved
investigations, such relations will be plausibly a viable way. For high
redshift objects, the absorption lines of HI 21-cm line will be a very
promising observable to explore the properties of gas in galaxies. By these
studies, we will surely witness a real revolution in the studies of galaxies by
SKA.

movement of organisms and processes between areas of intact habitat, and thus
provide landscape corridor. Corridors are thus regions within a given landscape
that generally comprise native vegetation, and connect otherwise fragmented,
disconnected, non-contiguous wildlife habitat patches in the landscape. The
purpose of designing corridors as a conservation strategy is primarily to
counter, and to the extent possible, mitigate the impacts of habitat
fragmentation and loss on the biodiversity of the landscape, as well as support
continuance of land use for essential local and global economic activities in
the region of reference. In this paper, we use game theory and graph theory to
model and design a wildlife corridor network in the Central India Eastern Ghats
landscape complex, with tiger (Panthera tigris tigris) as the focal species. We
construct a graph using the habitat patches supporting wild tiger populations
in the landscape complex as vertices and the possible paths between these
vertices as edges. A cost matrix is constructed to indicate the cost incurred
by the tiger for passage between the habitat patches in the landscape, by
modelling a two-person Prisoners Dilemma game. A minimum spanning tree is then
obtained by employing Kruskals algorithm, which would suggest a feasible tiger
corridor network for the tiger population within the landscape complex.
Additionally, analysis of the graph is done using various centrality measures,
in order to identify and focus on potentially important habitat patches, and
their potential community structure. Correlation analysis is performed on the
centrality indices to draw out interesting trends in the network.

the contact nature of the pure supercell with Au and Pd. We find that while Au
is physiosorped and forms n-type contact, Pd is chemisorped and forms p-type
contact with a higher valence electron density. Next, we study the interface
formed between the Cl-doped supercell and metals and observe a reduction in the
Schottky barrier height (SBH) in comparison to the pure supercell. This
reduction found is higher for Pd in comparison to Au which is further validated
by examining the charge transfer occurring at the interface. Our study confirms
that Cl doping is an efficient mechanism to reduce the n-SBH for both Au and Pd

white Gaussian noise (AWGN) channels in bandwidth expansion regime, i.e., the

propagation phenomenon of conventional digital transmission schemes, we propose
in this paper a new capacity-approaching joint source channel coding (JSCC)
scheme based on partially block Markov superposition transmission (BMST) of
nested lattice codes. In the proposed scheme, first, the Gaussian source
sequence is discretized by a lattice-based quantizer, resulting in a sequence
of lattice points. Second, these lattice points are encoded by a short
systematic group code. Third, the coded sequence is partitioned into blocks of
equal length and then transmitted in the BMST manner. Main characteristics of
the proposed JSCC scheme include: 1) Entropy coding is not used explicitly. 2)
Only parity-check sequence is superimposed, hence, termed partially BMST
(PBMST). This is different from the original BMST. To show the superior
performance of the proposed scheme, we present extensive simulation results
which show that the proposed scheme performs within 1.0 dB of the Shannon
limits. Hence, the proposed scheme provides an attractive candidate for
transmission of Gaussian sources.

assess the impact of a larger, more realistic initial orbital separation on the

separation is somewhat larger and the amount of unbound mass slightly greater
when the initial separation is wide enough that the giant does not yet overflow

envelope problem here for the first time and a full comparison with ENZO is
presented, including an investigation of convergence as well as energy and
angular momentum conservation. We also set our simulations in the context of
past simulations. This comparison reveals that it is the expansion of the giant

final separation. We also suggest that the large range in unbound mass for
different simulations is difficult to explain and may have something to do with
simulations that are not fully converged.

phosphorene, arsenene, antimonene and even nitrogene. Motivated by them, based
upon first-principles density functional calculations, we propose a new
two-dimensional phosphorus nitride (PN) structure that is stable well above the
room temperature, due to its extremely high cohesive energy. Unlike
phosphorene, PN structure is resistant to high temperature oxidation. The
structure is predicted to be a semiconductor with a wide, indirect band gap of
2.64 eV. More interestingly, the phosphorus nitride monolayer experiences an
indirect-to-direct band-gap transition at a relatively small tensile strain.
Such dramatic transformation in the electronic structure combined with
structural stability and oxidation resistance at high temperature could pave
the way for exciting innovations in high-speed ultrathin transistors, power
electronic modules, ultra-high efficiency LEDs and semiconductor lasers.

magnetic clusters start developing well above the peak temperature T^* in the
ac susceptibility. The volume fraction of the magnetically ordered region
increases continuously with decreasing temperature, showing no anomaly at T^*,
and reaches nearly 100% at the lowest temperature. The temperature variation of
the volume fraction is essentially independent of the La concentration in the x
range presently investigated, although the dc magnetization is significantly
suppressed with increasing x. Neutron powder diffraction experiments revealed
that the ground state for x = 0.3 is a long-range ferromagnetic ordered state.
These results indicate that, with decreasing temperature, cluster-glass states
in Sr1-xLaxRuO3 gradually develop into long-range ferromagnetic ordered states
with decreasing temperature, and that the magnetic ordering process differs
strikingly from that expected for a conventional second-order ferromagnetic
transition.

field coupled to the dilaton gravity, moving leftwards, collapses to form a
black hole. There are two sets of asymptotic ($t\to\infty$) observers, around
$x\to\infty$ and $x\to-\infty$. The observers at the right null infinity
witness a thermal flux of radiation associated with time dependent geometry
leading to a black hole formation and its subsequent Hawking evaporation, in an
expected manner. We show that even the observers at left null infinity find
themselves in thermal ambiance, without experiencing any change of spacetime
geometry all along their trajectories. They remain as inertial observers in a
\emph{flat} region of spacetime where curvature tensor identically vanishes in
a portion of full spacetime. These observers find the state of the quantum
field in a late time thermal configuration, with \emph{exactly the same}
temperature as measured by the observers at right null infinity, {\it despite
being inertial in flat spacetime region throughout their history}. This is very
closely related to the standard Unruh effect in the flat spacetime, except for
a key difference --- since they are inertial throughout and {\it have no
causally connected source in the past light cone to account for what they see}.
The result arises from quantum correlations which extend outside the past light
cone and is conceptually similar to the EPR correlations.

magnitude above the expected bulk solar system silicates value. From the
presence of several different Hg carrier phases in thermal release profiles
(150 to 650 {\deg}C), we argue that these variations are unlikely to be mainly
due to terrestrial contamination. The Hg abundance of meteorites shows no
correlation with petrographic type, or mass-dependent fractionation of Hg
isotopes. Most carbonaceous chondrites show mass-independent enrichments in the
odd-numbered isotopes 199Hg and 201Hg. We show that the enrichments are not
nucleosynthetic, as we do not find corresponding nucleosynthetic deficits of
196Hg. Instead, they can partially be explained by Hg evaporation and
redeposition during heating of asteroids from primordial radionuclides and
late-stage impact heating. Non-carbonaceous chondrites, most achondrites and
the Earth do not show these enrichments in vapor-phase Hg. All meteorites
studied here have however isotopically light Hg ({\delta}202Hg = ~-7 to -1)
relative to the Earth's average crustal values, which could suggest that the
Earth has lost a significant fraction of its primordial Hg. However, the late
accretion of carbonaceous chondritic material on the order of ~2%, which has
been suggested to account for the water, carbon, nitrogen and noble gas
inventories of the Earth, can also contribute most or all of the Earth's
current Hg budget. In this case, the isotopically heavy Hg of the Earth's crust
would have to be the result of isotopic fractionation between surface and
deep-Earth reservoirs.

powerful features extracted using deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs).
However, existing CNN-based methods operate at the patch level instead of the

boundary of salient objects. Furthermore, image patches are treated as
independent samples even when they are overlapping, giving rise to significant
redundancy in computation and storage. In this CVPR 2016 paper, we propose an
end-to-end deep contrast network to overcome the aforementioned limitations.
Our deep network consists of two complementary components, a pixel-level fully
convolutional stream and a segment-wise spatial pooling stream. The first
stream directly produces a saliency map with pixel-level accuracy from an input
image. The second stream extracts segment-wise features very efficiently, and
better models saliency discontinuities along object boundaries. Finally, a
fully connected CRF model can be optionally incorporated to improve spatial

hereditary graph class has a labeling scheme with a polynomial-time computable
label decoder. We approach this conjecture by investigating classes of label
decoders defined in terms of complexity classes such as P and EXP. For
instance, GP denotes the class of graph classes that have a labeling scheme
with a polynomial-time computable label decoder. Until now it was not even
known whether GP is a strict subset of GR. We show that this is indeed the case
and reveal a strict hierarchy akin to classical complexity. We also show that
classes such as GP can be characterized in terms of graph parameters. This
could mean that certain algorithmic problems are feasible on every graph class
in GP. Lastly, we define a more restrictive class of label decoders using
first-order logic that already contains many natural graph classes such as
forests and interval graphs. We give an alternative characterization of this
class in terms of directed acyclic graphs. By showing that some small,
hereditary graph class cannot be expressed with such label decoders a weaker
form of the implicit graph conjecture could be disproven.

authoritative leaders. A real-world example would be a corrupt society where
people revolt against such leaders, but it can be applied to more general
situations. In our model, agents can change their opinion depending on their
authority relative to their neighbors and their own confidence level. In
addition, with a certain probability, agents can override the affirmative
opinion to take the dissenting opinion of a neighbor. Based on analytic
derivation and numerical simulations, we observe that both the network
structure and heterogeneity in authority, and their correlation, significantly
affect the possibility of the dissenting opinion to spread through the
population. In particular, the dissenting opinion is suppressed when the
authority distribution is very heterogeneous and there exists a positive
correlation between the authority and the number of neighbors of people
(degree). Except for such an extreme case, though, spreading of the dissenting
opinion takes place when people have the tendency to override the authority to
hold the dissenting opinion, but the dissenting opinion can take a long time to
spread to the entire society, depending on the model parameters. We argue that
the internal social structure of agents sets the scale of the time to reach

the usage of a specific vocabulary (Domain Informativeness); then, the adoption

is not fully satisfactory. The explicit inclusion of dispersion interactions
generally improves the description, but there remain large disagreements
between the predictions of different dispersion-inclusive methods. We present
here a review of DFT work on water clusters, ice structures and liquid water,

review highlights the crucial role of dispersion in describing the delicate
balance between compact and extended structures of many different water

extremely important, so that the choice of semi-local or hybrid functional
employed in dispersion-inclusive methods is crucial. The origins and
consequences of beyond-2-body errors of approximate XC functionals are noted,
and we also discuss the substantial differences between different

tool in the fight against infectious disease. However, their interpretation
rests on a number of simplifying assumptions that regularly ignore important
complexities of real data, in particular within-host evolution and non-sampled
patients.
  Here we propose a new approach to transmission inference called SCOTTI
(Structured COalescent Transmission Tree Inference). This method is based on a
statistical framework that models each host as a distinct population, and
transmissions between hosts as migration events. Our computationally efficient
implementation of this model enables the inference of host-to-host transmission
while accommodating within-host evolution and non-sampled hosts. SCOTTI is
distributed as an open source package for the phylogenetic software BEAST2.
  We show that SCOTTI can generally infer transmission events even in the
presence of considerable within-host variation, can account for the uncertainty
associated with the possible presence of non-sampled hosts, and can efficiently
use data from multiple samples of the same host, although there is some
reduction in accuracy when samples are collected very close to the infection
time.
  We illustrate the features of our approach by investigating transmission from
genetic and epidemiological data in a Foot and Mouth Disease Virus (FMDV)
veterinary outbreak in England and a Klebsiella pneumoniae outbreak in a Nepali
neonatal unit. Transmission histories inferred with SCOTTI will be important in
devising effective measures to prevent and halt transmission.

the magnetization and particle-density dynamics in a single hydrodynamic

respective chemical potential gradients. As an application, we propose an
experimentally accessible stationary state, where the two types of
supercurrents counterflow and cancel each other, thus resulting in no mass
transport. Furthermore, we propose a straightforward setup to probe spin
superfluidity by measuring the in-plane magnetization angle of the whole cloud
of atoms. We verify the robustness of these findings by evaluating the
four-magnon collision time, and find that the time scale for coherent
(superfluid) dynamics is separated from that of the slower incoherent dynamics
by one order of magnitude. Comparing the atom and magnon kinetics reveals that
while the former can be hydrodynamic, the latter is typically collisionless
under most experimental conditions. This implies that, while our
zero-temperature hydrodynamic equations are a valid description of spin

investigated by the momentum-space entanglement after a quantum quench using
analytical and numerical methods. We show that the momentum-space entanglement
spectrum of a LL possesses many universal features both in equilibrium and
after a quantum quench. The largest entanglement eigenvalue is identical to the
Loschmidt echo, i.e. the overlap of the disentangled and final wavefunctions of
the system. The second largest eigenvalue is the overlap of the first excited
state of the disentangled system with zero total momentum and the final
wavefunction. The entanglement gap is universal both in equilibrium and after a
quantum quench. The momentum-space entanglement entropy is always extensive and
saturates fast to a time independent value after the quench, in sharp contrast
to a spatial bipartitioning.

users in a set of a large number of potentially active users. The users from
the subset are activated randomly, such that the access point (AP) does not
know the subset or its size a priori. The active users are contending to report
their activity to the AP over a multiple access channel. We devise a contention
algorithm that assumes a combination of physical-layer network coding and
K-out-of-N signature coding, allowing for multiple detection of up to K users
at the access point. In addition, we rely on the principles of coded slotted
ALOHA (CSA) and use of successive interference cancellation to enable
subsequent resolution of the collisions that originally featured more than K
users. The objective is to identify the subset of active users such that the
target performance, e.g., probability of active user resolution and/or
throughput is reached, which implies that the duration of the contention period
is also not known a priori. In contrast to standard CSA approaches, in the
proposed algorithm each user, active or not, has a predefined schedule of slots
in which it sends its signature. We analyze the performance of the proposed
algorithm both in the asymptotic and non-asymptotic settings. We also derive an
estimator that, based on the observation of collision multiplicities, estimates
how many users are active and thereby enables tuning of the length of the

channel current of ion channels even when it is too small to be resolved
directly with the patch clamp technique. This is the case for voltage-gated
Ca2+ channels (VGCCs). They are present in all mammalian central neurons,
controlling presynaptic release of transmitter, postsynaptic signaling and
synaptic integration. The amplitudes of their single channel currents in a
physiological concentration of extracellular Ca2+, however, are small and not
well determined. But measurement of this quantity is essential for estimating
numbers of functional VGCCs in the membrane and the size of channel-associated
Ca2+ signaling domains, and for understanding the stochastic nature of Ca2+
signaling. Here, we recorded the VGCC current in nucleated patches from layer 5
pyramidal neurons in rat neocortex, in physiological external Ca2+ (1-2 mM).
The ensemble-averaging of current responses required for conventional
fluctuation analysis proved impractical because of the rapid rundown of VGCC
currents. We therefore developed a more robust method, using mean current
fitting of individual current responses and band-pass filtering. Furthermore,
voltage ramp stimulation proved useful. We validated the accuracy of the method
by analyzing simulated data. At an external Ca2+ concentration of 1 mM, and a
membrane potential of -20 mV, we found that the average single channel current
amplitude was about 0.04 pA, increasing to 0.065 pA at 2 mM external Ca2+, and
0.12 pA at 5 mM. The relaxation time constant of the fluctuations was in the
range 0.2-0.8 ms. The results are relevant to understanding the stochastic
properties of dendritic Ca2+ spikes in neocortical layer 5 pyramidal neurons.
With the reported method, single channel current amplitude of native VGCCs can
be resolved accurately despite conditions of unstable rundown.

describe slow and dilated granular fluids, where prolonged intergranular
contacts vitiate collision theory. The contacts, where all the important
physics takes place, are regarded as quasi-particles that can appear and
disappear. A contact potential, $\nu$, is defined as a measure of the
fluctuations and the mean coordination number per particle and its fluctuations
are calculated as a function of it. This formulation extends the Edwards
statistical mechanics to slow dynamic systems and converges to it when the
motion stops. The theory is applied to a model system of a simply sheared
granular material in the limit of small confining stress. The dependence of the
contact potential on the shear rate is derived, making it possible to calibrate
$\nu$ experimentally and predict the coordination number distribution as a
function of the shear rate. Setting next $\nu=0$ as the jamming point, where
the critical mean coordination number is $z_c$, a finite value is found for the
shear rate there, $\dot{\gamma}_c$. A simple mean field theory then yields the
scaling of the mean coordination number and its fluctuations near
$\dot{\gamma}_c$. Existing results in the literature appear to support the
predictions.

persistent X-ray source 1E1743.1-2843, located in the Galactic Center region.
The source was observed between September and October 2012 by NuSTAR and
XMM-Newton, providing almost simultaneous observations in the hard and soft
X-ray bands. The high X-ray luminosity points to the presence of an accreting
compact object. We analyze the possibilities of this accreting compact object
being either a neutron star (NS) or a black hole, and conclude that the joint
XMM-Newton and NuSTAR spectrum from 0.3 to 40 $\mathrm{keV}$ fits to a black
body spectrum with $kT\sim1.8~\mathrm{keV}$ emitted from a hot spot or an
equatorial strip on a neutron star surface. This spectrum is thermally
Comptonized by electrons with $kT_{e}\sim4.6~\mathrm{keV}$. Accepting this
neutron star hypothesis, we probe the Low Mass (LMXB) or High Mass (HMXB) X-ray
Binary nature of the source. While the lack of Type-I bursts can be explained
in the LMXB scenario, the absence of pulsations in the 2 mHz - 49 Hz frequency
range, the lack of eclipses and of an IR companion, and the lack of a
$K_{\alpha}$ line from neutral or moderately ionized iron strongly disfavor
interpreting this source as a HMXB. We therefore conclude that 1E1743.1-2843 is
most likely a NS-LMXB located beyond the Galactic Center. There is weak
statistical evidence for a soft X-ray excess possibly indicating thermal
emission from an accretion disk. However, the disk normalization remains
unconstrained due to the high hydrogen column density
($N_{H}\sim1.6\times10^{23}~\mathrm{cm^{-2}}$).

trends), indicating the presence of outer companions. Direct imaging

the results of high-contrast imaging observations or six intermediate-mass
giants with long-term RV trends using the Subaru Telescope and HiCIAO camera.
We detected co-moving companions to $\gamma$ Hya B ($0.61^{+0.12}_{-0.14}

exclude companions more massive than 30-60 $M_\mathrm{Jup}$ at projected

companions or unidentified long-period companions can account for the RV trends
observed around the six giants. We find that the Kozai mechanism can explain
the high eccentricity of the inner planets $\iota$ Dra b, HD 5608 b, and HD

biology. Most traditional methods fail to identify functionally equivalent
proteins if they lack similar sequences, structural data or extensive manual
annotations. In this thesis, I focused on feature engineering and machine
learning methods for identifying diverse classes of proteins that share
functional relatedness but little sequence or structural similarity, notably,
Neuropeptide Precursors (NPPs).
  I aim to identify functional protein classes solely using unannotated protein
primary sequences from any organism. This thesis focuses on feature
representations of whole protein sequences, sequence derived engineered
features, their extraction, frameworks for their usage by machine learning (ML)
models, and the application of ML models to biological tasks, focusing on high
level protein functions. I implemented the ideas of feature engineering to
develop a platform (called NeuroPID) that extracts meaningful features for
classification of overlooked NPPs. The platform allows mass discovery of new
NPs and NPPs. It was expanded as a webserver.
  I expanded our approach towards other challenging protein classes. This is
implemented as a novel bioinformatics toolkit called ProFET (Protein Feature
Engineering Toolkit). ProFET extracts hundreds of biophysical and sequence
derived attributes, allowing the application of machine learning methods to
proteins. ProFET was applied on many protein benchmark datasets with state of
the art performance. The success of ProFET applies to a wide range of
high-level functions such as metagenomic analysis, subcellular localization,

  These methods and frameworks represent a valuable resource for using ML and

First, we employ timed relative observability to synthesize a
partial-observation monolithic supervisor; the control actions of this
supervisor include not only disabling action of prohibitible events (as that of
controllable events in the untimed case) but also ""clock-preempting"" action of
forcible events. Accordingly we decompose the supervisor into a set of
partial-observation local controllers one for each prohibitible event, as well
as a set of partial-observation local preemptors one for each forcible event.
We prove that these local controllers and preemptors collectively achieve the
same controlled behavior as the partial-observation monolithic supervisor does.
Moreover, we propose channel models for inter-agent event communication and
impose bounded and unbounded delay as temporal specifications. In this
formulation, there exist multiple distinct observable event sets; thus we
employ timed relative coobservability to synthesize partial-observation
decentralized supervisors, and then localize these supervisors into local
controllers and preemptors. The above results are illustrated by a timed
workcell example.

hidden Lie algebraic structure. So far this structure has resisted
understanding, apart from some progress in the self-dual sector. We show that
there is indeed a Lie algebra behind the YM Feynman rules. The Lie algebra we
uncover is the Drinfeld double of the Lie algebra of vector fields. More
specifically, we show that the kinematic numerators following from the YM
Feynman rules satisfy a version of the Jacobi identity, in that the Jacobiator
of the bracket defined by the YM cubic vertex is cancelled by the contribution
of the YM quartic vertex. We then show that this Jacobi-like identity is in
fact the Jacobi identity of the Drinfeld double. All our considerations are
off-shell. Our construction explains why numerators computed using the Feynman
rules satisfy the colour-kinematics at four but not at higher numbers of
points. It also suggests a way of modifying the Feynman rules so that the
duality can continue to hold for an arbitrary number of gluons. Our
construction stops short of producing explicit higher point numerators because
of an absence of a certain property at four points. We comment on possible ways
of correcting this, but leave the next word in the story to future work.

broken, but despite this, the zero-energy Landau level in BLG survives, albeit
with reduced degeneracy. In addition, we derive effective models for the
low-energy features in the magnetic minibands and demonstrate the appearance of
secondary Dirac points in the valence band, which we confirm by numerical
simulations. Then, we analyze how single-particle gaps in the fractal energy

considering uncertainty in the input space. Grasping unknown objects can be
achieved by using a trial and error exploration strategy. Bayesian optimization
is a sample efficient optimization algorithm that is especially suitable for
this setups as it actively reduces the number of trials for learning about the
function to optimize. In fact, this active object exploration is the same
strategy that infants do to learn optimal grasps. One problem that arises while
learning grasping policies is that some configurations of grasp parameters may
be very sensitive to error in the relative pose between the object and robot
end-effector. We call these configurations unsafe because small errors during
grasp execution may turn good grasps into bad grasps. Therefore, to reduce the
risk of grasp failure, grasps should be planned in safe areas. We propose a new
algorithm, Unscented Bayesian optimization that is able to perform sample
efficient optimization while taking into consideration input noise to find safe
optima. The contribution of Unscented Bayesian optimization is twofold as if
provides a new decision process that drives exploration to safe regions and a
new selection procedure that chooses the optimal in terms of its safety without
extra analysis or computational cost. Both contributions are rooted on the
strong theory behind the unscented transformation, a popular nonlinear
approximation method. We show its advantages with respect to the classical
Bayesian optimization both in synthetic problems and in realistic robot grasp
simulations. The results highlights that our method achieves optimal and robust
grasping policies after few trials while the selected grasps remain in safe
regions.

study the interplay between the dynamical Lamb effect and the energy

of the most striking results is that photon generation from vacuum can be
strongly enhanced due to the qubit relaxation, which opens a new channel for
such a process. We also show that dissipation in the cavity can increase the

spatial-spectral relative-phase and time-delay maps of hyperentangled photons
all over the spontaneous parametric down conversion (SPDC) emission cone. We
consider the hyperentangled-photons produced by superimposing noncollinear SPDC
emissions of two crossed and coherently-pumped nonlinear crystals. We adopt a
vectorial representation for all parameters of concern. This enables us to
study special settings such as the self-compensation via oblique pump
incidence. While rigorous quantum treatment of SPDC emission requires Gaussian
state representation, in low-gain regime (like the case of the study), it is
well approximated to the first order to superposition of vacuum and two-photon
states. The relative phase and time-delay maps are then calculated between the
two-photon wavepackets created along symmetrical locations of the crystals.
Assuming monochromatic plane-wave pump field, the mutual signal-idler relations
like energy conservation and transverse-momentum conservation define well one
of the two-photon with reference to its conjugate. The weaker conservation of
longitudinal momentum (due to relatively thin crystals) allows two-photon
emission directions coplanar with the pump beam while spreading around the
perfect phase-matching direction. While prior works often adopt first-order
approximation, it is shown that the relative-phase map is a very well
approximated to a quadratic function in the polar angle of the two-photon
emission while negligibly varying with the azimuthal angle.

quantification of spectral functions based on the previous knowledge of the

used as weighted coefficients in the smoothing algorithm. This smoothing method
was conceived to be applied in atomic and nuclear spectroscopies preferably to
these techniques where net counts are proportional to acquisition time, such as
particle induced X-ray emission (PIXE) and other X-ray fluorescence
spectroscopic methods, etc. This algorithm, when properly applied, does not
distort the form nor the intensity of the signal, so it is well suited for all
kind of spectroscopic techniques. This method is extremely effective at
reducing high-frequency noise in the signal much more efficient than a single
rectangular smooth of the same width. As all of smoothing techniques, the
proposed method improves the precision of the results, but in this case we
found also a systematic improvement on the accuracy of the results. We still
have to evaluate the improvement on the quality of the results when this method
is applied over real experimental results. We expect better characterization of
the net area quantification of the peaks, and smaller Detection and
Quantification Limits.
  We have applied this method to signals that obey Poisson statistics, but with
the same ideas and criteria, it could be applied to time series. In a general
case, when this algorithm is applied over experimental results, also it would
be required that the sought characteristic functions, required for this
weighted smoothing method, should be obtained from a system with strong
stability. If the sought signals are not perfectly clean, this method should be
carefully applied

identifying the truncation required for passage to finite n. The calculations
rely upon a ladder of long exact cohomology sequences, which arises by
comparing cofibrations associated to the diagonals of the symmetric square and
the corresponding Borel construction. The cofibrations involve classic
configuration spaces of unordered pairs of 1-dimensional subspaces of
$K^{n+1}$, and their one-point compactifications; the latter are identified as
Thom spaces by combining Lowdin's symmetric orthogonalisation process (and its
quaternionic extension) with a dash of Pin geometry. The ensuing integral

generating ultra-fast physically random sequence of bits. For this purpose, we
utilize a dual-channel optical chaos source with suppressed time delayed (TD)
signature in both the intensity and the phase of its two channels. The proposed
technique uses M 1-bit analog-to-digital converters (ADCs) to compare the level
of the chaotic intensity signal at time t with its levels after incommensurable
delay-interval Tm, where m = {1,2,...,M}. The binary output of each 1-bit ADC
is then sampled by a positive-edge-triggered D flip-flop. The clock sequence
applied to the flip-flops is relatively delayed such that the rising edge of
the clock triggering the m flip-flop precedes the rising edge of the clock of a
subsequent m+1 flip-flop by a fixed period. The outputs of all flip-flops are
then combined by means of a parity-check logic. Numerical simulations are
carried out using values of parameters at which TD signature is suppressed for
chosen values of setup parameters. The 15 statistical tests in Special
Publication 800-22 from NIST are applied to the generated random bits in order
to examine the randomness quality of these bits for different values of M. The
results show that all tests are passed from M = 1 to M = 39 at sampling rate up

2.691 Tb/sec using a chaotic source of single VCSEL and without employing any

observe the vertical column of cloud and aerosol scattering properties.
Detector and solar background noise, however, hinder the ability of lidar
systems to provide reliable backscatter and extinction cross-section estimates.
Standard methods for solving this inverse problem are most effective with high
signal-to-noise ratio observations that are only available at low-resolution in
uniform scenes. This paper describes a novel method for solving the inverse
problem with high-resolution, lower signal-to-noise ratio observations that are
effective in non-uniform scenes. The novelty is twofold. First, the inference
of the backscatter and extinction are done on images, whereas current lidar
algorithms only use the information content of single profiles. Hence, the
latent spatial and temporal information in the noisy images are utilized to
infer the cross-sections. Second, the noise associated with photon-counting
lidar observations can be modeled using a Poisson distribution, and
state-of-the-art tools for solving Poisson inverse problems are adapted to the
atmospheric lidar problem. It is demonstrated through photon-counting High
Spectral Resolution Lidar (HSRL) simulations that the proposed algorithm yield
inverted backscatter and extinction cross-sections (per unit volume) with
smaller Mean Squared Error (MSE) values at higher spatial and temporal
resolutions, compared to the standard approach. Two case studies of real
experimental data are also provided where the proposed algorithm is applied on
HSRL observations and the inverted backscatter and extinction cross-sections
are compared against the standard approach.

cluster-expansion technique has been recently employed to derive an effective
interaction from a realistic nuclear Hamiltonian. One of the main objectives of
the work described in this Thesis is establishing the accuracy of this novel
approach--that allows to combine the flexibility of perturbation theory in the
basis of eigenstates of the noninteracting system with a realistic description
of short-range correlations in coordinate space--by focusing on the hard-sphere
fermion system.
  As a first application of the formalism, the quasiparticle properties of hard
spheres of degeneracy four have been determined from the two-point Green's
function. The calculation has been performed carrying out a perturbative
expansion of the self-energy, up to the second order in the CBF effective
interaction. The main results of this study are the momentum distributions, the
quasiparticle spectra and their description in terms of effective mass.
  The investigation of the hard-sphere fermion fluid has been extended to study
the shear viscosity and thermal conductivity coefficients of the system with
degeneracy two, that can be regarded as a model of pure neutron matter. The
resulting transport coefficients show a strong sensitivity to the quasiparticle
effective mass, reflecting the effect of second order contributions to the
self-energy which are not taken into account in nuclear matter studies
available in the literature. The difference between first and second order
results is likely to play an important role in astrophysical applications and
needs to be carefully investigated extending our analysis to nuclear matter.

in computer-aided manufacturing. When cutting away a region from a solid piece
of material -- such as steel, wood, ceramics, or plastic -- using a rough tool
in a milling machine, sharp convex corners of the region cannot be done
properly, but have to be left for finer tools that are more expensive to use.
We want to determine a toolpath that maximizes the use of the rough tool. In
order to formulate the problem in mathematical terms, we introduce the notion
of bounded convex curvature. A region of points in the plane $Q$ has
\emph{bounded convex curvature} if for any point $x\in\partial Q$, there is a
unit disk $U$ and $\varepsilon>0$ such that $x\in \partial U$ and all points in
$U$ within distance $\varepsilon$ from $x$ are in $Q$. This translates to
saying that as we traverse the boundary $\partial Q$ with the interior of $Q$
on the left side, then $\partial Q$ turns to the left with curvature at most
$1$. There is no bound on the curvature where $\partial Q$ turns to the right.
Given a region of points $P$ in the plane, we are now interested in computing
the maximum subset $Q\subseteq P$ of bounded convex curvature. The difference
in the requirement to left- and right-curvature is a natural consequence of
different conditions when machining convex and concave areas of $Q$. We devise
an algorithm to compute the unique maximum such set $Q$, when the boundary of
$P$ consists of $n$ line segments and circular arcs of arbitrary radii. In the
general case where $P$ may have holes, the algorithm runs in time $O(n^2)$ and
uses $O(n)$ space. If $P$ is simply-connected, we describe a faster $O(n\log
n)$ time algorithm.

coupling. In the stable helicoid regime, quantitative agreement with
experimental data is obtained. When twisted above a critical twist $\eta_L(T)$,
ribbons develop wrinkles and folds which modify qualitatively the mechanical
behavior. We show a surprisingly large longitudinal contraction upon twist,
reminiscent of a Poynting effect, and a much lower torsional stiffness. Far
from threshold, we identify two regimes depending on the applied $T$. In a
high-$T$ regime, we find that the torque scales as $\eta\cdot T$ and the
contraction as $\eta^2$, in agreement with a far from threshold analysis where
compression and bending stresses are neglected. In a low-$T$ regime, the
contraction still scales as $\eta^2$ but the torque appears $T$-independent and
linear with $\eta$. We argue that the large curvature of the folds now
contribute significantly to the torque. This regime is discussed in the context
of asymptotic isometry for very thin plates submitted to vanishing tension but
large change of shape, as in crumpling.

scaled variance of the multiplicity distribution is an intensive quantity, but
is sensitive to the volume fluctuation of the system. The importance of the
choice of narrow centrality bins and the corrections of centrality bin width
effect for controlling volume fluctuations have been discussed. It is observed
that the mean and width of the multiplicity distributions monotonically
increase as a function of increasing centrality at all collision energies,

temperature. Our results show that the 4 loop contribution can become larger
than the 3 loop term when the coupling is large. This indicates a breakdown of
the 2PI approach, and the need for higher order $n$PI approximations. In
addition, our results demonstrate the renormalizability of 2PI calculations at
the 4 loop level. This is interesting because the counterterm structure of the
2PI theory at 4 loops is different from the structure at $n\le 3$ loops. Two
vertex counterterms are required at the 4 loop level, but not at lower loop
order. This unique feature of the 2PI theory has not previously been verified
numerically.

Peccei-Quinn symmetry breaking operators, the effective strong CP phase remains
sufficiently small in contrast to the standard axion models without the

symmetry breaking operators, which can significantly affect the axion
cosmology. When the axions are trapped in different minima, domain walls appear
and their scaling behavior suppresses the axion isocurvature perturbations at
super-horizon scales. Our scenario predicts many axions and saxions coupled to

the recently found diphoton excess at 750 GeV could be due to one of such

Deterministic Network Calculus (DNC) can compute a worst-case bound on a data
flow's end-to-end delay. Accuracy of DNC results has been improved steadily,
resulting in two DNC branches: the classical algebraic analysis and the more
recent optimization-based analysis. The optimization-based branch provides a
theoretical solution for tight bounds. Its computational cost grows, however,
(possibly super-)exponentially with the network size. Consequently, a heuristic
optimization formulation trading accuracy against computational costs was
proposed. In this paper, we challenge optimization-based DNC with a new
algebraic DNC algorithm.
  We show that: (i) no current optimization formulation scales well with the
network size and (ii) algebraic DNC can be considerably improved in both
aspects, accuracy and computational cost. To that end, we contribute a novel
DNC algorithm that transfers the optimization's search for best attainable
delay bounds to algebraic DNC. It achieves a high degree of accuracy and our
novel efficiency improvements reduce the cost of the analysis dramatically. In
extensive numerical experiments, we observe that our delay bounds deviate from
the optimization-based ones by only 1.142% on average while computation times
simultaneously decrease by several orders of magnitude.

two complementary methods for computing the quasinormal modes of spherically

continued-fraction method. We extend these techniques to dealing with generic
coupled systems of linear equations, with the only assumption being the
interaction between different fields is effectively localized within a finite
region. In particular, we adapt the continued-fraction method to include cases
where a series solution can be obtained only outside an effective region. As an
application, we compute the polar quasinormal modes of boson stars by using the
continued-fraction method for the first time. The methods discussed here can be
applied to other situations in which the perturbations effectively couple only
within a finite region of space.

second neighbors is frustrated for either sign of J1 and has a singlet ground
state (GS) for J1/J2 $\ge - 4$. Its rich quantum phase diagram supports
gapless, gapped, commensurate (C), incommensurate (IC) and other phases.
Critical points J1/J2 are evaluated using exact diagonalization (ED) and
density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) calculations. The wave vector $q_G$
of spin correlations is related to GS degeneracy and obtained as the peak of
the spin structure factor $S(q)$. Variable $q_G$ indicates IC phases in two
$J1/J2$ intervals, [ -4, -1.24] and [0.44, 2], and a C-IC point at J1/J2 = 2.
The decoupled C phase in [-1.24, 0.44] has constant $q_G = {\pi}/2$,
nondegenerate GS, and a lowest triplet state with broken spin density on
sublattices of odd and even numbered sites. The lowest triplet and singlet
excitations, $E_m$ and $E_{\sigma}$, are degenerate in finite systems at
specific frustration $J1/J2$. Level crossing extrapolates in the thermodynamic
limit to the same critical points as $q_G$. The $S(q)$ peak diverges at $q_G =
{\pi}$ in the gapless phase with $J1/J2 > 4.148$ and quasi-long-range order
(QLRO({$\pi$})). $S(q)$ diverges at $\pm {\pi}/2$ in the decoupled phase with
QLRO({$\pi$}/2), but is finite in gapped phases with finite range correlations.
Numerical results and field theory agree at small $J2/J1$ but disagree for the
decoupled phase with weak exchange $J1$ between sublattices. Two related models
are summarized: one has an exact gapless decoupled phase with QLRO({$\pi$}/2)
and no IC phases; the other has a single IC phase without a decoupled phase in
between.

(TIs) are characterized by the universal magnetoelectric $E\cdot B$ term
constituent of the Lagrangian formalism. The quantized magnetoelectric
coupling, which is generally referred to as topological magnetoelectric (TME)
effect, has been predicted to induce exotic phenomena including the universal
low-energy magneto-optical effects. Here we report the experimental
demonstration of the long-sought TME effect, which is exemplified by
magneto-optical Faraday and Kerr rotations in the quantum anomalous Hall (QAH)
states of magnetic TI surfaces by terahertz magneto-optics. The universal
relation composed of the observed Faraday and Kerr rotation angles but not of
any material parameters (e.g. dielectric constant and magnetic susceptibility)
well exhibits the trajectory toward the fine structure constant $\alpha$ $(=
2\pi e^2/hc \sim 1/137)$ in the quantized limit. Our result will pave a way for
versatile TME effects with emergent topological functions.

compounds at the verge of a metal-insulator transition. Although their crystal
structure is composed of similar building blocks, our analysis shows that the
two materials exhibit a very different effective dimensionality, LaMnAsO being
a quasi-two-dimensional material in contrast to the much more three-dimensional
BaMn$_2$As$_2$. We demonstrate that the experimentally observed differences in
the N\'eel temperature, the band gap, and the optical properties of the
manganese compounds under consideration can be traced back to exactly this
effective dimensionality. Our calculations show excellent agreement with

describes processes of physical emergence relating an assumed sub-quantum
physics to macroscopic boundary conditions. The latter can be shown to entail
top-down causation, in addition to usual bottom-up scenarios. With this example
it is demonstrated that definitions of ""realism"" in the literature are simply
too restrictive. A prevailing manner to define realism in quantum mechanics is
in terms of pre-determination independent of the measurement. With our
counter-example, which actually is ubiquitous in emergent, or self-organizing,
systems, we argue for realism without pre-determination. We refer to earlier
results of our group showing how the guiding equation of the de Broglie-Bohm
interpretation can be derived from a theory with classical ingredients only.
Essentially, this corresponds to a ""quantum mechanics without wave functions""
in ordinary 3-space, albeit with nonlocal correlations.
  This, then, leads to the central question of how to deal with the nonlocality
problem in a relativistic setting. We here show that a basic argument
discussing the allegedly paradox time ordering of events in EPR-type
two-particle experiments falls short of taking into account the contextuality
of the experimental setup. Consequently, we then discuss under which
circumstances (i.e. physical premises) superluminal information transfer (but
not signaling) may be compatible with a Lorentz-invariant theory. Finally, we
argue that the impossibility of superluminal signaling - despite the presence
of superluminal information transfer - is not the result of some sort of
conspiracy (a la ""Nature likes to hide""), but the consequence of the
impossibility to exactly reproduce in repeated experimental runs a state's
preparation, or of the no-cloning theorem, respectively.

fabricated on flexible graphene substrates. Dendritic integrations in both
spatial and temporal modes were successfully emulated, and spatiotemporal
correlated logics were obtained. A proof-of-principle visual system model for
emulating lobula giant motion detector neuron was investigated. Our results are
of great interest for flexible neuromorphic cognitive systems.
