governed via a probability distribution on random matrices. Specifically, we
employ a matrix variate Gaussian \cite{gupta1999matrix} parameter posterior
distribution where we explicitly model the covariance among the input and
output dimensions of each layer. Furthermore, with approximate covariance
matrices we can achieve a more efficient way to represent those correlations
that is also cheaper than fully factorized parameter posteriors. We further
show that with the ""local reprarametrization trick""
\cite{kingma2015variational} on this posterior distribution we arrive at a
Gaussian Process \cite{rasmussen2006gaussian} interpretation of the hidden
units in each layer and we, similarly with \cite{gal2015dropout}, provide
connections with deep Gaussian processes. We continue in taking advantage of
this duality and incorporate ""pseudo-data"" \cite{snelson2005sparse} in our
model, which in turn allows for more efficient sampling while maintaining the
properties of the original model. The validity of the proposed approach is
verified through extensive experiments.

hydrogen, and the opacity from dust is also low, as in primeval galaxies and
local dwarf irregular galaxies, CO forms slowly and is easily destroyed, so it
is difficult for it to accumulate inside dense clouds. Here we report
interferometric observations of CO clouds in the local group dwarf irregular
galaxy Wolf-Lundmark-Melotte (WLM), which has a metallicity that is 13% of the
solar value and 50% lower than the previous CO detection threshold. The clouds
are tiny compared to the surrounding atomic and H_2 envelopes, but they have
typical densities and column densities for CO clouds in the Milky Way. The
normal CO density explains why star clusters forming in dwarf irregulars have
similar densities to star clusters in giant spiral galaxies. The low cloud
masses suggest that these clusters will also be low mass, unless some
galaxy-scale compression occurs, such as an impact from a cosmic cloud or other
galaxy. If the massive metal-poor globular clusters in the halo of the Milky

generates interesting and important patterns in the mono-$Z$ plus missing $E_T$

obtained from the Higgs portal DM models within the effective field theories.
In addition, we show that it would be possible to distinguish the spin of DM in

two states. When an arm is sampled, the state of the arm is not available to
the sampler. Instead, a binary signal with a known randomness that depends on
the state of the arm is available. No signal is available if the arm is not
sampled. An arm-dependent reward is accrued from each sampling. In each time
step, each arm changes state according to known transition probabilities which
in turn depend on whether the arm is sampled or not sampled. Since the state of
the arm is never visible and has to be inferred from the current belief and a
possible binary signal, we call this the hidden Markov bandit. Our interest is
in a policy to select the arm(s) in each time step that maximizes the infinite
horizon discounted reward. Specifically, we seek the use of Whittle's index in
selecting the arms. We first analyze the single-armed bandit and show that in
general, it admits an approximate threshold-type optimal policy when there is a
positive reward for the `no-sample' action. We also identify several special
cases for which the threshold policy is indeed the optimal policy. Next, we
show that such a single-armed bandit also satisfies an approximate-indexability
property. For the case when the single-armed bandit admits a threshold-type
optimal policy, we perform the calculation of the Whittle index for each arm.
Numerical examples illustrate the analytical results.

We find that the photodetachment rate is unaffected by a weak terahertz field,

types of closed classical orbits are identified for the photoelectron motion in
a strong single-cycle terahertz pulse, and their connections with the
oscillatory photodetachment rate are established quantitatively by generalizing
the standard closed-orbit theory to a time-dependent form. By comparing the

which are different with topological insulators. They are characterized by the
topological stability of Fermi surface, whether it encloses band crossing
point, i.e., Dirac cone like energy node, or not. They are distinguished from
each other by the degeneracy and momentum space distribution of the nodal
points. To realize these intriguing topological quantum states is quite
challenging and crucial to both fundamental science and future application. In
2012 and 2013, Na$_3$Bi and Cd$_3$As$_2$ were theoretically predicted to be
DSM, respectively. Their experimental verifications in 2014 have ignited the
hot and intensive studies on TSMs. The following theoretical prediction of
nonmagnetic WSM in TaAs family stimulated a second wave and many experimental
works have come out in this year. In 2014, a kind of three dimensional crystal
of carbon has been proposed to be NLSM due to negligible spin-orbit coupling
and coexistence of time-reversal and inversion symmetry. Though the final
experimental confirmation of NLSM is still missing, there have been several
theoretical proposals, including Cu$_3$PdN from us. In the final part, we have

observed. We present two-dimensional, axisymmetric hydrodynamical simulations
of a representative sample of stellar wind bow shocks from Galactic OB stars in
an ambient medium of densities ranging from n_ISM=0.01 up to 10.0/cm3.
Independently of their location in the Galaxy, we confirm that the infrared is
the most appropriated waveband to search for bow shocks from massive stars.
Their spectral energy distribution is the convenient tool to analyze them since
their emission does not depend on the temporary effects which could affect
unstable, thin-shelled bow shocks. Our numerical models of Galactic bow shocks
generated by high-mass (~40 Mo) runaway stars yield H$\alpha$ fluxes which
could be observed by facilities such as the SuperCOSMOS H-Alpha Survey. The
brightest bow shock nebulae are produced in the denser regions of the ISM. We
predict that bow shocks in the field observed at Ha by means of
Rayleigh-sensitive facilities are formed around stars of initial mass larger
than about 20 Mo. Our models of bow shocks from OB stars have the emission
maximum in the wavelength range 3 <= lambda <= 50 micrometer which can be up to
several orders of magnitude brighter than the runaway stars themselves,

by the value of an internal variable varying with time (e.g. size, weight, and
protein concentration) is typically modeled by a Population Balance Equation, a
first order linear hyperbolic partial differential equation. The
characteristics described by internal variables usually vary monotonically with
the passage of time. A particular difficulty appears when the characteristic
curves exhibit different slopes from each other and therefore cross each other
at certain times. In particular such crossing phenomenon occurs during T-cells
immune response when the concentrations of protein expressions depend upon each

involved which is shared by all T-cells. At these crossing points, the linear
advection equation is not possible by using the classical way of hyperbolic
conservation laws. Therefore, a new Transport Method is introduced in this
article which allowed us to find the population density function for such

complex heterogeneous geological formations. Such domains are most accurately
represented in reservoir simulations by unstructured computational grids.
Finite element methods accurately describe flow on unstructured meshes with
complex geometries, and their flexible formulation allows implementation on
different grid types. In this work, we consider for the first time the
challenging problem of fully compositional three-phase flow in 3D unstructured
grids, discretized by any combination of tetrahedra, prisms, and hexahedra. We
employ a mass conserving mixed hybrid finite element (MHFE) method to solve for
the pressure and flux fields. The transport equations are approximated with a
higher-order vertex-based discontinuous Galerkin (DG) discretization. We show
that this approach outperforms a face-based implementation of the same
polynomial order. These methods are well suited for heterogeneous and fractured
reservoirs, because they provide globally continuous pressure and flux fields,
while allowing for sharp discontinuities in compositions and saturations. The
higher-order accuracy improves the modeling of strongly non-linear flow, such
as gravitational and viscous fingering. We review the literature on
unstructured reservoir simulation models, and present many examples that
consider gravity depletion, water flooding, and gas injection in oil saturated
reservoirs. We study convergence rates, mesh sensitivity, and demonstrate the
wide applicability of our chosen finite element methods for challenging
multiphase flow problems in geometrically complex subsurface media.

different interventions interact to reduce transmission becomes critical. The
Lake Kariba area of Southern Province, Zambia, is part of a multi-country

interconnected region of variable transmission intensities.
  Methods In 2012-13, six rounds of mass-screen-and-treat drug campaigns were
carried out in the Lake Kariba region. A spatial dynamical model of malaria
transmission in the Lake Kariba area, with transmission and climate modeled at
the village scale, was calibrated to the 2012-13 prevalence survey data, with
case management rates, insecticide-treated net usage, and drug campaign
coverage informed by surveillance. The model was used to simulate the effect of
various interventions implemented in 2014-22 on reducing regional transmission,
achieving elimination by 2022, and maintaining elimination through 2028.
  Findings The model captured the spatio-temporal trends of decline and rebound
in malaria prevalence in 2012-13 at the village scale. Simulations predicted
that elimination required repeated mass drug administrations coupled with
simultaneous increase in net usage. Drug campaigns targeted only at high-burden
areas were as successful as campaigns covering the entire region.
  Interpretation Elimination in the Lake Kariba region is possible through
coordinating mass drug campaigns with high-coverage vector control. Targeting
regional hotspots is a viable alternative to global campaigns when human
migration within an interconnected area is responsible for maintaining
transmission in low-burden areas.

inherent problem in this effort is that humans lack the mental capacity to
truly understand spaces exceeding three spatial dimensions. To keep within this
limitation, we describe a framework that decomposes a high-dimensional data
space into a continuum of generalized 3D subspaces. Analysts can then explore
these 3D subspaces individually via the familiar trackball interface, but using
additional facilities to smoothly transition to adjacent subspaces for expanded
space comprehension. Since the number of such subspaces suffers from
combinatorial explosion, we provide a set of data-driven subspace selection and
navigation tools which can guide users to interesting subspaces and views. A
subspace trail map allows users to manage the explored subspaces, and also
helps them navigate within and across any higher-dimensional subspaces
identified by clustering. Both trackball and trail map are each embedded into a
word cloud of attribute labels, sized according to the relevance of the
associated data dimensions in the currently selected subspace. Finally, a view
gallery helps users keep their bearings and return to interesting subspaces and
views. We demonstrate our system via several use cases in a diverse set of
application areas, such as cluster analysis and refinement, information
discovery, and supervised training of classifiers.

method uses an analytical galaxy model and makes a Bayesian marginalisation of
the likelihood over uninteresting parameters. It has the feature of working
directly in the visibility domain, which is the natural approach to adopt with
radio interferometer data, avoiding systematics introduced by the imaging
process. As a proof of concept, we provide results for visibility simulations
of individual galaxies with flux density S >= 10 muJy at the phase centre of
the proposed SKA1-MID baseline configuration, adopting 12 frequency channels in
the band 950 - 1190 MHz. Weak lensing shear measurements from a population of
galaxies with realistic flux and scalelength distributions are obtained after
natural gridding of the raw visibilities. Shear measurements are expected to be
affected by ""noise bias"": we estimate the bias in the method as a function of
signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). We obtain additive and multiplicative bias values
that are comparable to SKA1 requirements for SNR > 18 and SNR > 30,

similar shear measurement calibration strategies to those used for optical

Finding good correspondences between the parts of $\mathcal{P}$ and those of
$\mathcal{P}'$ is helpful in classification, pattern recognition, and network
analysis. Unlike common similarity measures for partitions that yield only a
single value, we provide specifics on how $\mathcal{P}$ and $\mathcal{P'}$
correspond to each other.
  To this end, we first define natural collections of best correspondences
under three constraints \cone, \ctwo, and \cthree. In case of \cone, the best
correspondences form a minimum cut basis of a certain bipartite graph, whereas
the other two lead to minimum cut bases of $\mathcal{P}$ \wrt $\mathcal{P}'$.
We also introduce a constraint, \cfour, which tightens \cthree; both are useful
for finding consensus partitions. We then develop branch-and-bound algorithms
for finding minimum $P_s$-$P_t$ cuts of $\mathcal{P}$ and thus $\vert
\mathcal{P} \vert -1$ best correspondences under \ctwo, \cthree, and \cfour,
respectively.
  In a case study, we use the correspondences to gain insight into a community
detection algorithm. The results suggest, among others, that only very minor
losses in the quality of the correspondences occur if the branch-and-bound
algorithm is restricted to its greedy core. Thus, even for graphs with more
than half a million nodes and hundreds of communities, we can find hundreds of
best or almost best correspondences in less than a minute.

segregation in a simple model of mobile agents, endowed with a continuous
opinion variable. In the model, physical proximity determines a progressive
convergence of opinions but differing opinions result in agents moving away
from each others. This feedback between mobility and social dynamics determines
to the onset of a stable dynamical metapopulation scenario where physically
separated groups of like-minded individuals interact with each other through
the exchange of agents. The further introduction of confirmation bias in social
interactions, defined as the tendency of an individual to favor opinions that
match his own, leads to the emergence of echo chambers where different opinions
can coexist also within the same group. We believe that the model may be of
interest to researchers investigating the origin of segregation in the offline

phases of matter. While rotational symmetry breaking is one of the most
prevalent examples, the rich landscape of orientational orders breaking the
rotational symmetries of isotropic space, i.e. $O(3)$, to a three-dimensional
point group remain largely unexplored, apart from simple examples such as
ferromagnetic or uniaxial nematic ordering. Here we provide an explicit
construction, utilizing a recently introduced gauge theoretical framework, to
address the three-dimensional point-group-symmetric orientational orders on a
general footing. This unified approach allows us to enlist order parameter
tensors for all three dimensional point groups. By construction, these tensor
order parameters are the minimal set of simplest tensors allowed by the
symmetries that uniquely characterize the orientational order. We explicitly
give these for the point groups $\{C_n, D_n, T, O, I\} \subset SO(3)$ and
$\{C_{nv}, S_n, C_{nh}, D_{nh}, D_{nd}, T_h, T_d, O_h, I_h\}\subset O(3)$ for
$n=\{1,2,3,4,6, \infty\}$. This central result may be perceived as a roadmap
for identifying exotic orientational orders that may become more and more in
reach in view of rapid experimental progress in e.g. nano-colloidal systems and
novel magnets.

ND-Tree) for the dynamic non-dominance problem, i.e. the problem of online
update of a Pareto archive composed of mutually non-dominated points. It uses a
new ND-Tree data structure in which each node represents a subset of points
contained in a hyperrectangle defined by its local approximate ideal and nadir
points. By building subsets containing points located close in the objective
space and using basic properties of the local ideal and nadir points we can
efficiently avoid searching many branches in the tree. ND-Tree may be used in
multiobjective evolutionary algorithms and other multiobjective metaheuristics
to update an archive of potentially non-dominated points. We prove that the
proposed algorithm has sub-linear time complexity under mild assumptions. We
experimentally compare ND-Tree to the simple list, Quad-tree, and M-Front
methods using artificial and realistic benchmarks with up to 10 objectives and
show that with this new method substantial reduction of the number of point
comparisons and computational time can be obtained. Furthermore, we apply the
method to the non-dominated sorting problem showing that it is highly
competitive to some recently proposed algorithms dedicated to this problem.

hidden symmetries within the Landau paradigm. After mapping of the spin
Hamiltonians onto the tight-binding models with Dirac or Majorana fermions and,
when necessary, the mean-field approximation, the analysis can be done
analytically. By utilizing duality transformations the calculation of nonlocal
string order parameters is mapped onto the local order problem in some dual
representation and done without further approximations. Calculated phase
diagrams, phase boundaries, order parameters and their symmetries for each of
the phases provide a comprehensive quantitative Landau description of the
quantum critical properties of the models considered. Complementarily, the
phases with hidden orders can also be distinguished by the Pontryagin (winding)
numbers which we have calculated as well. This unified framework can be
straightforwardly applied for various spin chains and ladders, topological
insulators and superconductors. Applications to other systems are under way.

substitutionally ($\alpha$-Sn) in the Ge lattice, a second significant fraction
corresponds to the Sn-vacancy defect complex in the split-vacancy configuration
( $\beta$-Sn ), in agreement with our previous theoretical study [Ventura et
al., Phys. Rev. B 79, 155202 (2009)]. Here, we present our electronic structure
calculation for Ge$_{1-x}$Sn$_{x}$, including substitutional $\alpha$-Sn as
well as non-substitutional $\beta$-Sn defects. To include the presence of
non-substitutional complex defects in the electronic structure calculation for
this multi-orbital alloy problem, we extended the approach for the purely
substitutional alloy by Jenkins and Dow [Jenkins and Dow, Phys. Rev. B 36, 7994
(1987)]. We employed an effective substitutional two-site cluster equivalent to
the real non-substitutional $\beta$-Sn defect, which was determined by a
Green's functions calculation. We then calculated the electronic structure of
the effective alloy purely in terms of substitutional defects, embedding the
effective substitutional clusters in the lattice. Our results describe the two
transitions of the fundamental gap of Ge$_{1-x}$Sn$_{x}$ as a function of the
total Sn-concentration: namely from an indirect to a direct gap, first, and the
metallization transition at higher $x$. They also highlight the role of
$\beta$-Sn in the reduction of the concentration range which corresponds to the
direct-gap phase of this alloy, of interest for optoelectronics applications.

that it is beneficial to incorporate knowledge of modulation type into

precoding (beamforming) specific to BPSK modulation, which has maximum power
efficiency and capacity in poor channel conditions. To be more specific, in a
multiuser scenario, an objective function is formulated based on the weighted
sum of error probabilities of BPSK modulated users. Convex optimization is used
to transform and solve this ill-behaved non-convex minimum probability of error
(MPE) precoding problem. Numerical results confirm significant performance
improvement. We then develop a low-complexity user selection algorithm for MPE
precoding. Based on line packing principles in Grassmannian manifolds, the
number of supported users is able to exceed the number of transmit antennas,
and hence the proposed approach is able to support more simultaneous users
compared with existing multiuser transmit precoding methods.

stretching or compressing induces a fast decaying stage (FDS) during which the

following the Green-Kubo formula shows a truncation-time independent window,
implying a system-size independent conductivity. Stretching or compressing also
changes the exponent of the power-law tail of the HCAF. The complicated heat
conduction behavior induced by stretching or compressing can be connected to

stationary black holes that are not necessarily spherically symmetric. We
propose boundary conditions for the near horizon region of these black holes
that lead to a surprisingly simple near horizon symmetry algebra consisting of
two affine u(1) current algebras. The symmetry algebra is essentially
equivalent to the Heisenberg algebra. The associated charges give a specific
example of ""soft hair"" on the horizon, as defined by Hawking, Perry and
Strominger. We show that soft hair does not contribute to the
Bekenstein-Hawking entropy of Banados-Teitelboim-Zanelli black holes and ""black
flower"" generalizations. From the near horizon perspective the conformal
generators at asymptotic infinity appear as composite operators, which we
interpret in the spirit of black hole complementarity. Another remarkable
feature of our boundary conditions is that they are singled out by requiring
that the whole spectrum is compatible with regularity at the horizon,
regardless the value of the global charges like mass or angular momentum.
Finally, we address black hole microstates and generalizations to cosmological
horizons.

following FRB 150418, and interpreted it as the afterglow of the FRB. Williams
\& Berger, on the other hand, suggested that the radio transient is analogous
to a group of variable radio sources, so that it could be a coincident AGN
flare in the observational beam of the FRB. A new observation with VLA showed a
re-brightening, which is consistent with the AGN picture. Here, using the radio
survey data of Ofek et al., we statistically examine the chance coincidence
probability to produce an event like the FRB 150418 transient. We find that the
probabilities to produce a variable radio transient with at least the same
variability amplitude and signal-to-noise ratio as the FRB 150415 transient,
without and with the VLA point, are $P_1 \sim 6 \times 10^{-4}$ and $P_1 \sim 2
\times 10^{-3}$, respectively. In addition, the chance probability to have a
fading transient detected following a random time (FRB time) is less than $P_2
\sim 10^{-2.9\pm 1.3}$. Putting these together and assuming that the number of
radio sources within one Parkes beam is 16, the final chance coincidence of
having an FRB 150418-like radio transient to be unrelated to the FRB is $<
10^{-4.9\pm1.3}$ and $< 10^{-4.4\pm1.3}$, respectively, without and with the
VLA point. We conclude that the radio transient following FRB 150418 has a low
probability being an unrelated AGN flare, and the possibility of being the
afterglow of FRB 150418 is not ruled out.

$F_{t}$ exactly. Massam and Wang (2015) found an outer approximation to $F_t$
using a collection of sub-models of the original model. This paper refines the
methodology to find an outer approximation and devises a new methodology to
find an inner approximation. The inner approximation is given not in terms of a
face of the marginal polytope, but in terms of a subset of the vertices of
$F_t$.
  Knowing $F_t$ exactly indicates which cell probabilities have maximum
likelihood estimates equal to $0$. When $F_t$ cannot be obtained exactly, we
can use, first, the outer approximation $F_2$ to reduce the dimension of the
problem and, then, the inner approximation $F_1$ to obtain correct estimates of
cell probabilities corresponding to elements of $F_1$ and improve the estimates
of the remaining probabilities corresponding to elements in $F_2\setminus F_1$.
Using both real-world and simulated data, we illustrate our results, and show
that our methodology scales to high dimensions.

particular, we focus on the lowest-order unstable configuration consisting of
two minima and two maxima of the magnetic vector potential. Breaking of the
initial symmetry leads to exponential growth of the electric energy and to the
formation of two current layers, which is consistent with the picture of
'X-point collapse' first described by Syrovatskii. Magnetic reconnection within
the layers heats a fraction of particles to very high energies. After the
saturation of the linear instability, the current layers are disrupted and the
system evolves chaotically, diffusing the particle energies in a stochastic
second-order Fermi process leading to the formation of power-law energy
distributions. The power-law slopes harden with the increasing mean
magnetization, but they are significantly softer than those produced in
simulations initiated from Harris-type layers. The maximum particle energy is
proportional to the mean magnetization, which is attributed partly to the
increase of the effective electric field and partly to the increase of the
acceleration time scale. We describe in detail the evolving structure of the
dynamical current layers, and report on the conservation of magnetic helicity.
These results can be applied to highly magnetized astrophysical environments,
where ideal plasma instabilities trigger rapid magnetic dissipation with
efficient particle acceleration and flares of high-energy radiation.

the neutralino mass lies within less than 100 GeV of the gluino mass. Thus a
measurement of the gluino mass in the gluino-neutralino coannihilation region
will provide a determination of the neutralino mass. In this region the
neutralino is dominantly a gaugino and the spin-independent proton-neutralino
cross section is small but much larger than the neutrino floor lying in the

Assuming models with log-normal scatter about a median relation of the form
$M_\star \propto M_\mathrm{halo}^\alpha$, the preferred log-slope steepens from
$\alpha \simeq 1.8$ in the limit of zero scatter to $\alpha \simeq 2.6$ in the
case of $2$ dex of scatter in $M_\star$ at fixed halo mass. We provide fitting
functions for the best-fit relations as a function of scatter, including cases
where the relation becomes increasingly stochastic with decreasing mass. We
show that if the scatter at fixed halo mass is large enough ($\gtrsim 1$ dex)
and if the median relation is steep enough ($\alpha \gtrsim 2$), then the

formation in the literature. Though simulation-to-simulation scatter in

massive enough to be considered at least a planetary embryo. The putative
collision suffered by the proto-Earth that created the Moon is a prime example,
though most Solar System bodies bear signatures of such collisions. Current
planet formation models predict that an epoch of giant impacts may be
inevitable, and observations of debris around other stars are providing
mounting evidence that giant impacts feature in the evolution of many planetary
systems. This chapter reviews giant impacts, focussing on what we can learn
about planet formation by studying debris around other stars. Giant impact
debris evolves through mutual collisions and dynamical interactions with
planets. General aspects of this evolution are outlined, noting the importance
of the collision-point geometry. The detectability of the debris is discussed
using the example of the Moon-forming impact. Such debris could be detectable
around another star up to 10Myr post-impact, but model uncertainties could
reduce detectability to a few 100yr window. Nevertheless the 3% of young stars
with debris at levels expected during terrestrial planet formation provide
valuable constraints on formation models; implications for super-Earth
formation are also discussed. Variability recently observed in some bright
disks promises to illuminate the evolution during the earliest phases when
vapour condensates may be optically thick and acutely affected by the
collision-point geometry. The outer reaches of planetary systems may also
exhibit signatures of giant impacts, such as the clumpy debris structures seen

from the literature. Our analysis accounts for differences in aperture size,
solar abundance, and cosmology, and scales all measurements using customised
radial profiles for the temperature (T), gas density, and iron abundance (Z).
We then compare this dataset to groups and clusters in the L-Galaxies galaxy
evolution model.
  Our homogenised dataset reveals a tight T-Z relation for clusters, with a
scatter in Z of only 0.10 dex and a slight negative gradient. After examining
potential measurement biases, we conclude that at least some of this negative
gradient has a physical origin. Our model suggests greater accretion of
hydrogen in the hottest systems, via stripping of gas from infalling
satellites, as a cause. At lower temperatures, L-Galaxies over-estimates Z in
groups, indicating that metal-rich gas removal (via e.g. AGN feedback) is
required.
  L-Galaxies provides a reasonable match to the observed Z in the intracluster
medium (ICM) of the hottest clusters from at least z ~ 1.3 to 0.3. This is
achieved without needing to modify any of the galactic chemical evolution (GCE)
model parameters. However, the Z in intermediate-temperature clusters appears
to be under-estimated in our model at z = 0. The merits and problems with
modifying the GCE modelling to correct this are discussed.

appreciable rates, the mass splitting between the heavier state and the dark
matter must be comparable to, or smaller than, the kinetic energy of particles
in the plasma. As a result, the predicted photon line falls in the soft X-ray
range, or, potentially, at arbitrarily lower energies. We explore experimental
constraints from cosmology and particle physics, and present accurate
calculations of the dark matter thermal relic density and of the flux of
monochromatic X-rays from thermal plasma excitation. We find that the model

of the line from dwarf galaxies. The unique line shape, which will be resolved
by future observations with the Hitomi (formerly Astro-H) satellite, and the

electron double quantum dot in GaAs. At finite magnetic fields, we observe two
characteristic tunneling times, T_d and T_b, belonging to, respectively, a
direct and a blocked (spin-flip-assisted) tunneling. The latter corresponds to
lifting of a Pauli spin blockade and the tunneling times ratio eta=T_b/T_d
characterizes the blockade efficiency. We find pronounced changes in the
behavior of eta upon increasing the magnetic field, with eta increasing,
saturating and increasing again. We explain this behavior as due to the
crossover of the dominant blockade lifting mechanism from the hyperfine to
spin-orbit interactions and due to a change in the contribution of the charge
decoherence.

yet they represent an ideal opportunity to learn more about the initial
conditions of high-mass star formation (HMSF), since high-mass starless cores
(HMSCs) lack the violent feedback seen at later evolutionary stages.
  We present continuum maps obtained from the Submillimeter Array (SMA)
interferometry at 1.1 mm for four infrared dark clouds (IRDCs, G28.34S, IRDC
18530, IRDC 18306, and IRDC 18308). We also present 1 mm/3 mm line surveys
using IRAM 30 m single-dish observations.
  Our results are: (1) At a spatial resolution of 10^4 AU, the 1.1 mm SMA
observations resolve each source into several fragments. The mass of each
fragment is on average >10 Msun, which exceeds the predicted thermal Jeans mass
of the whole clump by a factor of up to 30, indicating that thermal pressure
does not dominate the fragmentation process. Our measured velocity dispersions
in the 30 m lines imply that non-thermal motions provides the extra support
against gravity in the fragments. (2) Both non-detection of high-J transitions
and the hyperfine multiplet fit of N2H+(1-0), C2H(1-0), HCN(1-0), and
H13CN(1-0) indicate that our sources are cold and young. However, obvious
detection of SiO and the asymmetric line profile of HCO+(1-0) in G28.34S
indicate a potential protostellar object and probable infall motion. (3) With a
large number of N-bearing species, the existence of carbon rings and molecular
ions, and the anti-correlated spatial distributions between N2H+/NH2D and CO,
our large-scale high-mass clumps exhibit similar chemical features as
small-scale low-mass prestellar objects. This study of a small sample of IRDCs
illustrates that thermal Jeans instability alone cannot explain the
fragmentation of the clump into cold (~15 K), dense (>10^5 cm-3) cores and that
these IRDCs are not completely quiescent.

and its scatter at intermediate redshifts ($0.5\leq z\leq0.7$) for 1381 field
galaxies collected from deep spectroscopic surveys. The star formation rate
(SFR) and color at a given $M_{*}$ of this magnitude-limited ($R\lesssim24$ AB)
sample are representative of normal star-forming galaxies. For masses below
$10^9 M_\odot$, our sample of 237 galaxies is $\sim$10 times larger than those
in previous studies beyond the local universe. This huge gain in sample size
enables superior constraints on the MZR and its scatter in the low-mass regime.
We find a power-law MZR at $10^{8} M_\odot < M_{*} < 10^{11} M_\odot$:
${12+log(O/H) = (5.83\pm0.19) + (0.30\pm0.02)log(M_{*}/M_\odot)}$. Our MZR
shows good agreement with others measured at similar redshifts in the
literature in the intermediate and massive regimes, but is shallower than the
extrapolation of the MZRs of others to masses below $10^{9} M_\odot$. The SFR
dependence of the MZR in our sample is weaker than that found for local
galaxies (known as the Fundamental Metallicity Relation). Compared to a variety
of theoretical models, the slope of our MZR for low-mass galaxies agrees well
with predictions incorporating supernova energy-driven winds. Being robust
against currently uncertain metallicity calibrations, the scatter of the MZR
serves as a powerful diagnostic of the stochastic history of gas accretion, gas
recycling, and star formation of low-mass galaxies. Our major result is that
the scatter of our MZR increases as $M_{*}$ decreases. Our result implies that
either the scatter of the baryonic accretion rate or the scatter of the
$M_{*}$--$M_{halo}$ relation increases as $M_{*}$ decreases. Moreover, our
measures of scatter at $z=0.7$ appears consistent with that found for local
galaxies.

inertial to physical mass ratio, which is related to the frequency of
oscillations in a trapped gas, is found to be unity in the limits of strong and
weak attraction and falls to $\approx 0.78$ in the crossover regime. This
result is contrasted by one-dimensional mean field theory, which predicts a
divergent mass ratio in the weakly attractive limit. By means of an exact

effectively hydrogen-free spectra dominated by relatively narrow helium P-Cygni
spectral features and it was classified as a SN Ibn. In this paper we present
photometric, spectroscopic, and spectropolarimetric observations of SN 2015U,
including a Keck/DEIMOS spectrum (resolution $\approx$ 5000) which fully
resolves the optical emission and absorption features. We find that SN 2015U is
best understood via models of shock breakout from extended and dense
circumstellar material (CSM), likely created by a history of mass loss from the
progenitor with an extreme outburst within $\sim$1-2 yr of core collapse (but
we do not detect any outburst in our archival imaging of NGC 2388). We argue
that the high luminosity of SN 2015U was powered not through $^{56}$Ni decay
but via the deposition of kinetic energy into the ejecta/CSM shock interface.
Though our analysis is hampered by strong host-galaxy dust obscuration (which
likely exhibits multiple components), our dataset makes SN 2015U one of the
best-studied Type Ibn supernovae and provides a bridge of understanding to
other rapidly fading transients, both luminous and relatively faint.

illustrates the potential of vast spectroscopic surveys with high filling

$G$ self-similar, i.e. when can $G$ be faithfully represented as a self-similar
group of automorphisms of the $p$-adic tree? We show that, if $G$ is a
self-similar finite $p$-group of rank $r$, then its order is bounded by a
function of $p$ and $r$. This applies in particular to finite $p$-groups of a
given coclass. In the particular case of groups of maximal class, that is, of
coclass $1$, we can fully answer the question above: a $p$-group of maximal
class $G$ is self-similar if and only if it contains an elementary abelian
maximal subgroup over which $G$ splits. Furthermore, in that case the order of
$G$ is at most $p^p+1$, and this bound is sharp.

burst, FRB150418, with a promising radio counterpart at 5.5 and 7.5 GHz -- a
rapidly decaying source, falling from 200-300 $\mu$Jy to 100 $\mu$Jy on
timescales of $\sim$6 d. This transient source may be associated with an
elliptical galaxy at redshift $z=0.492$, providing the first firm spectroscopic
redshift for a FRB and the ability to estimate the density of baryons in the
intergalactic medium via the combination of known redshift and radio dispersion
of the FRB. An alternative explanation, first suggested by Williams & Berger
(2016b), is that the identified counterpart may instead be a compact AGN. The
putative counterpart's variation may then instead be extrinsic, caused by
refractive scintillation in the ionized interstellar medium of the Milky Way,
which would invalidate the association with FRB150418. We examine this latter
explanation in detail and show that the reported observations are consistent
with scintillating radio emission from the core of a radio-loud active galactic
nucleus (AGN) having a brightness temperature $T_{\rm b} \gtrsim 10^9 {\rm K}$.
Using numerical simulations of the expected scattering for the line of sight to
FRB150418, we provide example images and light curves of such an AGN at 5.5 and
7.5 GHz. These results can be compared with continued radio monitoring to
conclusively determine the importance of scintillation for the observed radio
variability, and they show that scintillation is a critical consideration for
continued searches for FRB counterparts at radio wavelengths.

collective dynamics of large populations single-compartment (point) model
neurons have been proven very successful. These models, however, lack the
dendritic morphology to biophysically account for the effects of electric
fields, and for changes in synaptic integration due to morphology alone. Here
we (i) characterize the response of a canonical spatial (ball-and-stick) model
neuron to fluctuating synaptic input as well as an oscillatory, weak electric
field, and (ii) analytically derive an extension for popular integrate-and-fire
point neuron models to accurately reproduce these responses. We obtain distinct
filters mediated by the dendrite for inputs at the soma (high-pass filter) or
at the distal dendritic site (low-pass filter), and find that the electric
field induces spike rate resonance in the beta and gamma frequency bands or
even higher frequencies, depending on the location of synaptic background
input. Due to their computational efficiency the extended point models are well
suited for application in large populations of coupled neurons with different
morphology, exposed to extracellular electric fields.

the cold dark matter paradigm, the characteristic feature being a suppression
of structure formation on small cosmological scales. A very similar situation
occurs if standard cold dark matter particles are kept in local thermal
equilibrium with a, possibly dark, relativistic species until the universe has
cooled down to keV temperatures. We perform a systematic phenomenological study
of this possibility, and classify all minimal models containing dark matter and
an arbitrary radiation component that allow such a late kinetic decoupling. We
recover explicit cases recently discussed in the literature and identify new
classes of examples that are very interesting from a model-building point of
view. In some of these models dark matter is inevitably self-interacting, which
is remarkable in view of recent observational support for this possibility.
Hence, dark matter models featuring late kinetic decoupling have the potential
not only to alleviate the missing satellites problem but also to address other
problems of the cosmological concordance model on small scales, in particular
the cusp-core and too-big-too-fail problems, in some cases without invoking any
additional input.

polarization study of the ""Snail"" PWN inside the supernova remnant G327.1-1.1

recently crushed by the supernova (SN) reverse shock. The radio morphology is
composed of a main circular body with a finger-like protrusion. We detected a
strong linear polarization signal from the emission, which reflects a highly
ordered magnetic field in the PWN and is in contrast to the turbulent
environment with a tangled magnetic field generally expected from
hydrodynamical simulations. This could suggest that the characteristic
turbulence scale is larger than the radio beam size. We built a toy model to
explore this possibility, and found that a simulated PWN with a turbulence
scale of about one-eighth to one-sixth of the nebula radius and a pulsar wind
filling factor of 50--75% provides the best match to observations. This implies
substantial mixing between the SN ejecta and pulsar wind material in this
system.

where the evolution is locked to a small subspace (quantum Zeno dynamics), or

measurement can effectively compete with standard unitary dynamics leading to
nontrivial effects. Here we consider global weak measurement addressing

which path information. While for certainty we focus on ultracold atoms, the
idea can be generalized to other multimode quantum systems, including various
quantum emitters, optomechanical arrays, and purely photonic systems with
multiple-path interferometers (photonic circuits). We show that light
scattering from ultracold bosons in optical lattices can be used for defining
macroscopically occupied spatial modes that exhibit long-range coherent
dynamics. Even if the measurement strength remains constant, the quantum
measurement backaction acts on the atomic ensemble quasi-periodically and
induces collective oscillatory dynamics of all the atoms. We introduce an
effective model for the evolution of the spatial modes and present an analytic
solution showing that the quantum jumps drive the system away from its stable
point. We confirm our finding describing the atomic observables in terms of
stochastic differential equations.

Vetta, in which users are grouped together. Our aim is to establish how
grouping and cooperation among users affect performance bounds. We consider two
types of grouping. The first type is from \cite{Zhang2014}, where each user
belongs to a group of users having social ties with it. For this type of
utility system, each user's strategy maximizes its social group utility
function, giving rise to the notion of \emph{social-aware Nash equilibrium}. We
prove that this social utility system yields to the bounding results of Vetta
for non-cooperative system, thus establishing provable performance guarantees
for the social-aware Nash equilibrium. For the second type of grouping, the set
of users is partitioned into $l$ disjoint groups, where the users within a
group cooperate to maximize their group utility function, giving rise to the
notion of \emph{group Nash equilibrium}. In this case, each group can be viewed
as a new user with vector-valued actions, and a 1/2 bound for the performance
of group Nash equilibrium follows from the result of Vetta. But as we show
tighter bounds involving curvature can be established. By defining the group
curvature $c_{k_i}$ associated with group $i$ with $k_i$ users, we show that if
the social utility function is nondecreasing and submodular, then any group
Nash equilibrium achieves at least $1/(1+\max_{1\leq i\leq l}c_{k_i})$ of the
optimal social utility, which is tighter than that for the case without
grouping. As a special case, if each user has the same action space, then we
have that any group Nash equilibrium achieves at least $1/(1+c_{k^*})$ of the
optimal social utility, where $k^*$ is the least number of users among the $l$
groups. Finally, we present an example of a utility system for database
assisted spectrum access to illustrate our results.

4227 A absorption extending out to +12,400 km/s, along with weak Fe I 3720 A

show a layered structure with a well defined Ca-rich outer edge indicative of a
delayed detonation phase. The remnant's clumpy inner Ca-rich shell plus only a
handful of Fe-rich plumes is unlike morphologies expected from dynamical or
violent merger scenarios. The small number of Fe-rich plumes suggest their
formation during a deflagration phase by Rayleigh-Taylor instabilities but less
well developed without extended mixing as expected from hydrodynamic
calculations. The suppression of strong Rayleigh-Taylor instabilities is
possibly the result of strong magnetic fields. We propose SN 1885 was an
off-center, delayed detonation and slightly subluminous SN Ia similar to SN

introduce a method of constructing, for each n, an i.i.d family, R*_(n,1), ...
R*_(n,n) which sums to S*_n, pointwise, as a function, not just in
distribution. Each R*_(n,i) is a mean 0, variance 1 Rademacher random variable
depending only on the first n bits. For each n, we get a bijection between the
set of all such i.i.d. families, R*_(n,1), ... R*_(n,n), and the set of all
admissible permutations of {0, ..., (2^n)-1}.
  Varying n, any doubly indexed such family, gives a triangular array
representation of the sequence {S*_n} which is strong (because for each n, S*_n
is the pointwise sum of the R*_(n,i)). Such representations are classified by
sequences of admissible permutations. We show that the complexity of any
sequence of admissible permutations is bounded below by that of 2^n. We
explicitly construct three such polynomial time computable sequences whose
complexity is bounded above by that of the function SBC (sum of binomial
coefficients). We also initiate the study of some additional fine properties of
admissible permutations.

structures through large-scale magnetic coupling. We build a realistic
environment of the solar corona on 2011 February 15 using a global
magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) model and initiate coronal mass ejections (CMEs) in
active region (AR) 11158 by inserting Gibson-Low analytical flux ropes. We show
that a CME's impact on the surrounding structures depends not only on the
magnetic strength of these structures and their distance to the source region,
but also on the interaction between the CME with the large-scale magnetic
field. Within the CME expansion domain where the flux rope field directly
interacts with the solar structures, expansion-induced reconnection often
modifies the overlying field, thereby increasing the decay index. This effect
may provide a primary coupling mechanism underlying the sympathetic eruptions.
The magnitude of the impact is found to depend on the orientation of the
erupting flux rope, with the largest impacts occurring when the flux rope is
favorably oriented for reconnecting with the surrounding regions. Outside the
CME expansion domain, the influence of the CME is mainly through field line
compression or post-eruption relaxation. Based on our numerical experiments, we
discuss a way to quantify the eruption impact, which could be useful for

inferring the behavior of natural or artificial systems. Turing Learning
simultaneously optimizes two populations of computer programs, one representing
models of the behavior of the system under investigation, and the other
representing classifiers. By observing the behavior of the system as well as
the behaviors produced by the models, two sets of data samples are obtained.
The classifiers are rewarded for discriminating between these two sets, that
is, for correctly categorizing data samples as either genuine or counterfeit.
Conversely, the models are rewarded for 'tricking' the classifiers into
categorizing their data samples as genuine. Unlike other methods for system
identification, Turing Learning does not require predefined metrics to quantify
the difference between the system and its models. We present two case studies
with swarms of simulated robots and prove that the underlying behaviors cannot
be inferred by a metric-based system identification method. By contrast, Turing
Learning infers the behaviors with high accuracy. It also produces a useful
by-product - the classifiers - that can be used to detect abnormal behavior in
the swarm. Moreover, we show that Turing Learning also successfully infers the
behavior of physical robot swarms. The results show that collective behaviors
can be directly inferred from motion trajectories of individuals in the swarm,
which may have significant implications for the study of animal collectives.
Furthermore, Turing Learning could prove useful whenever a behavior is not
easily characterizable using metrics, making it suitable for a wide range of
applications.

if the backstepping transformation is adequately posed. The resulting bilateral

safety-critical applications. In this paper, we consider an approach that
learns the ROA from experiments on a real system, without ever leaving the true
ROA and, thus, without risking safety-critical failures. Based on regularity
assumptions on the model errors in terms of a Gaussian process prior, we use an
underlying Lyapunov function in order to determine a region in which an
equilibrium point is asymptotically stable with high probability. Moreover, we
provide an algorithm to actively and safely explore the state space in order to
expand the ROA estimate. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this method in
simulation.

finding accurate clusters in a given dataset. However, their application to
large-scale datasets has been hindered by computational complexity of
eigenvalue decompositions. Several algorithms have been proposed in the recent
past to accelerate spectral clustering, however they compromise on the accuracy
of the spectral clustering to achieve faster speed. In this paper, we propose a
novel spectral clustering algorithm based on a mixing process on a graph.
Unlike the existing spectral clustering algorithms, our algorithm does not
require computing eigenvectors. Specifically, it finds the equivalent of a
linear combination of eigenvectors of the normalized similarity matrix weighted
with corresponding eigenvalues. This linear combination is then used to
partition the dataset into meaningful clusters. Simulations on real datasets
show that partitioning datasets based on such linear combinations of
eigenvectors achieves better accuracy than standard spectral clustering methods
as the number of clusters increase. Our algorithm can easily be implemented in

been statistically detected using data from the Infrared Astronomical Satellite
(IRAS), it has not been possible to sample the spectral energy distribution
(SED) of this emission over its peak, and thus to break the degeneracy between
dust temperature and mass. By complementing the IRAS spectral coverage with
Planck satellite data from 100 to 857 GHz, we provide new constraints on the IR
spectrum of thermal dust emission in clusters of galaxies. We achieve this by
using a stacking approach for a sample of several hundred objects from the
Planck cluster sample; this procedure averages out fluctuations from the IR
sky, allowing us to reach a significant detection of the faint cluster
contribution. We also use the large frequency range probed by Planck, together
with component-separation techniques, to remove the contamination from both
cosmic microwave background anisotropies and the thermal Sunyaev-Zeldovich
effect (tSZ) signal, which dominate below 353 GHz. By excluding dominant
spurious signals or systematic effects, averaged detections are reported at
frequencies between 353 and 5000 GHz. We confirm the presence of dust in
clusters of galaxies at low and intermediate redshifts, yielding an SED with a
shape similar to that of the Milky Way. Planck's beam does not allow us to
investigate the detailed spatial distribution of this emission (e.g., whether
it comes from intergalactic dust or simply the dust content of the cluster
galaxies), but the radial distribution of the emission appears to follow that
of the stacked SZ signal, and thus the extent of the clusters. The recovered
SED allows us to constrain the dust mass responsible for the signal, as well as
its temperature. We additionally explore the evolution of the IR emission as a
function of cluster mass and redshift.

it lacks effective quantities. The two models use different temporal and
spatial scales and effective parameter values for the macro model are computed
on the fly, allowing for improved efficiency over traditional one-scale
schemes.
  For the analysis, we consider a single spin under a high frequency field and
show that effective quantities can be obtained accurately with step-sizes much
larger than the size of the microscopic scales required to resolve the
microscopic features. Numerical results both for a single magnetic particle as
well as a chain of interacting magnetic particles are given to validate the

our network aligns the observed scene with a predefined 3D scene template, and
then reasons about the existence and location of each object within the scene
template. In doing so, our model recognizes multiple objects in a single
forward pass of a 3D convolutional neural network, capturing both global scene
and local object information simultaneously. To create training data for this
3D network, we generate partly hallucinated depth images which are rendered by
replacing real objects with a repository of CAD models of the same object
category. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our algorithm

only excites one electron, which sets the standard limit of power-conversion
efficiency, such as the Shockley-Queisser limit. In principle, generating and
harnessing multiple carriers per absorbed photon can improve the efficiency and
possibly overcome this limit. Here, we report the observation of multiple hot
carrier collection in graphene-boron-nitride Moire superlattice structures. A
record-high zero-bias photoresponsivity of 0.3 ampere per watt, equivalently,
an external quantum efficiency exceeding 50 percent, is achieved utilizing
graphene photo-Nernst effect, which demonstrates a collection of at least 5
carriers per absorbed photon. We reveal that this effect arises from the
enhanced Nernst coefficient through Lifshtiz transition at low energy Van Hove
singularities, which is an emergent phenomenon due to the formation of Moire
minibands. Our observation points to a new means for extremely efficient and
flexible optoelectronics based on van der Waals heterostructures.

finding their way into scholarly communication and, under the umbrella term
altmetrics, were introduced to research evaluation. Fueled by technological
possibilities and an increasing demand to demonstrate impact beyond the
scientific community, altmetrics received great attention as potential
democratizers of the scientific reward system and indicators of societal
impact. This paper focuses on current challenges of altmetrics. Heterogeneity,
data quality and particular dependencies are identified as the three major
issues and discussed in detail with a particular emphasis on past developments
in bibliometrics. The heterogeneity of altmetrics mirrors the diversity of the
types of underlying acts, most of which take place on social media platforms.
This heterogeneity has made it difficult to establish a common definition or
conceptual framework. Data quality issues become apparent in the lack of
accuracy, consistency and replicability of various altmetrics, which is largely
affected by the dynamic nature of social media events. It is further
highlighted that altmetrics are shaped by technical possibilities and depend
particularly on the availability of APIs and DOIs, are strongly dependent on
data providers and aggregators, and potentially influenced by technical
affordances of underlying platforms.

bags are required to learn a prediction function. However, a high human cost is
needed to know the label of each bag---positive or negative. Only positive bags
contain our focus (positive instances) while negative bags consist of noise or
background (negative instances). So we do not expect to spend too much to label
the negative bags. Contrary to our expectation, nearly all existing MIL methods
require enough negative bags besides positive ones. In this paper we propose an
algorithm called ""Positive Multiple Instance"" (PMI), which learns a classifier
given only a set of positive bags. So the annotation of negative bags becomes
unnecessary in our method. PMI is constructed based on the assumption that the
unknown positive instances in positive bags be similar each other and
constitute one compact cluster in feature space and the negative instances
locate outside this cluster. The experimental results demonstrate that PMI
achieves the performances close to or a little worse than those of the
traditional MIL algorithms on benchmark and real data sets. However, the number
of training bags in PMI is reduced significantly compared with traditional MIL
algorithms.

oscillators. Conditions are given for which there exists a direct coupling
observer which estimates a collection of variables in the quantum plant. It is
shown that the order of the observer can be the same as the number of variables
to be estimated when this number is even and thus this is a reduced order
observer.

  the 19th International Symposium on Mathematical Theory of Networks and
  Systems, 2010",,,,"quant-ph cs.SY math.OC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  This paper surveys some recent results on the theory of quantum linear
systems and presents them within a unified framework. Quantum linear systems
are a class of systems whose dynamics, which are described by the laws of
quantum mechanics, take the specific form of a set of linear quantum stochastic
differential equations (QSDEs). Such systems commonly arise in the area of
quantum optics and related disciplines. Systems whose dynamics can be described
or approximated by linear QSDEs include interconnections of optical cavities,
beam-spitters, phase-shifters, optical parametric amplifiers, optical
squeezers, and cavity quantum electrodynamic systems. With advances in quantum
technology, the feedback control of such quantum systems is generating new
challenges in the field of control theory. Potential applications of such
quantum feedback control systems include quantum computing, quantum error
correction, quantum communications, gravity wave detection, metrology, atom
lasers, and superconducting quantum circuits.
  A recently emerging approach to the feedback control of quantum linear
systems involves the use of a controller which itself is a quantum linear
system. This approach to quantum feedback control, referred to as coherent
quantum feedback control, has the advantage that it does not destroy quantum
information, is fast, and has the potential for efficient implementation. This
paper discusses recent results concerning the synthesis of H-infinity optimal
controllers for linear quantum systems in the coherent control case. An
important issue which arises both in the modelling of linear quantum systems
and in the synthesis of linear coherent quantum controllers is the issue of
physical realizability. This issue relates to the property of whether a given
set of QSDEs corresponds to a physical quantum system satisfying the laws of
quantum mechanics.

we report a data-driven simulation of the well-observed X1.0 flare on 2014
March 29 that can reconcile some well-known spectral discrepancies. We analyzed
spectra of the flaring region from the Interface Region Imaging Spectrograph
(IRIS) in MgII h&k, the Interferometric BIdimensional Spectropolarimeter at the
Dunn Solar Telescope (DST/IBIS) in H$\alpha$ 6563 \AA\ and CaII 8542 \AA, and
the Reuven Ramaty High Energy Solar Spectroscope Imager (RHESSI) in hard
X-rays. We constructed a multi-threaded flare loop model and used the electron
flux inferred from RHESSI data as the input to the radiative hydrodynamic code
RADYN to simulate the atmospheric response. We then synthesized various
chromospheric emission lines and compared them with the IRIS and IBIS
observations. In general, the synthetic intensities agree with the observed
ones, especially near the northern footpoint of the flare. The simulated MgII
line profile has narrower wings than the observed one. This discrepancy can be
reduced by using a higher microturbulent velocity (27 km/s) in a narrow
chromospheric layer. In addition, we found that an increase of electron density
in the upper chromosphere within a narrow height range of $\approx$800 km below
the transition region can turn the simulated MgII line core into emission and
thus reproduce the single peaked profile, which is a common feature in all IRIS
flares.

assuming that they are ranked by level of expertise, and use typical
Information Retrieval (IR) measures to evaluate their effectiveness. However,
we figured out that expert rankings (i) tend to be partially ordered, (ii)
incomplete, and (iii) consequently provide more an order rather than absolute
ranks, which is not what usual IR measures exploit. To improve this state of
the art, we propose to revise the formalism used in IR to design proper
measures for comparing expert rankings. In this report, we investigate a first
step by providing mitigation procedures for the three issues, and we analyse IR
measures with the help of these procedures to identify interesting revisions
and remaining limitations. From this analysis, we see that most of the measures
can be exploited for this more generic context because of our mitigation
procedures. Moreover, measures based on precision and recall, usually unable to
consider the order of the ranked items, are of first interest if we represent a
ranking as a set of ordered pairs. Cumulative measures, on the other hand, are
specifically designed for considering the order but suffer from a higher
complexity, motivating the use of precision/recall measures with the right

The objective is to minimize the accumulation of losses over the time horizon,

loss functions, we consider strongly convex functions so as to provide better
guarantees of performance. We derive a regret bound that captures the
path-length of the time-varying parameter, defined in terms of the distance

natural connection of tracking quality to the rate of change of the parameter.

adjusting the energy-splitting of the driven two-level atomic scatters (i.e.,
atomic mirrors). As a consequence, the photon can be controllably
transmitted/reflected along the waveguide by the aside atomic mirrors with the
adjustable atomic energy levels. Ideally, the photons could be stopped in the

this paper, we propose an integrated spectrum and information market for a
database-assisted TV white space network, where the geo-location database
serves as both the spectrum market platform and the information market
platform. We study the interactions among the database, the spectrum licensee,
and unlicensed users by modelling the system as a three-stage sequential
decision process. In Stage I, the database and the licensee negotiate regarding
the commission for the licensee to use the spectrum market platform. In Stage
II, the database and the licensee compete for selling information or channels
to unlicensed users. In Stage III, unlicensed users determine whether they
should buy exclusive usage right of licensed channels from the licensee or
information regarding unlicensed channels from the database. Analyzing such a
three-stage model is challenging due to the co-existence of both positive and
negative network externalities in the information market. Despite of this, we
are able to characterize how the network externalities affect the equilibrium
behaviors of all parties involved. We analytically show that in this integrated
market, the licensee can never get a market share more than half. Our numerical
results further show that the proposed integrated market can improve the
network profit up to 87%, compared with a pure information market.

particles to form physical particles. The virtual particles affect properties
such as the mass and charge of the physical particles, and it is only these
modified properties that can be measured in experiments, not the properties of
the bare particles. The influence of virtual particles is prominent in the
ultrastrong-coupling regime of cavity quantum electrodynamics (QED), which has
recently been realized in several condensed-matter systems. In some of these
systems, the effective interaction between atom-like transitions and the cavity
photons can be switched on or off by external control pulses. This offers
unprecedented possibilities for exploring quantum vacuum fluctuations and the
relation between physical and bare particles. Here we show that, by applying
external electromagnetic pulses of suitable amplitude and frequency, each
virtual photon dressing a physical excitation in cavity-QED systems can be
converted into a physical observable photon, and back again. In this way, the
hidden relationship between the bare and the physical excitations becomes
experimentally testable. The conversion between virtual and physical photons
can be clearly pictured using Feynman diagrams with cut loops.

Redshift Survey and 1 Jy ultraluminous infrared galaxies sample with the Sloan
Digital Sky Survey Data Release 7 database. The investigation is done by
comparing our sample to a control sample matched in the normalized redshift
distribution in two diagnostics, which are the nuclear gas-phase metallicity
vs. stellar mass and the nuclear SFR vs. stellar mass diagrams. Galaxies with
different morphological types show different mass-metallicity relations (MZR).
Compared to the MZR defined by the control sample, isolated spirals have
comparable metallicities with the control sample at a given stellar mass.
Spirals in pairs and interacting galaxies with projected separations $r_{p} >$
20 kpc show mild metallicity dilution of 0.02-0.03 dex. Interacting galaxies
with $r_{p} <$ 20 kpc, pre-mergers and advanced mergers are under-abundant by
~0.06, ~0.05 and ~0.04 dex, respectively. This shows an evolutionary trend that
the metallicity is increasingly depressed as the merging proceeds and it is
diluted most dramatically when two galaxies are closely interacting.
Afterwards, the interstellar medium (ISM) is enriched when the galaxies
coalesce. This is the first time that such ISM enrichment at the final
coalescence stage is observed, which demonstrates the importance of supernova
explosion in affecting the nuclear metallicity. Meanwhile the central SFR
enhancement relative to the control sample evolves simultaneously with the
nuclear gas-phase oxygen abundance. Our results support the predictions from
numerical simulations.

the depth map for the source image. To do so, we explicitly generate an inverse
warp of the target image using the predicted depth and known inter-view
displacement, to reconstruct the source image; the photomet- ric error in the

this training data is considerably simpler than for equivalent systems,
requiring no manual annotation, nor calibration of depth sensor to camera. We

are derived from precision low-energy observables such as electric dipole
moments, (g-2) of charged leptons, atomic parity violation, neutral meson
mixing, Kaon, B, and D meson decays, etc. We provide a general analysis of
indirect constraints on the strength of LQ interactions with the quarks and

scaling is reached on the local, smaller scale, leading to a cascading
explosive process, reminiscent of the flaring activity.

which the pulsar's spin-frequency and its first derivative have been subtracted
from the timing solution fitting. We first classify the timing residual
patterns into different types based on the sign of $\ddot\nu$. Then we use the
magnetic field oscillation model developed in our group \citep{zhang12a} to fit
successfully the different kinds of timing residuals with the Markov Chain
Monte Carlo method. Finally, we simulate the spin evolution over 20 years for a

we find that most of the observed residual patterns can be reproduced
successfully. This is the first time that the observed residual patterns are
fitted by a model and reproduced by simulations with very few parameters. From
the distribution of the different residual patterns in the $P-\dot P$ diagram,

notorious sign problem in MC simulations. This makes it prospective for dealing
with the non-zero chemical potential in QCD and other lattice gauge theories,
as well as with real-time simulations. In this paper, using matrix product
operators, we extend our analysis of the Schwinger model at zero temperature to
show the feasibility of this approach also at finite temperature. This is an
important step on the way to deal with the sign problem of QCD. We analyze in
detail the chiral symmetry breaking in the massless and massive cases and show
that the method works very well and gives good control over a broad range of

connection between the behaviour of persistence and the scaling of variance. In
particular, we find that for a two-state quantum walks persistence follows an
inverse power-law where the exponent is determined solely by the coin
parameter. Moreover, for a one-parameter family of three-state quantum walks
containing the Grover walk the scaling of persistence is given by two
contributions. The first is the inverse power-law. The second contribution to
the asymptotic behaviour of persistence is an exponential decay coming from the
trapping nature of the studied family of quantum walks. In contrast to the
two-state walks both the exponent of the inverse power-law and the decay
constant of the exponential decay depend also on the initial coin state and its
coherence. Hence, one can achieve various regimes of persistence by altering
the initial condition, ranging from purely exponential decay to purely inverse
power-law behaviour.

rich physics and concepts, from composite fermions in two-dimensional electron

electrons in graphene and magnetic monopoles in spin ice. Even more surprising
is the fragmentation of the degrees of freedom themselves, leading to

recently put forward in the context of spin ice, in which the magnetic moment
field can fragment, resulting in a dual ground state consisting of a
fluctuating spin liquid, a so-called Coulomb phase, on top of a magnetic
monopole crystal. Here we show, by means of neutron scattering measurements,
that such fragmentation occurs in the spin ice candidate Nd$_2$Zr$_2$O$_7$. We
observe the spectacular coexistence of an antiferromagnetic order induced by
the monopole crystallisation and a fluctuating state with ferromagnetic
correlations. Experimentally, this fragmentation manifests itself via the
superposition of magnetic Bragg peaks, characteristic of the ordered phase, and
a pinch point pattern, characteristic of the Coulomb phase. These results

the Carnot efficiency can be achieved at finite power. Most of the previous

for exploiting low rank structure in the parametric solution of an mp-QP
problem in order to reduce the required memory is introduced. The method is
based on ideas similar to what is done to exploit low rank modifications in
generic QP solvers, but is here applied to mp-QP problems to save memory. The
proposed method has been evaluated experimentally, and for some examples of
relevant problems the relative memory reduction is an order of magnitude
compared to storing the full parametric solution and critical regions.

any obvious way the well-known symmetry property
$c_{\mu\nu}^\lambda=c_{\nu\mu}^\lambda$. Here we introduce two maps,
$\rho^{(n)}$ on LR tableaux and $\sigma^{(n)}$ on LR hives, that each
interchange contributions to $c_{\mu\nu}^\lambda$ and $c_{\nu\mu}^\lambda$ for
any partitions $\lambda$, $\mu$, $\nu$ of lengths no greater than $n$, and then
prove not only that each of them is a bijection, thereby making manifest the
required symmetry property, but also that both maps are involutions. The map
$\rho^{(n)}$ involves the iterative action of deletion operators on a given LR
tableau of skew shape $\lambda/\mu$ and weight $\nu$, that produce a sequence
of successively smaller tableaux whose consecutive inner shapes define a
certain Gelfand-Tsetlin pattern and determine a partner LR tableau of skew
shape $\lambda/\nu$ and weight $\mu$. Similarly, the map $\sigma^{(n)}$
involves repeated path removals from a given LR hive with boundary edge labels
$(\lambda,\mu,\nu)$ that give rise to a sequence of hives whose left-hand
boundary edge labels define the same Gelfand-Tsetlin pattern as before, which
is sufficient to determine a partner LR hive with boundary edge labels
$(\lambda,\nu,\mu)$. The deletions in tableaux are organised so as to preserve
the semistandard and lattice permutation properties of LR tableaux, while the
path removals in hives are designed to preserve both the triangle condition on
edge labels and the hive rhombus gradient positivity conditions. At all stages
illustrative examples are provided.

Survey (DES) Science Verification (SV) data, using weak gravitational lensing
measurements from a 139 deg$^2$ field. We measure the abundance of peaks
identified in aperture mass maps, as a function of their signal-to-noise ratio,
in the signal-to-noise range $0<\mathcal S / \mathcal N<4$. To predict the peak
counts as a function of cosmological parameters we use a suite of $N$-body
simulations spanning 158 models with varying $\Omega_{\rm m}$ and $\sigma_8$,
fixing $w = -1$, $\Omega_{\rm b} = 0.04$, $h = 0.7$ and $n_s=1$, to which we
have applied the DES SV mask and redshift distribution. In our fiducial
analysis we measure $\sigma_{8}(\Omega_{\rm m}/0.3)^{0.6}=0.77 \pm 0.07$, after
marginalising over the shear multiplicative bias and the error on the mean
redshift of the galaxy sample. We introduce models of intrinsic alignments,
blending, and source contamination by cluster members. These models indicate
that peaks with $\mathcal S / \mathcal N>4$ would require significant
corrections, which is why we do not include them in our analysis. We compare
our results to the cosmological constraints from the two point analysis on the
SV field and find them to be in good agreement in both the central value and
its uncertainty. We discuss prospects for future peak statistics analysis with
upcoming DES data.

calculations were performed for Fe, Co, and Ni adatoms and monolayers on

Ca3Co2O6, undergoing geometrically frustrated antiferromagnetic ordering below
25 K, has been investigated as a function of temperature and magnetic field (H)
and compared with magnetization (M) behavior. The results provide evidence for
anisotropic magnetodielectric (MDE) coupling in this compound. Ac
susceptibility exhibits a strong frequency dependence for H parallel c with
changes of this feature with the application of external dc magnetic field. No
feature in ac susceptibility could be observed for H perpendicular c, thereby
providing evidence for strong anisotropic spin-glass behavior. Interestingly,
the strong frequency dependence in dielectric is present for both the
crystallographic directions (E parallel c and E perpendicular c where E is the
electric field) with a negligible influence of H, despite the existence of MDE
coupling. This result appears to suggest different dynamics of electric dipole
and spin-glass, although they are coupled with each other. In addition,
interestingly, there is also a step at one-third of high-(magnetic) field value
of MDE at some temperatures tracking a similar step in M(H). This work also
confirms following unusual features reported on polycrystals, when measured
along c-axis. The dielectric constant exhibits a broad peak around 50-130 K
when the electric field is applied along the spin-chain (crystallographic c
direction); however this feature is essentially absent for the perpendicular
orientation. This finding supports the role of incipient spin-chain ordering to
induce magnetodielectric coupling. There is a signature of magnetoelectric
phase coexistence when the magnetic field is applied along the spin-chain
irrespective of the direction of applied electric field.

computation. However, its performance is limited by the adiabatic theorem of
quantum mechanics. In this scenario, shortcuts to adiabaticity, such as
provided by the superadiabatic theory, constitute a valuable tool to speed up
the adiabatic quantum behavior. In this dissertation we introduce two different
models to perform universal superadiabatic quantum computing, which are based
on the use of shortcuts to adiabaticity by counter-diabatic Hamiltonians. The
first model is based on the use of superadiabatic quantum teleportation,
introduced in this dissertation, as a primitive to quantum computing. Thus, we
provide the counter-diabatic driving for arbitrary $n$-qubit gates. In
addition, our approach maps the counter-diabatic Hamiltonian for an arbitrary
$n$-qubit {\it gate} teleportation into the implementation of a rotated
counter-diabatic Hamiltonian for an $n$-qubit {\it state} teleportation. In the
second model we use the concept of controlled superadiabatic evolutions to show
how we can implement arbitrary $n$-controlled quantum gates. Remarkably, this
task can be performed by simple time-independent counter-diabatic Hamiltonians.
These two models can be used to design different sets of universal quantum
gates. We show that the use of the quantum speed limit suggests that the
superadiabatic time evolution is compatible with arbitrarily small time
intervals, where this arbitrariness is constrained to the energetic cost
necessary to perform the superadiabatic evolution.

agents are considered to be fully stochastic processes and the system itself is
seen as a large stochastic process. From the standpoint of a particular agent -
having to choose a strategy, the choice of the paradigm is crucial: the most
adequate strategy depends on the assumptions made on the other agents.
  In this paper, we focus on two-player games and their application to the
automated synthesis of reliable controllers for reactive systems - a field at
the crossroads between computer science and mathematics. In this setting, the
reactive system to control is a player, and its environment is its opponent,
usually assumed to be fully antagonistic or fully stochastic. We illustrate
several recent developments aiming to breach this narrow taxonomy by providing
formal concepts and mathematical frameworks to reason about richer behavioral
models.
  The interest of such models is not limited to reactive system synthesis but
extends to other application fields of game theory. The goal of our
contribution is to give a high-level presentation of key concepts and
applications, aimed at a broad audience. To achieve this goal, we illustrate
those rich behavioral models on a classical challenge of the everyday life:

image plane geometry is captured implicitly by a large overlap of neighbouring

by means of a descriptor transition table, learnt from a single sequence for
each known gallery object. These allow us to connect local descriptors along
the 3rd dimension (which corresponds to viewpoint changes), thus resulting in a
set of variable length Markov chains for each video. The matching of two sets
of such chains is formulated as a statistical hypothesis test, whereby a subset
of each is chosen to maximize the likelihood that the corresponding video

it as the maximum weighted $\ell_1$ norm over the solution set of a linear
complementarity problem (LCP). The minimum $\ell_1$ norm of solutions of this
LCP is a lower bound on the independent domination number of the graph. Unlike
the case of the maximum $\ell_1$ norm, this lower bound is in general weak, but
we show it to be tight if the graph is a forest. Using methods from the theory
of LCPs, we obtain a few graph theoretic results. In particular, we provide a
stronger variant of the Lov\'{a}sz theta of a graph. We then provide sufficient
conditions for a graph to be well-covered, i.e., for all maximal independent
sets to also be maximum. This condition is also shown to be necessary for
well-coveredness if the graph is a forest. Finally, the reduction of the
maximum independent set problem to a linear program with (linear)
complementarity constraints (LPCC) shows that LPCCs are hard to approximate.

is more promising for SH0 wave excitation but this mode cannot appear in
conventional piezoelectric ceramics. Recently, by modifying the symmetry of
poled PbZr1-xTixO3 (PZT) ceramics via ferroelastic domain engineering, we
realized the face-shear d36 mode in both soft and hard PZT ceramics. In this
work, we further improved the face-shear properties of PZT-4 and PZT-5H
ceramics via lateral compression under elevated temperature. It was found that
when bonded on a 1 mm-thick aluminum plate, the d36 type PZT-4 exhibited better
face-shear performance than PZT-5H. We then successfully excite SH0 wave in the
aluminum plate using a face-shear PZT-4 square patch and receive the wave using
a face-shear PMN-PT patch. The frequency response and directionality of the
excited SH0 wave were also investigated. The SH0 wave can be dominate over the
Lamb waves (S0 and A0 waves) from 160 kHz to 280 kHz. The wave amplitude
reaches its maxima along the two main directions (0{\deg} and 90{\deg}). The
amplitude can keep over 80% of the maxima when the deviate angle is less than
30{\deg}, while it vanishes quickly at the 45{\deg} direction. The excited SH0

uniaxial tensile stretching at constant imposed Hencky strain rate
$\dot\varepsilon$, by means of linear stability analysis and nonlinear (slender
filament) simulations. We demonstrate necking to be an intrinsic flow
instability that arises as an inevitable consequence of the constitutive
behaviour of essentially any material (with a possible rare exception, which we
outline). We derive criteria for the onset of necking that are reportable
simply in terms of characteristic signatures in the shapes of the
experimentally measured rheological response functions, and should therefore
apply universally to all materials. As evidence of their generality, we
numerically show them to hold in six popular constitutive models of polymers
and soft glasses. Two distinct modes of necking instability are predicted. The
first is relatively gentle, and sets in when the tensile stress signal first
curves down as a function of the time $t$ (or accumulated strain
$\epsilon=\dot\varepsilon t$) since the inception of the flow. The second is
more violent, and sets in when a carefully defined `elastic derivative' of the
tensile force first slopes down as a function of $t$ (or $\dot\varepsilon$). In
the limit of fast flow $\dot\varepsilon\tau\to\infty$, where $\tau$ is the
material's characteristic stress relaxation time, this second mode reduces to
the Consid\'ere criterion for necking in solids. However we show that the
Consid\'ere criterion fails to correctly predict the onset of necking in any
viscoelastic regime of finite imposed $\dot\varepsilon\tau$. Finally, we
elucidate the way these modes of instability manifest themselves in entangled
linear polymers, wormlike micelles and branched polymers. We demonstrate four
distinct regimes as a function of imposed strain rate, consistent with
experimental master curves.

model and, in particular, determining the threshold of epidemic spread quite
challenging. It has been shown that the exact marginal probabilities of
infection can be upper bounded by an $n$-dimensional linear time-invariant
system, a consequence of which is that the Markov chain is ""fast-mixing"" when
the LTI system is stable, i.e. when
$\frac{\beta}{\delta}<\frac{1}{\lambda_{\max}(A)}$ (where $\beta$ is the
infection rate per link, $\delta$ is the recovery rate, and $\lambda_{\max}(A)$

that is formulated as a continuous-time, continuous-space stochastic optimal
control problem, by developing a topology-guided path integral control method.
The path integral control framework, which forms the backbone of the proposed
method, re-writes the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation as a statistical
inference problem; the resulting inference problem is solved by a sampling
procedure that computes the distribution of controlled trajectories around the
trajectory by the passive dynamics. For motion control of robots in a highly
cluttered environment, however, this sampling can easily be trapped in a local
minimum unless the sample size is very large, since the global optimality of
local minima depends on the degree of uncertainty. Thus, a homology-embedded
sampling-based planner that identifies many (potentially) local-minimum
trajectories in different homology classes is developed to aid the sampling
process. In combination with a receding-horizon fashion of the optimal control
the proposed method produces a dynamically feasible and collision-free motion
plans without being trapped in a local minimum. Numerical examples on a

indefinitely and a stationary phase where the mean record value remains bounded

$\delta_k$ is increasing. The problem is partly motivated by the dynamics of
evolutionary adaptation in biological fitness landscapes, where $\delta_k$

that a phase transition between two different BIQH phases is in a deconfined

bonding and anti-bonding states of the DQD at zero bias. In contrast to charge
qubits defined by the two localised ground states of the uncoupled DQD, this
choice of the basis causes the resulting dynamics to have a maximal overlap
with an idealised two-state model. Our optimal qubit basis states are not
localised to a single quantum dot and, as such, initialising the qubit requires
a particular sequence of gate pulses to take the system from an initial
fiducial state of the DQD to the logical $0$ or $1$. We determine this sequence
using pulses that incorporate the expected experimental finite rise times. We
also show how to perform arbitrary single qubit operations on the Bloch sphere
using spin-echo type pulsing, allowing us to obtain any qubit state with at

determining the probability of finding the electron in one of the dots.

GeV/$c^2$ mass range. We make use of a 582 kg-day fiducial exposure from an
array of 800 g Germanium bolometers equipped with a set of interleaved
electrodes with full surface coverage. We searched specifically for $\sim
2.5-20$ keV nuclear recoils inside the detector fiducial volume. As an
illustration the number of observed events in the search for 5 (resp. 20)
GeV/$c^2$ WIMPs are 9 (resp. 4), compared to an expected background of 6.1
(resp. 1.4). A 90% CL limit of $4.3\times 10^{-40}$ cm$^2$ (resp. $9.4\times
10^{-44}$ cm$^2$) is set on the spin-independent WIMP-nucleon scattering
cross-section for 5 (resp. 20) GeV/$c^2$ WIMPs. This result represents a
41-fold improvement with respect to the previous EDELWEISS-II low-mass WIMP
search for 7 GeV/$c^2$ WIMPs. The derived constraint is in tension with hints
of WIMP signals from some recent experiments, thus confirming results obtained
with different detection techniques.

absorption in excess of the Milky Way. The column densities of metals inferred
from UV and optical spectra differ from those derived from soft X-ray spectra,
at times by an order of magnitude, with the latter being higher. The origin of
the soft X-ray absorption excess observed in GRB X-ray afterglow spectra
remains a heavily debated issue, which has resulted in numerous investigations
on the effect of hot material both internal and external to the GRB host galaxy
on our X-ray afterglow observations. Nevertheless, all models proposed so far
have either only been able to account for a subset of our observations (i.e. at
z > 2), or they have required fairly extreme conditions to be present within
the absorbing material. In this paper, we investigate the absorption of the GRB
afterglow by a collisionally ionised and turbulent interstellar medium (ISM).
We find that a dense (3 per cubic centimeters) collisionally ionised ISM could
produce UV/optical and soft X-ray absorbing column densities that differ by a
factor of 10, however the UV/optical and soft X-ray absorbing column densities
for such sightlines and are 2-3 orders of magnitude lower in comparison to the
GRB afterglow spectra. For those GRBs with a larger soft X-ray excess of up to
an order of magnitude, the contribution in absorption from a turbulent ISM as
considered here would ease the required conditions of additional absorbing
components, such as the GRB circumburst medium and intergalactic medium.

observed an occasional resonant lock in the differential node $\Delta \Omega$
between two members in the Himalia irregular satellite group of Jupiter in the
$N$-body simulations (corresponding mass ratio $\sim 10^{-9}$). Using a
semianalytical approach, we have reproduced this phenomenon. We also
demonstrate the existence of two additional types of resonance, involving angle
differences $\Delta\omega$ and $\Delta (\Omega+\varpi)$ between two group
members. These resonances cause secular oscillations in eccentricity and/or
inclination on timescales $\sim$ 1 Myr. We locate these resonances in $(a,e,i)$

onto internal states of the single atom (quantum memory) we employ the
electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT) phenomenon (which can work out
as an optical transistor) where the information can be transferred to the dark
state of the atom modelled by a three-level system in a {\Lambda}-type
configuration. In our model we consider a suitable temporal shape for the
control field that ensures the adiabaticity of the storage process and
retrieval of the probe pulse. The dynamic of the field inside the cavity was
obtained by master equation approach, while the outside field was calculated by
input-output formalism. We have analysed two different setups: i) two-sided and
ii) single-sided cavities. While the first setup is the most appropriate and
commonly used to observe cavity-EIT in the transmission spectrum, thus the best
configuration for the optical transistor, the maximum quantum memory efficiency
can not reach reasonable values, being limited to 50% for symmetric cavities.
On the other hand, with single-sided cavity the quantum memory efficiency
increases considerably and can reach values close to 100% in the strong
atom-field coupling regime. However this specific setup is not favourable to
observe the cavity-EIT effect in the transmission spectrum and then it is not
appropriate to control the transmission of light pulses.

in uplink simultaneously. On the other hand, each wireless device is assumed to
be equipped with Radio-Frequency (RF) energy harvesting circuitry which gathers
the energy sent by AP and stores it in a finite capacity battery. The harvested
energy is then used for performing uplink data transmission tasks. In the
literature, the main focus so far has been on slot-oriented optimization. In
this context, all the harvested RF energy in a given slot is also consumed in
the same slot. However, this approach leads to sub-optimal solutions because it
does not take into account the Channel State Information (CSI) variations over
future slots. Differently from most of the prior works, in this paper we focus
on the long-term weighted throughput maximization problem. This approach
significantly increases the complexity of the optimization problem since it
requires to consider both CSI variations over future slots and the evolution of
the batteries when deciding the optimal resource allocation. We formulate the
problem using the Markov Decision Process (MDP) theory and show how to solve

strengths but at different thresholds. Indeed the energy difference is found
not to relax independently of its initial value above some critical interaction
strength which coincides with one of the thresholds. At the same point the

detected very-high energy (VHE) emission. In spite of this, the origin of the
VHE radiation from HESS J1640-465 has not been unambiguously clarified so far.
Indeed, a hadronic explanation cannot be ruled out by current observations. On

the latest total gamma-ray cross-section for proton-proton collisions available

revealed by the two-exciton states probed in two-dimensional spectra. Our first
main result is that the relation between the excitonic couplings and the
spectral shift in a two-dimensional structure is different (larger shift for
the same nearest neighbour coupling) from that in a one-dimensional structure,
which leads to an estimation of dipolar coupling in two-dimensional lattices.
We next investigate the mechanisms of homogeneous broadening - population
relaxation and pure dephasing - and evaluate their relative importance in
linear and two-dimensional aggregates. Our second main result is that pure
dephasing dominates the line width in two-dimensional systems up to a crossover
temperature, which explains the linear temperature dependence of the
homogeneous line width. This is directly related to the decreased density of
states at the band edge when compared with linear aggregates, thus reducing the
contribution of population relaxation to dephasing. Pump-probe experiments are
suggested to directly measure the lifetime of the bright state and can
therefore support the proposed model.

where the electron-hole recombination energy is transferred to an additional
carrier. It has been studied mostly in colloidal QDs, where the Auger
recombination time is in the ps range and efficiently quenches the light
emission. In self-assembled QDs, on the other hand, the influence of Auger
recombination on the optical properties is in general neglected, assuming that
it is masked by other processes such as spin and charge fluctuations. Here, we
use time-resolved resonance fluorescence to analyze the Auger recombination and
its influence on the optical properties of a single self-assembled QD. From
excitation-power dependent measurements, we find a long Auger recombination
time of about 500 ns and a quenching of the trion transition by about 80
percent. Furthermore, we observe a broadening of the trion transition linewidth
by up to a factor of two. With a model based on rate equations, we are able to
identify the interplay between tunneling and Auger rate as the underlying
mechanism for the reduced intensity and the broadening of the linewidth. This
demonstrates that self-assembled QDs can serve as an ideal model system to
study how the charge recapture process, given by the band-structure surrounding
the confined carriers, influences the Auger process. Our findings are not only
relevant for improving the emission properties of colloidal QD-based emitters

using a low-energy field theory approach, we study several issues discussed in
the system: the existence of local patterns in density and current,
chiral-current reversal, and the effect of a nearest-neighbor interaction along
the rung direction. In our formalism, the local patterns are interpreted as a
result of breaking of discrete symmetry. The chiral-current reversal occurs
through a competition between a current component determined at a commensurate
vortex density causing an enlargement of the unit cell, and another component,
which is proportional to the magnetic field doping from the corresponding
commensurate flux. The nearest-neighbor interaction along the rung direction

commonly neglected in the banking system modeling and systemic risk analysis.
We construct a model where banks are allowed to use both the interbank and the
securities markets to manage their liquidity demand and supply as driven by
prudential requirements in a volatile environment. The network of interbank
loans is dynamic and simulated every day. We show how only the intrasystem cash
fluctuations, without any external shocks, may lead to systemic defaults, what
may be a symptom of the self-organized criticality of the system. We also
analyze the impact of different prudential regulations and market conditions on
the interbank market resilience. We confirm that central bank's asset purchase
programs, limiting the declines in government bond prices, can successfully
stabilize bank's liquidity demand. The model can be used to analyze the
interbank market impact of macroprudential tools.

Common Neighbour Analysis, rely on interatomic distances (or thresholds

strain and thermal displacements, and preprocessing such as quenching or
temporal averaging of the atomic positions is necessary to provide reliable
identifications. We propose a new method, Polyhedral Template Matching (PTM),
which classifies structures according to the topology of the local atomic

reliability than e.g. Common Neighbour Analysis in the presence of thermal
fluctuations. We demonstrate that the method can reliably be used to identify
structures even in simulations near the melting point, and that it can identify
the most common ordered alloy structures as well. In addition, the method makes
it easy to identify the local lattice orientation in polycrystalline samples,
and to calculate the local strain tensor. An implementation is made available

Acad Sci USA 110: 17886-17891. 2013) were, as conventionally done, fitted by
the authors by a Boltzmann function, i.e. by a curvilinear profile. Reanalysis
of the data reveals however that this interpretation must be rejected in favor
of a multiphasic profile, a series of straight lines separated by discontinuous
transitions, quite often in the form of noncontiguities (jumps). In contrast to
the generally very poor fits to the Boltzmann profiles, the fits to multiphasic
profiles are very good. (For the four replicates, the average deviations from
the Boltzmann curves were 10- to 100-fold larger than the deviations from the
multiphasic profiles.) The difference in the median values was statistically
highly significant, P<0.001 in most cases. For the mean values the deviations
from the Boltzmann curve were 20-fold larger than the deviations from the
multiphasic profile, and the difference in the median values was also highly
significant. The curvilinear interpretation must be rejected also because of
the uneven distribution of the points around the Boltzmann curves. The combined
probability for the four replicates that this uneven distribution is due to
chance is less than 0.002.
  In addition to activation of ion channels, a wide variety of biological as
well as non-biological processes and phenomena involving binding, pH,

localization such as in negative differential conductivity, in jamming or
glassy behavior or in the slowing down of thermalization. Activities may decide
the direction of physical currents away from equilibrium, and the nature of the
stationary distribution, including its population inversion, is not as in
equilibrium decided by energy-entropy content. The ubiquity of non-dissipative

a more operational understanding and statistical forces outside equilibrium

When a transverse laser drives the atoms, the system undergoes a second order

maximizing scattering into the cavity and is controlled by the laser intensity.
Starting from a Fokker-Planck equation describing the semiclassical dynamics of
the $N$-atom distribution function, we systematically develop a mean-field
model and analyse its predictions for the equilibrium and out-of-equilibrium

numerical simulations of the $N$-body Fokker-Planck equation and by means of a
BBGKY hierarchy. The mean-field theory predictions well reproduce several
results of the $N$-body Fokker-Planck equation for sufficiently short times,
and are in good agreement with existing theoretical approaches based on
field-theoretical models. Mean-field, on the other hand, predicts
thermalization time scales which are at least one order of magnitude shorter
than the ones predicted by the $N$-body dynamics. We attribute this discrepancy
to the fact that the mean-field ansatz discards the effects of the long-range
incoherent forces due to cavity losses.

study involves microarray gene expression datasets, these are high-dimensional
and noisy datasets that contain genetic data typically used for distinguishing
between benign or malicious tissues or classifying different types of cancer.
In this paper, we formulate feature selection as a multiagent coordination
problem and propose a novel feature selection method using multiagent
reinforcement learning. The central idea of the proposed approach is to
""assign"" a reinforcement learning agent to each feature where each agent learns
to control a single feature, we refer to this approach as MARL. Applying this
to microarray datasets creates an enormous multiagent coordination problem
between thousands of learning agents. To address the scalability challenge we
apply a form of reward shaping called CLEAN rewards. We compare in total nine
feature selection methods, including state-of-the-art methods, and show that
the proposed method using CLEAN rewards can significantly scale-up, thus
outperforming the rest of learning-based methods. We further show that a hybrid
variant of MARL achieves the best overall performance.

refined to a correspondence between the braided-commutative Yetter--Drinfeld

Antenna (CRA) has been proposed as a way to provide high-sensing-capacity with
a minimum cost and complexity in the hardware architecture. The ADMM algorithm
applied to the imaging capabilities of the Compressive Antenna (CA) outperforms
current state of the art iterative reconstruction algorithms, such as
Nesterov-based methods, in terms of computational cost; and it ultimately
enables the use of a CA in quasi-real-time, compressive sensing imaging
applications.

(multi-beam converging apertures, material or magnetic lenses, and focusing
mirrors) and higher resolution detectors combined with the long flight paths
and long incident neutron wavelengths have been developed. In this paper, a
detailed review is given of the development, principles and application
conditions of various VSANS techniques. Then, beam current gain factors are

is lack of trust. Trusted autonomy is the scientific and engineering field to
establish the foundations and ground work for developing trusted autonomous
systems (robotics and software agents) that can be used in our daily life, and
can be integrated with humans seamlessly, naturally and efficiently.
  In this paper, we review this literature to reveal opportunities for
researchers and practitioners to work on topics that can create a leap forward
in advancing the field of trusted autonomy. We focus the paper on the `trust'
component as the uniting technology between humans and machines. Our inquiry
into this topic revolves around three sub-topics: (1) reviewing and positioning
the trust modelling literature for the purpose of trusted autonomy; (2)
reviewing a critical subset of sensor technologies that allow a machine to
sense human states; and (3) distilling some critical questions for advancing
the field of trusted autonomy. The inquiry is augmented with conceptual models
that we propose along the way by recompiling and reshaping the literature into
forms that enables trusted autonomous systems to become a reality. The paper
offers a vision for a Trusted Cyborg Swarm, an extension of our previous
Cognitive Cyber Symbiosis concept, whereby humans and machines meld together in
a harmonious, seamless, and coordinated manner.
