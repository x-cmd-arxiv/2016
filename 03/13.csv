  Tree Search","To appear in IEEE Transactions on Power Systems",,"10.1109/TPWRS.2016.2618365",,"cs.SY","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In the risk assessment of cascading outages, the rationality of simulation
and efficiency of computation are both of great significance. To overcome the
drawback of sampling-based methods that huge computation resources are required
and the shortcoming of initial contingency selection practices that the
dependencies in sequences of outages are omitted, this paper proposes a novel
risk assessment approach by searching on Markovian Tree. The Markovian tree
model is reformulated from the quasi-dynamic multi-timescale simulation model
proposed recently to ensure reasonable modeling and simulation of cascading
outages. Then a tree search scheme is established to avoid duplicated
simulations on same cascade paths, significantly saving computation time. To
accelerate the convergence of risk assessment, a risk estimation index is
proposed to guide the search for states with major contributions to the risk,
and the risk assessment is realized based on the risk estimation index with a
forward tree search and backward update algorithm. The effectiveness of the
proposed method is illustrated on a 4-node power system, and its convergence
profile as well as efficiency is demonstrated on the RTS-96 test system.

time, where the running cost of a control problem is evaluated by a probability
measure over R_+. Li, Quincampoix and Renault [DCDS-A, 2016] introduced an
asymptotic regularity condition for a sequence of probability measures to study
the limit properties of the value functions with respect to the evaluation. In
the particular case of t-horizon Ces\`aro mean or rho-discounted Abel mean,
this condition implies that the horizon t tends to infinity or the discount
factor rho tends to zero. For the control system defined on a compact domain
and satisfying some nonexpansive condition, Li, Quincampoix and Renault
[DCDS-A, 2016] proved the existence of general limit value, i.e. the value
function uniform converges as the evaluation becomes more and more regular.
Within the same context, we prove the existence of general uniform value, i.e.
for any epsilon>0, there is an optimal control that guarantees the general
limit value up to epsilon for all control problems where the cost is evaluated
by sufficiently regular probability measures.

interpretations prevailed: the meaning of the theory was expressed in terms of
measurements results. But in the last decades, several attempts to interpret it
from a realist viewpoint have been proposed. Among them, modal interpretations
supply a realist non-collapse account, according to which the system always has
definite properties and the quantum state represents possibilities, not
actualities. However, the traditional modal interpretations faced some
conceptual problems when addressing imperfect measurements. The
modal-Hamiltonian interpretation, on the contrary, proved to be able to supply
an adequate account of the measurement problem, both in its ideal and its
non-ideal versions. Moreover, in the non-ideal case, it gives a precise
criterion to distinguish between reliable and non-reliable measurements.
Nevertheless, that criterion depends on the particular state of the measured
system, and this might be considered as a shortcoming of the proposal. In fact,
one could ask for a criterion of reliability that does not depend on the
features of what is measured but only on the properties of the measurement
device. The aim of this article is precisely to supply such a criterion: we
will adopt an informational perspective for this purpose.

finite JC-lattices that finite component systems of coupled spins and bosons
may exhibit quantum phase transitions (QPT). For the JC-model we find a
continuous symmetry-breaking QPT, a photonic condensate with a macroscopic
occupation as the ground state and a Goldstone mode as a low-energy excitation.
For the two site JC-lattice we show analytically that it undergoes a
Mott-insulator to superfluid QPT. We identify as the underlying principle of
the emergence of finite size QPT the combination of increasing atomic energy
and increasing interaction strength between the atom and the bosonic mode which
allows for the exploration of an increasingly large portion of the infinite
dimensional Hilbert space of the bosonic mode. This suggests that finite system
phase transitions will be present in a broad range of physical systems.

thus associated with certain unitary representations of the groups $\vec{F}$

relies on some partition function interpretation of the Jones polynomial, and
also exhibit more examples associated with other link invariants, notably the

to end-user applications for secure access to personal data, smart services or
physical facilities. Similar to other biometric technologies, speaker
verification is vulnerable to spoofing attacks where an attacker masquerades as
a particular target speaker via impersonation, replay, text-to-speech (TTS) or
voice conversion (VC) techniques to gain illegitimate access to the system. We
focus on TTS and VC that represent the most flexible, high-end spoofing
attacks. Most of the prior studies on synthesized or converted speech detection
report their findings using high-quality clean recordings. Meanwhile, the
performance of spoofing detectors in the presence of additive noise, an
important consideration in practical ASV implementations, remains largely
unknown. To this end, we analyze the suitability of state-of-the-art synthetic
speech detectors under additive noise with a special focus on front-end
features. Our comparison includes eight acoustic feature sets, five related to
spectral magnitude and three to spectral phase information. Our extensive
experiments on ASVSpoof 2015 corpus reveal several important findings. Firstly,
all the countermeasures break down even at relatively high signal-to-noise
ratios (SNRs) and fail to generalize to noisy conditions. Secondly, speech
enhancement is not found helpful. Thirdly, GMM back-end generally outperforms
the more involved i-vector back-end. Fourthly, concerning the compared
features, the Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCCs) and subband spectral
centroid magnitude coefficients (SCMCs) perform the best on average though the
winner method depends on SNR and noise type. Finally, a study with two score
fusion strategies shows that combining different feature based systems improves
recognition accuracy for known and unknown attacks in both clean and noisy
conditions.

fault-tolerant logical gates that is both universal and transversal. This no-go
theorem is generally responsible for the interest in alternative universality
constructions including magic state distillation. Widely overlooked, however,
is the possibility of non-transversal, yet still fault-tolerant, gates that
work directly on small quantum codes. Here we demonstrate precisely the
existence of such gates. In particular, we show how the limits of
non-transversality can be overcome by performing rounds of intermediate
error-correction to create logical gates on stabilizer codes that use no
ancillas other than those required for syndrome measurement. Moreover, the
logical gates we construct, the most prominent examples being Toffoli and
controlled-controlled-Z, often complete universal gate sets on their codes. We
detail such universal constructions for the smallest quantum codes, the 5-qubit
and 7-qubit codes, and then proceed to generalize the approach. One remarkable
result of this generalization is that any nondegenerate stabilizer code with a
complete set of fault-tolerant single-qubit Clifford gates has a universal set
of fault-tolerant gates. Another is the interaction of logical qubits across
different stabilizer codes, which, for instance, implies a broadly applicable
method of code switching.

Unlike classical models that assume multivariate normality of the data, the
proposed copula is based on the assumption that some factors exist that affect
the joint spatial dependence of all measurements of each variable as well as
the joint dependence among these variables. The model is parameterized in terms
of a cross-covariance function that may be chosen from the many models proposed
in the literature. In addition, there are additive factors in the model that
allow tail dependence and reflection asymmetry of each variable measured at
different locations and of different variables to be modeled. The proposed
approach can therefore be seen as an extension of the linear model of
coregionalization widely used for modeling multivariate spatial data. The
likelihood of the model can be obtained in a simple form and therefore the
likelihood estimation is quite fast. The model is not restricted to the set of
data locations, and using the estimated copula, spatial data can be
interpolated at locations where values of variables are unknown. We apply the
proposed model to temperature and pressure data and compare its performance
with the performance of a popular model from multivariate geostatistics.

shocks across the full range of shock amplitudes, including the
infinite-amplitude limit, for monatomic or diatomic ideal gas equations of
state and viscosity and heat conduction coefficients $\mu$, $\mu +\eta$, and
$\nu=\kappa/c_v$ in the physical ratios predicted by statistical mechanics,
with Mach number $M>1.035$. Our results indicate unconditional stability within
the parameter range considered; this agrees with the results of Erpenbeck and
Majda for the corresponding inviscid case of Euler shocks. Notably, this study
includes the first successful numerical computation of an Evans function
associated with the multidimensional stability of a viscous shock wave. The
methods introduced may be used in principle to decide stability for any
$\gamma$-law gas, $\gamma>1$, and arbitrary $\mu>|\eta|\ge 0$, $\nu>0$ or,
indeed, for shocks of much more general models and equations, including in
particular viscoelasticity, combustion, and magnetohydrodynamics (MHD).

large networks under the frequency-selective interference channel. Performance
is measured by the weighted sum of achievable rates. First we present a natural
non-cooperative game theoretic formulation for this problem. It is shown that,
when interference is sufficiently strong, this game has a pure price of anarchy
approaching infinity with high probability, and there is an asymptotically
increasing number of equilibria with the worst performance. Then we propose a
novel non-cooperative M Frequency-Selective Interference Game (M-FSIG), where
users limit their utility such that it is greater than zero only for their M
best channels, and equal for them. We show that the M-FSIG exhibits, with high
probability, an increasing number of optimal pure Nash equilibria and no bad
equilibria. Consequently, the pure price of anarchy converges to one in
probability in any interference regime. In order to exploit these results
algorithmically we propose a modified Fictitious Play algorithm that can be
implemented distributedly. We carry out simulations that show its fast
convergence to the proven pure Nash equilibria.

The vertex connectivity of $G$, written $\kappa(G)$, is the minimum size of a

\le \kappa(G)$ for a non-complete simple graph $G$; for this reason $\mu_2(G)$
is called the ""algebraic connectivity"" of $G$. We extend his result to
multigraphs. For a pair of vertices $u$ and $v$, let $m(u,v)$ be the number of
edges with endpoints $u$ and $v$. For a vertex $v$, let $m(v)=\max_{u \in N(v)}
m(v,u)$, where $N(v)$ is the set of neighbors of $v$, and let $m(G)=\max_{v \in

invariant and contains nonlocal interactions, from which gauge bosons acquire
masses without breaking the local gauge symmetry. To demonstrate how the
general theory can be applied, we study a cold unmagnetized plasma and a cold
uniformly magnetized plasma. Using these two examples, we show that all linear
waves well-known in classical plasma physics can be recovered from relativistic
quantum results when taking the classical limit. In the opposite limit,
classical wave dispersion relations are modified substantially. In unmagnetized
plasmas, longitudinal waves propagate with nonzero group velocities even when
plasmas are cold. In magnetized plasmas, anharmonically spaced Bernstein waves
persist even when plasmas are cold. These waves account for cyclotron
absorption features observed in spectra of X-ray pulsars. Moreover, cutoff
frequencies of the two non-degenerate electromagnetic waves are redshifted by
different amounts. These corrections need to be taken into account in order to

algorithms rely on sequentially processing consecutive frames, by estimating
the transformation mapping the two frames, and obtaining a composite
transformation to a global motion compensated coordinate. Sequential GMC
suffers from temporal drift of frames from the accurate global coordinate, due
to either error accumulation or sporadic failures of motion estimation at a few
frames. We propose a temporally robust global motion compensation (TRGMC)
algorithm which performs accurate and stable GMC, despite complicated and
long-term camera motion. TRGMC densely connects pairs of frames, by matching
local keypoints of each frame. A joint alignment of these frames is formulated
as a novel keypoint-based congealing problem, where the transformation of each
frame is updated iteratively, such that the spatial coordinates for the start

adequately address privacy issues in this kind of data.
  This work looks at a recent generalization of differential privacy, called
Pufferfish, that can be used to address privacy in correlated data. The main
challenge in applying Pufferfish is a lack of suitable mechanisms. We provide
the first mechanism -- the Wasserstein Mechanism -- which applies to any
general Pufferfish framework. Since this mechanism may be computationally
inefficient, we provide an additional mechanism that applies to some practical
cases such as physical activity measurements across time, and is
computationally efficient. Our experimental evaluations indicate that this
mechanism provides privacy and utility for synthetic as well as real data in
two separate domains.

tasks. A non-linear analog of the PCA, called the Principal Geodesic Analysis
(PGA) suited for data lying on Riemannian manifolds was reported in literature
a decade ago. Since the objective function in PGA is highly non-linear and hard
to solve efficiently in general, researchers have proposed a linear
approximation. Though this linear approximation is easy to compute, it lacks
accuracy especially when the data exhibits a large variance. Recently, an
alternative called exact PGA was proposed which tries to solve the optimization
without any linearization. For general Riemannian manifolds, though it gives
better accuracy than the original (linearized) PGA, for data that exhibit large
variance, the optimization is not computationally efficient. In this paper, we
propose an efficient exact PGA for constant curvature Riemannian manifolds
(CCM-EPGA). CCM-EPGA differs significantly from existing PGA algorithms in two
aspects, (i) the distance between a given manifold-valued data point and the
principal submanifold is computed analytically and thus no optimization is
required as in existing methods. (ii) Unlike the existing PGA algorithms, the
descent into codimension-1 submanifolds does not require any optimization but
is accomplished through the use of the Rimeannian inverse Exponential map and
the parallel transport operations. We present theoretical and experimental
results for constant curvature Riemannian manifolds depicting favorable
performance of CCM-EPGA compared to existing PGA algorithms. We also present
data reconstruction from principal components and directions which has not been

demonstrate the first black phosphorus (BP) synaptic device, which offers
intrinsic anisotropy in its synaptic characteristics directly resulting from
its low crystal symmetry. The charge transfer between the 2-nm native oxide of
BP and the BP channel is utilized to achieve the synaptic behavior. Key

heterogeneity, including long-term potentiation/depression and
spike-timing-dependent plasticity, are mimicked. With the anisotropic BP

describe the set of unitaries generated by circuits composed of those gates.
Specifically, we allow the standard circuit operations of composition and
tensor product, as well as ancillary workspace qubits as long as they start and
end in states uncorrelated with the input, which rule out common ""magic state
injection"" techniques that make Clifford circuits universal. We show that there
are exactly 57 classes of Clifford unitaries and present a full classification
characterizing the gate sets which generate them. This is the first attempt at
a quantum extension of the classification of reversible classical gates
introduced by Aaronson et al., another part of an ambitious program to classify
all quantum gate sets.
  The classification uses, at its center, a reinterpretation of the tableau
representation of Clifford gates to give circuit decompositions, from which
elementary generators can easily be extracted. The 57 different classes are
generated in this way, 30 of which arise from the single-qubit subgroups of the
Clifford group. At a high level, the remaining classes are arranged according
to the bases they preserve. For instance, the CNOT gate preserves the X and Z
bases because it maps X-basis elements to X-basis elements and Z-basis elements
to Z-basis elements. The remaining classes are characterized by more subtle
tableau invariants; for instance, the T_4 and phase gate generate a proper
subclass of Z-preserving gates.

uniformly accelerated as a dense block by laser radiation pressure. In
addition, the beam quality of the accelerated ions is remarkably improved by
embedding the target in a thick enough substrate, which suppresses hot electron
refluxing and thus alleviates plasma heating. Particle-in-cell simulations
demonstrate that almost all ions in a solid-density plasma of a few microns can

an intensity around 1022 W/cm2. The resulting dense block of energetic ions may
drive fusion ignition and more generally create matter with unprecedented high

learn a classifier in the cross product space of the two domains, in the hard

Traditionally, the problem is approached by first addressing entity matching
and subsequently learning the classifier in a standard manner. We present an
end-to-end solution which bypasses matching entities, based on the recently
introduced concept of Rademacher observations (rados). Informally, we replace
the minimisation of a loss over examples, which requires to solve entity
resolution, by the equivalent minimisation of a (different) loss over rados.
Among others, key properties we show are (i) a potentially huge subset of these
rados does not require to perform entity matching, and (ii) the algorithm that
provably minimizes the rado loss over these rados has time and space
complexities smaller than the algorithm minimizing the equivalent example loss.
Last, we relax a key assumption of the model, that the data is vertically
partitioned among peers --- in this case, we would not even know the existence
of a solution to entity resolution. In this more general setting, experiments
validate the possibility of significantly beating even the optimal peer in

In
line with reliability theory, ""infant"" will refer here to the time interval
following birth during which the mortality (or failure) rate decreases. This
definition provides a systems science perspective in which birth constitutes a
sudden transition which falls within the field of application of the ""Transient
Shock"" (TS) conjecture put forward in Richmond et al. (2016c). This conjecture
provides predictions about the timing and shape of the death rate peak. (i) It
says that there will be a death rate spike whenever external conditions change
abruptly and drastically. (ii) It predicts that after a steep rising there will
be a much longer hyperbolic relaxation process. These predictions can be tested
by considering living organisms for which birth is a multi-step process. Thus,
for fish there are three states: egg, yolk-sac phase, young adult. The TS
conjecture predicts a mortality spike at the end of the yolk-sac phase, and
this timing is indeed confirmed by observation. Secondly, the hyperbolic nature
of the relaxation process can be tested using high accuracy Swiss statistics
which give postnatal death rates from one hour after birth up to the age of 10
years. It turns out that since the 19th century despite a great overall
reduction in infant mortality, the shape of the age-specific death rate has
remained basically unchanged. This hyperbolic pattern is not specific to
humans. It can also be found in small primates as recorded in the archives of
zoological gardens. Our ultimate objective is to set up a chain of cases which
starts from simple systems and then moves up step by step to more complex
organisms. The cases discussed here can be seen as initial landmarks.

(1+1)-dimensional system in a phase near a quantum phase transition. In
particular, in proximity to a quantum phase transition described by a conformal
field theory (CFT), the system is represented by a gapped Lorentz invariant
field theory in the ""scaling limit"" (correlation length $\xi$ much larger than
microscopic 'lattice' scale $a$), and can be thought of as a CFT perturbed by a
relevant perturbation. We show that for such (1+1) gapped Lorentz invariant
field theories in infinite space, the low-lying entanglement spectrum obtained
by tracing out, say, left half-infinite space, is precisely equal to the
physical spectrum of the unperturbed gapless, i.e. conformal field theory
defined on a finite interval of length $L_\xi=$ $\log(\xi/a)$ with certain
boundary conditions. In particular, the low-lying entanglement spectrum of the
gapped theory is the finite-size spectrum of a boundary conformal field theory,
and is always discrete and universal. Each relevant perturbation, and thus each
gapped phase in proximity to the quantum phase transition, maps into a
particular boundary condition. A similar property has been known to hold for
Baxter's Corner Transfer Matrices in a very special class of fine-tuned, namely
integrable off-critical lattice models, for the entire entanglement spectrum
and independent of the scaling limit. In contrast, our result applies to
completely general gapped Lorentz invariant theories in the scaling limit,
without the requirement of integrability, for the low-lying entanglement
spectrum. - The finite-size spectra of the entanglement Hamiltonian and of the
physical Hamiltonian on an interval of length R exhibit entirely different
behaviors upon crossover from the critical regime $R \ll \xi$ to the gapped

applications. In this paper first the formulation and extension of negative
imaginary and counter-clockwise systems as (nonlinear) input-output Hamiltonian
systems with dissipation is summarized. Next it is shown how by considering the
time-derivative of the outputs a port-Hamiltonian system is obtained, and how
this leads to the consideration of alternate passive outputs for
port-Hamiltonian systems. Furthermore, a converse result to positive feedback
interconnection of input-output Hamiltonian systems with dissipation is
obtained, stating that the positive feedback interconnection of two linear
systems is an input-output Hamiltonian system with dissipation if and only if
the systems themselves are input-output Hamiltonian systems with dissipation.
This implies that the Poisson and resistive structure matrices can be redefined
in such a way that the interaction between the two systems only takes place via
the coupling term in the Hamiltonian of the interconnected system.
Subsequently, it is shown how network interconnection of (possibly nonlinear)
input-output Hamiltonian systems with dissipation results in another
input-output Hamiltonian system with dissipation, and how this leads to a
stability analysis of the interconnected system in terms of the Hamiltonians
and output mappings of the systems associated to the vertices, as well as the
topology of the network.

  Wireless Optical Channels in the Presence of Air Bubbles",,,,,"cs.IT math.IT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In this paper, we experimentally investigate the statistical distribution of
intensity fluctuations for underwater wireless optical channels under different
channel conditions, namely fresh and salty underwater channels with and without
air bubbles. To do so, we first measure the received optical signal with a
large number of samples. Based on the normalized acquired data the channel
coherence time and the fluctuations probability density function (PDF) are
obtained for different channel scenarios. Our experimental results show that
salt attenuates the received signal while air bubbles mainly introduce severe
intensity fluctuations. Moreover, we observe that log-normal distribution
precisely fits the acquired data PDF for scintillation index ($\sigma^2_I$)
values less than $0.1$, while Gamma-Gamma and K distributions aptly predict the
intensity fluctuations for $\sigma^2_I>1$. Since neither of these distributions
are capable of predicting the received irradiance for $0.1<\sigma^2_I<1$, we
propose a combination of an exponential and a log-normal distributions to
perfectly describe the acquired data PDF for such regimes of scintillation
index.

Both planets harbour chemically complex clouds that are made of mineral

abundances of the atmosphere in the cloud forming regions. Hydrocarbon and
cyanopolyyne molecules can be rather abundant in the inner, dense part of the

see that obscuring clouds exist high in the atmosphere of HD209458b, but much

biological samples well beyond the diffraction limit of light, but they vary

analysis of temporal fluctuations as in superresolution optical fluctuation
imaging (SOFI) also enable imaging beyond diffraction limit, but usually at a
lower resolution as compared to SMLM. Since the same data format is acquired

thus may be combined synergistically to improve overall imaging performance.
Here, we find that SOFI converges much faster than SMLM, provides additive

These materials are doped (\emph{n}- or \emph{p}-type) oxides with a large
enough band gap (ideally $>$3~eV) to ensure transparency. However, the high
carrier concentration present in TCOs lead additionally to the possibility for
optical transitions from the occupied conduction bands to higher states for
\emph{n}-type materials and from lower states to the unoccupied valence bands
for \emph{p}-type TCOs. The ""second gap"" formed by these transitions might
limit transparency and a large second gap has been sometimes proposed as a
design criteria for high performance TCOs. Here, we study the influence of this
second gap on optical absorption using \emph{ab initio} computations for
several well-known \emph{n}- and \emph{p}-type TCOs. Our work demonstrates that
most known \emph{n}-type TCOs do not suffer from second gap absorption in the
visible even at very high carrier concentrations. On the contrary,
\emph{p}-type oxides show lowering of their optical transmission for high
carrier concentrations due to second gap effects. We link this dissimilarity to
the different chemistries involved in \emph{n}- versus typical \emph{p}-type
TCOs. Quantitatively, we show that second gap effects lead to only moderate
loss of transmission (even in p-type TCOs) and suggest that a wide second gap,

optimal numerical solutions to the Vlasov-Poisson equation. Unlike the
traditional particle-in-cell (PIC) method, which is commonly used for solving
this problem, the AP-Cloud adaptively selects computational nodes or particles
to deliver higher accuracy and efficiency when the particle distribution is
highly non-uniform. Unlike other adaptive techniques for PIC, our method
balances the errors in PDE discretization and Monte Carlo integration, and
discretizes the differential operators using a generalized finite difference
(GFD) method based on a weighted least square formulation. As a result,
AP-Cloud is independent of the geometric shapes of computational domains and is
free of artificial parameters. Efficient and robust implementation is achieved
through an octree data structure with 2:1 balance. We analyze the accuracy and
convergence order of AP-Cloud theoretically, and verify the method using an
electrostatic problem of a particle beam with halo. Simulation results show
that the AP-Cloud method is substantially more accurate and faster than the
traditional PIC, and it is free of artificial forces that are typical for some
adaptive PIC techniques.

with strong spin-orbit coupling and unique crystal lattices. Doped bismuth
selenide (Bi$_2$Se$_3$) is a strong candidate given the topological insulator
nature of the parent compound and its triangular lattice. The coupling between
the physical properties in the superconducting state and its underlying crystal
symmetry is a crucial test for unconventional superconductivity. In this paper,
we report direct evidence that the superconducting magnetic response couples
strongly to the underlying 3-fold crystal symmetry in the recently discovered
superconductor with trigonal crystal structure, niobium (Nb)-doped bismuth
selenide (Bi$_2$Se$_3$). More importantly, we observed that the magnetic
response is greatly enhanced along one preferred direction spontaneously
breaking the rotational symmetry. Instead of a simple 3-fold crystalline
symmetry, the superconducting hysteresis loop shows dominating 2-fold and
4-fold symmetry. This observation confirms the breaking of the rotational
symmetry and indicates the presence of nematic order in the superconducting
ground state of Nb-doped Bi$_2$Se$_3$. Further, heat capacity measurements
display an exponential decay in superconducting state and suggest that there is
no line node in the superconducting gap. These observations provide strong
evidence of odd-parity topological superconductivity.

superconductors using the renormalization group (RG). We seek to extend earlier
work on the crossover from the Fermi liquid state to the pseudo gap phase based
on RG flows in the so-called saddle point regime. Progress in the derivation of
effective models for the conjectured spin liquid state has been hindered, by
the difficulties involved in solving the strong coupling low energy
Hamiltonian. We tackle the problem by introducing an orthogonal wave packet
basis, the so-called Wilson-Wannier (WW) basis, that can be used to interpolate
between the momentum space and the real space descriptions.
  We show how to combine the WW basis with the RG, such that the RG is used to
eliminate high-energy degrees of freedom, and the remaining strongly correlated
system is solved approximately in the WW basis. We exemplify the approach for
different one-dimensional model systems, and find good qualitative agreement
with exact solutions even for very simple approximations.
  Finally, we reinvestigate the saddle point regime of the two-dimensional
Hubbard model. We show that the anti-nodal states are driven to an insulating
spin-liquid state with strong singlet pairing correlations, thus corroborating
earlier conjectures.

many applications. Previous algorithms require substantial user interactions to
estimate the foreground and background distributions. In this paper, we present
a novel deep learning based algorithm which has a much better understanding of
objectness and thus can reduce user interactions to just a few clicks. Our
algorithm transforms user provided positive and negative clicks into two
Euclidean distance maps which are then concatenated with the RGB channels of
images to compose (image, user interactions) pairs. We generate many of such
pairs by combining several random sampling strategies to model user click
patterns and use them to fine tune deep Fully Convolutional Networks (FCNs).
Finally the output probability maps of our FCN 8s model is integrated with
graph cut optimization to refine the boundary segments. Our model is trained on
the PASCAL segmentation dataset and evaluated on other datasets with different
object classes. Experimental results on both seen and unseen objects clearly
demonstrate that our algorithm has a good generalization ability and is
superior to all existing interactive object selection approaches.

regional dialects. We suggest that the process of dialect formation is
analogous to the physical process of magnetic domain formation. We take the
coastal breeding grounds of the Puget Sound white crowned sparrow as an
example. Previous field studies suggest that birds of this species learn
multiple songs early in life, and when establishing a territory for the first
time, retain one of these dialects in order to match the majority of their
neighbours. We introduce a simple lattice model of the process, showing that
this matching behaviour can produce single dialect domains provided the death
rate of adult birds is sufficiently low. We relate death rate to thermodynamic
temperature in magnetic materials, and calculate the critical death rate by
analogy with the Ising model. Using parameters consistent with the known
behavior of these birds we show that coastal dialect domain shapes may be
explained by viewing them as low temperature ""stripe states"".
