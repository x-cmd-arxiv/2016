given sets of $k$ terminal pairs that can be routed via edge-disjoint paths
(MaxEDP) or node-disjoint paths (MaxNDP) in a given graph. The approximability
of MaxEDP/NDP is currently not well understood; the best known lower bound is
$\Omega(\log^{1/2-\epsilon}{n})$, assuming
NP$~\not\subseteq~$ZPTIME$(n^{\mathrm{poly}\log n})$. This constitutes a
significant gap to the best known approximation upper bound of $O(\sqrt{n})$
due to Chekuri et al. (2006) and closing this gap is currently one of the big
open problems in approximation algorithms. In their seminal paper, Raghavan and
Thompson (Combinatorica, 1987) introduce the technique of randomized rounding
for LPs; their technique gives an $O(1)$-approximation when edges (or nodes)
may be used by $O(\frac{\log n}{\log\log n})$ paths.
  In this paper, we strengthen the above fundamental results. We provide new
bounds formulated in terms of the feedback vertex set number $r$ of a graph,
which measures its vertex deletion distance to a forest. In particular, we
obtain the following.
  * For MaxEDP, we give an $O(\sqrt{r}\cdot \log^{1.5}{kr})$-approximation
algorithm. As $r\leq n$, up to logarithmic factors, our result strengthens the
best known ratio $O(\sqrt{n})$ due to Chekuri et al.
  * Further, we show how to route $\Omega(\mathrm{OPT})$ pairs with congestion
$O(\frac{\log{kr}}{\log\log{kr}})$, strengthening the bound obtained by the
classic approach of Raghavan and Thompson.
  * For MaxNDP, we give an algorithm that gives the optimal answer in time
$(k+r)^{O(r)}\cdot n$. If $r$ is at most triple-exponential in $k$, this
improves the best known algorithm for MaxNDP with parameter $k$, by
Kawarabayashi and Wollan (STOC 2010).
  We complement these positive results by proving that MaxEDP is NP-hard even
for $r=1$, and MaxNDP is W$[1]$-hard for parameter $r$.

indicating the splashback radius has drawn much attention recently. Possible
observational detections have even been made for galaxy clusters.
Theoretically, Adhikari et al. have estimated the location of the splashback
radius by computing the secondary infall trajectory of a dark matter shell
through a growing dark matter halo with an NFW profile. However, since they
imposed a shape of the halo profile rather than computing it consistently from
the trajectories of the dark matter shells, they could not provide the full
shape of the dark matter profile around the splashback radius. We improve on
this by extending the self-similar spherical collapse model of Fillmore \&
Goldreich to a $\Lambda$CDM universe. This allows us to compute the dark matter
halo profile and the trajectories simultaneously from the mass accretion
history. Our results on the splashback location agree qualitatively with
Adhikari et al. but with small quantitative differences at large mass accretion
rates. We present new fitting formulae for the splashback radius $R_{\rm sp}$
in various forms, including the ratios of $R_{\rm sp} / R_{\rm 200c}$ and
$R_{\rm sp} / R_{\rm 200m}$. Numerical simulations have made the puzzling
discovery that the splashback radius scales well with $R_{\rm 200m}$ but not
with $R_{\rm 200c}$. We trace the origin of this to be the correlated increase
of $\Omega_{\rm m}$ and the average halo mass accretion rate with an increasing
redshift.

numerical simulation approaches to produce PDC hazard maps, based on a
comprehensive spectrum of flow properties and vent locations. These maps and
provide all probable Volcanic Explosivity Index (VEI) scenarios from different
source vents in the caldera, relevant for risk management planning. For each
VEI scenario, we report the conditional probability for PDCs (i.e., the
probability for a given area to be affected by the passage of PDCs) and related
dynamic pressure. Model results indicate that PDCs from VEI<4 events would be
confined within the Campi Flegrei caldera, PDC propagation being impeded by the
northern and eastern caldera walls. Conversely, PDCs from VEI 4-5 events could
invade a wide area beyond the northern caldera rim, as well as part of the
Naples metropolitan area to the east. A major controlling factor of PDC
dispersal is represented by the location of the vent area. PDCs from the
potentially largest eruption scenarios (analogous to the ~15 ka, VEI 6
Neapolitan Yellow Tuff or even the ~39 ka, VEI 7 Campanian Ignimbrite extreme
event) would affect a large part of the Campanian Plain to the north and the
city of Naples to the east. Thus, in case of renewal of eruptive activity at

hazard, pointing out the urgency of an emergency plan. Considering the present
level of uncertainty in forecasting the future eruption type, size and location

the underlying non-commutative geometry (NCG), which in these models is
extended to a left-right symmetric completion of the Standard Model (SM).
Within such \textit{unified} $SU(2)_L\times SU(2)_R\times SU(4)$ models the
Higgs content is restrictively determined from the underlying NCG, instead of
being arbitrarily selected. We show that the observed cross sections involving
the $750$ GeV diphoton resonance could be realized through a SM singlet scalar
field accompanied by colored scalars, present in these unified models. In view
of this result we discuss the underlying rigidity of these models in the NCG

great importance for materials research and development. Approximately all the
parameters of a material are temperature dependent, so we can't directly apply
the $\eta_\text{max}$ formula for efficiency calculation in the large

efficiency of TEG by dividing large working temperature range into a number of
small temperature difference. The aim is to make temperature dependent
parameter to be constant for that small temperature range. Using maximum
individual efficiency of each segment obtained by $\eta_\text{max}$ in the
equation of $\eta_\text{overall}$, which gives overall efficiency. The
$\eta_\text{overall}$ of TEG using $Bi_2Te_3$ and $TAGS$ as thermoelectric
materials come out to be $7.1\%$ and $8.94\%$, respectively, which is close to
experimental results. For the high-temperature region, we have used $SiGe$
material in TEG and found out $\eta_\text{overall}=3.5\%$. The cumulative
efficiency obtained by keeping one end temperature fixed with another end

thermal conductivity, electrical conductivity, and Seebeck coefficient on which

connected serial transitive Kripke frame.
  This yields completeness theorems over $X$ for a number of languages: (i) the

tangled closure operators $\langle t \rangle$; (iii) $\Diamond,\forall$; (iv)

MSSM is gauged and three MSSM gauge-singlet chiral multiplets with a unit $B-L$
charge are introduced, ensuring the model free from gauge and gravitational
anomalies. We assign an odd R-parity for two of the new chiral multiplets and
hence they are identified with the right-handed neutrino superfields, while an
even R-parity is assigned to the other one ($\Phi$). The scalar component of
$\Phi$ plays the role of a Higgs field to break the U(1)$_{B-L}$ symmetry
through its negative mass squared, which is radiatively generated by the
renormalization group running of soft supersymmetry (SUSY) breaking parameters
from a high energy. This radiative U(1)$_{B-L}$ symmetry breaking leads to its
breaking scale being at the TeV naturally. Because of our novel R-parity
assignment, three light neutrinos are Dirac particles with one massless state.
Since R-parity is conserved, the lightest neutralino is a prime candidate of
the dark matter as usual. In our model, the lightest eigenstate of the mixture
of the $B-L$ gaugino and the fermionic component of $\Phi$ appears as a new
dark matter candidate. We investigate phenomenology of this dark matter
particle. We also discuss collider phenomenology of our model. In particular,
the $B-L$ gauge boson ($Z'$), once discovered at the Large Hadron Collider, can
be a probe to determine the number of (right-handed) Dirac neutrinos with its
invisible decay width, in sharp contrast with the conventional $B-L$ extension

modeled within a mathematical framework where the kinematics is a direct
extension of the classical way of identifying these line defects with
singularities of a unit vector field representing the nematic director. It is
well known that the universally accepted Oseen-Frank energy is infinite for
configurations that contain disclination line defects. We devise a natural
augmentation of the Oseen-Frank energy to account for physical situations
where, under certain conditions, infinite director gradients have zero
associated energy cost, as would be necessary for modeling half-integer
strength disclinations within the framework of the director theory. Equilibria
and dynamics (in the absence of flow) of line defects are studied within the
proposed model. Using appropriate initial/boundary data, the gradient-flow
dynamics of this energy leads to non-singular, line defect equilibrium
solutions, including those of half-integer strength. However, we demonstrate
that the gradient flow dynamics for this energy is not able to adequately
describe defect evolution. Motivated by similarity with dislocation dynamics in
solids, a novel 2D-model of disclination dynamics in nematics is proposed. The
model is based on the extended Oseen-Frank energy and takes into account
thermodynamics and the kinematics of conservation of defect topological charge.
We validate this model through computations of disclination equilibria,
annihilation, repulsion, and splitting. We show that the energy function we
devise, suitably interpreted, can serve as well for the modeling of equilibria
and dynamics of dislocation line defects in solids making the conclusions of
this paper relevant to mechanics of both solids and liquid crystals.

Hayes","Generalised rely-guarantee concurrency: An algebraic foundation","23 pages, 3 figures, submitted to Formal Aspects of Computing",,,,"cs.LO","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The rely-guarantee technique allows one to reason compositionally about
concurrent programs. To handle interference the technique makes use of rely and
guarantee conditions, both of which are binary relations on states. A rely
condition is an assumption that the environment performs only atomic steps
satisfying the rely relation and a guarantee is a commitment that every atomic
step the program makes satisfies the guarantee relation. In order to
investigate rely-guarantee reasoning more generally, in this paper we allow
interference to be represented by a process rather than a relation and hence
derive more general rely-guarantee laws. The paper makes use of a weak
conjunction operator between processes, which generalises a guarantee relation
to a guarantee process, and introduces a rely quotient operator, which
generalises a rely relation to a process. The paper focuses on the algebraic
properties of the general rely-guarantee theory. The Jones-style rely-guarantee
theory can be interpreted as a model of the general algebraic theory and hence
the general laws presented here hold for that theory.

reflected by the shock. For the reflected ions by the shock, they may suffer
multiple stage acceleration when moving along the shock surface, or trapped
between the upstream waves and the shock front. At last, these ions may escape

Physical origin
of which, however, remain elusive despite intensive studies during last two

for ten proteins with different sizes and folds, we found that nonlinear
backbone torsional pair (BTP) correlations, which are spatially more
long-ranged and are mainly executed by loop residues, exist extensively in most
analyzed proteins. Examination of torsional motion for correlated BTPs
suggested that aharmonic torsional state transitions are essential for such
non-linear correlations, which correspondingly occur on widely different and
relatively longer time scales. In contrast, BTP correlations between backbone
torsions in stable $\alpha$ helices and $\beta$ strands are mainly linear and
spatially more short-ranged, and are more likely to associate with intra-well
torsional dynamics. Further analysis revealed that the direct cause of
non-linear contributions are heterogeneous, and in extreme cases canceling,
linear correlations associated with different torsional states of participating
torsions. Therefore, torsional state transitions of participating torsions for
a correlated BTP are only necessary but not sufficient condition for
significant non-linear contributions. These findings implicate a general search
strategy for novel allosteric modulation of protein activities. Meanwhile, it
was suggested that ensemble averaged correlation calculation and static contact
network analysis, while insightful, are not sufficient to elucidate mechanisms
underlying allosteric signal transmission in general, dynamical and time scale

systems, respectively, after taking a geometrical angular average of ${\bf a}$
and ${\bf b}$ with fixed $\cos\varphi={\bf a}\cdot{\bf b}$. Here $-1\leq C\leq
1$, and the difference in the numerical coefficients $1/2$ and $1/3$ arises
from the different rotational properties of the spinor and the transverse
photon. If one instead takes an average over the states in the $d=2$ Hilbert
space, the criterion for two photon systems is replaced by $4{\rm Tr}\rho
\{P({\bf a})\otimes P({\bf b})\}=1+(1/3)C\cos2\varphi$.
  Those separability criteria are shown to be very efficient using the existing

folding, docking and design. However, rigorous calculation of free energy
change is prohibitively expensive in these practical applications. The minimum
potential energy is therefore widely utilized to approximate free energy. In
this study, based on analysis of extensive molecular dynamics (MD) simulation
trajectories of a few native globular proteins, we found that change of minimum
and corresponding maximum potential energy terms exhibit similar level of
correlation with change of free energy. More importantly, we demonstrated that
change of span (maximum - minimum) of potential energy terms, which engender
negligible additional computational cost, exhibit considerably stronger
correlations with change of free energy than the corresponding change of
minimum and maximum potential energy terms. Therefore, potential energy span
may serve as an alternative efficient approximate free energy proxy.

its coordinates.
  Looking at random restrictions is necessary: we construct noise stable
functions whose correlation with any half-space is $o(1)$. The examples further
satisfy that different restrictions are correlated with different half-spaces:
for any fixed half-space, the probability that a random restriction is
correlated with it goes to zero.
  We also provide quantitative versions of the above statements, and versions
that apply for the Gaussian measure on $\mathbb{R}^n$ instead of the discrete

conditional distributions between the modalities. We use variational methods

the latent representation obtained from a single modality alone to be `close'

generated from attributes using the proposed model, are qualitatively and
quantitatively more representative of the attributes from which they were

the trap dynamics. This effect is intrinsic to ion Paul traps and sets the

of directing the radiation from the emitter toward the optical fiber and
efficiently phase-matching the photon emission with the fiber mode. Numerical
results show that an optical horn antenna can funnel up to 85% of the radiation
from a dipolar source within an emission cone semi-angle as small as 7 degrees
(antenna directivity of 300). It is also shown that 50% of the emitted power
from the dipolar source can be collected and coupled to an SMF-28 fiber mode
over spectral ranges larger than 1000 nm, with a maximum energy transfer
reaching 70 %. This approach is highly promising in the engineering of
all-fiber ""on-demand"" single photon sources for telecommunication, quantum
optics and sensing.

has been proven that they achieve capacity using power allocation and various
forms of iterative decoding. Empirical evidence has also strongly suggested
that the codes achieve capacity when spatial coupling and approximate message
passing decoding are used, without need of power allocation. In this note we
prove that state evolution (which tracks message passing) indeed saturates the

theory of low-density parity-check codes and compressive sensing.

  Molecular Communication",,,,,"cs.IT cs.ET math.IT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  An important challenge in design of modulation schemes for molecular
communication is positivity of the transmission signal (only a positive
concentration of molecules can be released in the environment). This
restriction makes handling of the InterSymbol Interference (ISI) a challenge
for molecular communication. Previous works have proposed use of chemical
reactions to remove molecules from the environment, and to effectively simulate
negative signals. However, the differential equation describing a
diffusion-reaction process is non-linear. This precludes the possibility of
using Fourier transform tools. In this paper, a solution for simulating
negative signals based on the diffusion-reaction channel model is proposed.
While the proposed solution does not exploit the full degrees of freedom
available for signaling in a diffusion-reaction process, but its end-to-end
system is a linear channel and amenable to Fourier transform analysis. Based on
our solution, a modulation scheme and a precoder are introduced and shown to
have a significant reduction in error probability compared to previous
modulation schemes such as CSK and MCSK. The effect of various imperfections
(such as quantization error) on the communication system performance are
studied.

consistent database that differs from the inconsistent one in a ""minimal way"".
Often, repairs are not equally legitimate, as it is desired to prefer one over
another; for example, one fact is regarded more reliable than another, or a
more recent fact should be preferred to an earlier one. Motivated by these
considerations, researchers have introduced and investigated the framework of
preferred repairs, in the context of denial constraints and subset repairs.
There, a priority relation between facts is lifted towards a priority relation
between consistent databases, and repairs are restricted to the ones that are
optimal in the lifted sense. Three notions of lifting (and optimal repairs)
have been proposed: Pareto, global, and completion.
  In this paper we investigate the complexity of deciding whether the priority
relation suffices to clean the database unambiguously, or in other words,
whether there is exactly one optimal repair. We show that the different lifting
semantics entail highly different complexities. Under Pareto optimality, the
problem is coNP-complete, in data complexity, for every set of functional
dependencies (FDs), except for the tractable case of (equivalence to) one FD
per relation. Under global optimality, one FD per relation is still tractable,
but we establish $\Pi^{p}_{2}$-completeness for a relation with two FDs. In
contrast, under completion optimality the problem is solvable in polynomial
time for every set of FDs. In fact, we present a polynomial-time algorithm for
arbitrary conflict hypergraphs. We further show that under a general assumption
of transitivity, this algorithm solves the problem even for global optimality.
The algorithm is extremely simple, but its proof of correctness is quite
intricate.

for tuning the transition temperature to the room-temperature operating
conditions of typical memory devices. We find an unusually strong dependence of
the structural energetics on the choice of exchange-correlation functional,
with the usual local density approximation (LDA) yielding the wrong
ground-state structure, and generalized gradient (GGA) extensions being in
better agreement with the bulk experimental structure. Using the GGA we show
the existence of a metastable face-centered-cubic (fcc)-like AFM structure that
is reached from the ground state body-centered-cubic (bcc) AFM structure by
following the epitaxial Bain path. We predict that this metastable fcc-like
structure has a significantly higher conductivity than the bcc AFM phase. We
show that the behavior is well described using non-linear elasticity theory,
which captures the softening and eventual sign change of the orthorhombic shear
modulus under compressive strain, consistent with this structural instability.

in-vehicle data networks. This technology can provide high-speed data
connectivity via the exploitation of the existing power network, with clear
potential benefits in terms of cost and weight reduction. The focus is on two
scenarios: an electric car and a cruise ship. An overview of the wiring
infrastructure and the network topology in these two scenarios is provided. The
main findings reported in the literature related to the channel characteristics
are reported. Noise is also assessed with emphasis to the electric car context.
Then, new results from the statistical analysis of measurements made in a
compact electric car and in a large cruise ship are shown. The channel
characteristics are analysed in terms of average channel gain, delay spread,
coherence bandwidth and achievable transmission rate. Finally, an overall
comparison is made, highlighting similarities and differences taking into
account also the conventional (combustion engine) car and the largely
investigated in-home scenario.

been done to determine the causes of the high rate of errors in spreadsheets.
This paper examines the added value of a spreadsheet tool (PerfectXL) that
visualizes spreadsheet dependencies and determines possible errors in
spreadsheets by defining risk areas based on previous work. This paper will
firstly discuss the most common mistakes in spreadsheets. Then we will
summarize research on spreadsheet tools, focussing on the PerfectXL tool. To
determine the perceptions of the usefulness of a spreadsheet tool in general
and the PerfectXL tool in particular, we have shown the functionality of
PerfectXL to several auditors and have also interviewed them. The results of
these interviews indicate that spreadsheet tools support a more effective and
efficient audit of spreadsheets; the visualization feature in particular is
mentioned by the auditors as being highly supportive for their audit task,
whereas the risk feature was deemed of lesser value.

isotropic expanding cosmological background (McVittie metric). We focus on
bound particle geodesics in a background including matter and phantom dark
energy with constant dark energy equation of state parameter $w<-1$ involving a
future Big Rip singularity at a time $t_{\ast}$. Such geodesics have been
previously studied in the Newtonian approximation and found to lead to
dissociation of bound systems at a time $t_{rip}<t_{\ast}$ which for fixed
background $w$, depends on a single dimensionless parameter $\bar{\omega}_0$
related to the angular momentum and depending on the mass and the size of the
bound system. We extend this analysis to large massive bound systems where the
Newtonian approximation is not appropriate and we compare the derived
dissociation time with the corresponding time in the context of the Newtonian
approximation. By identifying the time when the effective potential minimum
disappears due to the repulsive force of dark energy we find that the
dissociation time of bound systems occurs earlier than the prediction of the
Newtonian approximation. However, the effect is negligible for all existing
cosmological bound systems and it would become important only in hypothetical
bound extremely massive ($10^{20} M_\odot$) and large ($100Mpc$) bound systems.
We verify this result by explicit solution of the geodesic equations. This
result is due to an interplay between the repulsive phantom dark energy effects
and the existence of the well known innermost stable orbits of Schwarzschild
spacetimes.

decision analysis. In such models, a numerical value is associated to each
alternative involved in the decision problem. It is computed by aggregating the
scores of the alternative on the different criteria of the decision problem.
The score of an alternative is determined by a marginal value function that
evolves monotonically as a function of the performance of the alternative on
this criterion. Determining the shape of the marginals is not easy for a
decision maker. It is easier for him/her to make statements such as
""alternative $a$ is preferred to $b$"". In order to help the decision maker, UTA
disaggregation procedures use linear programming to approximate the marginals
by piecewise linear functions based only on such statements. In this paper, we
propose to infer polynomials and splines instead of piecewise linear functions
for the marginals. In this aim, we use semidefinite programming instead of
linear programming. We illustrate this new elicitation method and present some
experimental results.

absorbed in a way that can be derived from the Fresnel equations. The analysis
is treated in many textbooks, and implemented in many software programs, but
certain aspects of it are difficult to find explicitly and consistently worked
out in the literature. Here, we derive the formulas underlying the
transfer-matrix method of calculating the optical properties of these stacks,
including oblique-angle incidence, absorption-vs-position profiles, and
ellipsometry parameters. We discuss and explain some strange consequences of
the formulas in the situation where the incident and/or final (semi-infinite)
medium are absorptive, such as calculating $T>1$ in the absence of gain. We
also discuss some implementation details like complex-plane branch cuts.
Finally, we derive modified formulas for including one or more ""incoherent""
layers, i.e. very thick layers in which interference can be neglected. This
document was written in conjunction with the ""tmm"" Python software package,
which implements these calculations.

neutral current loop results in a moving current loop with a nonvanishing

this is not, in fact, correct. The derivation that leads to the charge
distribution was based on an incomplete Lorentz transformation, which
transforms the charge-current four-vector $j^\mu=[\rho({\bf r},t),{\bf
j(r},t)]$, but not the space-time four-vector $x^\mu=(t,{\bf r})$.
  We show that completing the Lorentz transformation by using the variable $t'$
in the moving frame, rather than keeping the rest frame time variable $t$,
results in there being no induced charge density and no resulting electric
dipole moment.

Here we develop a synthetic mortgage calculator that sufficiently accounts for
such costs and the implications on new monthly payments. To confirm the
accuracy of the calculator, we simulate the effects of refinancing over 15 and
30 year periods. We then model the effects of refinancing as risk to the issuer
