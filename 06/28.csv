SUSY specifically the scalar masses. If all the scalars are heavy,
supersymmetric contribution to the leptonic $g-2$ moments will be significantly
reduced. On the other hand the Brookhaven experiment indicates a 3sigma
deviation from the standard model prediction. Here we analyze the leptonic
$g-2$ moments in an extended MSSM model with inclusion of a vector like
leptonic generation which brings in new sources of CP violation. In this work
we consider the contributions to the leptonic $g-2$ moments arising from the
exchange of charginos and neutralinos, sleptons and mirror sleptons, and from
the exchange of $W$ and $Z$ bosons and of leptons and mirror leptons. We focus
specifically on the $g-2$ moments for the muon and the electron where sensitive
measurements exist. Here it is shown that one can get consistency with the
current data on $g-2$ under the Higgs boson mass constraint. Dependence of the
moments on CP phases from the extended sector are analyzed and it is shown that
they are sensitively dependent on the phases from the new sector. It is shown
that the corrections to the leptonic moments arising from the extended MSSM
sector will be non-vanishing even if the SUSY scale extends into the PeV
region.

sparse patterns of dependence among multiple time series extend existing
multivariate volatility models to enable scaling to higher numbers of
individual time series. The theory of these ""dynamic dependence network"" models
shows how the individual series can be ""decoupled"" for sequential analysis, and
then ""recoupled"" for applied forecasting and decision analysis. Decoupling
allows fast, efficient analysis of each of the series in individual univariate
models that are linked-- for later recoupling-- through a theoretical
multivariate volatility structure defined by a sparse underlying graphical
model. Computational advances are especially significant in connection with
model uncertainty about the sparsity patterns among series that define this
graphical model; Bayesian model averaging using discounting of historical

detailed case study showcases the use of these models, and the improvements in
forecasting and financial portfolio investment decisions that are achievable.

assessment of vacuum stability in either the Standard Model or any extension of

of the desired electroweak one gives strong constraints on the parameter space.
As the general parameter space in the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model is
huge, any severe constraint on it unrelated to direct phenomenological
observations enhances the predictability of the model. We perform an updated
analysis of possible charge and color breaking minima without relying on fixed
directions in field space that minimize certain terms in the potential (known

we argue that there are always directions in configuration space which lead to
very short-lived vacua and therefore such exclusions are strict. In addition to
existing strong constraints on the parameter space, we find even stronger
constraints extending the field space compared to previous analyses and combine
those constraints with predictions for the light CP-even Higgs mass in the

are excluded from vacuum stability in combination with the 125 GeV Higgs and

the presence of the dipolar interactions the local tunneling transports through

in many natural language processing and knowledge base inference tasks. Yet, a
major challenge is how to efficiently incorporate commonsense knowledge into
such models. A recent approach regularizes relation and entity representations
by propositionalization of first-order logic rules. However,
propositionalization does not scale beyond domains with only few entities and
rules. In this paper we present a highly efficient method for incorporating
implication rules into distributed representations for automated knowledge base
construction. We map entity-tuple embeddings into an approximately Boolean
space and encourage a partial ordering over relation embeddings based on
implication rules mined from WordNet. Surprisingly, we find that the strong
restriction of the entity-tuple embedding space does not hurt the
expressiveness of the model and even acts as a regularizer that improves
generalization. By incorporating few commonsense rules, we achieve an increase
of 2 percentage points mean average precision over a matrix factorization
baseline, while observing a negligible increase in runtime.

guiding conservation efforts. Using a 22-year time series of benthic
composition data from 20 reefs on the Kenyan and Tanzanian coast, we studied
the long-term behaviour of Bayesian vector autoregressive state-space models
for reef dynamics, incorporating among-site variability. We estimate that if
there were no among-site variability, the total long-term variability would be
approximately one third of its current value. Thus among-site variability
contributes more to long-term variability in reef composition than does
temporal variability. Individual sites are more predictable than previously
thought, and predictions based on current snapshots are informative about
long-term properties. Our approach allowed us to identify a subset of possible
climate refugia sites with high conservation value, where the long-term
probability of coral cover <= 0.1 was very low. Analytical results show that
this probability is most strongly influenced by among-site variability and by
interactions among benthic components within sites. These findings suggest that
conservation initiatives might be successful at the site scale as well as the

transition between short-term plasticity (STP) and long-term plasticity (LTP).
In this work, we show that this property can be exploited to efficiently solve
noisy classification tasks. A single crossbar learning scheme is first
introduced and evaluated. Perfect classification is possible only for simple
input patterns, within critical timing parameters, and when device variability
is weak. To overcome these limitations, a dual-crossbar learning system partly
inspired by the extreme learning machine (ELM) approach is then introduced.
This approach outperforms a conventional ELM-inspired system when the first
layer is imprinted before training and testing, and especially so when
variability in device timing evolution is considered: variability is therefore
transformed from an issue to a feature. In attempting to classify the MNIST
database under the same conditions, conventional ELM obtains 84%
classification, the imprinted, uniform device system obtains 88%
classification, and the imprinted, variable device system reaches 92%
classification. We discuss benefits and drawbacks of both systems in terms of
energy, complexity, area imprint, and speed. All these results highlight that
tuning and exploiting intrinsic device timing parameters may be of central
interest to future bio-inspired approximate computing systems.

SI suppression but beamforming is required to balance between the residual SI

to the received signals from the two sources in the current time slot. We
derive the optimally balanced relay beamforming and receive beamforming

endofunctor with certain natural transformations which make it behave like the
tangent bundle functor on the category of smooth manifolds. They provide an
abstract setting for differential geometry by axiomatizing key aspects of the
subject which allow the basic theory of these geometric settings to be
captured. Importantly, they have models not only in classical differential
geometry and its extensions, but also in algebraic geometry, combinatorics,
computer science, and physics.
  This paper develops the theory of ""differential bundles"" for such categories,
considers their relation to ""differential objects"", and develops the theory of
fibrations of tangent categories. Differential bundles generalize the notion of
smooth vector bundles in classical differential geometry. However, the
definition departs from the standard one in several significant ways: in
general, there is no scalar multiplication in the fibres of these bundles, and
in general these bundles need not be locally trivial.
  To understand how these differential bundles relate to differential objects,
which are the generalization of vector spaces in smooth manifolds, requires
some careful handling of the behaviour of pullbacks with respect to the tangent
functor. This is captured by ""transverse"" and ""display"" systems for tangent
categories, which leads one into the fibrational theory of tangent categories.
A key example of a tangent fibration is provided by the ""display"" differential
bundles of a tangent category with a display system. Strikingly, in such
examples the fibres are Cartesian differential categories demonstrating a --
not unexpected -- tight connection between the theory of these categories and
that of tangent categories.

through mutual inductive coupling to a coupler circuit containing a nonlinear
Josephson element. In this paper we derive the general interaction mediated by
such a circuit under the Born-Oppenheimer Approximation. This interaction
naturally decomposes into a classical part, with origin in the classical
circuit equations, and a quantum part, associated with the coupler's zero-point
energy. Our result is non-perturbative in the qubit-coupler coupling strengths
and in the coupler nonlinearity. This can lead to significant departures from
previous, linear theories for the inter-qubit coupling, including
non-stoquastic and many-body interactions. Our analysis provides explicit and
efficiently computable series for any term in the interaction Hamiltonian and
can be applied to any superconducting qubit type. We conclude with a numerical
investigation of our theory using a case study of two coupled flux qubits, and
in particular study the regime of validity of the Born-Oppenheimer
Approximation.

plasmonic optical tweezers in real-world applications, it is essential to
develop large-scale fabrication processes without compromising the trapping
efficiency. Here, we develop a novel platform for continuous wave (CW) and
femtosecond plasmonic optical tweezers, based on gold-coated black silicon. In
contrast with traditional lithographic methods, the fabrication method relies
on simple, single-step, maskless tabletop laser processing of silicon in water
that facilitates scalability. Gold-coated black silicon supports repeatable
trapping efficiencies comparable to the highest ones reported to date. From a
more fundamental aspect, a plasmon-mediated efficiency enhancement is a
resonant effect, and therefore, dependent on the wavelength of the trapping
beam. Surprisingly, a wavelength characterization of plasmon-enhanced trapping
efficiencies has evaded the literature. Here, we exploit the repeatability of
the recorded trapping efficiency, offered by the gold-coated black silicon
platform, and perform a wavelength-dependent characterization of the trapping
process, revealing the resonant character of the trapping efficiency maxima.
Gold-coated black silicon is a promising platform for large-scale parallel
trapping applications that will broaden the range of optical manipulation in
nanoengineering, biology, and the study of collective biophotonic effects.

uniform wall transpiration, is revisited. By focusing first on the results
obtained in Avsarkisov et al. (2014), we failed to reproduce two key results:
(i) For different transpiration rates at a constant Reynolds number, the mean
velocity profiles (in deficit form) do not universally collapse onto a single
curve as claimed. (ii) The universally proposed logarithmic scaling law in the
center of the channel does not match the direct numerical simulation (DNS) data
for the presented parameter values. In fact, no universal scaling behavior in
the center of the channel can be detected from their DNS data, as it is
misleadingly claimed in Avsarkisov et al. (2014). Moreover, we will demonstrate
that the assumption of a Reynolds-number independent symmetry analysis is not
justified for the flow conditions considered therein. Only when including also
the viscous terms, an overall consistent symmetry analysis can be provided.
This has been attempted in their subsequent study Oberlack et al. (2015). But,
also the (viscous) Lie-group-based scaling theory proposed therein is
inconsistent, apart from the additional fact that this study of Oberlack et al.

challenge is that likelihood-based methods require modeling the pixel
intensities inside and outside the image boundary, even though these are
typically of no practical interest. Since misspecification of the pixel
intensity models can negatively affect inference on the image boundary, it
would be desirable to avoid this modeling step altogether. Towards this, we
develop a robust Gibbs approach that constructs a posterior distribution for
the image boundary directly, without modeling the pixel intensities. We prove
that, for a suitable prior on the image boundary, the Gibbs posterior
concentrates asymptotically at the minimax optimal rate, adaptive to the
boundary smoothness. Monte Carlo computation of the Gibbs posterior is

this user assignment problem as an integer optimization problem, and propose an

optimality guarantees on such solutions, we opt to find lower bounds on the

the corresponding Dantzig-Wolfe decomposition, formulate the dual problem, and
show that the former offers a tighter bound than the latter. We highlight the
fact that the bounds in question consist of linear problems with an exponential
number of variables, and adapt the column generation method for solving them.
In addition to shedding light on the tightness of the bounds in question, our
numerical results show significant sum-rate gains over several comparison
schemes. Moreover, the proposed scheme delivers similar performance as W-MMSE
with a significantly lower complexity (around 10 times less).

between achievable spectral efficiency and power consumption in large-scale
MIMO systems. This makes it a promising candidate for millimeter wave systems,
which require deploying large antenna arrays at both the transmitter and
receiver to guarantee sufficient received signal power. Most prior work on
hybrid precoding focused on narrowband channels and assumed fully-connected
hybrid architectures. MmWave systems, though, are expected to be wideband with
frequency selectivity. In this paper, a closed-form solution for
fully-connected OFDM-based hybrid analog/digital precoding is developed for
frequency selective mmWave systems. This solution is then extended to
partially-connected but fixed architectures in which each RF chain is connected
to a specific subset of the antennas. The derived solutions give insights into
how the hybrid subarray structures should be designed. Based on them, a novel
technique that dynamically constructs the hybrid subarrays based on the
long-term channel characteristics is developed. Simulation results show that
the proposed hybrid precoding solutions achieve spectral efficiencies close to
that obtained with fully-digital architectures in wideband mmWave channels.
Further, the results indicate that the developed dynamic subarray solution
outperforms the fixed hybrid subarray structures in various system and channel
conditions.

integrates app usage data with the user-blog follow relations. In this approach
the blog recommendation is generated not only based on the blogs that the user
followed before, but also the apps that the user has often used. We demonstrate

modern buildings, the HVAC (heating, ventilation, and air conditioning) system
is centralised and operated by a department usually called the central plant.
The central plant produces chilled water and steam that is then consumed by the
building AHUs (Air Handling Units) to maintain the buildings at a comfortable
temperature. However, the heating and cooling model does not take into account
human occupancy. The AHU within the building distributes air according to the
design parameters of the building ignoring the occupancy. As a matter of fact,
there is a potential for optimization lowering consumption to utilize energy

consider in turn alternate strategies: (i) within-family data
orthogonalization, (ii) matrix substitution based on decomposition of a target

retaining covariances between unrelated pairs while orthogonalizing family

is easier, and then the min-max can be appropriately lifted to the original
operator on the infinite dimensional space. As one application, we mention some

a fixed interaction, and intermediate disorder below the many-body localization
transition, we find that, asymptotically, the number variance grows faster than
linear with a disorder dependent exponent. This is consistent with the
existence of an anomlaous Thouless energy in the spectrum. In non-interacting
disordered metals this is an energy scale related to the typical time for a
particle to diffuse across the sample. In the interacting case it seems related
to a more intricate anomalous diffusion process. This interpretation is not
fully consistent with recent claims that, for intermediate disorder, level
statistics are described by a plasma model with power-law decaying interactions
whose number variance grows slower than linear. As disorder is further
increased, still on the metallic side, the Thouless energy is gradually washed
out. In the range of sizes we can explore, level statistics are scale invariant
and approach Poisson statistics at the many-body localization transition.
Slightly below the many-body localization transition, spectral correlations,
well described by critical statistics, are quantitatively similar to those of a

long time so that recombination into bottomonia is possible. We show that
within this approach it is possible to understand the magnitude of
$\Upsilon(1S)$ suppression in heavy ion collisions and the larger suppression
of the $\Upsilon(2S)$ state, implying that the reduction in the ratio of

tessellated regions dominated by thermal emission. With some key improvements

fitting results with less residuals. The spatial distributions of the thermal
and ionization states of the ISM and ejecta show different features, which are
consistent with a scenario that the ISM (ejecta) is heated and ionized by the
forward (reverse) shock propagating outward (inward). Different elements have
different spatial distributions and origins, with Ne mostly from the ISM, Si
and S from the ejecta, and O and Mg from both ISM and ejecta. Fe L-shell lines
are only detected in a small shell-like region SE to the center of SN1006,
indicating that most of the Fe-rich ejecta has not yet or just recently been
reached by the reverse shock. The overall ejecta abundance patterns for most of
the heavy elements, except for Fe and sometimes S, are consistent with typical
Type~Ia SN products. The NW half of the SNR interior probably represents a
region with turbulently mixed ISM and ejecta, so has enhanced emission from O,
Mg, Si, S, lower ejecta temperature, and a large diversity of ionization age.
In addition to the asymmetric ISM distribution, an asymmetric explosion of the
progenitor star is also needed to explain the asymmetric ejecta distribution.

surface density and dust temperature a worrisome error spread especially close
to star-formation sites and low-density regions, where for those ""contaminated""
pixels the surface densities can be under/overestimated by up to three orders
of magnitude. In light of this, we recommend to treat the pixel-based results
from this technique with caution in regions with active star formation. In
regions of high background typical in the inner Galactic plane, we are not able
to recover reliable surface density maps of individual synthetic regions, since
low-mass regions are lost in the FIR background. When measuring the total gas
mass of regions in moderate background, we find that modified blackbody fitting
works well (absolute error:+9%;-13%) up to 10kpc distance (errors increase with
distance). Commonly, the initial images are convolved to the largest common
beam-size, which smears contaminated pixels over large areas. The resulting
information loss makes this commonly-used technique less verifiable as now
chi^2-values cannot be used as a quality indicator of a fitted pixel. Our
control measurements of the total gas mass (without the step of convolution to
the largest common beam size) produce similar results (absolute error:+20%;-7%)

Observational proof for this scenario has, however, been scarce. We have
assembled a sample of 132 radio-quiet type-2 and red AGN at 0.1<z<1. We measure
the kinematics of the AGN-ionized gas, the host galaxies' stellar masses and
star formation rates and investigate the relationships between AGN
luminosities, specific star formation rates (sSFR) and outflow strengths W90 --
the 90\% velocity width of the [OIII]5007 line power and a proxy for the
AGN-driven outflow speed. Outflow strength is independent of sSFR for AGN
selected on their mid-IR luminosity, in agreement with previous work
demonstrating that star formation is not sufficient to produce the observed
ionized gas outflows which have to be powered by AGN activity. More
importantly, we find a negative correlation between W90 and sSFR in the AGN
hosts with the highest SFRs, i.e., with the highest gas content, where
presumably the coupling of the AGN-driven wind to the gas is strongest. This
implies that AGN with strong outflow signatures are hosted in galaxies that are
more `quenched' than galaxies with weaker outflow signatures. Despite the
galaxies' high SFRs, we demonstrate that the outflows are not star-formation
driven but indeed due to AGN-powering. This observation is consistent with the
AGN having a net suppression, `negative' impact, through feedback on the

within a single parent core, have randomly oriented angular momenta. Although
the pairs migrate to closer separations, their spins remain partially
misaligned. We produce $^{12}$CO(2-1) synthetic observations of the simulations
and characterize the outflow orientation in the emission maps. The
CO-identified outflows exhibit a similar random distribution and are also
statistically consistent with the observed distribution of molecular outflows.
We conclude that observed misalignment provides a clear signature of binary
formation via turbulent fragmentation. The persistence of misaligned outflows
and stellar spins following dynamical evolution may provide a signature of
binary origins for more evolved multiple star systems.

exospheric sodium (Na) and singly ionized calcium (Ca$^+$) in the optical
transmission spectrum of the hot rocky super-Earth 55 Cancri e. Although the
current best-fitting models to the planet mass and radius require a possible
atmospheric component, uncertainties in the radius exist, making it possible
that 55 Cancri e could be a hot rocky planet without an atmosphere. High
resolution (R$\sim$110000) time-series spectra of five transits of 55 Cancri e,
obtained with three different telescopes (UVES/VLT, HARPS/ESO 3.6m &
HARPS-N/TNG) were analysed. Targeting the sodium D lines and the calcium H and
K lines, the potential planet exospheric signal was filtered out from the much
stronger stellar and telluric signals, making use of the change of the radial
component of the orbital velocity of the planet over the transit from -57 to
+57 km/sec. Combining all five transit data sets, we detect a signal
potentially associated with sodium in the planet exosphere at a statistical
significance level of 3$\sigma$. Combining the four HARPS transits that cover
the calcium H and K lines, we also find a potential signal from ionized calcium
(4.1 $\sigma$). Interestingly, this latter signal originates from just one of
the transit measurements - with a 4.9$\sigma$ detection at this epoch.
Unfortunately, due to the low significance of the measured sodium signal and
the potentially variable Ca$^+$ signal, we estimate the p-values of these
signals to be too high (corresponding to <4$\sigma$) to claim unambiguous
exospheric detections. By comparing the observed signals with artificial
signals injected early in the analysis, the absorption by Na and Ca$^+$ are
estimated to be at a level of approximately 2.3$\times 10^{-3}$ and 7.0$\times
10^{-2}$ respectively, relative to the stellar spectrum.

task, at both the conceptual and technical levels. Recently we developed a new
approach to compute such renormalized quantities in asymptotically-flat curved

spacetime to admit some symmetry. We already implemented this approach to
compute $\left\langle \phi^{2}\right\rangle _{ren}$ in a stationary spacetime
using t-splitting, namely splitting in the time-translation direction. Here we
present the angular-splitting version of this approach, aimed for computing
renormalized quantities in a general (possibly dynamical) spherically-symmetric
spacetime. To illustrate how the angular-splitting method works, we use it here
to compute $\left\langle \phi^{2}\right\rangle _{ren}$ for a quantum massless
scalar field in Schwarzschild background, in various quantum states (Boulware,
Unruh, and Hartle-Hawking states). We find excellent agreement with the results
obtained from the t-splitting variant, and also with other methods. Our main
goal in pursuing this new mode-sum approach was to enable the computation of
the renormalized stress-energy tensor in a dynamical spherically symmetric
background, e.g. an evaporating black hole. The angular-splitting variant
presented here is most suitable to this purpose.

realistic, large and porous particles using hierarchical aggregates, which
shows previous extrapolations to be inadequate. The main strengths of our
approach are that we can simulate very large (mm-scale) non-spherical
agglomerates and can accurately determine their 1) effective cross-section and
ratio of cross-section to mass, 2) gas drag coefficient, and 3) light
scattering properties. In practical terms, we find that a more detailed
treatment of the dust structure results in 3-5 times higher velocities for
large dust particles in the inner coma than previously estimated using
spherical particles of the same mass. We apply our model to the dynamics of
dust in the vicinity of the nucleus of comet 67P and successfully reproduce the
dust speeds reported early on when the comet was roughly 3.5 AU from the Sun.
At this stage, we employ a simple spherical comet nucleus, we model activity as

increases from 1 Myr to 30 Myr for gas metallicity $Z=0.05-1\,\rm Z_{\odot}$,
respectively. Next, we compute the time-dependent luminosity of key FIR lines
tracing the neutral and ionized gas layers of the GMCs, ([CII] at $158\,\rm{\mu
m}$, [OIII] at $88\,\rm \mu m$) as a function of $G_0$, and $Z$ until complete
photoevaporation at $t_{pe}$. We find that the specific [CII] luminosity is
almost independent on the GMC model within the survival time of the cloud.
Stronger FUV fluxes produce higher [CII] and [OIII] luminosities, however
lasting for progressively shorter times. At $Z=Z_{\odot}$ the [CII] emission is
maximized ($L_{\rm CII}\approx 10^4\,\rm{L_{\odot}}$ for the fiducial model)
for $t<1\,\rm{Myr}$ and $\log G_0\geq 3$. Noticeably, and consistently with the
recent detection by Inoue et al. (2016) of a galaxy at redshift $z\approx 7.2$,
for $Z\leq 0.2\,\rm{Z_{\odot}}$ the [OIII] line might outshine [CII] emission
by up to $\approx 1000$ times. We conclude that the [OIII] line is a key
diagnostic of low metallicity ISM, especially in galaxies with very young
stellar populations.

phase shift on the light depending upon the atomic state. By interfering the
light that passes through the BEC with the original light, one can obtain
information of the atomic state at a single shot level. We derive an exact

from PCI, as well as the back-action on the atomic state. By the use of exact
expressions for the measurement process, we go beyond the continuous variables
approximation such that the non-Gaussian regime can be accessed for both the
measured state and the post-measurement state. Features such as the photon
probability density, signal, signal variance, Fisher information, error of the
measurement, and the backaction are calculated by applying the measurement
operator to an atomic two spin state system. For an atomic state that is
initially in a spin coherent state, we obtain analytical expression for these

inversely proportional to the number of atoms, which maximizes the information

small values of the axion-gauge field coupling strength the results agree with
no-backreaction calculations and estimates found in the literature. For larger
couplings the helicity of the magnetic field differs from the no-backreaction
estimate and depends strongly on the comoving wavenumber. We estimate the
post-inflationary evolution of the magnetic field based on known results for
the evolution of helical and non-helical magnetic fields. The magnetic fields
produced by axion inflation with large couplings to $U(1)_Y$ can reach $B_{\rm

\approx 10^{-13}\, {\rm G}$ and a correlation length $\lambda_{\rm

the coupling, as long as the coupling is large enough to allow for
instantaneous preheating. Depending on the assumptions for the physical
processes that determine blazar properties, these fields can be found
consistent with blazar observations based on the value of $B_{\rm eff}$.
Finally, the intensity of the magnetic field for large coupling can be enough

quantum Monte Carlo (FCIQMC) method [Booth, G. H.; Thom, A. J. W.; Alavi, A. J.
Chem. Phys. 2009, 131, 054106]. To improve upon the linearized imaginary-time
propagator, we develop an optimal projector scheme based on an exponential
Chebyshev expansion in the limit of an infinite imaginary time step. After
writing the exact projector as a path integral in determinant space, we
introduce a path filtering procedure that truncates the size of the
determinantal basis and approximates the Hamiltonian. The path filtering
procedure is controlled by one real threshold that determines the accuracy of
the PCI energy and is not biased towards any determinant. Therefore, the PCI
approach can equally well describe static and dynamic electron correlation.
This point is illustrated in benchmark computation on N$_2$ at both equilibrium
and stretched geometries. In both cases, the PCI achieves chemical accuracy
with wave functions that contain less than 0.5% of the full CI space. We also
report computations on the ground state of C$_2$ with up to quaduple-$\zeta$
basis sets and wave functions as large as 200 million determinants, which allow
a direct comparison of the PCI, FCIQMC, and density matrix renormalization
group (DMRG) methods. The size of the PCI wave function grows modestly with the
number of unoccupied orbitals and its accuracy may be tuned to match that of
FCIQMC and DMRG.

cosmological magnetohydrodynamic simulations with radiation transport. Given
the theoretical uncertainty and weak observational constraints of magnetic
fields in the early universe, we initialize the simulations with identical

fields grow as $\rho^{2/3}$ during the gravitational collapse preceding star
formation, as expected from ideal spherical collapse models. Massive Population
III stars can expel a majority of the gas from the host halo through radiative
feedback, and we find that the magnetic fields are not amplified above the
spherical collapse scaling relation during this phase. However, afterwards when
its supernova remnant can radiatively cool and fragment, the turbulent velocity
field in and around the shell causes the magnetic field to be significantly

AGB stars that lived before the formation of the solar system reveal variations
in the interstellar medium chemical composition. The present generation of
low-mass AGB stars show a large spread of 16O/17O ratios, similar to that of
group 1 presolar grains and in agreement with theoretical expectations for the
composition of mass 1.2 to 2 Msun stars after the 1st dredge up. On the
contrary, the 16O/18O ratios of present-day LPVs are definitely smaller than
those of group 1 grains. This occurrence is most probably a consequence of the
the decrease with time of the 16O/18O ratio in the interstellar medium due to
the chemical evolution of the Milky Way. One star in our sample has an O
composition similar to that of group 2 presolar grains originating in an AGB

is the unique graph on ten vertices with $c(G)=3$, and all graphs on nine or
fewer vertices have $c(G)\leq 2$. (This was a self-contained mathematical proof
of a result found by computational search by Baird and Bonato.) In this

Backscattering can reflect a substantial portion of the incident laser energy.
This is a major loss mechanism, for example, in employing lasers in inertial
confinement fusion. However, by slow rotation of the incident linear
polarization, the overall reflectivity can be reduced significantly. Particle
in cell simulations show that, for parameters similar to those of indirect
drive fusion experiments, polarization rotation reduces the reflectivity by a
factor of $5$. A general, fluid-model based, analytical estimation for the
reflectivity reduction agrees with simulations. However, in identifying the
source of the backscatter reduction, it is difficult to disentangle the

the development of measurement methods of coronal magnetic fields a high
priority in solar physics. The Hanle effect in the UV and IR spectral lines is
a largely unexplored diagnostic. We use magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulations
to study the magnitude of the signal to be expected for typical coronal

vector representations of words on large text corpuses. The resulting vectors
have been shown to capture semantic relationships among their corresponding
words, and have shown promise in reducing a number of natural language
processing (NLP) tasks to mathematical operations on these vectors. While
heretofore applications of word2vec have centered around vocabularies with a
few million words, wherein the vocabulary is the set of words for which vectors
are simultaneously trained, novel applications are emerging in areas outside of
NLP with vocabularies comprising several 100 million words. Existing word2vec
training systems are impractical for training such large vocabularies as they
either require that the vectors of all vocabulary words be stored in the memory
of a single server or suffer unacceptable training latency due to massive
network data transfer. In this paper, we present a novel distributed, parallel
training system that enables unprecedented practical training of vectors for
vocabularies with several 100 million words on a shared cluster of commodity
servers, using far less network traffic than the existing solutions. We
evaluate the proposed system on a benchmark dataset, showing that the quality
of vectors does not degrade relative to non-distributed training. Finally, for
several quarters, the system has been deployed for the purpose of matching

mechanism. Numerous stars have been identified to possess a debris disk, a
proto-planetary disk or a planetary system. The understanding of such formation
process requires the study of debris disks. These targets are substantial and
particularly suitable for optical and infrared observations. Sparse Aperture
masking (SAM) is a high angular resolution technique strongly contributing to
probe the region from 30 to 200 mas around the stars. This area is usually
unreachable with classical imaging, and the technique also remains highly
competitive compared to vortex coronagraphy. Aims. We aim to study debris disks
with aperture masking to probe the close environment of the stars. Our goal is
either to find low mass companions, or to set detection limits. Methods. We
observed eight stars presenting debris disks ( $\beta$ Pictoris, AU
Microscopii, 49 Ceti, $\eta$ Telescopii, Fomalhaut, g Lupi, HD181327 and

companions were detected using closure phase information under 0.5 of
separation from the parent stars. We obtained magnitude detection limits that
we converted to Jupiter masses detection limits using theoretical isochrones

  machine learning problems",,,,,"cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  A particularly interesting instance of supervised learning with kernels is
when each training example is associated with two objects, as in pairwise
classification (Brunner et al., 2012), and in supervised learning of preference
relations (Herbrich et al., 1998). In these cases, one may want to embed
additional prior knowledge into the optimization problem associated with the
training of the learning machine, modeled, respectively, by the symmetry of its
optimal solution with respect to an exchange of order between the two objects,
and by its antisymmetry. Extending the approach proposed in (Brunner et al.,
2012) (where the only symmetric case was considered), we show, focusing on
support vector binary classification, how such embedding is possible through
the choice of a suitable pairwise kernel, which takes as inputs the individual
feature vectors and also the group feature vectors associated with the two
objects. We also prove that the symmetry/antisymmetry constraints still hold
when considering the sequence of suboptimal solutions generated by one version
of the Sequential Minimal Optimization (SMO) algorithm, and we present
numerical results supporting the theoretical findings. We conclude discussing
extensions of the main results to support vector regression, to transductive
support vector machines, and to several kinds of graph kernels, including
diffusion kernels.

smaller than the lightest charged fermion mass, namely the electron, and their
mixings can not be explained within the framework of the exceptionally
successful Standard Model. There are four ideas that has been proposed to
explain the tiny neutrino masses. These include the see-saw mechanism with a
right handed neutrino at the GUT scale, and this is the most elegant mechanism.
The other mechanisms are radiatively generated neutrino masses, the neutrino
mass arising from a 2nd Higgs doublet having a tiny VEV and coupling only to
the neutrinos, and finally the mirror model or simply the EW-scale $\nu_R$
model. The mirror model has new quarks and leptons of opposite chirality at the
electroweak scale (for the same Standard Model gauge symmetry $SU(2)_W \times
U(1)_Y$) compared to what we have for the Standard Model. With suitable
modification of the Higgs sector, the EW-scale $\nu_R$ model satisfies the
electroweak precision test and also the constraints coming from the observed
125-GeV Higgs scalar. Since in this model, the mirror fermions are required to
be in the EW scale, these can be produced at the LHC giving final states with a
very low background from the SM. One such final state is the same sign
dileptons with large missing $p_T$ for the events. In this work, we explore the
constraint provided by the $8$ TeV data, and prospect of observing this signal
in the $13$ TeV runs at the LHC. Additional signals will be the presence of
displaced vertices depending on the smallness of the Yukawa couplings of the
mirror leptons with the ordinary leptons and the singlet Higgs present in the
model. Of particular importance to the EW-scale $\nu_R$ model is the production
of $\nu_R$ which will be a direct test of the seesaw mechanism at collider
energies.

from singly occupied states become important in the strong correlation regime

input environment correlations. To emphasize this functioning, we designed an
information engine powered solely by temporal correlations and not by
statistical biases, as employed by previous engines. Key to this is the
engine's ability to synchronize---the engine automatically returns to a desired
dynamical phase when thrown into an unwanted, dissipative phase by corruptions
in the input---that is, by unanticipated environmental fluctuations. This
self-correcting mechanism is robust up to a critical level of corruption,
beyond which the system fails to act as an engine. We give explicit analytical
expressions for both work and critical corruption level and summarize engine
performance via a thermodynamic-function phase diagram over engine control

Subhalos identified by the AHF and ROCKSTAR halo finders have similar mass
functions, independent of resolution, but different radial distributions due to
significantly different subhalo hierarchies. We propose a simple way to
classify subhalos as galaxy analogues. The radial distributions of galaxy
analogues agree well at large halo-centric radii for both AHF and ROCKSTAR but
disagree near parent halo centres where the phase-space information used by
ROCKSTAR is essential.
  We see clear mass segregation at small radii (within $0.5\,r_{vir}$) with
average galaxy analogue mass decreasing with radius. Beyond the virial radius,
we find a mild trend where the average galaxy analogue mass increases with
radius. These mass segregation trends are strongest in small groups and
dominated by the segregation of low mass analogues. The lack of mass
segregation in massive galaxy analogues suggests that the observed trends are
driven by the complex accretion histories of the parent halos rather than
dynamical friction.

while the Antarctic sea ice cover is steadily expanding. State-of-the-art
climate models, by contrast, typically simulate a moderate decrease in both the
Arctic and Antarctic sea ice covers. However, in each hemisphere there is a
small subset of model simulations that have sea ice trends similar to the
observations. Based on this, a number of recent studies have suggested that the
models are consistent with the observations in each hemisphere when simulated
internal climate variability is taken into account. Here we examine sea ice
changes during 1979-2013 in simulations from the most recent Coupled Model
Intercomparison Project (CMIP5) as well as the Community Earth System Model
Large Ensemble (CESM-LE), drawing on previous work that found a close
relationship in climate models between global-mean surface temperature and sea
ice extent. We find that all of the simulations with 1979-2013 Arctic sea ice
retreat as fast as observed have considerably more global warming than
observations during this time period. Using two separate methods to estimate
the sea ice retreat that would occur under the observed level of global warming
in each simulation in both ensembles, we find that simulated Arctic sea ice
retreat as fast as observed would occur less than 1% of the time. This implies
that the models are not consistent with the observations. In the Antarctic, we
find that simulated sea ice expansion as fast as observed typically corresponds
with too little global warming, although these results are more equivocal. We
show that because of this, the simulations do not capture the observed
asymmetry between Arctic and Antarctic sea ice trends. This suggests that the
models may be getting the right sea ice trends for the wrong reasons in both
polar regions.

perihelion show continued mass loss consistent with the sublimation of
near-surface ice. Isophotes of the coma measured from a vantage point below the
orbital plane are best matched by steady emission of particles having a nominal
size $a \sim$ 100 $\mu$m. The inferred rate of mass loss, $dM_d/dt \sim$0.2 kg
s$^{-1}$, can be supplied by sublimation of water ice in thermal equilibrium
with sunlight from an area as small as 930 m$^2$, corresponding to about 0.2\%
of the nucleus surface. Observations taken from a vantage point only
0.6\degr~from the orbital plane of 324P set a limit to the velocity of ejection
of dust in the direction perpendicular to the plane, $V_{\perp} <$ 1 m
s$^{-1}$. Short-term photometric variations of the near-nucleus region, if
related to rotation of the underlying nucleus, rule out periods $\le$ 3.8 hr
and suggest that rotation probably does not play a central role in driving the
observed mass loss. We estimate that, in the previous orbit, 324P lost about
4$\times$10$^7$ kg in dust particles, corresponding to 6$\times$10$^{-5}$ of
the mass of a 550 m spherical nucleus of assumed density $\rho$ = 1000 kg
m$^{-3}$. If continued, mass loss at this rate would limit the lifetime of 324P
to $\sim$1.6$\times$10$^4$ orbits (about 10$^5$ yr). To survive for the 100 Myr
to 400 Myr timescales corresponding, respectively, to dynamical and collisional
stability requires a duty cycle $2\times 10^{-4} \le f_d \le 8\times 10^{-4}$.
Unless its time in orbit is over-estimated by many orders of magnitude, 324P is
revealed as a briefly-active member of a vast population of otherwise dormant
ice-containing asteroids.

parallel to the de Rham form developed by Beilinson-Drinfeld and
Arinkin-Gaitsgory, and the Dolbeault form of Donagi-Pantev, and inspired by the
work of Kapustin-Witten in supersymmetric gauge theory. The conjecture proposes
an automorphic category associated to a compact Riemann surface X and complex
reductive group G is equivalent to a spectral category associated to the
underlying topological surface S and Langlands dual group G^. The automorphic
category consists of suitable C-sheaves on the moduli stack Bun_G(X) of
G-bundles on X, while the spectral category consists of suitable O-modules on
the character stack Loc_G^(S) of G^-local systems on S. The conjecture is
compatible with and constrained by the natural symmetries of both sides coming
from modifications of bundles and local systems. On the one hand, cuspidal
Hecke eigensheaves in the de Rham and Betti sense are expected to coincide, so
that one can view the Betti conjecture as offering a different ""integration
measure"" on the same fundamental objects. On the other hand, the Betti spectral
categories are more explicit than their de Rham counterparts and one might hope
the conjecture is less challenging. The Betti program also enjoys symmetries
coming from topological field theory: it is expected to extend to an
equivalence of four-dimensional topological field theories, and in particular,
the conjecture for closed surfaces is expected to reduce to the case of the
thrice-punctured sphere. Finally, we also present ramified, quantum and
integral variants of the conjecture, and highlight connections to other topics,

charge, spin and orbital, leading to various forms of ordered states through
phase transitions. However, in individual materials, a charge/spin/orbital
ordered state of the lowest temperature is normally uniquely determined in
terms of the lowest-energy state, i.e., the ground state. Here, we summarize
recent results showing that under rapid cooling, this principle does not
necessarily hold, and thus, the cooling rate is a control parameter of the
lowest-temperature state beyond the framework of the thermo-equilibrium phase
diagram. Although the cooling rate utilized in low-temperature experiments is
typically 2*10^-3 - 4*10^-1 K/s, the use of optical/electronic pulses
facilitate rapid cooling, such as 10^2-10^3 K/s. Such an unconventionally high
cooling rate allows some systems to kinetically avoid a first-order phase
transition, resulting in a quenched charge/spin state that differs from the
ground state. We also demonstrate that quenched states can be exploited as a
non-volatile state variable when designing phase-change memory functions. The
present findings suggest that rapid cooling is useful for exploring and
controlling the metastable electronic/magnetic state that is potentially hidden
behind the ground state.

In this paper, we develop a learning algorithm for RLR models. Learning an RLR
model from data consists of two steps: 1- learning the set of formulae to be
used in the model (a.k.a. structure learning) and learning the weight of each
formula (a.k.a. parameter learning). For structure learning, we deploy Schmidt
and Murphy's hierarchical assumption: first we learn a model with simple
formulae, then more complex formulae are added iteratively only if all their
sub-formulae have proven effective in previous learned models. For parameter
learning, we convert the problem into a non-relational learning problem and use
an off-the-shelf logistic regression learning algorithm from Weka, an
open-source machine learning tool, to learn the weights. We also indicate how
hidden features about the individuals can be incorporated into RLR to boost the
learning performance. We compare our learning algorithm to other structure and
parameter learning algorithms in the literature, and compare the performance of
RLR models to standard logistic regression and RDN-Boost on a modified version

hold better information about the tail of the distribution and are considered
as good alternatives for moments especially for heavy tailed distributions
since they can be defined as soon as the distribution has finite expectation.

decoy routing systems, surveillance infrastructure like the NSA's alleged

new approach that a routing capable adversary might take to resisting these
systems: the use of economic pressure to incentivize ISPs to remove them.
Rather than directly attacking the availability of these systems, our attack
inflicts economic losses, in the form of reduced transit revenue, on ISPs that
deploy them, while at the same time incentivizing ISPs that do not.
  We alter and expand upon previous routing around decoys attack of Schuchard
et al., by adjusting the priority given to avoiding TMBs. This reduces or
eliminates the key costs faced by routing capable adversary while maintaining
the effectiveness of the attack. Additionally, we show that since the flow of
traffic on the Internet is directly related to the flow of cash between ISPs, a
routing capable adversary is actually a powerful economic adversary. Our
findings show that by preferentially using routes which are free of TMBs, some
routing capable adversaries can inflict in excess of a billion dollars in

momentum acquisition in the galaxy's halo. In all simulations, cold filamentary
gas accretion to the halo results in ~4 times more specific angular momentum in
cold halo gas ($\lambda_{cold} \gtrsim 0.1$) than in the dark matter halo. At
z>1, this inflow takes the form of inspiraling cold streams that are
co-directional in the halo of the galaxy and are fueled, aligned, and
kinematically connected to filamentary gas infall along the cosmic web. Due to
the qualitative agreement among disparate simulations, we conclude that the
buildup of high angular momentum halo gas and the presence of these inspiraling
cold streams are robust predictions of Lambda Cold Dark Matter galaxy
formation, though the detailed morphology of these streams is significantly
less certain. A growing body of observational evidence suggests that this
process is borne out in the real universe.

the innermost radii; hence they are ideal candidates to investigate the
influence of dark matter on different dynamical aspects of spiral galaxies.
Here, we study the effect of dark matter halo on grand-design, m = 2, spiral
modes in a galactic disk, treated as a collisionless system, by carrying out a
global modal analysis within the WKB approximation. First, we study a
superthin, LSB galaxy UGC 7321 and show that it does not support discrete
global spiral modes when modeled as a disk-alone system or as a disk plus dark
matter system. Even a moderate increase in the stellar central surface density
does not yield any global spiral modes. This naturally explains the observed
lack of strong large-scale spiral structure in LSBs. An earlier work (Ghosh,
Saini & Jog, 2016) where the galactic disk was treated as a fluid system for
simplicity had shown that the dominant halo could not arrest global modes. We
found that this difference arises due to the different dispersion relation used
in the two cases and which plays a crucial role in the search for global spiral
modes. Thus the correct treatment of stars as a collisionless system as done
here results in the suppression of global spiral modes, in agreement with the
observations. We performed a similar modal analysis for the Galaxy, and found
that the dark matter halo has a negligible effect on large-scale spiral
structure.

bounded noise do not translate easily to the case of Poisson noise. Reasons for
this include the signal dependent nature of Poisson noise, and also the fact
that the negative log likelihood (NLL) in case of a Poisson distribution (which
is related to the generalized Kullback-Leibler divergence (GKLD)) is not a
metric and does not obey the triangle inequality. There exist prior theoretical
results in the form of provable error bounds for computationally tractable
estimators for compressed sensing problems under Poisson noise. However, these
results do not apply to realistic compressive systems, which must obey some
crucial constraints such as non-negativity and flux preservation. On the other
hand, there exist provable error bounds for such realistic systems in the
published literature, but they are for estimators that are computationally
intractable. In this paper, we develop error bounds for a computationally
tractable estimator which also applies to realistic compressive systems obeying
the required constraints. Our technique replaces the GKLD, with an information
theoretic metric - namely the square root of the Jensen-Shannon divergence
(JSD), which is related to an approximate, symmetrized version of the Poisson
NLL. We show that this allows for simple proofs of the error bounds. We propose
and prove interesting statistical properties of the square root of JSD and
exploit other known ones. Numerical experiments are performed showing the use
of the technique in signal and image reconstruction from compressed
measurements under Poisson noise. Our technique applies to sparse/ compressible
signals in any orthonormal basis, works with high probability for any randomly
generated non-negative and flux-preserving sensing matrix and is proposes an
estimator whose parameters are purely statistically motivated.

anti-ferro-orbital order, which breaks the translational symmetry of the
crystal. The two-orbital approximation is, however, not consistent with the
Fermi surface geometry of Fe superconductors, as it yields the wrong position
of one of the hole pockets. Here we analyze the model with the same interaction
but with realistic Fermi surface geometry (two hole pockets at the center of
the Brillouin zone and two electron pockets at its boundary). We apply the
parquet renormalization-group (pRG) technique to detect the leading instability
upon the lowering of the temperature. We argue that the pRG analysis strongly
favors a q = 0 orbital order, which in the band basis is a d-wave Pomeranchuk
order.

can directly affect unemployment rates and economic growth. At the individual
level, unemployment often has a detrimental impact on people's well-being and
health. At the national level, high employment is one of the central goals of
any economic policy, due to its close association with national prosperity. The
main goal of this thesis is to highlight the need for frameworks that take into
account the complex structure of labor market interactions. In particular, we
explore the benefits of leveraging tools from computational social science,
network science, and data-driven theories to measure the flow of opportunities
and information in the context of the labor market. First, we investigate our
key hypothesis, which is that opportunity/information flow through weak ties,
and this is a key determinant of the length of unemployment. We then extend the
idea of opportunity/information flow to clusters of other economic activities,
where we expect the flow within clusters of related activities to be higher
than within isolated activities. This captures the intuition that within
related activities there are more ""capitals"" involved and that such activities
require similar ""capabilities."" Therefore, more extensive clusters of economic
activities should generate greater growth through exploiting the greater flow
of opportunities and information. We quantify the opportunity/information flow
using a complexity measure of two economic activities (i.e. jobs and exports).

recognized as a relativistic symmetry in 1990s, there have been comprehensive
efforts to understand its properties in various systems and potentials. In this
Review, we mainly focus on the latest progress on the supersymmetric (SUSY)

shown that the origin of PSS and its symmetry-breaking mechanism, which are

inter-class difference and large intra-class variation. Recently, visual
attention models have been applied to automatically localize the discriminative
regions of an image for better capturing critical difference and demonstrated
promising performance. However, without consideration of the diversity in
attention process, most of existing attention models perform poorly in
classifying fine-grained objects. In this paper, we propose a diversified
visual attention network (DVAN) to address the problems of fine-grained object
classification, which substan- tially relieves the dependency on
strongly-supervised information for learning to localize discriminative regions
compared with attentionless models. More importantly, DVAN explicitly pursues
the diversity of attention and is able to gather discriminative information to
the maximal extent. Multiple attention canvases are generated to extract
convolutional features for attention. An LSTM recurrent unit is employed to
learn the attentiveness and discrimination of attention canvases. The proposed
DVAN has the ability to attend the object from coarse to fine granularity, and
a dynamic internal representation for classification is built up by
incrementally combining the information from different locations and scales of
the image. Extensive experiments con- ducted on CUB-2011, Stanford Dogs and
Stanford Cars datasets have demonstrated that the proposed diversified visual
attention networks achieve competitive performance compared to the state-
of-the-art approaches, without using any prior knowledge, user interaction or
external resource in training or testing.

simulate the behaviour of manufactured and physical systems. Propagation of
uncertainties from the input to a response quantity of interest through such
models may become intractable in cases when a single simulation is time
demanding. Particularly challenging is the reliability analysis of systems
represented by computationally costly models, because of the large number of
model evaluations that are typically required to estimate small probabilities
of failure. In this paper, we demonstrate the potential of a newly emerged
meta-modelling technique known as low-rank tensor approximations to address
this limitation. This technique is especially promising for high-dimensional
problems because: (i) the number of unknowns in the generic functional form of
the meta-model grows only linearly with the input dimension and (ii) such
approximations can be constructed by relying on a series of minimization
problems of small size independent of the input dimension. In example
applications involving finite-element models pertinent to structural mechanics
and heat conduction, low-rank tensor approximations built with polynomial bases
are found to outperform the popular sparse polynomial chaos expansions in the
estimation of tail probabilities when small experimental designs are used. It
should be emphasized that contrary to methods particularly targeted to
reliability analysis, the meta-modelling approach also provides a full
probabilistic description of the model response, which can be used to estimate
any statistical measure of interest.

of light over long distances. However, transmission loss can degrade the signal
strength, adding noise. Heralded noiseless amplification of a quantum signal
can provide a solution by enabling longer direct transmission distances and by
enabling entanglement distillation. The central idea of heralded noiseless
amplification---a conditional modification of the probability distribution over
photon number of an optical quantum state---is suggestive of a parallel with
weak measurement: in a weak measurement, learning partial information about an
observable leads to a conditional back-action of a commensurate size. Here we
experimentally investigate the application of weak, or variable-strength,
measurements to the task of heralded amplification, by using a quantum logic
gate to weakly couple a small single-optical-mode quantum state (the signal) to
an ancilla photon (the meter). The weak measurement is carried out by choosing
the measurement basis of the meter photon and, by conditioning on the meter
outcomes, the signal is amplified. We characterise the gain of the amplifier as
a function of the measurement strength, and use interferometric methods to show
that the operation preserves the coherence of the signal.

attraction between the components and intra-species self-repulsion, which may
be realized in atomic Bose-Einstein condensates, as well as in a
quasi-equilibrium condensate of microcavity polaritons. Including a 2D
spatially periodic potential, which is necessary for the stabilization of the
system against the critical collapse, we use detailed numerical calculations
and an analytical variational approximation (VA) to predict the existence and
stability of several types of 2D symbiotic solitons in the spinor system.
Stability ranges are found for symmetric and asymmetric symbiotic fundamental
solitons and vortices, including hidden-vorticity (HV) modes, with opposite
vorticities in the two components. The VA produces exceptionally accurate
predictions for the fundamental solitons and vortices. The fundamental
solitons, both symmetric and asymmetric ones, are completely stable, in either
case when they exist as gap solitons or regular ones. The symmetric and
asymmetric vortices are stable if the inter-component attraction is stronger
than the intra-species repulsion, while the HV modes have their stability
region in the opposite case.

ultracold atoms. As a fundamental physical process, the MBT is expected to play
important roles in general quantum systems.

below 28 GHz) do not exhibit enough directivity and selectively, as their
counterparts in higher bands of the spectrum (i.e., above 60 GHz), and thus
still suffer from the detrimental effect of interference, on the system
sum-rate. As such systems exhibit large numbers of antennas and short coherence
times for the channel, traditional methods of distributed coordination are
ill-suited, and the resulting communication overhead would offset the gains of
coordination. In this work, we propose algorithms for tackling the sum-rate
maximization problem, that are designed to address the above limitations. We
derive a lower bound on the sum-rate, a so-called DLT bound (i.e., a difference
of log and trace), shed light on its tightness, and highlight its decoupled
nature at both the transmitters and receivers. Moreover, we derive the solution
to each of the subproblems, that we dub non-homogeneous waterfilling (a
variation on the MIMO waterfilling solution), and underline an inherent
desirable feature: its ability to turn-off streams exhibiting low-SINR, and
contribute to greatly speeding up the convergence of the proposed algorithm. We
then show the convergence of the resulting algorithm, max-DLT, to a stationary
point of the DLT bound. Finally, we rely on extensive simulations of various
network configurations, to establish the fast-converging nature of our proposed
schemes, and thus their suitability for addressing the short coherence
interval, as well as the increased system dimensions, arising when managing
interference in lower bands of the millimeter wave spectrum. Moreover, our
results also suggest that interference management still brings about
significant performance gains, especially in dense deployments.

Krylov-based method for solving nonlinear eigenvalue problems (NEPs). This
method can be interpreted as an Arnoldi method applied to a linear and infinite
dimensional eigenvalue problem where the Krylov basis consists of polynomials.
We propose new restart techniques for TIAR and analyze efficiency and
robustness. More precisely, we consider an extension of TIAR which corresponds
to generating the Krylov space using not only polynomials but also structured
functions that are sums of exponentials and polynomials, while maintaining a
memory efficient tensor representation. We propose two restarting strategies,
both derived from the specific structure of the infinite dimensional Arnoldi
factorization. One restarting strategy, which we call semi-explicit TIAR
restart, provides the possibility to carry out locking in a compact way. The
other strategy, which we call implicit TIAR restart, is based on the
Krylov-Schur restart method for linear eigenvalue problem and preserves its
robustness. Both restarting strategies involve approximations of the tensor
structured factorization in order to reduce complexity and required memory
resources. We bound the error in the infinite dimensional Arnoldi factorization
showing that the approximation does not substantially influence the robustness
of the restart approach. We illustrate the approaches by applying them to solve
large scale NEPs that arise from a delay differential equation and a wave
propagation problem. The advantages in comparison to other restart methods are
also illustrated.

this results in nearest-neighbor hopping at low temperatures due to the
formation of a single conduction path, which adjusts in the planes where the
wave functions overlap strongly. In the perpendicular direction, charge

Followers choose productions in the second stage but can sell forward contracts
in the first stage. Our main result is an explicit characterization of the

to long-wavelength one everywhere outside the Galactic disk has been found to
be smaller than that in the disk and, accordingly, the mean dust grain size is
larger, while the grain size distribution in the range 0.5-11 microns is
shifted toward coarse dust. Specifically, the mean grain size initially
increases sharply with distance from the Galactic midplane, then decreases
gradually, approaching a value typical of the disk at $|Z|\approx2.4$ kpc, and,
further out, stabilizes or may increase again. The coefficients under

coinciding every 656\pm20 pc to the south and the north and showing a

periodic structure of the interstellar medium at high latitudes within at least
5 kpc. The same periodic variations have also been found for the extinction
coefficient Rv within 600 pc of the Galactic midplane through the reduction of
different photometric data for stars of different classes.

they experience an additional spin-dependent phase angle which results in spin
mixing and the formation of a bound state called the Andreev Bound State. This
state is an essential component in the generation of long range spin triplet
proximity induced superconductivity and yet the factors controlling the degree
of spin mixing and the formation of the bound state remain elusive. Here we
demonstrate that point contact Andreev reflection can be used to detect the
bound state and extract the resulting spin mixing angle. By examining spectra
taken from La1.15Sr1.85Mn2O7 single crystal - Pb junctions, together with a
compilation of literature data on highly spin polarised systems, we show that
the existence of the Andreev Bound State both resolves a number of long
standing controversies in the Andreev literature as well as defining a route to
quantify the strength of spin mixing at superconductor-ferromagnet interfaces.
Intriguingly we find that for these high transparency junctions, the spin
mixing angle appears to take a relatively narrow range of values across all the
samples studied. The ferromagnets we have chosen to study share a common
property in terms of their spin arrangement, and our observations may point to
the importance of this property in determining the spin mixing angle under

because of the inefficient throughput at red wavelengths resulting in

this transformation is a generalisation of the linear-chiral duality, which is
known to provide a dual description in terms of chiral superfields for general
models of self-interacting N=2 vector multiplets in three dimensions and N=1
tensor multiplets in four dimensions. For superspin-1 (gravitino multiplet),
superspin-3/2 (supergravity multiplet) and higher superspins s>3/2, the duality
transformation relates a higher-derivative theory to one containing at most two
derivatives at the component level. In the N=1 case, we introduce gauge
prepotentials for higher spin superconformal gravity and construct the
corresponding super-Cotton tensors, as well as the higher spin extensions of
the linearised N=1 conformal supergravity action. Our N=1 duality
transformation is a higher spin extension of the known superfield duality
relating the massless N=1 vector and scalar multiplets. In the
non-supersymmetric (N=0) case, the gauge prepotentials for higher spin
conformal geometry (both bosonic and fermionic) and the corresponding Cotton

reduction. In the bosonic sector, this reduction is shown to lead to the Cotton

attributed to the complexity of the free-energy landscapes, similarly to
polymers and glasses. It was found recently that the hydrogen-bond breathing of
terminal DNA base pairs exhibits a slow power-law relaxation attributable to
weak Hamiltonian chaos, with parameters similar to experimental data. Here, the
relationship is studied between this motion and spectroscopic signals measured
in DNA with a small molecular photoprobe inserted into the base-pair stack. To
this end, the earlier computational approach in combination with an analytical
theory is applied to the experimental DNA fragment. It is found that the
intensity of breathing dynamics is strongly increased in the internal base
pairs that flank the photoprobe, with anomalous relaxation quantitatively close
to that in terminal base pairs. A physical mechanism is proposed to explain the
coupling between the relaxation of base-pair breathing and the experimental
response signal. It is concluded that the algebraic relaxation observed
experimentally is very likely a manifestation of weakly chaotic dynamics of
hydrogen-bond breathing in the base pairs stacked to the photoprobe, and that
the weak nanoscale chaos can represent an ubiquitous hidden source of
non-exponential relaxation in ultrafast spectroscopy.

these schemes in the circuit QED architecture, using an artificial atom as the

Different measurement schemes can be realized by preparing the field either in
a superposition of Fock states or in a coherent state and exploiting

  neurophysiological processes","In review, Journal of Neuroscience Methods",,,,"stat.AP","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Granger causality is well established within the neurosciences for inference
of directed functional connectivity from neurophysiological data. These data
usually consist of time series which subsample a continuous-time
biophysiological process. While it is well-known that subsampling can lead to
imputation of spurious causal connections where none exist, here we address the
equally important issue of the effects of subsampling on the ability to
reliably detect causal connections which do exist.
  Neurophysiological processes typically feature signal propagation delays on
multiple time scales; accordingly, we base our analysis on a distributed-lag,
continuous-time stochastic model, and consider Granger causality in continuous
time at finite prediction horizons. Via exact analytical solutions, we identify
relationships among sampling frequency, underlying causal time scales and
detectability of causalities. Our analysis reveals complex interactions between
the time scale(s) of neural signal propagation and sampling frequency: we
demonstrate that Granger causality decays exponentially as the sample time
interval increases beyond causal delay times, identify detectability ""black
spots"" and ""sweet spots"", and show that subsampling may sometimes improve
detectability. We also demonstrate that the invariance of Granger causality
under causal, invertible filtering fails at finite prediction horizons. We
discuss the implications of our results for inference of Granger causality at
the neural level from various neurophysiological recording modes, and emphasise
that sampling rates for causal analysis of neurophysiological time series
should be informed by domain-specific time scales.

networks, where the transmissions of all terminals are required to be scheduled
within a tight deadline. The transmissions thus share a fixed amount of
resources, i.e., symbols, while facing short blocklengths due to the
low-latency requirement. We investigate two distinct relaying strategies,
namely best relay selection among the participating terminals and best antenna
selection at the access point of the network. In both schemes, we incorporate
the cost of acquiring instantaneous Channel State Information (CSI) at the
access point within the transmission deadline. An error probability model is
developed under the finite blocklength regime to provide accurate performance
results. As a reference, this model is compared to the corresponding infinite
bocklength error model. Both analytical models are validated by simulation. We
show that the average Packet Error Rate (PER) over all terminals is convex in
the target error probability at each single link. Moreover, we find that: (i)
The reliability behavior is different for the two strategies, while the
limiting factors are both finite blocklengths and overhead of acquiring CSI.
(ii) With the same order of diversity, best antenna selection is more reliable
than best relay selection. (iii) The average PER is increasing in the number of
participating terminals unless the terminals also act as relay candidates. In
particular, if each participating terminal is a candidate for best relay
selection, the PER is convex in the number of terminals.

strategies as in Rebeschini and Van Handel (2015) (and earlier pioneering work

circumvent this curse of dimensionality. We thus obtain approximate smoothers
that can be computed recursively in time and in parallel in space. First, we
show that the bias of our blocked smoother is bounded uniformly in the time
horizon and in the model dimension. We then approximate the blocked smoother
with particles and derive the asymptotic variance of idealised versions of our
blocked particle smoother to show that variance is no longer adversely effected
by the dimension of the model. Finally, we employ our method to successfully
perform maximum-likelihood estimation via stochastic gradient-ascent and
stochastic expectation--maximisation algorithms in a 100-dimensional

representation of data, such that solving many different tasks becomes easier.
Existing methods typically focus on vectorized data and offer little support
for relational data, which additionally describe relationships among instances.
In this work we introduce an approach for relational unsupervised
representation learning. Viewing a relational dataset as a hypergraph, new
features are obtained by clustering vertices and hyperedges. To find a
representation suited for many relational learning tasks, a wide range of
similarities between relational objects is considered, e.g. feature and
structural similarities. We experimentally evaluate the proposed approach and
show that models learned on such latent representations perform better, have
lower complexity, and outperform the existing approaches on classification
tasks.

challenging and comes at a price: the wanted linear performance is degraded due
to nonlinear effects. To compensate for these nonlinear disturbances, existing
techniques compute the pre-inverse of the power amplifier by estimation of a
nonlinear model. However, the extraction of this nonlinear model is involved
and requires advanced system identification techniques.
  We used the plant inversion iterative learning control algorithm to
investigate whether the nonlinear modeling step can be simplified. This paper
introduces the iterative learning control framework for the pre-inverse
estimation and predistortion of power amplifiers. The iterative learning
control algorithm is used to obtain a high quality predistorted input for the
power amplifier under study without requiring a nonlinear model of the power
amplifier. In a second step a nonlinear pre-inverse model of the amplifier is
obtained. Both the nonlinear and memory effects of a power amplifier can be
compensated by this approach. The convergence of the iterative approach, and
the predistortion results are illustrated on a simulation of a Motorola LDMOS

by using morphological Minkowski tensor analysis of the minority phase domain
growth in a demixing simulated binary complex plasma. These Minkowski tensor
methods are compared with previous results that utilized a power spectrum
method based on the time-dependent average structure factor. It is shown that
the Minkowski tensor methods are superior to the previously used power spectrum
method in the sense of higher sensitivity to changes in domain size. By
analysis of the slope of the temporal evolution of Minkowski tensor measures
qualitative differences between the case of particle interaction with a single
length scale compared to particle interactions with two different length scales
(dominating long range interaction) are revealed. After proper scaling the
graphs for the two length scale scenario coincide, pointing towards universal
behaviour. The qualitative difference in demixing scenarios is evidenced by
distinct demixing behaviour: In the long range dominated cases demixing occurs
in two stages. At first neighbouring particles agglomerate then domains start
to merge in cascades. However in the case of only one interaction length scale
only agglomeration but no merging of domains can be observed. Thus, Minkowski
Tensor analysis are likely to become a useful tool for further investigation of
this (and other) demixing processes. It is capable to reveal (nonlinear) local
topological properties, probing deeper than (linear) global power spectrum
analysis, however still providing easily interpretable results founded on a
solid mathematical framework.

observatory with imaging and multi-object spectroscopy through ESA's NIRspec

  To ensure proper target acquisition, the on-sky position of the MSA needs to
be verified before spectroscopic observations start. An onboard centroiding
program registers the position of pre-identified guide stars in a Target
Acquisition (TA) image, a short pre-spectroscopy exposure without dispersion
(image mode) through the MSA with all shutters open.
  The outstanding issue is the availability of Galactic stars in the right
luminosity range for TA relative to typical high redshift targets. We explore
this here using the stars and $z\sim8$ candidate galaxies identified in the
source extractor catalogs of Brightest of Reionizing Galaxies survey
(BoRG[z8]), a pure-parallel program with Hubble Space Telescope Wide-Field
Camera 3.
  We find that (a) a single WFC3 field contains enough Galactic stars to
satisfy the NIRspec astrometry requirement (20 milli-arcseconds), provided its
and the NIRspec TA's are $m_{lim}>24.5$ AB in WFC3 F125W, (b) a single WFC3

accompanying TA image satisfy the astrometry requirement at $\sim23$ AB mag in
WFC3 F125W, (d) no specific Galactic latitude requires deeper TA imaging due to
a lack of Galactic stars, and (e) a depth of $\sim24$ AB mag in WFC3 F125W is
needed if a guide star in the same MSA quadrant as a target is required.
  We take the example of a BoRG identified $z\sim8$ candidate galaxy and
require a Galactic star within 20"" of it. In this case, a depth of 25.5 AB in
F125W is required (with $\sim$97% confidence).

covariance matrix subject to the budget constraint and the constraint for the

statistical physics of disordered systems. We find that the replica symmetry of
the solution does not need to be assumed, but emerges as the unique solution of
the optimization problem. We also check the stability of this solution and find
that the eigenvalues of the Hessian are positive for $r=N/T<1$, where $N$ is
the dimension of the portfolio and $T$ the length of the time series used to
estimate the covariance matrix. At the critical point $r=1$ a phase transition
is taking place. The out of sample estimation error blows up at this point as
$1/(1-r)$, independently of the covariance matrix or the expected return,
displaying the universality not only of the critical index, but also the
critical point. As a conspicuous illustration of the dangers of in-sample
estimates, the optimal in-sample variance is found to vanish at the critical

insufficient pitch angle coverage of current particle detectors. The Medium
Energy Proton and Electron Detectors (MEPED) instrument on board the NOAA/Polar
Orbiting Environmental Satellites(POES) and MetOp spacecraft has two sets of
electron and proton telescopes pointing close to zenith ($0 ^{\circ}$) and in
the horizontal plane ($90 ^{\circ}$). Using measurements from either the $0
^{\circ}$ or $90 ^{\circ}$ telescope will underestimate or overestimate the
bounce loss cone flux, respectively, as the energetic electron fluxes are often
strongly anisotropic with decreasing fluxes toward the center of the loss cone.
By combining the measurements from both telescopes with electron pitch angle
distributions from theory of wave-particle interactions in the magnetosphere, a
complete bounce loss cone flux is constructed for each of the electron energy
channels >50 keV, >100 keV, and >300 keV. We apply a correction method to
remove proton contamination in the electron counts. We also account for the
relativistic (>1000 keV) electrons contaminating the proton detector at
subauroral latitudes. This gives us full range coverage of electron energies
that will be deposited in the middle atmosphere. Finally, we demonstrate the
method's applicability on strongly anisotropic pitch angle distributions during
a weak geomagnetic storm in February 2008. We compare the electron fluxes and
subsequent energy deposition estimates to OH observations from the Microwave
Limb Sounder on the Aura satellite substantiating that the estimated fluxes are
representative for the true precipitating fluxes impacting the atmosphere.

modulating both the spectral and spatial profile. To access the latter, we vary
the chirp of the fundamental, imparting different phases on the different

with an analytical model, we are able to explain the on-axis behaviour and
access the dipole phase parameters for the short (\(\alpha_s\)) and long

methods. A common practice to deal with it is to create ensembles of
classifiers that learn from resampled balanced data. For example, bagged
decision trees combined with random undersampling (RUS) or the synthetic
minority oversampling technique (SMOTE). However, most of the resampling
methods entail asymmetric changes to the examples of different classes, which
in turn can introduce its own biases in the model. Furthermore, those methods
require a performance measure to be specified a priori before learning. An
alternative is to use a so-called threshold-moving method that a posteriori
changes the decision threshold of a model to counteract the imbalance, thus has
a potential to adapt to the performance measure of interest. Surprisingly,
little attention has been paid to the potential of combining bagging ensemble
with threshold-moving. In this paper, we present probability thresholding
bagging (PT-bagging), a versatile plug-in method that fills this gap. Contrary
to usual rebalancing practice, our method preserves the natural class
distribution of the data resulting in well calibrated posterior probabilities.
We also extend the proposed method to handle multiclass data. The method is
validated on binary and multiclass benchmark data sets. We perform analyses
that provide insights into the proposed method.

We
have proven if without advanced potential, it is not possible to satisfy the

really did that. A important result of the mutual energy theorem is that the
advanced potential can suck energy from the transmitter. This energy is equal
to the energy received at the receiver. Hence a transmitter can not send any
energy out without the receiver. For two remote objects, the energy is
transferred only can by the mutual energy of a retarded potential from the
source together with an advanced potential from the sink. If the sucked energy
is discrete, the summation of mutual energy current of the infinite background
atoms or currents, which can be seen as receivers, is a random process. This
means that the photon energy sent by the transmitter is actually grabbed by the
receiver. Hence the photon from very beginning knows their destination. This
receiver send advanced potential to the transmitter. This explanation also
avoided the wave function collapse. The retarded potential first reached the
receiver, cause the current in the receiver, the current of receiver send a
advanced potential to the transmitter with a reversed time, in the same time, a

of an envelope function is explicitly kept for arbitrary pulse durations.
Therefore, it is capable of describing not only a photo absorption/emission but
also a non-adiabatic transition which is induced by the time-varying envelope
of the pulse. It was shown that the envelope Hamiltonian accurately retrieves
the results obtained by the time-dependent Schr\""odinger equation, and
underlying physics were well understood by the adiabatic approximation based on
the envelope Hamiltonian. In this paper, we further explore two more aspects of
the detachment dynamics, which were not done in our previous work. First, we
find out features of both a {\it spatial} and {\it temporal} interference of
photo electron wave packets in a photo absorption process. We conclude that
both the interference mechanisms are universal in ionization dynamics in
high-frequency regime. To our knowledge, it is first time that both the
interference mechanisms in high-frequency regime are extracted from the first
principle. Second, we extract a pulse duration which maximize a yield of the
non-adiabatic transition as a function of a pulse duration. It is shown that it
becomes maximum when the pulse duration is comparable to a time-scale of an

the fast motion of the particle comes at the expense of the energy cost. The

  distributions","41 pages, 12 figures",,,,"q-bio.NC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Estimating causal interactions in the brain from functional magnetic
resonance imaging (fMRI) data remains a challenging task. Multiple studies have
demonstrated that all current approaches to determine direction of connectivity
perform poorly even when applied to synthetic fMRI datasets. Recent advances in
this field include methods for pairwise inference, which involve creating a
sparse connectome in the first step, and then using a classifier in order to
determine the directionality of connection between of every pair of nodes in
the second step. In this work, we introduce an advance to the second step of
this procedure, by building a classifier based on fractional moments of the
BOLD distribution combined into cumulants. The classifier is trained on
datasets generated under the Dynamic Causal Modeling (DCM) generative model.
The directionality is inferred based upon statistical dependencies between the
two node time series, e.g. assigning a causal link from time series of low
variance to time series of high variance. Our approach outperforms or performs
as well as other methods for effective connectivity when applied to the
benchmark datasets. Crucially, it is also more resilient to confounding effects
such as differential noise level across different areas of the connectome.

determine the response time of the ferromagnetic system. Today, our current

in the outer Galactic disk that was not considered by Zasowski et al., this

that in the solar neighborhood. This general Galactic trend seems to be
explained by the influence of the spiral pattern: its processes sort the dust
by size and fragment it so that coarse and fine dust tend to accumulate,
respectively, at the outer and inner (relative to the Galactic center) edges of
the spiral arms. As a result, fine dust may exist only in the part of the
Galactic disk far from both the Galactic center and the edge, while coarse dust
dominates at the Galactic center, at the disk edge, and outside the disk.

of accreting white dwarfs in binary systems. The material piles up under
degenerate conditions, driving a thermonuclear runaway. The energy released by
the suite of nuclear processes operating at the envelope heats the material up
to peak temperatures about 100 - 400 MK. During these events, about 10-3 - 10-7
Msun, enriched in CNO and, sometimes, other intermediate-mass elements (e.g.,
Ne, Na, Mg, Al) are ejected into the interstellar medium. To account for the
gross observational properties of classical novae (in particular, the large
concentrations of metals spectroscopically inferred in the ejecta), models
require mixing between the (solar-like) material transferred from the secondary
and the outermost layers (CO- or ONe-rich) of the underlying white dwarf.
Recent multidimensional simulations have demonstrated that Kelvin-Helmholtz
instabilities can naturally produce self-enrichment of the accreted envelope
with material from the underlying white dwarf at levels that agree with
observations. However, the feasibility of this mechanism has been explored in
the framework of CO white dwarfs, while mixing with different substrates still
needs to be properly addressed. Three-dimensional simulations of mixing at the
core-envelope interface during nova outbursts have been performed with the
multidimensional code FLASH, for two types of substrates: CO- and ONe-rich. We
show that the presence of an ONe-rich substrate, as in ""neon novae"", yields
larger metallicity enhancements in the ejecta, compared to CO,rich substrates
(i.e., non-neon novae). A number of requirements and constraints for such 3-D
simulations (e.g., minimum resolution, size of the computational domain) are
also outlined.

finite transmission even when the energy falls within the \textit{bulk} band
gap in the central segment respectively. These features are not evident in

nonlinear, since it depends on a shock detector. The same shock detector is
used to gradually lump the mass matrix. The resulting method is LED, positivity
preserving, linearity preserving, and also satisfies a global DMP. Lipschitz
continuity has also been proved. However, the resulting scheme is highly
nonlinear, leading to very poor nonlinear convergence rates. We propose a
smooth version of the scheme, which leads to twice differentiable nonlinear
stabilization schemes. It allows one to straightforwardly use Newton's method
and obtain quadratic convergence. In the numerical experiments, steady and
transient linear transport, and transient Burgers' equation have been
considered in 2D. Using the Newton method with a smooth version of the scheme
we can reduce 10 to 20 times the number of iterations of Anderson acceleration
with the original non-smooth scheme. In any case, these properties are only
true for the converged solution, but not for iterates. In this sense, we have
also proposed the concept of projected nonlinear solvers, where a projection
step is performed at the end of every nonlinear iteration onto a FE space of
admissible solutions. The space of admissible solutions is the one that
satisfies the desired monotonic properties (maximum principle or positivity).

Large dynamical ranges both in halo mass and cosmic time are considered. The

well as the radial distribution of galaxies in clusters into account using a
non-parametric formalism and relies on Bayesian inference to take photometric
redshift uncertainties into account. We successfully test the method against
1,208 galaxy clusters within redshifts $z=0.05-2.58$ and masses
$10^{13.29-14.80}~M_\odot$ drawn from wide field simulated galaxy mock catalogs
developed for the Euclid mission. Median purity $(55^{+17}_{-15})\%$ and
completeness $(95^{+5}_{-10})\%$ are reached for galaxies brighter than
0.25$L_\ast$ within $r_{200}$ of each simulated halo and for a statistical
photometric redshift accuracy $\sigma((z_s-z_p)/(1+z_s))=0.03$. The mean values
$p=56\%$ and $c=93\%$ have sub-percent uncertainties. Accurate photometric
redshifts ($\sigma((z_s-z_p)/(1+z_s))\lesssim0.05$) and robust estimates for
the cluster redshift and the center coordinates are required. The method is
applied to derive accurate richness estimates. A statistical comparison between
the true ($N_{\rm true}$) vs estimated richness ($\lambda=\sum P_{mem}$) yields
on average to unbiased results, $Log(\lambda/N_{\rm true})=-0.0051\pm0.15$. The
scatter around the mean of the logarithmic difference between $\lambda$ and the
halo mass is 0.10~dex, for massive halos $\gtrsim10^{14.5}~M_\odot$. Our
estimates could be useful to calibrate independent cluster mass estimates from
weak lensing, SZ, and X-ray studies. Our method can be applied to any list of
galaxy clusters or groups in both present and forthcoming surveys such as SDSS,
CFHTLS, DES, LSST, and Euclid.

due to the accumulation of elementary events, consisting of spacially and

Recently, numerical and experimental work addressed the issue of
spatio-temporal correlations between these plastic events. Here, we provide
further insight into these correlations by investigating, via molecular
dynamics (MD) simulations, the plastic response of a two-dimensional amorphous
solid to artificially triggered local shear transformations. We show that while
the plastic response is virtually absent in as-quenched configurations, it
becomes apparent if a shear strain was previously imposed on the system.
Plastic response has a four-fold symmetry which is characteristic of the shear
stress redistribution following the local transformation. At high shear rate we
report evidence for a fluctuation-dissipation relation, connecting plastic
response and correlation, which seems to break down if lower shear rates are
considered.

southwestern limb is interacting with a dense ambient cloud, thus being a
promising region for gamma-ray hadronic emission. We aim at describing the
physics and the nonthermal emission associated with the shock-cloud interaction
to derive the physical parameters of the cloud (poorly constrained by the data
analysis), to ascertain the origin of the observed spatial variations in the
spectral properties of the X-ray synchrotron emission, and to predict spectral
and morphological features of the resulting gamma-ray emission. We performed
3-D magnetohydrodynamic simulations modeling the evolution of SN 1006 and its
interaction with the ambient cloud, and explored different model setups. By
applying the REMLIGHT code on the model results, we synthesized the synchrotron
X-ray emission, and compared it with actual observations, to constrain the
parameters of the model. We also synthesized the leptonic and hadronic
gamma-ray emission from the models, deriving constraints on the energy content
of the hadrons accelerated at the southwestern limb. We found that the impact
of the SN 1006 shock front with a uniform cloud with density 0.5 cm^-3 can
explain the observed morphology, the azimuthal variations of the cutoff
frequency of the X-ray synchrotron emission, and the shock proper motion in the

hadronic energy in the southwestern limb is 2.5e49 erg.

system having the magnetic and electric fields on the boundary as inputs and
outputs. Suitable expressions for the energy stored in the region and the
energy absorbed from the boundaries are introduced, and used to show that the
FDTD system is dissipative under a generalized Courant-Friedrichs-Lewy
condition. Based on the concept of dissipation, a powerful theoretical
framework to investigate the stability of FDTD methods is devised. The new
method makes FDTD stability proofs simpler, more intuitive, and modular.
Stability conditions can indeed be given on the individual components (e.g.
boundary conditions, meshes, embedded models) instead of the whole coupled
setup. As an example of application, we derive a new subgridding method with
material traverse, arbitrary grid refinement, and guaranteed stability. The
method is easy to implement and has a straightforward stability proof.

narrow line value ($\sim3\times10^{-9}$ versus $\sim2\times10^{-11}$). The
detected methanol line shows a linewidth similar to those of the broad
p-H$_2$CO lines, which indicates their coexistence. The CO isotopologue data
suggest that the CO depletion factor decreases from $\sim27\pm2$ towards the
core centre to a value of $\sim8\pm1$ towards the core edge. In the latter
position, the N$_2$D$^+$/N$_2$H$^+$ ratio is revised down to $0.14\pm0.06$. The
origin of the subfragments inside the SMM3 core we found previously can be
understood in terms of the Jeans instability if non-thermal motions are taken
into account. The estimated fragmentation timescale, and the derived chemical
abundances suggest that SMM3 is a few times $10^5$ yr old, in good agreement
with its Class 0 classification inferred from the spectral energy distribution
analysis. The broad p-H$_2$CO and CH$_3$OH lines, and the associated warm gas
provide the first clear evidence of a molecular outflow driven by SMM3.

unprecedented new heights. As one derivative of Moore's law, the operating
system evolves from the initial 16 bits, 32 bits, to the ultimate 64 bits. Most
modern computing platforms are in transition to the 64-bit versions. For
upcoming decades, IT industry will inevitably favor software and systems, which
can efficiently utilize the new 64-bit hardware resources. In particular, with
the advent of massive data outputs regularly, memory-efficient software and
systems would be leading the future.
  In this paper, we aim at studying practical Walsh-Hadamard Transform (WHT).
WHT is popular in a variety of applications in image and video coding, speech
processing, data compression, digital logic design, communications, just to
name a few. The power and simplicity of WHT has stimulated research efforts and
interests in (noisy) sparse WHT within interdisciplinary areas including (but
is not limited to) signal processing, cryptography. Loosely speaking, sparse
WHT refers to the case that the number of nonzero Walsh coefficients is much
smaller than the dimension; the noisy version of sparse WHT refers to the case
that the number of large Walsh coefficients is much smaller than the dimension
while there exists a large number of small nonzero Walsh coefficients. Clearly,
general Walsh-Hadamard Transform is a first solution to the noisy sparse WHT,
which can obtain all Walsh coefficients larger than a given threshold and the
index positions. In this work, we study efficient implementations of very large
dimensional general WHT. Our work is believed to shed light on noisy sparse
WHT, which remains to be a big open challenge. Meanwhile, the main idea behind
will help to study parallel data-intensive computing, which has a broad range
of applications.

sighting in more depth. We searched for additional evidences from other areas
like East Asia and Europe. We found that the date given by al-Yamani is fully
consistent with other evidence, including: (a) SN 1006 ""rose several times half
an hour after sunset"" (al-Yamani), which is correct for the location of Sana in
Yemen for the time around Apr 17, but it would not be correct for late Apr or
early May; (b) the date (3rd year, 3rd lunar month, 28th day wuzi, Ichidai
Yoki) for an observation of a guest star in Japan is inconsistent (there is no
day wuzi in that lunar month), but may be dated to Apr 16 by reading wuwu date
rather than a wuzi date; (c) there is observational evidence that SN 1006 was
observed in East Asia early or mid April; for the second half of April, a bad
weather (early monsoon) period is not unlikely -- there is a lack of night
reports; (d) the observer in St. Gallen reported to have seen SN 1006 ""for
three months"", which must have ended at the very latest on AD 1006 Jul 10,
given his northern location, so that his observations probably started in
April. We conclude that the correctly reported details give quite high
confidence in the fully self-consistent report of al-Yamani, so that the early
discovery date should be considered seriously.

good performance in signal reconstruction. However, the existing PSWFs based
reconstruction methods only consider the mean square error (MSE) criterion as
the cost functions. The MSE criterion is sensitive to the non-Gaussian noise,
since it is builded up by the Gaussian assumption. Therefore, for the impulsive
noise or outliers, the MSE based reconstruction methods will lead to the large
reconstruction error. The proposed MCC and PSWFs based robust signal
