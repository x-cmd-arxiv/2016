below the Coulomb barrier have pointed out questions of the alpha-particle
optical-model potential (OMP) which are yet open within various mass ranges.
Purpose: The applicability of a previous optical potential and eventual
uncertainties and/or systematic errors of the OMP assessment at low energies
can be further considered on this basis. Method: Nuclear model parameters based
on the analysis of recent independent data, particularly gamma-ray strength
functions, have been involved within statistical model calculation of the
(alpha,x) reaction cross sections. Results: The above-mentioned potential
provides a consistent description of the recent alpha-induced reaction data
with no empirical rescaling factors of the and/or nucleon widths. Conclusions:
A suitable assessment of alpha-particle optical potential below the Coulomb
barrier should involve the statistical-model parameters beyond this potential
on the basis of a former analysis of independent data.

potential device applications. So far, the vast majority of research efforts
have focused on the low-energy (0001) surfaces, which correspond to natural
cleavage planes in these layered materials. However, the surfaces of
low-dimensional nanostructures (nanoplatelets, nanowires, nanoribbons)
inevitably involve higher-index facets. We perform a systematic ab initio

characterized by different crystallographic orientations, atomic structures and
stoichiometric compositions. We find several stable terminations of high-index

of one of constituent elements. For the uniquely defined stoichiometric
termination, the topological Dirac fermion states are shown to be strongly
anisotropic with a clear dependence of Fermi velocities and spin polarization
on the surface orientation. Self-doping effects and the presence of
topologically trivial mid-gap states are found to characterize the
non-stoichiometric surfaces. The results of our study pave the way towards
experimental control of topologically protected surface states in bismuth

with Coulomb interactions and Fermi statistics. We propose a procedure for
finding special twist values which, at variance with previous applications of
this method, reproduce the energy of the mean-field infinite-size limit
solution within an adjustable (arbitrarily small) numerical error. This choice
of the special twist is shown to be the most accurate single-twist solution for
curing one-body finite-size effects in correlated calculations. For these
reasons we dubbed our procedure ""exact special twist"" (EST). EST only needs a
fully converged independent-particles or mean-field calculation within the
primitive cell and a simple fit to find the special twist along a specific
direction in the Brillouin zone. We first assess the performances of EST in a
simple correlated model such as the 3D electron gas. Afterwards, we test its
efficiency within $\textit{ab initio}$ quantum Monte Carlo simulations of
metallic elements of increasing complexity. We show that EST displays an
overall good performance in reducing finite-size errors comparable to the
widely used twist average technique but at a much lower computational cost,
since it involves the evaluation of just one wavefunction. We also demonstrate
that the EST method shows similar performances in the calculation of
correlation functions, such as the ionic forces for structural relaxation and
the pair radial distribution function in liquid hydrogen. Our conclusions point
to the usefulness of EST for correlated supercell calculations, our method will
be particularly relevant when the physical problem under consideration requires

conventional $\chi^{2}$ statistic is used to fit all relevant fundamental

untwisted to two copies. We start with a single oscillator excitation on the

simple approximate expressions for the Bogoliubov coefficients and the behavior
of the single oscillator excitation in the continuum limit, where the mode

Considering that gyrochronology relations are widely used today to estimate

it is crucial to assess if these procedures are acceptable. We analyze the
rotational velocities -- limited by the unknown rotation axis inclination angle
-- of an unprecedented large sample of solar twins in order to study the
rotational evolution of Sun-like stars, and assess if the Sun is a typical
rotator. We use high-resolution ($R = 115000$) spectra obtained with the HARPS
spectrograph and ESO's 3.6 m telescope at La Silla Observatory. The projected
rotational velocities for 82 solar twins are estimated by line profile fitting
with synthetic spectra. Macroturbulence velocities are inferred from a
prescription that accurately reflects their dependence with effective
temperature and luminosity of the stars. Our sample of solar twins include some
spectroscopic binaries with enhanced rotational velocities, and we do not find
any non-spectroscopic binaries with unusually high rotation velocities. We
verified that the Sun does not have a peculiar rotation, but the solar twins
exhibit rotational velocities that depart from the Skumanich relation. The Sun
is a regular rotator when compared to solar twins with a similar age.
Additionally, we obtain a rotational braking law that better describes the
stars in our sample ($v \propto t^{-0.6}$) in contrast to previous, often-used

pairs form a valley in the $T-\mu_B$ plane along a line of nearly constant

that the ideal point-particle HRG values are not unique. The wide range of the

a dominant contribution from heavy neutrino exchange. In a small part of the

properties of the heavy neutrinos are consistent with all other experimental
constraints and the observed baryon asymmetry is reproduced. This implies that

the existing K-tier Poisson Point Process (PPP) HetNet model by considering
user locations as Poisson Cluster Process (PCP) with the BSs at the cluster
centers. In particular, we provide the formal analysis of the downlink coverage

derived. Our results demonstrate that the coverage probability decreases as the
size of user clusters around BSs increases, ultimately collapsing to the result
obtained under the assumption of PPP distribution of users independent of the

to the problem of inversion of both minimum and non-minimum phase systems as
well as systems having transmission zeros on the unit circle. Second, the
feedback structure makes the proposed scheme robust to noise. We have shown
that the proposed inversion filter is unbiased for certain categories of
faults. Finally, we have illustrated the performance of our proposed
methodologies through numerous simulation studies.

carried out for different values of the impact velocity and impact angle as

that for the range of impact velocities corresponding to those in the asteroid

that if the activation of MBCs is due to the sublimation of sub-surface
water-ice, this ice has to exist no deeper than a few meters from the surface.
Results also show that ice-exposure occurs in the bottom and on the interior
surface of impact craters as well as the surface of the target where some of
the ejected icy inclusions are re-accreted. While our results demonstrate that
the impact scenario is indeed a viable mechanism to expose ice and trigger the
activity of MBCs, they also indicate that the activity of the current MBCs is
likely due to ice sublimation from multiple impact sites and/or the water

larger than the 5% that is traditionally considered in models of terrestrial
planet formation providing more ice for sublimation. We present details of our

nanosecond time-resolved infrared emission spectroscopy was used to monitor the

The signal-to-noise of all time-resolved spectra were enhanced using the
recently developed algorithm, spectral reconstruction analysis, which allowed
observation of previously obscured minor resonances, and revealed new
dissociation channels producing HCN and HNC. Spectral fit analysis of the
nascent HCN and electronically excited CN($A^2\Pi_1$) resonances yield a lower

Multi-configuration self-consistent field calculations were used to interrogate
the ground and four lowest energy singlet excited states of MCF. At 193 nm,
dissociation is predicted to occur predominantly on the repulsive S$_2$ state.
Nevertheless, minor pathways leading to the production of highly excited ground
state MCF are available via cascading internal conversion from nascent S$_2$
population. An automated transition-state search algorithm was employed to
identify the corresponding ground state dissociation channels, and
Rice-Ramsperger-Kassel-Marcus and Kinetic Monte Carlo kinetic simulations were
used to calculate the associated branching ratios. The proposed mechanism was
validated by direct comparison of the experimentally measured and
quasi-classical trajectory deduced nascent internal energy distribution of HCN,
which were found to be in near perfect agreement. The propensity for cyano
containing hydrocarbons to act as photolytic sources for ro-vibrationally
excited HCN and HNC, as well as their significance to astrophysical

were detected around mature Sun-like stars, their existence has not yet been
firmly demonstrated for young stars, whose magnetic activity is so intense that
it overshadows the radial velocity signal that close-in giant planets can
induce. Here we show that hot Jupiters around young stars can be revealed from
extended sets of high-resolution spectra. Once filtered-out from the activity,
radial velocities of V830 Tau derived from new data collected in late 2015
exhibit a sine wave of period 4.93 d and semi-amplitude 75 m/ s, detected with
a false alarm probability <0.03%. We find that this signal is fully unrelated

regret}$ property experience fast convergence to approximate optimality in a
large class of repeated games. Our property, which simply requires that each
learner has small regret compared to a $(1+\epsilon)$-multiplicative
approximation to the best action in hindsight, is ubiquitous among learning
algorithms; it is satisfied even by the vanilla Hedge forecaster. Our results
improve upon recent work of Syrgkanis et al. [SALS15] in a number of ways. We
require only that players observe payoffs under other players' realized
actions, as opposed to expected payoffs. We further show that convergence
occurs with high probability, and show convergence under bandit feedback.
Finally, we improve upon the speed of convergence by a factor of $n$, the
number of players. Both the scope of settings and the class of algorithms for
which our analysis provides fast convergence are considerably broader than in
previous work.
  Our framework applies to dynamic population games via a low approximate
regret property for shifting experts. Here we strengthen the results of
Lykouris et al. [LST16] in two ways: We allow players to select learning
algorithms from a larger class, which includes a minor variant of the basic
Hedge algorithm, and we increase the maximum churn in players for which
approximate optimality is achieved.
  In the bandit setting we present a new algorithm which provides a ""small
loss""-type bound with improved dependence on the number of actions in utility
settings, and is both simple and efficient. This result may be of independent
interest.

quality of samples from some target distribution? We assume that the samples

Most current evaluation approaches focus on two questions: (1) Has the chain
mixed, that is, is it sampling from the distribution? and (2) How independent
are the samples (as MCMC procedures produce correlated samples)? Focusing on
the case of Bayesian nonnegative matrix factorization, we empirically evaluate
standard metrics of sampler quality as well as propose new metrics to capture
aspects that these measures fail to expose. The aspect of sampling that is of
particular interest to us is the ability (or inability) of sampling methods to
move between multiple optima in NMF problems. As a proxy, we propose and study
a number of metrics that might quantify the diversity of a set of NMF
factorizations obtained by a sampler through quantifying the coverage of the

in this paper is composed of 96 galaxies observed with ALMA at 890um (180um

detected 32% of the sample at more than 3 sigma significance. Using the stacked
ALMA and Herschel photometry, we derived an average dust temperature of 40+/-2
K for the whole sample, and extrapolate the Lir and SFR for all our galaxies
based on their ALMA flux. We then used a forward modeling approach to estimate
their intrinsic sSFR distribution, deconvolved of measurement errors and
selection effects: we find a linear relation between SFR and M*, with a median
sSFR=2.8+/-0.8 Gyr and a dispersion around that relation of 0.28+/-0.13 dex.
This latter value is consistent with that measured at lower redshifts, which is
proof that the main sequence of star-forming galaxies was already in place at
z=4, at least among massive galaxies. These new constraints on the properties
of the main sequence are in good agreement with the latest predictions from
numerical simulations, and suggest that the bulk of star formation in galaxies
is driven by the same mechanism from z=4 to the present day, that is, over at
least 90% of the cosmic history. We also discuss the consequences of our
results on the population of early quiescent galaxies. This paper is part of a

of the proximity operator of the nonsmooth one --- achieves superlinear
convergence rates under mild assumptions at the limit point when the linesearch
directions satisfy a Dennis-Mor\'e condition, and we show that this is the case
for quasi-Newton directions. Our approach is based on the forward-backward

original cost. Extending previous results we show that, despite being nonsmooth

second-order properties which are key for the convergence results of ZeroFPR.
Our theoretical results are backed up by promising numerical simulations. On

secondary user often has limited sensing capabilities only. One key insight is
that channel recommendation among secondary users can help to take advantage of
the inherent correlation structure of spectrum availability in both time and
space, and enable users to obtain more informed spectrum opportunities. With
this insight, we advocate to leverage the wisdom of crowds, and devise social
recommendation aided DSA mechanisms to orient secondary users to make more
intelligent spectrum access decisions, for both strong and weak network
information cases. We start with the strong network information case where
secondary users have the statistical information. To mitigate the difficulty
due to the curse of dimensionality in the stochastic game approach, we take the
one-step Nash approach and cast the social recommendation aided DSA decision
making problem at each time slot as a strategic game. We show that it is a
potential game, and then devise an algorithm to achieve the Nash equilibrium by
exploiting its finite improvement property. For the weak information case where
secondary users do not have the statistical information, we develop a
distributed reinforcement learning mechanism for social recommendation aided
DSA based on the local observations of secondary users only. Appealing to the
maximum-norm contraction mapping, we also derive the conditions under which the
distributed mechanism converges and characterize the equilibrium therein.
Numerical results reveal that the proposed social recommendation aided DSA
mechanisms can achieve superior performance using real social data traces and
its performance loss in the weak network information case is insignificant,
compared with the strong network information case.

the language of Goldstone phenomenon. They represent the pseudo-Goldstone
bosons of certain supertranslations, called A-transformations, that are
spontaneously broken by the black hole metric. This breaking gives rise to a
tower of Goldstone bosons created by the spontaneously-broken generators that
can be labeled by spherical harmonics. Classically, the number of charges is
infinite, they have vanishing VEVs and the corresponding Goldstone modes are
gapless. The resulting hair and entropy are infinite, but unresolvable. In
quantum theory the two things happen. The number of legitimate Goldstone modes
restricted by requirement of weak-coupling, becomes finite and scales as black
hole area in Planck units. The Goldstones generate a tiny gap, controlled by
their gravitational coupling. The gap turns out to be equal to the inverse of
black hole half-life, $t_{BH}$. Correspondingly, in quantum theory the charges
are neither conserved nor vanish, but non-conservation time is set by $t_{BH}$.
This picture nicely matches with the idea of a black hole as of critical system
composed of many soft gravitons. The A-Goldstones of geometric picture
represent the near-gapless Bogoliubov-Goldstone modes of critical soft-graviton
system.

induced $(k+1)K_2$. Alekseev proved that $i(G)$ is at most the number of
induced matchings of $G$.
  This work generalises the aforementioned results to clutters. The right
substructures in this setting are minors rather than induced subgraphs. Maximal
independent sets of a clutter $\mathcal{H}$ are in one-to-one correspondence to
the sets of its blocker, $b(\mathcal{H})$, hence $i(\mathcal{H}) =
|b(\mathcal{H})|$. We show that
  \[
  |b(\mathcal{H})| \le
  \sum_{m=0}^{k \cdot f(r)}{|\mathcal{H}| \choose m} {r \choose 2}^m
  \] for a $(k+1)K_2$-minor-free clutter $\mathcal{H}$ where $f(r) =
(2r-3)2^{r-2}$ and $r$ is the maximum size of a set in $\mathcal{H}$. A key
step in the proofs is, similarly to Alekseev's result, showing that
$i(\mathcal{H})$ is bounded by the number of a substructure called
semi-matching, and then proving a dependence between the number of
semi-matchings and the number of minor matchings. Note that similarly to
graphs, a clutter containing a $kK_2$ minor has at least $2^k$ maximal
independent sets.
  From a computational perspective, a polynomial number of independent sets is
particularly interesting. Our results lead to polynomial algorithms for
restricted instances of many problems including Set Cover and k-SAT.

tests the Schr\""{o}dinger equation with $N$ Dirac delta functions located at
the centers of the Gaussian functions reducing the scaling of potential energy

efficiently and quantitatively describing nonadiabatic population transfer and
intra-surface quantum coherence. We investigate three model systems; the
photodissociation of three coupled Morse oscillators, the bound state dynamics
of two coupled Morse oscillators, and a two-dimensional model for collinear
triatomic vibrational dynamics. In all cases, the pseudospectral Gaussian
method is in quantitative agreement with numerically exact calculations. The
results are promising for nonadiabatic molecular dynamics in molecular systems

is routinely observed in gas-rich galaxies together with large-scale AGN-driven
winds. It is crucial to understand how photons emitted by the central AGN
source couple to the ambient interstellar-medium to trigger large-scale
outflows. By means of radiation-hydrodynamical simulations of idealised
galactic discs, we study the coupling of photons with the multiphase galactic
gas, and how it varies with gas cloud sizes, and the radiation bands included
in the simulations, which are ultraviolet (UV), optical, and infrared (IR). We
show how a quasar with a luminosity of $10^{46}$ erg/s can drive large-scale
winds with velocities of $10^2-10^3$ km/s and mass outflow rates around $10^3$
M$_\odot$/yr for times of order a few million years. Infrared radiation is
necessary to efficiently transfer momentum to the gas via multi-scattering on
dust in dense clouds. However, IR multi-scattering, despite being extremely
important at early times, quickly declines as the central gas cloud expands and
breaks up, allowing the radiation to escape through low gas density channels.
The typical number of multi-scattering events for an IR photon is only about a
quarter of the mean optical depth from the center of the cloud. Our models
account for the observed outflow rates of $\sim$500-1000 M$_\odot$/yr and high
velocities of $\sim 10^3$ km/s, favouring winds that are energy-driven via
extremely fast nuclear outflows, interpreted here as being
IR-radiatively-driven winds.

how the HI content of present-day galaxies depends on their environment. We
show that EAGLE reproduces observed HI mass-environment trends very well, while
semi-analytic models typically overpredict the average HI masses in dense
environments. The environmental processes act primarily as an on/off switch for
the HI content of satellites with stellar mass Mstar>10^9 Msun. At a fixed
Mstar, the fraction of HI-depleted satellites increases with increasing host
halo mass M200 in response to stronger environmental effects, while at a fixed
M200 it decreases with increasing satellite Mstar as the gas is confined by
deeper gravitational potentials. HI-depleted satellites reside mostly, but not
exclusively, within the virial radius r200 of their host halo. We investigate
the origin of these trends by focussing on three environmental mechanisms: ram
pressure stripping by the intra-group medium, tidal stripping by the host halo,
and satellite-satellite encounters. By tracking back in time the evolution of
the HI-depleted satellites, we find that the most common cause of HI removal is
satellite encounters. The timescale for HI removal is typically less than 0.5
Gyr. Tidal stripping occurs in halos of M200<10^{14} Msun within half r200,
while the other processes act also in more massive halos, generally within
r200. Conversely, we find that ram pressure stripping is the most common
mechanism that disturbs the HI morphology of galaxies at redshift z=0. This

by narrow, dense, cold streams. These streams penetrate supersonically through
the hot medium encompassed by a stable shock near the virial radius of the
dark-matter halo. Our long-term goal is to explore the heating and dissipation
rate of the streams and their fragmentation and possible breakup, in order to
understand how galaxies are fed, and how this affects their star-formation rate
and morphology. We present here the first step, where we analyze the linear
Kelvin-Helmholtz instability (KHI) of a cold, dense slab or cylinder flowing
through a hot, dilute medium in the transonic regime. The current analysis is
limited to the adiabatic case with no gravity and assuming equal pressure in
the stream and the medium. By analytically solving the linear dispersion
relation, we find a transition from a dominance of the familiar rapidly growing
surface modes in the subsonic regime to more slowly growing body modes in the
supersonic regime. The system is parameterized by three parameters: the density
contrast between the stream and the medium, the Mach number of stream velocity
with respect to the medium, and the stream width with respect to the halo
virial radius. We find that a realistic choice for these parameters places the
streams near the mode transition, with the KHI exponential-growth time in the
range 0.01-10 virial crossing times for a perturbation wavelength comparable to
the stream width. We confirm our analytic predictions with idealized
hydrodynamical simulations. Our linear-KHI estimates thus indicate that KHI may
in principle be effective in the evolution of streams by the time they reach
the galaxy. More definite conclusions await the extension of the analysis to
the nonlinear regime and the inclusion of cooling, thermal conduction, the halo
potential well, self-gravity and magnetic fields.

that photons are coherently scattered, and so benefit from a substantial
suppression of detrimental interactions between the source and its surrounding

incomplete, as phonon interactions continue to play a crucial role in
determining solid-state emission characteristics even for very weak excitation.
We find that the sideband resulting from non-Markovian relaxation of the phonon
environment is excitation strength independent. It thus leads to an intrinsic

two-photon coalescence at weak driving, both of which are absent for atomic

Since color information occupies a large proportion of the total storage size
of an image, a method that can predict accurate color from its grayscale
version can produce dramatic reduction in image file size. But colorization for
compression poses several challenges. First, while colorization for artistic
purposes simply involves predicting plausible chroma, colorization for
compression requires generating output colors that are as close as possible to
the ground truth. Second, many objects in the real world exhibit multiple
possible colors. Thus, to disambiguate the colorization problem some additional
information must be stored to reproduce the true colors with good accuracy. To
account for the multimodal color distribution of objects we propose a deep
tree-structured network that generates multiple color hypotheses for every
pixel from a grayscale picture (as opposed to a single color produced by most
prior colorization approaches). We show how to leverage the multimodal output
of our model to reproduce with high fidelity the true colors of an image by
storing very little additional information. In the experiments we show that our
proposed method outperforms traditional JPEG color coding by a large margin,
producing colors that are nearly indistinguishable from the ground truth at the
storage cost of just a few hundred bytes for high-resolution pictures!

i) two uniform localization lemmas providing, given $T\geq1$ and a maximizing
sequence of controls, another sequence of controls which is bounded in
$L^{\infty}\left(\left[0,T\right]\right)$ and still maximizing. ii) A special
diagonal procedure dealing with sequences which are not extracted one from the

sources) are created when we calibrate with an incomplete model. In the first
two papers of this series we developed a mathematical framework which enabled
us to study the ghosting mechanism itself. An interesting concomitant of the
second paper was that ghosts appear in symmetrical pairs. This could possibly
account for spurious symmetrization. Spurious symmetrization refers to the
appearance of a spurious source (the anti-ghost) symmetrically opposite an
unmodelled source around a modelled source. The analysis in the first two
papers indicates that the anti-ghost is usually very faint, in particular when
a large number of antennas are used. This suggests that spurious symmetrization
will mainly occur at an almost undetectable flux level. In this paper, we show
that phase-only calibration produces an anti-ghost that is $N$-times (where $N$
denotes the number of antennas in the array) as bright as the one produced by
phase and amplitude calibration and that this already bright ghost can be
further amplified by the primary beam correction.

large-scale studies relating individual-level mobility patterns to a wide
variety of patient-centered outcomes, from mood disorders to surgical recovery,
are becoming a reality. Similar past studies have been small in scale and have
provided wearable GPS devices to subjects. These devices typically collect
mobility traces continuously without significant gaps in the data, and
consequently the problem of data missingness has been safely ignored.
Leveraging subjects' own smartphones makes it possible to scale up and extend
the duration of these types of studies, but at the same time introduces a
substantial challenge: to preserve a smartphone's battery, GPS can be active
only for a small portion of the time, frequently less than $10\%$, leading to a
tremendous missing data problem. We introduce a principled statistical
approach, based on weighted resampling of the observed data, to impute the
missing mobility traces, which we then summarize using different mobility
measures. We compare the strengths of our approach to linear interpolation, a
popular approach for dealing with missing data, both analytically and through
simulation of missingness for empirical data. We conclude that our imputation
approach better mirrors human mobility both theoretically and over a sample of
GPS mobility traces from 182 individuals in the Geolife data set, where,
relative to linear interpolation, imputation resulted in a 10-fold reduction in
the error averaged across all mobility features.

of $N$ particles colliding at constant rate and randomly exchanging energies.
We prove uniform (in time) propagation of chaos in Wasserstein distance with
explicit polynomial rates in $N$, for both the squared (i.e., the energy) and
non-squared particle system. These rates are of order $N^{-1/3}$ (almost, in
the non-squared case), assuming that the initial distribution of the limit
nonlinear equation has finite moments of sufficiently high order ($4+\epsilon$
is enough when using the 2-Wasserstein distance). The proof relies on a
convenient parametrization of the collision recently introduced by Hauray, as
well as on a coupling technique developed by Cortez and Fontbona.

electromagnetic waves propagate, and magneto-electric field structures emerge

involve into analysis the concepts and mathematical formalism elaborated in the
framework of classical covariant electrodynamics of continua, and to
distinguish dark analogs of well-known medium-effects, such as optical
activity, pyro-electricity, piezo-magnetism, electro- and magneto-striction and
dynamo-optical activity. The Dark Fluid is assumed to be formed by a duet of a
Dark Matter (a pseudoscalar axionic constituent) and Dark Energy (a scalar
element); respectively, we distinguish electrodynamic effects induced by these
two constituents of the Dark Fluid. The review contains discussions of ten
models, which describe electrodynamic effects induced by Dark Matter and/or
Dark Energy. The models are accompanied by examples of exact solutions to the
master equations, correspondingly extended; applications are considered for
cosmology and space-times with spherical and pp-wave symmetries. In these
applications we focused the attention on three main electromagnetic phenomena
induced by the Dark Fluid: first, emergence of Longitudinal Magneto-Electric
Clusters; second, generation of anomalous electromagnetic responses; third,
formation of Dark Epochs in the Universe history.

in ancient DNA sequencing have allowed for complete genome sequencing for two
specimens of woolly mammoths (Palkopoulou et al. 2015). One mammoth specimen is
from a mainland population ~45,000 years ago when mammoths were plentiful. The
second, a 4300 yr old specimen, is derived from an isolated population on
Wrangel island where mammoths subsisted with small effective population size
more than 43-fold lower than previous populations. These extreme differences in
effective population size offer a rare opportunity to test nearly neutral
models of genome architecture evolution within a single species. Using these
previously published mammoth sequences, we identify deletions, retrogenes, and
non-functionalizing point mutations. In the Wrangel island mammoth, we identify
a greater number of deletions, a larger proportion of deletions affecting gene
sequences, a greater number of candidate retrogenes, and an increased number of
premature stop codons. This accumulation of detrimental mutations is consistent
with genomic meltdown in response to low effective population sizes in the
dwindling mammoth population on Wrangel island. In addition, we observe high
rates of loss of olfactory receptors and urinary proteins, either because these
loci are non-essential or because they were favored by divergent selective
pressures in island environments. Finally, at the locus of FOXQ1 we observe two
independent loss-of-function mutations, which would confer a satin coat
phenotype in this island woolly mammoth.

leverage the CCN data characteristics where content is typically short-lived

longest retention time damages the memory device thus reducing its lifetime.
However, writing using a small retention time can increase the content
retrieval delay, since, at the time a file is requested, the file may already
have been expired from the memory. This motivates us to consider a joint
optimization wherein we obtain optimal policies for jointly minimizing the
content retrieval delay (which is a network-centric objective) and the flash
damage (which is a device-centric objective). Caching decisions now not only
involve what to cache but also for how long to cache each file. We design

parameters such as desired range (km), specific energy of the battery (Wh/Kg),
cycle life requirement and expected price per unit capacity (Euro/kWh) to be
calculated. These projected performance requirements are compared with the
outputs for three existing Li-ion batteries (namely (a) Kokam based high
specific energy source (b) A123 based high power energy source and (c) Winston
low cost system). The theoretical, current state of the art and projected
performance parameters for 'beyond Li-ion' technologies (Li-S and Li-O2) are
also compared to the modeled battery performance demands. The analysis
indicates that current battery technologies are unlikely to meet future
requirements in terms of required specific energies and will likely be too
costly. In comparison, fully realized beyond Li-ion alternatives may deliver
the required specific energy for the full range of vehicles examined. However,
scale-up of these systems is a daunting challenge and their successful

infinite-dimensional function spaces. Traditional Markov chain Monte Carlo
(MCMC) algorithms are characterized by deteriorating mixing times upon
mesh-refinement, when the finite-dimensional approximations become more
accurate. Such methods are typically forced to reduce step-sizes as the
discretization gets finer, and thus are expensive as a function of dimension.
Recently, a new class of MCMC methods with mesh-independent convergence times
has emerged. However, few of them take into account the geometry of the
posterior informed by the data. At the same time, recently developed geometric
MCMC algorithms have been found to be powerful in exploring complicated
distributions that deviate significantly from elliptic Gaussian laws, but are
in general computationally intractable for models defined in infinite
dimensions. In this work, we combine geometric methods on a finite-dimensional
subspace with mesh-independent infinite-dimensional approaches. Our objective
is to speed up MCMC mixing times, without significantly increasing the
computational cost per step (for instance, in comparison with the vanilla
preconditioned Crank-Nicolson (pCN) method). This is achieved by using ideas
from geometric MCMC to probe the complex structure of an intrinsic
finite-dimensional subspace where most data information concentrates, while
retaining robust mixing times as the dimension grows by using pCN-like methods
in the complementary subspace. The resulting algorithms are demonstrated in the
context of three challenging inverse problems arising in subsurface flow, heat
conduction and incompressible flow control. The algorithms exhibit up to two
orders of magnitude improvement in sampling efficiency when compared with the
pCN method.

These measurements will provide complementary measurements of the growth rate
of large scale structure $f$ and the expansion rate of the Universe $H$ to
galaxy clustering measurements. This paper emphasizes that there is significant
information in the anisotropy of the relative pairwise kSZ measurements. We
expand the relative pairwise kSZ power spectrum in Legendre polynomials and
consider up to its octopole. Assuming that the noise in the filtered maps is
uncorrelated between the positions of galaxies in the survey, we derive a
simple analytic form for the power spectrum covariance of the relative pairwise
kSZ temperature in redshift space. While many previous studies have assumed
optimistically that the optical depth of the galaxies $\tau_{\rm T}$ in the
survey is known, we marginalize over $\tau_{\rm T}$, to compute constraints on
the growth rate $f$ and the expansion rate $H$. For realistic sure parameters,
we find that combining kSZ and galaxy redshift survey data reduces the

structural information) from these graphs it is important to capture the
context under which the neighbourhoods are reachable to accurately detect
malicious neighbourhoods.
  We observe that state-of-the-art graph kernels, such as Weisfeiler-Lehman
kernel (WLK) capture the structural information well but fail to capture
contextual information. To address this, we develop the Contextual
Weisfeiler-Lehman kernel (CWLK) which is capable of capturing both these types
of information. We show that for the malware detection problem, CWLK is more
expressive and hence more accurate than WLK while maintaining comparable

provide a mechanism by which a $S \to \gamma \gamma$ signal persists while $S

that these Hidden Valley like models invoking $S \to aa \to 4 \gamma$ must also
contend with $Z \to a (\to \gamma \gamma) \gamma$ constraints coming from CDF
and ATLAS. Within an effective field theory framework, we work out the
constraints on the couplings of $S$ to $a$ and gauge bosons coming from
photonic $Z$ decays and ensuring that the ALPs decay inside the electromagnetic
calorimeter, in two regimes - where $a$ decays primarily to photons, and where
$a$ also has hadronic branchings. The analysis is done for both when $S$ has a
large as well as a narrow width, and for different relative contributions to
the signal coming from $S \to \gamma \gamma$ and $a \to \gamma \gamma$. Results
for the particular case where $S$ and $a$ belong to the same complex field are
also presented. A $\gamma\gamma$ resonance at the $Z$-pole coming from $Z \to a
\gamma$ is expected in this class of models. Taking benchmark ALP masses below
around 0.4 GeV and, assuming reasonable values for the fake jet rate and the
identification efficiency of the photon-jet, we find the prospects for the

design two novel spectral methods by modifying the polynomial basis to fit the
singularities of the eigenfunctions. At the second stage, we move to circular
sectors in the two dimensional setting. Again the radial direction can be
expressed by Bessel functions of fractional degrees. Only in the tangential
direction some modifications are needed from stage one. At the final stage, we
extend the idea to arbitrary polygonal domains. We propose a mortar spectral
element approach: a polygonal domain is decomposed into several sub-domains
with each singular corner including the origin covered by a circular sector, in
which origin and corner singularities are handled similarly as in the former
stages, and the remaining domains are either a standard quadrilateral/triangle
or a quadrilateral/triangle with a circular edge, in which the traditional
polynomial based spectral method is applied. All sub-domains are linked by
mortar elements (note that we may have hanging nodes). In all three stages,
exponential convergence rates are achieved. Numerical experiments indicate that
our new methods are superior to standard polynomial based spectral (or spectral
element) methods and $hp$-adaptive methods. Our study offers a new and
effective way to handle eigenvalue problems of the Schr\""{o}dinger operator

suggest that there should be a hidden mechanism controlling the ME coupling in
these compounds, probably related to the magnetic striction or a spontaneous
change of the magnetic structure, which breaks the inversion symmetry.
Furthermore, we argue that unlike in other ME systems (e.g. Cr2O3), in Co4Nb2O9
and Co4Ta2O9 there are two crystallographic sublattices, which contribute to
the ME effect. These contributions are found to be of the opposite sign and
tend to compensate each other. The latter mechanism can be also used to control
and reverse the electric polarization in these compounds.

online models that incorporate some stochasticity in the arrival process. One
such popular model is the ""known I.I.D. model"" where different customer-types
arrive online from a known distribution. We develop algorithms with improved
competitive ratios for some basic variants of this model with integral arrival
rates, including (a) the case of general weighted edges, where we improve the
best-known ratio of 0.667 due to Haeupler, Mirrokni and Zadimoghaddam to 0.705;
and (b) the vertex-weighted case, where we improve the 0.7250 ratio of Jaillet

variant where each edge has an independent probability of being present. For
the setting of stochastic rewards with non-integral arrival rates, we present a
simple optimal non-adaptive algorithm with a ratio of 1 - 1/e. For the special
case where each edge is unweighted and has a uniform constant probability of
being present, we improve upon 1 - 1/e by proposing a strengthened LP

that the boundary states of this orbifold carry a quantum anomaly that
determines the topological class of the SPT. We illustrate this connection

numbers, and we consider the cases that $K<M$. The GMPID is a low-complexity
message passing algorithm based on a fully connected loopy graph, which is well
understood to be not convergent in some cases. As it is hard to analyse the
GMPID directly, the large-scale property of the massive MU-MIMO is used to
simplify the analysis. Firstly, we prove that the variances of the GMPID
definitely converge to the mean square error of Minimum Mean Square Error
(MMSE) detection. Secondly, we propose two sufficient conditions that the means
of the GMPID converge to those of the MMSE detection. However, the means of
GMPID may not converge when $ K/M\geq (\sqrt{2}-1)^2$. Therefore, a new
convergent GMPID called SA-GMPID (scale-and-add GMPID) , which converges to the
MMSE detection in mean and variance for any $K<M$ and has a faster convergence
speed than the GMPID, but has no higher complexity than the GMPID, is proposed.
Finally, numerical results are provided to verify the validity and accuracy of
the theoretical results.

We study a sample of eight B[e] stars with uncertain evolutionary
status to shed light on the origin of their circumstellar dust.
  Methods. We performed a diagnostic analysis on the spectral energy
distribution beyond infrared wavelengths, and conducted a census of neighboring
region of each target to ascertain its evolutionary status.
  Results. In comparison to pre-main sequence Herbig stars, these B[e] stars
show equally substantial excess emission in the near-infrared, indicative of
existence of warm dust, but much reduced excess at longer wavelengths, so the
dusty envelopes should be compact in size. Isolation from star-forming regions
excludes the possibility of their pre-main sequence status. Six of our targets,
including HD 50138, HD 45677, CD-245721, CD-49 3441, MWC 623, and HD 85567,
have been previously considered as FS CMa stars, whereas HD 181615/6 and HD
98922 are added to the sample by this work. We argue that the circumstellar
grains of these isolated B[e] stars, already evolved beyond the pre-main
sequence phase, should be formed in situ. This is in contrast to Herbig stars,
which inherit large grains from parental molecular clouds. It has been thought
that HD 98922, in particular, is a Herbig star because of its large infrared
excess, but we propose it being in a more evolved stage. Because dust condenses
out of stellar mass loss in an inside-out manner, the dusty envelope is
spatially confined, and anisotropic mass flows, or anomalous optical properties
of tiny grains, lead to the generally low line-of-sight extinction toward these
stars.

Markov wiretap channel (FSM-WC). We assume that the state is perfectly known by
the legitimate receiver and the eavesdropper, and through a noiseless feedback
channel, the legitimate receiver sends his received channel output and the
state back to the transmitter after some time delay. Inner and outer bounds on
the capacity-equivocation regions of the FSM-WC with delayed state feedback and
with or without delayed channel output feedback are provided in this paper, and
we show that these bounds meet if the eavesdropper's received symbol is a
degraded version of the legitimate receiver's. The above results are further
explained via degraded Gaussian and Gaussian fading examples.

With colored-diquark operators in the Coulomb gauge, we measure components of

we estimate the dominant range of gluon (color) exchanges between closely

originating in the color exchange processes from trivial colored two-quark
components contained in two color-singlet hadrons as a result of simple
transformation of hadronic basis, we repeat the analyses on the artificially

decoupled and only restricted pair of quarks can share and exchange
low-momentum gluons. We observe qualitatively the same behaviors and confirm

estimate the true DOA's with no ambiguities. However, the proposed algorithm
requires a large number of antenna array elements to accurately estimate the

suggest two variants of the algorithm. One is to add virtual elements in the

develop a framework using natural language processing and machine learning to
build information extraction algorithms to identify data elements in a new
primary publication, without having to go through the expensive task of manual
annotation to build gold standards for each data element type. The system is
developed in two stages. Initially, it uses information contained in existing
systematic reviews to identify the sentences from the PDF files of the included
references that contain specific data elements of interest using a modified
Jaccard similarity measure. These sentences have been treated as labeled data.A
Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier is trained on this labeled data to
extract data elements of interests from a new article. We conducted experiments
on Cochrane Database systematic reviews related to congestive heart failure
using inclusion criteria as an example data element. The empirical results show
that the proposed system automatically identifies sentences containing the data
element of interest with a high recall (93.75%) and reasonable precision
(27.05% - which means the reviewers have to read only 3.7 sentences on
average). The empirical results suggest that the tool is retrieving valuable
information from the reference articles, even when it is time-consuming to
identify them manually. Thus we hope that the tool will be useful for automatic
data extraction from biomedical research publications. The future scope of this

occurs. If there is a core of an arbitrary shape, we show that the resonance
strongly depends on the location of the source. In fact, there exists a
critical radius such that resonance occurs for sources lying within the
critical radius, whereas resonance does not occur for source lying outside the
critical radius. Our argument is based on the variational technique by making
use of the primal and dual variational principles for the elastostatic system,

stabilizing retinal images in the presence of relative motion between an

development of disparity and motion tuning in the visual cortex, the
optokinetic and vergence eye movements. This framework models the joint
emergence of both perception and behavior, and accounts for the importance of
the development of normal vergence control and binocular vision in achieving
normal monocular OKN (mOKN) behaviors. Because the model includes behavior, we
can simulate the same perturbations as performed in past experiments, such as
artificially induced strabismus. The proposed model agrees both qualitatively
and quantitatively with a number of findings from the literature on both
binocular vision as well as the optokinetic reflex. Finally, our model also
makes quantitative predictions about the OKN behavior using the same methods
used to characterize the OKN in the experimental literature.

on detecting outlier nodes. In this article, we study the properties of edges
and propose outlier edge detection algorithms using two random graph generation

edges that link these nodes, contains critical information to detect outlier
edges. We evaluated the proposed algorithms by injecting outlier edges into
some real-world graph data. Experiment results show that the proposed
algorithms can effectively detect outlier edges. In particular, the algorithm
based on the Preferential Attachment Random Graph Generation model consistently
gives good performance regardless of the test graph data. Further more, the
proposed algorithms are not limited in the area of outlier edge detection. We
demonstrate three different applications that benefit from the proposed

important clues on the formation of these very low-mass objects and on the
possibility of forming planetary systems around them. The presence of warm
dusty disks around brown dwarfs is well known, based on near- and mid-infrared
studies. High angular resolution observations of the cold outer disk are
limited; we used ALMA to attempt a first survey of young brown dwarfs in the
$\rho$-Oph star-forming region. All 17 young brown dwarfs in our sample were
observed at 890 $\mu $m in the continuum at $\sim0.\!^{\prime\prime}5$ angular
resolution. The sensitivity of our observations was chosen to detect $\sim0.5$
M$_\oplus$ of dust. We detect continuum emission in 11 disks ($\sim65$\%\ of
the total), and the estimated mass of dust in the detected disks ranges from
$\sim0.5$ to $\sim6$ M$_\oplus$. These disk masses imply that planet formation
around brown dwarfs may be relatively rare and that the supra-Jupiter mass
companions found around some brown dwarfs are probably the result of a binary
system formation. We find evidence that the two brightest disks in $\rho$-Oph
have sharp outer edges at R<~25 AU, in contrast to disks around Taurus brown
dwarfs. This difference may suggest that the different environment in
$\rho$-Oph may lead to significant differences in disk properties. A comparison
of the M$_{disk}$/M$_\ast$ ratio for brown dwarf and solar-mass systems also
shows a possible deficit of mass in brown dwarfs, which could support the
evidence for dynamical truncation of disks in the substellar regime. These
findings are still tentative and need to be put on firmer grounds by studying
the gaseous disks around brown dwarfs and by performing a more systematic and
unbiased survey of the disk population around the more massive stars.

ecosystem that provides for effective visibility into a working design and
quick debug turn-around times is essential. Overlays have the opportunity to
play a key role in this ecosystem. In this overview paper, we discuss how an
overlay fabric that allows the user to rapidly add debug instrumentation to a

overlay and some of the research challenges and opportunities that need to be
addressed. To make our exposition concrete, we use two previously-published

two spherical particles near an elastic interface such as a cell membrane. The
theory predicts the frequency dependent self- and pair-mobilities accounting
for the finite particle size up to the 5th order in the ratio between particle
diameter and wall distance as well as between diameter and interparticle
distance. We find that particle motion towards a membrane with pure bending
resistance always leads to mutual repulsion similar as in the well-known case
of a hard-wall. In the vicinity of a membrane with shearing resistance,
however, we observe an attractive interaction in a certain parameter range
which is in contrast to the behavior near a hard wall. This attraction might
facilitate surface chemical reactions. Furthermore, we show that there exists a
frequency range in which the pair-mobility for perpendicular motion exceeds its
bulk value, leading to short-lived superdiffusive behavior. Using the
analytical particle mobilities we compute collective and relative diffusion
coefficients. The appropriateness of the approximations in our analytical
results is demonstrated by corresponding boundary integral simulations which
are in excellent agreement with the theoretical predictions.

only relatively small compute kernels while consuming considerable FPGA

interconnected array of time-multiplexed FUs as an overlay architecture with
reduced instruction storage and interconnect resource requirements, which uses
a fully-pipelined, architecture-aware FU design supporting a fast context

the intensity of the transverse field. We use a combination of quantum Monte
Carlo algorithms and exact diagonalization to compute R\'enyi entropies,
quantum Fisher information, correlation functions and order parameter. We
locate the transition by means of the peak of the R\'enyi entropy and we find
agreement with the transition point estimated from the emergence of finite

which quantum fluctuations are treated as massive particles hopping on the

a fact that points towards the existence of possibly another transition deep in
the glassy phase where these particles localize, therefore leading to a
many-body localized phase.

reduction in turbulent flow dramatically depends on the bubble size. By adding
minute concentrations (6 ppm) of the surfactant Triton X-100 into otherwise
completely unchanged strongly turbulent Taylor-Couette flow containing bubbles,
we dramatically reduce the drag reduction from more than 40% to about 4%,

complexity of the map to a legible level. With schematic maps, however, this
simplification is pushed far beyond the legibility threshold and is instead
constrained by functional need and resemblance. Moreover, stylistic geometry is
often used to convey the schematic nature of the map. In this paper we explore
discretized approaches to computing a schematic shape $S$ for a simple polygon
$P$. We do so by overlaying a plane graph $G$ on $P$ as the solution space for
the schematic shape. Topological constraints imply that $S$ should describe a
simple polygon. We investigate two approaches, simple map matching and
connected face selection, based on commonly used similarity metrics.
  With the former, $S$ is a simple cycle $C$ in $G$ and we quantify resemblance
via the Fr\'echet distance. We prove that it is NP-hard to compute a cycle that
approximates the minimal Fr\'echet distance over all simple cycles in a plane
graph $G$. This result holds even if $G$ is a partial grid graph, if area
preservation is required and if we assume a given sequence of turns is
specified.
  With the latter, $S$ is a connected face set in $G$, quantifying resemblance
via the symmetric difference. Though the symmetric difference seems a less
strict measure, we prove that it is NP-hard to compute the optimal face set.
This result holds even if $G$ is full grid graph or a triangular or hexagonal
tiling, and if area preservation is required. Moreover, it is independent of
whether we allow the set of faces to have holes or not.

source, we consider the finite blocklength (FBL) throughput of a two-hop
relaying system. Previous work has considered this setting so far only for the
infinite blocklength case, where decoding can be arbitrarily reliable as long
as operating below the Shannon limit. In contrast, in the FBL regime residual
decoding errors can not be avoided even when transmitting below the Shannon
limit. This makes the scheduling problem at the source more vulnerable to
transmission errors, where we investigate the trade-off between the choice of
so called scheduling weights to avoid transmission errors and the resulting
coding rate. We show that the corresponding maximization of the throughput
under a reliability constraint can be solved efficiently by iterative
algorithms. Nevertheless, the optimal solution requires a recomputation of the
scheduling weights prior to each transmission. Thus, we also study heuristics
relying on choosing the scheduling weights only once. Through numerical
analysis, we first provide insights on the structure of the throughout under
different scheduling weights and channel correlation coefficients. We then turn
to the comparison of the optimal scheduling with the heuristic and show that
the performance gap between them is only significant for relay systems with
high average signal-to-noise ratios (SNR) on the backhaul and relaying link. In
particular, the optimal scheduling scheme provides most value in case that the
data transmission is subject to strict reliability constraints, justifying the
significant additional computational burden.

unambiguous ice chemistry origin. The stacked methanol emission, as observed
with ALMA, is spectrally resolved and detected across six velocity channels
($>3 \sigma$), reaching a peak signal-to-noise of $5.5\sigma$, with the
kinematic pattern expected for TW~Hya. Using an appropriate disk model, a
fractional abundance of $3\times 10^{-12} - 4 \times 10^{-11}$ (with respect to
H$_2$) reproduces the stacked line profile and channel maps, with the favoured
abundance dependent upon the assumed vertical location (midplane versus
molecular layer). The peak emission is offset from the source position
suggesting that the methanol emission has a ring-like morphology: the analysis
here suggests it peaks at $\approx 30$~AU reaching a column density $\approx
3-6\times10^{12}$~cm$^{-2}$. In the case of TW Hya, the larger (up to mm-sized)
grains, residing in the inner 50~AU, may thus host the bulk of the disk ice
reservoir. The successful detection of cold gas-phase methanol in a

Aims: Understanding the statistics of the two-point cross-covariance function
is a necessary step towards optimizing the measurement of travel times.
Methods: By modeling stochastic solar oscillations, we evaluate the variance of
the cross-covariance function as function of time-lag and distance between the

independent of both time-lag and distance in the far field, i.e., when they are

The constant noise level for the cross-covariance means that the

second-order M{\o}ller-Plesset perturbation theory (MP2) energies for
two-component Hamiltonians in the Kramers-restricted formalism. This low-order
scaling technique can be used to enable correlated relativistic calculations
for large molecular systems. We show that the working equations to compute the
relativistic MP2 energy differ by merely a change of algebra (quaternion
instead of real) from their non-relativistic counterparts. With a
proof-of-principle implementation we study the effect of the nuclear charge on
the magnitude of half-transformed integrals and show that for light elements
spin-free and spin-orbit MP2 energies are almost identical. Furthermore, we
investigate the effect of separation of charge distributions on the Coulomb and
exchange energy con- tributions, which show the same long-range decay with the
inter-electronic / atomic distance as for non-relativistic MP2. A linearly
scaling implementation is possible if the proper distance behavior is
introduced to the quaternion Schwarz-type estimates as for non-relativistic
MP2.

  interaction and different degrees of mixing","34 pages, 2 figures",,,,"cond-mat.stat-mech","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Dynamics of many-particle systems with long-range interaction is
collisionless and governed by the Vlasov equation. This dynamics is a flow of a
six-dimensional incompressible liquid with uncountable integrals of motion. If
the flow possesses the statistical property of mixing, each liquid element
spreads over the entire accessible space. I derive the equilibrium
microcanonical maximum entropy states of this liquid for different degrees of
mixing $M$. This $M$ is the number of liquid elements which are statistically
independent. To count microstates of a liquid, I develop analog of the discrete
combinatorics for continuous systems by introducing the ensemble of phase
subspaces and making contact with the Shannon-McMillan-Breiman theorem from the
ergodic theory. If $M$ is much larger than the total number of particles $N$,
then the equilibrium distribution function (DF) is found to be exactly of the
Fermi-Dirac form. If the system is ergodic but without mixing, $M=0$, the DF is
a formal expression which coincides with the famous DF obtained by Lynden-Bell.
If the mixing is incomplete and $M\sim N$, the exponentials, which are present
in Lynden-Bell's DF, appear with certain weight given by the entropy of mixing.
For certainty, the \ long-range interaction is taken in the form of the Newton
and Coulomb potential in three dimensional space, but the applicability of the
method developed in the paper is not restricted to this case. The analogy of
the obtained statistics to the Fermi-Dirac statistics allows for expressing the
entropy of the system via its total energy and chemical potentials of liquid's
elements. The effect of the long-range interaction to the basic thermodynamic
relations is demonstrated.

information about the interference at the SBS to re-design the CR beamforming
optimization problem. This is done with the objective to improve the quality of
service (QoS) of secondary users by taking advantage of constructive
interference in the secondary link. The beamformers are designed to minimize
the worst secondary user's symbol error probability (SEP) under constraints on
the instantaneous total transmit power, and the power of the instantaneous
interference in the primary link. The problem is formulated as a bivariate
probabilistic constrained programming (BPCP) problem. We show that the BPCP
problem can be transformed for practical SEPs into a convex optimization
problem that can be solved, e.g., by the barrier method. A computationally
efficient tight approximate approach is also developed to compute the
near-optimal solutions. Simulation results and analysis show that the average
computational complexity per downlink frame of the proposed approximate problem
is comparable to that of the conventional CR downlink beamforming problem. In
addition, both the proposed methods offer significant performance improvements
as compared to the conventional CR downlink beamforming, while guaranteeing the
QoS of primary users on an instantaneous basis, in contrast to the average QoS
guarantees of conventional beamformers.

related to a non-equilibrium heat and not, as in equilibrium, to a volume
derivative of an average energy. The non-equilibrium work fluctuations are
determined and shown to be very anomalous compared to equilibrium work
fluctuations. The non-equilibrium work distribution is also computed, and

basic dynamical resource is the ability to couple the system to a
traveling-wave field (for example, a transmission line) via a system
observable, and the fundamental limitation is the maximum rate that is
available for this coupling. We focus on the question of the best achievable
control given ideal controllers. To obtain a fair comparison we acknowledge
that the amplification involved in measurement-based control allows the
controller to use macroscopic fields to apply feedback forces to the system, so
it is natural to allow these feedback forces to be much larger than the
mesoscopic coupling to the transmission line that mediates both the measurement
for measurement-based control and the coupling to the mesoscopic controller for
coherent control. Interestingly our numerical results indicate that under the
above platform for comparison, coherent feedback is able to exactly match the
performance of measurement-based feedback given ideal controllers. We also
discuss various properties of, and control mechanisms for, coherent feedback
networks.

intrinsically interdisciplinary domain of research strives to go beyond the
traditional use of mathematics as a tool to model and understand the behaviour

in turn, how these insights can lead to new methods, models and notation of
computation and new approaches to computational and mathematical problems.
Topics falling into this category at the interface of physics and computation
that are within the scope of the conference include, amongst many others, the
axiomatisation of physics, hypercomputation, the role of information in
physical systems, quantum information, randomness in physics, theories of
measurement, and the philosophy of physics and computation.

optoelectronic applications. In the past few decades, substantial effort has
been engaged for doping at the nanoscale. Recently, doped zero-dimensional
quantum dots made of semiconductor nanocrystals have been demonstrated to be
promising materials for luminescent solar concentrators (LSCs) as they can be
engineered for providing Stokes-shifted tunable emission in the solar spectrum.
However, existing doped colloidal quantum dots suffer from moderately low
quantum efficiency and intrinsically small absorption cross-section, which
together fundamentally limit their effective usage. Here, we show the first
account of copper doping into two-dimensional atomically flat CdSe colloidal
quantum wells. Copper doping via post-synthesis partial cation exchange into
3-5 monolayers of CdSe and CdSe/CdS core-shell colloidal quantum wells (CQWs)
enables Stokes-shifted, tunable dopant induced highly efficient
photoluminescence emission having high quantum efficiencies (>43%), accompanied
by an order of magnitude higher absorption cross-section than that of the doped
quantum dots. Based on these exceptional properties, we demonstrated a flexible
prototype luminescent solar concentrators using these newly synthesized doped
colloidal quantum wells. These findings may open up new directions for
deployment of CQWs in LSCs for advanced solar light harvesting technologies.

(1) because the spins of the black holes could not be measured accurately and
because mergers are not well calculated for modified theories of gravity, the
current analysis of GW150914 does not place strong constraints on gravity
variants that change only the generation of gravitational waves, but (2) it
does strongly constrain alterations of the propagation of gravitational waves

the pure currency use case of Bitcoin. We investigate the blockchains' activity
in terms of transactions and usage patterns, identifying some curiosities in
the process. For Ethereum, we are mostly interested in the smart contract

introduced by negligent design of smart contracts. In the case of Namecoin, our
focus is how the name registration is used and has developed over time. For
Peercoin, we are interested in the use of proof-of-stake, as this consensus
algorithm is poorly understood yet used to move considerable value. Finally, we
relate the above to the fundamental characteristics of the underlying
peer-to-peer networks. We present a crawler for Ethereum and give statistics on

energy functionals with random (stationary and ergodic) pair interactions, our
problem corresponds to a stochastic homogenization problem. In the
non-degenerate case, when the interactions satisfy a uniform $p$-growth
condition, the homogenization problem is well-understood. In this paper, we are
interested in a degenerate situation, when the interactions neither satisfy a
uniform growth condition from above nor from below. We consider interaction
potentials that obey a $p$-growth condition with a random growth weight
$\lambda$. We show that if $\lambda$ satisfies the moment condition $\mathbb
E[\lambda^\alpha+\lambda^{-\beta}]<\infty$ for suitable values of $\alpha$ and
$\beta$, then the discrete energy $\Gamma$-converges to an integral functional
with a non-degenerate energy density. In the scalar case it suffices to assume
that $\alpha\geq 1$ and $\beta\geq\frac{1}{p-1}$ (which is just the condition
that ensures the non-degeneracy of the homogenized energy density). In the
general, vectorial case, we additionally require that $\alpha>1$ and
$\frac{1}{\alpha}+\frac{1}{\beta}\leq \frac{p}{d}$. Recently, there has been
considerable effort to understand periodic and stochastic homogenization of
elliptic equations and integral functionals with degenerate growth, as well as
related questions on the effective behavior of conductance models in
degenerate, random environments. The results in the present paper are to our
knowledge the first stochastic homogenization results for nonconvex energy

handwriting recognition. Chinese characters are among the most widely adopted
writing systems in the world. Previous research has mainly focused on
recognizing handwritten Chinese characters. However, recognition is only one
aspect for understanding a language, another challenging and interesting task
is to teach a machine to automatically write (pictographic) Chinese characters.
In this paper, we propose a framework by using the recurrent neural network
(RNN) as both a discriminative model for recognizing Chinese characters and a
generative model for drawing (generating) Chinese characters. To recognize
Chinese characters, previous methods usually adopt the convolutional neural
network (CNN) models which require transforming the online handwriting
trajectory into image-like representations. Instead, our RNN based approach is
an end-to-end system which directly deals with the sequential structure and
does not require any domain-specific knowledge. With the RNN system (combining
an LSTM and GRU), state-of-the-art performance can be achieved on the
ICDAR-2013 competition database. Furthermore, under the RNN framework, a
conditional generative model with character embedding is proposed for
automatically drawing recognizable Chinese characters. The generated characters
(in vector format) are human-readable and also can be recognized by the
discriminative RNN model with high accuracy. Experimental results verify the
effectiveness of using RNNs as both generative and discriminative models for
the tasks of drawing and recognizing Chinese characters.

solution of the regularized long wave (RLW) equation. A moving mesh strategy
based on the so-called moving mesh PDE is used to adaptively move the mesh to
improve computational accuracy and efficiency. The RLW equation represents a
class of partial differential equations containing spatial-time mixed
derivatives. For the numerical solution of those equations, a $C^0$ finite
element method cannot apply directly on a moving mesh since the mixed
derivatives of the finite element approximation may not be defined. To avoid
this difficulty, a new variable is introduced and the RLW equation is rewritten
into a system of two coupled equations. The system is then discretized using
linear finite elements in space and the fifth-order Radau IIA scheme in time. A
range of numerical examples in one and two dimensions, including the RLW
equation with one or two solitary waves and special initial conditions that
lead to the undular bore and solitary train solutions, are presented. Numerical
results demonstrate that the method has a second order convergence and is able
to move and adapt the mesh to the evolving features in the solution.

on the behavior of active main sequence stars we speculate that the convective
shells can trigger magnetic activity with a power of about 0.001 times the
convective luminosity. Magnetic flux tubes might buoy outward, and deposit
their energy in the outer parts of the envelope. This in turn might lead to the
expansion of the envelope and to an enhanced mass loss rate. If a close binary
companion is present, mass transfer might take place and lead to an energetic
outburst. The magnetic activity requires minimum core rotation and that the
stochastic magnetic activity be on its high phase. Only in rare cases these
conditions are met, accounting for that only the minority of core collapse
supernovae (CCSNe) experience PEO. Such a pre-explosion magnetic activity might
have implications for the explosion mechanism itself.

interdependence of stochastic forces affecting different particles in the same
solution, is a largely overlooked phenomenon with no well-established theory.
Recently, we have proposed a novel type of thermodynamically consistent
Langevin dynamics driven by the Spatially Correlated Noise (SCN) that can
contribute to the understanding of this problem. This model draws a link
between the theory of effective interactions in binary colloidal mixtures and
the properties of SCN. In the current article we review this model from the
perspective of collective diffusion and generalize it to the case of multiple
($N>2$) particles. Since our theory of SCN-driven Langevin dynamics has certain
issues that could not be resolved within its framework, in this article we also
provide another approach to the problem of collectivity. We discuss the
multi-particle Mori-Zwanzig model, which is fully microscopically consistent.
Indeed, we show that this model supplies many information, complementary to the
SCN-based approach, e.g. it predicts the deterministic dynamics of the relative
distance between the particles, it provides the approximation for
non-equilibrium effective interactions and predicts the collective subdiffusion
of tracers in group. These results provide the short-range, inertial limit of
the earlier model and agree with its predictions under some general conditions.
In this article we also review the origin of SCN and its consequences for the
variety of physical systems, with emphasis on the colloids.

axisymmetric problems we examine an alternative formulation, defining the
strain based on deviations of distances (rather than distances squared) from
their rest values. While the two formulations converge in the limit of small
slopes and in the limit of an incompressible sheet, for other cases they are
found not to be equivalent. The alternative formulation offers several features
which are absent in the existing theory. (a) In the case of planar deformations
of flat incompatible sheets, it yields linear, exactly solvable, equations of
equilibrium. (b) When reduced to uniaxial (one-dimensional) deformations, it
coincides with the theory of extensible elastica; in particular, for a
uniaxially bent sheet it yields an unstrained cylindrical configuration. (c) It
gives a simple criterion determining whether an isometric immersion of an
incompatible sheet is at mechanical equilibrium with respect to normal forces.
For a reference metric of constant positive Gaussian curvature, a spherical cap
is found to satisfy this criterion except in an arbitrarily narrow boundary
layer.

from cardiac output on the sensitivity of a human compliant arterial network
response based on stochastic simulations of a reduced-order pulse wave
propagation model. A simple pulsatile output form is utilized to reproduce the
most relevant cardiac features with a minimum number of parameters associated
with left ventricle dynamics. Another source of critical uncertainty is the
spatial heterogeneity of the aortic compliance which plays a key role in the
propagation and damping of pulse waves generated at each cardiac cycle. A
continuous representation of the aortic stiffness in the form of a generic
random field of prescribed spatial correlation is then considered. Resorting to
a stochastic sparse pseudospectral method, we investigate the spatial
sensitivity of the pulse pressure and waves reflection magnitude with respect
to the different model uncertainties. Results indicate that uncertainties
related to the shape and magnitude of the prescribed inlet flow in the proximal
aorta can lead to potent variation of both the mean value and standard
deviation of blood flow velocity and pressure dynamics due to the interaction
of different wave propagation and reflection features. These results have
potential physiological and pathological implications. They will provide some
guidance in clinical data acquisition and future coupling of arterial pulse

projected on coherent states of angular momentum. We give explicit expressions
for the projections of intertwiners on the spin coherent states in terms of
complex numbers describing the unit vectors which label the coherent states.
Operators such as the Hamiltonian can then be reformulated as differential
operators acting on polynomials of these complex numbers. This makes it
possible to describe the action of the Hamiltonian geometrically, in terms of
the unit vectors originating from the angular momentum coherent states, and
opens up a way towards investigating the semiclassical limit of the dynamics
via asymptotic approximation methods.

used to evaluate the performance of clinical prediction models. Recently, a
more refined strategy has been proposed to examine a partial area under the
curve (pAUC), which can account for differing costs associated with false
negative versus false positive results. Such consideration can substantially
increase the clinical utility of prediction models depending on the clinical
question. Properties of the pAUC estimator create significant challenges for
pAUC-optimal marker selection and model building. As such, current approaches
towards these aims can be complex and computationally intensive. We present a
simpler method based on weighted logistic regressions. We refer to our strategy
as logistic push, due to shared heuristics with the ranking algorithm P-norm
push. Logistic push is particularly useful in the high-dimensional setting,
where fast and broadly available algorithms for fitting penalized regressions
can be used for both marker selection and model fitting.

problems have efficient solutions when restricted to graphs of bounded

Sometimes the more restricted path decomposition is required. The bottleneck
for such algorithms is often the computation of the width and a corresponding
tree or path decomposition. For graphs with $n$ vertices and tree-width or
path-width $k$, the standard linear time algorithm to compute these
decompositions dates back to 1996. Its running time is linear in $n$ and
exponential in $k^3$ and not usable in practice. Here we present a more
efficient algorithm to compute the path-width and provide a path decomposition.
Its running time is $2^{O(k^2)} n$. In the classical algorithm of Bodlaender

an optimal path decomposition is computed from a path decomposition of about
twice the width. The latter is computed from a constant factor smaller graph.

on thousands of flaring events, allowing a statistical analysis of the flare
properties. In this paper, we investigate the X-ray and IR flux distributions
of the flare events. Using a self-consistent calculation of the particle
distribution, we model the statistical properties of the flares. Based on a
previous work on single flares, we consider two families of models: pure
synchrotron models and synchrotron self-Compton (SSC) models. We investigate
the effect of fluctuations in some relevant parameters (e.g. acceleration
properties, density, magnetic field) on the flux distributions. The
distribution of these parameters is readily derived from the flux distributions
observed at different wavelengths. In both scenarios, we find that fluctuations
of the power injected in accelerated particles plays a major role. This must be
distributed as a power-law (with different indices in each model). In the
synchrotron dominated scenario, we derive the most extreme values of the
acceleration power required to reproduce the brightest flares. In that model,
the distribution of the acceleration slope fluctuations is constrained and in
the SSC scenario we constrain the distributions of the correlated magnetic
field and flow density variations.

neither are logical 0 or logical 1, breaking the abstraction of Boolean logic.
Unfortunately, any way of reading a signal from an unsynchronized clock domain
or performing an analog-to-digital conversion incurs the risk of a metastable
upset; no digital circuit can deterministically avoid, resolve, or detect
metastability (Marino, 1981). Synchronizers, the only traditional
countermeasure, exponentially decrease the odds of maintained metastability
over time. Trading synchronization delay for an increased probability to
resolve metastability to logical 0 or 1, they do not guarantee success.
  We propose a fundamentally different approach: It is possible to contain
metastability by fine-grained logical masking so that it cannot infect the
entire circuit. This technique guarantees a limited degree of metastability
in---and uncertainty about---the output.
  At the heart of our approach lies a time- and value-discrete model for
metastability in synchronous clocked digital circuits. Metastability is
propagated in a worst-case fashion, allowing to derive deterministic
guarantees, without and unlike synchronizers. The proposed model permits
positive results and passes the test of reproducing Marino's impossibility
results. We fully classify which functions can be computed by circuits with
standard registers. Regarding masking registers, we show that they become
computationally strictly more powerful with each clock cycle, resulting in a
non-trivial hierarchy of computable functions.

linearly increases with feedback delay, up to a certain point when tracking
performance deteriorates. It also explains the transition from reactive to

quantitative predictions that can be tested in further experiments.

archival data for the broad lines observed in the far-ultra-violet. The goal is
to find a physical connection among the lines measured at different wavelengths
and determine the size and the distance from the central source of the emitting
gas components. We used the ""Locally optimally emission Cloud"" (LOC) model
which interprets the emissivity of the broad line region (BLR) as regulated by
powerlaw distributions of both gas density and distances from the central
source. We find that one LOC component cannot model all the lines
simultaneously. In particular, we find that the X-ray and UV lines likely may
originate in the more internal part of the AGN, at radii in the range
~5x10^{14}-3x10^{17} cm, while the optical lines and part of the UV lines may
likely be originating further out, at radii ~3x10^{17}-3x^{18} cm. These two
gas components are parametrized by a radial distribution of the luminosities
with a slope gamma of ~1.15 and ~1.10, respectively, both of them covering at
least 60% of the source. This simple parameterization points to a structured
broad line region, with the higher ionized emission coming from closer in,
while the emission of the low-ionization lines is more concentrated in the
outskirts of the broad line region.

learning. However, as high-capacity supervised neural networks trained with a
large amount of labels have achieved remarkable success in many computer vision
tasks, the availability of large-scale labeled images reduced the significance
of unsupervised learning. Inspired by the recent trend toward revisiting the
importance of unsupervised learning, we investigate joint supervised and
unsupervised learning in a large-scale setting by augmenting existing neural
networks with decoding pathways for reconstruction. First, we demonstrate that
the intermediate activations of pretrained large-scale classification networks
preserve almost all the information of input images except a portion of local
spatial details. Then, by end-to-end training of the entire augmented
architecture with the reconstructive objective, we show improvement of the
network performance for supervised tasks. We evaluate several variants of
autoencoders, including the recently proposed ""what-where"" autoencoder that
uses the encoder pooling switches, to study the importance of the architecture
design. Taking the 16-layer VGGNet trained under the ImageNet ILSVRC 2012
protocol as a strong baseline for image classification, our methods improve the
validation-set accuracy by a noticeable margin.

attributed to the surface tension of the membrane. In order to model this
phenomenon, a model involving a coupling between the local composition and the
local curvature was proposed by Seul and Andelman in 1995. In addition to the
familiar Cahn-Hilliard/Modica-Mortola energy, there are additional `forces'
that prevent large domains of homogeneous concentration. This is taken into
account by the bending energy of the membrane, which is coupled to the value of
the order parameter, and reflects the notion that surface tension associated
with a slightly curved membrane influences the localization of phases as the
geometry of the lipids has an effect on the preferred placement on the
membrane.
  The main result of the paper is the study of the $\Gamma$-convergence of this
family of energy functionals, involving nonlocal as well as negative terms.
Since the minimizers of the limiting energy have minimal interfaces, the
physical interpretation is that, within a sufficiently strong interspecies
surface tension and a large enough sample size, raft microdomains are not
formed.

solids, they also undergo an inhomogeneous, non-affine deformation, which can
have a crucial impact on the overall elastic response. To correctly understand
the elastic modulus $M$, it is therefore necessary to take into account not
only the affine modulus $M_A$, but also the non-affine modulus $M_N$ that
arises from the non-affine deformation. In the present work, we study the bulk
($M=K$) and shear ($M=G$) moduli in static jammed particulate packings over a
range of packing fractions $\varphi$. One novelty of this work is to elucidate
the contribution of each vibrational mode to the non-affine $M_N$ through a
modal decomposition of the displacement and force fields. In the vicinity of
the (un)jamming transition, $\varphi_{c}$, the vibrational density of states,
$g(\omega)$, shows a plateau in the intermediate frequency regime above a
characteristic frequency $\omega^\ast$. We illustrate that this unusual feature
apparent in $g(\omega)$ is reflected in the behavior of $M_N$: As $\varphi
\rightarrow \varphi_c$, where $\omega^\ast \rightarrow 0$, those modes for
$\omega < \omega^\ast$ contribute less and less, while contributions from those
for $\omega > \omega^\ast$ approach a constant value which results in $M_N$ to
approach a critical value $M_{Nc}$, as $M_N-M_{Nc} \sim \omega^\ast$. At
$\varphi_c$ itself, the bulk modulus attains a finite value $K_c=K_{Ac}-K_{Nc}
> 0$, such that $K_{Nc}$ has a value that remains below $K_{Ac}$. In contrast,
for the critical shear modulus $G_c$, $G_{Nc}$ and $G_{Ac}$ approach the same
value so that the total value becomes exactly zero, $G_c = G_{Ac}-G_{Nc} =0$.
We explore what features of the configurational and vibrational properties
cause such the distinction between $K$ and $G$, allowing us to validate
analytical expressions for their critical values.

about a renaissance in phononic device physics and technology. Central to this
advance are devices and materials that support ultra long-lived photonic and
phononic excitations, providing access to novel regimes of classical and
quantum dynamics based on tailorable photon-phonon coupling. Silica-based
devices have been at the forefront of such innovations for their ability to
support optical excitations persisting for nearly 1 billion cycles, and for
their low optical nonlinearity. Remarkably, acoustic phonon modes can persist
for a comparable number of cycles in crystalline solids at cryogenic
temperatures, permitting radical enhancement of photon-phonon coupling.
However, it has not been possible to achieve similar phononic coherence times
in silica, as silica becomes acoustically opaque at low temperatures. In this
paper, we demonstrate that intrinsic forms of phonon dissipation are greatly
reduced (by > 90%) using nonlinear saturation with continuous driving fields of
disparate frequencies. We demonstrate steady-state phononic spectral hole
burning for the first time, and show that this technique for controlling
dissipation in glass produces a wide-band transparency window. These studies
were carried out in a micro-scale fiber waveguide where the acoustic
intensities necessary to manipulate phonon dissipation can be achieved with
optically generated phonon fields of modest (nW) powers. We developed a simple
model that explains both dissipative and dispersive changes produced by
phononic saturation. In showing how the dissipative and dispersive properties
of glasses can be manipulated using external fields, we open the door to
dynamical phononic switching and the use of glasses as low loss phononic media
which may enable new forms of controllable laser dynamics, information
processing, and precision metrology.

sub-dimensional expansions for a sparser recovery, and shows success when
removal of uninfluential parameters that results in a lower coherence for
measurement matrix, allows for a higher order and/or sparser expansion to be
recovered. The incremental algorithm effectively searches for the sparsest PC
approximation, and not only can it decrease the prediction error, it can also
reduce the dimensionality of PCE model. Four numerical examples are provided to
demonstrate the validity of the proposed approach. The results from these
examples show that the incremental algorithm substantially outperforms
conventional compressive sampling approaches for PCE, in terms of both solution
sparsity and prediction error.

a linear growth of the number of families with the number of particles, and

the latter. This limit is understood in terms of tangents, leading to a
refinement of the previous families. We compute explicitly the classification

its refinement using tangents. This paves the way to further use of projective

correctly. This can break the continuity of a dialogue in human-machine

stages. Given an image and a question, (1) we first determine whether the
question is visual or not, (2) if visual, we determine whether the question is
relevant to the given image or not. Our approaches, based on LSTM-RNNs, VQA
model uncertainty, and caption-question similarity, are able to outperform
strong baselines on both relevance tasks. We also present human studies showing

focusing on a model based on the quartic beyond Horndeski Lagrangian. We
self-consistently derive the scalar field profile for static spherically
symmetric objects in asymptotically de Sitter space-time and show that the
Vainshtein breaking branch of the solutions is the physical branch thereby
resolving several ambiguities with non-relativistic frameworks. The geometry
outside the star is shown to be exactly Schwarzschild-de Sitter and therefore
the PPN parameter $\beta_{\rm PPN}=1$, confirming that the external screening
works at the post-Newtonian level. The Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff (TOV)
equations are derived and a new lower bound on the Vainshtein breaking
parameter $\Upsilon_1>-4/9$ is found by requiring the existence of static
spherically symmetric stars. Focusing on the unconstrained case where
$\Upsilon_1<0$, we numerically solve the TOV equations for polytropic and
realistic equations of state and find stars with larger radii at fixed mass.
Furthermore, the maximum mass can increase dramatically and stars with masses
in excess of $3M_\odot$ can be found for relatively small values of the
Vainshtein breaking parameter. We re-examine white dwarf stars and show that
post-Newtonian corrections are important in beyond Horndeski theories and
therefore the bounds coming from previous analyses should be revisited.

Integration (MI) to improve recurrent neural networks (RNNs). MI changes the
way in which information from difference sources flows and is integrated in the
computational building block of an RNN, while introducing almost no extra
parameters. The new structure can be easily embedded into many popular RNN
models, including LSTMs and GRUs. We empirically analyze its learning behaviour
and conduct evaluations on several tasks using different RNN models. Our
experimental results demonstrate that Multiplicative Integration can provide a
substantial performance boost over many of the existing RNN models.

The superstring spectrum (type 0 and type II) is shown to exhibit an involution
symmetry, that survives the small curvature limit. We classify all marginal
states in polar coordinates for type II superstrings, with emphasis on their
links and their superconformal structure. This classification is confirmed by
an explicit large $\tau_2$ analysis of the partition function. Next we compare
three approaches towards the type II genus one entropy in Rindler space: using
a sum-over-fields strategy, using a Melvin model approach and finally using a
saddle point method on the cigar partition function. In each case we highlight
possible obstructions and motivate that the correct procedures yield a

the description and analysis of time series of events, such as neuronal spike
trains. A multiple filter test (MFT) for rate homogeneity has been proposed
earlier that detects change points on multiple time scales simultaneously. It
is based on a filtered derivative approach, and the rejection threshold derives
from a Gaussian limit process $L$ which is independent of the point process
parameters.
  Here we extend the MFT to variance homogeneity of life times. When the rate
is constant, the MFT extends directly to the null hypothesis of constant
variance. In the presence of rate change points, we propose to incorporate
estimates of these in the test for variance homogeneity, using an adaptation of
the test statistic. The resulting limit process shows slight deviations from
$L$ that depend on unknown process parameters. However, these deviations are
small and do not considerably change the properties of the statistical test.
This allows practical application, e.g.~to neuronal spike trains, which
indicates various profiles of rate and variance change points.

a number of options. Although unit tests may reveal faulty options for
individual components, functionally correct components may interact in
unforeseen ways to cause a fault. Covering arrays are used to test for
interactions among components systematically. A two-stage framework, providing
a number of concrete algorithms, is developed for the efficient construction of
covering arrays. %Our framework divides the construction in two stages. In the
first stage, a time and memory efficient randomized algorithm covers most of
the interactions. In the second stage, a more sophisticated search covers the
remainder in relatively few tests. In this way, the storage limitations of the
sophisticated search algorithms are avoided; hence the range of the number of
components for which the algorithm can be applied is extended, without
increasing the number of tests. Many of the framework instantiations can be
tuned to optimize a memory-quality trade-off, so that fewer tests can be
achieved using more memory. The algorithms developed outperform the currently
best known methods when the number of components ranges from 20 to 60, the
number of options for each ranges from 3 to 6, and $t$-way interactions are
covered for $t\in \{5,6\}$. In some cases a reduction in the number of tests by

overview of the MAGNEX features is presented. The successful application to the
precise reconstruction of the momentum vector, to the identification of the ion
masses and to the determination of the transport efficiency is demonstrated by
in-beam tests. In the second part, an overview of the most relevant scientific

well as from transfer and charge exchange reactions in a wide range of masses
of the colliding systems and incident energies are shown. The role of MAGNEX in
solving old and new puzzles in nuclear structure and direct reaction mechanisms
is emphasized. One example is the recently observed signature of the long
searched Giant Pairing Vibration. Finally, the new challenging opportunities to
use MAGNEX for future experiments are briefly reported. In particular, the use
of double charge exchange reactions toward the determination of the nuclear
matrix elements entering in the expression of the half-life of neutrinoless
double beta decay is discussed. The new NUMEN project of INFN, aiming at these

masses shows that widely neglected possibilities for nonzero particle masses
have sometimes been vindicated. In the electromagnetic case, there is permanent
underdetermination at the classical and quantum levels between Maxwell's theory
and the one-parameter family of Proca's electromagnetisms with massive photons,
which approximate Maxwell's theory in the limit of zero photon mass. While
Yang-Mills theories display similar approximate equivalence classically,
quantization typically breaks this equivalence. A possible exception, including
unified electroweak theory, might permit a mass term for the photons but not

exceptional outburst in 2012 September-October. The flare was tracked from
gamma-ray to near-infrared frequencies, including Fermi and Swift data as well
as photometric and polarimetric data from several observatories. An intensive
GASP-WEBT collaboration campaign in optical and NIR bands, with an addition of
previously unpublished archival data and extension through fall 2015, allows
comparison of this outburst with the previous activity period of this blazar in
2004-2005. We find remarkable similarity between the optical and gamma-ray
behaviour of CTA 102 during the outburst, with a time lag between the two light
curves of ~1 hour, indicative of co-spatiality of the optical and gamma-ray
emission regions. The relation between the gamma-ray and optical fluxes is
consistent with the SSC mechanism, with a quadratic dependence of the SSC
gamma-ray flux on the synchrotron optical flux evident in the post-outburst
stage. However, the gamma-ray/optical relationship is linear during the
outburst; we attribute this to changes in the Doppler factor. A strong
harder-when-brighter spectral dependence is seen both the in gamma-ray and
optical non-thermal emission. This hardening can be explained by convexity of
the UV-NIR spectrum that moves to higher frequencies owing to an increased
Doppler shift as the viewing angle decreases during the outburst stage. The
overall pattern of Stokes parameter variations agrees with a model of a
radiating blob or shock wave that moves along a helical path down the jet.

physics. In this paper, based on a two-band cubic lattice model, we studied
WSMs with a pair of tunable Weyl nodes. It is pointed out that there exist
three types of WSMs with different tilt strengths: type-I WSM, type-II WSM and
type-1.5 WSM. In particular, type-1.5 WSM has one type-I node and one type-II
node. We studied chiral modes, surface Fermi arcs and quantum anomalous Hall
effect in different types of WSMs. In addition, we give an experimental setup
to realize the different types of WSMs based on timely technique.
