report temperature, relative humidity, and other environmental parameters. The
time between two successive measurements is a critical parameter to set during
the WSN configuration because it can impact the WSN's lifetime, the wireless
medium contention and the quality of the reported data. As trends in monitored
parameters can significantly vary between scenarios and within time,
identifying a sampling interval suitable for several cases is also challenging.
In this work, we propose a dynamic sampling rate adaptation scheme based on
reinforcement learning, able to tune sensors' sampling interval on-the-fly,
according to environmental conditions and application requirements. The primary
goal is to set the sampling interval to the best value possible so as to avoid
oversampling and save energy, while not missing environmental changes that can
be relevant for the application. In simulations, our mechanism could reduce up
to 73% the total number of transmissions compared to a fixed strategy and,
simultaneously, keep the average quality of information provided by the WSN.
The inherent flexibility of the reinforcement learning algorithm facilitates
its use in several scenarios, so as to exploit the broad scope of the Internet
of Things.

protocols is a central goal of quantum information science. While many authors
have linked global measures of correlations such as entanglement or discord to
the performance of specific protocols, in general the latter may require only
correlations between specific observables. In this work, we first introduce a
general measure of correlations for two-qubit states based on the classical
mutual information between local observables. We then discuss the role of the
symmetry in the state's correlations distribution and accordingly provide a
classification of maximally mixed marginals states (MMMS). We discuss the
complementarity relation between correlations and coherence. By focusing on a
simple yet paradigmatic example, i.e., the remote state preparation protocol,
we introduce a method to systematically define proper protocol-tailored
measures of correlations. The method is based on the identification of those
correlations that are relevant (useful) for the protocol. The approach allows
on one hand to discuss the role of the symmetry of the correlations
distribution in determining the efficiency of the protocol, both for MMMS and
general two-qubit quantum states, and on the other hand to devise an optimized
protocol for non-MMMS that can have a better efficiency with respect to the
standard one. The scheme we propose can be extended to other communication
protocols and more general bipartite settings. Overall our findings clarify how
the key resources in simple communication protocols are the purity of the state
used and the symmetry of correlations distribution.

peak at higher frequency. The energy scale of this gap-like feature is
comparable to the width of the band splitting observed by ARPES. The
low-frequency conductivity consists of two Drude components and the overall
plasma frequency is smaller than that of the FeAs based compounds, suggesting a
lower carrier density or stronger correlation effect. The plasma frequency
becomes even smaller below $T_{\rm s}$ which agrees with the very small Fermi

  arXiv:1610.07295",,,,"math.AG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We introduce spectral Hirzebruch-Milnor classes for singular hypersurfaces.
These can be identified with Steenbrink spectra in the isolated singularity
case, and may be viewed as their global analogues in general. Their definition
uses vanishing cycles of mixed Hodge modules and the Todd class transformation.
These are compatible with the pushforward by proper morphisms, and the classes
can be calculated by using resolutions of singularities. Formulas for
Hirzebruch-Milnor classes of projective hypersurfaces in terms of these classes
are given in the case where the multiplicity of a generic hyperplane section is
not 1. These formulas using hyperplane sections instead of hypersurface ones
are easier to calculate in certain cases. Here we use the Thom-Sebastiani
theorem for the underlying filtered $D$-modules of vanishing cycles, from which
we can deduce the Thom-Sebastiani type theorem for spectral Hirzebruch-Milnor
classes. For the Chern classes after specializing to $y=-1$, we can give a
relatively simple formula for the localized Milnor classes, which implies a new
formula for the Euler numbers of projective hypersurfaces, using iterated
hyperplane sections. Applications to log canonical thresholds and Du Bois
singularities are also explained; for instance, the latter can be detected by
using Hirzebruch-Milnor classes in the projective hypersurface case.

optimization index on a switching surface generated by control invariant sets.
With the index-switching strategy, stability of the origin is ensured by a
terminal control law. Convergence conditions of the optimal cost to zero are
established taking into account the causal link between the presumed trajectory
and the optimized trajectory of the previous step. The compatibility
constraints preserve the quadratic program property that is desired in
practical applications. It is also observed that the proposed DMPC scheme has
benefits dealing with systems that need to take into account safety-related

changing the micro-motion operator. These corrections conspire to give a
Hall-type linear response for non-stroboscopic (time-averaged) observables
allowing one to measure the Berry curvature and the Chern number related to the
Floquet Hamiltonian, thus extending these concepts to periodically-driven

Thouless energy pump, where one can adiabatically add energy to the system in
discrete units of the driving frequency. We discuss the validity of Floquet
Adiabatic Perturbation Theory (FAPT) using five different models covering
linear and non-linear few and many-particle systems. We argue that in
interacting systems, even in the stable high-frequency regimes, FAPT breaks
down at ultra slow ramp rates due to avoided crossings of photon resonances,
not captured by the inverse-frequency expansion, leading to a counter-intuitive
stronger heating at slower ramp rates. Nevertheless, large windows in the ramp
rate are shown to exist for which the physics of interacting driven systems is
well captured by FAPT.

the basis of multiple incomplete enumerations of individuals. In many
applications, the individual probability of being recorded is heterogeneous in
the population. Previous studies have suggested that it is not possible to
reliably estimate the total population size when capture heterogeneity exists.
Here we approach population estimation in the presence of capture heterogeneity
as a latent length biased nonparametric density estimation problem on the unit
interval. We show that in this setting it is generally impossible to estimate
the density on the entire unit interval in finite samples, and that estimators
of the population size have high and sometimes unbounded risk when the density
has significant mass near zero. As an alternative, we propose estimating the
population of individuals with capture probability exceeding some threshold. We
provide methods for selecting an appropriate threshold, and show that this
approach results in estimators with substantially lower risk than estimators of
the total population size, with correspondingly smaller uncertainty, even when
the parameter of interest is the total population. The alternative paradigm is
demonstrated in extensive simulation studies and an application to snowshoe

even if these directions are not suitable for practical purposes. Here we
present unambiguous experimental evidence in the microwave range that, for a
dimer of HRI spherical particles, a perfect switching effect (perfect means off
= null intensity) is observed out of those directions as a consequence of the
mutual particle electric/magnetic interaction. The binary state depends on the
excitation polarization (polarization switching). Its analysis is performed
through the linear polarization degree of scattered radiation at a detection
direction perpendicular to the incident direction: the beam-splitter
configuration. The scaling property of Maxwell equations allows generalizing
our results to other frequency range and dimension scales, for instance, the
visible and the nanometric scale.

networks. A few of their fundamental parameters have been studied. However,
none of them concerns their spectra. We consider the random hyperbolic graph
model as formalized by [GPP12] and essentially determine the spectral gap of
their normalized Laplacian. Specifically, we establish that with high
probability the second smallest eigenvalue of the normalized Laplacian of the
giant component of and $n$-vertex random hyperbolic graph is
$\Omega(n^{-(2\alpha-1)}/D)$, where $\frac12<\alpha<1$ is a model parameter and
$D$ is the network diameter (which is known to be at most polylogarithmic in

$n^{-(2\alpha-1)}(\log n)^{1+o(1)}$. As a byproduct we conclude that the
conductance upper bound on the eigenvalue gap obtained via Cheeger's inequality
is essentially tight. We also provide a more detailed picture of the collection
of vertices on which the bound on the conductance is attained, in particular
showing that for all subsets whose volume is $O(n^{1-\varepsilon})$ the

transition (AMIT). The typical overlap $F$ between the ground state of a Fermi
liquid and the one of the same system with an added potential impurity is found
to decay at the AMIT exponentially with system size $L$ as $F \sim \exp (-
\langle I_A\rangle /2)= \exp(-c L^{\eta})$, where $I_A$ is the so called
Anderson integral, $\eta $ is the power of multifractal intensity correlations
and $\langle ... \rangle$ denotes the ensemble average. Thus, strong disorder
typically increases the sensitivity of a system to an additional impurity
exponentially. We recover on the metallic side of the transition Anderson's
result that fidelity $F$ decays with a power law $F \sim L^{-q (E_F)}$ with
system size $L$. This power increases as Fermi energy $E_F$ approaches mobility
edge $E_M$ as $q (E_F) \sim (\frac{E_F-E_M}{E_M})^{-\nu \eta},$ where $\nu$ is
the critical exponent of correlation length $\xi_c$. On the insulating side of
the transition $F$ is constant for system sizes exceeding localization length
$\xi$. While these results are obtained from the mean value of $I_A,$ giving
the typical fidelity $F$, we find that $I_A$ is widely, log normally,
distributed with a width diverging at the AMIT. As a consequence, the mean
value of fidelity $F$ converges to one at the AMIT, in strong contrast to its
typical value which converges to zero exponentially fast with system size $L$.
This counterintuitive behavior is explained as a manifestation of
multifractality at the AMIT.

first decompose the long-term age progress into a sequence of short-term
changes and model it as a face sequence. The Temporal Deep Restricted Boltzmann
Machines based age progression model together with the prototype faces are then
constructed to learn the aging transformation between faces in the sequence. In
addition, to enhance the wrinkles of faces in the later age ranges, the wrinkle
models are further constructed using Restricted Boltzmann Machines to capture
their variations in different facial regions. The geometry constraints are also
taken into account in the last step for more consistent age-progressed results.
The proposed approach is evaluated using various face aging databases, i.e.
FG-NET, Cross-Age Celebrity Dataset (CACD) and MORPH, and our collected
large-scale aging database named AginG Faces in the Wild (AGFW). In addition,
when ground-truth age is not available for input image, our proposed system is

and light cones of the Gaussian free field (GFF).
  Recall that (one-sided, chordal, origin-seeded) SLE$_\kappa(\rho)$ processes
are in some sense the simplest and most natural variants of the Schramm-Loewner
evolution. They were originally defined only for $\rho > -2$, but one can use
L\'evy compensation to extend the definition to any $\rho >
-2-\tfrac{\kappa}{2}$ and to obtain qualitatively different curves. The
triangle $T = \{(\kappa, \rho): (-2-\tfrac{\kappa}{2})\vee
(\tfrac{\kappa}{2}-4) < \rho < -2 \}$ is the primary focus of this paper. When
$(\kappa, \rho) \in T$, the SLE$_\kappa(\rho)$ curves are highly non-simple
(and double points are dense) even though $\kappa < 4$.
  Let $h$ be an instance of the GFF. Fix $\kappa\in (0,4)$ and $\chi =
2/\sqrt{\kappa} - \sqrt{\kappa}/2$. Recall that an imaginary geometry ray is a
flow line of $e^{i(h/\chi +\theta)}$ that looks locally like SLE$_\kappa$. The
light cone with parameter $\theta \in [0, \pi]$ is the set of points reachable
from the origin by a sequence of rays with angles in $[-\theta/2, \theta/2]$.
When $\theta=0$, the light cone looks like SLE$_\kappa$, and when $\theta =
\pi$ it looks like the range of an SLE$_{16/\kappa}$. We find that when $\theta
\in (0, \pi)$ the light cones are either fractal carpets with a dense set of
holes or space-filling regions with no holes.
  We show that every non-space-filling light cone (with $\theta \in (0,\pi]$
and $\kappa \in (0,4)$) agrees in law with the range of an SLE$_\kappa(\rho)$
process with $(\kappa, \rho) \in T$. Conversely, the range of any
SLE$_\kappa(\rho)$ with $(\kappa,\rho) \in T$ agrees in law with a
non-space-filling light cone. As a consequence, we obtain the first proof that
these SLE$_\kappa(\rho)$ processes are continuous and show that they are
natural path-valued functions of the GFF.

to estimate expectations of functions f(x), especially in high dimensions.
Control variates are a very powerful technique to reduce the error of such
estimates, but in their conventional form rely on having an accurate
approximation of f, a priori. Stacked Monte Carlo (StackMC) is a recently
introduced technique designed to overcome this limitation by fitting a control
variate to the data samples themselves. Done naively, forming a control variate
to the data would result in overfitting, typically worsening the MC algorithm's
performance. StackMC uses in-sample / out-sample techniques to remove this
overfitting. Crucially, it is a post-processing technique, requiring no
additional samples, and can be applied to data generated by any MC estimator.
Our preliminary experiments demonstrated that StackMC improved the estimates of

fundamental limits by combining plenoptic imaging with an intriguing
correlation remote-imaging technique: ghost imaging. Here, we theoretically
demonstrate that correlation plenoptic imaging can be effectively achieved by
exploiting the position-momentum entanglement characterizing spontaneous
parametric down-conversion (SPDC) photon pairs. As a proof-of-principle
demonstration, we shall show that correlation plenoptic imaging with entangled

on ratios of coupling modifiers. Several interpretations of the measurements
with more model-dependent parameterisations are also given. The combined signal

certain spherical harmonics on the $S^4$ sphere, viz., the vector
representation $\bf5$ of the global $SO(5)$ isometry. They appear, for example,
in the perturbative calculation of the on-shell effective action of dS space,
as well as in models containing matter fields. These modes are shown to be
associated with collective modes of $S^4$ corresponding to certain coherent
fluctuations. When dS space is embedded in flat five dimensions $E^5,$ they may
be seen as a legacy of translation of the center of the $S^4$ sphere. Rigid
translations of the $S^4$-sphere on $E^5$ leave the classical action invariant
but are unobservable displacements from the point of view of gravitational
dynamics on $S^4.$ Thus, unlike similar moduli, the center of the sphere is not
promoted to a dynamical degree of freedom. As a result, these zero modes do not
signify the possibility of physically realizable fluctuations or flat
directions for the metric of dS space. They are not associated with Killing
vectors on $S^4$ but can be with certain non-isometric, conformal Killing forms
that locally correspond to a rescaling of the volume element $dV_4.$
  For convenience, we frame our discussion in the context of renormalizable
gravity, but the conclusions apply equally to the corresponding zero modes in
Einstein gravity. We expect that these zero modes will be present to all orders
in perturbation theory. They will occur for Lorentzian signature as well, so
long as the hyperboloid $H^4$ is locally stable, but there remain certain
infrared issues that need to be clarified. We conjecture that they will appear
in any gravitational theory having dS background as a locally stable solution
of the effective action, regardless of whether additional matter is included.

of state of quarks and gluons arising from the lattice with some natural
requirements for self-gravitating objects at equilibrium: the existence of an
equation of state (namely, the possibility to define the pressure as a function
of the energy density), the absence of superluminal propagation and Le
Chatelier's principle. It is discussed under which conditions it is possible to
extract an equation of state (in the above sense) from the non-perturbative
propagators arising from the fits of the latest lattice data. In the quark
case, there is a small but non-vanishing range of temperatures in which it is
not possible to define a single-valued functional relation between density and
pressure. Interestingly enough, a small change of the parameters appearing in
the fit of the lattice quark propagator (of around 10~\%) could guarantee the
fulfillment of all the three conditions (keeping alive, at the same time, the
violation of positivity of the spectral representation, which is the expected
signal of confinement). As far as gluons are concerned, the analysis shows very
similar results. Whether or not the non-perturbative quark and gluon
propagators satisfy these conditions can have a strong impact on the estimate
of the maximal mass of quark stars.

demonstrably dust producers, but also efficient destroyers of cosmic dust. Dust
destruction in the ISM is believed to be the result of SN shocks hitting the
ambient ISM gas (and dust) and lead to an increased rate of ion sputtering,
which reduces the dust mass. Grains located in cold molecular clouds can on the
other hand grow by condensation, thus providing a replenishment mechanism or
even a dominant channel of dust formation. In dense environments grains may
coagulate and form large composite grains and aggregates and if grains collide
with large enough energies they may be shattered, forming a range of smaller
debris grains. The present paper presents a statistical modelling approach
using the method of moments, which is computationally very inexpensive and may
therefore be an attractive option when combining dust processing with, e.g.,
detailed simulations of interstellar gas dynamics. A solar-neighbourhood-like
toy model of interstellar dust evolution is presented as an example.

different Landau levels with the same value of orbital momentum takes place
leading to the redistribution of the wave function profiles of these sublevels

be very effectively tuned by chemical potential. If the chemical potential is
situated inside a Landau level, then the charge of impurity is strongly

intra-cluster medium of simulated galaxy clusters, extracted from
state-of-the-art cosmological hydrodynamical simulations performed with the
Smoothed-Particle-Hydrodynamic code GADGET-3. These simulations include several
physical processes, among which stellar and AGN feedback, and have been
performed with an improved version of the code that allows for a better
description of hydrodynamical instabilities and gas mixing processes.
Evaluating the radial balance between the gravitational and hydrodynamical
forces, via the gas accelerations generated, we effectively examine the level
of HE in every object of the sample, its dependence on the radial distance from
the center and on the classification of the cluster in terms of either
cool-coreness or dynamical state. We find an average deviation of 10-20% out to
the virial radius, with no evident distinction between cool-core and
non-cool-core clusters. Instead, we observe a clear separation between regular
and disturbed systems, with a more significant deviation from HE for the
disturbed objects. The investigation of the bias between the hydrostatic
estimate and the total gravitating mass indicates that, on average, this traces
very well the deviation from HE, even though individual cases show a more
complex picture. Typically, in the radial ranges where mass bias and deviation
from HE are substantially different, the gas is characterized by a significant
amount of random motions (>~30 per cent), relative to thermal ones. As a
general result, the HE-deviation and mass bias, at given interesting distance
from the cluster center, are not very sensitive to the temperature
inhomogeneities in the gas.

in excess of the Chandrasekhar mass. After the merger, the remnant manifests as
an $L \sim 3 \times 10^4 L_\odot$ source for $\sim 10^4$ yr. A dusty wind may
develop, leading these sources to be self-obscured and to appear similar to
extreme AGB stars. Roughly $\sim 10$ such objects should exist in the Milky Way
and M31 at any time. As found in previous work, off-center carbon fusion is
ignited within the merger remnant and propagates inward via a carbon flame,
converting the WD to an oxygen-neon (ONe) composition. By following the
evolution for longer than previous calculations, we demonstrate that after
carbon-burning reaches the center, neutrino-cooled Kelvin-Helmholtz contraction
leads to off-center neon ignition in remnants with masses $\ge 1.35 M_\odot$.
The resulting neon-oxygen flame converts the core to a silicon WD. Thus,
super-Chandrasekhar WD merger remnants do not undergo electron-capture induced
collapse as traditionally assumed. Instead, if the remnant mass remains above
the Chandrasekhar mass, we expect that it will form a low-mass iron core and
collapse to form a neutron star. Remnants that lose sufficient mass will end up
as massive, isolated ONe or Si WDs.

functions entering the streaming model we use local Lagrangian bias together
with Convolution Lagrangian perturbation theory (CLPT) which constitutes an
approximation to the Post-Zel'dovich approximation. On the basis of N-body
simulations we demonstrate that a smoothing of the initial conditions with the
Lagrangian radius improves the Zel'dovich approximation and its ability to
predict the displacement field of proto-halos. Based on this observation we
implement a ""truncated"" CLPT by smoothing the initial power spectrum and
investigate the dependence of the streaming model ingredients on the smoothing
scale. We find that the real space correlation functions of halos and their
mean pairwise velocity are optimised if the coarse graining scale is chosen to
be 1 Mpc/h at z=0, while the pairwise velocity dispersion is optimised if the
smoothing scale is chosen to be the Lagrangian size of the halo. We compare
theoretical results for the halo correlation function in redshift space to
measurements within the Horizon Run 2 N-body simulation halo catalog. We find
that this simple two-filter smoothing procedure in the spirit of the truncated

liberating energy that might regulate star formation on galaxy-wide scales. The
nature of the gaseous fuel reservoirs that power black hole growth is
nevertheless largely unconstrained by observations, and is instead routinely
simplified as a smooth, spherical inflow of very hot gas. Recent theory and
simulations instead predict that accretion can be dominated by a stochastic,
clumpy distribution of very cold molecular clouds - a departure from the ""hot
mode"" accretion model - although unambiguous observational support for this
prediction remains elusive. Here we report observations that reveal a cold,
clumpy accretion flow towards a supermassive black hole fuel reservoir in the
nucleus of the Abell 2597 Brightest Cluster Galaxy (BCG), a nearby (redshift
z=0.0821) giant elliptical galaxy surrounded by a dense halo of hot plasma.
Under the right conditions, thermal instabilities can precipitate from this hot
gas, producing a rain of cold clouds that fall toward the galaxy's centre,
sustaining star formation amid a kiloparsec-scale molecular nebula that
inhabits its core. The observations show that these cold clouds also fuel black
hole accretion, revealing ""shadows"" cast by the molecular clouds as they move
inward at about 300 kilometres per second towards the active supermassive black
hole in the galaxy centre, which serves as a bright backlight. Corroborating
evidence from prior observations of warmer atomic gas at extremely high spatial
resolution, along with simple arguments based on geometry and probability,
indicate that these clouds are within the innermost hundred parsecs of the
black hole, and falling closer towards it.

hence is suppressed at very low momentum. The indirect detection constraint
from the anisotropy of the Cosmic Microwave Background is usually thought to be

turbulence simulations, the Powell cleaning scheme artificially grows the mean
magnetic field, while CT maintains this conserved quantity of ideal MHD. In the
disc simulation, CT gives slower magnetic field growth rate and saturates to
equipartition between the turbulent kinetic energy and magnetic energy, whereas
Powell cleaning produces a dynamically dominant magnetic field. Such difference
has been observed in adaptive-mesh refinement codes with CT and
smoothed-particle hydrodynamics codes with divergence-cleaning. In the
cosmological simulation, both approaches give similar magnetic amplification,

a random placement of SNe with no CRs. Despite this similarity, CR-driven
outflows differ in several other key properties including their overall
clumpiness and velocity. Moreover, the forces driving these outflows originate
in different sources of pressure, with the CR diffusion model relying on
non-thermal pressure gradients to create an outflow driven by internal pressure
and the random-placement model depending on kinetic pressure gradients to
propel a ballistic outflow. CRs therefore appear to be non-negligible physics
in the formation of outflows from the interstellar medium.

acceleration and emission. Motivated by present experimental constraints and

time-dependent effects from multiple shocks. We produce synthetic light curves
with different variability timescales that stem from properties of the central

neutrino production efficiency, and delays in high-energy gamma rays can be
deduced from inspection of the gamma-ray light curves. GRBs with fast time
variability without additional prominent pulse structure tend to be efficient
neutrino emitters, whereas GRBs with fast variability modulated by a broad
pulse structure can be inefficient neutrino emitters and produce delayed
high-energy gamma-ray signals. Our results can be applied to quantitative tests
of the GRB origin of ultra-high-energy cosmic rays, and have the potential to
impact current and future multi-messenger searches.

to the systematic comparison of public Monte Carlo codes, which describe the
Drell-Yan processes at hadron colliders, in particular at the CERN Large Hadron
Collider (LHC). This work represents an important step towards the definition
of an accurate simulation framework necessary for very high-precision
measurements of electroweak (EW) observables such as the $W$ boson mass and the
weak mixing angle. All the codes considered in this report share at least
next-to-leading-order (NLO) accuracy in the prediction of the total cross
sections in an expansion either in the strong or in the EW coupling constant.
The NLO fixed-order predictions have been scrutinized at the technical level,
using exactly the same inputs, setup and perturbative accuracy, in order to
quantify the level of agreement of different implementations of the same
calculation. A dedicated comparison, again at the technical level, of three
codes that reach next-to-next-to-leading-order (NNLO) accuracy in quantum
chromodynamics (QCD) for the total cross section has also been performed. These
fixed-order results are a well-defined reference that allows a classification
of the impact of higher-order sets of radiative corrections. Several examples
of higher-order effects due to the strong or the EW interaction are discussed
in this common framework. Also the combination of QCD and EW corrections is
discussed, together with the ambiguities that affect the final result, due to
the choice of a specific combination recipe.

and allow novel functionalities in a broad range of applications, from optical
modulation and filtering in integrated photonic circuits to the study of
nonlinear dynamics in arrays of resonators. The Temporal Coupled-Mode Theory
(TCMT) provides a simple and general tool that is widely used to model these
devices and has proved to yield very good results in many different systems of
low-loss, weakly coupled resonators. Relying on TCMT to model coupled
resonators might however be misleading in some circumstances due to the
lumped-element nature of the model. In this article, we report an important
limitation of TCMT related to the prediction of dark states. Studying a coupled
system composed of three microring resonators, we demonstrate that TCMT
predicts the existence of a dark state that is in disagreement with
experimental observations and with the more general results obtained with the
Transfer Matrix Method (TMM) and the Finite-Difference Time-Domain (FDTD)
simulations. We identify the limitation in the TCMT model to be related to the
mechanism of excitation/decay of the supermodes and we propose a correction
that effectively reconciles the model with expected results. A comparison with
TMM and FDTD allows to verify both steady-state and transient solutions of the
modified-TCMT model. The proposed correction is derived from general
considerations, energy conservation and the non-resonant power circulating in
the system, therefore it provides good insight on how the TCMT model should be
modified to eventually account for the same limitation in a different
coupled-resonator design. Moreover, our discussion based on coupled microring
resonators can be useful for other electromagnetic resonant systems due to the
generality and far-reach of the TCMT formalism.

transactions is a challenging problem not just for simulation or emulation but
also for formal. To get designs to work correctly and provide optimal PPA the
designers often use complex optimizations requiring sharing of multiple
resources amongst active threads and transactions using FIFOs, stallers,
pipelining, out-of-order scheduling, and complex layered arbitration. This is
true of most non-trivial designs irrespective of a specific application domain
such as CPU, GPU or communication. At the outset a lot of these application
domains look diverse and complex; however at some level of detail all of these
employ common design principles of sequencing, load balancing, arbitration and
hazard prevention. We present in this paper a key abstraction based methodology
for verifying ordering correctness and arbitration across a range of designs
which are derived from different application domains. We show how by using
abstractions and supporting them with invariants one can not only find deep
corner case bugs in sequentially very deep designs; we can also build
exhaustive proofs to prove the absence of critical bugs such as deadlock,
starvation, and loss of data integrity. We present experimental results on a
range of different designs and show that on some of the designs such as FIFOs
we can verify over 100 different types of FIFOs for ordering correctness using
a single assertion in a single testbench. We also show how the methodology of
FIFO verification can be adapted to verify over half-a-dozen different types of
arbiters including a very complex memory subsystem arbiter. We verify a
multi-clocked synchronizer and a packet based design from a networking domain
using the same abstraction as used in FIFO verification. The results
demonstrate the strength of our methodology which is both reusable and compact.

locally optimized registration method that directly predicts the location of a

non-smooth local deformations in region topology. Our method outperforms the
two most commonly used alternatives (anatomical landmark-based AFNI alignment

collapse due to self-gravity. In the most basic analyses of gravitational
stability, the competition between self-gravity and thermal pressure sets the
critical (i.e. maximum stable) mass of spheres and the critical line density of
cylinders. Previous work has considered additional support from magnetic fields
and turbulence. Here, we consider the effects of non-ionizing radiation,
specifically the inward radiation pressure force that acts on dense structures
embedded in an isotropic radiation field. Using hydrostatic, isothermal models,
we find that irradiation lowers the critical mass and line density for
gravitational collapse, and can thus act as a trigger for star formation. For
structures with moderate central densities, $\sim10^3$ cm$^{-3}$, the
interstellar radiation field in the Solar vicinity has an order unity effect on
stability thresholds. For more evolved objects with higher central densities, a
significant lowering of stability thresholds requires stronger irradiation, as
can be found closer to the Galactic center or near stellar associations. Even
when strong sources of ionizing radiation are absent or extincted, our study
shows that interstellar irradiation can significantly influence the star
formation process.

Only three variable are known afterwards, namely, indenter shape, plus load and

determination of the material properties is the very aim of the test; two
equations are needed to obtain a mathematically solvable system.
  For elastic materials, the contact size can always be eliminated once and for
all in favor of the depth; a single relation between load, depth and material

  For viscoelastic materials where hereditary integrals model the constitutive
behavior, the relation between depth and contact size usually depends also on
the (time-dependent) properties of the material. Solving the inverse problem,
i.e., determining the material properties from the experimental data, therefore
needs both equations. Extending Sneddon's analysis of the indentation problem

extrapolating the observed rate for novae reaching $m\leq2$ to include the
entire Galaxy using a two component disk plus bulge model for the distribution
of stars in the Milky Way. The present analysis improves on previous work by
considering important corrections for incompleteness in the observed rate of
bright novae and by employing a Monte Carlo analysis to better estimate the
uncertainty in the derived nova rates. Several models are considered to account
for differences in the assumed properties of bulge and disk nova populations
and in the absolute magnitude distribution. The simplest models, which assume
uniform properties between bulge and disk novae, predict Galactic nova rates of
$\sim$50 to in excess of 100 per year, depending on the assumed incompleteness
at bright magnitudes. Models where the disk novae are assumed to be more
luminous than bulge novae are explored, and predict nova rates up to 30% lower,
in the range of $\sim$35 to $\sim$75 per year. An average of the most plausible
models yields a rate of $50_{-23}^{+31}$ yr$^{-1}$, which is arguably the best
estimate currently available for the nova rate in the Galaxy. Virtually all
models produce rates that represent significant increases over recent
estimates, and bring the Galactic nova rate into better agreement with that
expected based on comparison with the latest results from extragalactic
surveys.

that number was doubled (~ 72%) when using a generous criterion (NUV - r' \leq

attracting and repelling manifolds of limit cycles of the fast subsystem. A
relatively new dynamic phenomenon, torus canards have been found in neural
applications to mediate the transition from spiking to bursting via
amplitude-modulated spiking. In $\mathbb{R}^3$, torus canards are degenerate:
they require one-parameter families of 2-fast/1-slow systems in order to be
observed and even then, they only occur on exponentially thin parameter
intervals. The addition of a second slow variable unfolds the torus canard
phenomenon, making them generic and robust. That is, torus canards in slow/fast
systems with (at least) two slow variables occur on open parameter sets. So
far, generic torus canards have only been studied numerically, and their
behaviour has been inferred based on averaging and canard theory. This
approach, however, has not been rigorously justified since the averaging method
breaks down near a fold of periodics, which is exactly where torus canards
originate. In this work, we combine techniques from Floquet theory, averaging
theory, and geometric singular perturbation theory to show that the average of
a torus canard is a folded singularity canard. In so doing, we devise an
analytic scheme for the identification and topological classification of torus
canards in $\mathbb{R}^4$. We demonstrate the predictive power of our results
in a model for intracellular calcium dynamics, where we explain the mechanisms
underlying a novel class of elliptic bursting rhythms, called
amplitude-modulated bursting, by constructing the torus canard analogues of
mixed-mode oscillations. We also make explicit the connection between our
results here with prior studies of torus canards and torus canard explosion in
$\mathbb{R}^3$, and discuss how our methods can be extended to slow/fast
systems of arbitrary (finite) dimension.

instruments on board, including the Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (HMI).
Since beginning normal operations on 1 May 2010, HMI has observed the Sun's
entire visible disk almost continuously. HMI collects sequences of polarized
filtergrams taken at a fixed cadence with two 4096 x 4096 cameras from which
are computed arcsecond-resolution maps of photospheric observables: the
line-of-sight (LoS) velocity and magnetic field, continuum intensity, line
width, line depth, and the Stokes polarization parameters, I Q U V, at 6
wavelengths. Two processing pipelines implemented at the SDO Joint Science
Operations Center (JSOC) at Stanford University compute observables from
calibrated Level-1 filtergrams. One generates LoS quantities every 45s, and the
other, primarily for the vector magnetic field, computes averages on a 720s
cadence. Corrections are made for static and temporally changing CCD
characteristics, bad pixels, image alignment and distortion, polarization
irregularities, filter-element uncertainty and non-uniformity, as well as
Sun-spacecraft velocity. This report explains issues affecting the resulting
physical quantities, describes the impact of regular updates to the instrument
calibration, and shows how the computations are optimized for actual HMI
observations. During the 5 years of the SDO prime mission, regular calibration
sequences have been used to regularly improve and update the instrument
calibration and to monitor instrument changes. The instrument more than
satisfies the original specifications for data quality and continuity. The
procedures described here still have significant room for improvement. The most
significant remaining systematic errors are associated with the spacecraft
orbital velocity.

is introduced. Specifically, ${\hat\beta}_t(G)$ is the largest, overall
$t$-shallow minors $H$ of $G$, of the smallest number of cliques that can cover
any closed neighborhood of a vertex in $H$. We verify that ${\hat\beta}_t(G)=1$

we detected significant concentration of phase across trials at the specific
frequency of speech production. We also observed amplitude modulations. In
addition we found significant coupling between the phase of brain oscillations
at the frequency of speech production and their amplitude in the high-gamma
range (i.e., phase-amplitude coupling, PAC). Furthermore, we saw that brain
oscillations at the frequency of speech production organized as traveling waves
(TWs), synchronized to the rhythm of speech production. It has been
hypothesized that PAC is a mechanism to allow low-frequency oscillations to
synchronize with high-frequency neural activity so that spiking occurs at
behaviorally relevant times. If this hypothesis is true, when PAC coexists with
TWs, we expect a specific organization of PAC curves. We observed this
organization experimentally and verified that the peaks of high-gamma
oscillations, and therefore spiking, occur at the same times across electrodes.
Importantly, we observed that these spiking times were synchronized with the
rhythm of speech production. To our knowledge, this is the first report of
motor actions organizing (a) the phase coherence of low-frequency brain
oscillations, (b) the coupling between the phase of these oscillations and the
amplitude of high-frequency oscillations, and (c) TW. It is also the first
demonstration that TWs induce an organization of PAC so that spiking across

to a particular mobile node (called broker node) over the network, based on the
hash value of this ticket. The user will query the broker to get the response.
All parts of the messages are encrypted except the fields required for the

selection, in clients locally and independently choose paths. As a result,
network resources may be left idle, leaving the system in a suboptimal state.
This is referred to as the price of anarchy, where agents acting in their own
self interest can make poor decisions when viewed in a global context. In this
paper we explore the cost of anarchy in Tor by examining the potential
performance increases that can be gained by centrally optimizing circuit and
relay selection using global knowledge. In experiments with both offline and
online algorithms, we show that centrally coordinated clients can achieve up to
75% higher bandwidth compared to traditional Tor. Drawing on these findings, we
design and evaluate a decentralized version of our online algorithm, in which
relays locally distribute information enabling clients to make smarter
decisions locally and perform downloads 10-60% faster. Finally, we perform a
privacy analysis of the decentralized algorithm against a passive and active
adversary trying to reduce anonymity of clients and increase their view of the

has spurred a great interest in developing methodologies to control the FDR in
various settings. The majority of existing approaches, however, address the FDR
control for the case where an appropriate univariate test statistic is
available. Modern hypothesis testing and data integration applications, on the
other hand, routinely involve multivariate test statistics. The goal, in such
settings, is to combine the evidence for each hypothesis and achieve greater
power, while controlling the number of false discoveries. This paper considers
data-adaptive methods for constructing nested rejection regions based on
multivariate test statistics (z-values). It is proved that the FDR can be
controlled for appropriately constructed rejection regions, even when the
regions depend on data and are hence random. This flexibility is then exploited
to develop optimal multiple comparison procedures in higher dimensions, where
the distribution of non-null z-values is unknown. Results are illustrated using
simulated and real data.

of enhancing transient performance of entry guidance during bank reversals,
while compensating adverse effects of fast time-varying transient disturbances.
An extended single-input/single-output system is developed in the velocity
domain by means of a dynamic extension technique, and explicitly captures the
trajectory dynamics of angle-of-attack modulation. A normal form for this
extended system is derived for the sake of employing a feedback linearization
controller. Further, the control characteristics of angle-of-attack modulation
is found to be a non-minimum phase behavior under two common conditions in a
near- equilibrium glide flight. Therefore, the issue of angle-of-attack
modulation is formulated as robust output stabilization of the non-minimum
phase system. A disturbance observer-based feedback linearization technique is
used to design a robustly dynamical output-feedback controller for
angle-of-attack modulation, and an internal-state feedback controller for
bank-angle modulation is used to stabilize the unstable internal dynamics.
Numerical simulations are conducted to demonstrate that the performance of the
proposed method of angle-of-attack modulation is enhanced compared to the
existing shuttle method.

thus provides a generalisation of the Bloch picture for the single qubit.
Recently, a monogamy relation for the volumes of steering ellipsoids has been
derived for pure 3-qubit states and shown to be stronger than the celebrated
Coffman-Kundu-Wootters (CKW) inequality. We first demonstrate the close
connection between this volume monogamy relation and the classification of pure
3-qubit states under stochastic local operations and classical communication
(SLOCC). We then show that this monogamy relation does not hold for general
mixed 3-qubit states and derive a weaker monogamy relation that does hold for
such states. We also prove a volume monogamy relation for pure 4-qubit states,
and generalize our 3-qubit inequality to n qubits. Finally, we study the effect
of noise on the quantum steering ellipsoid and find that the volume of any
two-qubit state is non-increasing when the state is exposed to arbitrary local
noise. This implies that any volume monogamy relation for a given class of
multi-qubit states remains valid under the addition of local noise. We
investigate this quantitatively for the experimentally relevant example of
isotropic noise.

modulations, i.e., close ($a<12~R_{\star}$) and large (in terms of radius)
candidates. We modeled their phase-folded light curves with consistent
equations for the three effects, namely, reflection, ellipsoidal and beaming
(known as REB modulations). We provide detailed general equations for the fit
of the REB modulations for the case of eccentric orbits. These equations are
accurate to the photometric precisions achievable by current and forthcoming
instruments and space missions. By using this mathematical apparatus, we find
three close-in {very low-mass companions (two of them in the brown dwarf mass
domain)} orbiting main-sequence stars (KOI-554, KOI-1074, and KOI-3728), and
reject the planetary nature of the transiting objects (thus classifying them as
false positives). In contrast, the detection of the REB modulations and
transit/eclipse signal allows the measurement of their mass and radius that can
provide important constraints for modeling their interiors since just a few
cases of low-mass eclipsing binaries are known. Additionally, these new systems
can help to constrain the similarities in the formation process of the more

that a hole-like band exists in KxFe2-ySe2, which presumably forms a hole-like
Fermi surface. The present study suggests that AFS can be categorized in the
same group as iron arsenides with both hole- and electron-like FSs present.
This result provides a foundation for a comprehensive understanding of the
superconductivity in iron-based superconductors.

  In our model, each agent has a type distribution. In addition, the agent can
commit to a fake distribution and bids consistently and credibly with respect

games in several well-known mechanisms. Our results can be summarized as
follows: (1) the game induced by Myerson's auction under our model is
strategically equivalent to the first price auction under the standard model.
As a consequence, they are revenue-equivalent as well. (2) the second-price
auction yields weakly better revenue than several reserve-based and

induced, sub-lattice-resolved, strongly enhanced intrinsic spin-orbit

orbital gap related to the transfer of the electronic charge from graphene to
XY2 as well. The former allows for external tuning of the band gap in GTMD and
connects the nearest neighbors with spin-flip. On account of the strong SOC,
the system acts as a quantum spin Hall insulator. We introduce the exchange
field (M) in the Hamiltonian to take into account the deposition of Fe atoms on
the graphene surface. The cavalcade of the perturbations yield particle-hole
symmetric bands with an effective Zeeman field due to the interplay of the
substrate induced interactions with RSOC as the prime player. Our graphical

GTMDs like WY2 exhibit band gap narrowing/widening (Moss-Burs-tein(MB)gap
shift)including the spin-polarization inversion(SPI) at finite but low
temperature (T = 1 K) due to the increase in the exchange field (M) at the
Dirac point K. For graphene on MoY2, on the other hand, the occurrence of the
MB-shift and the SPI at higher temperature (T = 10 K) take place as M is
increased at the Dirac point K prime. Finally, there is anti-crossing of
non-parabolic bands with opposite spins around Dirac points. A direct electric
field control of magnetism at the nano-scale is needed here. The magnetic
multi-ferroics, like BiFeO3 (BFO), are useful for this purpose due to the
coupling between the magnetic and electric order parameters.

theory in which both the wavefunction and the process of collapse are regarded

entangling speed of a system reaches a threshold, and the collapse basis is
determined so as to eliminate the entangling speed and to minimize its
increasing rate. Using this theory, we provide answers to the questions of
where and when collapse occurs, how the collapse basis is determined, what
systems are (in other words, what the actual tensor product structure is), and
what determines the observables. We also explain how deterministic classical
dynamics emerges from indeterministic quantum collapse, explaining the
quantum-to-classical transition. In addition, we show that the theory
guarantees energy conservation to a high accuracy. We apply the theory to a
macroscopic flying body such as a bullet in the air, and derive a satisfactory
collapse basis that is highly localized in both position and momentum,
consistent with our everyday observation. Finally, we suggest an experiment

3+1-dimensional Lifshitz backgrounds. We adopt a consistent approach to obtain
the boundary stress tensor from bulk construction, which satisfies the trace
Ward identity associated with Lifshitz scaling symmetry. In particular, the
boundary stress tensor, constructed from the gravitational wave deformed
Lifshitz geometry, is found up to second order in gravitational wave
perturbations. {The result} is compared to its counterpart in free {scalar}

This allows us to relate the boundary values of gravitational waves to the
squeezing parameters of squeezed vacuum states. We find that, in both cases
with $z=1$, the stress tensor satisfies the averaged null energy condition, and
is consistent with the quantum interest conjecture. Moreover, the negative
lower bound on null-contracted stress tensor, which is averaged over time-like
trajectories along nearly null directions, is obtained. We find a weaker

this paper we compare side by side two EEG amplifiers, the consumer grade
OpenBCI and the medical grade g.tec g.USBamp. For this purpose, we employed an
original montage, based on the simultaneous recording of the same set of

simple adapter with a direct connection between the amplifiers and the
electrodes was used. Then, in a second experiment, we attempted to discard any
possible interference that one amplifier could cause to the other by adding
""ideal"" diodes to the adapter. Both spectral and temporal features were tested
-- the former with a workload monitoring task, the latter with an visual P300
speller task. Overall, the results suggest that the OpenBCI board -- or a

effective alternative to traditional EEG devices. Even though a medical grade
equipment still outperforms the OpenBCI, the latter gives very close EEG
readings, resulting in practice in a classification accuracy that may be
suitable for popularizing BCI uses.

The free parameters of the calibration standards are estimated by minimizing a

are demonstrated through simulations, and real measurements are used to
estimate the actual offset delay of a 50-$\mathbf{\Omega}$ calibration load

answer is generally conjectured to be negative, we give a positive answer for
graphs satisfying some negative curvature assumption. Assuming only strict
positivity and finite expectation of the random lengths, we prove that if a
graph X has bounded degree and contains a Morse geodesic (e.g. is
non-elementary Gromov hyperbolic), then almost surely, there exists a
bi-infinite geodesic in first passage percolation on X.

$L^2(\Omega)$ has an orthogonal basis of group characters. An important
problem, connected with the so-called Spectral Set Conjecture (saying that
$\Omega$ is spectral if and only if a collection of translates of $\Omega$ can
partition the group), is the question of whether the spectrality of a product
set $\Omega = A \times B$, in a product group, implies the spectrality of the

result to a wider collection of product sets than those dealt with by Greenfeld

an all-to-all complex random two-body hopping and has been conjectured to be

hole, provided that the holographic duality is true. We introduce a variant of
the SYK model, in which the random two-body hopping is real. This model is
equivalent to the origincal SYK model in the large-$N$ limit. We show that this
model can be created in principle by confining ultracold fermionic atoms into
optical lattices and coupling two atoms with molecular states via
photo-association lasers. This development serves as an important first step
towards an experimental realization of such systems dual to quantum black

high ME coefficients are obtained when ferrites with high magnetomechanical
coupling are used in bilayer ME composites, (ii) the ME behavior in transversal
and longitudinal modes is quite similar, and differences in the shapes of the
ME curves are mainly due the demagnetizing effects, (iii) in the transversal
mode, the magnetic field penetration depends on the ferrite layer thickness and
the ME coefficient is affected accordingly. The two later points are confirmed
by measurements on ME samples and calculations. Performances of the ME
composites made with high magnetomechanical coupling ferrites are compared to
those obtained using Terfenol-D materials in the same conditions of size,
shape, and volume ratio. It appears that a ferrite with an optimized
composition has performances comparable to those obtained with Terfenol-D

simpler. Finally, a ferrite/PZT based ME composite was used as a current

invention, advancement, exaptation and exploitation. Interviews were conducted
with key informants in nine organisations in the Australian Capital Territory.
Results showed that the least used techniques were skunk works and
crowdsourcing. The most used techniques were traditional market research,
brainstorming and design thinking. The Innovation Practice Framework was given
some support, with genius grants being related to invention outcomes, design
thinking with exaptation, traditional R&D with advancement and managerial

As an important component of quantum secure communication, deterministic joint
remote state preparation (DJRSP) could securely transmit a quantum state with

is affected when qubits involved in the protocol are subjected to noise or
decoherence. Taking a GHZ based DJRSP scheme as an example, we study all types
of noise usually encountered in real-world implementations of quantum
communication protocols, i.e., the bit-flip, phase-flip (phase-damping),
depolarizing, and amplitude-damping noise. Our study shows that the fidelity of
the output state depends on the phase factor, the amplitude factor and the
noise parameter in the bit-flip noise, while the fidelity only depends on the
amplitude factor and the noise parameter in the other three types of noise. And
the receiver will get different output states depending on the first preparer's
measurement result in the amplitude-damping noise. Our results will be helpful
for improving quantum secure communication in real implementation.

propagation of current vortices (fluxons) and electromagnetic waves and are
used in various applications within superconductive electronics. Recently, the
Josephson vortex has been proposed as a new superconducting qubit. We describe
a simple method to create a double-well potential for an individual fluxon
trapped in a long elliptic annular Josephson tunnel junction characterized by
an intrinsic non-uniform width. The distance between the potential wells and
the height of the inter-well potential barrier are controlled by the strength
of an in-plane magnetic field. The manipulation of the vortex states can be
achieved by applying a proper current ramp across the junction. The read-out of
the state is accomplished by measuring the vortex depinning current in a small
magnetic field. An accurate one-dimensional sine-Gordon model for this strongly
non-linear system is presented, from which we calculate the position-dependent
fluxon rest-mass, its Hamiltonian density and the corresponding trajectories in
the phase space. We examine the dependence of the potential properties on the
annulus eccentricity and its electrical parameters and address the requirements
for observing quantum-mechanical effects, as discrete energy levels and
tunneling, in this two-state system.

substitutional alloys to semi-ordered phases were studied in a series of
bismuth tellurides. Using angle-dispersive x-ray diffraction, the compounds
Bi4Te5, BiTe, and Bi2Te were observed to form alloys with the disordered
body-centered cubic (bcc) crystal structure upon compression to above 14--19
GPa at room temperature. The BiTe and Bi2Te alloys and the previously
discovered high-pressure alloys of Bi2Te3 and Bi4Te3 were all found to show
atomic ordering after gentle annealing at very moderate temperatures of
~100{\deg}C. Upon annealing, BiTe transforms from the bcc to the B2 (CsCl)
crystal structure type, and the other phases adopt semi-disordered variants
thereof, featuring substitutional disorder on one of the two crystallographic
sites. The transition pressures and atomic volumes of the alloy phases show
systematic variations across the Bi_mTe_n series including the end members Bi
and Te. First-principles calculations were performed to characterize the
electronic structure and chemical bonding properties of B2-type BiTe and to
identify the driving forces of the ordering transition. The calculated Fermi
surface of B2-type BiTe has an intricate structure and is predicted to undergo
three topological changes between 20 and 60 GPa.

of a modified blackbody, also called greybody, which is widely used in
Astrophysics, and in particular in the study of star formation in the
far-infrared/sub-millimeter domain. The research in this area has been greatly
improved thanks to recent observations taken with the Herschel satellite, so
that it became important to clarify the sense of the greybody approximation, to
suggest possible further uses, and to delimi its intervals of validity. First,
we discuss the position of the greybody peak, making difference between the
optically thin and thick regimes. Second, we analyze the behavior of bolometric
quantities as a function of the different greybody parameters. The ratio
between the bolometric luminosity and the mass of a source, the ratio between
the so-called ""sub-millimeter luminosity"" and the bolometric one, and the
bolometric temperature are observables used to characterize the evolutionary
stage of a source, and it is of primary importance to have analytic equations
describing the dependence of such quantities on the greybody parameters. Here
we discuss all these aspects, providing analytic relations, illustrating
particular cases and providing graphical examples. Some equations reported here
are well-known in Astrophysics, but are often spread over different
publications. Some of them, instead, are brand new and represent a novelty in
Astrophysics literature. Finally we indicate an alternative way to obtain,
under some conditions, the greybody temperature and dust emissivity directly
from an observing spectral energy distribution, avoiding a best-fit procedure.

ISM as a molecular cloud with fractal density structure. SNRs are modelled as
spheres of different radius scattered in the modelled ISM. The surface
brightness of the SNRs is calculated from the simple relation $\Sigma \propto
\rho^{0.5}D^{-3.5}$ and also from the parametrized more general form $\Sigma
\propto \rho^{\eta}D^{-\beta_0}$. Our results demonstrate that empirical
$\Sigma-D$ slopes that are steeper than the ones derived from theory, might be
partly explained with the fractal structure of the ambient medium into which
SNRs expand. The slope of the $\Sigma-D$ relation steepens if the density of
the regions where SNRs are formed is higher. The simple geometrical effects
combined with the fractal structure of the ISM can contribute to a steeper
empirical $\Sigma-D$ slopes, especially for older remnants, and this is more
pronounced if $\Sigma$ has a stronger dependence on ambient density.

\emph{hypercritical} accretion process onto the NS thanks to a copious neutrino
emission and the trapping of photons within the accretion flow. We show that
temperatures 1--10~MeV develop near the NS surface, hence electron-positron
annihilation into neutrinos becomes the main cooling channel leading to
accretion rates $10^{-9}$--$10^{-1}~M_\odot$~s$^{-1}$ and neutrino luminosities
$10^{43}$--$10^{52}$~erg~s$^{-1}$ (the shorter the orbital period the higher
the accretion rate). We estimate the maximum orbital period, $P_{\rm max}$, as
a function of the NS initial mass, up to which the NS companion can reach by
hypercritical accretion the critical mass for gravitational collapse leading to
black-hole (BH) formation. We then estimate the effects of the accreting and
orbiting NS companion onto a novel geometry of the supernova ejecta density
profile. We present the results of a $1.4\times 10^7$~particle simulation which

string theory and its field theory limit (ii) an epoch of slow-roll inflation
within a four-dimensional effective field theory and a hierarchy of scales
$M_{inf} < m_{kk} < m_s \lesssim M_{pl}$ that keeps the latter under control,
we derive an upper bound on the amplitude of primordial gravitational waves.
The bound is very sensitive to mild changes in numerical coefficients and the
expansion parameters. For example, allowing couplings and mass-squared
hierarchies $\lesssim 0.2$, implies $r \lesssim 0.05$, but asking more safely
for hierarchies $\lesssim 0.1$, the bound becomes $r \lesssim 10^{-6}$.
Moreover, large volumes -- typically used in string models to keep backreaction
and moduli stabilisation under control -- drive $r$ down. Consequently, any
detection of inflationary gravitational waves would present an interesting but
difficult challenge for string theory.

flow is proposed. The decomposition is based on the projection of the flow to a
helical basis that allows to investigate separately the role of interactions
among modes of different helicity. The proposed formalism is then applied in
large scale numerical simulations of a non-helical and a helical flow, where
the decomposed fluxes are explicitly calculated. It is shown that the total
energy flux can be split in to three fluxes that independently remain constant
in the inertial range. One of these fluxes that corresponds to the interactions
of fields with the same helicity is negative implying the presence of an
inverse cascade that is `hidden' inside the forward cascade. Similar to the
energy flux the helicity flux is also shown that it can be decomposed to two
fluxes that remain constant in the inertial range. Implications of these
results as well possible new directions for investigations are discussed.

disabilities to provide input to devices which empower them to more fully

paradigm for spelling where a set of characters is highlighted and the user is
queried as to whether their target character is in the highlighted set. These
queries are used to traverse a decision tree which successively prunes away
characters until only a single one remains (the estimate). This work seeks a
decision tree which requires the fewest expected queries per decision sequence
(EQPD). In particular, we remove the constraint that the decision tree needs to
be a row-item or group-row-item style tree and minimize EQPD. We pose the
problem as a Huffman code with variable, integer cost and solve it with a mild
extension of Golin's method in ""A dynamic programming algorithm for
constructing optimal prefix-free codes with unequal letter costs"", IEEE
Transactions on Information Theory (1998). Additionally, we model the user on
the query level by their probability of detection and false alarm to derive
their expected performance on the character level given some decision tree. We
perform experiments which show that the min EQPD decision tree (Karp) may
reduce selection times, especially for timed (single switch) switch scanning.

turned into an algorithm for sampling realizations of CRMs or more elaborate

truncate the random series at some threshold resulting in an approximation

of a localized electromagnetic wave trapped in a spatially extended electron
plasma wave. They are organized in families characterized by the number of
nodes $p$ of the vector potential and exist in a continuous range of parameters
in the $\omega-V$ plane, where $V$ is the velocity of propagation and $\omega$
is the vector potential angular frequency. A parametric study shows that the
familiar fully localized relativistic solitons are special members of the
families of partially localized quasi-solitons. Soliton solution branches with
$p>1$ are therefore parametrically embedded in the continuum of quasi-solitons.
On the other hand, geometric arguments and numerical simulations indicate that
$p=0$ solitons exist only in the limit of either small amplitude or vanishing
velocity. Direct numerical simulations of the Maxwell-fluid model indicate that
the $p>0$ quasi-solitons (and embedded solitons) are unstable and lead to wake
excitation, while $p=0$ quasi-solitons appear stable. This helps explain the

have prompted calls for greater efforts toward robust and beneficial AI,
including machine ethics. Recently, roboticists have responded by initiating
the development of so-called ethical robots. These robots would, ideally,
evaluate the consequences of their actions and morally justify their choices.
This emerging field promises to develop extensively over the next years.
However, in this paper, we point out an inherent limitation of the emerging
field of ethical robots. We show that building ethical robots also necessarily
facilitates the construction of unethical robots. In three experiments, we show
that it is remarkably easy to modify an ethical robot so that it behaves
competitively, or even aggressively. The reason for this is that the specific
AI, required to make an ethical robot, can always be exploited to make
unethical robots. Hence, the development of ethical robots will not guarantee
the responsible deployment of AI. While advocating for ethical robots, we
conclude that preventing the misuse of robots is beyond the scope of
engineering, and requires instead governance frameworks underpinned by
legislation. Without this, the development of ethical robots will serve to
increase the risks of robotic malpractice instead of diminishing it.

advances in fully convolutional networks (FCNs) are adapted to overhead data

Modular Dirichlet Energy (MDE) which allows robust and flexible analysis of the

connectivity in the Bind condition is less integrated with the global network
than in the Shape condition in occipital and frontal modules during the
encoding period of the right screen condition. Using MDE we are able to discern
driving effects in the occipital module between 100-140ms, coinciding with the
P100 visually evoked potential, followed by a driving effect in the frontal
module between 140-180ms, suggesting that the differences found constitute an
information processing difference between these modules. This provides
temporally precise information over a heterogeneous population in promising

Riemannian manifolds. By constructing new trial functions, we obtain a sharp
upper bound of the gap of the consecutive eigenvalues in the sense of the
order, which affirmatively answers to a conjecture proposed by Chen-Zheng-Yang.
In addition, we also exploit the closed eigenvalue problem of Laplacian and
obtain a similar optimal upper bound. As some important examples, we
investigate the eigenvalues of the eigenvalue problem of the Laplacian on the
unit sphere and cylinder, compact homogeneous Riemannian manifolds without
boundary, connected bounded domain and compact complex hypersurface without
boundary in the standard complex projective space $\mathbb{C}P^{n}(4)$ with
holomorphic sectional curvature $4$, and some intrinsic estimates for the
eigenvalue gap is obtained. As the author know, for the Dirichlet problem, the
gap $\lambda_{k+1}-\lambda_{k}$ is bounded by the first $k$-th eigenvalues in
the previous literatures. However, by a large number of numerical calculations,
the author surprisingly find that the gap of the consecutive eigenvalues of the
Dirichlet problem on the $n$-dimensional Euclidean space $R^{n}$ can be bounded
only by the first two eigenvalues. Therefore, we venture to conjecture that all
of the eigenvalues satisfy: $\lambda_{k+1}-\lambda_{k}\leq
\mathfrak{S}_{i}(\Omega)(\lambda_{2}-\lambda_{1})k^{1/n}$, where
$\mathfrak{S}_{i}(\Omega),i=1,2$ denote the first shape coefficient and the
second shape coefficient. In particular, if we consider the second shape
coefficient, then there is a close connection between this universal inequality
and the famous Panye-P\'olya-Weinberger conjecture in general form. By
calculating some important examples, we adduce some good evidence on the
correctness of this conjecture.

  SDNFV proposes a hierarchical control framework where decisions are made
across the SDN controller, a host-level manager, and individual VMs to best
exploit state available at each level. This increases the network's flexibility
compared to existing SDNs where controllers often make decisions solely based
on the first packet header of a flow. SDNFV intelligently places network
services across hosts and connects them in sequential and parallel chains,
giving both the SDN controller and individual network functions the ability to
enhance and update flow rules to adapt to changing conditions. Our prototype
demonstrates how to efficiently and flexibly reroute flows based on data plane

its Lagrangian depends on one dimensionless coupling constant lambda. For the
particular value lambda = 1/3 the kinetic term becomes conformal invariant,
although the full Lagrangian does not have this symmetry. For any value of
lambda the nonprojectable version of the theory has second-class constraints
which play a central role in the process of quantization. Here we study the
complete nonprojectable theory, including the Blas-Pujolas-Sibiryakov
interacting terms, at the kinetic-conformal point lambda = 1/3. The generic
counting of degrees of freedom indicates that this theory propagates the same
physical degrees of freedom of General Relativity. We analyze this point
rigorously taking into account all the z=1,2,3 terms that contribute to the
action describing quadratic perturbations around the Minkowski spacetime. We
show that the constraints of the theory and equations determining the Lagrange
multipliers are strongly elliptic partial differential equations, an essential
condition for a constrained phase-space structure in field theory. We show how
their solutions lead to the two independent tensorial physical modes propagated
by the theory. We also obtain the reduced Hamiltonian. These arguments
strengthen the consistency of the theory. We find the restrictions on the space
of coupling constants to ensure the positiveness of the reduced Hamiltonian. We
obtain the propagator of the physical modes, showing that there are not ghosts
and that the propagator effectively acquires the z=3 scaling for all physical
degrees of freedom at the high energy regime. By evaluating the superficial
degree of divergence, taking into account the second-class constraints, we show
that the theory is power-counting renormalizable. ...

relevant for ultrathin ferromagnetic films with perpendicular anisotropy we
confirm the presence of inverse symmetry breaking from a modulated phase to a
homogenous one as the temperature is lowered at constant magnetic field, as
reported in experiments. For other values of the competing interactions we show
that reentrance may be absent. Comparing thermodynamic quantities in both

suppression of domain wall degrees of freedom at low temperatures at constant

data available for the longitudinal structure function in particular. Here we
present separated structure functions for hydrogen and deuterium at low

distribution parameterizations and a k_T factorization approach. While
differences are found, the parameterizations generally agree with the data even
at the very low Q^2 scale of the data. The deuterium data show a smaller
longitudinal structure function, and smaller ratio of longitudinal to
transverse cross section R, than the proton. This suggests either an unexpected
difference in R for the proton and neutron or a suppression of the gluonic

analyzing the data from GNSS satellites. There are many reports about TEC
anomalies after earthquakes, i.e. large earthquakes often disturb the
ionosphere. Up to now, preseismic TEC anomalies have been reported in several
papers. However, they are not so clear as coseismic TEC anomalies, and their
analysis methods have some problems for practical earthquake prediction. One
factor making it difficult to detect TEC anomalies is large noises in TEC data.
Non-negligible TEC disturbances are caused by many natural mechanisms. To
overcome this difficulty, we propose correlation analyses between one GNSS
station and GNSS stations surrounding it. First, we model TEC time series over
a few hours using polynomial functions of time. Second, we calculate prediction
errors as the departure of the TEC time series from the models over time scale
of a few minutes, and define it as the TEC anomaly. Third, we calculate the
correlation between anomaly of one GNSS station and those at the surrounding
stations. Although such a correlation method has long been used for radio
communications, in particular for spread spectrum communications and very long
baseline interferometry (VLBI) to increase SNR (signal to noise ratio), it has
not been widely applied for TEC analyses. As a result of our method, we
demonstrate that the correlation analysis let us detect TEC anomaly one hour
before 2011 Tohoku-oki earthquake. In this paper, we examined the 2011
Tohoku-oki case extensively.

Within the framework of classical thin plate theory, the stiffness of thin
sheets is independent of its bending state. This assumption, however, goes
against intuition. Simple experiments with a cantilever sheet made of paper
show that the cantilever stiffness largely increases with the transversal
curvature. We here demonstrate by using simple geometric arguments that thin
sheets subject to two-dimensional bending necessarily develop internal
stresses. The coupling between the internal stresses and the bending moments
can increase the stiffness of the plate by several times. We develop a theory
that describes the stiffness of curved thin sheets with simple equations in
terms of the longitudinal and transversal curvatures. The theory perfectly fits
experimental results with a macroscopic cantilever sheet as well as numerical
simulations by the finite element method. The results shed new light on plant

metaheuristic algorithms which was inspired from the vortical flow of the

the solution of certain optimization problems, it also has some drawbacks. In
the VS algorithm, candidate solutions are generated around the current best
solution by using a Gaussian distribution at each iteration pass. This provides
simplicity to the algorithm but it also leads to some problems along.
Especially, for the functions those have a number of local minimum points, to
select a single point to generate candidate solutions leads the algorithm to
being trapped into a local minimum point. Due to the adaptive step-size
adjustment scheme used in the VS algorithm, the locality of the created
candidate solutions is increased at each iteration pass. Therefore, if the
algorithm cannot escape a local point as quickly as possible, it becomes much
more difficult for the algorithm to escape from that point in the latter
iterations. In this study, a modified Vortex Search algorithm (MVS) is proposed
to overcome above mentioned drawback of the existing VS algorithm. In the MVS
algorithm, the candidate solutions are generated around a number of points at
each iteration pass. Computational results showed that with the help of this
modification the global search ability of the existing VS algorithm is improved

observations, and it can serve as a candidate for modified gravity.

Friedmann-Lemaitre-Robertson-Walker metric has been investigated with
Bekenstein entropy and Hawking temperature on the horizon, and Unruh
temperature for the fluid inside the horizon. This temperature is experienced
by a radial comoving observer infinitesimally close to the horizon due to the
pressure exerted by the fluid bounded by the horizon. An expression for the
entropy of the fluid has been obtained which is found to be proportional to the
volume of the thermodynamic system which implies that the Unruh temperature of
the fluid is inconsistent with the holographic principle. Further, we have been
able to find an expression for the effective entropy of the system. Finally,
assuming a barotropic equation of state $p=w\rho$ ($w$ constant) for the fluid,
it has been shown that the generalized second law holds good for a non-phantom
w, while thermodynamic equilibrium is never possible for such a scenario.

star crust, conjectured by Anderson and Itoh in 1975 to be at the heart vortex
creep and the cause of glitches, has been a long-standing question in
astrophysics. Using a qualitatively new approach, we follow the dynamics as
superfluid vortices move in response to the presence of ""nuclei"" (nuclear
defects in the crust). The resulting motion is perpendicular to the force,
similar to the motion of a spinning top when pushed. We show that nuclei repel
vortices in the neutron star crust, and characterize the force as a function of
the vortex-nucleus separation.

abstract framework for modelling processes of many kinds. In this paper, we
concentrate on sequential and parallel decomposability of processes in the
framework of monoidal categories: We will give a precise definition, what it
means for processes to be decomposable. Moreover, through examples, we argue
that viewing parallel processes as coupled in this framework can be seen as a
category mistake or a misinterpretation. We highlight the suitability of
category theory for a structuralistic interpretation of mathematical modelling
and argue that for appliers of mathematics, such as engineers, there is a
pragmatic advantage from this.

(CCs) can be magnetized to become trapped field magnets (TFMs). The magnetic
fields of such TFMs can break the limitation of conventional magnets (<2 T), so
they show potential for improving the performance of many electrical
applications that use permanent magnets like rotating machines. Towards
practical or commercial use of TFMs, effective in situ magnetization is one of
the key issues. The pulsed field magnetization (PFM) is among the most
promising magnetization methods in virtue of its compactness, mobility and low
cost. However, due to the heat generation during the magnetization, the trapped
field and flux acquired by PFM usually cannot achieve the full potential of a
sample (acquired by the field cooling or zero field cooling method). The
multi-pulse technique was found to effectively improve the trapped field by PFM
in practice. In this work, a systematic study on the PFM with successive pulses
is presented. A 2D electromagnetic-thermal coupled model with comprehensive
temperature dependent parameters is used to simulate a stack of CCs magnetized
by successive magnetic pulses. An overall picture is built to show how the
trapped field and flux evolve with different pulse sequences and the evolution
patterns are analyzed. Based on the discussion, an operable magnetization
strategy of PFM with successive pulses is suggested to provide more trapped
field and flux. Finally, experimental results of a stack of CCs magnetized by
typical pulse sequences are presented for demonstration.
