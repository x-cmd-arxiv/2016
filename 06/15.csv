  Classification","version update: correcting typos, incorporating external feedback",,,,"cs.CR cs.LG cs.NE","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Deep neural networks, like many other machine learning models, have recently
been shown to lack robustness against adversarially crafted inputs. These
inputs are derived from regular inputs by minor yet carefully selected
perturbations that deceive machine learning models into desired
misclassifications. Existing work in this emerging field was largely specific
to the domain of image classification, since the high-entropy of images can be
conveniently manipulated without changing the images' overall visual
appearance. Yet, it remains unclear how such attacks translate to more
security-sensitive applications such as malware detection - which may pose
significant challenges in sample generation and arguably grave consequences for
failure.
  In this paper, we show how to construct highly-effective adversarial sample
crafting attacks for neural networks used as malware classifiers. The
application domain of malware classification introduces additional constraints
in the adversarial sample crafting problem when compared to the computer vision
domain: (i) continuous, differentiable input domains are replaced by discrete,
often binary inputs; and (ii) the loose condition of leaving visual appearance
unchanged is replaced by requiring equivalent functional behavior. We
demonstrate the feasibility of these attacks on many different instances of
malware classifiers that we trained using the DREBIN Android malware data set.
We furthermore evaluate to which extent potential defensive mechanisms against
adversarial crafting can be leveraged to the setting of malware classification.
While feature reduction did not prove to have a positive impact, distillation
and re-training on adversarially crafted samples show promising results.

describing this process as (2+1) resonantly enhanced multi-photon ionization is
constructed, which consists of two-photon photoselection from randomly oriented
molecules and successive one-photon ionisation of the photoselected molecules.
It combines perturbation theory for the light-matter interaction with ab initio
calculations for the two-photon absorption and a single-center expansion of the
photoelectron wavefunction in terms of hydrogenic continuum functions. It is
verified that the model correctly reproduces the basic symmetry behavior

found, for which a sufficient d wave character of the electronically excited
intermediate state is crucial.

deflection angle can be freely increased by increasing the crystal length. This

high degrees of heterogeneity in permeability and viscosity. By using the

impediment for them from ever reaching extreme dimensions. Large computer
systems in general, and data centers in particular, will ultimately be managed
using predictive computational and executable models obtained through
data-science tools, and at that point, the intervention of humans will be
limited to setting high-level goals and policies rather than performing
low-level operations. Data-driven autonomics, where management and control are
based on holistic predictive models that are built and updated using live data,
opens one possible path towards limiting the role of operators in data centers.
In this paper, we present a data-science study of a public Google dataset
collected in a 12K-node cluster with the goal of building and evaluating
predictive models for node failures. Our results support the practicality of a
data-driven approach by showing the effectiveness of predictive models based on
data found in typical data center logs. We use BigQuery, the big data SQL
platform from the Google Cloud suite, to process massive amounts of data and
generate a rich feature set characterizing node state over time. We describe
how an ensemble classifier can be built out of many Random Forest classifiers
each trained on these features, to predict if nodes will fail in a future
24-hour window. Our evaluation reveals that if we limit false positive rates to
5%, we can achieve true positive rates between 27% and 88% with precision
varying between 50% and 72%.This level of performance allows us to recover
large fraction of jobs' executions (by redirecting them to other nodes when a
failure of the present node is predicted) that would otherwise have been wasted
due to failures. [...]

accurately than a mixture model applied to the random and fixed variables

states (PLS) are stationary solutions that incorporate the emergence of partial
synchrony when the interaction strength increases. While PLS have long been
considered, existing results on their stability are limited to neutral
stability of the linearized dynamics in strong topology, or to specific
invariant subspaces (obtained via the so-called Ott-Antonsen (OA) ansatz) with
specific frequency distributions for the oscillators. In the mean field limit,
the Kuramoto model shows various ingredients of the Landau damping mechanism in
the Vlasov equation. This analogy has been a source of inspiration for
stability proofs of regular Kuramoto equilibria. Besides, the major
mathematical issue with PLS asymptotic stability is that these states consist
of heterogeneous and singular measures. Here, we establish an explicit
criterion for their spectral stability and we prove their local asymptotic
stability in weak topology, for a large class of analytic frequency marginals.
The proof strongly relies on a suitable functional space that contains (Fourier
transforms of) singular measures, and for which the linearized dynamics is well
under control. For illustration, the stability criterion is evaluated in some
standard examples. We show in particular that no loss of generality results in
assuming the OA ansatz. To our best knowledge, our result provides the first
proof of Landau damping to heterogeneous and irregular equilibria, in absence
of dissipation.

scientific conclusions being drawn from results caused by subjective choices in
algorithms rather than the true nature of the Sun. In this paper, we explore
the effect of the arbitrary thresholds used in the GOES (Geostationary

significant relationship between the power law exponent of the GOES flare peak
flux frequency distribution and the flare start thresholds of the algorithms.
We also find that the power law exponents of these distributions are not
stable, but appear to steepen with increasing peak flux. This implies that the
observed flare size distribution may not be a power law at all. We show that
depending on the true value of the exponent of the flare size distribution,
this deviation from a power law may be due to flares missed by the flare
detection algorithms. However, it is not possible determine the true exponent
from GOES/XRS observations. Additionally we find that the PROBA2/LYRA flare
size distributions are artificially steep and clearly non-power law. We show
that this is consistent with an insufficient degradation correction. This means
that PROBA2/LYRA should not be used for flare statistics or energetics unless
degradation is adequately accounted for. However, it can be used to study
variations over shorter timescales and for space weather monitoring.

Supernova remnants are known as sources of galactic cosmic rays for
their non-thermal emission of radio waves, X-rays, and gamma-rays. However, the
observed soft broken power-law spectra are hard to reproduce within standard
acceleration theory based on the assumption of Bohm diffusion and steady-state
calculations. Aims. We point out that a time-dependent treatment of the
acceleration process together with a self-consistent treatment of the
scattering turbulence amplification is necessary. Methods. We numerically solve
the coupled system of transport equations for cosmic rays and isotropic
Alfvenic turbulence. The equations are coupled through the growth rate of
turbulence determined by the cosmic-ray gradient and the spatial diffusion
coefficient of cosmic rays determined by the energy density of the turbulence.
The system is solved on a co-moving expanding grid extending upstream for
dozens of shock radii, allowing for the self-consistent study of cosmic-ray
diffusion in the vicinity of their acceleration site. The transport equation
for cosmic rays is solved in a test-particle approach. Results. We demonstrate
that the system is typically not in a steady state. In fact, even after several
thousand years of evolution, no equilibrium situation is reached. The resulting
time-dependent particle spectra strongly differ from those derived assuming a
steady state and Bohm diffusion. Our results indicate that proper accounting

to minimize the time to train this model on a cluster of commodity CPUs and

batching and data-parallel techniques, throughput can be improved by at least
5.5x over state-of-the-art systems on CPUs. This ensures an end-to-end training
speed directly proportional to the throughput of a device regardless of its
underlying hardware, allowing each node in the cluster to be treated as a black
box. Our second contribution is a theoretical and empirical study of the
tradeoffs affecting end-to-end training time in a multiple-device setting. We
identify the degree of asynchronous parallelization as a key factor affecting
both hardware and statistical efficiency. We see that asynchrony can be viewed
as introducing a momentum term. Our results imply that tuning momentum is
critical in asynchronous parallel configurations, and suggest that published
results that have not been fully tuned might report suboptimal performance for
some configurations. For our third contribution, we use our novel understanding
of the interaction between system and optimization dynamics to provide an
efficient hyperparameter optimizer. Our optimizer involves a predictive model
for the total time to convergence and selects an allocation of resources to
minimize that time. We demonstrate that the most popular distributed deep
learning systems fall within our tradeoff space, but do not optimize within the
space. By doing this optimization, our prototype runs 1.9x to 12x faster than
the fastest state-of-the-art systems.

rate derives bounds for secure transmission when the channel to the

practice and may require exploitation of specialized coding schemes. In this
paper, we employ the concept of directional modulation and follow a signal
processing approach to enhance the security of multi-user MIMO communication
systems when a multi-antenna eavesdropper is present. Enhancing the security is
accomplished by increasing the symbol error rate at the eavesdropper. Unlike
the information-theoretic secrecy rate paradigm, we assume that the legitimate
transmitter is not aware of its channel to the eavesdropper, which is a more
realistic assumption. We examine the applicability of MIMO receiving algorithms
at the eavesdropper. Using the channel knowledge and the intended symbols for
the users, we design security enhancing symbol-level precoders for different
transmitter and eavesdropper antenna configurations. We transform each design
problem to a linearly constrained quadratic program and propose two solutions,
namely the iterative algorithm and one based on non-negative least squares, at
each scenario for a computationally-efficient modulation. Simulation results
verify the analysis and show that the designed precoders outperform the
benchmark scheme in terms of both power efficiency and security enhancement.

different locations in the feeder. Furthermore, we continue the analysis of the
linearized OPF via comparison to results obtained through convex relaxations

the proposed formulation produces control decisions that closely approximate

networking deal with data in high dimensions. Feature selection is typically
employed to select a subset of features which im- proves generalization
accuracy as well as reduces the computational cost of learning the model. One
of the criteria used for feature selection is to jointly minimize the
redundancy and maximize the rele- vance of the selected features. In this
paper, we formulate the task of feature selection as a one class SVM problem in
a space where features correspond to the data points and instances correspond
to the dimensions. The goal is to look for a representative subset of the
features (support vectors) which describes the boundary for the region where
the set of the features (data points) exists. This leads to a joint
optimization of relevance and redundancy in a principled max-margin framework.
Additionally, our formulation enables us to leverage existing techniques for
optimizing the SVM objective resulting in highly computationally efficient
solutions for the task of feature selection. Specifically, we employ the dual
coordinate descent algorithm (Hsieh et al., 2008), originally proposed for
SVMs, for our formulation. We use a sparse representation to deal with data in
very high dimensions. Experiments on seven publicly available benchmark
datasets from a variety of domains show that our approach results in orders of
magnitude faster solutions even while retaining the same level of accuracy

rotational symmetries $O(3)$ of isotropic space to a discrete subgroup, i.e. a
three-dimensional point group. The subgroups form a rich hierarchy and allow
for many different phases of matter with orientational order. Such spontaneous
symmetry breaking occurs in nematic liquid crystals and a highlight of such
anisotropic liquids are the uniaxial and biaxial nematics. Generalizing the
familiar uniaxial and biaxial nematics to phases characterized by an arbitrary
point group symmetry, referred to as \emph{generalized nematics}, leads to a
large hierarchy of phases and possible orientational phase transitions. We
discuss how a particular class of nematic phase transitions related to axial
point groups can be efficiently captured within a recently proposed gauge
theoretical formulation of generalized nematics [K. Liu, J. Nissinen, R.-J.
Slager, K. Wu, J. Zaanen, Phys. Rev. X {\bf 6}, 041025 (2016)]. These
transitions can be introduced in the model by considering anisotropic couplings
that do not break any additional symmetries. By and large this generalizes the
well-known uniaxial-biaxial nematic phase transition to any arbitrary axial
point group in three dimensions. We find in particular that the generalized
axial transitions are distinguished by two types of phase diagrams with
intermediate vestigial orientational phases and that the window of the
vestigial phase is intimately related to the amount of symmetry of the defining
point group due to inherently growing fluctuations of the order parameter. This
might explain the stability of the observed uniaxial-biaxial phases as compared
to the yet to be observed other possible forms of generalized nematic order
with higher point group symmetries.

structure lines in FIR, and in resolved maps of CO emission. Carbon and oxygen
are overabundant in such gas, but it is severely depleted in hydrogen. As a
consequence, its ionisation fraction is remarkably high, suggesting
magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) processes may be important. In particular, the gas
may be subject to the magnetorotational instability (MRI), and indeed recent
modelling of $\beta$ Pictoris requires an anomalous viscosity to explain the
gas's observed radial structure. In this paper we explore the possibility that
the MRI is active in debris-disc gas and responsible for the observed mass
transport. We find that non-ideal MHD and dust-gas interactions play a
subdominant role, and that linear instability is viable at certain radii.
However, owing to low gas densities, the outer parts of the disc could be
stabilised by a weak ambient magnetic field, though it is difficult to
constrain such a field. Even if the MRI is stabilised by too strong a field, a
magnetocentrifugal wind may be launched in its place and this could lead to
equivalent (non-turbulent) transport. Numerical simulations of the vertically
stratified MRI in conditions appropriate to the debris disc gas should be able
to determine the nature of the characteristic behaviour at different radii, and
decide on the importance of the MRI (and MHD more generally) on the evolution
of these discs.

skyrmions are formed in this material. Skyrmions are whirl-like spin vortices
that have received great theoretical interest because of their non-trivial spin
topology and that are also considered as basic entities for new data-storage
technologies. Interestingly, we found that the orbitally ordered phase shows
sizable ferroelectric polarization and that excess spin-driven polarizations
appear in all magnetic phases, including the skyrmion-lattice phase. Hence,
GaV4S8 shows simultaneous magnetic and polar order and belongs to the class of
multiferroics, materials that attracted enormous attention in recent years.
Here, we summarize the existing experimental information on the magnetic,
electronic, and dielectric properties of GaV4S8. By performing detailed
magnetic susceptibility, resistivity, specific heat, and dielectric
experiments, we complement the low-temperature phase diagram. Specifically, we
show that the low-temperature and low-field ground state of GaV4S8 seems to
have a more complex spin configuration than purely collinear ferromagnetic spin
order. In addition, at the structural Jahn-Teller transition the magnetic
exchange interaction changes from antiferromagnetic to ferromagnetic. We also
provide experimental evidence that the vanadium V4 clusters in GaV4S8 can be
regarded as molecular units with spin 1/2. However, at high temperatures
deviations in the susceptibility show up, indicating that either the magnetic
moments of the vanadium atoms fluctuate independently or excited states of the

activity of the ovaries in relation to age. Ovulation had ceased in 50% of
whales over 45 years, and all whales over 55 years old had ovaries classified
as postreproductive. We also calculated a measure of PRLS, known as
postreproductive representation (PrR) as an indication of the effect of
inter-population demographic variability. PrR for the combined sample was 0.14,
whereas the mean of the simulated distribution for PrR under the null
hypothesis of no PRLS was 0.02. The 99th percentile of the simulated
distribution was 0.08 and no simulated value exceeded 0.13. These results
suggest that PrR was convincingly different from the measures simulated under
the null hypothesis. We found morphological and statistical evidence for PRLS
in South African and Japanese pods of false killer whales, suggesting that this
species is the third non-human mammal in which this phenomenon has been
demonstrated in wild populations. Our estimates for PrR in false killer whales
(0.12-0.37) spanned the single values available for the short-finned pilot
whale (0.28) and the killer whale (0.22) and are comparable to estimates for
historical or hunter-gather human populations (0.3-0.47).

2744 (z=0.308). Our strong- and weak-lensing analysis within the central region
of the cluster, i.e., at R<1Mpc from the brightest cluster galaxy, reveals
eight substructures, including the main core. All of these dark-matter halos
are detected with a significance of at least 5sigma and feature masses ranging
from 0.5 to 1.4x10^{14}Msun within R<150kpc. Merten et al. (2011) and
Medezinski et al. (2016) substructures are also detected by us. We measure a
slightly higher mass for the main core component than reported previously and
attribute the discrepancy to the inclusion of our tightly constrained
strong-lensing mass model built on Hubble Frontier Fields data. X-ray data
obtained by XMM-Newton reveal four remnant cores, one of them a new detection,
and three shocks. Unlike Merten et al. (2011), we find all cores to have both
dark and luminous counterparts. A comparison with clusters of similar mass in
the MXXL simulations yields no objects with as many massive substructures as
observed in Abell 2744, confirming that Abell 2744 is an extreme system. We
stress that these properties still do not constitute a challenge to
$\Lambda$CDM, as caveats apply to both the simulation and the observations: for
instance, the projected mass measurements from gravitational lensing and the
limited resolution of the sub-haloes finders. We discuss implications of Abell
2744 for the plausibility of different dark-matter candidates and, finally,
measure a new upper limit on the self-interaction cross-section of dark matter

test whether central black holes may feed at higher rates in gas-rich galaxies,
probing SMBH activity well below the active regime down to Eddington ratios of
~1e-7. We use a combination of radio data from the ALFALFA survey and from the
literature, along with archival X-ray flux measurements from the Chandra X-ray
observatory, to investigate this potential relationship. We construct a sample
of 129 late-type galaxies, with MB<-18 out to 50 Mpc, that have both HI masses
and sensitive X-ray coverage. Of these, 75 host a nuclear X-ray source, a 58%
detection fraction. There is a highly significant correlation between nuclear
X-ray luminosity LX and galaxy stellar mass Mstar with a slope of 1.7+/-0.3,
and a tentative correlation (significant at the 2.8 sigma level) between LX and
HI gas mass MHI. However, a joint fit to LX as a function of both Mstar and MHI
finds no significant dependence on MHI (slope 0.1+/00.3), and similarly the
residuals of LX-LX(Mstar) show no trend with MHI; the apparent correlation
between LX and MHI seems to be entirely driven by Mstar. We demonstrate
quantitatively that these results are robust against X-ray binary
contamination. We conclude that the galaxy-wide cold gas content in these
spirals does not strongly correlate with their low-level supermassive black
hole activity, and suggest fueling is a localized process.

group. We study asymptotic `$N\to\infty$' representation theory of these
quotients (parametrized by $q\in\mathbb{C}^{\times}$) from a perspective of
braided monoidal categories. Using certain idempotent subalgebras in the finite
and affine algebras, we construct infinite `arc' towers of the diagram algebras
and the corresponding direct system of representation categories, with terms
labeled by $N\in\mathbb{N}$. The corresponding direct-limit category is our
main object of studies.
  For the case of the finite TL algebras, we prove that the direct-limit
category is abelian and highest-weight at any $q$ and endowed with braided
monoidal structure. The most interesting result is when $q$ is a root of unity
where the representation theory is non-semisimple. The resulting braided
monoidal categories we obtain at different roots of unity are new and
interestingly they are not rigid. We observe then a fundamental relation of
these categories to a certain representation category of the Virasoro algebra
and give a conjecture on the existence of a braided monoidal equivalence
between the categories. This should have powerful applications to the study of
the `continuum' limit of critical statistical mechanics systems based on the TL
algebra.
  We also introduce a novel class of embeddings for the affine Temperley-Lieb
algebras and related new concept of fusion or bilinear $\mathbb{N}$-graded
tensor product of modules for these algebras. We prove that the fusion rules
are stable with the index $N$ of the tower and prove that the corresponding
direct-limit category is endowed with an associative tensor product. We also
study the braiding properties of this affine TL fusion.

first resolved image of gas emission in the OVI line. Our target, SDSS
J1156+5008, is very compact in the continuum but displays OVI emission to radii
of 23 kpc. The surface brightness profile is well fit by an exponential with a
scale of 7.5kpc. This is ten times the size of the photoionized gas, and we
estimate that 1/6 the total OVI luminosity comes from resonantly scattered
continuum radiation. Spectroscopy - which closely resembles a stacked sample of
archival spectra - confirms the OVI emission, and determines the column density
and outflow velocity from blueshifted absorption. The combination of
measurements enables several new calculations with few assumptions. The OVI
regions fill only ~$10^{-3}$ of the volume. By comparing the cooling time with
the cloud sound-crossing time, the cooling distance with the size, and the
pressure in the OVI and nebular gas, we conclude that the OVI-bearing gas
cannot have been lifted to the scale height at this temperature, and must be
cooling in situ through this coronal temperature regime. The coronal phase
contains ~1% of the ionized mass, and its kinetic energy is currently ~1% of
the budget set by supernova feedback. However a much larger amount of the gas
must have cooled through this phase during the star formation episode. The
outflow exceeds the escape velocity and the gas may become unbound, but it will
recombine before it escapes and become visible to Lyman (and OI) spectroscopy.
The mapping of this gas represents a crucial step in further constraining
galaxy formation scenarios and guiding the development of future satellites.

investigate this property by computing the entanglement entropy, via the
replica trick, in states dual to superpositions of macroscopically distinct
geometries and find it consistent with evaluating the expectation value of the
area operator within such states. However, we find that this fails once the
number of semi-classical states in the superposition grows exponentially in the
central charge of the CFT. Moreover, in certain such scenarios we find that the
choice of surface on which to evaluate the area operator depends on the density
matrix of the entire CFT. This nonlinearity is enforced in the bulk via the
homology prescription of Ryu-Takayanagi. We thus conclude that the homology
constraint is not a linear property in the CFT. We also discuss the existence

steady decline between the first and final observations. We recover four
sources that pass our selection criteria, of which three are cataloged AGN. The
fourth source is offset by $5.8$ arcsec from the center of a galaxy at a

waves (GWs). Its target signals contain two components: the `Earth term' and
the `pulsar term' corresponding to GWs incident on the Earth and pulsar
respectively. In this work we present a Frequentist method for the detection
and localization of continuous waves that takes into account the pulsar term
and is significantly faster than existing methods. We investigate the role of
pulsar terms by comparing a full-signal search with an Earth-term-only search
for non-evolving black hole binaries. By applying the method to synthetic data
sets, we find that (i) a full-signal search can slightly improve the detection
probability (by about five percent); (ii) sky localization is biased if only
Earth terms are searched for and the inclusion of pulsar terms is critical to
remove such a bias; (iii) in the case of strong detections (with
signal-to-noise ratio $\gtrsim$ 30), it may be possible to improve pulsar
distance estimation through GW measurements.

significant. The reduced amount of gas reaching the central regions due to the
presence of b/p bulges could have significant repercussions on the formation of
discy- (pseudo-) bulges, on the amount of nuclear star formation and feedback,
on the fuel reservoir for AGN activity, and on the overall secular evolution of

the X-ray temperature, X-ray luminosity, gas mass, Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (SZ)

the most realistic models, which include AGN feedback, the slopes of the
various mass-observable relations deviate substantially from the self-similar
ones, particularly at late times and for low-mass clusters. The amplitude of
the mass-temperature relation shows negative evolution with respect to the
self-similar prediction (i.e. slower than the prediction) for all models,
driven by an increase in non-thermal pressure support at higher redshifts. The
AGN models predict strong positive evolution of the gas mass fractions at low
halo masses. The SZ flux and $Y_X$ show positive evolution with respect to
self-similarity at low mass but negative evolution at high mass. The scatter
about the relations is well approximated by log-normal distributions, with
widths that depend mildly on halo mass. The scatter decreases significantly
with increasing redshift. The exception is the hydrostatic mass-halo mass
relation, for which the scatter increases with redshift. Finally, we discuss
the relative merits of various hot gas-based mass proxies.

coupled renormalization group equations for both types of fluctuations obtained
from a linear (cartesian) decomposition of the order parameter field.
Discarding the longitudinal fluctuations, the expected
Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless (BKT) phase characterized by a finite stiffness
and an algebraic decay of order parameter correlations is recovered.
Renormalized by transverse fluctuations, the longitudinal mass scales to zero,
so that longitudinal fluctuations become increasingly important for small
momenta. Within our expansion of the effective action, they generate a
logarithmic decrease of the stiffness, in agreement with previous functional
renormalization group calculations. The logarithmic terms imply a deviation
from the vanishing beta-function for the stiffness in the non-linear sigma
model describing the phase fluctuations at three-loop order. To gain further
insight, we also compute the flow of the parameters characterizing longitudinal
and transverse fluctuations from a density-phase representation of the order
parameter field, with a cutoff on phase fluctuations. The power-law flow of the
longitudinal mass and other quantities is thereby confirmed, but the stiffness
remains finite in this approach. We conclude that the marginal flow of the
stiffness obtained in the cartesian representation is an artifact of the
truncated expansion of momentum dependences.

reconstructions with the un-blinded true mass profile of these two clusters are
presented here. Parametric, free-form and hybrid techniques have been deployed

At low--energies such new physics could manifest itself in the form of color

determine a complete set of electroweak invariant dimension--9 operators, and
our analysis supersedes those that only impose $U(1)_{em}$ invariance. Imposing

collider signatures. Prior to imposing electroweak invariance we find a minimal
basis of 24 dimension-9 operators, which is reduced to 11 electroweak invariant
operators at leading order in the expansion in the Higgs vacuum expectation
value. We set up a systematic analysis of the hadronic realization of the
4-quark operators using chiral perturbation theory, and apply it to determine
which of these operators have long-distance pion enhancements at leading order

networks offers significant challenges in storage, transmission and
computational costs. The predominant approach to reducing these costs is based
on performing a linear mapping of the data to a low-dimensional subspace such
that a certain large percentage of the variance in the data is preserved in the
low-dimensional representation. This variance-based subspace approach to
dimensionality reduction forces a fixed choice of the number of dimensions, is
not responsive to real-time shifts in observed traffic patterns, and is
vulnerable to normal traffic spoofing. Based on theoretical insights proved in
this paper, we propose a new distance-based approach to dimensionality
reduction motivated by the fact that the real-time structural differences
between the covariance matrices of the observed and the normal traffic is more
relevant to anomaly detection than the structure of the training data alone.
Our approach, called the distance-based subspace method, allows a different
number of reduced dimensions in different time windows and arrives at only the
number of dimensions necessary for effective anomaly detection. We present
centralized and distributed versions of our algorithm and, using simulation on
real traffic traces, demonstrate the qualitative and quantitative advantages of
the distance-based subspace approach.

masses of 0.21 MJ and 0.17 MJ which are almost half-way between those of
Neptune and Saturn. With radii of 1.31 RJ and 1.13 RJ, these very low density
planets are the two lowest mass planets with radii in excess that of Jupiter.
Comparing with other recent planet discoveries, we find that sub-Saturns
(0.18MJ < Mp < 0.3MJ) and super-Neptunes (0.05MJ < Mp < 0.18MJ) exhibit a wide
range of radii, and their radii exhibit a weaker correlation with irradiation
than higher mass planets. The two planets are both suitable for measuring the
Rossiter-McLaughlin effect and for atmospheric characterization. Measuring the
former effect would allow an interesting test of the theory that star-planet
tidal interactions are responsible for the tendency of close-in giant planets
around convective envelope stars to be on low obliquity orbits. Both planets
fall on the edge of the short period Neptunian desert in the semi-major
axis-mass plane.

transmission line loss as a function of frequency, temperature, and power. Two
common polyimide dielectrics, one conventional and the other photo-definable

not previously reported to our knowledge, was that the dielectric loss tangents
of both polyimides are remarkably low at deep cryogenic temperatures, typically
100$\times$ smaller than corresponding room temperature values. This enables
fairly long-distance transmission of microwave signals without excessive
attenuation and permits usefully high rf power levels to be transmitted without
creating excessive dielectric heating. We observed loss tangents as low as
2.2$\times$10$^{-5}$ at 20 mK. Our fabrication techniques could be extended to
more complex structures such as multiconductor, multi-layer stripline or
rectangular coax, and integrated attenuators and thermalization structures.

it in a non-principal spin state. In such a state, the body experiences
alternating stresses generated by the inertial forces. This yields nutation
relaxation, i.e., evolution of the spin towards the principal rotation about
the maximal-inertia axis. Knowledge of the timescales needed to damp the
nutation is crucial in studies of small bodies' dynamics. In the literature
hitherto, nutation relaxation has always been described with aid of an
empirical quality factor $\,Q\,$ introduced to parameterise the energy
dissipation rate.
  Among the drawbacks of this approach was its inability to describe the
dependence of the relaxation rate upon the current nutation angle. This
inability stemmed from our lack of knowledge of the quality factor's dependence
on the forcing frequency. In this article, we derive our description of
nutation damping directly from the rheological law obeyed by the material. This
renders us the nutation damping rate as a function of the current nutation
angle, as well as of the shape and the rheological parameters of the body. In
contradistinction from the approach based on an empirical $\,Q\,$-factor, our
development gives a zero damping rate in the spherical-shape limit. Our method
is generic and applicable to any shape and to any linear rheological law.
However, to simplify the developments, here we consider a dynamically oblate
rotator with a Maxwell rheology.

fitting linear models to sequential reads of the charge on the detector.
Algorithms that solve this problem have a long history, but can be

appreciable for these detectors in Earth orbit, particularly above the Earth's
magnetic poles and the South Atlantic Anomaly, and on-board reduction routines
must be capable of flagging affected pixels. In this paper we present an
algorithm that generates optimal photocurrent estimates and flags random
transient charge generation from cosmic rays, and is specifically designed to
fit on a computationally restricted platform. We take as a case study the
Spectro-Photometer for the History of the Universe, Epoch of Reionization, and

the susceptibility of near-IR detectors in low earth orbit and build a model

sinks of a trace gas are identified from observations of its mole fraction at
isolated locations in space and time. This is inherently a spatio-temporal
bivariate inversion problem, since the mole-fraction field evolves in space and
time and the flux is also spatio-temporally distributed. Further, the bivariate
model is likely to be non-Gaussian since the flux field is rarely Gaussian.
Here, we use conditioning to construct a non-Gaussian bivariate model, and we
describe some of its properties through auto- and cross-cumulant functions. A
bivariate non-Gaussian, specifically trans-Gaussian, model is then achieved
through the use of Box--Cox transformations, and we facilitate Bayesian
inference by approximating the likelihood in a hierarchical framework.
Trace-gas inversion, especially at high spatial resolution, is frequently
highly sensitive to prior specification. Therefore, unlike conventional
approaches, we assimilate trace-gas inventory information with the
observational data at the parameter layer, thus shifting prior sensitivity from
the inventory itself to its spatial characteristics (e.g., its spatial length
scale). We demonstrate the approach in controlled-experiment studies of methane
inversion, using fluxes extracted from inventories of the UK and Ireland and of
Northern Australia.

are identified from these simulations, which are fracture zone permeability,
well/skin factor, bottom hole pressure, and injection flow rate. The inputs for
ROMs are based on these key sensitive parameters. The ROMs are then used to
evaluate the influence of subsurface attributes on thermal power production
curves. The resulting ROMs are compared with field-data and the detailed
physics-based numerical simulations. We propose three different ROMs with
different levels of model parsimony, each describing key and essential features
of the power production curves. ROM-1 is able to accurately reproduce the power
output of numerical simulations for low values of permeabilities and certain
features of the field-scale data, and is relatively parsimonious. ROM-2 is a
more complex model than ROM-1 but it accurately describes the field-data. At
higher permeabilities, ROM-2 reproduces numerical results better than ROM-1,
however, there is a considerable deviation at low fracture zone permeabilities.
ROM-3 is developed by taking the best aspects of ROM-1 and ROM-2 and provides a
middle ground for model parsimony. It is able to describe various features of
numerical simulations and field-data. From the proposed workflow, we
demonstrate that the proposed simple ROMs are able to capture various complex
features of the power production curves of Fenton Hill HDR system. For typical
EGS applications, ROM-2 and ROM-3 outperform ROM-1.

evidence for mode coupling of the bar and spiral patterns at the overlap of
corotation and inner Lindblad resonances, but the evidence is unreliable and
inconsistent. The results are the most consistent with the bar and spiral

the LCP array representing the tree shape.
  In order to better understand the combinatorics of LCP arrays, we consider
the problem of inferring a string from an LCP array, i.e., determining whether
a given array of integers is a valid LCP array, and if it is, reconstructing
some string or all strings with that LCP array. There are recent studies of
inferring a string from a suffix tree shape but using significantly more

  We provide two main results. (1) We describe two algorithms for inferring
strings from an LCP array when we allow a generalized form of LCP array defined
for a multiset of cyclic strings: a linear time algorithm for binary alphabet
and a general algorithm with polynomial time complexity for a constant alphabet
size. (2) We prove that determining whether a given integer array is a valid
LCP array is NP-complete when we require more restricted forms of LCP array
defined for a single cyclic or non-cyclic string or a multiset of non-cyclic

with the gravitational wave events since named GW150914 and GW151226. In this
paper we provide an overview of the Liverpool Telescope contribution to the
follow-up campaign over this period. Given the hundreds of square degree
uncertainty in the sky position of any gravitational wave event, efficient
searching for candidate counterparts required survey telescopes with large
(~degrees) fields-of-view. The role of the Liverpool Telescope was to provide
follow-up classification spectroscopy of any candidates. We followed candidates
associated with all three alerts, observing 1, 9 and 17 candidates
respectively. We classify the majority of the transients we observed as
supernovae.

perhaps most importantly in excitable electrophysiological tissue where they
are believed to be responsible for pathological conditions such as cardiac
arrhythmias, epileptic seizures and hallucinations. Mathematically, spiral
waves occur as solutions to systems of reaction-diffusion partial differential
equations (RDPDEs) which are frequently used as models for electrophysiological
phenomena. Because of the invariance of these RDPDEs with respect to the
Euclidean group SE(2) of planar translations and rotations, much progress has
been made in understanding the dynamics and bifurcations of spiral waves using
the theory of group-equivariant dynamical systems. In reality however,
Euclidean symmetry is at best an approximation. Inhomogeneities and anisotropy
in the medium of propagation of the waves break the Euclidean symmetry, and can
lead to such phenomena as anchoring and drifting. In this paper, we study the
effects on quasi-periodic meandering spiral waves of a small perturbation which
breaks the continuous SE(2) symmetry, but preserves the symmetry of a regular
square lattice.

nanostructure science that have great potential in future spin-electronic
technology. The study of multiferroic Skyrmions has attracted much interest in
recent years. This article reports magnetic Bloch Skyrmions induced by an
electric driving field in a composite bilayer (chiral-magnetic/ferroelectric
bilayer) lattice. By using the spin dynamics method, we use a classical
magnetic spin model and an electric pseudospin model, which are coupled by a
strong magnetoelectric coupling in the dynamical simulations. Interestingly, we
observe some skyrmion-like objects in the electric component either during the
switching process or by applying a magnetic field, which is due to the
connection between the electric and the magnetic structures.

progress recently, NMT systems only rely on parallel corpora for parameter
estimation. Since parallel corpora are usually limited in quantity, quality,
and coverage, especially for low-resource languages, it is appealing to exploit
monolingual corpora to improve NMT. We propose a semi-supervised approach for
training NMT models on the concatenation of labeled (parallel corpora) and
unlabeled (monolingual corpora) data. The central idea is to reconstruct the
monolingual corpora using an autoencoder, in which the source-to-target and
target-to-source translation models serve as the encoder and decoder,
respectively. Our approach can not only exploit the monolingual corpora of the
target language, but also of the source language. Experiments on the
Chinese-English dataset show that our approach achieves significant
improvements over state-of-the-art SMT and NMT systems.

for secure group messaging. By secure we mean for the actual users i.e.
end-to-end security, as opposed to ""secure"" for irrelevant third parties.
  Our work provides everything needed to run a messaging session between real
users on top of a real transport protocol. That is, we specify not just a key
exchange, but when and how to run these relative to transport-layer events; how
to achieve liveness properties such as reliability and consistency, that are
time-sensitive and lie outside of the send-receive logic that cryptography-only
protocols often restrict themselves to; and offer suggestions for displaying
accurate (i.e. secure) but not overwhelming information in user interfaces.
  We aim towards a general-purpose unified protocol. In other words, we'd
prefer to avoid creating a completely new protocol merely to support
automation, or asynchronity, or a different transport protocol. This would add
complexity to the overall ecosystem of communications protocols. It is simply
unnecessary if the original protocol is designed well, as we have tried to do.
  That aim is not complete -- our full protocol system, as currently
implemented, is suitable only for use with certain instant messaging protocols.
However, we have tried to separate out conceptually-independent concerns, and
solve these individually using minimal assumptions even if other components
make extra assumptions. This means that many components of our full system can
be reused in future protocol extensions, and we know exactly which components
must be replaced in order to lift the existing constraints on our full system.

Bordetella parapertussis, has been on the rise since the 1980s in many
countries. Immunological interactions, such as immune boosting and
cross-immunity between pathogens, have been hypothesised to be important
drivers of epidemiological dynamics. We present a two-pathogen model of
transmission which examines how immune boosting and cross-immunity can
influence the timing and severity of epidemics. We use a combination of
numerical simulations and bifurcation techniques to study the dynamical
properties of the system, particularly the conditions under which stable
periodic solutions are present. We derive analytic expressions for the steady
state of the single-pathogen model, and give a condition for the presence of
periodic solutions. A key result from our two-pathogen model is that, while
studies have shown that immune boosting at relatively strong levels can
independently generate periodic solutions, cross-immunity allows for the
presence of periodic solutions even when the level of immune boosting is weak.
Asymmetric cross-immunity can produce striking increases in the incidence and
period. Our study underscores the importance of developing a better
understanding of the immunological interactions between pathogens in order to
improve model-based interpretations of epidemiological data.

correlation functions yielding the real and imaginary parts of the wave
function, respectively. With such wave function, we show that the classical

FeXII emission shows very small average Doppler redshifts (v_Dop ~3 km/s), as
well as modest non-thermal velocities (with an average ~24 km/s, and the peak
of the distribution at ~15 km/s). The observed distribution of Doppler shifts
appears to be compatible with advanced 3D radiative MHD simulations in which
impulsive heating is concentrated at the transition region footpoints of a hot
corona. While the non-thermal broadening of FeXII 1349.4A peaks at similar
values as lower resolution simultaneous Hinode/EIS measurements of FeXII 195A,
IRIS observations show a previously undetected tail of increased non-thermal
broadening that might be suggestive of the presence of subarcsecond heating
events. We find that IRIS and EIS non-thermal line broadening measurements are
affected by instrumental effects that can only be removed through careful

195.1/1349.4A FeXII intensity ratios and those predicted by the CHIANTI atomic

surfaces. In such cyclic molecules the electronic spin couples to currents
running around the molecule. For odd-fold symmetric molecules (e.g., odd
membered rings) the SOC is highly analogous to the atomic case; but for
even-fold symmetric molecules every angular momentum state can be both raised
and lowered. These differences arise because for odd-fold symmetric molecules
the maximum and minimum molecular orbital angular momentum states are time
reversal conjugates, whereas for even-fold symmetric molecules they are aliases
of the same single state. We show, from first principles calculations, that in
suitable molecules this molecular SOC is large, compared to the energy
differences between frontier molecular orbitals. Finally, we show that, when
electronic correlations are strong, molecular SOC can cause highly anisotropic

i.e., choosing a subset of the pixels of the image that preserves the

implements a form of compressive sensing through emerging imaging sensor
platforms for which the power expense grows with the number of pixels acquired.
Our goal is for the manifold learned from masked images to resemble its full
image counterpart as closely as possible. More precisely, we show that one can
indeed accurately learn an image manifold without having to consider a large
majority of the image pixels. In doing so, we consider two masking methods that
preserve the local and global geometric structure of the manifold,
respectively. In each case, the process of finding the optimal masking pattern
can be cast as a binary integer program, which is computationally expensive but
can be approximated by a fast greedy algorithm. Numerical experiments show that
the relevant manifold structure is preserved through the data-dependent masking
process, even for modest mask sizes.

compact binaries and mergers. Hydrodynamic simulations of the common envelope
interaction between giant stars and their companions are restricted to the
dynamical, fast, in-spiral phase. They find that the giant envelope is lifted
during this phase, but remains mostly bound to the system. At the same time,
the orbital separation is greatly reduced, but in most simulations it levels
off? at values larger than measured from observations. We conjectured that
during the post-in-spiral phase the bound envelope gas will return to the
system. Using hydrodynamic simulations, we generate initial conditions for our
simulation that result in a fall-back disk with total mass and angular momentum
in line with quantities from the simulations of Passy et al. We find that the
simulated fall-back event reduces the orbital separation efficiently, but fails
to unbind the gas before the separation levels off once again. We also find
that more massive fall-back disks reduce the orbital separation more
efficiently, but the efficiency of unbinding remains invariably very low. From
these results we deduce that unless a further energy source contributes to
unbinding the envelope (such as was recently tested by Nandez et al.), all
common envelope interactions would result in mergers. On the other hand,
additional energy sources are unlikely to help, on their own, to reduce the
orbital separation. We conclude by discussing our dynamical fall-back event in
the context of a thermally-regulated post-common envelope phase.

international migration. The migration patterns between England and Wales and
the remaining EU countries are modified according to the possible scenarios of
their future relations. We find that Brexit will accelerate the overall
population ageing and the deepening imbalance between workers and retirees but
reduce the population growth and the fraction of women of reproductive age. In
the alternative scenarios of remaining in the EU these effects will be
partially forestalled by the influx of immigrants from current and prospective

the target person's video and the observer's video can then be used to identify

significantly improves self-search performance over several well-known face

existence of tetraquarks which are degenerate in mass with baryons with the

a unique quark-confining light-front potential for light hadrons including
spin-spin interactions in agreement with the soft-wall AdS/QCD approach and
light-front holography. The mass-squared of the light hadrons can be expressed
as a frame-independent decomposition of contributions from the constituent
kinetic energy, the confinement potential, and spin-spin contributions. The
mass of the pion eigenstate vanishes in the chiral limit. Only one mass
parameter appears; it sets the confinement mass scale, a universal value for
the slope of all Regge trajectories, the nonzero mass of the proton and other
hadrons in the chiral limit, as well as the mass parameter of the pQCD running

matching of the high and low momentum-transfer regimes determines a scale $Q_0$
which sets the interface between perturbative and nonperturbative hadron
dynamics. as well as the factorization scale for structure functions and
distribution amplitudes. This procedure, in combination with the
scheme-independent PMC procedure for setting renormalization scales, can
greatly improve the precision of QCD predictions.

  Distributed Antenna Systems","11 pages, 7 figures",,,,"cs.IT math.IT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Distributed antenna systems (DAS) have been widely implemented in
state-of-the-art cellular communication systems to cover dead spots. Recent
studies have also indicated that DAS have advantages in wireless energy
transfer (WET). In this paper, we study simultaneous wireless information and
power transfer (SWIPT) for a multiple-input single-output (MISO) DAS in the
downlink which consists of arbitrarily distributed remote antenna units (RAUs).
In order to save the energy cost, we adopt energy cooperation of energy
harvesting (EH) and two-way energy flows to let the RAUs trade their harvested
energy through the smart grid network. Under individual EH constraints, per-RAU
power constraints and various smart grid considerations, we investigate a power
management strategy that determines how to utilize the stochastically spatially
distributed harvested energy at the RAUs and how to trade the energy with the
smart grid simultaneously to supply maximum wireless information transfer (WIT)
with a minimum WET constraint for a receiver adopting power splitting (PS). Our
analysis shows that the optimal design can be achieved in two steps. The first
step is to maximize a new objective that can simultaneously maximize both WET
and WIT, considering both the smart grid profitable and smart grid neutral
cases. For the grid-profitable case, we derive the optimal full power strategy
and provide a closed-form result to see under what condition this strategy is
used. On the other hand, for the grid-neutral case, we illustrate that the
optimal power policy has a double-threshold structure and present an optimal
allocation strategy. The second step is then to solve the whole problem by
obtaining the splitting power ratio based on the minimum WET constraint.
Simulation results are provided to evaluate the performance under various
settings and characterize the double-threshold structure.

the exponential generating function has radius of convergence zero, for

decentralized control of networks of discrete-time nonlinear control systems,

epigenetic marks which are alike (either active or inactive). This model
displays a first-order-like transition between a swollen, epigenetically
disordered, phase, and a compact, epigenetically coherent, chromatin globule.
If the self-attraction strength exceeds a threshold, the chromatin dynamics
becomes glassy, and the corresponding interaction network freezes. By modifying
the epigenetic read-write process according to more biologically-inspired
assumptions, our polymer model with recolouring recapitulates the
ultrasensitive response of epigenetic switches to perturbations, and accounts
for multi-domain conformations, strikingly similar to the
topologically-associating-domains observed in eukaryotic chromosomes.

to 1, we recover (a subset of) Kerr black holes for $q=0$ and a family of
rotating boson stars for $q=1$. In the present paper, we explore the
possibility of measuring $q$ for astrophysical black holes with current and
future X-ray missions. We study the iron K$\alpha$ line expected in the
reflection spectrum of such hairy black holes and we simulate observations with
Suzaku and eXTP. As a proof of concept, we point out, by analyzing a sample of
hairy black holes, that current observations can already constrain the scalar
hair parameter $q$, because black holes with $q$ close to 1 would have iron
lines definitively different from those we observe in the available data. We
conclude that a detailed scanning of the full space of solutions, together with
data from the future X-ray missions, like eXTP, will be able to put relevant
constraints on the astrophysical realization of Kerr black holes with scalar
hair.

length substantially exceeds the gyroradius. Although the plasma beta is very
small, electromagnetic effects are retained, but magnetic compressibility can
be neglected. The work of a previous publication (Helander, 2014) is thus
extended to include electromagnetic instabilities, which are of importance in
closed-field-line configurations, where such instabilities can occur at
arbitrarily low pressure. It is found that gyrokinetic instabilities are
completely absent if the magnetic field is homogeneous: any instability must
involve magnetic curvature or shear. Furthermore, in dipole magnetic fields,
the stability threshold for interchange modes with wavelengths exceeding the
Debye radius coincides with that in ideal MHD. Above this threshold, the
quasilinear particle flux is directed inward if the temperature gradient is
sufficiently large, leading to spontaneous peaking of the density profile.

link transmission (only use the direct link to transmit) and the relay assisted
transmission (the source and the relay transmit with equal probability), are
studied, and the corresponding optimal power allocations are obtained. By
transforming two non-convex problems into quasiconcave ones, the closed-form

shown to be a mixed transmission scheme between the direct link transmission

message to any other node in the network. Under the discrete memoryless model,
we prove the strong converse theorem for any network whose cut-set bound is
tight, i.e., achievable. Our result implies that for any fixed rate vector that
resides outside the capacity region, the average error probabilities of any
sequence of length-$n$ codes operated at the rate vector must tend to $1$ as
$n$ approaches infinity. The proof is based on the method of types and is
inspired by the work of Csisz\'{a}r and K\""{o}rner in 1982 which fully
characterized the reliability function of any discrete memoryless channel (DMC)
with feedback for rates above capacity. In addition, we generalize the strong
converse theorem to the Gaussian model where each node is subject to an
almost-sure power constraint. Important consequences of our results are new
strong converses for the Gaussian multiple access channel (MAC) with feedback
and the following relay channels under both models: The degraded relay channel
(RC), the RC with orthogonal sender components, and the general RC with
feedback.

simulation has been introduced by Henzinger, Kupferman and Rajamani. We
contribute to a generalization of fair simulation in two different directions:
one for nondeterministic tree automata previously studied by Bomhard; and the
other for probabilistic word automata with finite state spaces, both under the
B\""{u}chi acceptance condition. The former nondeterministic definition is
formulated in terms of systems of fixed-point equations, hence is readily
translated to parity games and is then amenable to Jurdzi\'{n}ski's algorithm;
the latter probabilistic definition bears a strong ranking-function flavor.

function is confirmed over a long range of baseline lengths, between $1$ and
$80$ km, with a slope that is in general larger than the $5/3$ expected for
pure Kolmogorov turbulence. The measured average slope is $1.89$ with a one
standard deviation spread of $0.1$. The diffractive scale, i.e. the length
scale where the phase variance is $1\, \mathrm{rad^2}$, is shown to be an
easily obtained single number that represents the ionospheric quality of a
radio interferometric observation. A small diffractive scale is equivalent to
high phase variability over the field of view as well as a short time coherence
of the signal, which limits calibration and imaging quality. For the studied
observations the diffractive scales at $150$ MHz vary between $3.5$ and $30\,$
km. A diffractive scale above $5$ km, pertinent to about $90 \%$ of the

numerical results proving that a heavy-hole spin qubit can be reliably

strong Rashba-like spin-orbit interaction terms enabled by the interface
inversion asymmetry. Single qubit rotations rely on electric-dipole spin
resonance (EDSR), which is strongly enhanced by interface-induced spin-orbit

qubit sensitivity to charge noise, we demonstrate that interface-induced

function of the top gate electric field, which are close to maxima in the EDSR
strength, where the EDSR gate has high fidelity. We show that both qubits can

human visual perception that allows individuals to respond to social cues.
Humans are able to identify similar behaviors and discriminate between distinct
actions despite transformations, like changes in viewpoint or actor, that
substantially alter the visual appearance of a scene. This ability to
generalize across complex transformations is a hallmark of human visual
intelligence. Advances in understanding motion perception at the neural level
have not always translated in precise accounts of the computational principles
underlying what representation our visual cortex evolved or learned to compute.
Here we test the hypothesis that invariant action discrimination might fill
this gap. Recently, the study of artificial systems for static object
perception has produced models, CNNs, that achieve human level performance in
complex discriminative tasks. Within this class of models, architectures that
better support invariant object recognition also produce image representations
that match those implied by human and primate neural data. However, whether
these models produce representations of action sequences that support
recognition across complex transformations and closely follow neural
representations remains unknown. Here we show that spatiotemporal CNNs
appropriately categorize video stimuli into actions, and that deliberate model
modifications that improve performance on an invariant action recognition task
lead to data representations that better match human neural recordings. Our
results support our hypothesis that performance on invariant discrimination

to store and share files by hiding all the cryptographic and key-distribution

occupy space. Their evolution cannot be understood by looking at the dynamics
of urban aggregations and transportation systems separately. Instead, existing

meta-agents that represent humans with their different demands for housing and

QFTs, CHI computes $A/4G$ on a certain cut of an event horizon in the
gravitational dual. The result is naturally interpreted as a coarse-grained
entropy for the QFT. CHI is known to be finitely greater than the fine-grained
Hubeny-Rangamani-Takayanagi (HRT) entropy when $\partial R$ lies on a Killing
horizon of the QFT spacetime, and in this context satisfies other non-trivial
properties expected of an entropy. Here we present evidence that it also
satisfies the quantum null energy condition (QNEC), which bounds the second
derivative of the entropy of a quantum field theory on one side of a
non-expanding null surface by the flux of stress-energy across the surface. In
particular, we show CHI to satisfy the QNEC in 1+1 holographic CFTs when
evaluated in states dual to conical defects in AdS$_3$. This surprising result
further supports the idea that CHI defines a useful notion of coarse-grained

the Tc trend on stellar Galactocentric distances, Rmean. We used high-quality
spectra of about 40 stars observed with the HARPS and UVES spectrographs to
derive precise stellar parameters, chemical abundances, and stellar ages. A
differential line-by-line analysis was applied to achieve the highest possible
precision in the chemical abundances. We confirm previous results that [X/Fe]
abundance ratios depend on stellar age and that for a given age, some elements
also show a dependence on Rmean. When using the whole sample of stars, we
observe a weak hint that the Tc trend depends on Rmean. The observed dependence
is very complex and disappears when only stars with similar ages are
considered. To conclude on the possible dependence of the Tc trend on the
formation place of stars, a larger sample of stars with very similar
atmospheric parameters and stellar ages observed at different Galactocentric
distances is needed

(EDFs), which provides a practical description of important correlations at the
ground state. Properties of elementary modes of excitation are strongly
influenced by the symmetry breaking and can be studied with TDDFT. In
particular, a number of recent developments in the linear response calculation
have demonstrated their usefulness in description of collective modes of
excitation in nuclei. Unrestricted real-time calculations have also become
available in recent years, with new developments for quantitative description
of nuclear collision phenomena. There are, however, limitations in the
real-time approach; for instance, it cannot describe the many-body quantum
tunneling. Thus, we treat the quantum fluctuations associated with slow
collective motions assuming that time evolution of densities are determined by
a few collective coordinates and momenta. The concept of collective submanifold
is introduced in the phase space associated with the TDDFT and used to quantize
the collective dynamics. Selected applications are presented to demonstrate the
usefulness and quality of the new approaches. Finally, conceptual differences
between nuclear and electronic TDDFT are discussed, with some recent
applications to studies of electron dynamics in the linear response and under a

  COCOON 2016",,,,"cs.DS","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Recent work by Elmasry et al. (STACS 2015) and Asano et al. (ISAAC 2014),
reconsidered classical fundamental graph algorithms focusing on improving the
space complexity. We continue this line of work focusing on space. Our first
result is a simple data structure that can maintain any subset $S$ of a
universe of $n$ elements using $n+o(n)$ bits and support in constant time,
apart from the standard insert, delete and membership queries, the operation
{\it findany} that finds and returns any element of the set (or outputs that
the set is empty). Using this we give a BFS implementation that takes $O(m+n)$
time using at most $2n+o(n)$ bits. Later, we further improve the space
requirement of BFS to at most $1.585n + o(n)$ bits. We demonstrate the use of
our data structure by developing another data structure using it that can
represent a sequence of $n$ non-negative integers $x_1, x_2, \ldots x_n$ using
at most $\sum_{i=1}^n x_i + 2n + o(\sum_{i=1}^n x_i+n)$ bits and, in constant
time, determine whether the $i$-th element is $0$ or decrement it otherwise. We
also discuss an algorithm for finding a minimum weight spanning tree of a
weighted undirected graph using at most $n+o(n)$ bits. We also provide an
implementation for DFS that takes $O(m+n)$ time and $O(n \lg(m/n))$ bits. Using
this DFS algorithm and other careful implementations, we can test
biconnectivity, 2-edge connectivity, and determine cut vertices, bridges etc
among others, essentially within the same time and space bounds required for
DFS. These improve the space required for earlier implementations from $\Omega
(n\lg n)$ bits.

  arXiv:1604.00002",,,,"q-bio.NC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  One of the central questions in neuroscience is to understand the way
communication is organized in the brain, trying to comprehend how cognitive
capacities or physiological states of the organism are potentially related to
brain activities involving interactions of several brain areas. One important
characteristic of the functional brain networks is that they are modularly
structured, being this modular architecture regarded to account for a series of
properties and functional dynamics. In the neurobiological context, communities
may indicate brain regions that are involved in one same activity, representing
neural segregated processes. Several studies have demonstrated the modular
character of organization of brain activities. However, empirical evidences
regarding to its dynamics and relation to different levels of consciousness
have not been reported yet. Within this context, this research sought to
characterize the community structure of functional brain networks during an
anesthetic induction process. The experiment was based on intra-cranial
recordings of neural activities of an old world macaque of the species Macaca
fuscata during a Ketamine-Medetomidine anesthetic induction process. Networks
were serially estimated in time intervals of five seconds. Changes were
observed within about one and a half minutes after the administration of the
anesthetics, revealing the occurrence of a transition on the community
structure. The awake state was characterized by the presence of large clusters
involving frontal and parietal regions, while the anesthetized state by the
presence of communities in the primary visual and motor cortices, being the
areas of the secondary associative cortex most affected. The results report the
influence of general anesthesia on the structure of functional clusters,
contributing for understanding some new aspects of neural correlates of
consciousness.

  Placement",,,,,"cs.NI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Traffic engineering has been used in IP and MPLS networks for a number of
years as a tool for making more efficient use of capacity by explicitly routing
traffic demands where there is available network capacity that would otherwise
be unused. Deployment of traffic engineering imposes an additional layer of
complexity to network design and operations, however, which has constrained its
adoption for capacity optimisation. The rise of Software Defined Networks has
renewed interest in the use of traffic engineering approaches leveraging
centralised network controllers for capacity optimisation. We argue that future
networks can realise the network optimisation benefits of traffic engineering
without incurring additional network complexity through closer coupling between
the network and the applications and services using the network. This can be
achieved through leveraging a network- and traffic-aware controller to directly
influence where applications and services site or locate service instances,
i.e. which implicitly impacts the paths that the applications or services
traffic demands take through the network. We call this technique Demand
Engineering. Demand Engineering has the additional benefit of providing an
admission control capability, i.e. which can provide an assurance that network
SLAs can be met. In this paper we describe the concept of Demand Engineering,
give examples of its use and present simulation results indicating its
potential benefits. We also compare demand engineering to traffic engineering.

their system of beliefs and to form polarized groups of like minded people.
Polarization as well as its effects on online social interactions have been
extensively investigated. Still, the relation between group formation and
personality traits remains unclear. A better understanding of the cognitive and
psychological determinants of online social dynamics might help to design more
efficient communication strategies and to challenge the digital misinformation
threat. In this work, we focus on users commenting posts published by US
Facebook pages supporting scientific and conspiracy-like narratives, and we
classify the personality traits of those users according to their online
behavior. We show that different and conflicting communities are populated by
users showing similar psychological profiles, and that the dominant personality
model is the same in both scientific and conspiracy echo chambers. Moreover, we
observe that the permanence within echo chambers slightly shapes users'
psychological profiles. Our results suggest that the presence of specific
personality traits in individuals lead to their considerable involvement in
supporting narratives inside virtual echo chambers.

  Descent-based Analytics",,,,,"cs.LG cs.CR cs.DB stat.ML","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  While significant progress has been made separately on analytics systems for
scalable stochastic gradient descent (SGD) and private SGD, none of the major
scalable analytics frameworks have incorporated differentially private SGD.
There are two inter-related issues for this disconnect between research and
practice: (1) low model accuracy due to added noise to guarantee privacy, and
(2) high development and runtime overhead of the private algorithms. This paper
takes a first step to remedy this disconnect and proposes a private SGD
algorithm to address \emph{both} issues in an integrated manner. In contrast to
the white-box approach adopted by previous work, we revisit and use the
classical technique of {\em output perturbation} to devise a novel ""bolt-on""
approach to private SGD. While our approach trivially addresses (2), it makes
(1) even more challenging. We address this challenge by providing a novel
analysis of the $L_2$-sensitivity of SGD, which allows, under the same privacy
guarantees, better convergence of SGD when only a constant number of passes can
be made over the data. We integrate our algorithm, as well as other
state-of-the-art differentially private SGD, into Bismarck, a popular scalable
SGD-based analytics system on top of an RDBMS. Extensive experiments show that
our algorithm can be easily integrated, incurs virtually no overhead, scales
well, and most importantly, yields substantially better (up to 4X) test
accuracy than the state-of-the-art algorithms on many real datasets.

$98\leq Z \leq 126$, including even - even, odd - even, even - odd and odd -
odd systems. For odd and odd-odd nuclei, adiabatic potential energy surfaces
were calculated by a minimization over configurations with one blocked neutron
or/and proton on a level from the 10-th below to the 10-th above the Fermi
level. The parameters of the model that have been fixed previously by a fit to
masses of even-even heavy nuclei were kept unchanged. A search for saddle
points has been performed by the ""Imaginary Water Flow"" method on a basic
five-dimensional deformation grid, including triaxiality. Two auxiliary grids
were used for checking the effects of the mass asymmetry and hexadecapole
non-axiallity. The ground states were found by energy minimization over
configurations and deformations. We find that the non-axiallity significantly
changes first and second fission barrier in many nuclei. The effect of the mass
- asymmetry, known to lower the second, very deformed barriers in actinides, in
the heaviest nuclei appears at the less deformed saddles in more than 100
nuclei. It happens for those saddles in which the triaxiallity does not play
any role, what suggests a decoupling between effects of the mass-asymmetry and
triaxiality. We studied also the influence of the pairing interaction strength
on the staggering of $B_f$ for odd- and even-particle numbers. Finally, we
provide a comparison of our results with other theoretical fission barrier

dispersive qubit readout, to mediate two-qubit gates, and to shuttle states
between distant quantum systems. A prerequisite for these applications is a
strong qubit-resonator coupling. Strong coupling between an electron-spin qubit
and a microwave resonator can be achieved by correlating spin- and orbital
degrees of freedom. This correlation can be achieved through the Zeeman
coupling of a single electron in a double quantum dot to a spatially
inhomogeneous magnetic field generated by a nearby nanomagnet. In this paper,
we consider such a device and estimate spin-resonator couplings of order ~ 1
MHz with realistic parameters. Further, through realistic simulations, we show
that precise placement of the double dot relative to the nanomagnet allows to
select between a purely longitudinal coupling (commuting with the bare spin
Hamiltonian) and a purely transverse (spin non-conserving) coupling.
Additionally, we suggest methods to mitigate dephasing and relaxation channels
that are introduced in this coupling scheme. This analysis gives a clear route
toward the realization of coherent state transfer between a microwave resonator
and a single electron spin in a GaAs double quantum dot with a fidelity above
90%. Improved dynamical decoupling sequences, low-noise environments, and
longer-lived microwave cavity modes may lead to substantially higher fidelities
in the near future.

consists of solving the inhomogeneous optoacoustic wave equation for an initial

set of observed signals. In this article, we consider the particular case of a
Gaussian transverse irradiation source profile in the paraxial approximation of
the wave equation, for which the direct problem along the beam axis can be cast
into a linear Volterra integral equation of the second kind. This integral
equation can be used in two ways: as a forward solver to predict optoacoustic
signals in terms of the direct problem, and as an inverse solver for which we
here devise highly efficient numerical schemes used for the reconstruction of
initial pressure profiles from observed signals, constituting a methodical
progress of computational aspects of optoacoustics. In this regard, we explore
the validity as well as the limits of the inversion scheme via numerical
experiments, with parameters geared towards actual optoacoustic problem
instances. The considered inversion input consists of synthetic data, obtained
by means of forward solvers based on the Volterra integral, and, more
generally, the optoacoustic Poisson integral. Regarding the latter, we
numerically invert signals that correspond to different detector-to-sample
distances and assess the convergence to the true initial stress profiles upon
approaching the far-field. Finally, we also address the effect of noise on the
quality of the reconstructed pressure profiles.

by the baryons is conserved and always in agreement with Bekenstein's area law
of black holes. Moreover, their (positive) interaction energy reproduces the
expected post-Newtonian correction and becomes of the order of the total ADM
mass of the system when the size of the collapsing object approaches its

gravitational collapse of regular baryonic matter produces a corpuscular black
hole without central singularity, in which both gravitons and baryons are
marginally bound and form a Bose-Einstein condensate at the critical point. The

data in a real-time fashion. It is commonly demanding in computation capacity,
given that the relevant applications involve very large volumes of data. Data
structures act as articulation points and maintain the state of data streaming
operators, potentially supporting high parallelism and balancing the work
between them. Prompted by this fact, in this work we study and analyze
parallelization needs of these articulation points, focusing on the problem of
streaming multiway aggregation, where large data volumes are received from
multiple input streams. The analysis of the parallelization needs, as well as
of the use and limitations of existing aggregate designs and their data
structures, leads us to identify needs for proper shared objects that can
achieve low-latency and high throughput multiway aggregation. We present the
requirements of such objects as abstract data types and we provide efficient
lock-free linearizable algorithmic implementations of them, along with new
multiway aggregate algorithmic designs that leverage them, supporting both
deterministic order-sensitive and order-insensitive aggregate functions.
Furthermore, we point out future directions that open through these

  Perspective","submitted to IEEE Commun. Mag",,,,"cs.IT math.IT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Besides advanced telecommunications techniques, the most prominent evolution
of wireless networks is the densification of network deployment. In particular,
the increasing access points/users density and reduced cell size significantly
enhance spatial reuse, thereby improving network capacity. Nevertheless, does
network ultra-densification and over-deployment always boost the performance of
wireless networks? Since the distance from transmitters to receivers is greatly
reduced in dense networks, signal is more likely to be propagated from long- to
short-range region. Without considering short-range propagation features,
conventional understanding of the impact of network densification becomes
doubtful. With this regard, it is imperative to reconsider the pros and cons
brought by network densification. In this article, we first discuss the
short-range propagation features in densely deployed network and verify through
experimental results the validity of the proposed short-range propagation
model. Considering short-range propagation, we further explore the fundamental
impact of network densification on network capacity, aided by which a concrete
interpretation of ultra-densification is presented from the network capacity
perspective. Meanwhile, as short-range propagation makes interference more
complicated and difficult to handle, we discuss possible approaches to further
enhance network capacity in ultra-dense wireless networks. Moreover, key
challenges are presented to suggest future directions.

sequences in Y starting from information available in X. However, there is no
parallel training data available between X and Y but, training data is
available between X & Z and Z & Y (as is often the case in many real world
applications). Z thus acts as a pivot/bridge. An obvious solution, which is
perhaps less elegant but works very well in practice is to train a two stage
model which first converts from X to Z and then from Z to Y. Instead we explore
an interlingua inspired solution which jointly learns to do the following (i)
encode X and Z to a common representation and (ii) decode Y from this common
representation. We evaluate our model on two tasks: (i) bridge transliteration
and (ii) bridge captioning. We report promising results in both these
applications and believe that this is a right step towards truly interlingua

theorem that even if a Hamiltonian $H(\lambda)$ is an analytic function of a

diagonalization of $H=p^2/2\mu+V_{BB}(x,N)$ in the harmonic oscillator basis.
We show that these real discrete spectra are consistent with the most simple
two-turning point CWKB (C refers to complex turning points) method provided we
choose the maximal turning points (MxTP) [$-a+ib,a+ib, a, b \in {\cal R}$] such

spectrum is null (as $V_{BB}$ becomes a Hermitian flat-top potential barrier).
At $N=6$ and $10$, $V_{BB}(x,N)$ becomes a Hermitian well and we recover its

of the RG flow in the boundary theory. Here, we show that, in single clock
holographic inflation, the time independence of correlators of $\zeta$ follows
from the cut-off independence of correlators of the energy momentum tensor in
the boundary theory, and from the so-called consistency relations for vertex
functions with a soft leg.

conclusion is also obtained under some weaker geometric hypotheses.

response, obtained by accounting for the fluctuations of both the density and

observations of the open cluster NGC 1582 and its surrounding field with
Johnson B, V and R filters by using Nanshan 1m telescope of Xinjiang
Astronomical Observatory. 19 variable stars and 3 variable candidates were
detected in a 45 {\times} 48.75 field around the cluster. 12 of the variable
stars are newly-discovered variable objects. The physical properties,
classifications, and membership of the 22 objects are studied through their
light curves, their positions on the color-magnitude diagram, and with the
archival data from the Naval Observatory Merged Astrometric Dataset. Among
these objects, 5 are eclipsing binary systems, 6 are pulsating variable stars
including one known Delta Scuti star and one newly-discovered RR Lyrae star.
The distance of the RR Lyrae star is estimated to be 7.9 {\pm} 0.3 kpc,
indicates that the star locates far behind the cluster. 4 variable stars are
probable members of the cluster, and 13 of the 22 objects are confirmed to be
field stars.

49.5hr after the time of the GW151226 detection. We typically reached

extragalactic transients (that are not obviously AGN), including a faint
transient in a galaxy at 7Mpc (a luminous blue variable outburst) plus a
rapidly decaying M-dwarf flare. Spectral classification of 20 other transient
events showed them all to be supernovae. We found an unusual transient,
PS15dpn, with an explosion date temporally coincident with GW151226 which
evolved into a type Ibn supernova. The redshift of the transient is secure at
z=0.1747 +/- 0.0001 and we find it unlikely to be linked, since the luminosity
distance has a negligible probability of being consistent with that of
GW151226. In the 290 square degrees surveyed we therefore do not find a likely
counterpart. However we show that our survey strategy would be sensitive to
NS-NS mergers producing kilonovae at D < 100 Mpc which is promising for future
LIGO/Virgo searches.

situations where there is a strong imbalance between the number of foreground

(HSRWL) at 1550nm is proposed and demonstrated by using a pair of upconversion
single-photon detectors and a fiber Fabry-Perot scanning interferometer
(FFP-SI). In order to improve the optical detection efficiency, both the
transmission spectrum and the reflection spectrum of the FFP-SI are used for
spectral analyses of the aerosol backscatter and the reference laser pulse. The
reference signal is tapped from the outgoing laser and served as a zero
velocity indicator. The Doppler shift is retrieved from a frequency response
function Q, which is defined as the ratio of difference of the transmitted
signal and the reflected signal to their sum. Taking advantages of high
signal-to-noise ratio of the detectors and high spectral resolution of the
FFP-SI, the Q spectra of the aerosol backscatter are reconstructed along the
line-of-sight (LOS) of the telescope. By applying a least squares fit procedure
to the measured Q spectra, the center frequencies and the bandwidths are
obtained simultaneously. And then the Doppler shifts are determined relative to
the center frequency of the reference signal. To eliminate the influence of
temperature fluctuations on the FFP-SI, the FFP-SI is cased in a chamber with
temperature stability of 0.001 during the measurement. Continuous LOS wind
observations are carried out on two days at Hefei (31.843 N, 117.265 E), China.
In the meantime, LOS wind measurements from the HSRWL show good agreement with
the results from an ultrasonic wind sensor (Vaisala windcap WMT52). Due to the
computational expensive of the convolution operation of the Q function, an
empirical method is adopted to evaluate the quality of the measurements. The
standard deviation of the wind speed is 0.76 m/s at the 1.8 km. The standard
deviation of the retrieved bandwidth variation is 2.07 MHz at the 1.8 km.

packings which are sheared quasistatically under controlled strain. First, we
show that in the majority of cases, the first contact changes correspond to the
creation or breaking of contacts on a single particle, with contact breaking
overwhelmingly likely for low pressures and/or small systems, and contact
making and breaking equally likely for large pressures and in the thermodynamic
limit. The statistics of the corresponding strains are near-Poissonian. The
mean characteristic strains exhibit scaling with the number of particles N and
pressure P, and reveal the existence of finite size effects akin to those seen
for linear response quantities. Second, we show that linear response accurately
predicts the strains of the first contact changes, which allows us to study the
scaling of the characteristic strains of making and breaking contacts
separately. Both of these show finite size scaling, and we formulate scaling
arguments that are consistent with the observed behavior. Third, we probe the
effect of the first contact change on the shear modulus G, and show in detail
how the variation of G remains smooth and bounded in the large system size
limit: even though contact changes occur then at vanishingly small strains,
their cumulative effect, even at a fixed value of the strain, are limited, so
that effectively, linear response remains well-defined. Fourth, we explore
multiple contact changes under shear, and find strong and surprising
correlations between alternating making and breaking events. Fifth, we show
that by making a link with extremal statistics, our data is consistent with a
very slow crossover to self averaging with system size, so that the
thermodynamic limit is reached much more slowly than expected based on finite
size scaling of elastic quantities or contact breaking strains.

reconstruct images from white noise inputs. The reconstruction quality is
statistically higher than that of the same method applied on well trained

of penalties that are linear in several smoothing parameters, thereby covering
the important cases of tensor product and adaptive smoothers; (ii) we show why
the method's steps increase the restricted marginal likelihood of the model,
that it tends to converge faster than the EM algorithm, or obvious
accelerations of this, and investigate its relation to Newton optimization;
(iii) we generalize the method to any Fisher regular likelihood. The method
represents a considerable simplification over existing methods of estimating
smoothing parameters in the context of regular likelihoods, without sacrificing
generality: for example, it is only necessary to compute with the same first
and second derivatives of the log-likelihood required for coefficient
estimation, and not with the third or fourth order derivatives required by
alternative approaches. Examples are provided which would have been impossible

sufficiently strong to reliably measure its abundance. Fe and Mg exhibit weaker
features that, in most cases, only provide upper limits. We measure [Ca/Fe] and
[Mg/Fe] for EMP stars in the SDSS spectra, and conclude that most of the stars

a number of stars for which only [Fe/H] upper limits could be estimated point

the level of H$\alpha$ emission, but spends most of its time in the B~star
state. EM~Cep has been considered to be an eclipsing, near contact binary of
nearly equal-massed B stars in order to reproduce regular photometric
variations; however, this model is problematic due to the lack of any observed
Doppler shift in the spectrum. Our observations confirm that there are no
apparent Doppler shifts in the wide spectral lines H$\alpha$ and HeI~6678 in
either the B or Be star states.The profiles of HeI~6678 typically exhibited a
filled-in absorption core, but we detected weak emission in this line during
the highest Be state. Given the lack of observed Doppler shifts, we model
EM~Cep as an isolated Be star with a variable circumstellar disk. We can
reproduce the observed H$\alpha$ emission profiles over the eleven year period
reasonably well with disk masses on the order of $3$ to
$10\times\,10^{-11}\;M_*$ in the Be state with the circumstellar disk seen at
an inclination of $78^{\circ}$ to the line of sight. From a disk ejection
episode in 2014, we estimate a mass loss rate of $\approx\,3\times 10^{-9}\;\rm
M_{\odot}\,yr^{-1}$. The derived disk density parameters are typical of those
found for the classical Be stars. We therefore suggest that the EM~Cep is a
classical Be star and that its photometric variations are the result of
$\beta\;$Cep or non-radial pulsations.

by a set of 28 different SFHs based on the Schmidt function, and characterized
by different ratios of the gas infall time scale $\tau_{infall}$ to the star
formation efficiency $\nu$. The treatment of dust extinction and re-emission
has been carried out by means of the radiative transfer calculation. The
spectral energy distribution (SED) fitting technique is performed by using
GOSSIP+, a tool able to combine both photometric and spectroscopic information
to extract the best value of the physical quantities of interest, and to
consider the Intergalactic Medium (IGM) attenuation as a free parameter. We
find that the main contribution to the scatter observed in the $SFR-M_{*}$
plane is the possibility of choosing between different families of SFHs in the
SED fitting procedure, while the redshift range plays a minor role. The
majority of the galaxies, at all cosmic times, are best-fit by models with SFHs
characterized by a high $\tau_{\rm infall}/\nu$ ratio. We discuss the
reliability of the presence of a small percentage of dusty and highly star
forming galaxies, in the light of their detection in the FIR.

to a Poisson process on $T \times [0, \infty)$, where the first co-ordinate
specifies the location of the cut and the second the time at which it occurs.
The genealogy of such a fragmentation is encoded by the so-called cut-tree,
which was introduced by Bertoin and Miermont for a fragmentation of the
Brownian continuum random tree. The cut-tree was generalised by Dieuleveut to a
fragmentation of the $\alpha$-stable trees, $\alpha \in (1, 2)$, and by Broutin
and Wang to the inhomogeneous continuum random trees of Aldous and Pitman.
Remarkably, in all of these cases, the law of the cut-tree is the same as that
of the original R-tree. In this paper, we develop a clean general framework for
the study of cut-trees of R-trees. We then focus particularly on the problem of
reconstruction: how to recover the original R-tree from its cut-tree. This has
been studied in the setting of the Brownian CRT by Broutin and Wang, where they
prove that it is possible to reconstruct the original tree in distribution. We
describe an enrichment of the cut-tree transformation, which endows the cut
tree with information we call a consistent collection of routings. We show this
procedure is well-defined under minimal conditions on the R-trees. We then show
that, for the case of the Brownian CRT and the $\alpha$-stable trees with
$\alpha \in (1, 2)$, the original tree and the Poisson process of cuts thereon
can both be almost surely reconstructed from the enriched cut-trees. For the
latter results, our methods make essential use of the self-similarity and
re-rooting invariance of these trees.

plasmas with ICM-like conditions has yet to be elucidated, however. We use
particle-in-cell simulations and analytic models to explore the dynamics of an
ICM-like plasma (with small gyroradius, large mean-free-path, and strongly
sub-dominant magnetic pressure) driven by the diffusive heat flux associated
with thermal conduction. Lin- ear theory reveals that whistler waves are driven
unstable electron heat flux, even when the heat flux is weak. The resonant
interaction of electrons with these waves then plays a critical role in
scattering electrons and suppressing the heat flux. In a 1D model where only
whistler modes that are parallel to the magnetic field are captured, the only
resonant electrons are moving in the opposite direction to the heat flux and
the electron heat flux suppression is small. In 2D or more, oblique whistler
modes also resonate with electrons moving in the direction of the heat flux.
The overlap of resonances leads to effective symmetrization of the electron
distribution function and a strong suppression of heat flux. The results
suggest that thermal conduction in the ICM might be strongly suppressed,
possibly to negligible levels.

EPM2011) and Planetary and Lunar Ephemeris (INPOP10a). As a result, using the
Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm and calculating the related Chi-squared
statistic, we find that the anomaly is statistical irrelevant in accordance
with INPOP10a observations. As a complement to this work, we also do an
application to the relativistic precession of giant planets using observational

universe~(according to general relativity) containing a generalized holographic
dark energy with a Nojiri - Odintsov cut - off. The second component of the
darkness is assumed to be the pressureless cold dark matter according to
observed symmetries of the large scale universe. Moreover, we assume specific
forms of the interaction between these two components and besides the
cosmographic analysis, we discuss appropriate results from $Om$ and $Om3$
analysis and organize a closer look to the models via the statefinder hierarchy
analysis, too. In this way we study mainly impact of the interaction on the
dynamics of the background of our universe~(within specific forms of
interaction). To complete the cosmographic analysis, the present day values of
the statefinder parameters $(r,s)$ and $(\omega^{\prime}_{de}, \omega_{de})$
has been estimated for all cases and the validity of the generalized second law
of thermodynamics is demonstrated. Our study showed that theoretical results
from considered phenomenological models are consistent with the available
observational data and symmetries.

scattering coefficients. The understanding of the mechanisms involved in the
frequency dependent features of the coefficients has been a challenge task,
owing to the complicated coupling between the waves in open space and the modes
inside the finite scatterer. In this paper, a frequency-dependent modal
description of the scattering coefficient is utilized to study the modal
properties of the scatterer. The important role that eigenmodes play in
defining the features of the scattering coefficients is revealed via an
expansion of the coefficients by the eigenmodes. The results show the local
extrema of the scattering coefficients can be attributed to the
constructive/destructive interference of resonant and non-resonant modes. In
particular, an approximated equation, which is equivalent to the standard Fano
formula, is obtained to describe the sharp anti-symmetric Fano characteristics
of the scattering coefficients. The special cases where scattering is dominated
by a single resonance eigenmode, corresponding to the ""resonance transmission"",
are also illustrated.
