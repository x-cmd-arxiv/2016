are the linear version of the famous geometric rigidity estimate by Friesecke,
James and M\""uller for plates [14] (where they show that the Korn constant in
the nonlinear Korn's first inequality scales like $h^2$), extended to shells
with nonzero curvature. We also recover the uniform Korn-Poincar\'e inequality

atomistic tight-binding model, accounting for variations in strain and built-in

localisation effects in the hole states. These effects are found not only in
the ground states, but also the excited states. We conclude that localisation
effects persist to of order 100~meV into the valence band, for as little as
10\% indium in the quantum well, giving rise to a significant density of
localised states. We find, from an examination of the modulus overlap of the
wave functions, that the hole states can be divided into three regimes of
localisation. Our results also show that localisation effects due to random
alloy fluctuations are far less pronounced for electron states. However, the
combination of electrostatic built-in field, alloy fluctuations and structural
inhomogeneities, such as well-width fluctuations, can nevertheless lead to
significant localisation effects in the electron states, especially at higher

effectively model and predict drug responses. In this study, we propose a novel

exploits the known pathway information in a novel and biologically meaningful
fashion to learn the drug response associations. Our method quantitatively
outperforms the state of the art on predicting drug responses in two publicly

validated our model predictions with lab experiments using an in-house cancer

Small Grains (YVSG), Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons (YPAH) and Big Grains

HII regions classified as filled and mixed than for regions presenting a shell
structure. The enhancement of VSGs within NGC 604 and NGC 595 is correlated to
expansive gas structures with velocities greater than 50 km/s. The gas-to-dust
ratio derived for the HII regions in our sample exhibits two regimes related to
the HI-H2 transition of the ISM. Regions corresponding to the HI diffuse regime
present a gas-to-dust ratio compatible with the expected value if we assume
that the gas-to-dust ratio scales linearly with metallicity, while regions
corresponding to a H2 molecular phase present a flatter dust-gas surface
density distribution. The fraction of VSGs can be affected by the conditions of
the interstellar environment: strong shocks of 50-90 km/s existing in the
interior of the most luminous HII regions can lead to fragmentation of BGs into
smaller ones, while the more evolved shell and clear shell objects provide a
more quiescent environment where reformation of dust BG grains might occur. The
gas-to-dust variations found in this analysis might imply that grain
coagulation and/or gas-phase metals incorporation to the dust mass is occurring
in the interior of the HII regions in M33.

While all
agents are potentially compatible with each other, some are hard-to-match and
others are easy-to-match. Agents prefer to be matched as soon as possible and
matches are formed either bilaterally or indirectly through chains. We adopt an
asymptotic approach and compute tight bounds on the limit of waiting time of
agents under myopic policies that differ in matching technology and
prioritization.
  We find that the market composition is a key factor in the desired matching
technology and prioritization level. When hard-to-match agents arrive less
frequently than easy-to-match ones (i) bilateral matching is almost as
efficient as chains (waiting times scale similarly under both, though chains
always outperform bilateral matching by a constant factor), and (ii) assigning
priorities to hard-to-match agents improves their waiting times. When
hard-to-match agents arrive more frequently, chains are much more efficient
than bilateral matching and prioritization has no impact.
  We further conduct comparative statics on arrival rates. Somewhat
surprisingly, we find that in a heterogeneous market and under bilateral
matching, increasing arrival rate has a non-monotone effect on waiting times,
due to the fact that, under some market compositions, there is an adverse
effect of competition. Our comparative statics shed light on the impact of
merging markets and attracting altruistic agents (that initiate chains) or
easy-to-match agents.

processing, e.g., spliceosomal removal of introns from pre-mRNAs. Spliceosomes
are large macromolecular machines that are comparable to ribosomes in size and
complexity, and are composed of uridine-rich small nuclear RNPs (U snRNPs).
Various sets of seven different Sm proteins form the cores of most snRNPs.
Despite their importance, very little is known about the atomic-resolution

show that coupling between electron orbital angular momentum and a spatially
varying magnetic field produces an angular momentum-dependent focusing effect.
We propose a design for an orbital angular momentum measurement device built on
this principle. As the method of measurement is non-interferometric, the device
works equally well for mixed, superposed and pure final orbital angular
momentum states. The energy and orbital angular momentum distributions of
inelastically scattered electrons may be simultaneously measurable with this

computations of LSS observables with the required precision in the mildly
nonlinear regime. In this paper, we develop efficient implementations of these
computations that allow for an exploration of their dependence on cosmological
parameters. They are based on two ideas. First, once an observable has been
computed with high precision for a reference cosmology, for a new cosmology the
same can be easily obtained with comparable precision just by adding the
difference in that observable, evaluated with much less precision. Second, most
cosmologies of interest are sufficiently close to the Planck best-fit cosmology
that observables can be obtained from a Taylor expansion around the reference
cosmology. These ideas are implemented for the matter power spectrum at two
loops and are released as public codes. When applied to cosmologies that are
within 3$\sigma$ of the Planck best-fit model, the first method evaluates the
power spectrum in a few minutes on a laptop, with results that have 1\% or
better precision, while with the Taylor expansion the same quantity is
instantly generated with similar precision. The ideas and codes we present may
easily be extended for other applications or higher-precision results.

a collection $S$ of its variables for which there is a unique partial

that, under the widely believed assumption that integer factoring is hard,
there exist sets of boolean formulas that have obvious, nontrivial backbones

that, under the same assumption, there exist sets of boolean formulas that
obviously have large backbones yet producing such a backbone $S$ is
intractable. Furthermore, we show that if integer factoring is not merely
worst-case hard but is frequently hard, as is widely believed, then the
frequency of hardness in our two results is not too much less than that

an overview of the structure of cosmological uplifts of holographic duality. A
full treatment of the problem requires `ultraviolet completion' because of the
sensitivity of inflation to quantum gravity effects, including back reaction
and non-adiabatic production of heavy degrees of freedom. Cosmological
observations imply accelerated expansion of the late universe, and provide
increasingly precise constraints and discovery potential on the amplitude and
shape of primordial tensor and scalar perturbations, and some of their
correlation functions. Most backgrounds of string theory have positive
potential energy, with a rich but still highly constrained landscape of
solutions. The theory contains novel mechanisms for inflation, some subject to
significant observational tests. Although the detailed ultraviolet completion
is not accessible experimentally, some of these mechanisms directly stimulate a
more systematic analysis of the space of low energy theories and signatures
relevant for analysis of data, which is sensitive to physics orders of
magnitude above the energy scale of inflation as a result of long time

among agents in a multi-agent network can be quantified by a connectivity
measure, called as the Algebraic Connectivity of the associated graph

them as edges. Distinct topologies with the same connectivity play profound
role in multi-agent dynamics as they offer various ways to reorganize agents
locations according to the requirement during a cooperative mission, without
sacrificing the information exchange capability of the entire network.
Determination of the distinct multi-agent graphs with identical connectivity is
a multimodal problem, in other words, there exist multiple graphs that share
the same connectivity. We present analytical solutions of determining distinct
graphs with identical connectivity. A family of isospectral graphs are found
out by utilizing an appropriate similarity transformation. Moreover, a zone of
no connectivity change in a dense graph is unraveled where an agent can move
freely without causing any change in the global connectivity. The proposed
solutions are validated with the help of sufficient examples.

Canards in slow-fast systems with (at least) two slow variables, especially
near folded-node singularities, give an essential generating mechanism for
Mixed-Mode oscillations (MMOs) in the framework of smooth multiple timescale
systems. There is a wealth of literature on such slow-fast dynamical systems
and many models displaying canard-induced MMOs, in particular in neuroscience.
In parallel, since the late 1990s several papers have shown that the canard
phenomenon can be faithfully reproduced with piecewise-linear (PWL) systems in
two dimensions although very few results are available in the three-dimensional
case. The present paper aims to bridge this gap by analysing canonical PWL
systems that display folded singularities, primary and secondary canards, with
a similar control of the maximal winding number as in the smooth case. We also
show that the singular phase portraits are compatible in both frameworks.
Finally, we show on an example how to construct a (linear) global return and

recurrent deep neural network, where every module in the network corresponds to
a complete answering unit with attention mechanism by itself. The network is
optimized by minimizing loss aggregated from all the units, which share model
parameters while receiving different information to compute attention
probability. For training, our model attends to a region within image feature
map, updates its memory based on the question and attended image feature, and
answers the question based on its memory state. This procedure is performed to
compute loss in each step. The motivation of this approach is our observation
that multi-step inferences are often required to answer questions while each
problem may have a unique desirable number of steps, which is difficult to
identify in practice. Hence, we always make the first unit in the network solve
problems, but allow it to learn the knowledge from the rest of units by
backpropagation unless it degrades the model. To implement this idea, we
early-stop training each unit as soon as it starts to overfit. Note that, since
more complex models tend to overfit on easier questions quickly, the last
answering unit in the unfolded recurrent neural network is typically killed
first while the first one remains last. We make a single-step prediction for a
new question using the shared model. This strategy works better than the other
options within our framework since the selected model is trained effectively
from all units without overfitting. The proposed algorithm outperforms other
multi-step attention based approaches using a single step prediction in VQA

We show that the bulk of the variability is repeatable across the last five

super-imposed on the P Cygni absorption troughs that has been previously
un-observed in these lines, but which bears resemblance to the observations of
the He~I $\lambda$10830 \AA\ feature across previous cycles. Through a

1986, a universal phase diagram has been constructed experimentally and
numerous theoretical models have been proposed. However, there remains no
consensus on the underlying physics thus far. Here, we theoretically
investigate the phase diagram of hole-doped cuprates based on an
itinerant-localized dual fermion model, with the charge carriers doped on the
oxygen sites and localized holes on the copper $d_{x^{2}-y^{2}}$ orbitals. We
analytically demonstrate that the puzzling anomalous normal state or the
strange metal could simply stem from a free Fermi gas of carriers bathing in
copper antiferromagnetic spin fluctuations. The short-range high-energy spin
excitations also act as the `magnetic glue' of carrier Cooper pairs and induce
$d$-wave superconductivity from the underdoped to overdoped regime, distinctly
diffrent from the conventional low-frequency magnetic fluctuation mechanism. We
further sketch out the characteristic dome-shaped critical temperature $T_c$
versus doping level. The emergence of the pseudogap is ascribed to the
localization of partial carriers coupled to the local copper moments or a
crossover from the strange metal to a nodal Kondo-like insulator. Our work
provides a consistent theoretical framework to understand the typical phase
diagram of hole-doped cuprates and paves a distinct way to the studies of both
non-Fermi liquid and unconventional superconductivity in strongly correlated

of theoretical findings is that Moran's index is a characteristic parameter of

object Mrk421 during the historical low-flux state of the source in January
2013. NuSTAR observations were conducted four times between MJD56294 and
MJD56312 with a total exposure of 80.9 ksec. The source flux in the 3-40 keV
range was nearly constant except for MJD56307, when the average flux level
increased by a factor of three. Throughout the exposure, the X-ray spectra of
Mrk421 were well represented by a steep power-law model with a photon index of
3.1, although a significant excess was noted above 20 keV in the MJD56302 data
when the source was in its faintest state. Moreover, Mrk421 was detected at
more than the 4-sigma level in the 40-79 keV count maps for both MJD56307 and
MJD56302 but not during the remaining two observations. The detected excess
hard X-ray emissions connect smoothly with the extrapolation of the high-energy
gamma-ray continuum of the blazar constrained by Fermi-LAT during the source
quiescence. These findings indicate that, while the overall X-ray spectrum of
Mrk421 is dominated by the highest-energy tail of the synchrotron continuum,
the variable excess hard X-ray emission above 20 keV (on the timescale of a
week) is related to the inverse Compton emission component. We discuss the
resulting constraints on the variability and spectral properties of the
low-energy segment of the electron energy distribution in the source.

this paper, we propose a Demand Distribution Driven Store Placement (D3SP)
framework for business store placement by mining search query data from Baidu
Maps. D3SP first detects the spatial-temporal distributions of customer demands
on different business services via query data from Baidu Maps, the largest
online map search engine in China, and detects the gaps between demand and sup-
ply. Then we determine candidate locations via clustering such gaps. In the
final stage, we solve the location optimization problem by predicting and
ranking the number of customers. We not only deploy supervised regression
models to predict the number of customers, but also learn to rank models to
directly rank the locations. We evaluate our framework on various types of
businesses in real-world cases, and the experiments results demonstrate the
effectiveness of our methods. D3SP as the core function for store placement has
already been implemented as a core component of our business analytics platform
and could be potentially used by chain store merchants on Baidu Nuomi.

As a reward for the cooperation, the secondary network gains the spectrum
access where SUs transmit to HAP using time division multiple access. To
maximize the sum-throughput of SUs, we present a secondary sum-throughput
optimal resource allocation (STORA) scheme. Under the constraint of meeting
target primary rate, the STORA scheme chooses the optimal set of relaying SUs

exploiting the structure of the optimal solution, we find the order in which
SUs are prioritized to relay primary data. Since the STORA scheme focuses on
the sum-throughput, it becomes inconsiderate towards individual SU throughput,
resulting in low fairness. To enhance fairness, we investigate three resource
allocation schemes, which are (i) equal time allocation, (ii) minimum

results reveal the trade-off between sum-throughput and fairness. The minimum
throughput maximization scheme is the fairest one as each SU gets the same

fields, including climate modeling, weather prediction, renewable energy
generation, and satellite communications. Due to the wide variety of cloud
types and lighting conditions in such images, accurate and robust segmentation
of clouds is challenging. In this paper, we present a supervised segmentation
framework for ground-based sky/cloud images based on a systematic analysis of
different color spaces and components, using partial least squares (PLS)
regression. Unlike other state-of-the-art methods, our proposed approach is
entirely learning-based and does not require any manually-defined parameters.
In addition, we release the Singapore Whole Sky IMaging SEGmentation Database
(SWIMSEG), a large database of annotated sky/cloud images, to the research
community.

provided important new observational constraints on the nature of its 1840's
era giant eruption. Spectra of the echoes suggest a relatively cool spectral
temperature of about 5500K, lower than the lower limit of about 7000K suggested
in the optically thick wind outflow analysis of Davidson (1987). This has lead
to a debate about the viability of this steady wind model relative to
alternative, explosive scenarios. Here we present an updated analysis of the
wind outflow model using newer low-temperature opacity tabulations and
accounting for the stronger mass loss implied by the $>$10 Msun mass now
inferred for the Homunculus. A major conclusion is that, because of the sharp
drop in opacity due to free electron recombination for $T<$6500K, a low
temperature of about 5000K is compatible with, and indeed expected from, a wind
with the extreme mass loss inferred for the eruption. Within a spherical gray
model in radiative equilibrium, we derive spectral energy distributions for
various assumptions for the opacity variation of the wind, providing a basis
for comparisons with observed light echo spectra. The scaling results here are
also potentially relevant for other highly optically thick outflows, including
those from classical novae, giant eruptions of LBVs and SN Type IIn precursors.
A broader issue therefore remains whether the complex, variable features
observed from such eruptions are better understood in terms of a steady or
explosive paradigm, or perhaps a balance of these idealizations.

interlayer resistance monotonically increases with the supercell lattice

weakly depends on the misorientation angle. Interlayer rotation between an

little effect on the hole current. We estimate numerical bounds and explain the

dominated era until it reaches a minimal radius. After that it expands in a
decelerating way, until at late times, where it expands in an accelerating way,
thus the model is described by a dark energy era that follows the matter
dominated era. Depending on the choice of the free parameters of the model, the
dark energy era is quintessential like which follows the matter domination era,
and eventually it crosses the phantom divide line and becomes phantom. At the
end of the dark energy era, a Rip singularity exists, where the scale factor
and Hubble rate diverge, however the physical system cannot reach the
singularity, since the effective energy density and pressure become complex.
This indicates two things, firstly that the ordinary Loop Quantum Cosmology
matter bounce evolution stops, thus ending the infinite repetition of the
ordinary matter bounce scenario. Secondly, the fact that both the pressure and
the density become complex indicates probably that the description of the
cosmic evolution within the theoretical context of Loop Quantum Cosmology,
ceases to describe the physics of the system and possibly a more fundamental
theory of quantum gravity is needed near the would be Rip singularity. We

the momentum dependence of the nonsymmorphic symmetry, which puts strong
restrictions on the global structure of the band configurations. Three
different types of nonsymmorphic symmetries are considered: (i) a unitary
nonsymmorphic symmetry, (ii) a nonsymmorphic magnetic symmetry, and (iii) a
nonsymmorphic symmetry combined with inversion. For nonsymmorphic symmetries of
the latter two types, the band crossings are located at high-symmetry points of
the Brillouin zone, with their exact positions being determined by the algebra

atoms in D spatial dimensions. For bosonic atoms we explicitly show how to
regularize this divergent contribution, which appears in the Gaussian
fluctuations of the functional integration, by using three different
regularization approaches: dimensional regularization, momentum-cutoff
regularization and convergence-factor regularization. In the case of the ideal
Bose gas the divergent zero-point fluctuations are completely removed, while in
the case of the interacting Bose gas these zero-point fluctuations give rise to
a finite correction to the equation of state. The final convergent equation of
state is independent of the regularization procedure but depends on the
dimensionality of the system and the two-dimensional case is highly nontrivial.
We also discuss very recent theoretical results on the divergent zero-point
energy of the D-dimensional superfluid Fermi gas in the BCS-BEC crossover. In
this case the zero-point energy is due to both fermionic single-particle
excitations and bosonic collective excitations, and its regularization gives
remarkable analytical results in the BEC regime of composite bosons. We compare
the beyond-mean-field equations of state of both bosons and fermions with
relevant experimental data on dilute and ultracold atoms quantitatively
confirming the contribution of zero-point-energy quantum fluctuations to the

mechanical properties of zirconium (Zr) or its alloys in nuclear reactors.
However, how the point defect changes the mechanical properties has been rarely
studied. Here, we systematically investigated the effect of vacancies on the
mechanical properties of alpha-Zr based on density functional theory (DFT).
Both uniformly distributed vacancies and vacancy clusters were considered. Our
results reveal that the existence of vacancy will reduce the bulk modulus,
while enhance the shear and Young's moduli. Based on these moduli, the
ductility and hardness were further calculated. With the introduction of
vacancy, the ductility decreases, but the hardness increases. However, when the
vacancy concentration is larger than a critical value, a rise in the ductility
and a reduction in the hardness occur, which indicates the degeneration of the
material. Moreover, it was found that the vacancies lead to a more isotropic
distribution of Young's modulus in 3D space. To further investigate how the
clustering of vacancies influences the mechanical properties, the most stable
configurations of di- and trivacancy clusters have been predicted, which
correspond to the most compact distribution of vacancies. Compared with the
uniform distribution of vacancies, clustering of vacancies will strengthen the
above changes of elastic moduli, ductility and hardness. Our results indicate
that the increase of the vacancy concentration may be the basic cause for the
changes of the mechanical properties under irradiation, while the formation of
vacancy clusters intensifies these changes.

when dealing with highly elliptical orbits. On the one hand, analytical
solutions are quite generally expanded into power series of the eccentricity
and so limited to quasi-circular orbits. On the other hand, the time-dependency
due to the motion of the third body (e.g. Moon and Sun) is almost always
neglected. We propose several tools to overcome these limitations. Firstly, we
have expanded the third-body disturbing function into a finite polynomial using
Fourier series in multiple of the satellite's eccentric anomaly (instead of the
mean anomaly) and involving Hansen-like coefficients. Next, by combining the
classical Brouwer-von Zeipel procedure and the time-dependent Lie-Deprit
transforms, we have performed a normalization of the expanded Hamiltonian in
order to eliminate all the periodic terms. One of the benefits is that the
original Brouwer solution for J2 is not modified. The main difficulty lies in
the fact that the generating functions of the transformation must be computed
by solving a partial differential equation, involving derivatives with respect
to the mean anomaly, which appears implicitly in the perturbation. We present a
method to solve this equation by means of an iterative process. Finally we have
obtained an analytical tool useful for the mission analysis, allowing to
propagate the osculating motion of objects on highly elliptical orbits (e>0.6)
over long periods efficiently with very high accuracy, or to determine initial
elements or mean elements. Comparisons between the complete solution and the
numerical simulations will be presented.

STG as input written in a subset of Java and a structural language in the style
of a Kahn Processing Network (KPN). Unlike the Ambric tools, our HLS tool
analyzes the parallelism internal to each Java ""node"" and evaluates the
throughput and area of several possible implementations. It then analyzes the
full graph for bottlenecks or excess compute capacity, selects an
implementation for each node, and even considers replicating or splitting nodes
while either minimizing area (for a fixed throughput target), or maximizing
throughput (for a fixed area target). In addition to traditional node selection
and replication methods used in prior work, we have uniquely implemented node
combining and splitting to find a better area/throughput trade-off. We present
two optimization approaches, a formal ILP formulation and a heuristic solution.
Results show that the heuristic is more flexible and can find design points not
available to the ILP, thereby achieving superior results.

The material with tensor $\BC_2$ corresponds to a material which (for technical
reasons) is almost rigid in the limit $\Gd\to \infty$. The paper, and the
underlying microgeometries, have many aspects in common with the companion
paper ""On the possible effective elasticity tensors of 2-dimensional printed

to solve: determining the subspaces of stress fields for which the thin walled
structures can be rigid, rather than determining, as in the companion paper,
the subspaces of strain fields for which the thin walled structure is
compliant. Recalling that $GU_f$ is completely characterized through minimums
of sums of energies, involving a set of applied strains, and complementary
energies, involving a set of applied stresses, we provide descriptions of
microgeometries that in appropriate limits achieve the minimums in many cases.
In these cases the calculation of the minimum is reduced to a finite
dimensional minimization problem that can be done numerically. Each
microgeometry consists of a union of walls in appropriate directions, where the
material in the wall is an appropriate $p$-mode material, that is almost rigid
to $6-p\leq 5$ independent applied stresses, yet is compliant to any strain in
the orthogonal space. Thus the walls, by themselves, can support stress with
almost no deformation. The region outside the walls contains ""Avellaneda

However, it was reported recently that LaSb and LaBi also exhibit XMR, even
though the rock-salt structure of these materials has inversion symmetry, and
the band-structure calculations do not show a Dirac dispersion in the bulk.
Here, we present magnetoresistance and specific heat measurements on NdSb,
which is isostructural with LaSb. NdSb has an antiferromagnetic groundstate,
and in analogy with the lanthanum monopnictides, is expected to be a
topologically non-trivial semi-metal. We show that NdSb has an XMR of 10^4 %,
even within the AFM state, illustrating that XMR can occur independently of the
absence of time reversal symmetry breaking in zero magnetic field. The
persistence of XMR in a magnetic system offers promise of new functionality
when combining topological matter with electronic correlations. We also find
that in an applied magnetic field below the Neel temperature there is a first
order transition, consistent with evidence from previous neutron scattering
work.

similar to the behavior of a zener diode. The measured temperature coefficient
of the breakdown voltage is $(59.4 \pm 0.4$ mV)$/^{\circ} \mathrm C$. According
to this fact, an analog power supply based on two zener diodes and an
operational amplifier was designed with a positive temperature coefficient. The
measured temperature dependence for the designed power supply is between 63.65

power supply can bias the MPPC at an over-voltage with a temperature variation

inferences from observational data. The field is currently undergoing a
revolution fuelled by increasing numbers of genetic variants demonstrated to be
associated with exposures in genome-wide association studies, and the public
availability of summarized data on genetic associations with exposures and
outcomes from large consortia. A Mendelian randomization analysis with many
genetic variants can be performed relatively simply using summarized data.
However, a causal interpretation is only assured if each genetic variant
satisfies the assumptions of an instrumental variable. To provide some
protection against failure of these assumptions, robust methods for
instrumental variable analysis have been proposed. Here, we develop three
extensions to instrumental variable methods using: i) robust regression, ii)
the penalization of weights from candidate instruments with heterogeneous
causal estimates, and iii) L1 penalization. Results from a wide variety of
robust methods, including the recently-proposed MR-Egger and median-based
methods, are compared in an extensive simulation study. We demonstrate that two
methods, robust regression in an inverse-variance weighted method and a simple
median of the causal estimates from the individual variants, have considerably
improved Type 1 error rates compared with conventional methods in a wide
variety of scenarios when up to 30% of the genetic variants are invalid
instruments. While the MR-Egger method gives unbiased estimates when its
assumptions are satisfied, these estimates are less efficient than those from
other methods and are highly sensitive to violations of the assumptions.
Methods that make different assumptions should be used routinely to assess the
robustness of findings from applied Mendelian randomization investigations with

  convergence of families obtained by biasing or by the stationary excess

random variables, such that monotonicity, injectivity and effect of size
biasing. Convergence of Mellin transforms is also entirely formalized through
convergence in distribution and uniform integrability. As an application, we
study a problem raised by Harkness and Shantaram (1969) who obtained, under
sufficient conditions, a limit theorem for sequences of nonnegative random
variables build with the iterated stationary excess operator. We reformulate
this problem through the concept of multiply monotone functions and through the
convergence of families build by the continuous time version of the iterated
stationary excess operator and also by size biasing. The latter allows us to
show that in our context, continuous time convergence is equivalent to discrete
time convergence, that the conditions of Harkness and Shantaram are actually
necessary and that the only possible limits in distribution are mixture of
exponential with lognormal distributions.

  feature sets","submission to ICPR 2016",,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In this paper, we consider the problem of finding the feature correspondences
among a collection of feature sets, by using their point-wise unary features.
This is a fundamental problem in computer vision and pattern recognition, which
also closely relates to other areas such as operational research. Different
from two-set matching which can be transformed to a quadratic assignment
programming task that is known NP-hard, inclusion of merely unary attributes
leads to a linear assignment problem for matching two feature sets. This
problem has been well studied and there are effective polynomial global optimum
solvers such as the Hungarian method. However, it becomes ill-posed when the
unary attributes are (heavily) corrupted. The global optimal correspondence
concerning the best score defined by the attribute affinity/cost between the
two sets can be distinct to the ground truth correspondence since the score
function is biased by noises. To combat this issue, we devise a method for
matching a collection of feature sets by synergetically exploring the
information across the sets. In general, our method can be perceived from a
(constrained) clustering perspective: in each iteration, it assigns the
features of one set to the clusters formed by the rest of feature sets, and
updates the cluster centers in turn. Results on both synthetic data and real
images suggest the efficacy of our method against state-of-the-arts.

  data, version corresponding to the one published in \emph{Symmetry}",,,,"hep-ph hep-ex","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The 125 GeV boson is quite consistent with the Higgs boson of the Standard
Model (SM), but there is a challenge from Anderson whether this particle is in
the Lagrangian. As LHC Run 2 takes its final year of running, we ought to
reflect and make sure we have gotten everything right. The ATLAS and CMS
combined Run 1 analysis claims 5.4$\sigma$ measurement of vector boson fusion
(VBF) production that is consistent with SM, which seemingly refutes Anderson.
However, to verify the source of electroweak symmetry breaking (EWSB), we
caution that VBF measurement is too important for us to be imprudent in any
way, and gluon-gluon fusion (ggF) with similar tag jets must be simultaneously
\emph{measured}, which should be achievable at LHC Run 2. The point is to truly
test the dilaton possibility, the pseudo-Goldstone boson of scale invariance
violation. We illustrate EWSB by dynamical mass generation of a sequential
quark doublet $Q$ via its ultrastrong Yukawa coupling, and argue how this might
be consistent with a 125 GeV dilaton, ${\cal D}$. The ultraheavy $2m_Q \gtrsim
4$--5 TeV scale explains the absence of New Physics so far, while the mass
generation mechanism shields us from the UV theory for the strong Yukawa
coupling. Collider and flavor physics implications are briefly touched upon.
Current Run 2 analyses show correlations between the ggF and VBF measurements,
but the newly observed $t\bar tH$ production at LHC poses a challenge.

photometry and high dispersion spectroscopic observations, during four
consecutive nights. The strong photometric modulation related to with the
67-min spin period of the primary star is clearly present, as well as the
narrow eclipses associated to the orbital modulation. Since our eclipse timings
have been obtained almost 91,000 cycles since the last reported observations,
we present new linear ephemeris, although we cannot rule out a sinusoidal
variation suggested by previous authors. The system mainly shows double-peaked
H$\alpha$, H$\beta$ and HeI $\lambda$5876 \AA emission lines. From the profile
of the H$\alpha$ line, we find two components; one with a steep rise and
velocities not larger than $\sim$1000 km s$^{-1}$ and another broader component
extending up to $\sim$2000 km s$^{-1}$, which we interpret as coming mainly
from the inner disc. A strong and variable hotspot is found and a stream-like
structure is seen at times. We show that the best solution correspond to $K_1 =
58 \pm 5$ km s$^{-1}$ from H$\alpha$, from the two emission components, which
are both in phase with the orbital modulation. We remark on a peculiar effect
in the radial velocity curve around phase zero, which could be interpreted as a
Rositter-MacLaughlin-like effect, which has been taken into account before
deriving $K_1$. This value is compatible with the values found in
high-resolution both in the ultraviolet and X-ray. We find: $M_{1} = 0.78 \pm
0.03$ M$_{\odot}$, $ M_{2} = 0.10 \pm 0.02$ M$_{\odot}$ and $a = 0.67 \pm 0.01$
R$_{\odot}$. Doppler Tomography has been applied, to construct six Doppler
tomograms for single orbital cycles spanning the four days of observations to
support our conclusions. Our results indicate that EX Hya has a well formed
disc and that the magnetosphere should extend only to about
$3.75\,R_{\rm{WD}}$.

underlying software packages built for rapid, fully automated reporting and
response to astronomical transient alerts. These packages build on the mature
'VOEvent' standardized message-format, and aim to provide a decentralized and
open infrastructure for handling transient alerts. In particular we draw
attention to the initial release of voeventdb, an archive and remote-query
service that allows astronomers to make historical queries about transient
alerts. By employing spatial filters and web-of-citation lookups, voeventdb
enables cross-matching of transient alerts to bring together data from multiple
sources, as well as providing a point of reference when planning new follow-up
campaigns. We also highlight the recent addition of optical-transient feeds
from the ASASSN and GAIA projects to our VOEvent distribution stream. Both the
source-code and deployment-scripts which implement these services are freely
available and permissively licensed, with the intention that other teams may
use them to implement local or project-specific VOEvent archives. In the course
of describing these packages we provide a basic primer for getting started with
automated transient astronomy, including a condensed introduction to the
VOEvent standard.
