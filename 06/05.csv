construct a broadband emission model of magnetar wind nebulae (MWNe). The model
is similar to past studies of young pulsar wind nebulae (PWNe) around RPPs, but
is modified for the application to MWNe that have far less observational

youngest ($\sim$ 1kyr) magnetar 1E 1547.0-5408 that has the largest spin-down
power $L_{\rm spin}$ among all the magnetars. However, the MWN is faint because
of low $L_{\rm spin}$ of 1E 1547.0-5408 compared with the young RPPs. Since
most of parameters are not well constrained only by an X-ray flux upper limit
of the MWN, we adopt the model parameters from young PWN Kes 75 around PSR
J1846-0258 that is a peculiar RPP showing magnetar-like behaviors. The model
predicts $\gamma$-ray flux that will be detected in a future TeV $\gamma$-ray

that 1E 1547.0-5408 had milliseconds period at its birth because the particles
injected early phase of evolution are suffered from severe adiabatic and
synchrotron losses. Further both observational and theoretical studies of the

development is complex, and constantly adapting to environmental stimuli. Here,
we review the fundamental physical processes the govern the inception, growth

valuable insight in that the detection of a few significant (top) objects in an

critical resource constraint in many real-world scenarios. Additionally, we
address the issue of how word embeddings could be used to infer the verb

geometric effect known as current crowding to sense the flow of current and
actuate a readout signal. The device consists of a ""Y""-shaped current combiner,
with two currents (sense and bias) entering through the top arms of the ""Y"",
intersecting, and then exiting through the bottom leg of the ""Y""'. This
geometry--mixing two inputs at a sharp intersection point--takes its
inspiration from Y-shaped combiners in fluid flow systems, where variations in
the input pressures can produce at turbulence and mixing at the intersection.
When current is added to or removed from one of the arms (the sense arm), the
superconducting critical current in the other arm (the bias arm) is modulated.
The current in the sense arm can thus be determined by measuring the critical
current of the bias arm. The dependence of the bias critical current on the
sense current is possible because current crowding causes the sense current to
interact locally with the bias arm. Measurement of the critical current in the
bias arm does not break the superconducting state of the sense arm or of the
bottom leg, and thus the signal to be sensed is fully restored after the
measurement process. This device thus has potential for broad applicability
across superconducting technologies and materials.

When these systems produce compact radio emission and X-ray emission, they can
be placed on the fundamental plane (FP), an empirical relationship between
compact radio luminosity, X-ray luminosity, and black hole mass. We consider a
fundamental line (FL) of black hole activity written in terms of dimensionless
intrinsic physical quantities: $\rm{log} (L_j/L_{Edd}) = A
~\rm{log}(L_{bol}/L_{Edd}) +B$ or equivalently $\rm{log} (L_j/L_{bol}) = (A-1)
~\rm{log}(L_{bol}/L_{Edd}) +B$, and show that the FP may be written in the form
of the FL. The FL has a smaller dispersion than the FP suggesting the FP
derives from the FL. Disk-dominated and jet-dominated systems have consistent
best fit FL parameters suggesting they are governed by the same physics. There
are sharp cutoffs at $L_{bol}/L_{Edd} \simeq 1$ and $L_j/L_{Edd} \simeq 0.2$,
and no indication of a strong break as $L_{bol}/L_{Edd} \rightarrow 1$.
Consistent values of $A$ are obtained for numerous samples including FRII
sources, LINERS, AGNs with compact radio emission, and Galactic black holes,
which indicate a weighted mean value of $A \simeq 0.45 \pm 0.01$. The results
suggest that a common physical mechanism related to the dimensionless
bolometric luminosity of the disk controls the jet power relative to the disk
power. The beam power $L_j$ can be obtained by combining FP best-fit parameters
and compact radio luminosity for sources that fall on the FP.

face a simple binary choice, to ""cooperate"" or ""defect"". Real individuals,
however, often exhibit behavioral diversity, varying their input to a social
interaction both qualitatively and quantitatively. Here we explore how access
to a greater diversity of behavioral choices impacts the evolution of social
dynamics in finite populations. We show that, in public goods games, some
two-choice strategies can nonetheless resist invasion by all possible
multi-choice invaders, even while engaging in relatively little punishment. We
also show that access to greater behavioral choice results in more ""rugged ""
fitness landscapes, with populations able to stabilize cooperation at multiple
levels of investment, such that choice facilitates cooperation when returns on
investments are low, but hinders cooperation when returns on investments are
high. Finally, we analyze iterated rock-paper-scissors games, whose
non-transitive payoff structure means unilateral control is difficult and
zero-determinant strategies do not exist in general. Despite this, we find that
a large portion of multi-choice strategies can invade and resist invasion by
strategies that lack behavioral diversity -- so that even well-mixed

passivation provides a means to remove the native oxide and prevent its

dielectric deposition by measuring electrical conductance through nanowire
field effect transistors treated with a variety of surface preparations. By
extracting field effect mobility, subthreshold swing, threshold shift with

found that a combination of chemical passivation followed by deposition of an

is linearly related to its velocity and the viscosity of the medium. This
linear dependence on viscosity forms the basis for many characterization
techniques for liquids. Unlike viscosities of different liquids, viscosities of
gases vary only in a narrow range which limits their use as an effective
characterization parameter using moving structures. Here we report experimental
results of dissipation showing exponential dependence on viscosity for
oscillating surfaces modified with nanostructures. The surface nanostructures
alter solid-gas interplay greatly, amplifying the dissipation response
exponentially for even minute variations in viscosity. Nanostructured resonator
thus allows discrimination of otherwise narrow range of gaseous viscosity
making it an ideal detection parameter for analysis. We attribute the observed
exponential enhancement to the stochastic nature of interactions of many
coupled nanostructures with the gas media.

analyze the correlation between values for a_surf and the characteristic
energies of the fission barrier of Pu240; and third, to lay out a procedure how
the deformation properties of the Skyrme energy density functional (EDF) can be
constrained during the parameter fit.
  There are several frequently used possibilities to define and calculate the
surface energy coefficient a_surf of effective interactions. The most direct
access is provided by the model system of semi-infinite nuclear matter, but
a_surf can also be extracted from the systematics of binding energies of finite
nuclei. Calculations can be carried out either self-consistently (HF), which
incorporates quantal shell effects, or in one of the semi-classical Extended
Thomas-Fermi (ETF) or Modified Thomas-Fermi (MTF) approximations.
  The surface energy coefficient of 76 parameterizations of the Skyrme EDF have
been calculated. Values obtained with the HF, ETF and MTF methods are not
identical, but differ by fairly constant systematic offsets.
  Despite having some drawbacks compared to the other methods studied here, the
MTF approach provides sufficiently precise values for a_surf such that it can
be used as a very robust constraint on surface properties during a parameter
fit at negligible additional cost. Through the construction of a series of
eight parameterizations SLy5s1-SLy5s8 of the standard Skyrme EDF with
systematically varied a_surf value it is shown how to arrive at a fit with
realistic deformation properties.

the Karman constant to 0.45 is set for the overlap region with a logarithmic
MVP. Second, a wake parameter models the turbulent transport near the
centerline. Third, an anomalous dissipation factor represents the effect of a
meso layer in the overlap region. Then, a highly accurate (above 99\%)

Americas, rapidly expanding its global geographic range in explosive outbreaks.
Unusual among mosquito-borne diseases, ZIKV has been shown to also be sexually
transmitted, although sustained autochthonous transmission due to sexual
transmission alone has not been observed, indicating the reproduction number
(R0) for sexual transmission alone is less than 1. Critical to the assessment
of outbreak risk, estimation of the potential attack rates, and assessment of
control measures, are estimates of the basic reproduction number, R0. Methods:
We estimated the R0 of the 2015 ZIKV outbreak in Barranquilla, Colombia,
through an analysis of the exponential rise in clinically identified ZIKV cases
(n = 359 to the end of November, 2015). Findings: The rate of exponential rise
in cases was rho=0.076 days-1, with 95 percent CI [0.066,0.087] days-1. We used
a vector-borne disease model with additional direct transmission to estimate
the R0; assuming the R0 of sexual transmission alone is less than 1, we
estimated the total R0 = 3.8 [2.4,5.6], and that the fraction of cases due to
sexual transmission was 0.23 [0.01,0.47] with 95 percent confidence.
Interpretation: This is among the first estimates of R0 for a ZIKV outbreak in
the Americas, and also among the first quantifications of the relative impact
of sexual transmission.

trajectories in a network of synchronized oscillators. Our system, consisting
of nonlinear amplitude-phase oscillators arranged in a ring topology with
reactive nearest neighbor coupling, is simple and connects directly to
experimental realizations. We seek to understand how the multiple stable
synchronized states connect to each other in state space by applying Gaussian
white noise to each of the oscillators' phases. To do this, we first identify a
set of locally stable limit cycles at any given coupling strength. For each of
these attracting states, we analyze the effect of weak noise via the covariance
matrix of deviations around those attractors. We then explore the noise-induced
attractor switching behavior via numerical investigations. For a ring of three
oscillators we find that an attractor-switching event is always accompanied by
the crossing of two adjacent oscillators' phases. For larger numbers of
oscillators we find that the distribution of times required to stochastically
leave a given state falls off exponentially, and we build an attractor
switching network out of the destination states as a coarse-grained description
of the high-dimensional attractor-basin architecture.

of mobile devices and the adoption of BYOD (Bring Your Own Device). Thus, this
research-in-progress paper examines the role of the behavior of mobile workers
that engage in accidental knowledge leakage through the use of BYOD. We use the
Decomposed Theory of Planned Behavior (DTPB) to explain the causes behind this
phenomenon and how it negatively impacts organization's competitive advantage.
The contributions of this study are the following. First, it posits that the
reasons of knowledge leakage by mobile workers through BYOD can be explained
using DTPB. Second, the paper proposes a conceptual model for research based on
DTPB constructs whilst adding other variables such as BYOD and mobile device

  (Technical Report)","Full version of CAV'16 paper",,,,"cs.LO cs.PL","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We consider the problem of verifying liveness for systems with a finite, but
unbounded, number of processes, commonly known as parameterised systems.
Typical examples of such systems include distributed protocols (e.g. for the
dining philosopher problem). Unlike the case of verifying safety, proving
liveness is still considered extremely challenging, especially in the presence
of randomness in the system. In this paper we consider liveness under arbitrary
(including unfair) schedulers, which is often considered a desirable property
in the literature of self-stabilising systems. We introduce an automatic method
of proving liveness for randomised parameterised systems under arbitrary
schedulers. Viewing liveness as a two-player reachability game (between
Scheduler and Process), our method is a CEGAR approach that synthesises a
progress relation for Process that can be symbolically represented as a
finite-state automaton. The method is incremental and exploits both
Angluin-style L*-learning and SAT-solvers. Our experiments show that our
algorithm is able to prove liveness automatically for well-known randomised
distributed protocols, including Lehmann-Rabin Randomised Dining Philosopher
Protocol and randomised self-stabilising protocols (such as the Israeli-Jalfon
Protocol). To the best of our knowledge, this is the first fully-automatic
method that can prove liveness for randomised protocols.

applications. However, most of the existing methods for dehazing are designed

from the imaging conditions in the daytime, images captured in nighttime haze
condition may suffer from non-uniform illumination due to artificial light
sources, which exhibit low brightness/contrast and color distortion. In this
paper, we present a new nighttime hazy imaging model that takes into account
both the non-uniform illumination from artificial light sources and the
scattering and attenuation effects of haze. Accordingly, we propose an
efficient dehazing algorithm for nighttime hazy images. The proposed algorithm
includes three sequential steps. i) It enhances the overall brightness by
performing a gamma correction step after estimating the illumination from the
original image. ii) Then it achieves a color-balance result by performing a
color correction step after estimating the color characteristics of the
incident light. iii) Finally, it remove the haze effect by applying the dark
channel prior and estimating the point-wise environmental light based on the
previous illumination-balance result. Experimental results show that the
proposed algorithm can achieve illumination-balance and haze-free results with
good color rendition ability.

  The SpectraVVave code uses a continuation method coupled with a spectral
projection to compute approximations of steady symmetric solutions of this
equation. The code is used in a number of situations to gain an understanding
of traveling-wave solutions. The first case is the Whitham equation, where
numerical evidence points to the conclusion that the main bifurcation branch
features three distinct points of interest, namely a turning point, a point of
stability inversion, and a terminal point which corresponds to a cusped wave.
  The second case is the so-called modified Benjamin-Ono equation where the
interaction of two solitary waves is investigated. It is found that is possible
for two solitary waves to interact in such a way that the smaller wave is
annihilated. The third case concerns the Benjamin equation which features two
competing dispersive operators. In this case, it is found that bifurcation
curves of periodic traveling-wave solutions may cross and connect high up on

Intra-night CCD monitoring of the 10 RQWLQs was carried out in 18 sessions

the observed INOV events (which occurred in just two of the sessions) are
strong (with a fractional variability amplitude $\psi >$ 10\%), hence
blazar-like. We briefly point out the prospects of an appreciable rise in the

FeSe monolayer films grown on SrTiO$_{3}$ (STO), as compared to 8 K in bulk

A$_{x}$Fe$_{2-y}$Se$_{2}$ and potassium doped FeSe, which also have a
relatively high superconducting critical temperature ($T_c$), the Fermi surface
(FS) of the FeSe/STO monolayer films is free of hole-like FS, suggesting that a
Lifshitz transition by which these hole FSs vanish may help increasing $T_c$.
However, the fundamental reasons explaining this increase of $T_c$ remain
unclear. Here we report a 15 K jump of $T_c$ accompanying a second Lifshitz
transition, characterized by the emergence of an electron pocket at the
Brillouin zone (BZ) centre, that is triggered by high electron doping following
in-situ deposition of potassium on FeSe/STO monolayer films. Our results
suggest that the pairing interactions are orbital-dependent with the $d_{xy}$
orbital playing a determining role in generating enhanced superconductivity in
FeSe.

properties of low-mass galaxies are currently still under large debate. In this
article, we study the stellar and gaseous properties of faint, low-mass
galaxies at z>3. We observed the Frontier Fields cluster Abell S1063 with MUSE
over a 2 arcmin^2 field, and combined integral-field spectroscopy with
gravitational lensing to perform a blind search for intrinsically faint Lya
emitters (LAEs). We determined in total the redshift of 172 galaxies of which
14 are lensed LAEs at z=3-6.1. We increased the number of
spectroscopically-confirmed multiple-image families from 6 to 17 and updated
our gravitational-lensing model accordingly. The lensing-corrected Lya
luminosities are with L(Lya) <= 10^41.5 erg/s among the lowest for
spectroscopically confirmed LAEs at any redshift. We used expanding gaseous
shell models to fit the Lya line profile, and find low column densities and
expansion velocities. This is to our knowledge the first time that gaseous
properties of such faint galaxies at z>=3 are reported. We performed SED
modelling to broadband photometry from the U-band through the infrared to
determine the stellar properties of these LAEs. The stellar masses are very low
(10^{6-8} Msun), and are accompanied by very young ages of 1-100 Myr. The very
high specific star formation rates (~100 Gyr^-1) are characteristic of
starburst galaxies. The UV-continuum slopes beta are low in our sample, with
beta<-2 for all galaxies with M_star<10^8 Msun. We conclude that our low-mass
galaxies at 3<z<6 are forming stars at higher rates when correcting for stellar
mass effects than seen locally or in more massive galaxies. The young stellar
populations with high star-formation rates and low HI column densities lead to
continuum slopes and LyC-escape fractions expected for a scenario where low
mass galaxies reionise the Universe.

intervention science. One way to formalize precision medicine is through a
treatment regime, which is a sequence of decision rules, one per stage of
clinical intervention, that map up-to-date patient information to a recommended
treatment. An optimal treatment regime is defined as maximizing the mean of
some cumulative clinical outcome if applied to a population of interest. It is
well-known that even under simple generative models an optimal treatment regime
can be a highly nonlinear function of patient information. Consequently, a
focal point of recent methodological research has been the development of
flexible models for estimating optimal treatment regimes. However, in many
settings, estimation of an optimal treatment regime is an exploratory analysis
intended to generate new hypotheses for subsequent research and not to directly
dictate treatment to new patients. In such settings, an estimated treatment
regime that is interpretable in a domain context may be of greater value than
an unintelligible treatment regime built using ""black-box"" estimation methods.
We propose an estimator of an optimal treatment regime composed of a sequence
of decision rules, each expressible as a list of ""if-then"" statements that can
be presented as either a paragraph or as a simple flowchart that is immediately
interpretable to domain experts. The discreteness of these lists precludes
smooth, i.e., gradient-based, methods of estimation and leads to non-standard
asymptotics. Nevertheless, we provide a computationally efficient estimation
algorithm, prove consistency of the proposed estimator, and derive rates of
convergence. We illustrate the proposed methods using a series of simulation
examples and application to data from a sequential clinical trial on bipolar
disorder.

complex vector nature resulting in a process which is dependant on the axis
under which the deconvolution is performed. We present here an improved method,
`Generalised Complex CLEAN', which properly accounts for the complex vector
nature of polarised emission and is invariant under rotations of the
deconvolution axis. We use two Australia Telescope Compact Array datasets to
test standard and complex CLEAN versions of the H\""{o}gbom and SDI CLEAN
algorithms. We show that in general the Complex CLEAN version of each algorithm
produces more accurate clean components with fewer spurious detections and
lower computation cost due to reduced iterations than the current methods. In
particular we find that the Complex SDI CLEAN produces the best results for
diffuse polarised sources as compared with standard CLEAN algorithms and other
Complex CLEAN algorithms. Given the move to widefield, high resolution
polarimetric imaging with future telescopes such as the Square Kilometre Array,
we suggest that Generalised Complex CLEAN should be adopted as the

can be a substantial fraction of dark matter if their mass is around
$10^{-5}$eV. The creation mechanism makes the vector bosons' energy spectral
density $\rho_{cdm}/\Delta E$ very high. Therefore, the dark electric dipole
transition rate in atoms is boosted if the energy gap between atomic states
equals the mass of the vector bosons. By using the Zeeman effect, the energy
gap between the 2S state and the 2P state in hydrogen atoms or hydrogen like
ions can be tuned. The $2S$ state can be populated with electrons due to its
relatively long life, which is about $1/7$s. When the energy gap between the
semi-ground $2S$ state and the 2P state matches the mass of the cosmic vector
bosons, induced transitions occur and the 2P state subsequently decays into the
1S state. The $2P\to1S$ decay emitted Lyman-$\alpha$ photons can then be
registered. The choices of target atoms depend on the experimental facilities
and the mass ranges of the vector bosons. Because the mass of the vector boson
is connected to the inflation scale, the proposed experiment may provide a
probe to inflation.

provide a way to explore the physics of the ULXs. We construct a conical
outflow model, and calculate the thermal X-ray Fe emission lines from the
outflows. Our results show that thermal line luminosity decreases with
increasing outflow velocity or/and opening angle of the outflow for a fixed
kinetic power of the outflows. Assuming the kinetic power of the outflows to be
comparable with the accretion power in the ULXs, we find that the equivalent
width can be several eV for the thermal X-ray Fe emission line from the
outflows in the ULXs with stellar mass black holes. The thermal line luminosity
is proportional to 1/M (M is the black hole mass of the ULX). The equivalent
width decreases with the black hole mass, which implies that the Fe line
emission from the outflows can hardly be detected if the ULXs contain
intermediate mass black holes. Our results suggest that the thermal X-ray Fe
line emission should be preferentially be detected in the ULXs with high
kinetic power slowly moving outflows from the accretion disks surrounding
stellar mass black holes/neutron stars. The recent observed X-ray atomic
features of the outflows in the ULX may imply that it contains a stellar mass
black hole/neutron star (Pinto et al. 2016).

an ability to reproduce well-known log return time series and central limit

calibration framework to a simple model of high- and low-frequency trader

turns out that the limiting cumulant generating functions of our functional and

missing entries of data represented by tensors. The approach is based on the
tensor train (TT) rank, which is able to capture hidden information from
tensors thanks to its definition from a well-balanced matricization scheme.
Accordingly, new optimization formulations for tensor completion are proposed
as well as two new algorithms for their solution. The first one called simple
low-rank tensor completion via tensor train (SiLRTC-TT) is intimately related
to minimizing a nuclear norm based on TT rank. The second one is from a
multilinear matrix factorization model to approximate the TT rank of a tensor,
and is called tensor completion by parallel matrix factorization via tensor
train (TMac-TT). A tensor augmentation scheme of transforming a low-order
tensor to higher-orders is also proposed to enhance the effectiveness of
SiLRTC-TT and TMac-TT. Simulation results for color image and video recovery
show the clear advantage of our method over all other methods.

a functional analytic integral representation of the associated propagator
using the spectral theorem for unbounded self-adjoint operators, Stone's
formula, and quantities arising in the analysis of Chandrasekhar's separation
of variables. This integral representation describes the dynamics of Dirac
particles outside and across the event horizon, up to the Cauchy horizon. In
the derivation, we first write the Dirac equation in Hamiltonian form and show
the essential self-adjointness of the Hamiltonian. For the latter purpose, as
the Dirac Hamiltonian fails to be elliptic at the event and the Cauchy horizon,
we cannot use standard elliptic methods of proof. Instead, we employ a new,
general method for mixed initial-boundary value problems that combines results
from the theory of symmetric hyperbolic systems with near-boundary elliptic
methods. In this regard and since the time evolution may not be unitary because
of Dirac particles impinging on the ring singularity, we also impose a suitable
Dirichlet-type boundary condition on a time-like inner hypersurface placed
inside the Cauchy horizon, which has no effect on the dynamics outside the
Cauchy horizon. We then compute the resolvent of the Dirac Hamiltonian via the
projector onto a finite-dimensional, invariant spectral eigenspace of the
angular operator and the radial Green's matrix stemming from Chandrasekhar's
separation of variables. Applying Stone's formula to the spectral measure of
the Hamiltonian in the spectral decomposition of the Dirac propagator, that is,
by expressing the spectral measure in terms of this resolvent, we obtain an
explicit integral representation of the propagator.

what extent does environment affect the properties of galaxies and haloes. The
present paper aims at shedding light on this problem. The paper focuses on the
analysis of a dark matter only simulation and it addresses the issue of how the
environment affects the abundance of haloes, which are are assigned four
attributes: their virial mass, an ambient density calculated with an aperture
that scales with $R_{vir}$ ($\Delta_M$), a fixed-aperture ($\Delta_R$) ambient
density, and a cosmic web classification (i.e. voids, sheets, filaments, and
knots, as defined by the V--web algorithm). $\Delta_M$ is the mean density
around a halo evaluated within a sphere of a radius of $5$\rvir, where \rvir\
is the virial radius. $\Delta_R$ is the density field Gaussian smoothed with
$R=4h^{-1}$Mpc, evaluated at the center of the halo.
  The main result of the paper is that the difference between haloes in
different web elements stems from the difference in their mass functions, and
does not depend on their adaptive-aperture ambient density. A dependence on the
fixed-aperture ambient density is induced by the cross correlation between the
mass of a halo and its fixed-aperture ambient density.

has attracted attention because peculiar spatial and kinematic configurations
have been detected in some systems. A particularly striking example of such
behavior is seen in the satellite system of the Andromeda galaxy, where around
80\% are on the nearside of that galaxy, facing the Milky Way. Motivated by
this departure from anisotropy, we examined the spatial distribution of
satellites around pairs of galaxies in the SDSS. By stacking tens of thousands
of satellites around galaxy pairs we found that satellites tend to bulge
towards the other central galaxy, preferably occupying the space between the
pair, rather than being spherically or axis-symmetrically distributed around
each host. The bulging is a function of the opening angle examined and is
fairly strong -- there are up to $\sim$10\% more satellites in the space
between the pair, than expected from uniform. Consequently, it is a
statistically very strong signal, being inconsistent with a uniform
distribution at the 5$\sigma$ level. The possibility that the observed signal
is the result of the overlap of two haloes with extended satellite
distributions, is ruled out by testing this hypothesis by performing the same
tests on isolated galaxies (and their satellites) artificially placed at
similar separations. These findings highlight the unrelaxed and interacting
nature of galaxies in pairs.

we present a deep learning approach for block-based CS, in which a

Photodetachment of stored anions was used in the beam lifetime measurements.
The detachment rate by anion collisions with residual-gas molecules was found

that the Lelong numbers and multiplier ideal sheaves of
$\theta$-plurisubharmonic functions with full mass are the same as those of the
current with minimal singularities. Second, given another big and nef class
$\{\eta\}$, we show the inclusion $\mathcal{E}(X,\eta) \cap {PSH}(X,\theta)
\subset \mathcal{E}(X,\theta).$ Third, we characterize big classes whose full
mass currents are ""additive"". Our techniques make use of a characterization of
full mass currents in terms of the envelope of their singularity type. As an
essential ingredient we also develop the theory of weak geodesics in big
cohomology classes. Numerous applications of our results to complex geometry
are also given.

functions, can be stabilized in the Heisenberg model on the kagome lattice. We
perform very accurate variational calculations and confirm with unprecedented
accuracy the fact, that the $\mathbb{Z}_{2}$ spin liquid is a local energy
minimum that goes away with system size, thus reaffirming the scenario of a
gapless $U(1)$ Dirac spin liquid ground state.

  Sharing Systems","19 pages, 2 figures",,,,"cs.PF math.OC math.PR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  During the last decade bike sharing systems have emerged as a public
transport mode in urban short trips in more than 500 major cities around the
world. For the mobility service mode, many challenges from its operations are
not well addressed yet, for example, how to develop the bike sharing systems to
be able to effectively satisfy the fluctuating demands both for bikes and for
vacant lockers. To this end, it is a key to give performance analysis of the
bike sharing systems. This paper first describes a large-scale bike sharing
system. Then the bike sharing system is abstracted as a closed queueing network
with multi-class customers, where the virtual customers and the virtual nodes
are set up, and the service rates as well as the relative arrival rates are
established. Finally, this paper gives a product-form solution to the steady
state joint probabilities of queue lengths, and gives performance analysis of
the bike sharing system. Therefore, this paper provides a unified framework for
analyzing closed queueing networks in the study of bike sharing systems. We
hope the methodology and results of this paper can be applicable in the study
of more general bike sharing systems.

particle physics and gravitation, i.e., in the subject investigated by
Prof.~K.~P.~Staniukovich half a century ago. Specifically, the inflationary
stage of the Universe evolution, originating from the vacuum polarization and
particle creation, corrections to Newton's gravitational law due to exchange of
light elementary particles or spontaneous compactification of extra dimensions,
and constraints on the parameters of axions as probable constituents of dark
matter in our Universe are considered. It is pointed out that presently the
relationship between elementary particles and gravitation has become an
experimental science, and many experiments, directed towards resolution of all
related problems, are performed in many countries.
