multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) channels, and in particular for
finite-alphabet signals. Based on an asymptotic expression for the mutual
information of channels exhibiting line-of-sight components and rather general
antenna correlations, precoding structures that decompose the general channel
into a set of parallel subchannel pairs are proposed. Then, a low-complexity
iterative algorithm is devised to maximize the sum mutual information of all
pairs. The proposed algorithm significantly reduces the computational load of
existing approaches with only minimal loss in performance. The complexity
savings increase with the number of transmit antennas and with the cardinality
of the signal alphabet, making it possible to support values thereof that were
unmanageable with existing solutions. Most importantly, the proposed solution
does not require instantaneous channel state information (CSI) at the
transmitter, but only statistical CSI.

the social interactions of individuals in a population. The Bass diffusion
model has been widely used to model the temporal evolution of adoption in such
social systems. In the model, the likelihood of a new adoption is proportional
to the number of previous adopters, implicitly assuming a global (or
homogeneous) interaction among all individuals in the network. Such global
interactions do not exist in many large social networks, however. Instead,
individuals typically interact with a small part of the larger population. To
quantify the growth rate (or equivalently the adoption timing) in networks with
limited interactions, we study a stochastic adoption process where the
likelihood that each individual adopts is proportional to the number of
adopters among the small group of persons he/she interacts with (and not the
entire population of adopters). When the underlying network of interactions is
a random $k$-regular graph, we compute the sample path limit of the fraction of
adopters. We show the limit coincides with the solution of a differential
equation which can viewed as a generalization of the Bass diffusion model. When
the degree $k$ is bounded, we show the adoption curve differs significantly
from the one corresponds to the Bass diffusion model. In particular, the
adoption grows more slowly than what the Bass model projects. In addition, the
adoption curve is asymmetric, unlike that of the Bass diffusion model. Such
asymmetry has important consequences for the estimation of market potential.
Finally, we calculate the timing of early adoptions at finer scales, e.g.,
logarithmic in the population size.

postulated in a class of semi-metals with a non-trivial energy dispersion.These
materials are now commonly dubbed Weyl semi-metals (WSM).One predicted property
of Weyl fermions is the chiral or Adler-Bell-Jackiw anomaly, a chirality
imbalance in the presence of parallel magnetic and electric fields. In WSM, it
is expected to induce a negative longitudinal magnetoresistance (NMR), the
chiral magnetic effect.Here, we present experimental evidence that the
observation of the chiral magnetic effect can be hindered by an effect called
""current jetting"". This effect also leads to a strong apparent NMR, but it is
characterized by a highly non-uniform current distribution inside the sample.
It appears in materials possessing a large field-induced anisotropy of the
resistivity tensor, such as almost compensated high-mobility semimetals due to
the orbital effect.In case of a non-homogeneous current injection, the
potential distribution is strongly distorted in the sample.As a consequence, an
experimentally measured potential difference is not proportional to the
intrinsic resistance.Our results on the MR of the WSM candidate materials NbP,
NbAs, TaAs, TaP exhibit distinct signatures of an inhomogeneous current
distribution, such as a field-induced ""zero resistance' and a strong dependence
of the `measured resistance"" on the position, shape, and type of the voltage
and current contacts on the sample. A misalignment between the current and the
magnetic-field directions can even induce a ""negative resistance"".
Finite-element simulations of the potential distribution inside the sample,
using typical resistance anisotropies, are in good agreement with the
experimental findings. Our study demonstrates that great care must be taken
before interpreting measurements of a NMR as evidence for the chiral anomaly in
putative Weyl semimetals.

microscopic model of a structured environment (a crystal) sensed by two bosonic

driving cavitation in water remains unknown. Using computer simulations, we
investigate the structure and dynamics of vapor bubbles emerging from
metastable water at negative pressures. We find that in the early stages of
cavitation, bubbles are irregularly shaped and become more spherical as they
grow. Nevertheless, the free energy of bubble formation can be perfectly
reproduced in the framework of classical nucleation theory (CNT) if the
curvature dependence of the surface tension is taken into account. Comparison
of the observed bubble dynamics to the predictions of the macroscopic
Rayleigh--Plesset (RP) equation, augmented with thermal fluctuations,
demonstrates that the growth of nanoscale bubbles is governed by viscous
forces. Combining the dynamical prefactor determined from the RP equation with
the free energy of CNT yields an analytical expression for the cavitation rate
that reproduces the simulation results very well over a wide range of
pressures. Furthermore, our theoretical predictions are in excellent agreement
with cavitation rates obtained from inclusion experiments. This suggests that
homogeneous nucleation is observed in inclusions, whereas only heterogeneous
nucleation on impurities or defects occurs in other experiments.

in many applications. These models use the power of the Long Short-Term Memory
(LSTM) architecture to capture the full dependence among variables, unlike
earlier models like CRFs that typically assumed conditional independence among
non-adjacent variables. However in practice encoder-decoder models exhibit a
bias towards short sequences that surprisingly gets worse with increasing beam
size.
  In this paper we show that such phenomenon is due to a discrepancy between
the full sequence margin and the per-element margin enforced by the locally
conditioned training objective of a encoder-decoder model. The discrepancy more
adversely impacts long sequences, explaining the bias towards predicting short
sequences.
  For the case where the predicted sequences come from a closed set, we show
that a globally conditioned model alleviates the above problems of
encoder-decoder models. From a practical point of view, our proposed model also
eliminates the need for a beam-search during inference, which reduces to an
efficient dot-product based search in a vector-space.

rising phase, it is the weakest of the last 100 years, and it presents two

wide wavelength range are needed. In this work we use the 17~GHz radio
continuum, formed in the upper chromosphere and the EUV lines 304 and
171~{\AA}, that come from the transition region (He II) and the corona (Fe IX,
X), respectively. We analyze daily images at 304 and 171~{\AA} obtained by the
Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA). The 17~GHz maps were obtained by the
Nobeyama Radioheliograph (NoRH). To construct synoptic limb charts, we
calculated the mean emission of delimited limb areas with 100"" wide and angular
separation of $5^\circ$. At the equatorial region, the results show an
hemispheric asymmetry of the solar activity. The northern hemisphere dominance
is coincident with the first sunspot number peak, whereas the second peak
occurs concurrently with the increase in the activity at the south. The polar
emission reflects the presence of coronal holes at both EUV wavelengths,
moreover, the 17~GHz polar brightenings can be associated with the coronal
holes. Until 2013, both EUV coronal holes and radio polar brightenings were
more predominant at the south pole. Since then they have not been apparent in
the north, but thus appear in the beginning of 2015 in the south as observed in
the synoptic charts. This work strengthens the association between coronal
holes and the 17~GHz polar brightenings as it is evident in the synoptic limb
charts, in agreement with previous case study papers. The enhancement of the
radio brightness in coronal holes is explained by the presence of bright
patches closely associated with the presence of intense unipolar magnetic
fields.

These are the first such results obtained from an analysis that simultaneously
accounts for selection effects and the underlying mass function, and directly
incorporates lensing data to constrain total masses. Our constraints on the
scaling relations and their intrinsic scatters are in good agreement with
previous studies, and reinforce a picture in which departures from self-similar
scaling laws are primarily limited to cluster cores. However, the data are
beginning to reveal new features that have implications for cluster
astrophysics and provide new tests for hydrodynamical simulations. We find a
positive correlation in the intrinsic scatters of luminosity and temperature at
fixed mass, which is related to the dynamical state of the clusters. While the
evolution of the nominal scaling relations over the redshift range $0.0<z<0.5$
is consistent with self similarity, we find tentative evidence that the
luminosity and temperature scatters respectively decrease and increase with
redshift. Physically, this likely related to the development of cool cores and
the rate of major mergers. We also examine the scaling relations of redMaPPer
richness and Compton $Y$ from Planck. While the richness--mass relation is in
excellent agreement with recent work, the measured $Y$--mass relation departs
strongly from that assumed in the Planck cluster cosmology analysis. The latter
result is consistent with earlier comparisons of lensing and Planck
scaling-relation-derived masses.

radiatively induced electroweak scale; intriguingly the global symmetry of the

surface area and surfaces enclosed volumes are highly correlated to each
others, and poorly correlated to various curvatures for six test sets of
molecules. Different curvatures are weakly correlated to each other for six
test sets of molecules, but are strongly correlated to each other within each
test set of molecules. Based on correlation analysis, we construct twenty six
nontrivial nonpolar solvation models. Our numerical results reveal that the
Lennard-Jones (LJ) potential plays a vital role in nonpolar solvation modeling,
especially for molecules involving strong van der Waals interactions. It is
found that curvatures are at least as important as surface area or surface
enclosed volume in nonpolar solvation modeling. In conjugation with the GPB
model, various curvature based nonpolar solvation models are shown to offer
some of the best solvation free energy predictions for a wide range of test
sets. For example, root mean square errors from a model constituting surface
area, volume, mean curvature and LJ potential are less than 0.42 kcal/mol for
all test sets.

unique constraints in partitioning such protein graphs. We therefore present

Square Kilometre Array, we scrutinise synergies between cosmic shear
measurements in the radio and optical/near-IR bands for mitigating systematic
effects. We focus on three main classes of systematics: (i) experimental
systematic errors in the observed shear; (ii) signal contamination by intrinsic
alignments; and (iii) systematic effects due to an incorrect modelling of
non-linear scales. First, we show that a comprehensive, multi-wavelength
analysis provides a self-calibration method for experimental systematic
effects, only implying <50% increment on the errors on cosmological parameters.
We also illustrate how the cross-correlation between radio and optical/near-IR
surveys alone is able to remove residual systematics with variance as large as
0.00001, i.e. the same order of magnitude of the cosmological signal. This also
opens the possibility of using such a cross-correlation as a means to detect
unknown experimental systematics. Secondly, we demonstrate that, thanks to
polarisation information, radio weak lensing surveys will be able to mitigate
contamination by intrinsic alignments, in a way similar but fully complementary
to available self-calibration methods based on position-shear correlations.
Lastly, we illustrate how radio weak lensing experiments, reaching higher
redshifts than those accessible to optical surveys, will probe dark energy and
the growth of cosmic structures in regimes less contaminated by non-linearities
in the matter perturbations. For instance, the higher-redshift bins of radio
catalogues peak at z~0.8-1, whereas their optical/near-IR counterparts are
limited to z<0.5-0.7. This translates into having a cosmological signal 2 to 5
times less contaminated by non-linear perturbations.

reddening, neutral gas covering fraction (fcov(HI)), and the escape of ionizing
photons at high redshift. Our sample includes 933 galaxies at z~3, 121 of which
have very deep spectroscopic observations (>7 hrs) in the rest-UV
(lambda=850-1300 A) with Keck/LRIS. Based on the high covering fraction of
outflowing optically-thick HI indicated by the composite spectra of these
galaxies, we conclude that photoelectric absorption, rather than dust
attenuation, dominates the depletion of ionizing photons. By modeling the
composite spectra as the combination of an unattenuated stellar spectrum
including nebular continuum emission with one that is absorbed by HI and
reddened by a line-of-sight extinction, we derive an empirical relationship
between E(B-V) and fcov(HI). Galaxies with redder UV continua have larger
covering fractions of HI characterized by higher line-of-sight extinctions. Our
results are consistent with the escape of Lya through gas-free lines-of-sight.
Covering fractions based on low-ionization interstellar absorption lines
systematically underpredict those deduced from the HI lines, suggesting that
much of the outflowing gas may be metal-poor. We develop a model which connects
the ionizing escape fraction with E(B-V), and which may be used to estimate the
escape fraction for an ensemble of high-redshift galaxies. Alternatively,
direct measurements of the escape fraction for our data allow us to constrain
the intrinsic 900-to-1500 A flux density ratio to be >0.20, a value that favors
stellar population models that include weaker stellar winds, a flatter initial
mass function, and/or binary evolution. Lastly, we demonstrate how the
framework discussed here may be used to assess the pathways by which ionizing
radiation escapes from high-redshift galaxies. [Abridged]

anti-correlated with the angular velocity of the disk $\Omega$ for the three

of star formation is well represented by an exponentially decreasing function
of $-1.9\Omega t_{\rm ff}^{\rm ini}$, where $t_{\rm ff}^{\rm ini}$ is the

unavoidable resonances caused by photon absorption from the drive. We show how

multi-level Landau-Zener physics, leading to non-trivial consequences such as
the loss of adiabaticity upon slow ramping of the amplitude. We numerically
demonstrate that these oscillations are observable in the time-dependent Wigner

Our results apply generically to any system with surface states in the presence

electromagnetic field ( ZPF ) and with a polarization normal to the rotation
plane, is considered. Temporal periodicity conditions are imposed on ZPF,
associated with the way the rotating oscillator observes ZPF. They are similar
to spatial boundary conditions in Casimir phenomenon and therefore result in
ZPF spectrum change from continuous one to a discrete one and, as a
consequence, an effective temperature of the modified ZPF (Y. S. Levin ). The
average centripetal average force on the oscillator, originating from this
modified ZPF scattered by the oscillator in the near zone, is calculated in
terms of the bilinear correlation functions of electromagnetic field. After
renormalization of the correlation function, which physically means extraction
of a pure effect of periodicity, the force has a finite value. All calculations
are carried out using the methodology of stochastic electrodynamics. The radial
component of the force is directed to the center of rotation. In non
relativistic case and for oscillator frequency smaller than rotation frequency,
the force turns out to be proportional to the rotation radius. Such result
could mean a possibility that micro motion of the oscillator in ZPF sustains
its average circular motion without any other external forces.Though the
estimation done for the point-like electron shows that the effect is not
observable because the radius of such circular electron motion would have been
much smaller than the classical electron radius when our semi classical
approach to the electromagnetic problem does not work. It is well expected
result and considered as the first step in the application of the idea in the

subhalos cause structure on smaller scales. The time-dependence of impacts and
of the evolution of the stream after an impact gives rise to bispectra. We
further find that tidal streams are essentially corrugated sheets in the
presence of subhalo perturbations: different projections of the track all
reflect the same pattern of perturbations, facilitating their observational
measurement. We apply this formalism to density data for the Pal 5 stream and
make a first rigorous determination of 10^{+11}_{-6} dark-matter subhalos with
masses between 3x10^6 and 10^9 Msun within 20 kpc from the Galactic center
(corresponding to 1.4^{+1.6}_{-0.9} times the number predicted by CDM-only
simulations or to f_{sub}(r<20 kpc) ~ 0.2%). Improved data will allow
measurements of the subhalo mass function down to 10^5 Msun, thus definitively
testing whether dark matter clumps on the smallest scales relevant for galaxy
formation.

analysis, signal processing, machine learning, theoretical neuroscience and
many other fields. In an overcomplete representation, the number of latent
features exceeds the data dimensionality, which is useful when the data is
undersampled by the measurements (compressed sensing, information bottlenecks
in neural systems) or composed from multiple complete sets of linear features,
each spanning the data space. Independent Components Analysis (ICA) is a linear
technique for learning sparse latent representations, which typically has a
lower computational cost than sparse coding, its nonlinear, recurrent
counterpart. While well suited for finding complete representations, we show
that overcompleteness poses a challenge to existing ICA algorithms.
Specifically, the coherence control in existing ICA algorithms, necessary to
prevent the formation of duplicate dictionary features, is ill-suited in the
overcomplete case. We show that in this case several existing ICA algorithms
have undesirable global minima that maximize coherence. Further, by comparing
ICA algorithms on synthetic data and natural images to the computationally more
expensive sparse coding solution, we show that the coherence control biases the
exploration of the data manifold, sometimes yielding suboptimal solutions. We
provide a theoretical explanation of these failures and, based on the theory,
propose improved overcomplete ICA algorithms. All told, this study contributes
new insights into and methods for coherence control for linear ICA, some of
which are applicable to many other, potentially nonlinear, unsupervised
learning methods.

critical information for medical investigations. However, the vast majority of
medical investigators can only access de-identified notes, in order to protect
the confidentiality of patients. In the United States, the Health Insurance
Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) defines 18 types of protected health
information (PHI) that needs to be removed to de-identify patient notes. Manual
de-identification is impractical given the size of EHR databases, the limited
number of researchers with access to the non-de-identified notes, and the
frequent mistakes of human annotators. A reliable automated de-identification
system would consequently be of high value.
  Materials and Methods: We introduce the first de-identification system based
on artificial neural networks (ANNs), which requires no handcrafted features or
rules, unlike existing systems. We compare the performance of the system with
state-of-the-art systems on two datasets: the i2b2 2014 de-identification
challenge dataset, which is the largest publicly available de-identification
dataset, and the MIMIC de-identification dataset, which we assembled and is
twice as large as the i2b2 2014 dataset.
  Results: Our ANN model outperforms the state-of-the-art systems. It yields an
F1-score of 97.85 on the i2b2 2014 dataset, with a recall 97.38 and a precision
of 97.32, and an F1-score of 99.23 on the MIMIC de-identification dataset, with
a recall 99.25 and a precision of 99.06.
  Conclusion: Our findings support the use of ANNs for de-identification of
patient notes, as they show better performance than previously published
systems while requiring no feature engineering.

generalize to the $O(N)$ theory a systematic method introduced previously for a
single field, which treats the zero modes exactly and the nonzero modes
perturbatively. We compute the two-point functions taking into account not only
the leading infrared contribution, coming from the self-interaction of the zero

For the model defined in the corresponding Lorentzian de Sitter spacetime, we
obtain the two-point functions by analytical continuation. We point out that a
partial resummation of the leading secular terms (which necessarily involves
nonzero modes) is required to obtain a decay at large distances for massless
fields. We implement this resummation along with a systematic double expansion
in an effective coupling constant $\sqrt\lambda$ and in 1/N. We explicitly
perform the calculation up to the next-to-next-to-leading order in
$\sqrt\lambda$ and up to next-to-leading order in 1/N. The results reduce to
those known in the leading infrared approximation. We also show that they
coincide with the ones obtained directly in Lorentzian de Sitter spacetime in

The key advantage of FermiFAST is that it constructs a catalogue of potential

structure. Using this structure FermiFAST rapidly finds the photons that could
have originated from a potential gamma-ray source. It calculates a likehihood
ratio for the contribution of the potential source using the angular

plane, all but eight of the 580 FermiFAST detections are associated with 3FGL
sources. And of these eight, six yield significant detections of greater than

nanostructuring also aids to strong enhancement of the emission from gold, by a
factor of 76 in our experiments. This enhancement is determined by the relative
position of the engineered absorption and emission lines to the exciting laser
wavelength and the intrinsic properties of the constituent material. These
luminescence-engineered materials combined with a resonant material, as in the
lasing spaser, or with the power of reconfigurable metamaterials promise huge
potential as tunable nanoscale light sources.

devices have been exploited for various applications, such as computational
offloading and mitigating cellular traffic load. In contrast to existing work,
in this paper, we focus on cooperatively offloading data among mobile devices
to maximally improve the probability of data delivery from a mobile device to
intermittently connected infrastructure within a given time constraint, which
is referred to as the \textit{cooperative offloading} problem. Unfortunately,
the estimation of data delivery probability over an opportunistic path is
difficult and cooperative offloading is NP-hard. To this end, we first propose
a probabilistic framework that provides the estimation of such probability.
Based on the proposed probabilistic framework, we design a heuristic algorithm
to solve cooperative offloading at a low computation cost. Due to the lack of
global information, a distributed algorithm is further proposed. The
performance of the proposed approaches is evaluated based on both synthetic
networks and real traces. Experimental results show that the probabilistic
framework can accurately estimate the data delivery probability, cooperative
offloading greatly improves the delivery probability, the heuristic algorithm
approximates the optimum, and the performance of both the heuristic algorithm
and distributed algorithm outperforms other approaches.

analyze the space of parameters at which hysteresis and oscillatory regimes can
be found.

nice relation to the standard contact structure on $\mathbb S^3$ and to

going, in particular, to develop a method to distinguish Legendrian knots. This
requires a lot of technical work of which the present paper addresses only the
first basic question: which isotopy classes of surfaces can be represented by a
rectangular diagram. Vaguely speaking the answer is this: there is no
restriction on the isotopy class of the surface, but there is a restriction on
the rectangular diagram of the boundary link that can arise from the
presentation of the surface. The result extends to Giroux's convex surfaces for
which this restriction on the boundary has a natural meaning. In a subsequent
paper we are going to consider transformations of rectangular diagrams of
surfaces and to study their properties. By using the formalism of rectangular
diagrams of surfaces we also produce here an annulus in $\mathbb S^3$ that we
expect to be a counterexample to the following conjecture: if two Legendrian
knots cobound an annulus and have zero Thurston--Bennequin numbers relative to
this annulus, then they are Legendrian isotopic.

sources with spectral types ranging from B3 to O5, but the majority of the fits
indicate stellar objects with B1 spectral types. We also present an extinction
map of IRS~2, showing that a region with lower extinction corresponds to the
region where a proposed jet of gas has impacted the foreground cloud. From this
map, we also derived the total extinction towards the enigmatic source IRS~2E,
which amounts to $\sim$60 magnitudes in the $V$ band. We calculated the color
temperature due to thermal emission of the circumstellar dust of the detected
sources; the temperatures are in the interval of $\sim$100 -- 150 K, which
corresponds to the emission of dust located at 0.1 pc from the central source.
Finally, we show a possible mid infrared counterpart of a detected source at mm
wavelengths that was found by \cite{zap08,zap09} to be a massive young stellar
object undergoing a high accretion rate.

DM particles can annihilate into charged particles. These annihilations will
proceed in e.g. Galactic subhalos such as dwarf Galaxies or, as recently
pointed out, high velocity clouds such as the ""Smith Cloud"". In this note, we
focus on the radio emission associated with DM annihilations into electrons and
positrons occurring in the Smith Cloud. The phenomenology of this emission is
discussed in quite some detail. We argue that the uncertainties in the
propagation can be captured by the typical diffusion-loss length parameter
(Syrovatskii variable) but that the angle-integrated radio fluxes are
independent of the propagation. We conclude that if the Smith Cloud is indeed
dominated by DM, radio signals from DM annihilation stand out amongst other
messengers. Furthermore, low frequencies such as the ones observed by e.g. the
Low Frequency Array (LOFAR) and the next-generation Square Kilometre Array
(SKA) are optimal for searches for DM in the Smith Cloud. As a practical
application, we set conservative constraints on dark matter annihilation cross
section using data of continuum radio emission from the Galaxy at 22 MHz and at
1.4 GHz. Stronger constraints could be reached by background subtraction,
exploiting the profile and frequency dependence of the putative DM signal. We
set stronger but tentative limits using the median noise in brightness
temperature from the Green Bank Telescope and the LOFAR sensitivities.

ilk) are strongly heated on the side facing the pulsar. However in high-quality
photometric and spectroscopic data the heating pattern does not match that
expected for direct pulsar illumination. Here we explore heating mediated by an
intra-binary shock (IBS). We develop a simple analytic model and implement it
in the popular `ICARUS' light curve code. The model is parameterized by the
wind momentum ratio beta and velocity v_Rel v_orb and assumes that the
reprocessed pulsar wind emits prompt particles or radiation to heat the
companion surface. We illustrate an interesting range of light curve
asymmetries controlled by these parameters. The code also computes the IBS
synchrotron emission pattern, and thus can model black widow X-ray light
curves. As a test we apply the results to the high quality asymmetric optical
light curves of PSR J2215+5135; the resulting fit gives a substantial
improvement upon direct heating models and produces an X-ray light curve
consistent with that seen. The IBS model parameters imply that, at the present
loss rate, the companion evaporation has a characteristic timescale tau_evap
~150My. Still, the model is not fully satisfactory, indicating additional
unmodeled physical effects.

models and mathematics, we can explore the impact of unstable poles and zeros,
delays, and noise, which can then be easily verified with simple experiments
using a standard extensible pointer. Despite its simplicity, this case study
has extremes of robustness and fragility that are initially counter-intuitive

With the assumption of internal gravity increasing linearly in the core, and
staying constant in the mantle, and tested against numerical simulations, a
simple model is constructed, applicable to rocky exoplanets of core mass
fraction (CMF) $\in 0.1\sim0.4$ and mass $\in 0.1 \sim 10 M_{\oplus}$. Various
scaling relations are derived: (1) core radius fraction $\rm CRF \approx
\sqrt{CMF}$, (2) Typical interior pressure $P_{\text{typical}} \sim
g_{\rm{s}}^2$ (surface gravity squared), (3) core formation energy $E_{\rm
diff} \sim \frac{1}{10} E_{\rm grav}$ (the total gravitational energy), (4)
effective heat capacity of the mantle $C_{\rm p}\approx \left(
\frac{M_{\rm{p}}}{M_{\oplus}} \right) \cdot 7 \cdot 10^{27}$ J K$^{-1}$, and
(5) the moment of inertia $I\approx \frac{1}{3} \cdot M_{\rm{p}} \cdot
R_{\rm{p}}^2$. These scaling relations, though approximate, are handy for quick
use owing to their simplicity and lucidity, and provide insights into the
interior structures of rocky exoplanets. As examples, this model is applied to
several planets including Earth, GJ 1132b, Kepler-93b, and Kepler-20b, and made

Variational principle is a fundamental principle in physics, entailing that a

alternative to the differential equation formulation of a physical system.
Applying this principle to planetary interior can beautifully summarize the set
of differential equations into one, which provides us some insight into the
problem. From it, a universal mass-radius relation, an estimate of error
propagation from equation of state to mass-radius relation, and a form of
virial theorem applicable to planetary interiors are derived.

that fundamentally shifts established ways in which we live and work. Given the
impact of digital disruption can span the individual, organisational, industry

A less researched area of digital disruption, however, is the perspective of IT
managers in organisations. This paper draws on i) situational awareness theory
to identify IT managers' perceptions of digital disruption, and ii) disruptive
innovation theory to identify IT managers' responses to digital disruption. A
case study of senior IT managers in an Australian university identifies that IT
managers perceive digital disruption from the technological, learning and
sense-making perspectives. IT managers' first-order responses to digital
disruption were shown to address resource, process and value-based issues while
second-order responses focused on the need to build dynamic capabilities in
order to be prepared for future digital disruption.

measurement of space filling of urban evolution. Based on empirical analyses, a
discovery is made that the time series of fractal dimension of urban form can
be treated as a sigmoid function of time. Among various sigmoid functions, the
logistic function is the most probable selection. However, how to use the model
of fractal dimension growth to explain and predict urban growth is a pending
problem remaining to be solved. This paper is devoted to modeling fractal
dimension evolution of different types of cities. A interesting discovery is as
follows: for the cities in developed countries such as UK, USA and Israel, the
comparable fractal dimension values of a city's morphology in different years
can be fitted to the logistic function; while for the cities in developing
countries such as China, the fractal dimension data of urban form can be fitted
to a quadratic logistic function. A generalized logistic function is thus
proposed to model fractal dimension growth of urban form. The logistic model
can also be employed to characterize the change of the dimensions of
multifractals. The generalized logistic models can be used to predict the
missing values of fractal dimension, to estimate the growth rate of the
dimension, and thus to reveal the spatio-temporal process and pattern of a
city's growth. Especially, the models lay a foundation for researching the
correlation between urban form and urbanization and for developing the theory
of spatial replacement dynamics.

defined by the generalized lasso regularization path. The generalized lasso
estimate is given by the solution of a penalized least squares regression
problem, where the penalty is the l1 norm of a matrix D times the coefficient
vector. The generalized lasso path collects these estimates for a range of
penalty parameter ({\lambda}) values. Leveraging a sequential characterization
of this path from Tibshirani & Taylor (2011), and recent advances in
post-selection inference from Lee et al. (2016), Tibshirani et al. (2016), we
develop exact hypothesis tests and confidence intervals for linear contrasts of
the underlying mean vector, conditioned on any model selection event along the
generalized lasso path (assuming Gaussian errors in the observations). By
inspecting specific choices of D, we obtain post-selection tests and confidence
intervals for specific cases of generalized lasso estimates, such as the fused
lasso, trend filtering, and the graph fused lasso. In the fused lasso case, the
underlying coordinates of the mean are assigned a linear ordering, and our
framework allows us to test selectively chosen breakpoints or changepoints in
these mean coordinates. This is an interesting and well-studied problem with
broad applications, our framework applied to the trend filtering and graph
fused lasso serves several applications as well. Aside from the development of
selective inference tools, we describe several practical aspects of our methods
such as valid post-processing of generalized estimates before performing
inference in order to improve power, and problem-specific visualization aids
that may be given to the data analyst for he/she to choose linear contrasts to
be tested. Many examples, both from simulated and real data sources, are

is yet poorly understood due to the difficulty of its quantification. For a
bumpy base made by spheres, at least two factors should be considered to
characterize its geometric roughness, namely the size ratio of base- to
flow-particles and the packing of base particles. In this paper, we propose a
definition of base roughness, Ra, which is a function of both the size ratio
and the packing arrangement of base particles. The function is generalized for
random and regular packing of multi-layered spheres, where the range of
possible values of Ra is studied, along with the optimal values to create
maximum base roughness. The new definition is applied to granular flows down
chute in both two- and three-dimensional configurations. It is proven to be a
good indicator of slip condi- tion, and a transition occurs from slip to
non-slip condition as Ra increases. Critical values of Ra are identified for

significantly altered by screening effects, either from free charge carriers in
the material itself, or by environmental screening from the surrounding medium.
The physical properties of 2D semiconductors placed in a heterostructure with
other 2D materials are therefore governed by a complex interplay of both intra-
and inter-layer interactions. Here, using time- and angle-resolved
photoemission, we are able to isolate both the layer-resolved band structure
and, more importantly, the transient band structure evolution of a model 2D
heterostructure formed of a single layer of MoS$_2$ on graphene. Our results
reveal a pronounced renormalization of the quasiparticle gap of the MoS$_2$
layer. Following optical excitation, the band gap is reduced by up to
$\sim\!$400 meV on femtosecond timescales due to a persistence of strong
electronic interactions despite the environmental screening by the $n$-doped
graphene. This points to a large degree of tuneability of both the electronic
structure and electron dynamics for 2D semiconductors embedded in a van der

driven against gravity into a density-inverted state, with a high-density

density-inverted structure and the relaxation dynamics between the phases can
amplify any small asymmetry between the columns, and lead to a giant

coupling strength, and the corresponding phase diagram can be universally
described with a characteristic height of the density-inverted structure. A
minimal two-phase model is proposed and linear stability analysis shows that
the triggering mechanism of the oscillation can be explained as a switchable
two-parameter Hopf bifurcation. Numerical solutions of the model also reproduce
similar oscillatory dynamics to the simulation results.

over time, a task referred to as story detection. Moreover, there are often
several different stories pertaining to a given event, which we refer to as
sub-stories and the corresponding task of their automatic detection as
sub-story detection. This paper proposes hierarchical Dirichlet processes
(HDP), a probabilistic topic model, as an effective method for automatic
sub-story detection. HDP can learn sub-topics associated with sub-stories which
enables it to handle subtle variations in sub-stories. It is compared with
state- of-the-art story detection approaches based on locality sensitive
hashing and spectral clustering. We demonstrate the superior performance of HDP
for sub-story detection on real world Twitter data sets using various

the sub- stories with high precision. Another contribution of this paper is in
demonstrating that the conversational structures within the Twitter stream can
be used to improve sub-story detection performance significantly.

We focus here on the important scaling relationship between the gross
metropolitan product (GMP) of a city and its population (pop). It has been
demonstrated that GMP $\propto$ Y pop $^{\beta}$ with $\beta$ always greater
than 1 and close to 1.2. This fundamental finding highlights a universal rule
that holds across countries and cultures and might explain the very nature of
cities. However, in an increasingly connected world, the hypothesis that the
economy of a city solely depends on its population might be questionable. Using
data for 248 cities in the European Union between 2005 and 2010, we found a
double GMP/pop scaling regime. For West EU cities, $\beta$ = 1 over the whole
the period, while for post-communist cities $\beta >$1 and increases from
$\sim$1.2 to $\sim$1.4. The evolution of the scaling exponent describes the
convergence of post-communist European cities to open and liberal economies. We
propose a simple model of economic convergence in which, under stable political
conditions, a linear GMP/pop scaling is expected for all cities. The results
suggest that the GMP/pop super-linear scaling represents a phase of economic
growth rather than a steady, universal urban feature. The results also suggest
that relationships between cities are embedded in their political and economic
context and cannot be neglected in explanations of cities, urbanization and
urban economics.

that takes into account not only the scheduling policies (as in the standard
wireline adversarial model), but also the transmission policies. First, we show
that any scheduling policy that is unstable in the classical wireline
adversarial model remains unstable in the multi-hop radio network model, even
in scenarios free of inter- ferences. Then, we show that both SIS and LIS (two
well-known universally stable scheduling policies in the wireline adversarial
model) remain stable in the multi-hop radio network model, provided a proactive
hearing control is used. In contrast, such scheduling policies turn out to be
unstable when using a reactive hearing control. However, the scheduling policy
LIS can be enforced to be universally stable provided ties are resolved in a
permanent manner. Such a situation doesn't hold in the case of SIS, which
remains unstable regardless of how ties are resolved. Furthermore, for some
transmission policies which we call regular, we also show that all scheduling
policies that are universally stable when using proactive hearing control

achieved by using ""smooth sensitivity"", which takes into account the specific

efficiency at the other end. Then the scintillation light emitted by any
neutron interaction is transmitted to one end, magnified, and recorded by an
intensified CCD camera. A simulation based on the Geant4 toolkit was developed
to model this detector. All the relevant physics processes including neutron
interaction, scintillation, and optical boundary behaviors are si\-mulated.
This simulation was first validated through measurements of neutron response
from lithium glass cylinders. With good expected light collection, an algorithm
based upon the features inherent to alpha and triton particle tracks is
proposed to reconstruct the neutron reaction position in the glass fiber array.
Given a 1\,$\mu$m fiber diameter and 0.1\,mm detector thickness, the neutron
spatial resolution is expected to reach $\sigma\sim 1\, \mu$m with a Gaussian
fit in each lateral dimension. The detection efficiency was estimated to be
3.7\% for a glass fiber assembly with thickness of 0.1\,mm. When the detector
thickness increases from 0.1\,mm to 1\,mm, the position resolution is not
expected to vary much, while the detection efficiency is expected to increase
by about a factor of ten.

characterize all bijective transformations on the projective space $P(H)$
obtained from $H$ which preserves the angle $\alpha$ between lines in both
directions. (We emphasize that we do not assume anything about other angles).
For real inner product spaces and when $H=\mathbb{C}^2$ we do this for every
$\alpha$, and when $H$ is a complex inner product space of dimension at least
three we describe the structure of these transformations for
$\alpha\leq\tfrac{\pi}{4}$. As an application, we give an Uhlhorn-type
generalization of a famous theorem of Wigner which is considered to be a
cornerstone of the mathematical foundations of quantum mechanics. Namely, we
show that under the above assumptions, every bijective map on the set of pure
states of a quantum mechanical system that preserves the transition probability
$\cos^2\alpha$ in both directions is a Wigner symmetry (i.e. it automatically
preserves all transition probability), except for the case when
$H=\mathbb{C}^2$ and $\alpha = \tfrac{\pi}{4}$ where an additional possibility
occurs. We note that the classical theorem of Uhlhorn is the solution for the
$\alpha = \tfrac{\pi}{2}$ case. Usually in the literature, results which are
connected to Wigner's theorem are discussed under the assumption of
completeness of $H$, however, here we shall remove this unnecessary hypothesis.
Our main tools are a characterization of bijective maps on unit spheres of real
inner product spaces which preserve an angle in both directions, and an
extension of Uhlhorn's theorem for non-complete inner product spaces.

the instance is known, it can be solved in polynomial time, but is this also
possible without knowing the instance? Bei, Chen and Zhang (STOC '13)
considered a model where the input is accessed by proposing possible
assignments to a special oracle. This oracle, on encountering some constraint
unsatisfied by the proposal, returns only the constraint index. It turns out
that, in this model, even 1SAT cannot be solved in polynomial time unless P=NP.
Hence, we consider a model in which the input is accessed by proposing
probability distributions over assignments to the variables. The oracle then
returns the index of the constraint that is most likely to be violated by this
distribution. We show that the information obtained this way is sufficient to
solve 1SAT in polynomial time, even when the clauses can be repeated. For 2SAT,
as long as there are no repeated clauses, in polynomial time we can even learn
an equivalent formula for the hidden instance and hence also solve it.
Furthermore, we extend these results to the quantum regime. We show that in
this setting 1QSAT can be solved in polynomial time up to constant precision,
and 2QSAT can be learnt in polynomial time up to inverse polynomial precision.

$\{\langle \alpha x^d \rangle\}$ fails to have Poissonian pair correlation is
at most $\frac{d+2}{d+3} < 1$. This strengthens a result of Rudnick and Sarnak

in the form of systemic risk. They create a network of interbank exposures by
which they expose other banks to potential insolvency cascades. In this paper,
we show how a regulator can use information about the financial network to
devise a transaction-specific tax based on a network centrality measure that
captures systemic importance. Since different transactions have different
impact on creating systemic risk, they are taxed differently. We call this tax
a Systemic Risk Tax (SRT). We use an equilibrium concept inspired by the
matching markets literature to show analytically that this SRT induces a unique
equilibrium matching of lenders and borrowers that is systemic-risk efficient,
i.e. it minimizes systemic risk given a certain transaction volume. On the
other hand, we show that without this SRT multiple equilibrium matchings exist,
which are generally inefficient. This allows the regulator to effectively
stimulate a `rewiring' of the equilibrium interbank network so as to make it
more resilient to insolvency cascades, without sacrificing transaction volume.
Moreover, we show that a standard financial transaction tax (e.g. a Tobin-like
tax) has no impact on reshaping the equilibrium financial network because it
taxes all transactions indiscriminately. A Tobin-like tax is indeed shown to
have a limited effect on reducing systemic risk while it decreases transaction
volume.

This study assesses the effect of bio-inspired hierarchical organization as
well as of viscoelasticity on the wave attenuation properties of continuous
mechanical metamaterials. We consider single-phase metamaterials formed by
self-similar unit cells with different hierarchical levels and types of
hierarchy. Results highlight a number of advantages through the introduction of
structural hierarchy. Band gaps relative to the corresponding non-hierarchical
structures are mostly preserved, while additional ""hierarchically-induced"" band
gaps appear. Additionally, the hierarchical configuration allows the tuning of
the band gap frequencies of regular metamaterial to lower frequencies, with a
simultaneous significant reduction of the global structural weight. We show
that even small viscoelastic effects, not treated in the current literature,
are essential in determining this behaviour. The approach we propose allows the
addition of hierarchical elements to existing metamaterial configurations, with
the corresponding improvement of the wave damping properties, thus providing
indications for the design of structures for practical applications.

the anchoring behavioral pattern. Anchoring as a heuristic bias causes
investors focusing on recent price changes and price levels, which two lead to
a belief in continuing trend and mean-reversion respectively. The empirical
results support our theoretical explanation through an analysis of large price
fluctuations in the S&P 500 and the resulting effects on implied and realized
volatility. These results indicate that asymmetry (a negative relationship)
between shocks and volatility in the subsequent period indeed exists. Moreover,
contrary to previous research, our empirical tests also suggest that implied
volatility is not simply an upward biased predictor of future deviation
compensating for the variance of the volatility but rather, due to investors
systematic anchoring to losses and gains in their volatility forecasts, it is a
co-integrated yet asymmetric over/under estimated financial instrument. We also
provide results indicating that the medium-term implied volatility (measured by
the VIX Index) is an unbiased though inefficient estimation of realized
volatility, while in contrast, the short-term volatility (measured by the
recently introduced VXST Index representing the 9-day implied volatility) is
also unbiased and yet efficient.

properties, many basic properties like average response time cannot be
expressed with weighted automata. Nested weighted automata extend weighted
automata and consist of a master automaton and a set of slave automata that are
invoked by the master automaton. Nested weighted automata are strictly more
expressive than weighted automata (e.g., average response time can be expressed
with nested weighted automata), but the basic decision questions have higher
complexity (e.g., for deterministic automata, the emptiness question for nested
weighted automata is PSPACE-hard, whereas the corresponding complexity for
weighted automata is PTIME). We consider a natural subclass of nested weighted
automata where at any point at most a bounded number k of slave automata can be
active. We focus on automata whose master value function is the limit average.
We show that these nested weighted automata with bounded width are strictly
more expressive than weighted automata (e.g., average response time with no
overlapping requests can be expressed with bound k=1, but not with non-nested
weighted automata). We show that the complexity of the basic decision problems
(i.e., emptiness and universality) for the subclass with k constant matches the
complexity for weighted automata. Moreover, when k is part of the input given

However, in polarization, diffuse Galactic radiation (synchrotron and thermal
dust) can be polarized at a level of >10 % making it more of a challenge. In
particular, CMB B-modes, which are a smoking-gun signature of inflation, will
be dominated by foregrounds. Component separation will therefore be critical
for future CMB polarization missions, requiring many channels covering a wide

theory of slice monogenic functions constructed by Colombo, Sabadini and
Struppa since 2009. Along with this generalization step, the larger class of
slice functions over A has been defined. We introduce here a new type of series
expansion near each singularity of a slice regular function. This instrument,
which is new even in the quaternionic case, leads to a complete classification
of singularities. This classification also relies on some recent developments
of the theory, concerning the algebraic structure and the zero sets of slice
functions. Peculiar phenomena arise, which were not present in the complex or
quaternionic case, and they are studied by means of new results on the topology
of the zero sets of slice functions. The analogs of meromorphic functions,
called (slice) semiregular functions, are introduced and studied.
