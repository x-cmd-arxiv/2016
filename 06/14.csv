to diagnose the thickness of the liquid at various locations in the vessel, as
a function of time, and possibly respond to counteract undesired bulging or
depletion. The electrical conductance between electrodes immersed in the liquid
metal can be used as a simple proxy for the local thickness. Here a matrix of
electrodes is shown to provide spatially resolved measurements of liquid metal

electrodes, and then it is experimentally demonstrated for 3x1 electrodes. The
experiments were carried out with Galinstan, but are easily extended to Lithium

studied with respect to various boundary effects. The free energy is
numerically calculated by Corner Transfer Matrix Renormalization Group method.
We analyze phase transitions of the Potts models in the thermodynamic limit
with respect to contracted boundary layers. A false phase transition is present
even if a couple of the boundary layers are contracted. Its significance
weakens, as the number of the contracted boundary layers increases, until the
correct phase transition (deep inside the bulk) prevails over the false one.
For this purpose we derive a thermodynamic quantity, the so-called bulk excess
free energy, which depends on the contracted boundary layers and memorizes
additional boundary effects. In particular, the magnetic field is imposed on
the outermost boundary layer. While the boundary magnetic field does not affect
the second-order phase transition in the bulk if suppressing all the boundary
effects on the hyperbolic lattices, the first-order (discontinuous) phase
transition is significantly sensitive to the boundary magnetic field. Contrary
to the phase transition on the Euclidean lattices, the discontinuous phase
transition on the hyperbolic lattices can be continuously controlled (within a
certain temperature coexistence region) by varying the boundary magnetic field.

characterized by assortative mixing. Real networks exhibit assortative mixing
by vertex degree, however typical random network models, such as Erdos-Renyi or
Barabasi-Albert, show no assortative arrangements. In this paper we introduce
the neighborhood assortativity notion, as the tendency of a node to belong to a

Imposing neighborhood assortative mixing by degree in a network toy model, SOC
dynamics can be found. The long-range correlations resulting from the
criticality have been characterized by means of fluctuation analysis and show
an anticorrelation in the node's activity. The model contains only one

collapsed into a single curve. The simplicity of the model allows performing
numerical simulations and also to study analytically the statistics for a

the evolution of a coined quantum walk on a generic graph using a

also arise as the infinitesimal generators of some substantial processes such
as the reflected spectrally negative $\alpha$-stable process. Our approach
relies on intertwining relations that we establish between these semigroups and
the semigroup of a Bessel type process whose generator is a self-adjoint second
order differential operator. In particular, from this commutation relation, we
characterize the positive real axis as the continuous point spectrum of $P$ and
provide a power series representation of the corresponding eigenfunctions. We
also identify the positive real axis as the residual spectrum of the adjoint
operator $\hatP$ and elucidates its role in the spectral decomposition of these
operators. By resorting to the concept of continuous frames, we proceed by
investigating the domain of the spectral operators and derive two
representations for the heat kernels of these semigroups. As a by-product, we
also obtain regularity properties for these latter and also for the solution of
the associated Cauchy problem.

typical length scales of 32 Mm in the solar photosphere. Unlike granulation,
the size of which is comparable to both the thickness of the radiative boundary
layer and local scale height of the plasma in the photosphere, supergranulation
does not reflect any obvious length scale of the solar convection zone. Early
suggestions that the depth of second helium ionization is important are not
supported by numerical simulations. Thus the origin of the solar
supergranulation remains largely a mystery. Moreover, observations of flows in
the photosphere using either Doppler imaging or correlation or feature tracking
show a monotonic decrease in power at scales larger than supergranulation. Both
local area and global spherical shell simulations of solar convection by
contrast show the opposite, a power law increase in horizontal flow amplitudes
to low wavenumber. Here we examine this disparity, and investigate how the
solar supergranulation may arise as a consequence of strong photospheric
driving and non-local heat transport by cool diving plumes. Using three
dimensional anelastic simulations with surface driving, we show that the
kinetic energy of largest convective scales in the upper layers of a stratified
domain reflects the depth of transition from strong buoyant driving to
adiabatic stratification below. We interpret the observed monotonic decrease in
solar convective power at scales larger than supergranulation to be a
consequence of this rapid transition, and show how the supergranular scale can
be understood as the largest buoyantly driven mode of convection in the Sun.

properties toward the optimum. Despite the strength of this algorithm, most of
the problems reaching optimal solutions are time-demanding or impossible. In
this paper, we modified single objective BFO by adding a mutation operator and
multi-objective BFO (MOBFO) by adding mutation and crossover from genetic
algorithm operators to update the solutions in each generation, and local tabu
search algorithm to reach the local optimum solution. Additionally, we used a
fast nondominated sort algorithm in MOBFO to find the best-nondominated

amplitude-modulated classical laser field in the dispersive (far-detuned)

amplification of the mechanical vacuum fluctuations of the MO, which results in
the generation of Casimir phonons over time scales longer than the cavity
lifetime. We show that the generated phonons exhibit quadrature squeezing,
bunching effect, and super-Poissonian statistics which are controllable by the
externally modulated laser pump. In particular, we find that the scheme allows
for a perfect squeezing transfer from one mechanical quadrature to another when
the laser frequency is varied from red detuning to blue detuning. Moreover, by
analyzing the effect of the thermal noise of the MO environment, we find that
there exists a critical temperature above which there is no phonon quadrature
squeezing to occur. We also show that in the presence of time modulation of the
driving laser the linewidth narrowing of the displacement spectrum of the MO
can be considered as a signature of the generation of Casimir phonons.

conjectures of Eskin and Zorich on the large genus limits of Masur-Veech
volumes and of Siegel-Veech constants.
  In Part I we connect the geometric definition of Siegel-Veech constants both
with a combinatorial counting problem and with intersection numbers on Hurwitz
spaces. We introduce modified Siegel-Veech weights whose generating functions
will later be shown to be quasimodular.
  Parts II and III are devoted to the study of the quasimodularity of the
generating functions arising from weighted counting of torus coverings. The
starting point is the theorem of Bloch and Okounkov saying that q-brackets of
shifted symmetric functions are quasimodular forms. In Part II we give an
expression for their growth polynomials in terms of Gaussian integrals and use
this to obtain a closed formula for the generating series of cumulants that is
the basis for studying large genus asymptotics. In Part III we show that the
even hook-length moments of partitions are shifted symmetric polynomials and
prove a formula for the q-bracket of the product of such a hook-length moment
with an arbitrary shifted symmetric polynomial. This formula proves
quasimodularity also for the (-2)-nd hook-length moments by extrapolation, and
implies the quasimodularity of the Siegel-Veech weighted counting functions.
  Finally, in Part IV these results are used to give explicit generating
functions for the volumes and Siegel-Veech constants in the case of the

the Eskin-Zorich conjectures we provide a general framework for computing the

especially primordial cosmology: i.e. the cosmological investigation of the
very early universe.
  We first (Section 2) state our allegiance to scientific realism, and discuss
what insights about it cosmology might yield, as against ""just"" supplying
scientific claims that philosophers can then evaluate. In particular, we
discuss: the idea of laws of cosmology, and limitations on ascertaining the
global structure of spacetime. Then we review some of what is now known about
the early universe (Section 3): meaning, roughly, from a thousandth of a second
after the Big Bang onwards(!).
  The rest of the paper takes up two issues about primordial cosmology, i.e.
the very early universe, where ""very early"" means, roughly, much earlier
(logarithmically) than one second after the Big Bang: say, less than $10^{-11}$
seconds. Both issues illustrate that familiar philosophical threat to
scientific realism, the under-determination of theory by data---on a cosmic
scale.
  The first issue (Section 4) concerns the difficulty of observationally
probing the very early universe. More specifically, the difficulty is to
ascertain details of the putative inflationary epoch. The second issue (Section
5) concerns difficulties about confirming a cosmological theory that postulates
a multiverse, i.e. a set of domains (universes) each of whose inhabitants (if
any) cannot directly observe, or otherwise causally interact with, other
domains. This again concerns inflation, since many inflationary models
postulate a multiverse.
  For all these issues, it will be clear that much remains unsettled, as
regards both physics and philosophy. But we will maintain that these remaining
controversies do not threaten scientific realism.

communication system are studied. First, a numerical analysis of the additive
white Gaussian noise (AWGN) channel investigates the effect of using a small
number of input probability mass functions (PMFs) for a range of
signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs), instead of optimizing the constellation shaping
for each SNR. It is shown that if a small penalty of at most 0.1 dB SNR to the
full shaping gain is acceptable, just two shaped PMFs are required per
quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM) over a large SNR range. For a multi-span
wavelength division multiplexing (WDM) optical fiber system with 64QAM input,
it is shown that just one PMF is required to achieve large gains over uniform
input for distances from 1,400 km to 3,000 km. Using recently developed
theoretical models that extend the Gaussian noise (GN) model and full-field
split-step simulations, we illustrate the ramifications of probabilistic
shaping on the effective SNR after fiber propagation. Our results show that,
for a fixed average optical launch power, a shaping gain is obtained for the
noise contributions from fiber amplifiers and modulation-independent nonlinear
interference (NLI), whereas shaping simultaneously causes a penalty as it leads
to an increased NLI. However, this nonlinear shaping loss is found to have a
relatively minor impact, and optimizing the shaped PMF with a
modulation-dependent GN model confirms that the PMF found for AWGN is also a
good choice for a multi-span fiber system.

properties of the cosmic background radiation (CMB) maps. Between their
notorious advantages is the possibility to use them efficiently in patches of
the CMB sphere, which allow studies in masked skies, inclusive analyses of
small sky regions. Then, possible deviations from Gaussianity are investigated
by comparison with MF obtained from a set of Gaussian isotropic simulated CMB
maps to which are applied the same cut-sky masks. These analyses are sensitive
enough to detect contaminations of small intensity like primary and secondary
CMB anisotropies. Our methodology uses the MF, widely employed to study
non-Gaussianities in CMB data, and asserts Gaussian deviations only when all of
them points out an exceptional $\chi^2$ value, at more than $2.2 \sigma$
confidence level, in a given sky patch. Following this rigorous procedure, we
find 13 regions in the foreground-cleaned Planck maps that evince such high
levels of non-Gaussian deviations. According to our results, these non-Gaussian
contributions show signatures that can be associated to the presence of hot or
cold spots in such regions. Moreover, some of these non-Gaussian deviations
signals suggest the presence of foreground residuals in those regions located
near the galactic plane. Additionally, we confirm that most of the regions
revealed in our analyses, but not all, have been recently reported in studies
done by the Planck collaboration. Furthermore, we also investigate whether
these non-Gaussian deviations can be possibly sourced by systematics, like
inhomogeneous noise and beam effect in the released Planck data, or perhaps due
to residual galactic foregrounds.

model from LHC Run-I and II data. The phenomenology of mUED is determined by
only two parameters namely, the compactification scale ($R^{-1}$) of the extra
dimension and cutoff scale ($\Lambda$) of the theory. The characteristic
feature of mUED is the occurrence of nearly degenerate mass spectrum for the
Kaluza-Klein (KK) particles and hence, soft leptons, soft jets at the collider
experiments. The degree of degeneracy of KK-mass spectrum crucially depends on
$\Lambda$. The strongest direct bound on $R^{-1}$ ($\sim $950 GeV for large
$\Lambda$) arises from a search for a pair of soft dimuons at the Large Hadron
Collider (LHC) experiment with 8 TeV center-of-mass energy and $20~{\rm

splitting within the first KK-level, the bounds from the dimuon channel is
rather weak. On the other hand, the discovery of 126 GeV Higgs boson demands
small $\Lambda$ to prevent the scalar potential form being unbounded from
below. We discuss LHC monojet searches as a probe of low $\Lambda$ region of

illustrate our method with a number of examples. Tensor surgery on the triangle
graph, which corresponds to the matrix multiplication tensor, leads to
nontrivial rank upper bounds for all odd cycle graphs, which correspond to the
tensors of iterated matrix multiplication. In the asymptotic setting we obtain
upper bounds in terms of the matrix multiplication exponent $\omega$ and the
rectangular matrix multiplication parameter $\alpha$. These bounds are optimal
if $\omega$ equals two. We also give examples that illustrate that tensor
surgery on general graphs might involve the absorption of virtual hyperedges

lattice. Here we report on the site-resolved observation of charge and spin
correlations in the two-dimensional (2D) Fermi-Hubbard model realized with
ultracold atoms. Antiferromagnetic spin correlations are maximal at
half-filling and weaken monotonically upon doping. Correlations between singly
charged sites are negative at large doping, revealing the Pauli and correlation
hole\textemdash a suppressed probability of finding two fermions near each
other. However, as the doping is reduced below a critical value, correlations
between such local magnetic moments become positive, signaling strong bunching
of doublons and holes. Excellent agreement with numerical linked-cluster
expansion (NLCE) and determinantal quantum Monte Carlo (DQMC) calculations is
found. Positive non-local moment correlations directly imply potential energy
fluctuations due to doublon-hole pairs, which should play an important role for
transport in the Fermi-Hubbard model.

Accepted for publication in A&A",,"10.1051/0004-6361/201628816",,"astro-ph.GA","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The determination of the age of the bulge has led to two contradictory
results. On the one side, the color-magnitude diagrams in different bulge
fields seem to indicate a uniformly old ($>$10 Gyr) population. On the other
side, individual ages derived from dwarfs observed through microlensing events
seem to indicate a large spread, from $\sim$ 2 to $\sim$ 13 Gyr. Because the
bulge is now recognised as being mainly a boxy peanut-shaped bar, it is
suggested that disk stars are one of its main constituents, and therefore also
stars with ages significantly younger than 10 Gyr. Other arguments as well
point to the fact that the bulge cannot be exclusively old, and in particular
cannot be a burst population, as it is usually expected if the bulge was the
fossil remnant of a merger phase in the early Galaxy. In the present study, we
show that given the range of metallicities observed in the bulge, a uniformly
old population would be reflected into a significant spread in color at the
turn-off which is not observed. Inversely, we demonstrate that the correlation
between age and metallicity expected to hold for the inner disk would conspire
to form a color-magnitude diagram with a remarkably small spread in color, thus
mimicking the color-magnitude diagram of a uniformly old population. If stars
younger than 10 Gyr are part of the bulge, as must be the case if the bulge has
been mainly formed through dynamical instabilities in the disk, then a very
small spread at the turn-off is expected, as seen in the observations.

have demonstrated the effectiveness of the integration of GPU-based systems in
high level trigger of different experiments. On the other hand the use of GPUs
in the low level trigger systems, characterized by stringent real-time
constraints, such as tight time budget and high throughput, poses several
challenges. In this paper we focus on the low level trigger in the CERN NA62

synchronous system. Our approach aimed at harvesting the GPU computing power to
build in real-time refined physics-related trigger primitives for the RICH
detector, as the the knowledge of Cerenkov rings parameters allows to build
stringent conditions for data selection at trigger level. Latencies of all
components of the trigger chain have been analyzed, pointing out that
networking is the most critical one. To keep the latency of data transfer task
under control, we devised NaNet, an FPGA-based PCIe Network Interface Card
(NIC) with GPUDirect capabilities. For the processing task, we developed
specific multiple ring trigger algorithms to leverage the parallel architecture
of GPUs and increase the processing throughput to keep up with the high event
rate. Results obtained during the first months of 2016 NA62 run are presented

and star-forming galaxies, leave their imprint on the gamma-ray sky as nearly
isotropic emission referred to as the Extragalactic Gamma-Ray Background (EGB).
While the brightest of these sources may be individually resolved, their
fainter counterparts contribute diffusely. In this work, we use a
recently-developed analysis method, called the Non-Poissonian Template Fit, on
up to 93 months of publicly-available data from the Fermi Large Area Telescope
to determine the properties of the point sources that comprise the EGB. This
analysis takes advantage of photon-count statistics to probe the aggregate
properties of these source populations below the sensitivity threshold of
published catalogs. We measure the source-count distributions and point-source
intensities, as a function of energy, from 2 GeV to 2 TeV. We find that the EGB
is dominated by point sources, likely blazars, in all seven energy sub-bins
considered. These results have implications for the interpretation of IceCube's
PeV neutrinos, which may originate from sources that contribute to the

simulation. The package supports many of the common forms used to describe
galaxy-halo models: the halo occupation distribution (HOD), the conditional
luminosity function (CLF), abundance matching, and alternatives to these models
that include effects such as environmental quenching or variable galaxy
assembly bias. Satellite galaxies can be modeled to live in subhalos, or to
follow custom number density profiles within their halos, including spatial
and/or velocity bias with respect to the dark matter profile. The package has
an optimized toolkit to make mock observations on a synthetic galaxy
population, including galaxy clustering, galaxy-galaxy lensing, galaxy group
identification, RSD multipoles, void statistics, pairwise velocities and
others, allowing direct comparison to observations. Halotools is
object-oriented, enabling complex models to be built from a set of simple,
interchangeable components, including those of your own creation. Halotools has
an automated testing suite and is exhaustively documented on
http://halotools.readthedocs.io, which includes quickstart guides, source code
notes and a large collection of tutorials. The documentation is effectively an
online textbook on how to build and study empirical models of galaxy formation

conformal symmetry of extremal black holes must be broken due to gravitational
backreaction at an IR scale linear in $G_N$. In this paper, we show that this
scale coincides with the so-called `thermodynamic mass gap' of near-extremal
black holes, a scale which signals the breakdown of their thermodynamic
description. We also develop a method which extends the analysis of Almheiri
and Polchinski to more complicated models with extremal throats by studying the
bulk linearized quantum field theory. Moreover, we show how their original
model correctly captures the universal physics of the near-horizon region of
near-extremal black holes at tree level, and conclude that this equivalence of
the conformal breaking and mass gap scale is general.

the chiral symmetry group as the usual chiral order parameter, and so for very
light quarks there may be two chiral phase transitions, which are both of first
order. In QCD, results from the lattice indicate that any transition from the
tetraquark condensate is a smooth crossover. In the plane of temperature and

circular polarization (CP) of the CMB, however, has not been precisely
explored. Current upper limit on the CP of the CMB is at a level of deltaV/TCMB
~10^{-4} and is limited on large scales. Some of the cosmologically important
sources which can induce a CP in the CMB include early universe symmetry
breaking, primordial magnetic field, galaxy clusters and Pop III stars (also
known as the First stars). Among these sources, Pop III stars are expected to
induce the strongest signal with levels strongly dependent on the frequency of
observation and on the number, Np, of the Pop III stars per halo.
Optimistically, a CP signal in the CMB due to the Pop III stars could be at a
level of deltaV/TCMB ~ 2x10^{-7} in scales of 1 degree at 10 GHz, which is much
smaller than the currently existing upper limits on the CP measurements.
Primary foregrounds in the cosmological CP detection will come from the

all-sky maps of the galactic CP in different frequencies. This work also points
out that the galactic CP levels are important below 50 GHz and is an important

galaxies, based on data compiled from the literature and an archive (median
aperture $\theta_{\rm med}$ = 220 pc). A typical $M_{\rm dense}$ of CNDs is
10$^{7-8}$ $M_\odot$, estimated from the luminosity of the dense gas tracer,
the HCN($1-0$) emission line. Because dense molecular gas is the site of star
formation, this correlation is virtually equivalent to the one between nuclear
star formation rate and $\dot{M}_{\rm BH}$ revealed previously. Moreover, the
$M_{\rm dense}-\dot{M}_{\rm BH}$ correlation was tighter for CND-scale gas than
for the gas on kpc or larger scales. This indicates that CNDs likely play an
important role in fueling black holes, whereas $>$kpc scale gas does not. To
demonstrate a possible approach for studying the CND-scale accretion process
with the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA), we used a mass
accretion model where angular momentum loss due to supernova explosions is
vital. Based on the model prediction, we suggest that only the partial fraction
of the mass accreted from the CND ($\dot{M}_{\rm acc}$) is consumed as
$\dot{M}_{\rm BH}$. However, $\dot{M}_{\rm acc}$ agrees well with the total
nuclear mass flow rate (i.e., $\dot{M}_{\rm BH}$ + outflow rate). Although
these results are still tentative with large uncertainties, they support the
view that star formation in CNDs can drive mass accretion onto supermassive
black holes in Seyfert galaxies.

placing cold atoms in optical cavities, and inducing strong coupling between

the composition of the supermode polariton is changed by the matter-light
coupling upon condensation. These results, found in the few-mode-degenerate

from heavy diphoton resonance ($X$) negative searches at the LHC, where $X$ is
identified with the neutral CP-even (odd) $H$ ($A$) or both (mass degenerate).
While minimal supersymmetric models (MSSM, etc) comply with the data, a leading
effective operator of $d=6$ can contribute significantly to diphoton production
$\sigma\sim 1$ fb, well above its MSSM value and in conflict with recent data.
Both the $b\bar b$ and $gg$ production mechanisms of $H$ and $A$ can contribute
comparably to this. We examine the dependence of the diphoton cross section
$\sigma$ on the values of $m_X$, $\Lambda$ and $\tan\beta$, under the
experimental constraints from the SM-like higgs couplings $hgg$ and
$h\gamma\gamma$ (due to mixing) and from the $b\bar b$ and $t\bar t$ searches.
These give $\Lambda$ larger than $\sim 5$ TeV for $m_X$ in the range $0.5-1$
TeV. We show how to generate the $d=6$ effective operator from microscopic
(renormalizable) models. This demands the presence of vector-like states beyond
the MSSM spectrum (and eventually but not necessarily a gauge singlet), of mass
near $\Lambda$ and thus outside the LHC reach.

auctions over bundles of goods, is one of the most fundamental problems in
computational economics, unsolved even for two bidders and two items for sale.
In the traditional economic models, it is assumed that the bidders' valuations
are drawn from an underlying distribution and that the auction designer has
perfect knowledge of this distribution. Despite this strong and oftentimes
unrealistic assumption, it is remarkable that the revenue-maximizing
combinatorial auction remains unknown. In recent years, automated mechanism
design has emerged as one of the most practical and promising approaches to
designing high-revenue combinatorial auctions. The most scalable automated
mechanism design algorithms take as input samples from the bidders' valuation
distribution and then search for a high-revenue auction in a rich auction
class. In this work, we provide the first sample complexity analysis for the
standard hierarchy of deterministic combinatorial auction classes used in
automated mechanism design. In particular, we provide tight sample complexity
bounds on the number of samples needed to guarantee that the empirical revenue
of the designed mechanism on the samples is close to its expected revenue on
the underlying, unknown distribution over bidder valuations, for each of the
auction classes in the hierarchy. In addition to helping set automated
mechanism design on firm foundations, our results also push the boundaries of
learning theory. In particular, the hypothesis functions used in our contexts

study higher order QCD effects. While the background and the signal can be
obtained at NNLO and NLO in QCD respectively, that is not the case for their
interference, which is currently known only at LO. In order to improve the
accuracy of the prediction for the interference term, we consider the effects
of extra QCD radiation, i.e. the $2 \to 3$ (loop-induced) processes and obtain
an estimate of the NLO corrections. As a result, we find that the contribution
of the interference is important both at the total cross-section level and,
most importantly, for the line-shape of the heavy scalar. In particular for
resonances with widths larger than a couple of percent of the resonance mass,
the interference term distorts the invariant mass distribution and generically
leads to a non-trivial peak-dip structure. We study this process in a
simplified model involving an additional scalar or pseudoscalar resonance as

hierarchy formation in social and economic entities, show signs of competition
and heterogeneous performance in the temporal evolution of their components,
which may eventually lead to stratified structures such as the wealth
distribution worldwide. However, it is still unclear whether the road to
hierarchical complexity is determined by the particularities of each phenomena,
or if there are universal mechanisms of stratification common to many systems.
Human sports and games, with their (varied but simplified) rules of competition
and measures of performance, serve as an ideal test bed to look for universal
features of hierarchy formation. With this goal in mind, we analyse here the
behaviour of players and team rankings over time for several sports and games.
Even though, for a given time, the distribution of performance ranks varies
across activities, we find statistical regularities in the dynamics of ranks.
Specifically the rank diversity, a measure of the number of elements occupying
a given rank over a length of time, has the same functional form in sports and
games as in languages, another system where competition is determined by the
use or disuse of grammatical structures. Our results support the notion that
hierarchical phenomena may be driven by the same underlying mechanisms of rank
formation, regardless of the nature of their components. Moreover, such
regularities can in principle be used to predict lifetimes of rank occupancy,
thus increasing our ability to forecast stratification in the presence of
competition.

accretion disc fed by a Roche-lobe overflowing A-type giant. Here we extend
their analysis presenting new spectroscopic data and studying the Balmer

emissions whose strength also vary in the long-term. In addition, Doppler maps
of the emission lines reveal sites of enhanced line emission in the 1st and 4th
velocity quadrants, the first one consistent with the position of one of the
bright zones detected by the light curve analysis. We find a difference between
Doppler maps at high and low stage of the long cycle; evidence that the
emission is optically thicker at high state in the stream-disc impact region,
possibly reflecting a larger mass transfer rate. We compare the system
parameters with a grid of synthetic binary evolutionary tracks and find the
best fitting model. The system is found to be semi-detached, in a conservative
Case-B mass transfer stage, with age 7.68E7 yr and mass transfer rate 1.6E-6

standard methods for estimating the masses of starless cores and protostellar

knowledge of the origin and evolution of self-gravitating cores and protostars,
are uncertain. In this model-based study, a grid of radiative transfer models
of starless cores and protostellar envelopes was computed and their total
fluxes and image intensities were fitted to derive the model masses. To
investigate intrinsic effects related to the physical objects, all
observational complications were explicitly ignored. Known true values of the
numerical models allow us to assess the qualities of the methods and fitting
models, as well as the effects of nonuniform temperatures, far-infrared opacity
slope, selected subsets of wavelengths, background subtraction, and angular
resolutions. The method of fitting image intensities gives more accurate masses
for more resolved objects than the method of fitting total fluxes. With the
latter, a fitting model that assumes optically thin emission gives much better
results than the one allowing substantial optical depths. Temperature excesses
within the objects above the mass-averaged values skew their spectral shapes
towards shorter wavelengths, leading to masses underestimated typically by
factors 2-5. With a fixed opacity slope deviating from the true value by a
factor of 1.2, derived masses are inaccurate within a factor of 2. The most
accurate masses of the models are estimated by fitting just two or three
longest-wavelength fluxes. Conventional algorithm of background subtraction is
a likely source of large systematic errors. The absolute values of masses of
the unresolved or poorly resolved objects in star-forming regions are uncertain
to within at least a factor of 2-3.

objectives. This is not always the case: we show how to jointly control

that mixes training examples, the Crossover Process (cp). One key point is that
the cp~is typically able to alter joint distributions without touching on
marginals, nor altering the sufficient statistic for the class. In other words,
it saves (and sometimes improves) generalization for supervised learning, but
can alter the relationship between covariates --- and therefore fool measures
of nonlinear independence and causal inference into misleading ad-hoc
conclusions. For example, a cp~can increase / decrease odds ratios, bring
fairness or break fairness, tamper with disparate impact, strengthen, weaken or
reverse causal directions, change observed statistical measures of dependence.
For each of these, we quantify changes brought by a cp, as well as its
statistical impact on generalization abilities via a new complexity measure
that we call the Rademacher cp~complexity. Experiments on a dozen readily
available domains validate the theory.

supported by the three-fold solar metallicity that was measured in Jupiter's

gravitational moments of Jupiter and Saturn, models for their interiors include
heavy elements, $Z$, in various proportions. However, their effect on the

coin using a balance scale was introduced in the sixth International Kolmogorov
Math Tournament. This paper offers a comprehensive overview of this new problem
by presenting it in the context of the traditional coin weighing puzzle and
then explaining what makes the new problem mathematically unique. Two weighing
strategies described previously are used to derive lower bounds for the optimal
number of admissible situations for given parameters. Additionally, a new
weighing procedure is described that can be adapted to provide a solution for a
broad spectrum of initial parameters by representing the number of counterfeit
coins as a linear combination of positive integers. In closing, we offer a new
form of the traditional counterfeit coin problem and provide a lower bound for
the number of weighings necessary to solve it.

assessed before its adoption in clinical practice. Clinical preventive care
often uses risk scores to screen asymptomatic population. The primary clinical
interest is to predict the risk of having an event by a pre-specified future
time $t_0$. Prospective accuracy measures such as positive predictive values
have been recommended for evaluating the predictive performance. However, for
commonly used continuous or ordinal risk score systems, these measures require
a subjective cutoff threshold value that dichotomizes the risk scores. The need
for a cut-off value created barriers for practitioners and researchers. In this
paper, we propose a threshold-free summary index of positive predictive values
that accommodates time-dependent event status. We develop a nonparametric
estimator and provide an inference procedure for comparing this summary measure
between competing risk scores for censored time to event data. We conduct a
simulation study to examine the finite-sample performance of the proposed
estimation and inference procedures. Lastly, we illustrate the use of this
measure on a real data example, comparing two risk score systems for predicting
heart failure in childhood cancer survivors.

important yet challenging task, as these attacks are often erratic and
difficult to predict. Secure estimation problems study how to estimate the
states of a dynamical system from a set of noisy and maliciously corrupted
sensor measurements. The fewer assumptions that an estimator makes about the
attacker, the larger the set of attacks it can protect the system against. In
this paper, we focus on sensor attacks on UAVs and attempt to design a secure
estimator for linear time-invariant systems based on as few assumptions about
the attackers as possible. We propose a computationally efficient estimator
that protects the system against arbitrary and unbounded attacks, where the set
of attacked sensors can also change over time. In addition, we propose to
combine our secure estimator with a Kalman Filter for improved practical
performance and demonstrate its effectiveness through simulations of two
scenarios where an UAV is under adversarial cyber attack.

optical absorption spectra and spatial distribution of bright excitons in the
visible region for a prototypical DSSC, catechol on rutile TiO$_2$(110), as a
function of coverage and deprotonation of the OH anchoring groups. This is
accomplished by solving the Bethe-Salpeter equation (BSE) based on hybrid

the interfacial level alignment and the weakly bound charge transfer
transitions that are the dominant absorption mechanism in type-II DSSCs. Our
HSE06 BSE spectra agree semi-quantitatively with spectra measured for catechol
on anatase TiO$_2$ nanoparticles. Our results suggest deprotonation of
catechol's OH anchoring groups, while being nearly isoenergetic at high
coverages, shifts the onset of the absorption spectra to lower energies, with a
concomitant increase in photovoltaic efficiency. Further, the most relevant
bright excitons in the visible region are rather intense charge transfer
transitions with the electron and hole spatially separated in both the [110]

the Milankovitch vector formulation of perturbation theory, which governs the
long-term orbital evolution subject to the predominant gravitational
interactions. We study the global dynamics of this two-and-a-half

Emphasis is placed upon the phase-space structures near secular resonances,
which are of first importance to the space debris community. We confirm and
quantify the transition from order to chaos in MEO, stemming from the critical
inclinations, and find that highly inclined GEO orbits are particularly
unstable. Despite their reputed normality, Earth satellite orbits can possess
an extraordinarily rich spectrum of dynamical behaviors, and, from a
mathematical perspective, have all the complications that make them very
interesting candidates for testing the modern tools of chaos theory.

due to O-X mode conversion is maximum. That direction, and the angular map of
reflectivity around it, contain information on the magnetic field vector B at
the cutoff layer. Probing the plasma with different wave frequencies provides
the radial profile of B. Full-wave finite-element simulations are presented
here in 2D slab geometry. Modeling confirms the existence of a minimum in
reflectivity that depends on the magnetic field at the cutoff, as expected from
mode conversion physics, giving confidence in the feasibility of the
diagnostic. The proposed reflectometric approach is expected to yield superior
signal-to-noise ratio and to access wider ranges of density and magnetic field,
compared with related radiometric techniques that require the plasma to emit
Electron Bernstein Waves. Due to computational limitations, frequencies of
10-20 GHz were considered in this initial study. Frequencies above the edge
electron-cyclotron frequency (f>28 GHz here) would be preferable for the

quasi-stationary modes with rotating precursors (not including born locked
modes). A parameter formulated by the plasma internal inductance $l_i$ divided
by the safety factor at 95% of the poloidal flux, $q_{95}$, is found to exhibit
predictive capability over whether a locked mode will cause a disruption or
not, and does so up to hundreds of milliseconds before the disruption. Within
20 ms of the disruption, the shortest distance between the island separatrix
and the unperturbed last closed flux surface, referred to as $d_{edge}$,
performs comparably to $l_i/q_{95}$ in its ability to discriminate disruptive
locked modes. Out of all parameters considered, $d_{edge}$ also correlates best
with the duration of the locked mode. Within 50 ms of a locked mode disruption,
average behavior includes exponential growth of the $n=1$ perturbed field,
which might be due to the 2/1 locked mode. Even assuming the aforementioned 2/1
growth, disruptivity following a locked mode shows little dependence on island
width up to 20 ms before the disruption. Separately, greater deceleration of
the rotating precursor is observed when the wall torque is large. At locking,
modes are often observed to align with a residual error field. Timescales
associated with the mode evolution are also studied and dictate the response

The condensate at $q>1$ is smaller than that at $q=1$. The sigma mass at $q>1$

the huge amount of user-generated social media contents propagating between

the limited bandwidth and storage capacities. Motivated by device-to-device

device-to-device manner. Based on large-scale measurement studies on social
content propagation and user mobility patterns in edge-network regions, we
observe that (1) Device-to-device replication can significantly help users
download social contents from nearby neighboring peers; (2) Both social

The replication strategies depend on regional characteristics ({\em e.g.}, how
users move across regions).
  Using these measurement insights, we propose a joint \emph{propagation- and

social contents are assigned to users in edge-network regions according to a
joint consideration of social graph, content propagation and user mobility. We
formulate the replication scheduling as an optimization problem and design
distributed algorithm only using historical, local and partial information to
solve it. Trace-driven experiments further verify the superiority of our

base stations (BSs) as well as the CRAN remote radio heads seek to choose their
optimal power to maximize their users' rates. The problem is formulated as a
noncooperative game in which the players are the CRAN's cloud and the BSs.
Given the difference of capabilities between the CRAN and the various BSs, the
game is cast within the framework of cognitive hierarchy theory. In this
framework, players are organized in a hierarchy in such a way that a player can
choose its strategy while considering players of only similar or lower
hierarchies. Using such a hierarchical design, one can reduce the interference
caused by the CRAN and high-powered base stations on low-powered BSs. For this
game, the properties of the Nash equilibrium and the cognitive hierarchy
equilibrium are analyzed. Simulation results show that the proposed cognitive
hierarchy model yields significant performance gains, in terms of the total
rate, reaching up to twice the rate achieved by a classical noncooperative
game's Nash equilibrium.

the severe capacity crunch in modern content centric wireless networks by
leveraging network load-balancing in the form of localized content storage and
delivery. In this work, we consider a cache-aided network where the cache
storage phase is assisted by a central server and users can demand multiple
files at each transmission interval. To service these demands, we consider two
delivery models - $(1)$ centralized content delivery where user demands at each
transmission interval are serviced by the central server via multicast
transmissions; and $(2)$ device-to-device (D2D) assisted distributed delivery
where users multicast to each other in order to service file demands. For such
cache-aided networks, we present new results on the fundamental cache storage
vs. transmission rate tradeoff. Specifically, we develop a new technique for
characterizing information theoretic lower bounds on the storage-rate tradeoff
and show that the new lower bounds are strictly tighter than cut-set bounds
from literature. Furthermore, using the new lower bounds, we establish the
optimal storage-rate tradeoff to within a constant multiplicative gap. We show
that, for multiple demands per user, achievable schemes based on repetition of
schemes for single demands are order-optimal under both delivery models.

particular, the sensor network is defined by an undirected graph, where each
sensor can observe samples over time, access the information from the adjacent
sensors, and perform the sequential test based on its own decision statistic.
Different from most literature, the sampling process and the information
exchange process in our framework take place simultaneously (or, at least in
comparable time-scales), thus cannot be decoupled from one another. Two
message-passing schemes are considered, based on which the distributed
sequential probability ratio test (DSPRT) is carried out respectively. The
first scheme features the dissemination of the raw samples. Although the sample
propagation based DSPRT is shown to yield the asymptotically optimal
performance at each sensor, it incurs excessive inter-sensor communication
overhead due to the exchange of raw samples with index information. The second
scheme adopts the consensus algorithm, where the local decision statistic is
exchanged between sensors instead of the raw samples, thus significantly
lowering the communication requirement compared to the first scheme. In
particular, the decision statistic for DSPRT at each sensor is updated by the
weighted average of the decision statistics in the neighbourhood at every
message-passing step. We show that, under certain regularity conditions, the
consensus algorithm based DSPRT also yields the order-2 asymptotically optimal
performance at all sensors.

the Jaynes-Cummings type. Previous work has shown that ringing up the resonator
approximately respects this ladder structure to produce a coherent state in the
eigenbasis (a dressed coherent state). We numerically investigate the validity
of this coherent state approximation to find two primary deviations. First,
resonator ring-up leaks small stray populations into eigenstate ladders
corresponding to different transmon states. Second, within an eigenstate ladder
the transmon nonlinearity shears the coherent state as it evolves. We then show
that the next natural approximation for this sheared state in the eigenbasis is
a dressed squeezed state, and derive simple evolution equations for such states

inter-session network coding (INC) can significantly increase the throughput.
However, the corresponding scheduling solution (when assuming dynamic arrivals
instead and requiring bounded delay) is still nascent. For the 2-flow downlink
scenario, we propose the first opportunistic INC + scheduling solution that is
provably optimal for time-varying channels, i.e., the corresponding stability
region matches the optimal Shannon capacity. Specifically, we first introduce a
new binary INC operation, which is distinctly different from the traditional
wisdom of XORing two overheard packets. We then develop a queue-length-based
scheduling scheme and prove that it, with the help of the new INC operation,
achieves the optimal stability region with time-varying channel quality. The
proposed algorithm is later generalized to include the capability of rate
adaptation. Simulation results show that it again achieves the optimal
throughput with rate adaptation. A byproduct of our results is a scheduling
scheme for stochastic processing networks (SPNs) with random departure, which
relaxes the of deterministic departure in the existing results.

i.e., our DFT calculation without including the SOC predicts that the T$_4$
structure is energetically favored over the H$_3$ structure by ${\Delta}E$ = 25
meV for Pb/Si(111) and 22 meV for Pb/Ge(111), but the inclusion of SOC reverses
their relative stability as ${\Delta}E$ = $-$12 and $-$7 meV, respectively. Our
analysis shows that the SOC-induced switching of the ground state is attributed
to a more asymmetric surface charge distribution in the H$_3$ structure, which
gives rise to a relatively larger Rashba spin splitting of surface states as
well as a relatively larger pseudo-gap opening compared to the T$_4$ structure.
By the nudged elastic band calculation, we obtain a sizable energy barrier from
the H$_3$ to the T$_4$ structure as ${\sim}$0.59 and ${\sim}$0.27 eV for

Wallace","Active Discriminative Text Representation Learning","This paper got accepted by AAAI 2017",,,,"cs.CL","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We propose a new active learning (AL) method for text classification with
convolutional neural networks (CNNs). In AL, one selects the instances to be
manually labeled with the aim of maximizing model performance with minimal
effort. Neural models capitalize on word embeddings as representations
(features), tuning these to the task at hand. We argue that AL strategies for
multi-layered neural models should focus on selecting instances that most
affect the embedding space (i.e., induce discriminative word representations).
This is in contrast to traditional AL approaches (e.g., entropy-based
uncertainty sampling), which specify higher level objectives. We propose a
simple approach for sentence classification that selects instances containing
words whose embeddings are likely to be updated with the greatest magnitude,
thereby rapidly learning discriminative, task-specific embeddings. We extend
this approach to document classification by jointly considering: (1) the
expected changes to the constituent word representations; and (2) the model's
current overall uncertainty regarding the instance. The relative emphasis
placed on these criteria is governed by a stochastic process that favors
selecting instances likely to improve representations at the outset of
learning, and then shifts toward general uncertainty sampling as AL progresses.
Empirical results show that our method outperforms baseline AL approaches on
both sentence and document classification tasks. We also show that, as
expected, the method quickly learns discriminative word embeddings. To the best
of our knowledge, this is the first work on AL addressing neural models for
text classification.

from the quark and anti-quark elementary fragmentation functions for emitting
specific mesons in the NJL model under the requirement that the $q\bar q$ pair
maintains in the flavor-singlet state after meson emissions. An integral
equation, which iterates the gluon elementary fragmentation functions to all

scale. It is observed that these solutions are stable with respect to variation
of relevant model parameters, especially after QCD evolution to a higher scale
is implemented. We show that the inclusion of the gluon fragmentation functions

non-relativistic nuclear energy-density functional (EDF) encodes effects of
three-nucleon forces and dynamical correlations. The necessity for a coupling
coefficient in the form of a small fractional power of rho is empirical and the
power often chosen arbitrarily. Consequently, precision-oriented
parameterisations risk overfitting and loss of predictive power.
  Observing that the Fermi momentum kF~rho^1/3 is a key variable in Fermi
systems, we examine if a power hierarchy in kF can be inferred from the
properties of homogeneous matter in a domain of densities which is relevant for
nuclear structure and neutron stars. For later applications we want to
determine an EDF that is of good quality but not overtrained. We fit polynomial
and other functions of rho^1/3 to existing microscopic calculations of the
energy of symmetric and pure neutron matter and analyze the fits. We select a
form and parameter set which we found robust and examine the parameters'
naturalness and the resulting extrapolations. A statistical analysis confirms
that low-order terms like rho^1/3 and rho^2/3 are the most relevant ones. It
also hints at a different power hierarchy for symmetric vs. pure neutron
matter, supporting the need for more than one rho^a terms in non-relativistic
EDFs. The EDF we propose accommodates adopted properties of nuclear matter near
saturation. Importantly, its extrapolation to dilute or asymmetric matter
reproduces a range of existing microscopic results, to which it has not been
fitted. It also predicts neutron-star properties consistent with observations.
The coefficients display naturalness.
  Once determined for homogeneous matter, EDFs of the present form can be
mapped onto Skyrme-type ones for use in nuclei. The statistical analysis can be
extended to higher orders and for different ab initio calculations.

deep convolutional neural networks (DCNNs), require vast amounts of training
data to achieve state-of-the-art performance. Decreasing this data requirement
would significantly speed up the training process and possibly improve
generalization. Motivated by this objective, we consider the task of adaptively
finding concise training subsets which will be iteratively presented to the
learner. We use convex optimization methods, based on an objective criterion
and feedback from the current performance of the classifier, to efficiently
identify informative samples to train on. We propose an algorithm to decompose
the optimization problem into smaller per-class problems, which can be solved
in parallel. We test our approach on standard classification tasks and
demonstrate its effectiveness in decreasing the training set size without

the strategic phase associated to the planning of the flight trajectories and
the tactical modifications occurring in the en-route phase. An implementation
of the model is available as open-source and freely accessible by any user.
  More specifically, different procedures related to business trajectories and
free-routing are tested and we illustrate the capabilities of the model on
airspace implementing these concepts. After performing numerical simulations
with the model, we show that in a free-routing scenario the controllers perform
less operations although they are dispersed over a larger portion of the
airspace. This can potentially increase the complexity of conflict detection
and resolution for controllers.
  In order to investigate this specific aspect, we consider some metrics used
to measure traffic complexity. We first show that in non-free-routing
situations our simulator deals with complexity in a way similar to what humans
would do. This allows us to be confident that the results of our numerical
simulations relative to the free-routing can reasonably forecast how human
controllers would behave in this new situation. Specifically, our numerical
simulations show that most of the complexity metrics decrease with
free-routing, while the few metrics which increase are all linked to the flight
level changes. This is a non-trivial result since intuitively the complexity
should increase with free-routing because of problematic geometries and more
dispersed conflicts over the airspace.

(1) counter-rotation between different galaxy components and (2) the formation
of ring galaxies. We suggest that these are direct consequences of the galaxy
being acted upon by a torque which causes a change in its primordial spin
angular momentum first observed as changes in the gas kinematics or
distribution. We suggest that this torque is exerted by the gravitational force
between nearby galaxies. This origin requires the presence of at least one
companion galaxy in the vicinity - we find a companion galaxy within 750 kpc
for 51/57 counter-rotating galaxies and literature indicates that all ring
galaxies have a companion galaxy thus giving observable credence to this
origin. Moreover in these 51 galaxies, we find a kinematic offset between
stellar and gas heliocentric velocities $>50$ kms$^{-1}$ for several galaxies
if the separation between the galaxies $<$ 100 kpc. This, we suggest, indicates
a change in the orbital angular momentum of the torqued galaxies. A major
difference between the torque origin suggested here and the existing model of
gas accretion/galaxy collision, generally used to explain the above two
phenomena, is that the torque acts on the matter of the same galaxy whereas in
the latter case gas, with different properties, is brought in from outside. An
important implication of our study is that mutual gravity torques acting on the
galaxy can explain the formation of warps, polar ring galaxies and lenticular
galaxies. We conclude that mutual gravity torques play an important role in the
dynamical evolution of galaxies and that they naturally explain several galaxy
observables.

that are solutions of General Relativity minimally coupled to a massive,
complex scalar field: Kerr BHs with scalar hair (KBHsSH). Such BHs bifurcate
from the vacuum Kerr solution and can be regarded as a horizon within a
rotating boson star. In a recent letter, it was shown that KBHsSH can exhibit
very distinct shadows from the ones of their vacuum counterparts. The setup
therein, however, considered the light source to be a celestial sphere
sufficiently far away from the BH. Here, we analyse KBHsSH surrounded by an
emitting torus of matter, simulating a more realistic astrophysical
environment, and study the corresponding lensing of light as seen by a very far
away observer, to appropriately model ground-based observations of Sgr A*. We
find that the differences in imaging between KBHsSH and comparable vacuum Kerr
BHs remain, albeit less dramatic than those observed for the corresponding
shadows in the previous setup. In particular, we highlight two observables that
might allow differentiating KBHsSH and Kerr BHs. The first is the angular size
of the photon ring (in a Kerr spacetime) or lensing ring (in a KBHSH
spacetime), the latter being significantly smaller for sufficiently
non-Kerr-like spacetimes. The second is the existence of an edge in the
intensity distribution (the photon ring in Kerr spacetime). This edge can
disappear for very non-Kerr-like KBHsSH. It is plausible, therefore, that
sufficiently precise Very Long Baseline Interferometric observations of BH
candidates can constrain this model.

can be chosen independently. In the prototype ilmenite and corundum structures
one third of the octahedra are vacant. The reported structure is obtained by
filling vacant (x>0) or emptying filled (x<0) octahedra. When x = 1 all
octahedra are filled. Two factors controlling the magnetism and crystal
distortion are identified. First is a direct overlap between the adjacent
cation d-orbitals resulting in a bond formation and magnetic interactions
between the cations. This is most clearly revealed as a crystal distortion in
the x approximately 0 compositions with approximately equal amounts of Ni and
Co: the distortion of the x approximately 0 compound is a function of Ni/Co
ratio. The second factor is x, which controls the cation shift towards a vacant
octahedron. The displacement decreases and the symmetry increases with
decreasing Ti content as was revealed by x-ray diffraction and Raman
spectroscopy. When all octahedra are filled the cations prefer octahedron
center positions. Also the number density of cations has increased by a factor
of 50 percent when compared to the ilmenite structure. The number density
ratios of Ni/Co cations between x=1 and x=0 compounds is 3. The Raman and x-ray

that exhibit gradients of orientations from Kurdjumov-Sachs (KS) to
Nishiyama-Wassermann (NW). They are structured into four packets on each of the
common close-packed plane {111}fcc// {110}bcc; and each packet is composed of
three blocks constituted by pairs of low-misoriented variants. The habit planes
reported in literature for this type of martensite are {557}fcc, but it is not
clear whether they correspond to the laths or to the blocks. In this paper, we
present crystallographic calculations proving that the average of the two KS
distortions associated with the variants in a block is exactly a NW distortion.
A new method of averaging distortion matrices was introduced for this purpose.
It is also shown that the {575}fcc planes are let untilted by this NW
distortion, and are thus good theoretical candidates for the observed habit
planes. The predicted {575}fcc planes, however, do not contain any of the
common close-packed directions of the two variants in the block, which is in
apparent contradiction with the current view. In order to clarify this point,
some Electron BackScatter Diffraction (EBSD) maps were acquired on different
low-carbon steels; the prior austenitic grains were automatically reconstructed
and the traces of the habit planes predicted by the different models were
analyzed and compared to the morphologies. This experimental work shows that
{575}fcc planes are the habit plane of the blocks, and that the habit plane of
one block often dominates the others, which impedes to discriminate the
different models. The advantages of our model are its simplicity, the absence
of fitting parameters, and the symmetric role played by the variants the
blocks.

the inductances can be varied by applying a magnetic field. Still, we find that

of quantum gravity is analysed, whereas in the second we deal with the
high-energy domain. In the first part, by applying the effective field theory
point of view to the quantization of general relativity, detectable, though
tiny, quantum effects in the position of Newtonian Lagrangian points of the
Earth-Moon system are found. In order to make more realistic the quantum
corrected model proposed, the full three-body problem where the Earth and the
Moon interact with a generic massive body and the restricted four-body problem
involving the perturbative effects produced by the gravitational presence of
the Sun in the Earth-Moon system are also studied. After that, a new quantum
theory having general relativity as its classical counterpart is analysed. By
exploiting this framework, an innovative interesting prediction involving the
position of Lagrangian points within the context of general relativity is
described. Furthermore, the new pattern provides quantum corrections to the
relativistic coordinates of Earth-Moon libration points of the order of few
millimetres. The second part of the thesis deals with the Riemannian curvature
characterizing the boosted form assumed by the Schwarzschild-de Sitter metric.
The analysis of the Kretschmann invariant and the geodesic equation shows that
the spacetime possesses a ""scalar curvature singularity"" within a 3-sphere and
that it is possible to define what we here call ""boosted horizon"", a sort of
elastic wall where all particles are surprisingly pushed away, suggesting that
such ""boosted geometries"" are ruled by a sort of ""antigravity effect"".
Eventually, the equivalence with the coordinate shift method is invoked in
order to demonstrate that all $\delta^2$ terms appearing in the Riemann
curvature tensor give vanishing contribution in distributional sense.

profiles of density and temperature in the Scrape Off Layer (SOL) with the
fluctuations (filaments) that generate them. The framework is based on the
dynamics of independent filaments and on their statistical behaviour and can be
used to rigorously understand the mechanisms that lead to the non-exponential
nature of the radial SOL profiles as well as the increase of the relative
fluctuation amplitude in the far SOL. Several models for the dynamics of the
filaments, which can be applied to the framework, are derived and discussed for
the purpose of identifying how different assumptions lead to the emergence of
features in the profiles. It is found that multiple alternative models can
explain the observations, thus motivating more stringent and focused
experimental analysis. In particular, radially accelerating filaments, less
efficient parallel exhaust and also a statistical distribution of the velocity
of the filaments can all contribute to induce flatter profiles in the far SOL.
A quite general result is the resiliency of the non-exponential nature of the
profiles. At the same time, several of the models discussed can also capture
the increase of the relative fluctuation amplitude observed in the far SOL. It
is also shown that several scenarios are compatible with the broadening of the
SOL, which could be caused by charge exchange interactions with neutral
particles or by a significant radial acceleration of the filaments.

Here, using X-ray magnetic circular dichroism (XMCD), which is extremely
sensitive to the local magnetic state of each atom, we investigate the magnetic
properties of the nanoparticles and the matrix in GeMn separately. We find that
the MR ratio is proportional to the product of the magnetizations originating
from the nanoparticles and the matrix. This result indicates that
spin-polarized holes in the nanoparticles penetrate into the matrix and that
these holes undergo spin-disorder magnetic scattering by the paramagnetic Mn

  Meeting on General Relativity",,,,"astro-ph.HE","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) are cosmological explosions which carry valuable
information from the distant past of the expanding universe. One of the
greatest discoveries in modern cosmology is the finding of the accelerated
expansion of the universe using Type Ia supernovae (SN Ia) as standard candles.
However, due to the interstellar extinction SN Ia can be seen only up to a
redshift $z\sim 1.5$. GRBs are considered as the potential alternative to push
this limit to as high as $z\sim 10$, a redshift regime corresponding to an
epoch when the universe just started to form the first structures. There exist
several correlations between the energy and an observable of a GRB which can be
used to derive luminosity distance. In recent works, we have studied spectral
evolution within the individual pulses and obtained such correlations within
the pulses. Here we summarize our results of the pulse-wise GRB correlation
study. It is worth mentioning that all GRB correlations are still empirical,
and we cannot use them in cosmology unless we understand the basic physics of
GRBs. To this end, we need to investigate the prompt emission spectrum which is
so far generally described by the empirical Band function. We shall discuss our
current understanding of the radiation process particularly the finding of two
blackbodies and a powerlaw (the 2BBPL model) as the generic spectral model and
its implication. This is a work in progress and we expect to obtain the most
fundamental GRB correlation based on our improved spectral model.

computationally expensive models are used, as it is the case in most
applications in engineering and applied sciences. In this respect metamodels
such as polynomial chaos expansions (PCE) and Gaussian processes (GP) have
received tremendous attention in the last few years, as they allow one to
replace the original, taxing model by a surrogate which is built from an
experimental design of limited size. Then the surrogate can be used to compute
the sensitivity indices in negligible time. In this chapter an introduction to
each technique is given, with an emphasis on their strengths and limitations in
the context of global sensitivity analysis. In particular, Sobol' (resp. total
Sobol') indices can be computed analytically from the PCE coefficients. In
contrast, confidence intervals on sensitivity indices can be derived
straightforwardly from the properties of GPs. The performance of the two

CO(12-11), [CI] 609 and 370 micron, and [NII] 205 micron are clearly detected.
With an aim of investigating the physical conditions and excitation processes
of molecular gas, we first construct CO spectral line energy distributions
(SLEDs) on 10 pc scales by combining the FTS CO transitions with ground-based
low-J CO data and analyze the observed CO SLEDs using non-LTE radiative
transfer models. We find that the CO-traced molecular gas in N159W is warm
(kinetic temperature of 153-754 K) and moderately dense (H2 number density of
(1.1-4.5)e3 cm-3). To assess the impact of the energetic processes in the
interstellar medium on the physical conditions of the CO-emitting gas, we then
compare the observed CO line intensities with the models of photodissociation
regions (PDRs) and shocks. We first constrain the properties of PDRs by
modelling Herschel observations of [OI] 145, [CII] 158, and [CI] 370 micron
fine-structure lines and find that the constrained PDR components emit very
weak CO emission. X-rays and cosmic-rays are also found to provide a negligible
contribution to the CO emission, essentially ruling out ionizing sources
(ultraviolet photons, X-rays, and cosmic-rays) as the dominant heating source
for CO in N159W. On the other hand, mechanical heating by low-velocity C-type
shocks with ~10 km/s appears sufficient enough to reproduce the observed warm
CO.

opposite centrosomes, the interaction of kinetochores with MTs, and the
interaction of MTs with the chromosomes arms. We study the mechanical behavior

formation in terms of parameters characterizing the strength of motor sliding,
repulsive forces generated by polymerizing MTs, and the forces arising out of
interaction of MTs with kinetochores. The stability diagram helps in
quantifying the relative effects of the different interactions and elucidates
the role of motor proteins in formation and inhibition of spindle structures

certain parameter range, wherein the spindle structure can be stable for two
different finite separation distances between centrosomes. This occurrence of
bistability also suggests mechanical versatility of such self-assembled spindle

n-qubits, and a qubit with a qudit. Negative eigenvalues, obtained by
partial-transpose (PT) plus local unitary transformations (PTU) for one qubit
from the whole system, are used for indicating inseparability. A sufficient
criterion for full separability of the n-qubits and qubit-qudit systems is
given. We use the singular value decomposition (SVD) for improving the
criterion for full separability. General properties of entanglement and
separability are analyzed for a system of a qubit and a qudit and n-qubits
systems, with emphasis on maximally disordered subsystems (MDS) (i.e., density
matrices rho(MDS) for which tracing over any subsystem gives the unit density
matrix). A sufficient condition that rho(MDS) is not separable is that it has
an eigenvalue larger than 1/d for a qubit and a qudit, and larger than
1/2^(n-1) for n-qubits system. The PTU transformation does not change the
eigenvalues of the n-qubits MDS density matrices for odd n. Thus the
Peres-Horodecki criterion does not give any information about entanglement of
these density matrices, but this criterion is useful for indicating
inseparability for even n. The changes of the entanglement and separability
properties of the GHZ state, the Braid entangled state and the W state by
mixing them with white noise are analyzed by the use of the present methods.
The entanglement and separability properties of the GHZ-diagonal density

p(i), is analyzed as function of these probabilities. In some cases we show
that the Peres-Horodecki criterion is both sufficient and necessary.

generator $\varphi = 8^{\circ}$. Five values of the
wall-to-recovery-temperature ratio ($T_w/T_r$) are considered, corresponding to
cold, adiabatic and hot wall thermal conditions. We show that the main effect
of cooling is to decrease the characteristic scales of the interaction in terms
of upstream influence and extent of the separation bubble. The opposite
behavior is observed in the case of heating, that produces a marked dilatation
of the interaction region. The distribution of the Stanton number shows that a
strong amplification of the heat transfer occurs across the interaction, and
the maximum values of thermal and dynamic loads are found in the case of cold
wall. The analysis reveals that the fluctuating heat flux exhibits a strong
intermittent behavior, characterized by scattered spots with extremely high
values compared to the mean. Furthermore, the analogy between momentum and heat
transfer, typical of compressible, wall-bounded, equilibrium turbulent flows
does not apply for most part of the interaction domain. The pre-multiplied
spectra of the wall heat flux do not show any evidence of the influence of the
low-frequency shock motion, and the primary mechanism for the generation of
peak heating is found to be linked with the turbulence amplification in the

exponentially in the number of qubits consisted in the ancilla. Although the
probability can be amplified through the amplitude amplification process, the
input dependence of the amplitude amplification makes difficult to sequentially
combine two or more ancilla based circuits. A new version of the amplitude
amplification known as the oblivious amplitude amplification runs independently
of the input to the system register. This allow us to to sequentially combine
two or more ancilla based circuits. However, this type of the amplification
only works when the considered system is unitary or non-unitary but somehow
close to a unitary.
  In this paper, we present a general framework to simulate non-unitary
matrices on ancilla based quantum circuits in which the success probability is
maximized by using the oblivious amplitude amplification. In particular, we
show how to extend a non-unitary matrix to an almost unitary matrix. We then
simulate the extended matrix by using an ancilla based circuit design along
with the oblivious amplitude amplification. Measuring the distance of the
produced matrix to the closest unitary unitary matrix, a lower bound for the
fidelity of the final state obtained from the oblivious amplitude amplification
process is presented. Numerical simulations for random matrices of different
sizes show that independent of the system size, the final amplified
probabilities are generally around 0.75 and the fidelity of the final state is
mostly high and around 0.95. Furthermore, we discuss the complexity analysis
and show that combining two such ancilla based circuits, a matrix product can
be implemented. This may lead us to efficiently implement matrix functions
represented as infinite matrix products on quantum computers.

validity of a ray-tracing inversion technique developed to derive the dust
temperature and density structure of isolated starless cores directly from the
dust emission maps and to test if the resulting temperature and density
profiles are consistent with physical models. Using this ray-tracing inversion
technique, we derive the dust temperature and density structure of six isolated
starless cloud cores. We employ self-consistent radiative transfer modeling to
the derived density profiles, treating the ISRF as the only heating source. The
best-fit values of local strength of the ISRF and the extinction by the outer
envelope are derived by comparing the self-consistently calculated temperature
profiles with those derived by the ray-tracing method. We find that all
starless cores are significantly colder inside than outside, with the core
temperatures showing a strong negative correlation with peak column density.
This suggests that their thermal structure is dominated by external heating
from the ISRF and shielding by dusty envelopes. The temperature profiles

measure the mass in the inner region of galaxies or galaxy clusters. In
particular, the mass within one Einstein radius can be determined with an
accuracy of order of a few percent or better, depending on the image
configuration. For other radii, however, degeneracies exist between galaxy
density profiles, precluding an accurate determination of the enclosed mass.
The source position transformation (SPT), which includes the well-known
mass-sheet transformation (MST) as a special case, describes this degeneracy of
the lensing observables in a more general way. In this paper we explore
properties of an SPT, removing the MST to leading order, i.e., we consider
degeneracies which have not been described before. The deflection field
$\boldsymbol{\hat{\alpha}}(\boldsymbol{\theta})$ resulting from an SPT is not
curl-free in general, and thus not a deflection that can be obtained from a
lensing mass distribution. Starting from a variational principle, we construct
lensing potentials that give rise to a deflection field
$\boldsymbol{\tilde{\alpha}}$, which differs from $\boldsymbol{\hat{\alpha}}$
by less than an observationally motivated upper limit. The corresponding mass
distributions from these 'valid' SPTs are studied: their radial profiles are
modified relative to the original mass distribution in a significant and
non-trivial way, and originally axi-symmetric mass distributions can obtain a
finite ellipticity. These results indicate a significant effect of the SPT on
quantitative analyses of lens systems. We show that the mass inside the
Einstein radius of the original mass distribution is conserved by the SPT;
hence, as is the case for the MST, the SPT does not affect the mass
determination at the Einstein radius. [...]

overload feature of SCMA to support massive device connectivity and expand
network capacity. Particularly, we develop a stochastic geometry based
framework to model and analyze SCMA, considering underlaid and overlaid mode.
Based on the results, we analytically compare SCMA with orthogonal
frequency-division multiple access (OFDMA) using area spectral efficiency (ASE)
and quantify closed-form ASE gain of SCMA over OFDMA. Notably, it is shown that
system ASE can be significantly improved using SCMA and the ASE gain scales
linearly with the SCMA codeword dimension. Besides, we endow D2D users with an
activated probability to balance cross-tier interference in the underlaid mode
and derive the optimal activated probability. Meanwhile, we study resource
allocation in the overlaid mode and obtain the optimal codebook allocation
rule. It is interestingly found that the optimal SCMA codebook allocation rule
is independent of cellular network parameters when cellular users are densely
deployed. The results are helpful in the implementation of SCMA in the hybrid

calculations use a simple two-diabatic state model that permits symmetric and
asymmetric bonds, i.e. where the proton affinity of the donor and acceptor are
equal and unequal, respectively. The dipole moment function uses a Mecke form
for the free OH dipole moment, associated with the diabatic states. The
transition dipole moment is calculated using one-dimensional vibrational
eigenstates associated with the H-atom transfer coordinate on the ground state
adiabatic surface of our model. Over 20-fold intensity enhancements for the
fundamental are found for strong H-bonds, where there are significant
non-Condon effects. The isotope effect on the intensity yields a non-monotonic
H/D intensity ratio as a function of R, and is enhanced by the secondary
geometric isotope effect. The first overtone intensity is found to vary
non-monotonically with H-bond strength; strong enhancements are possible for
strong H-bonds. Modifying the dipole moment through the Mecke parameters is
found to have a stronger effect on the overtone than the fundamental. We
compare our findings with those for specific molecular systems analysed through
experiments and theory in earlier works. Our model results compare favourably
for strong and medium strength symmetric H-bonds. However, for weak asymmetric

Seyfert galaxy IRAS 18325-5926 obtained from the 2001 XMM-Newton EPIC pn
observation of a 120 ks duration. While the X-ray source is highly variable,
the 8-10 keV band shows larger variability than that of the lower energies.
Amplified 8-10 keV flux variations are associated with two prominent flares of
the X-ray source during the observation. The Fe K emission is peaked at 6.6 keV
with moderate broadening. It is likely to originate from a highly ionized disc
with the ionization parameter of log xi ~3. The Fe K line flux responds to the
major flare, supporting its disc origin. There is a short burst of the Fe line
flux with no relation to the continuum brightness for which we have no clear
explanation. We also find transient, blueshifted Fe K absorption features,
which can be identified with high-velocity (~0.2 c) outflows of highly ionized
gas, as found in other active galaxies. The deepest absorption feature appears
only briefly (~1 hr) at the onset of the major flare and disappears when the
flare is declining. The rapid evolution of the absorption spectrum makes this
source peculiar among the active galaxies with high velocity outflows. Another
detection of the absorption feature also precedes the other flare. The
variability of the absorption feature partly accounts for the excess
variability in the 8-10 keV band where the absorption feature appears. Although
no reverberation measurement is available, the black hole mass of 2e6 Msun is
inferred from the X-ray variability. When this mass is assumed, the black hole
is accreting at around the Eddington limit, which may fit the highly ionized

during which the orbits of the giant planets became very unstable. In recent
years, many studies have identified traces of this event and have provided
reasonable justification for this occurrence. The magnitude (in terms of
orbital variation) and the timing of the instability though (early or late with
respect to the dispersal of the gas disk) still remains an open debate. The
terrestrial planets seem to set a strict constraint: either the giant planet
instability happened early, while the terrestrial planets were still forming,
or the orbits of Jupiter and Saturn had to separate from each other
impulsively, with a large enough `jump' in semimajor axis (Brasser et al. 2009;
Kaib and Chambers 2016) for the terrestrial planets to remain stable. Because a
large orbital jump is a low probability event, the early instability hypothesis
seems to be favored. However, the asteroid belt would also evolve in a
different way, assuming different instability amplitudes. These two constraints
need to match each other in order to favor one scenario over the other.
Considering an initially dynamically cold disk of asteroids, Morbidelli et al.
(2010) concluded that a comparably large jump is needed to reconstruct the
current asteroid belt. Here we confirm the same conclusion, but considering an
asteroid population already strongly excited in eccentricity, such as that
produced in the Grand Tack scenario (Walsh et al. 2011). Because the asteroids
existed since the time of removal of the gas disk, unlike the terrestrial
planets, this constraint on the width of the giant planet jump is valid
regardless of whether the instability happened early or late. Hence, at this
stage, assuming an early instability does not appear to provide any advantage
in terms of the probabilistic reconstruction of the solar system structure.

to estimate directionality in brain-behavior interactions. After source
reconstruction, activity within specific frequency bands in a priori regions of
interest was linked to continuous behavioral measurements, and we used a
predictive filtering scheme to estimate the asymmetry between brain-to-behavior

driving task and examine directed relationships between brain activity and
continuous driving behavior (steering or heading error). Our results indicated
that two neuro-behavioral states emerge in this naturalistic environment: a
Proactive brain state that actively plans the response to the sensory
information, and a Reactive brain state that processes incoming information and

cube of the central cavity obtained with SPIFFI on the VLT. The observed field
of view is 36""x 29"" , with a spectral resolution R = 1 300 in the
near-infrared. These observations cover several H2 lines. To preserve the
spatial resolution and avoid edge effects, we applied a new line-fitting method
that consists of a regularized 3D fitting. We also applied a more classical 1D
fitting to compare the relative strength of the H2 lines. Results. We present
high spatial and spectral resolution maps of the intensity, velocity, and width
of five H2 lines and an extinction map derived from H2. Molecular gas is
detected everywhere in the field. In particular, in addition to the known CND
features, we detected an emission from the northern arm cloud and from the
minicavity. The excitation diagrams allow us to estimate the temperature, mass,
and density of these features. Conclusions. We interpret the CND emission as
coming from a hot, thermalized, thin layer at the surface of the clouds. The
observed H2 corresponds only to a small fraction of the total H2 mass. The
emission remains fairly strong in the whole central cavity, but it is not
thermalized. A strong deviation from thermal equilibrium is detected near the
minicavity. We suggest that this emission is caused by constantly forming H2
that is destroyed again before it reaches ortho/para equilibrium.

cell clocks of high frequency stability. In the constructive polarization
modulation CPT scheme, a bichromatic laser field with polarization and phase
synchronously modulated is applied on an atomic medium. A high contrast CPT
signal is observed in this so-called double-modulation configuration, due to
the fact that the atomic population does not leak to the extreme Zeeman states,
and that the two CPT dark states, which are produced successively by the
alternate polarizations, add constructively. Here we experimentally investigate
CPT signal dynamics first in the usual configuration, a single circular
polarization. The double-modulation scheme is then addressed in both cases: one
pulse Rabi interaction and two pulses Ramsey interaction. The impact and the
optimization of the experimental parameters involved in the time sequence are
reviewed. We show that a simple sevenlevel model explains the experimental
observations. The double-modulation scheme yields a high contrast similar to
the one of other high contrast configurations like push-pull optical pumping or
crossed linear polarization scheme, with a setup allowing a higher compactness.
The constructive polarization modulation is attractive for atomic clock, atomic
magnetometer and high precision spectroscopy applications.

follows the power law. It can be proved that the correlation exponent is the
second order generalized dimension. The spatial correlation model is applied to
the system of cities in China. The results show that the Chinese urban system
can be described by the correlation dimension ranging from 1.3 to 1.6. The
fractality of self-organized network of cities in both the conventional
geographic space and the ""time"" space is revealed with the empirical evidence.
The spatial correlation analysis is significant in that it is applicable to
both large and small sizes of samples and can be used to link different fractal

  Given a colored graph X=(V,E,c), compute a minimum cardinality set S of

closely related problem is computing a minimum base S for a permutation group G
on [n] given by generators, i.e., a minimum cardinality subset S of [n] such
that no nontrivial permutation in G fixes all elements of S. Our focus is
mainly on the parameterized complexity of these problems. We show that when
k=|S| is treated as parameter, then both problems are MINI[1]-hard. For the
dual problems, where k=n-|S| is the parameter, we give FPT algorithms.
  A notion closely related to fixing is called individualization.
Individualization combined with the Weisfeiler-Leman procedure is a fundamental
technique in algorithms for Graph Isomorphism. Motivated by the power of
individualization, in the present paper we explore the complexity of
individualization: what is the minimum number of vertices we need to
individualize in a given graph such that color refinement ""succeeds"" on it.
Here ""succeeds"" could have different interpretations, and we consider the
following: It could mean the individualized graph becomes: (a) discrete, (b)
amenable, (c) compact, or (d) refinable. In particular, we study the
parameterized versions of these problems where the parameter is the number of
vertices individualized. We show a dichotomy: For graphs with color classes of
size at most 3 these problems can be solved in polynomial time (even in
logspace), while starting from color class size 4 they become W[P]-hard.

central role in cold and ultra-cold molecular processes, where long range
forces have been found to significantly depend on orientation in ultra-cold
polar molecule collisions. Recent experiments have demonstrated the emergence
of quantum phenomena such as scattering resonances in the cold collisions
regime due to quantization of the intermolecular degrees of freedom. Although
these states have been shown to be sensitive to interaction details, the effect
of anisotropy on quantum resonances has eluded experimental observation so far.
Here, we directly measure the anisotropy in atom-molecule interactions via
quantum resonances by changing the quantum state of the internal molecular
rotor. We observe that a quantum scattering resonance at a collision energy of
$k_B$ x 270 mK appears in the Penning ionization of molecular hydrogen with
metastable helium only if the molecule is rotationally excited. We use state of
the art ab initio and multichannel quantum molecular dynamics calculations to
show that the anisotropy contributes to the effective interaction only for
$H_2$ molecules in the first excited rotational state, whereas rotationally
ground state $H_2$ interacts purely isotropically with metastable helium.
Control over the quantum state of the internal molecular rotation allows us to
switch the anisotropy on or off and thus disentangle the isotropic and
anisotropic parts of the interaction. These quantum phenomena provide a
challenging benchmark for even the most advanced theoretical descriptions,
highlighting the advantage of using cold collisions to advance the microscopic
understanding of particle interactions.

be described with Clark's model. Because of this, the spatial distribution of
urban population used to be regarded as non-fractal pattern. However, Clark's
model differs from the exponential function in mathematics because that urban
population is distributed on the fractal support of landform and land-use form.
By using mathematical transform and empirical evidence, we argue that there are
self-affine scaling relations and local power laws behind the exponential
distribution of urban density. The scale parameter of Clark's model indicating
the characteristic radius of cities is not a real constant, but depends on the
urban field we defined. So the exponential model suggests local fractal
structure with two kinds of fractal parameters. The parameters can be used to
characterize urban space filling, spatial correlation, self-affine properties,
and self-organized evolution. The case study of the city of Hangzhou, China, is
employed to verify the theoretical inference. Based on the empirical analysis,
a three-ring model of cities is presented and a city is conceptually divided
into three layers from core to periphery. The scaling region and non-scaling
region appear alternately in the city. This model may be helpful for future
urban studies and city planning.

out three observations that have not been made in the literature to date: (i)
period enforcement is not strictly superior (compared to the base case without
enforcement) as it can cause deadline misses in self-suspending task sets that
are schedulable without enforcement; (ii) to match the assumptions underlying
the analysis of the period enforcer, a schedulability analysis of
self-suspending tasks subject to period enforcement requires a task set
transformation for which no solution is known in the general case, and which is
subject to exponential time complexity (with current techniques) in the limited
case of a single self-suspending task; and (iii) the period enforcer algorithm
is incompatible with all existing analyses of suspension-based locking
protocols, and can in fact cause ever-increasing suspension times until a
deadline is missed.

in video surveillance yet it is still a challenging problem. One of the major
challenges lies in the lack of spatial and temporal cues, which makes it
difficult to deal with large variations of lighting conditions, viewing angles,
body poses and occlusions. Recently, several deep learning based person
re-identification approaches have been proposed and achieved remarkable
performance. However, most of those approaches extract discriminative features
from the whole frame at one glimpse without differentiating various parts of
the persons to identify. It is essentially important to examine multiple highly
discriminative local regions of the person images in details through multiple
glimpses for dealing with the large appearance variance. In this paper, we
propose a new soft attention based model, i.e., the end to-end Comparative
Attention Network (CAN), specifically tailored for the task of person
re-identification. The end-to-end CAN learns to selectively focus on parts of
pairs of person images after taking a few glimpses of them and adaptively
comparing their appearance. The CAN model is able to learn which parts of
images are relevant for discerning persons and automatically integrates
information from different parts to determine whether a pair of images belongs
to the same person. In other words, our proposed CAN model simulates the human
perception process to verify whether two images are from the same person.
Extensive experiments on three benchmark person re-identification datasets,
including CUHK01, CHUHK03 and Market-1501, clearly demonstrate that our
proposed end-to-end CAN for person re-identification outperforms well
established baselines significantly and offer new state-of-the-art performance.

calculation of various derivatives with respect to the model parameters.
  We employ the adjoint state method (ASM) for efficient computation of the
first and the second derivatives of likelihood functionals constrained by ODEs
with respect to the parameters of the underlying ODE model. Essentially, the
gradient can be computed with a cost (measured by model evaluations) that is
independent of the number of the ODE model parameters and the Hessian with a
linear cost in the number of the parameters instead of the quadratic one. The
sensitivity analysis becomes feasible even if the parametric space is
high-dimensional.
  The main contributions are derivation and rigorous analysis of the ASM in the
statistical context, when the discrete data are coupled with the continuous ODE
model. Further, we present a highly optimized implementation of the results and
its benchmarks on a number of problems.
  The results are directly applicable in (e.g.) maximum-likelihood estimation
or Bayesian sampling of ODE based statistical models, allowing for faster, more
stable estimation of parameters of the underlying ODE model.

differences between the new graph and the original graph, as compared by any
number of graph properties, are important indicators of the biases inherent in
any modelling task. But these critical differences are subtle and not
immediately apparent using standard performance metrics. Therefore, we
introduce the infinity mirror test for the analysis of graph generator
performance and robustness. This stress test operates by repeatedly,
recursively fitting a model to itself. A perfect graph generator would have no
deviation from the original or ideal graph, however the implicit biases and
assumptions that are cooked into the various models are exaggerated by the
infinity mirror test allowing for new insights that were not available before.
We show, via hundreds of experiments on 6 real world graphs, that several
common graph generators do degenerate in interesting and informative ways. We
believe that the observed degenerative patterns are clues to future development
of better graph models.

where the fine tuning measures $\Delta_Z$ and $\Delta_h$ at the electroweak
scale are less than about 50, then we implement by simulations the constraints
of the direct searches on the parameter points in the region. Our results
indicate that although the direct search experiments are effective in excluding
the points, the parameter intervals for the region and also the minimum reaches
of $\Delta_Z$ and $\Delta_h$ are scarcely changed by the constraints, which
implies that the fine tuning of the NMSSM does not get worse after LHC Run I.
Moreover, based on the results we propose a natural NMSSM scenario where the
lightest neutralino $\tilde{\chi}_1^0$ as the dark matter (DM) candidate is
Higgsino-dominated. In this scenario, $\Delta_Z$ and $\Delta_h$ may be as low
as 2 without conflicting with any experimental constraints, and intriguingly
$\tilde{\chi}_1^0$ can easily reach the measured DM relic density due to its
significant Singlino component. We exhibit the features of the scenario which
distinguish it from the other natural SUSY scenario, including the properties
of its neutralino-chargino sector and scalar top quark sector. We emphasize
that the scenario can be tested either through searching for $3 l + E_T^{miss}$

proportional to the quantity's current value. Surprisingly, when exponential
growth data is plotted as a simple histogram disregarding the time dimension, a
remarkable fit to the positively skewed k/x distribution is found, where the
small is numerous and the big is rare. Such quantitative preference for the
small has a corresponding digital preference known as Benford's Law which
predicts that the first significant digit on the left-most side of numbers in
typical real-life data is proportioned between all possible 1 to 9 digits
approximately as in LOG(1 + 1/digit), so that low digits occur much more
frequently than high digits in the first place. Exponential growth series with
high growth rate are nearly perfectly Benford given that plenty of elements are
considered. An additional constraint is that the logarithm of the growth factor
must be an irrational number. Since the irrationals vastly outnumber the
rationals, on the face of it, this constraint seems to constitute the
explanation of why almost all growth series are Benford, yet, in reality this
is all too simplistic, and the real and more complex explanation is provided in
this article. Empirical examinations of close to a half a million growth series
via computerized programs almost perfectly match the prediction of the
theoretical study on rational versus irrational occurrences, thus in a sense
confirming both, the empirical work as well as the theoretical study. In
addition, a rigorous mathematical proof is provided in the continuous growth
case showing that it exactly obeys Benford's Law. A non-rigorous proof is given
in the discrete case via uniformity of mantissa argument. Finally cases of
discrete series embedded within continuous series are studied, detailing the
degree of deviation from the ideal Benford configuration.

reversal of spintronic devices such as magnetic tunnel junctions (MTJ)
currently hinder their wide implementation into memory and logic devices. This
problem is further exacerbated as the dimensions of MTJ nanostructures are
scaled down to tens of nanometers in diameter, as higher magnetic anisotropy
materials are required to meet thermal stability requirements that demand
higher switching current densities. Here, we propose a simple solution to these
issues based on synthetic ferrimagnet (SFM) structures. It is commonly assumed
that to achieve a given switching delay, the current has to exceed the critical
current by a certain factor and so a higher critical current implies a higher
switching current. We show that this is not the case for SFM structures which
can provide significantly reduced switching delay for a given current density,
even though the critical current is increased. This non-intuitive result can be
understood from the requirements of angular momentum conservation. We conclude
that a 20 nm diameter MTJ incorporating the proposed SFM free layer structure
can be switched in tens of picosecond time scales. This remarkable switching
speed can be attained by employing current perpendicular magnetic anisotropy
materials with experimentally demonstrated exchange coupling strengths.

task, with diverse applications ranging from natural to social sciences. Within
the scope of nonparametric time series, causal inference defined through
interventions (cf. Pearl (2000)) is largely unexplored, although time order
simplifies the problem substantially. We consider a marginal integration scheme
for inferring causal effects from observational time series data, MINT-T
(marginal integration in time series), which is an adaptation for time series
of a method proposed by Ernest and B\""{u}hlmann (Electron. J. Statist, pp.
3155-3194, vol. 9, 2015) for the case of independent data. Our approach for
stationary stochastic processes is fully nonparametric and, assuming no
instantaneous effects consistently recovers the total causal effect of a single
intervention with optimal one-dimensional nonparametric convergence rate
$n^{-2/5}$ assuming regularity conditions and twice differentiability of a
certain corresponding regression function. Therefore, MINT-T remains largely
unaffected by the curse of dimensionality as long as smoothness conditions hold
in higher dimensions and it is feasible for a large class of stationary time
series, including nonlinear and multivariate processes. For the case with
instantaneous effects, we provide a procedure which guards against false
positive causal statements.

information and energy transmission in the $K$-user Gaussian multiple access
channel (G-MAC), with an arbitrary $K \geqslant 2$ and one non-colocated energy
harvester (EH), are fully characterized.
  The objective of the transmitters is twofold. First, they aim to reliably
communicate their message indices to the receiver; and second, to harvest
energy at the EH at a rate not less than a minimum rate requirement $b$. The
information rates $R_1,\dots,R_K$, in bits per channel use, are measured at the
receiver and the energy rate $B$ is measured at an EH.
  Stability is considered in the sense of an $\eta$-Nash equilibrium
($\eta$-NE), with $\eta > 0$.
  The main result is a full characterization of the $\eta$-NE
information-energy region, i.e., the set of information-energy rate tuples
$(R_1,\dots,R_K,B)$ that are achievable and stable in the G-MAC when:
  $(a)$ all the transmitters autonomously and independently tune their own
transmit configurations seeking to maximize their own information transmission
rates $R_1,\dots, R_K$; and
  $(b)$ all the transmitters jointly guarantee an energy transmission rate $B$
at the EH, such that $B \geqslant b$.
  Therefore, any rate tuple outside the $\eta$-NE region is not stable as there
always exists at least one transmitter able to increase by at least $\eta$ bits
per channel use its own information transmission rate by updating its own
transmit configuration.

difference on strain energy to approximate stress. Then, we perturb again to
get difference in stress to approximate tangent modulus. Accuracy of the
approximations were evaluated across the perturbation parameter space, where we
find the optimal amount of perturbation being $10^{-6}$ to obtain stress and
$10^{-4}$ to obtain tangent modulus. Single element verification in ABAQUS with
Neo-Hookean material resulted in a small stress error of only $7\times10^{-5}$
on average across uniaxial compression and tension, biaxial tension and simple
shear situations. A full 3D model with Holzapfel anisotropic material for

  Benford's distribution?","7 pages, 3 figures and one potrait","Journal of Astrophysics and Astronomy 38 (2017) 7","10.1007/s12036-017-9427-z",,"astro-ph.EP physics.class-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In many real life situations, it is observed that the first digits (i.e.,
$1,2,\ldots,9$) of a numerical data-set, which is expressed using decimal
system, do not follow a random distribution. Instead, smaller numbers are
favoured by nature in accordance with a logarithmic distribution law, which is
referred to as Benford's law. The existence and applicability of this empirical
law have been extensively studied by physicists, accountants, computer
scientists, mathematicians, statisticians, etc., and it has been observed that
a large number of data-sets related to diverse problems follow this
distribution. However, applicability of Benford's law has been hardly tested
for extrasolar objects. Motivated by this fact, this paper investigates the
existence of Benford's distribution in the extrasolar world using Kepler data
for exoplanets. The investigation has revealed the presence of Benford's
distribution in various physical properties of these exoplanets. Further,
Benford goodness parameters are computed to provide a quantitative measure of
coincidence of real data with the ideal values obtained from Benford's
distribution. The quantitative analysis and the plots have revealed that
several physical parameters associated with the exoplanets (e.g., mass, volume,
density, orbital semi-major axis, orbital period, and radial velocity) nicely
follow Benford's distribution, whereas some physical parameters (e.g., total
proper motion, stellar age and stellar distance) moderately follow the
distribution, and some others (e.g., longitude, radius, and effective
temperature) do not follow Benford's distribution. Further, some specific
comments have been made on the possible generalizations of the obtained result,
its potential applications in analyzing data-set of candidate exoplanets, and
how interested readers can perform similar investigations on other interesting
data-sets.

neutron stars, since the hadron-quark phase transition softens the equation of
state (EOS) and reduce the neutron star (NS) maximum mass very significantly.
In this work, we consider the light U-boson that increases the NS maximum mass
appreciably through its weak coupling to fermions. The inclusion of the U-boson
may thus allow the existence of the quark degrees of freedom in the interior of
large mass neutron stars. Unlike the consequence of the U-boson in hadronic
matter, the stiffening role of the U-boson in the hybrid EOS is not sensitive
to the choice of the hadron phase models. In addition, we have also
investigated the effect of the effective QCD correction on the hybrid EOS. This
correction may reduce the coupling strength of the U-boson that is needed to
satisfy NS maximum mass constraint. While the inclusion of the U-boson also
increases the NS radius significantly, we find that appropriate in-medium
effects of the U-boson may reduce the NS radii significantly, satisfying both
the NS radius and mass constraints well.
