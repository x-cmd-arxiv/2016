for instance neural networks , may exhibit collective periodic behavior even
though single components have no natural tendency to behave periodically.
Macroscopic oscillations are indeed one of the most common self-organized
behavior observed in living systems. In the present paper we study some
dynamical features of a two-population generalization of the mean field Ising
model with the scope of investigating simple mechanisms capable to generate
rhythm in large groups of interacting individuals. We show that the system may
undergo a transition from a disordered phase, where the magnetization of each
population fluctuates closely around zero, to a phase in which they both
display a macroscopic regular rhythm. In particular, there exists a region in
the parameter space where having two groups of spins with inter- and
intra-population interactions of different strengths suffices for the emergence
of a robust periodic behavior.

jets are measurable quantities. Unfortunately, the currently employed methods
do not agree and the results are controversial. Two major issues concern the
measurements of BH spin and beam (jet) power. The former issue can be resolved
by future observations. But the latter issue can be resolved now, if we pay
attention to what is expected from theoretical considerations. The question of
whether a correlation has been found between the power outputs of few objects
and the spins of their BHs is moot because BH beam power does not scale with
the square of the spin of the BH. We show that the theoretical BH beam power is
a strongly nonlinear function of spin that cannot be approximated by a
quadratic relation, as is generally stated when the influence of the magnetic
field is not accounted for in the \cite{bla77} model. The BH beam power of
ballistic jets should scale a lot more steeply with BH spin irrespective of the
magnetic field assumed to thread the horizon and the spin range considered.
This behavior may already be visible in the analyses of radio observations by
\cite{nar12} and \cite{rus13}. In agreement with previous studies, we also find
that the power output that originates in the inner regions of the surrounding
accretion disks is higher than that from the BHs and it cannot be ignored in
investigations of continuous compact jets from these systems.

the symmetry properties of the impurity binding to graphene. In particular, we
show that electronic scattering is suppressed when dopants are bound
symmetrically to both graphene sub-lattices, giving rise to impurity
invisibility. In contrast, dopants that affect the two sublattices
asymmetrically are more strongly scattered and therefore the most likely
candidates to being chemically sensed by graphene. Furthermore, we demonstrate
that impurity invisibility is lifted with the introduction of a
symmetry-breaking perturbation such as uniaxial strain. In this case, graphene
with sublattice-symmetric dopants will function as efficient strain sensors. We
argue that by classifying dopants through their bonding symmetry leads to a
more efficient way of identifying suitable components for graphene-based

to do so, we use the NNPDF set, which comes with a set of replicas to estimate

becomes dominant over DY above a dilepton invariant mass of 3 TeV. On the other
hand, the PI predictions are affected by a large error coming from the QED
PDFs, well above the one affecting the DY mode. We assess the impact of these

neutral massive vector boson (Z') through the differential cross section and
Forward-Backward Asymmetry (AFB) observables as a function of the dilepton
invariant mass. While the former is subject to the aforementioned significant

immersed in a bright thermal bath, with the aim of detecting the presence of a
possible low-reflective object. If the signal is entangled with the receiver,
then a suitable choice of the measurement offers a gain with respect to the
optimal classical protocol employing coherent states. Here, we tackle this
detection problem by using quantum estimation techniques to measure the
reflectivity parameter of the object, showing an enhancement in the
signal-to-noise ratio up to 3 dB with respect to the classical case when
implementing only local measurements. Our approach employs the quantum Fisher
information to provide an upper bound for the error probability, supplies the
concrete estimator saturating the bound, and extends the quantum illumination
protocol to non-Gaussian states. As an example, we show how Schrodinger's cat

parameter estimation for hierarchical models. When the model expands due to an
increasing number of hierarchical levels, number of groups at a particular

illustrate how the steps in an MCMC for hierarchical models are predominantly
one of two types: conditionally independent draws or low-dimensional draws
based on summary statistics of parameters at higher levels of the hierarchy.
Parallel computing can increase efficiency by performing embarrassingly
parallel computations for conditionally independent draws and calculating the
summary statistics using parallel reductions. During the MCMC algorithm, we
record running means and means of squared parameter values to allow convergence
diagnosis and posterior inference while avoiding the costly memory transfer

introduce a novel approach to reformulate the EST in matrix formalism. We
propose that the matrix representation of EST will facilitate the calculations
in this framework. The method is to discretize the two-dimensional plane of
variance and density contrast of EST, where the trajectories for each point in
the Universe lived there. The probability of having a density contrast in a
chosen variance is represented by a probability ket. Naturally, the concept of
the transition matrix pops up to define the trajectories. We also define the
probability transition rate which is used to obtain the first up-crossing of
trajectories and the number count of the structures. In this work we show that
the discretization let us study the non-Markov processes by forcing them to
look like a Wiener process. Also we discuss that the zero drift processes with
Gaussian and also non-Gaussian initial conditions can be studied by this

Fokker-Planck dispersion equation is recovered. Finally we show that the

interactions that we call binding dominance. We investigated a biophysical
model of gene regulation, where the fractional occupancy of a transcription
factor (TF) on the cis-regulated promoter site it binds to is determined by
binding energy (-{\Delta}G) and TF dosage. Transcription and gene expression
proceed when the TF is bound to the promoter. In diploids, individuals may be
heterozygous at the cis-site, at the TF's coding region, or at the TF's own
promoter, which determines allele-specific dosage. We find that when the TF's
coding region is heterozygous, TF alleles compete for occupancy at the cis
sites and the tighter-binding TF is dominant in proportion to the difference in
binding strength. When the TF's own promoter is heterozygous, the TF produced
at the higher dosage is also dominant. Cis-site heterozygotes have additive
expression and therefore codominant phenotypes. Binding dominance propagates to
affect the expression of downstream loci and it is sensitive in both magnitude
and direction to genetic background, but its detectability often attenuates.
While binding dominance is inevitable at the molecular level, it is difficult
to detect in the phenotype under some biophysical conditions, more so when TF
dosage is high and allele-specific binding affinities are similar. A body of
empirical research on the biophysics of TF binding demonstrates the
plausibility of this mechanism of dominance, but studies of gene expression
under competitive binding in heterozygotes in a diversity of genetic
backgrounds are needed.

the steepest parts of the surface evolve as one-dimensional curves which move
in the normal direction at constant velocity. The curves are a special solution
to the nonlinear equations that arises spontaneously whenever the initial
patterning on the surface contains slopes larger than a critical value;
mathematically they are traveling waves (shocks) that have the special property
of being undercompressive. We derive the evolution equation for the curves by
considering long-wavelength perturbations to the one-dimensional traveling
wave, using the unusual boundary conditions required for an undercompressive
shock, and we show this equation accurately describes the evolution of shapes
on surfaces, both in simulations and in experiments. Because evolving a
collection of one-dimensional curves is fast, this equation gives a
computationally efficient and intuitive method for solving the inverse problem
of finding the initial surface so the evolution leads to a desired target
pattern. We illustrate this method by solving for the initial surface that will
produce a lattice of diamonds connected by steep, sharp ridges, and

Planck observations because the spectral index of the produced curvature
perturbation falls outside observational bounds. To resurrect the model, a
number of modifications have been put forward but many of them spoil the
accidental cancellation that resolves the eta-problem and require complicated
Kahler constructions to counterbalance the lost cancellation. In contrast, in
this paper the model is rendered viable by supplementing the scenario with a
brief period of thermal inflation, which follows the reheating of primordial
inflation. The scalar field responsible for thermal inflation requires a large
non-zero vacuum expectation value (VEV) and a flat potential. We investigate
the VEV of such a flaton field and its subsequent effect on the inflationary
observables. We find that, for large VEV, minimal hybrid inflation in
supergravity produces a spectral index within the 1-sigma Planck bound and a
tensor-to-scalar ratio which may be observable in the near future. The
mechanism is applicable to other inflationary models.

provides important diagnostic, prognostic and predictive information for
guiding cancer diagnosis and therapy. Manual scoring of IHC images represents a
logistical challenge, as the process is labor intensive and time consuming.
Since the last decade, computational methods have been developed to enable the
application of quantitative methods for the analysis and interpretation of
protein expression in IHC images. These methods have not yet replaced manual
scoring for the assessment of IHC in the majority of diagnostic laboratories
and in many large-scale research studies. An alternative approach is
crowdsourcing the quantification of IHC images to an undefined crowd. The aim
of this study is to quantify IHC images for labeling of ER status with two
different crowdsourcing approaches, image labeling and nuclei labeling, and
compare their performance with automated methods. Crowdsourcing-derived scores
obtained greater concordance with the pathologist interpretations for both
image labeling and nuclei labeling tasks (83% and 87%), as compared to the
pathologist concordance achieved by the automated method (81%) on 5,483 TMA
images from 1,909 breast cancer patients. This analysis shows that
crowdsourcing the scoring of protein expression in IHC images is a promising
new approach for large scale cancer molecular pathology studies.

profiles but fixed energy requests, such as Plug-in Electric Vehicles (PEVs).
The proposed method uses a hierarchical control scheme based on a model

first stage computes a reachable reference that trades off deviation from the
nominal voltage with the required generation control. The second stage uses a
price-based objective to aggregate flexible loads and provide load shaping
services, while satisfying system constraints and users' preferences at all

illustrated on a 55 bus radial distribution network.

supersonic flows it is still not trivial to capture high quality images. In
this study we present a Schlieren setup that uses pulsed LEDs with high
currents (up to 18 Ampere) to increase the optical output to sufficient levels.
The bright and short pulses, down to 130 nanoseconds, allow detailed and sharp
imaging of the flow with a high spatial resolution adequate for supersonic
flow. The pulse circuit and pulse width determination are explained in detail.
As a test case we studied the near field of a 2 mm diameter sonic jet injected
transversely into a supersonic cross flow. This is a model flow for fuel
injection in scramjet engines, which is not yet fully understood. Owing to the
high resolution and accuracy of the images produced by the newly developed
system we prove the existence of a large (density) gradient wave traveling in
the windward subsonic region between the Mach barrel and the bowshock, which
hitherto was observed only in some numerical studies but not yet shown in

time-correlated images can be obtained, with an interframe time of 2
microseconds, so that also flow unsteadiness can be studied such as the
movement of shock waves and trajectories of vortices. The obtained results of
the jet penetration height are presented as a power law correlation. The

model there appear three heavy neutral leptons $N_1$, $N_2$, and $N_3$
corresponding to right-handed neutrinos. It has been known that the lightest
one $N_1$ with keV mass, which is a candidate for dark matter, gives a
negligible contribution to the $0 \nu \beta \beta$ decay. By contrast, the

baryogengesis. In this analysis, we find that the effective mass of the $0\nu

$N_2$ and $N_3$ constructive contribution when the mass difference becomes
larger and the mass ordering of active neutrinos is inverted. Such a
possibility will be explored by the current and near future experiments of the

necessitating the design of Quality-of-Service (QoS) aware packet scheduler. In
this paper, we classify the M2M uplink data into multiple QoS classes and use
sigmoidal function to map the delay requirements of each class onto utility
functions. We propose a proportionally fair delay-optimal multiclass packet
scheduler at AS that maximizes a system utility metric. We note that the
average class delay under any work-conserving scheduling policy can be realized
by appropriately time-sharing between all possible preemptive priority
policies. Therefore the optimal scheduler is determined using an iterative
process to determine the optimal time-sharing between all priority scheduling
policies, such that it results in maximum system utility. The proposed
scheduler can be implemented online with reduced complexity due to the
iterative optimization process. We then extend this work to determine jointly
optimal MA-AS channel allocation and packet scheduling scheme at the MAs and
AS. We first formulate a joint optimization problem that is solved centrally at
the AS and then propose a low complexity distributed optimization problem
solved independently at MAs and AS. We show that the distributed optimization
solution converges quickly to the centralized optimization result with minimal
information exchange overhead between MAs and AS. Using Monte-Carlo
simulations, we verify the optimality of the proposed scheduler and show that
it outperforms other state-of-the-art packet schedulers such as weighted round

scheduler is low delay jitter for delay-sensitive traffic.

and also include modifications to our fit procedure motivated by a companion
paper focused on $W^{\pm}$ mass extractions. The fit reported is now to 177
observables and emphasises the need for a consistent inclusion of theoretical
errors, and a consistent treatment of observables. Including charged current
data lifts the two-fold degeneracy previously encountered in LEP (and lower
energy) data, and allows us to set simultaneous constraints on 20 of 53 Wilson
coefficients in the SMEFT, consistent with our assumptions. This allows the
model independent inclusion of LEP data in SMEFT studies at LHC, which are
projected into the SMEFT in a consistent fashion. We show how stronger
constraints can be obtained by using some combinations of Wilson coefficients,
when making assumptions on the UV completion of the Standard Model, or in an
inconsistent analysis. We explain why strong bounds at the per-mille or

regularization scheme, where a one-dimensional Fermi surface is embedded in
$3-\epsilon$ dimensional momentum space. In three dimensions, quasilocal
marginal Fermi liquids arise both at the SDW and CDW critical points : the
speed of the collective mode along the ordering wavevector is logarithmically
renormalized to zero compared to that of Fermi velocity. Below three
dimensions, however, the SDW and CDW critical points exhibit drastically
different behaviors. At the SDW critical point, a stable anisotropic non-Fermi
liquid state is realized for small $\epsilon$, where not only time but also
different spatial coordinates develop distinct anomalous dimensions. The
non-Fermi liquid exhibits an emergent algebraic nesting as the patches of Fermi
surface are deformed into a universal power-law shape near the hot spots. Due
to the anisotropic scaling, the energy of incoherent spin fluctuations disperse
with different power laws in different momentum directions. At the CDW critical
point, on the other hand, the perturbative expansion breaks down immediately
below three dimensions as the interaction renormalizes the speed of charge
fluctuations to zero within a finite renormalization group scale through a
two-loop effect. The difference originates from the fact that the vertex
correction anti-screens the coupling at the SDW critical point whereas it
screens at the CDW critical point.

antiprotons at intensities exceeding those achieved presently at the AD by
factors of ten to one hundred. These facilities, operating in the energy regime
between 100 keV down to 20 keV, face several design and beam dynamics

of supervisory control of autonomous intersections in the presence of sensor

identifying these polyp-free segments could be of valuable use in reducing the

tested the ability of the collective crowd intelligence of non-expert workers

specificity of 86.5% in identifying video segments which contained a clinically
proven polyp. Since each polyp appeared in multiple consecutive segments, all
polyps were in fact identified. Using the crowd results as a first pass, 80% of
the video segments could in theory be skipped by the radiologist, equating to a
significant time savings and enabling more VC examinations to be performed.

penetrate the system through cyber means and cause significant physical damage.
Consequently, detection of such attacks becomes integral towards making these
systems resilient to attacks. To achieve this objective, intrusion detection
systems (IDS) that are able to detect malicious behavior can be deployed.
However, practical IDS are imperfect and sometimes they may produce false
alarms for a normal system behavior. Since alarms need to be investigated for
any potential damage, a large number of false alarms may increase the
operational costs significantly. Thus, IDS need to be configured properly, as
oversensitive IDS could detect attacks early but at the cost of a higher number
of false alarms. Similarly, IDS with low sensitivity could reduce the false
alarms while increasing the time to detect the attacks. The configuration of
IDS to strike the right balance between time to detecting attacks and the rate
of false positives is a challenging task, especially in dynamic environments,
in which the damage incurred by a successful attack is time-varying.
  In this paper, we study the problem of finding optimal detection thresholds
for anomaly-based detectors implemented in dynamical systems in the face of
strategic attacks. We formulate the problem as an attacker-defender security
game, and determine thresholds for the detector to achieve an optimal trade-off
between the detection delay and the false positive rates. In this direction,
first, we provide an algorithm that computes optimal fixed threshold that
remains fixed throughout. Second, we allow detector's threshold to change with
time to further minimize the defender's loss and provide an algorithm to
compute time-varying thresholds, which we call adaptive thresholds. Finally, we
numerically evaluate our results using a water distribution network as a
case-study.

there is the additional problem of the high dimensionality of the set of

that such a chaos is not an attractor (i.e. dynamics is not approaching the
chaos), instead a periodic attractor (of period 3 under the Poincar\'e period
map) exists near the chaos, and co-exists with another periodic attractor (of
period 1 under the Poincar\'e period map) near the market equilibrium. Outside
the basins of attraction of the two periodic attractors, the dynamics
approaches infinity indicating market irrational exuberance or flash crash. The
period 3 attractor represents the product's market cycle of growth and
recession, while period 1 attractor near the market equilibrium represents the
regular fluctuation of the product's market. Thus our model captures more
market phenomena besides Marshall's market equilibrium. When the fluctuation of
the determinants of demand and supply is strong enough, a three leaf danger
zone exists where the basins of attraction of all attractors intertwine and
fractal basin boundaries are formed. Small perturbations in the danger zone can
lead to very different attractors. That is, small perturbations in the danger
zone can cause the market to experience oscillation near market equilibrium,
large growth and recession cycle, and irrational exuberance or flash crash.

investigation on the effects of Cd doping in flux-grown single crystals of the
complex intermetallic cage compound YbFe$_{2}$Zn$_{20}$, that has been
described as a heavy fermion with Sommerfeld coefficient of 535 mJ/mol.K$^{2}$.
Substitution of Cd for Zn disturbs the system by expanding the unit cell and,
in this case, the size of the Zn cages that surround Yb and Fe. With increasing
amount of Cd, the hybridization between Yb $4f$ electrons and the conduction
electrons is weakened, as evidenced by a decrease in the Sommerfeld
coefficient, which should be accompanied by a valence shift of the Yb$^{3+}$
due to the negative chemical pressure effect. This scenario is also supported
by the low temperature dc-magnetic susceptibility, that is gradually suppressed
and evidences an increment of the Kondo temperature, based on a shift to higher
temperatures of the characteristic broad susceptibility peak. Furthermore, the
DC resistivity decreases with the isoelectronic Cd substitution for Zn,
contrary to the expectation for an increasingly disordered system, and implying
that the valence shift is not related to charge carrier doping. The combined
results demonstrate excellent complementarity between positive physical
pressure and negative chemical pressure, and point to a rich playground for
exploring the physics and chemistry of strongly correlated electron systems in
the general family of Zn$_{20}$ compounds, despite their structural complexity.

powerful sources of gravitational waves (GWs) in the frequency range of the

to form in the final stages of galaxy mergers, and then harden by slingshot
ejections of passing stars. However, evolution via the slingshot mechanism may
be ineffective if the reservoir of interacting stars is not readily
replenished, and the binary shrinking may come to a halt at roughly a parsec
separation. Recent simulations suggest that the departure from spherical
symmetry, naturally produced in merger remnants, leads to efficient loss cone
refilling, preventing the binary from stalling. However, current N-body
simulations able to accurately follow the evolution of BHBs are limited to very
modest particle numbers. Brownian motion may artificially enhance the loss cone
refilling rate in low-N simulations, where the binary encounters a larger
population of stars due its random motion. Here we study the significance of
Brownian motion of BHBs in merger remnants in the context of the final parsec
problem. We simulate mergers with various particle numbers (from 8k to 1M) and
with several density profiles. Moreover, we compare simulations where the BHB
is fixed at the centre of the merger remnant with simulations where the BHB is
free to random walk. We find that Brownian motion does not significantly affect
the evolution of BHBs in simulations with particle numbers in excess of one
million, and that the hardening measured in merger simulations is due to
collisionless loss cone refilling.

The precise ages of meteorites indicate that planetesimals - the building

life. A prominent question is: how early can one find fully formed planets like
those frequently detected on short orbital periods around mature stars? Some
theories suggest the in situ formation of planets close to their host stars is
unlikely and the existence of such planets is evidence for large scale
migration. Other theories posit that planet assembly at small orbital
separations may be common. Here we report on a newly-born, transiting planet
orbiting its star every 5.4 days. The planet is 50 per cent larger than
Neptune, and its mass is less than 3.6 times Jupiter (at 99.7 per cent

$\omega_J$ and $\omega$ being the large light-cone momentum component of the
jet and the corresponding parton $i$ that initiates the jet, respectively.
Within the framework of Soft Collinear Effective Theory (SCET) we calculate
both $J_q(z, \omega_J, \mu)$ and $J_g(z, \omega_J, \mu)$ to the next-to-leading
order (NLO) for cone and anti-k$_{\rm T}$ algorithms. We demonstrate that the

the usual DGLAP evolution, which can be used to perform the $\ln R$ resummation
for {\it inclusive} jet cross sections with a small jet radius $R$. We clarify
the difference between our RG equations for $J_i(z, \omega_J, \mu)$ and those

inclusive hadron production, with only the fragmentation functions $D_i^h(z,
\mu)$ replaced by $J_i(z, \omega_J, \mu)$. This can facilitate more efficient
higher-order analytical computations of jet cross sections. We further match

conceptual picture in which the properties of the CGM, and the key physics
governing it, change markedly near a critical halo mass of M$_{\rm crit}
\approx 10^{11.5}$ M$_\odot$. As in calculations without stellar feedback,
above M$_{\rm crit}$ halo gas is supported by thermal pressure created in the
virial shock. The thermal properties at small radii are regulated by feedback
triggered when $t_{\rm cool}/t_{\rm ff}\lesssim10$ in the hot gas. Below
M$_{\rm crit}$, however, there is no thermally supported halo and
self-regulation at $t_{\rm cool}/t_{\rm ff}\sim10$ does not apply. Instead, the
gas is out of hydrostatic equilibrium and largely supported against gravity by
bulk flows (turbulence and coherent inflow/outflow) arising from the
interaction between cosmological gas inflow and outflowing galactic winds. In
these lower mass haloes, the phase structure depends sensitively on the
outflows' energy per unit mass and mass-loading, which may allow measurements
of the CGM thermal state to constrain the nature of galactic winds. Our
simulations account for some of the properties of the multiphase halo gas
inferred from quasar absorption line observations, including the presence of
significant mass at a wide range of temperatures, and the characteristic OVI

black holes are rapidly rotating; however, selection biases suggest that these
results are not necessarily reflective of the majority of black holes in the
Universe. Tidal disruption events, where a star orbiting an otherwise dormant
black hole gets tidally shredded and accreted onto the black hole, can provide
a short, unbiased glimpse at the space-time around the other ninety per cent of
black holes. Observations of tidal disruptions have hitherto revealed the
formation of an accretion disk and the onset of an accretion-powered jet, but
have failed to reveal emission from the inner accretion flow, which enables the
measurement of black hole spin. Here we report observations of reverberation
arising from gravitationally redshifted iron K photons reflected off the inner
accretion flow in the tidal disruption event Swift J1644+57. From the
reverberation timescale, we estimate the mass of the black hole to be a few

compare non-cosmological galaxy disk runs with standard blastwave supernovae

runs with the new superbubble SN feedback, which produces winds naturally by
modelling the detailed physics of SN-driven bubbles and leads to efficient
self-regulation of star formation. We find that, with blastwave feedback,
massive star forming clumps form in comparable number and with very similar
masses in GASOLINE2 and GIZMO. The typical masses are in the range $10^7-10^8
M_{\odot}$, lower than in most previous works, while giant clumps with masses
above $10^9 M_{\odot}$ are exceedingly rare. With superbubble feedback,
instead, massive bound star forming clumps do not form because galaxies never
undergo a phase of violent disk instability. Only sporadic, unbound star
forming overdensities lasting only a few tens of Myr can arise that are
triggered by perturbations of massive satellite companions. We conclude that
there is a severe tension between explaining massive star forming clumps
observed at $z > 1$ primarily as the result of disk fragmentation driven by
gravitational instability and the prevailing view of feedback-regulated galaxy
formation. The link between disk stability and star formation efficiency should
thus be regarded as a key testing ground for galaxy formation theory.

evolutionary effects on the internal kinematics of star clusters. Previous
studies investigating the restricted three-body problem with applications to
star cluster dynamics have shown that unbound stars on retrograde orbits (with
respect to the direction of the cluster's orbit) are more stable against escape
than prograde orbits, and predicted that a star cluster might acquire
retrograde rotation through preferential escape of stars on prograde orbits. In
this study we present evidence of this prediction, but we also illustrate that
there are additional effects that cannot be accounted for by the preferential
escape of prograde orbits alone. Specifically, in the early evolution,
initially underfilling models increase their fraction of retrograde stars
without losing significant mass, and acquire a retrograde angular velocity. We
attribute this effect to the development of preferentially eccentric/radial
orbits in the outer regions of star clusters as they are expanding into their
tidal limitation.
  We explore the implications of the evolution of the fraction of prograde and
retrograde stars for the evolution of the cluster internal rotation, and its
dependence on the initial structural properties. Although all the systems
studied here evolve towards an approximately solid-body internal rotation with
angular velocity equal to about half of the angular velocity of the cluster
orbital motion around the host galaxy, the evolutionary history of the radial
profile of the cluster internal angular velocity depends on the cluster initial
structure.

increase the bending rigidity and reduce the in-plane elastic moduli in a

additional coupling between the shell curvature, the local in-plane stretching
modes and the local out-of-plane undulations, leads to novel phenomena. In
spherical shells thermal fluctuations produce a radius-dependent negative
effective surface tension, equivalent to applying an inward external pressure.
By adapting renormalization group calculations to allow for a spherical
background curvature, we show that while small spherical shells are stable,
sufficiently large shells are crushed by this thermally generated ""pressure"".
Such shells can be stabilized by an outward osmotic pressure, but the effective
shell size grows non-linearly with increasing outward pressure, with the same
universal power law exponent that characterizes the response of fluctuating

achieving nearly complete spin polarization of charge carriers in

half-vortices and disclinations. In this paper we present a Ginzburg-Landau

geometrical coupling between the superconductor and the nematic order

have found a restoring force between vortices and disclinations that produces
harmonic excitations whose natural frequency depends on the geometrical
coupling constant and the superconductor condensation energy. Moreover, in a
regime with high density of defects, we have found a structural phase
transition between vortex-disclination lattices with different symmetries.

theoretical investigation of the SO-driven band inversion in isostructural

the crystal-field effect. We calculate the SO-induced energy shift of states in
the top valence and bottom conduction manifolds and reproduce this behavior
using a simple one-atom model adjusted to incorporate the crystal-field effect.
The crystal-field splitting is shown to compete with the SO coupling, that is,
stronger crystal-field splitting leads to weaker SO band shift. We further show
how both these effects can be controlled by changing the chemical composition,
whereas the crystal-field splitting can be tuned by means of uniaxial strain.
These results provide a practical guidance to the rational design of novel TIs

paper, we analyse urban traffic with network and statistical methods. Our
analysis is based on one big bus dataset containing 45 million bus arrival
samples in Helsinki. We mainly address following questions: 1. How can we
identify the areas that cause most of the traffic in the city? 2. Why there is
a urban traffic? Is bus traffic a key cause of the urban traffic? 3. How can we
improve the urban traffic systems? To answer these questions, first, the
betweenness is used to identify the most import areas that cause most traffics.
Second, we find that bus traffic is not an important cause of urban traffic
using statistical methods. We differentiate the urban traffic and the bus
traffic in a city. We use bus delay as an identification of the urban traffic,
and the number of bus as an identification of the bus traffic. Third, we give
our solutions on how to improve urban traffic by the traffic simulation on road
networks. We show that adding more buses during the peak time and providing
better bus schedule plan in the hot areas like railway station, metro station,
shopping malls etc. will reduce the urban traffic.

information that can be used to probe isospin asymmetries and inform nuclear
astrophysics studies. Purpose: To measure the $\beta$-delayed $\gamma$ decay of
$^{26}$P and compare the results with previous experimental results and
shell-model calculations. Method: A $^{26}$P fast beam produced using nuclear
fragmentation was implanted into a planar germanium detector. Its
$\beta$-delayed $\gamma$-ray emission was measured with an array of 16
high-purity germanium detectors. Positrons emitted in the decay were detected
in coincidence to reduce the background. Results: The absolute intensities of
$^{26}$P $\beta$-delayed $\gamma$-rays were determined. A total of six new
$\beta$-decay branches and 15 new $\gamma$-ray lines have been observed for the
first time in $^{26}$P $\beta$-decay. A complete $\beta$-decay scheme was built
for the allowed transitions to bound excited states of $^{26}$Si. $ft$ values
and Gamow-Teller strengths were also determined for these transitions and
compared with shell model calculations and the mirror $\beta$-decay of
$^{26}$Na, revealing significant mirror asymmetries. Conclusions: A very good
agreement with theoretical predictions based on the USDB shell model is
observed. The significant mirror asymmetry observed for the transition to the
first excited state ($\delta=51(10)\%$) may be evidence for a proton halo in
$^{26}$P.

evidence of the use of data for commercial and national interests. Public

as differential privacy offer machine learning algorithms methods to guarantee
limits to information disclosure, but they are seldom implemented. Recently,
however, developers have made significant efforts to undermine tracking through
obfuscation tools that hide user characteristics in a sea of noise. These
services highlight an emerging clash between tracking and data obfuscation. In
this paper, we conceptualize this conflict through a dynamic game between users
and a machine learning algorithm that uses empirical risk minimization. First,
a machine learner declares a privacy protection level, and then users respond
by choosing their own perturbation amounts. We study the interaction between
the users and the learner using a Stackelberg game. The utility functions
quantify accuracy using expected loss and privacy in terms of the bounds of
differential privacy. In equilibrium, we find selfish users tend to cause
significant utility loss to trackers by perturbing heavily, in a phenomenon
reminiscent of public good games. Trackers, however, can improve the balance by
proactively perturbing the data themselves. While other work in this area has
studied privacy markets and mechanism design for truthful reporting of user
information, we take a different viewpoint by considering both user and learner
perturbation.

We present here a unified non-relativistic description of these two phenomena,

along the spin operator. Although the expectation value of $\vec{\cal D}$ in

clusters hosting AGN as a function of redshift and cluster richness for X-ray
detected AGN associated with clusters of galaxies in Dark Energy Survey (DES)
Science Verification data. The present sample includes 33 AGN with L_X > 10^43
ergs s^-1 in non-central, host galaxies with luminosity greater than 0.5 L*
from a total sample of 432 clusters in the redshift range of 0.1<z<0.95.
Analysis of the present sample reveals that the AGN fraction in red-sequence
cluster members has a strong positive correlation with redshift such that the
AGN fraction increases by a factor of ~8 from low to high redshift, and the
fraction of cluster galaxies hosting AGN at high redshifts is greater than the
low-redshift fraction at 3.6 sigma. In particular, the AGN fraction increases
steeply at the highest redshifts in our sample at z>0.7. This result is in good
agreement with previous work and parallels the increase in star formation in
cluster galaxies over the same redshift range. However, the AGN fraction in
clusters is observed to have no significant correlation with cluster mass.
Future analyses with DES Year 1 through Year 3 data will be able to clarify
whether AGN activity is correlated to cluster mass and will tightly constrain
the relationship between cluster AGN populations and redshift.

plagued with severe shortcomings and may become, in practical terms, dependent
on the choice of subjective threshold parameters in their implementations. In
two-dimensions, a large class of standard vortex identification prescriptions
turn out to be equivalent to the ""swirling strength criterion""
($\lambda_{ci}$-criterion), which is critically revisited in this work. We
classify the instances where the accuracy of the $\lambda_{ci}$-criterion is
affected by nonlinear superposition effects and propose an alternative vortex
detection scheme based on the local curvature properties of the vorticity graph
$(x,y,\omega)$ -- the ""vorticity curvature criterion""
($\lambda_\omega$-criterion) -- which improves over the results obtained with
the $\lambda_{ci}$-criterion in controlled Monte-Carlo tests. We show that the
$\lambda_\omega$-criterion is able to cope with strong shear effects, if a
subtraction of the mean velocity field background is performed, in the spirit
of the Reynolds decomposition procedure. A realistic comparative study for
vortex identification is then carried out for a direct numerical simulation
(DNS) of a turbulent channel flow, including a three-dimensional extension of
the $\lambda_\omega$-criterion. In contrast to the $\lambda_{ci}$-criterion,
the $\lambda_\omega$-criterion indicates in a consistent way the existence of
small scale isotropic turbulent fluctuations in the logarithmic layer, in
consonance with long-standing assumptions commonly taken in turbulent boundary

simultaneously the bar and a two-armed quasi-static spiral pattern. Away from
major resonance overlaps, the mean stellar radial motions in the plane are
essentially a linear superposition of the isolated effects of the bar and
spirals. Thus, provided the bar is strong enough, even in the presence of
spiral arms, these mean radial motions are predominantly affected by the
Galactic bar for large scale velocity fluctuations. This is evident when
comparing the peculiar line-of-sight velocity power spectrum of our coupled
models with bar-only models. However, we show how forthcoming spectroscopic
surveys could disentangle bar-only non-axisymmetric models of the Galaxy from
models in which spiral arms have a significant amplitude. We also point out
that overlaps of low-order resonances are sufficient to enhance stellar
churning within the disc, even when the spirals amplitude is kept constant.
Nevertheless, for churning to be truly non-local, stronger or (more likely)
transient amplitudes would be needed: otherwise the disc is actually mostly
unaffected by churning in the present models. Finally, regarding vertical
breathing modes, the combined effect of the bar and spirals on vertical motions
is a clear non-linear superposition of the isolated effects of both components,
significantly superseding the linear superposition of modes produced by each
perturber separately, thereby providing an additional effect to consider when
analysing the observed breathing mode of the Galactic disc in the extended
Solar neighbourhood.

parameters are constructed based on the generalized polynomial chaos (gPC)
expansion using simulation results on sampling points (e.g., individual
parameter sets). To alleviate the computational cost to evaluate the target

templates in terms of luminosity and light-curve stretch, clearly shows SN
2011kl is the most luminous GRB-SN to date, and it is spectrally very
dissimilar to other events, being significantly bluer/hotter. Although SN
2011kl does not reach the classical luminosity threshold of SLSNe and evolves
faster than any of them, it resembles SLSNe more than the classical
GRB-associated broad-lined Type Ic SNe in several aspects. GRB 111209A was a
very energetic event, both at early (prompt emission) and at very late (SN)
times. We have shown in a further publication that with the exception of the
extreme duration, the GRB and afterglow parameters are in agreement with the
known distributions for these parameters. SN 2011kl, on the other hand, is
exceptional both in luminosity and spectral characteristics, indicating that
GRB 111209A was likely not powered by a standard-model collapsar central

M2M uplink traffic at the M2M application server (AS). Due to the
delay-heterogeneity in uplink traffic, we classify it broadly into
delay-tolerant and delay-sensitive traffic. We then map the diverse delay
requirements of each class to sigmoidal functions of packet delay and formulate
a utility-maximization problem that results in a proportionally fair
delay-optimal scheduler. We note that solving this optimization problem is
equivalent to solving for the optimal fraction of time each class is served
with (preemptive) priority such that it maximizes the system utility. Using
Monte-Carlo simulations for the queuing process at AS, we verify the
correctness of the analytical result for optimal scheduler and show that it
outperforms other state-of-the-art packet schedulers such as weighted round
robin, max-weight scheduler, fair scheduler and priority scheduling. We also
note that at higher traffic arrival rate, the proposed scheduler results in a
near-minimal delay variance for the delay-sensitive traffic which is highly
desirable. This comes at the expense of somewhat higher delay variance for
delay-tolerant traffic which is usually acceptable due to its delay-tolerant
nature.

from a single progenitor population, multiple-beam FRB detection rates from the
Parkes telescope yield the constraint $0.52<\alpha<1.0$ with $90$% confidence.
Searches at other facilities with different dish sizes refine the constraint to
$0.66<\alpha<0.96$. Our results favor FRB searches with smaller dishes, because
for $\alpha<1$, the gain in field-of-view for a smaller dish is more important
than the reduction in sensitivity. Further, our results suggest that (i) FRBs
are not standard candles, and (ii) the distribution of distances to the

these results are consistent with a cosmological population, which would make
FRBs excellent probes of the baryonic content and geometry of the Universe.

Both linear and nonlinear equations are considered. We demonstrate the
effectiveness of the ROM by several numerical examples, in which the ROM
achieves the same accuracy of the full-order model (FOM) over a long-term

sensitive to what we do with the information. For example, Holevo's bound tells
us that n qubits only encode n bits of classical information but for certain
communication complexity tasks there is an exponential separation between
quantum and classical resources. Instead of just contrasting quantum and
classical physics, we can place both within a broad landscape of physical
theories and ask how non-quantum (and non-classical) theories are different
from, or more powerful than quantum theory. For example, in communication
complexity, certain (non-quantum) theories can trivialise all communication

can be taken as ""advice"" for computers in these theories and this advice allows
the computers to easily solve any decision problem. Aaronson has highlighted

various popular, non-wavefunction-based phenomenological measures - such as
observer, outcome or world counting - that are frequently demanded of
Everettians. These alternatives conflict, however, with the wavefunction
realism upon which Everett's approach rests, which seems to call for an
objective, basis-independent measure based only on wavefunction amplitudes. The
ability of quantum probabilities to destructively interfere with each other,
however, makes it difficult to see how probabilities can be derived solely from
amplitudes in an intuitively appealing way. I argue that the use of algorithmic
probability can solve this problem, since the objective, single-case
probability measure that wavefunction realism demands is exactly what
algorithmic information theory was designed to provide. The result is an
intuitive account of complex-valued amplitudes, as coefficients in an optimal
lossy data compression, such that changes in algorithmic information content

been created in the transition metal dichalcogenide (TMDC) monolayers using
excitation by circularly polarized light and has been detected both optically

pseudospin has been identified experimentally. The manipulation of such valley
coherence has, however, remained out of reach. Here we demonstrate an
all-optical control of the valley coherence by means of the pseudomagnetic
field associated with the optical Stark effect. Using below-bandgap circularly
polarized light, we experimentally rotate the valley exciton pseudospin in
monolayer WSe2 on the femtosecond time scale. Both the direction and speed of
the rotation can be optically manipulated by tuning the dynamic phase of
excitons in opposite valleys. This study completes the

hospitals are interested in pooling their medical records for research, but
none may disclose arbitrary patient records to researchers or other healthcare

federated database for querying over the collective data of mutually
distrustful parties. In a PDN, each member database does not reveal its tuples

query execution is oblivious, and its program counters and memory traces are
agnostic to the inputs of others. We introduce a framework for executing PDN

particular object within a large corpus. Recent studies show that using image
features generated by pooling convolutional layer feature maps (CFMs) of a
pretrained convolutional neural network (CNN) leads to promising performance
for this task. However, due to the global pooling strategy adopted in those
works, the generated image feature is less robust to image clutter and tends to
be contaminated by the irrelevant image patterns. In this article, we alleviate
this drawback by proposing a novel reranking algorithm using CFMs to refine the
retrieval result obtained by existing methods. Our key idea, called query
adaptive matching (QAM), is to first represent the CFMs of each image by a set
of base regions which can be freely combined into larger regions-of-interest.
Then the similarity between the query and a candidate image is measured by the
best similarity score that can be attained by comparing the query feature and
the feature pooled from a combined region. We show that the above procedure can
be cast as an optimization problem and it can be solved efficiently with an
off-the-shelf solver. Besides this general framework, we also propose two
practical ways to create the base regions. One is based on the property of the
CFM and the other one is based on a multi-scale spatial pyramid scheme. Through
extensive experiments, we show that our reranking approaches bring substantial
performance improvement and by applying them we can outperform the state of the
art on several instance retrieval benchmarks.

active galactic nuclei (AGN) on a contiguous field, using sources detected in
the Chandra COSMOS Legacy survey. The sample contains 174 sources, 87 with
spectroscopic redshift, the other 87 with photometric redshift (z_phot). In
this work we treat z_phot as a probability weighted sum of contributions,
adding to our sample the contribution of sources with z_phot<3 but z_phot
probability distribution >0 at z>3. We compute the number counts in the
observed 0.5-2 keV band, finding a decline in the number of sources at z>3 and
constraining phenomenological models of X-ray background. We compute the AGN
space density at z>3 in two different luminosity bins. At higher luminosities
(logL(2-10 keV) > 44.1 erg/s) the space density declines exponentially,
dropping by a factor ~20 from z~3 to z~6. The observed decline is ~80% steeper
at lower luminosities (43.55 erg/s < logL(2-10 keV) < 44.1 erg/s), from z~3 to
z~4.5. We study the space density evolution dividing our sample in optically
classified Type 1 and Type 2 AGN. At logL(2-10 keV) > 44.1 erg/s, unobscured
and obscured objects may have different evolution with redshift, the obscured
component being three times higher at z~5. Finally, we compare our space
density with predictions of quasar activation merger models, whose calibration
is based on optically luminous AGN. These models significantly overpredict the
number of expected AGN at logL(2-10 keV) > 44.1 erg/s with respect to our data.

examine the ground state phase diagram of the Hubbard model on the triangular
lattice at half filling. The calculation reveals two discontinuities in the
double occupancy with increasing the repulsive Hubbard interaction U at Uc1 =
7.55 t and Uc2 = 9.65 t (t being the hopping integral), indicating that there
are three phases separated by first order transitions. The absence of any
singularity in physical quantities for 0 < U < Uc1 implies that this phase
corresponds to a metallic phase. The local spin density induced by an applied
pinning magnetic field for U > Uc2 exhibits a three sublattice feature, which
is compatible with the Neel ordered state realized in the strong coupling
limit. For Uc1 < U < Uc2, a response to the applied pinning magnetic field is
comparable to that in the metallic phase but a relatively large spin
correlation length is found with neither valence bond nor chiral magnetic
order, suggesting a paramagnetic nature which resembles gapless spin liquid.
The calculation also finds that the pair- ing correlation function
monotonically decreases with increasing U and thus the superconductivity is
unlikely in the intermediate phase.

be probed effectively by stars. However, at larger distances planetary nebulae

PNe, Romanowsky et al. (2003) measured the dynamics of three luminous

the framework of MOdified Newtonian Dynamics (MOND). As more data are available

growing search market. The key difference between mobile search and desktop
search is that information presentation is limited to the screen space of the
mobile device. Thus, major search engines have adopted a new type of search
result presentation, known as \textit{information cards}, in which each card
presents summarized results from one domain/vertical, for a given query, to
augment the standard blue-links search results. While it has been widely
acknowledged that information cards are particularly suited to mobile user
experience, it is also challenging to optimize such result sets. Typically,
user engagement metrics like query reformulation are based on whole ranked list
of cards for each query and most traditional learning to rank algorithms
require per-item relevance labels. In this paper, we investigate the
possibility of interpreting query reformulation into effective relevance labels
for query-card pairs. We inherit the concept of conventional learning-to-rank,
and propose pointwise, pairwise and listwise interpretations for query
reformulation. In addition, we propose a learning-to-label strategy that learns
the contribution of each card, with respect to a query, where such
contributions can be used as labels for training card ranking models. We
utilize a state-of-the-art ranking model and demonstrate the effectiveness of
proposed mechanisms on a large-scale mobile data from a major search engine,
showing that models trained from labels derived from user engagement can
significantly outperform ones trained from human judgment labels.

  method","23 pages, 15 figures",,,,"hep-ex","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Many high-energy physics analyses require the presence of leptons from $W$,
$Z$, or $H$ boson decay. For these analyses, signatures that mimic such leptons
present a `fake lepton' background that must be estimated. Since the magnitude
of this background depends strongly upon details of the detector response, it
can be difficult to estimate with simulation. One data-driven approach is the
`matrix method', in which two categories of leptons are defined (`loose' and
`tight'), with the tight category being a subset of the loose category. Using
the populations of leptons in each category in the analysis sample, and the
efficiencies for both real and fake leptons in the loose category to satisfy
the criteria for the tight category, the fake background yield can be
estimated. This paper describes a Poisson likelihood implementation of the
matrix method, which provides a more precise, reliable, and robust estimate of
the fake background yield compared to an analytic solution. This implementation
also provides a reliable estimate of the background for cases in which the
analysis selection permits more loose leptons than tight leptons, potentially
allowing for greater selection efficiency.

tiles. On her turn, a player can either remove a positive number of tiles from
one stack, or remove an equal positive number of tiles from both stacks. The
last player to move legally wins the game. We propose and study a new extension
of this game to more than two stacks, which we call Twyst-off, inspired by the
Reidemeister moves of knot theory. From an ordered sequence of stacks of tiles,
a player may either remove a positive number of tiles from one of the two end
stacks, or remove the same positive number of tiles from two consecutive
stacks. Whenever an interior stack is reduced to 0, the two neighboring stacks
are combined. In this paper, we prove several results about those Twyst-off
positions that can be won by the second player (these are called P-positions).
We prove an existence and uniqueness result that makes the visualization of
data on three-stack P-positions possible. This shows that many such positions
are symmetric, like the easy general examples (a,a,a) and (a,a+1,a). The main
result establishes tight bounds on those three-stack P-positions that are not
symmetric. We go on to prove one general structural result for positions with
an arbitrary number of stacks. We also prove facts about the game when allowing
stacks of infinite size, including classifying all positions with only infinite
stacks in sequences of up to six stacks.

between two distant parties. Although the significance of QKD is undisputed,
its feasibility has been questioned because of certain limitations in the
practical application of real-life QKD systems. It is a common belief the lack
of perfect single-photon source and the existence of detection loss will
handicap the feasibility of QKD by creating security loopholes and distance
limitations. The measurement device independent QKD (MDIQKD) with decoy-state
method removes the security threats from both the imperfect single-photon
source and the detection loss. Lengthening the distance and improving the key
rate of QKD with such a superior method is thus the central issue in the
practical application of QKD. Here, we report the results of MDIQKD over 404 km
of ultralow-loss optical fibre and 311 km of standard optical fibre by
employing an optimized four-intensity decoy-state method. This record-breaking
implementation of MDIQKD method not only provides a new distance record for
both MDIQKD and all types of QKD systems, more significantly, it achieves a
distance that the traditional BB84 QKD would not be able to achieve with the
same detection devices even with ideal single-phone sources. For the first
time, our work demonstrates that with the MDIQKD method, imperfect devices can
achieve better results than what ideal sources could have achieved. This work
represents a significant step towards proving and developing a feasible
long-distance QKD.

of mixture components and identify cluster-relevant variables simultaneously as
well as to obtain an identified model. Our approach consists in specifying
sparse hierarchical priors on the mixture weights and component means. In a
deliberately overfitting mixture model the sparse prior on the weights empties
superfluous components during MCMC. A straightforward estimator for the true
number of components is given by the most frequent number of non-empty
components visited during MCMC sampling. Specifying a shrinkage prior, namely
the normal gamma prior, on the component means leads to improved parameter
estimates as well as identification of cluster-relevant variables. After
estimating the mixture model using MCMC methods based on data augmentation and
Gibbs sampling, an identified model is obtained by relabeling the MCMC output
in the point process representation of the draws. This is performed using
$K$-centroids cluster analysis based on the Mahalanobis distance. We evaluate
our proposed strategy in a simulation setup with artificial data and by
applying it to benchmark data sets.

will have numerous advantages over simple quantum annealing. By using such
searches the effect of problem mis-specification can be reduced, as only energy
differences between the searched states will be relevant. The quantum annealing
algorithm is an analogue of simulated annealing, a classical numerical
technique which has now been superseded. Hence, I explore two strategies to use
an annealer in a way which takes advantage of modern classical optimization
algorithms. Specifically, I show how sequential calls to quantum annealers can
be used to construct analogues of population annealing and parallel tempering
which use quantum searches as subroutines. The techniques given here can be
applied not only to optimization, but also to sampling. I examine the
feasibility of these protocols on real devices and note that implementing such
protocols should require minimal if any change to the current design of the
flux qubit-based annealers by D-Wave Systems Inc. I further provide
proof-of-principle numerical experiments based on quantum Monte Carlo that

hopping mediated by the edge-sharing oxygens is accessible. This is due to the
formation of isolated quasimolecular orbitals (QMOs) in each hexagon,
introduced recently by Mazin et al. [Phys. Rev. Lett. 109, 197201 (2012)],
which stabilizes a band insulating phase for $t_{2g}^5$ systems. However, with
help of the exact diagonalization method to treat the electron kinetics and
correlations on an equal footing, we find that the QMOs are fragile against not
only the spin-orbit coupling (SOC) but also the Coulomb repulsion. We show that
the electronic phase of $t_{2g}^5$ systems can vary from a quasimolecular band
insulator to a relativistic $J_{\rm eff}=1/2$ Mott insulator with increasing
the SOC as well as the Coulomb repulsion. The different electronic phases
manifest themselves in electronic excitations observed in optical conductivity
and resonant inelastic x-ray scattering. Based on our calculations, we assert
that the currently known Ru$^{3+}$- and Ir$^{4+}$-based honeycomb systems are
far from the quasimolecular band insulator but rather the relativistic Mott
insulator.

combinatorial auctions, where buyers' complex preferences over goods would
naturally extend beyond the items obtained in the Walrasian equilibrium.
  We study Walrasian equilibria in combinatorial auctions when quasilinearity
is not assumed. We show that existence can be reduced to an Arrow-Debreu style
market with one divisible good and many indivisible goods, and that a
""fractional"" Walrasian equilibrium always exists. We also show that standard
integral Walrasian equilibria are related to integral solutions of an induced
configuration LP associated with a fractional Walrasian equilibrium,
generalizing known results for both quasilinear and non-quasilnear settings.

in multiferroic materials provide extra degrees of freedom for creating
next-generation memory devices. A variety of concepts of multiferroic or
magnetoelectric memories have been proposed and explored in the past decade.
Here we propose a new principle to realize a multilevel nonvolatile memory
based on the multiple states of the magnetoelectric coefficient ({\alpha}) of
multiferroics. Because the states of {\alpha} depends on the relative
orientation between magnetization and polarization, one can reach different
levels of {\alpha} by controlling the ratio of up and down ferroelectric
domains with external electric fields. Our experiments in a device made of the
PMN-PT/Terfenol-D multiferroic heterostructure confirm that the states of
{\alpha} can be well controlled between positive and negative by applying
selective electric fields. Consequently, two-level, four-level, and eight-level
nonvolatile memory devices are demonstrated at room temperature. This kind of
multilevel magnetoelectric memory retains all the advantages of ferroelectric
random access memory but overcomes the drawback of destructive reading of
polarization. In contrast, the reading of {\alpha} is nondestructive and highly
efficient in a parallel way, with an independent reading coil shared by all the
memory cells.

helicity is a meaningful measure of how magnetic helicity is distributed within

magnetic flux linking with that field line. Using magneto-frictional

solar surface. On open magnetic field lines, the helicity injected by the Sun
is largely output to the solar wind, provided that the coronal relaxation is
sufficiently fast. But on closed magnetic field lines, helicity is able to
build up. We find that the field line helicity is non-uniformly distributed,
and is highly concentrated in twisted magnetic flux ropes. Eruption of these
flux ropes is shown to lead to sudden bursts of helicity output, in contrast to
the steady flux along the open magnetic field lines.

(PEPs). Due to the bosonic character of these quasi particles, exciton
polariton condensation can lead to laser-like emission at much lower threshold
powers than in conventional photon lasers. Here, we observe PEP lasing through
a dark plasmonic mode in an array of metallic nanoparticles with a low
threshold in an optically pumped organic system. Interestingly, the threshold
power of the lasing is reduced by increasing the degree of light matter
coupling in spite of the degradation of the quantum efficiency of the active
material, highlighting the ultrafast dynamic responsible for the lasing, i.e.,
stimulated scattering. These results demonstrate a unique roomtemperature
platform for exploring the physics of exciton polaritons in an open cavity
architecture and pave the road toward the integration of this on-chip lasing
device with the current photonics and active metamaterial planar technologies.

dynamics (MD) simulations. To describe the intermolecular interaction between
water and silica atoms, two types of interaction potential models are used: the
standard Br\'odka and Zerda (BZ) model, and the Gulmen and Thompson (GT) model.
We perform an in-depth analysis of the influence of the choice of the potential
on the arrangement of the water molecules in partially filled pores and on top
of silica slabs. We find that at moderate pore filling ratios, the GT silica
surface is completely wetted by water molecules, which agrees well with
experimental findings, while the commonly used BZ surface is less hydrophilic
and is only partially wetted. We interpret our simulation results using an
analytical calculation of the phase diagram of water in partially filled pores.
Moreover, an evaluation of the contact angle of the water droplet on top of the
silica slab reveals that the interaction becomes more hydrophilic with
increasing slab thickness and saturates around 2.5-3 nm, in agreement with the
experimentally found value. Our analysis also shows that the hydroaffinity of
the surface is mainly determined by the electrostatic interaction, but that the
van der Waals interaction nevertheless is strong enough that it can turn a
hydrophobic surface into a hydrophilic surface.

paper-and-pencil proof methods and computer based simulation tools but their
results cannot be trusted due to their inherent inaccuracy limitations. The
recent developments in probabilistic analysis support using formal methods have

the complementary strengths of mainstream formal methods, like theorem proving

an irreducible representation of G=SLn(C) are various polytopes whose integral
points parameterize a basis for the representation, e.g. the Gelfand-Zetlin
polytope. Such polytopes can be constructed via the theory of geometric
crystals by tropicalising a certain function, and in fact, the function
involved coincides with the superpotential from the Landau-Ginzburg model for
G/B coming from mirror symmetry. In mirror symmetry a special role is played by
the critical points of the superpotential, and motivated by this, we give a
definition of the tropical critical points and use it to find a canonical point
in each polytope. We then characterize the highest weights for which this
tropical critical point is integral and therefore corresponds to a basis vector
of the corresponding representation. Finally we give an interpretation of the
tropical critical point by constructing a special vector in the representation
using Borel-Weil theory and conjecturing a correspondence between this vector

modifications of the $R^2$ gravity theory. As such, it is possible to construct
exact non-homogeneous and locally anisotropic cosmological solutions for

making. However, under general forms of state uncertainty as considered in the
Partially Observable Stochastic Game (POSG), such decision making problems are
still not very well understood. This paper makes a contribution to the theory
of zero-sum POSGs by characterizing structure in their value function. In
particular, we introduce a new formulation of the value function for zs-POSGs
as a function of the ""plan-time sufficient statistics"" (roughly speaking the
information distribution in the POSG), which has the potential to enable
generalization over such information distributions. We further delineate this
generalization capability by proving a structural result on the shape of value
function: it exhibits concavity and convexity with respect to appropriately
chosen marginals of the statistic space. This result is a key pre-cursor for
developing solution methods that may be able to exploit such structure.
Finally, we show how these results allow us to reduce a zs-POSG to a
""centralized"" model with shared observations, thereby transferring results for
the latter, narrower class, to games with individual (private) observations.

Under the assumption that each population in the network is large, the activity

approximated by a continuum. In this article we make the two approximation
steps explicit. Extending a model by Bressloff and Newby, we describe the

analyze the fluctuations of this Markov chain and set up an approximating

and hole waves by virtue of the so- called crossed Andreev reflection (CAR).
The CAR process which is equivalent to the Cooper pair splitting into the two N
electrodes provides a unique possibility of constructing entangled electrons in
solid state systems. When electrons are locally injected from an N lead, due to
the CAR and normal reflection of quasiparticles by the insulating barriers at
the interfaces, sequences of electron and hole focuses are established inside
another N electrode. This behavior originates from the change of momentum
during electron-hole conversion beside the successive normal reflections of
electrons and holes due to the barriers. The focusing phenomena studied here is
fundamentally different from the electron focusing in other systems like
graphene pn junctions. In particular due to the electron-hole symmetry of
superconducting state, the focusing of electrons and holes are robust against
thermal excitations. Furthermore the effect of superconducting layer width, the
injection point position, and barriers strength is investigated on the focusing
behavior of the junction. Very intriguingly, it is shown that by varying the
barriers strength, one can separately control the density of electrons or holes
at the focuses.

Rays (CR). Within this framework, particles are accelerated at supernova
remnant shocks and then released in the interstellar medium. The mechanism
through which CRs are released and the way in which they propagate still remain
open issues. The main difficulty is the high non-linearity of the problem: CRs
themselves excite the magnetic turbulence that confines them close to their
sources. We solve numerically the coupled differential equations describing the
evolution in space and time of the escaping particles and of the waves
generated through the CR streaming instability. The warm ionized and warm
neutral phases of the interstellar medium are considered. These phases occupy
the largest fraction of the disc volume, where most supernovae explode, and are
characterised by the significant presence of neutral particles. The friction
between those neutrals and ions results in a very effective wave damping
mechanism. It is found that streaming instability affects the propagation of
CRs even in the presence of ion-neutral friction. The diffusion coefficient can
be suppressed by more than a factor of $\sim 2$ over a region of few tens of pc
around the remnant. The suppression increases for smaller distances. The
propagation of $\approx 10$ GeV particles is affected for several tens of
kiloyears after escape, while $\approx 1$ TeV particles are affected for few
kiloyears. This might have a great impact on the interpretation of gamma-ray
observations of molecular clouds located in the vicinity of supernova remnants.

they are plotted as a function of rapidity ($y$) shifted by the beam rapidity

fragmentation (LF) is a well studied phenomenon as observed in various
collision energies and colliding systems experimentally. It is very interesting
to verify this phenomenon theoretically. We study such a phenomenon for pion
rapidity spectra using our hydrodynamic-like model where the collective flow is
incorporated in a thermal model in the longitudinal direction. Our findings
advocate the observation of extended longitudinal scaling in the rapidity

violated at top RHIC and LHC energies. Prediction of LF hypothesis for Pb+Pb

states which notably contains all the eigenstates of the model. As usual for
models solved by SoV, these scalar products can be expressed as some
determinants with a non-trivial dependance in terms of the inhomogeneity
parameters that have to be introduced for the method to be applicable. We show
that these determinants can be transformed into alternative ones in which the
homogeneous limit can easily be taken. These new representations can be
considered as generalizations of the well-known determinant representation for
the scalar products of the Bethe states of the periodic chain. In the
particular case where a constraint is applied on the boundary parameters, such
that the transfer matrix spectrum and eigenstates can be characterized in terms
of polynomial solutions of a usual T-Q equation, the scalar product that we
compute here corresponds to the scalar product between two off-shell Bethe-type
states. If in addition one of the states is an eigenstate, the determinant
representation can be simplified, hence leading in this boundary case to direct
analogues of algebraic Bethe ansatz determinant representations of the scalar
products for the periodic chain.

namely, primary channel gain, is crucial for a cognitive transmitter (CT) to
control the transmit power and achieve spectrum sharing. Conventionally, the
primary channel gain is estimated in the primary system and thus unavailable at
the CT. To deal with this issue, two estimators are proposed by enabling the CT
to sense primary signals. In particular, by adopting the maximum likelihood
(ML) criterion to analyze the received primary signals, a ML estimator is first
developed. After demonstrating the high computational complexity of the ML
estimator, a median based (MB) estimator with proved low complexity is then
proposed. Furthermore, the estimation accuracy of the MB estimation is
theoretically characterized. By comparing the ML estimator and the MB estimator
from the aspects of the computational complexity as well as the estimation
accuracy, both advantages and disadvantages of two estimators are revealed.
Numerical results show that the estimation errors of the ML estimator and the
MB estimator can be as small as $0.6$ dB and $0.7$ dB, respectively.

towards arbitrary hiring durations.
  Our algorithmic approach is a relaxation that aggregates all temporal
constraints into a non-temporal constraint. Then we apply a linear scaling
algorithm that, on every arrival, computes a tentative solution on the input
that is known up to this point. This tentative solution uses the non-temporal,
relaxed constraints scaled down linearly by the amount of time that has already
passed.

in RR Lyrae stars. In four, long-period ($P>0.6$ d) stars observed by the
Optical Gravitational Lensing Experiment, and classified as fundamental mode
pulsators (RRab), we detect additional, low-amplitude variability, with period
shorter than fundamental mode period. The period ratios fall in a range similar
to double-mode fundamental and first overtone RR Lyrae stars (RRd), with the
exception of one star, in which the period ratio is significantly lower and
nearly exactly equals 0.7. Although period ratios are fairly different for the
four stars, the light curve shapes corresponding to the dominant, fundamental
mode are very similar. The peak-to-peak amplitudes and amplitude ratios
(Fourier parameters $R_{21}$ and $R_{31}$) are among the highest observed in
RRab stars of similar period, while Fourier phases ($\varphi_{21}$ and
$\varphi_{31}$) are among the lowest observed in RRab stars.
  If the additional variability is interpreted as due to radial first overtone,
then, the four stars are the most extreme RRd variables of the longest
pulsation periods known. Indeed, the observed period ratios can be well
modelled with high metallicity pulsation models. However, at such long
pulsation periods, first overtone is typically damped.
  Five other candidates, with weak signature of additional variability, sharing
the same characteristics, were also detected and are briefly discussed.

coupled amplitude equations to study the competitive behavior between two

confirm the existence of stationary patterns with larger amplitudes when the

near-infrared microlensing rate and optical depth for simulated stellar
catalogues which are signal-to-noise limited, and take account of extinction,
unresolved stellar background light and finite source size effects, which can
be significant for FFPs. We find that the global ground-based I-band yield over
a central 200 deg^2 region covering the Galactic centre ranges from 20
Earth-mass FFPs year^-1 up to 3,500 year^-1 for Jupiter FFPs in the limit of
100% detection efficiency, and almost an order of magnitude larger for a K-band
survey. For ground-based surveys we find that the inclusion of finite source
and the unresolved background reveals a mass-dependent variation in the spatial
distribution of FFPs. For a space-based H-band covering 2 deg^2, the yield
depends on the target field but maximizes close to the Galactic centre with
around 76 Earth through to 1,700 Jupiter FFPs year^-1. For near-IR space-based
surveys the spatial distribution of FFPs is found to be largely insensitive to
the FFP mass scale.

Decayed Commodity Money (DCM) for the store of value across time and space.
Considering the logistics cost of commodity warehousing by the third financial
institution such as London Metal Exchange, we can award the difference between
the original and the residual value of the anchor to the financial institution.
This type of currency has the characteristic of self-decaying value over time.
Therefore DCM has the advantages of both the commodity money which has the
function of preserving wealth and credit currency without the logistics cost.
In addition, DCM can also avoid the defects that precious metal money is
hoarded by market and credit currency often leads to excessive liquidity. DCM
is also different from virtual currency, such as bitcoin, which does not have a
corresponding commodity anchor. As a conclusion, DCM can provide a new way of
storing wealth for nations, corporations and individuals effectively.

to ground truth transcriptions). Very high word error rates are reported---in
the order of 70--80% for speaker-dependent and 80--95% for speaker-independent

cluster quality and word segmentation metrics, we show that by imposing a
consistent top-down segmentation while also using bottom-up knowledge from
detected syllable boundaries, both single-speaker and multi-speaker versions of

between the theoretical abundance predicted for primordial $^7$Li assuming
standard nucleosynthesis and the value inferred from astrophysical
measurements, can be solved through a non-thermal BBN mechanism has been
investigated by several authors. In particular, it has been shown that the
decay of a MeV-mass particle, like, e.g., a sterile neutrino, decaying after
BBN not only solves the lithium problem, but also satisfies cosmological and
laboratory bounds, making such a scenario worth to be investigated in further
detail. In this paper, we constrain the parameters of the model with the
combination of current data, including Planck 2015 measurements of temperature
and polarization anisotropies of the CMB, FIRAS limits on spectral distortions,
astrophysical measurements of primordial abundances and laboratory constraints.
We find that a sterile neutrino with mass $M_S=4.35_{-0.17}^{+0.13}\,MeV$ (at
$95\%$ c.l.), a decay time $\tau_S=1.8_{-1.3}^{+2.5}\cdot 10^5\,s$ (at $95\%$
c.l.) and an initial density $\bar{n}_S/\bar{n}_{cmb}=1.7_{-0.6}^{+3.5}\cdot
10^{-4}$ (at $95\%$ c.l.) in units of the number density of CMB photons,
perfectly accounts for the difference between predicted and observed $^7$Li
primordial abundance. This model also predicts an increase of the effective
number of relativistic degrees of freedom at the time of CMB decoupling $\Delta
N_{eff}^{cmb}\equiv N_{eff}^{cmb}-3.046=0.34_{-0.14}^{+0.16}$ at $95\%$ c.l..
The required abundance of sterile neutrinos is incompatible with the standard
thermal history of the Universe, but could be realized in a low reheating
temperature scenario. We provide forecasts for future experiments finding that
the combination of measurements from the COrE+ and PIXIE missions will allow to
significantly reduce the permitted region for the sterile lifetime and density.

difficult. To implement MHD requires two steps: a modification to the momentum
equation and an induction equation, and both present challenges. We first
provide an overview of how SPMHD is implemented, and then discuss how this
implementation fails and the limitation of various corrective methods - with
particular reference to the effects of particle disorder. Although there are
many problems for which, with careful choice of corrective measures, good
results can be obtained, we then show that, at the very limits of the state of
the art, the ability to perform stable MHD calculations in SPH is curtailed by
numerical issues.

and property damage. Therefore, preventing such outcomes to the extent possible
is a key concern, and the scientific community faces an increasing demand for
regularly updated appraisals of evolving climate conditions and extreme
weather. NOAA's Storm Events Database is undoubtedly an invaluable resource to
the general public, to the professional, and to the researcher. Due to such
importance, the primary objective of this study was to explore this database
and get clues about its reliability. A complete investigation of the damage
estimates, injuries or fatalities figures is unfeasible due to the extension of
the database. However, an exploratory data analysis with the resources of the R
statistical data analysis language found that damage reports are missing in
more than half of the records, that part of the damage values are incorrect,
and that, despite all efforts of standardizations, non-standard event type
names are still finding their way into the database. These few results are
enough to demonstrate that the database suffers from incompleteness and
inconsistencies and should not be used without taking reservations and
appropriate precautions before advancing any inferences from the data.

structures from residual dipolar couplings (RDC) or chemical shift
anisotropies. Assuming a given template structure, the singular value
decomposition (SVD) method proposed in Losonczi et al. 1999 has been used
traditionally to estimate the Saupe tensor. Despite its simplicity, whenever
the template structure has large structural noise, the eigenvalues of the
estimated tensor have a magnitude systematically smaller than their actual
values. This leads to systematic error when calculating the eigenvalue
dependent parameters, magnitude and rhombicity. We propose here a Monte Carlo
simulation method to remove such bias. We further demonstrate the effectiveness
of our method in the setting when the eigenvalue estimates from multiple
template protein fragments are available and their average is used as an
improved eigenvalue estimator. For both synthetic and experimental RDC datasets

magnitude of our proposed bias-reduced estimator generally reaches at least 90%

human-machine interfaces have become increasingly complex in both form and
function, control remains challenging for users. This has resulted in an
increasing gap between user control approaches and the number of robotic motors
which can be controlled. One way to address this gap is to shift some autonomy
to the robot. Semi-autonomous actions of the robotic agent can then be shaped
by human feedback, simplifying user control. Most prior work on agent shaping
by humans has incorporated training with feedback, or has included indirect
control signals. By contrast, in this paper we explore how a human can provide
concurrent feedback signals and real-time myoelectric control signals to train
a robot's actor-critic reinforcement learning control system. Using both a
physical and a simulated robotic system, we compare training performance on a
simple movement task when reward is derived from the environment, when reward
is provided by the human, and combinations of these two approaches. Our results
indicate that some benefit can be gained with the inclusion of human generated
feedback.

carrier mobility, and reduce minority carrier lifetime thus limiting their
utility in devices. Native defects are responsible in many cases, but extrinsic
dopants may also act as their own compensation when occupying an alternate
lattice site. Suppressing the concentrations of compensating defects during
processing close to thermal equilibrium is difficult because formation
enthalpies are lowered as the Fermi level moves towards the majority band edge.
Excess carriers, introduced for example by photogeneration, modify the
formation enthalpy of semiconductor defects and thus can be harnessed during
crystal growth or annealing to suppress such defect populations. Herein we
develop a rigorous and general model for defect formation in the presence of
steady-state excess carrier concentrations by combining the standard
quasi-chemical formalism with a detailed-balance description that is applicable
for any defect state in the bandgap. Considering the quasi-Fermi levels as
chemical potentials, we demonstrate that increasing the minority carrier
concentration increases the formation enthalpy for typical compensating
centers, thus suppressing their formation. This effect is illustrated for the
specific example of native GaSb antisite acceptors in nominally un-doped and
extrinsically n-type doped GaSb. The model also predicts reductions in the
concentration of ionized scattering centers as well as increased mobility.
While our treatment is generalized for excess carrier injection or generation
in semiconductors by any means, we provide a set of guidelines for applying the
concept in photoassisted physical vapor deposition.

the cosmological energy density in the form of radiation, usually expressed in
terms of the effective number of neutrinos, N_eff. We find a value of
N_eff=3.045, in agreement with previous theoretical calculations and consistent
with the latest analysis of Planck data. This result does not depend on the

spatial scales, so they ought to be supplemented with more conventional
renormalization-group (RG) techniques to account for large scale correlations.
To fulfil this goal a ""layer-cake"" renormalization scheme earlier developed for
rotationally symmetric Hamiltonians has been generalized to the lattice case.
The RG technique can be naturally integrated with an appropriately modified
cluster method so that the RG equations were used only in the presence of large
scale fluctuations, while in their absence the approach reduced to a
conventional cluster method. As an illustrative example the simplest
single-site cluster approximation together with the local-potential RG equation
are applied to simple cubic Ising model to calculate several non-universal

straightforward extensions to other classes of kernel functions and
distributions. The analysis also offers a guide on when to use higher order
kernels in distribution function estimation.
  A simple plug-in method of simultaneously selecting the optimal bandwidth and
kernel order is proposed based on a non-asymptotic approximation of the unknown
distribution by a normal mixture. A simulation study shows that the method
works well in finite samples, thus providing a viable alternative to existing
bandwidth selection procedures.

that for all cases, the shadow becomes smaller with increasing electric charge.
Also, by increasing the rotation parameters, circular symmetry of the image of

divergent terms appear in the series solution. An example of this was presented

their results is that the evolution operator has no well-defined limit for
adiabatic switching. We will rework this problem to show that for adiabatic
switching the evolved states are well-defined with any divergences being
absorbed in a time independent phase factor which can be removed. These results

quantum entanglement, Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen steering, and Bell's nonlocality.
Among which, Bell's nonlocality is the strongest type. Bell's nonlocality for
quantum states is usually detected by violation of some Bell's inequalities,
such as Clause-Horne-Shimony-Holt inequality for two qubits. Steering is a
manifestation of nonlocality intermediate between entanglement and Bell's
nonlocality. This peculiar feature has led to a curious quantum phenomenon, the
one-way Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen steering. The one-way steering was an important
open question presented in 2007, and positively answered in 2014 by Bowles
\emph{et al.}, who presented a simple class of one-way steerable states in a
two-qubit system with at least thirteen projective measurements. The inspiring
result for the first time theoretically confirms quantum nonlocality can be
fundamentally asymmetric. Here, we propose another curious quantum phenomenon:
Bell nonlocal states can be constructed from some steerable states. This novel
finding not only offers a distinctive way to study Bell's nonlocality without
Bell's inequality but with steering inequality, but also may avoid locality
loophole in Bell's tests and make Bell's nonlocality easier for demonstration.
Furthermore, a nine-setting steering inequality has also been presented for
developing more efficient one-way steering and detecting some Bell nonlocal
states.

fields (CKVFs) of locally rotationally symmetric (LRS) Bianchi type V

results with those of general relativity. The general solution of teleparallel
conformal Killing's equations is found in terms of some unknown functions of t

conditions are solved in some particular cases to get the final form of
teleparallel CKVFs. It is observed that the LRS Bianchi type V spacetimes admit
proper teleparallel CKVF in only one case, while in remaining cases the
teleparallel CKVFs reduce to teleparallel Killing vector fields (KVFs).
Moreover, it is shown that the LRS Bianchi type V spacetimes do not admit any

science and industry. However, such problems are intractable on digital
computers based on the von Neumann architecture, thus creating the need for
alternative solutions to tackle such problems. Recently, a deterministic,
continuous-time dynamical system (CTDS) was proposed (Nat.Phys. {\bf 7}(12),
966 (2011)) to solve a representative NP-complete problem, Boolean
Satisfiability (SAT). This solver shows polynomial analog time-complexity on
even the hardest benchmark $k$-SAT ($k \geq 3$) formulas, but at an energy cost
through exponentially driven auxiliary variables. This paper presents a novel
analog hardware SAT solver, AC-SAT, implementing the CTDS via incorporating
novel, analog circuit design ideas. AC-SAT is intended to be used as a
co-processor and is programmable for handling different problem specifications.
It is especially effective for solving hard $k$-SAT problem instances that are
challenging for algorithms running on digital machines. Furthermore, with its
modular design, AC-SAT can readily be extended to solve larger size problems,
while the size of the circuit grows linearly with the product of the number of
variables and number of clauses. The circuit is designed and simulated based on
a 32nm CMOS technology. SPICE simulation results show speedup factors of
$\sim$10$^4$ on even the hardest 3-SAT problems, when compared with a
state-of-the-art SAT solver on digital computers. As an example, for hard
problems with $N=50$ variables and $M=212$ clauses, solutions are found within
from a few $ns$ to a few hundred $ns$.

that are difficult to be completely described using classical continuum models.
The aim of this paper is to show how the introduction of energy terms related
to the micro-deformation mechanisms of the fabric, in particular to the bending
stiffness of the yarns, helps in the modeling of the mechanical behavior of
this kind of materials. To this aim, a second gradient, hyperelastic, initially
orthotropic continuum theory is proposed to model fibrous composite interlocks
at finite strains. In particular, the present work explores the relationship
between the onset of wrinkling appearing during the simulation of the deep
drawing of a woven fabric and the use of a second gradient model. It is shown
that the introduction of second gradient terms accounting for the description
of in-plane and out-of-plane bending rigidities, decreases the onset of
wrinkles during the simulation of deep-drawing.
  In this work, a quadratic energy, roughly proportional to the square of the
curvature of the fibers, is presented and implemented in the simulations. This
simple constitutive assumption allows to clearly show the effects of the second
gradient energy on both the wrinkling description and the numerical stability
of the model. The results obtained in second gradient simulations are
descriptive of the experimental evidence of deep drawing whose description is
targeted in this work. The present paper provides additional evidence of the
fact that first gradient continuum theories alone cannot be considered fully
descriptive of the behavior of dry woven composite reinforcements. On the other
hand, the proposed second gradient model for fibrous composite reinforcements
opens the way both to the more accurate simulation of complex forming processes
and to the possibility of controlling the onset of wrinkles.
