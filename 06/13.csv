  Using Rao-Blackwellized Particle Filters","7 pages, 7 figures, IEEE ITSC",,,,"cs.RO cs.SY","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  An essential function for automated vehicle technologies is accurate
localization. It is difficult, however, to achieve lane-level accuracy with
low-cost Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) receivers due to the biased
noisy pseudo-range measurements. Approaches such as Differential GNSS can
improve the accuracy, but usually require an enormous amount of investment in
base stations. The emerging connected vehicle technologies provide an
alternative approach to improving the localization accuracy. It has been shown
in this paper that localization accuracy can be enhanced by fusing GNSS
information within a group of connected vehicles and matching the configuration
of the group to a digital map to eliminate the common bias in localization. A
Rao-Blackwellized particle filter (RBPF) was used to jointly estimate the
common biases of the pseudo-ranges and the vehicles positions. Multipath
biases, which are non-common to vehicles, were mitigated by a multi-hypothesis
detection-rejection approach. The temporal correlation was exploited through
the prediction-update process. The proposed approach was compared to the
existing static and smoothed static methods in the intersection scenario.
Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm reduced the estimation
error by fifty percent and reduced the estimation variance by two orders of
magnitude.

of quantum and statistical physics, and inherent to such phenomena as thermal
radiation and van der Waals forces. While the basic principles are the material
of elementary texts, recent experimental and technological advances have made
it necessary to come to terms with counterintuitive consequences of
electromagnetic fluctuations at short scales -- in the so called {\it
near-field} regime. We focus on three manifestations of such behavior: {\bf
(i)} The Stefan--Boltzmann law describes thermal radiation from macroscopic
bodies, but fails to account for magnitude, polarization and coherence of
radiation from small objects (say compared to the skin depth). {\bf (ii)} The
heat transfer between two bodies at similar close proximity is dominated by
evanescent waves, and can be several orders of magnitude larger than the
classical contribution due to propagating waves. {\bf (iii)} Casimir/van der
Waals interactions are a dominant force between objects at sub-micron
separation; the non-equilibrium analogs of this force (for objects at different
temperatures) have not been sufficiently explored (at least experimentally). To
explore these phenomena we introduce the tool of fluctuational quantum
electrodynamics (QED) originally introduced by Rytov in the 1950s. Combined
with a scattering formalism, this enables studies of heat radiation and
transfer, equilibrium and non-equilibrium forces for objects of different
material properties, shapes, separations and arrangements.

Analytical potential and field formulas are rather complicated (even in the

large rounding errors. On the other hand, Gaussian cubature, which is an
efficient numerical integration method, yields simple and fast potential and

the method is demonstrated by the physical picture: the triangles and
rectangles with their continuous charge distributions are replaced by discrete
point charges, whose simple potential and field formulas explain the higher

for the purpose of BEM computations both with CPU and GPU, and we compare its

quantity in Bayesian model selection. The Diffusive Nested Sampling algorithm,
a variant of Nested Sampling, is a powerful tool for generating posterior
samples and estimating marginal likelihoods. It is effective at solving complex
problems including many where the posterior distribution is multimodal or has
strong dependencies between variables. DNest4 is an open source (MIT licensed),
multi-threaded implementation of this algorithm in C++11, along with associated
utilities including: i) RJObject, a class template for finite mixture models,
(ii) A Python package allowing basic use without C++ coding, and iii)

with 4000\AA\ breaks consistent with an average luminosity-weighted age of 2.3
Gyr. Our photometric and IFU spectroscopic observations confirm the existence
of a population of local passive spiral galaxies, implying that transformation
into early-type morphologies is not required for the quenching of star
formation.

that can determine the total area of tissue at risk for infarction using
diagnostic magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) sequences. Typical MRI data sets
consist of T1- and T2-weighted imaging (T1WI, T2WI) along with advanced MRI
parameters of diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) and perfusion weighted imaging
(PWI) methods. Each of these parameters has distinct radiological-pathological
meaning. For example, DWI interrogates the movement of water in the tissue and
PWI gives an estimate of the blood flow, both are critical measures during the
evolution of stroke. In order to integrate these data and give an estimate of
the tissue at risk or damaged, we have developed advanced machine learning
methods based on unsupervised non-linear dimensionality reduction (NLDR)
techniques. NLDR methods are a class of algorithms that uses mathematically
defined manifolds for statistical sampling of multidimensional classes to
generate a discrimination rule of guaranteed statistical accuracy and they can
generate a two- or three-dimensional map, which represents the prominent
structures of the data and provides an embedded image of meaningful
low-dimensional structures hidden in their high-dimensional observations. In
this manuscript, we develop NLDR methods on high dimensional MRI data sets of
preclinical animals and clinical patients with stroke. On analyzing the
performance of these methods, we observed that there was a high of similarity
between multiparametric embedded images from NLDR methods and the ADC map and
perfusion map. It was also observed that embedded scattergram of abnormal
(infarcted or at risk) tissue can be visualized and provides a mechanism for
automatic methods to delineate potential stroke volumes and early tissue at
risk.

empirical risk and the risk of the unknown and ensures that the region of the
feature space in which a test sample would be classified as known (one of the
known classes) is always bounded, ensuring a finite risk of the unknown. In
this work, we also highlight the properties of the SVM classifier related to
the open-set scenario, and provide necessary and sufficient conditions for an
RBF SVM to have bounded open-space risk.

massive data. While posing new challenges to effective learning, it can play a
crucial role in powering meaningful scientific discoveries through the
understanding of important differences among subpopulations of interest. In
this paper, we exploit multiple networks with Gaussian graphs to encode the
connectivity patterns of a large number of features on the subpopulations. To
uncover the heterogeneity of these structures across subpopulations, we suggest
a new framework of tuning-free heterogeneity pursuit (THP) via large-scale
inference, where the number of networks is allowed to diverge. In particular,
two new tests, the chi-based test and the linear functional-based test, are
introduced and their asymptotic null distributions are established. Under mild
regularity conditions, we establish that both tests are optimal in achieving
the testable region boundary and the sample size requirement for the latter
test is minimal. Both theoretical guarantees and the tuning-free feature stem
from efficient multiple-network estimation by our newly suggested approach of
heterogeneous group square-root Lasso (HGSL) for high-dimensional
multi-response regression with heterogeneous noises. To solve this convex
program, we further introduce a tuning-free algorithm that is scalable and
enjoys provable convergence to the global optimum. Both computational and
theoretical advantages of our procedure are elucidated through simulation and
real data examples.

Hochschild cohomology of Thom spectra arising from $n$-fold loop maps $f: A \to

factorization homology $\int_M Th(f)$ as the Thom spectrum associated to a
certain map $\int _M A \to BO$. When $M$ is framed and $X$ is
$(n-1)$-connected, this spectrum is equivalent to a Thom spectrum of a virtual
bundle over the mapping space $Map_c(M,X)$; in general, this is a Thom spectrum
of a virtual bundle over a certain section space. This can be viewed as a
twisted form of the non-abelian Poincar\'e duality theorem of Segal, Salvatore,
and Lurie, which occurs when $f: A \to BO$ is nullhomotopic. This result also
generalizes the results of Blumberg-Cohen-Schlichtkrull on the topological
Hochschild homology of Thom spectra, and of Schlichtkrull on higher topological
Hochschild homology of Thom spectra. We use this to calculate the factorization
homology of some Thom spectra, including the classical cobordism spectra,
spectra arising from systems of groups, and the Eilenberg-MacLane spectra $H
\mathbb{Z}/p$, $H\mathbb{Z}_{(p)}$, and $H\mathbb{Z}$. We build upon the
description of the factorization homology of Thom spectra to study the ($n=1$
and higher) topological Hochschild cohomology of Thom spectra, which enables
calculations and a description in terms of sections of a parametrized spectrum.
If $X$ is a closed manifold, Atiyah duality for parametrized spectra allows us
to deduce a duality between $E_n$ topological Hochschild homology and $E_n$
topological Hochschild cohomology, recovering string topology operations when
$f$ is nullhomotopic. In conjunction with the higher Deligne conjecture, this
gives $E_{n+1}$ structures on a certain family of Thom spectra, which were not
previously known to be ring spectra.

unnecessarily place restrictions over inheritance' have rippled as mantras
through the PL research community for years. Many mainstream OO developers and
OO language designers however do not accept these statements. In
\emph{nominally-typed} OO languages that these developers and language
designers are dearly familiar with, inheritance simply is subtyping; and they
believe OO type inheritance is an inherently nominal notion not a structural
one.
  Nominally-typed OO languages are among the most used programming languages
today. However, the value of nominal typing to mainstream OO developers, as a
means for designing robust OO software, seems to be in wait for full
appreciation among PL researchers--thereby perpetuating an unnecessary schism
between many OO developers and language designers and many OO PL researchers,
with each side discounting, if not even disregarding, the views of the other.
  In this essay we strengthen earlier efforts to demonstrate the semantic value
of nominal typing by presenting a technical comparison between nominal OO type
systems and structural OO type systems. Recently, a domain-theoretic model of
nominally-typed OOP was compared to well-known models of structurally-typed
OOP. Combined, these comparisons provide a clear and deep account for the
relation between nominal and structural OO type systems that has not been
presented before, and they help demonstrate the key value of nominal typing and
nominal subtyping to OO developers and language designers.
  We believe a clearer understanding of the key semantic advantage of pure
nominal OO typing over pure structural OO typing can help remedy the existing
schism. We believe future foundational OO PL research, to further its relevance
to mainstream OOP, should be based less on structural models of OOP and more on
nominal ones instead.

assuming that the flux structure does not change significantly over the

comparing the horizontal and vertical motions of an emerging active region. The
two motions would be correlated if the emerging structure is rigid. The
selected active region (AR) NOAA 11645 is not embedded in detectable
preexisting magnetic field. The observed horizontal motion is quantified by the
separation of the two AR polarities and the extension of the region. The
vertical motion is derived from the magnetic buoyancy theory. Our results show
that the separation of the polarities is fastest at the beginning with a
velocity of $\approx$~4~Mm hr$^{-1}$ and decreases to $\le$~1~Mm hr$^{-1}$
after the main growing phase of flux emergence. The derived thick flux-tube
buoyant velocity is between 1 and 3~Mm hr$^{-1}$ while the thin flux-tube
approximation results in an unreasonably high buoyant velocity, consistent with
the expectation that the approximation is inappropriate at the surface layer.
The observed horizontal motion is not found to directly correlate with either
the magnetic field strength or the derived buoyant velocities. However, the
percentage of the horizontally oriented fields and the temporal derivatives of
the field strength and the buoyant velocity show some positive correlations
with the separation velocity. The results of this study imply that the
assumption that the emerging active region is the cross section of a rising
flux tube whose structure can be considered rigid as it rises through the
near-surface layer should be taken with caution.

studying neural codes, dynamics and circuits. In machine learning, however,
artificial neural networks tend to eschew precisely designed codes, dynamics or
circuits in favor of brute force optimization of a cost function, often using
simple and relatively uniform initial architectures. Two recent developments
have emerged within machine learning that create an opportunity to connect
these seemingly divergent perspectives. First, structured architectures are
used, including dedicated systems for attention, recursion and various forms of
short- and long-term memory storage. Second, cost functions and training
procedures have become more complex and are varied across layers and over time.
Here we think about the brain in terms of these ideas. We hypothesize that (1)
the brain optimizes cost functions, (2) these cost functions are diverse and
differ across brain locations and over development, and (3) optimization
operates within a pre-structured architecture matched to the computational
problems posed by behavior. Such a heterogeneously optimized system, enabled by
a series of interacting cost functions, serves to make learning data-efficient
and precisely targeted to the needs of the organism. We suggest directions by
which neuroscience could seek to refine and test these hypotheses.

covariance matrix estimation. For high dimensional data, many regularized
estimators are proposed under structural assumptions on the true covariance
matrix including sparsity. They are shown to be asymptotically consistent and
rate-optimal in estimating the true covariance matrix and its structure.
However, many of them do not take into account the PDness of the estimator and
produce a non-PD estimate. To achieve the PDness, researchers consider
additional regularizations (or constraints) on eigenvalues, which make both the
asymptotic analysis and computation much harder. In this paper, we propose a
simple modification of the regularized covariance matrix estimator to make it
PD while preserving the support. We revisit the idea of linear shrinkage and
propose to take a convex combination between the first-stage estimator (the
regularized covariance matrix without PDness) and a given form of diagonal
matrix. The proposed modification, which we denote as FSPD (Fixed Support and
Positive Definiteness) estimator, is shown to preserve the asymptotic
properties of the first-stage estimator, if the shrinkage parameters are
carefully selected. It has a closed form expression and its computation is
optimization-free, unlike existing PD sparse estimators. In addition, the FSPD
is generic in the sense that it can be applied to any non-PD matrix including
the precision matrix. The FSPD estimator is numerically compared with other
sparse PD estimators to understand its finite sample properties as well as its
computational gain. It is also applied to two multivariate procedures relying
on the covariance matrix estimator -- the linear minimax classification problem

substantially improve the performance of both procedures.

converted into an SH (Seminormalized Hadamard) matrix; whose first columns are
unity vector and the rest ones are vectors with equal number of -1 and +1

play a similar role to the spins on an Ising model. The topology of the lattice

among the SH spin-vectors. Started from a randomly generated quasi H-matrix Q,
which is a matrix similar to the SH-matrix without imposing orthogonality, we
perform the SA. The transitions of Q are conducted by random exchange of {+,-}
spin-pair within the SH-spin vectors which follow the Metropolis update rule.
Upon transition toward zero-energy, the Q-matrix is evolved following a Markov
chain toward an orthogonal matrix, at which point the H-matrix is said to be
found. We demonstrate the capability of the proposed method to find some low

observations of the magnetic Herbig Ae star HD101412 to test the magnetospheric
character of its accretion disk/star interaction. We reduced and analyzed 30
spectra of HD101412, acquired with the CRIRES and X-shooter spectrographs
installed at the VLT (ESO, Chile). The spectroscopic analysis was based on the
He I lambda 10,830 and Pa gamma lines, formed in the accretion region. We found
that the temporal behavior of these diagnostic lines in the near-infrared
spectra of HD101412 can be explained by rotational modulation of line profiles
generated by accreting gas with a period P = 20.53+-1.68 d. The discovery of
this period, about half of the magnetic rotation period P_m = 42.076 d

directly converting the energy of light into electricity, and the current in
the circuit as maintained by an electrostatic potential. We propose a
thermodynamic cycle in which the gas of electrons in the p phase serves as the
working substance. The interface between the p and n phases acts as a
self-oscillating piston that modulates the absorption of heat from the photons
so that it may perform a net positive work during a complete cycle of its
motion, in accordance with the laws of thermodynamics. We draw a simple
hydrodynamical analogy between this model and the ""putt-putt""' engine of toy
boats, in which the interface between the water's liquid and gas phases serves
as the piston. We point out some testable consequences of this model.

of heavy fermions and the thermal Hall effect. Although a key to understanding
some phenomena may be the Dzyaloshinsky-Moriya (DM) interaction, its
microscopic origin is unclear. To clarify the microscopic origin, we
constructed a $t_{2g}$-orbital model with the kinetic energy, the
trigonal-distortion potential, the multiorbital Hubbard interactions, and the
$LS$ coupling, and derived the low-energy effective Hamiltonian for a $d^{1}$
Mott insulator with the weak $LS$ coupling. We first show that lack of the
inversion center of each nearest-neighbor V-V bond causes the odd-mirror
interorbital hopping integrals. Those are qualitatively different from the
even-mirror hopping integrals, existing even with the inversion center. We next
show that the second-order perturbation using the kinetic terms leads to the
ferromagnetic and the antiferromagnetic super exchange interactions. Then, we
show the most important result: the third-order perturbation terms using the
combination of the even-mirror hopping integral, the odd-mirror hopping
integral, and the $LS$ coupling causes the DM interaction due to the
mirror-mixing effect, where those hopping integrals are necessary to obtain the
antisymmetric kinetic exchange and the $LS$ coupling is necessary to excite the
orbital angular momentum at one of two sites. We also show that the magnitude
and sign of the DM interaction can be controlled by changing the positions of
the O ions and the strength of the Hubbard interactions. We discuss the
advantages in comparison with the phenomenological theory and Moriya's
microscopic theory, applicability of our mechanism, and the similarities and
differences between our case and the strong-$LS$-coupling case.

interest in many industrial and scientific applications. In this work we study
the deformation and orientation statistics of sub-Kolmogorov droplets dispersed
into a turbulent Taylor-Couette flow. Along with Direct Numerical Simulations
(DNS) of the carrier phase and Lagrangian tracking of the dispersed droplets,
we solve a phenomenological equation proposed by Maffettone and Minale
(\emph{J. Fluid Mech.} 78, 227-241 (1998)) to track the shape evolution and
orientation of approximately $10^5$ ellipsoidal droplets. By varying the
capillary number $Ca$ and viscosity ratio $\hat \mu$ of the droplets we find
that the droplets deform more with increasing capillary number $Ca$ and this
effect is more pronounced in the boundary layer regions. This indicates that
along with a capillary number effect there is also a strong correlation between
spatial position and degree of deformation of the droplet. Regardless of the
capillary number $Ca$, the major-axis of the ellipsoids tends to align with the
stream-wise direction and the extensional strain rate eigen direction in the
boundary layer region while the distribution is highly isotropic in the bulk.
When the viscosity ratio between the droplet and the carrier fluid is increased
we find that there is no preferential stretched axis which is due to the
increased influence of rotation over stretching and relaxation. Droplets in
high viscosity ratio systems are thus less deformed and oblate (disk-like) as
compared to highly deformed prolate (cigar-like) droplets in low viscosity
ratio systems.

microswimmers, by performing a comprehensive analysis of the binary collision
dynamics using three dimensional direct numerical simulations (DNS) with fully
resolved hydrodynamics. From this data, we have constructed a simplified binary
collision model (BCM) which accurately reproduces the collective behavior
obtained from the DNS for most cases. Thus, we show that global alignment can
mostly arise solely from binary collisions. Although the agreement between both
models (DNS and BCM) is not perfect, the parameter range in which notable
differences appear is also that for which strong density fluctuations are
present in the system (where pseudo-sound mound can be observed[1]).

  Redistributing Nonconvexity","Journal version of previous conference paper appeared at ICML-2016
  with same title",,,,"math.OC cs.LG stat.ML","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The use of convex regularizers allows for easy optimization, though they
often produce biased estimation and inferior prediction performance. Recently,
nonconvex regularizers have attracted a lot of attention and outperformed
convex ones. However, the resultant optimization problem is much harder. In
this paper, for a large class of nonconvex regularizers, we propose to move the
nonconvexity from the regularizer to the loss. The nonconvex regularizer is
then transformed to a familiar convex regularizer, while the resultant loss
function can still be guaranteed to be smooth. Learning with the convexified
regularizer can be performed by existing efficient algorithms originally
designed for convex regularizers (such as the proximal algorithm, Frank-Wolfe
algorithm, alternating direction method of multipliers and stochastic gradient
descent). Extensions are made when the convexified regularizer does not have
closed-form proximal step, and when the loss function is nonconvex, nonsmooth.
Extensive experiments on a variety of machine learning application scenarios
show that optimizing the transformed problem is much faster than running the
state-of-the-art on the original problem.

communications are closely monitored by legitimate agencies, is an integral
part of national security. To enhance the information surveillance capability,
we propose in this paper a new proactive eavesdropping approach via a spoofing
relay, where the legitimate monitor operates in a full-duplex manner with
simultaneous eavesdropping and spoofing relaying to vary the source
transmission rate in favor of the eavesdropping performance. To this end, a
power splitting receiver is proposed, where the signal received at each antenna
of the legitimate monitor is split into two parts for information eavesdropping
and spoofing relaying, respectively. We formulate an optimization problem to
maximize the achievable eavesdropping rate by jointly optimizing the power
splitting ratios and relay beamforming matrix at the multi-antenna monitor.
Depending on the suspicious and eavesdropping channel conditions, the optimal
solution corresponds to three possible spoofing relay strategies, namely
\emph{constructive relaying}, \emph{jamming}, and \emph{simultaneous jamming
and destructive relaying}. Numerical results show that the proposed technique
significantly improves the eavesdropping rate of the legitimate monitor as
compared to the existing passive eavesdropping and jamming-based eavesdropping
schemes.

detection with ongoing and future experiments. Most earlier works have assumed
that the EoR 21-cm signal is a Gaussian random field where (1) the error
variance depends only on the power spectrum and the number of Fourier modes in
the particular $k$ bin, and (2) the errors in the different $k$ bins are

very early stages of reionization ($\bar{x}_{\rm HI} \sim 0.9 $) the error
variance significantly exceeds the Gaussian predictions at small length-scales
($k > 0.5 \,{\rm Mpc}^{-1}$) while they are consistent at larger scales. The
errors in most $k$ bins (both large and small scales), are however found to be
correlated. Considering the later stages ($\bar{x}_{\rm HI} = 0.15$), the error
variance shows an excess in all $k$ bins within $k \ge 0.1 \, {\rm Mpc}^{-1}$,
and it is around $200$ times larger than the Gaussian prediction at $k \sim 1

their effect on the mean density of Rydberg states and the full counting
statistics (FCS). We find that while the mean density is almost identical in
both cases, the FCS differ considerably. The main method employed is the
Langevin equation (LE) but for the sake of efficiency in certain regimes, we
use a Markovian master equation and Monte Carlo rate equations, respectively.
In the second case, we consider dissipative systems with more general power-law
interactions. We determine the phase diagram in the steady state and analyse
its generation dynamics using Monte Carlo rate equations. In contrast to
nearest-neighbour models, there is no transition to long-range-ordered phases
for realistic interactions and resonant driving. Yet, for finite laser
detunings, we show that Rydberg lattices can undergo a dissipative phase
transition to a long-range-ordered antiferromagnetic (AF) phase. We identify
the advantages of Monte Carlo rate equations over mean field (MF) predictions.

experiment to perform high sensitivity HXR observations from 4-15 keV using the
new technique of HXR focusing optics. The focal plane detector requires < 100
um position resolution (to take advantage of the angular resolution of the
optics) and about 1 keV energy resolution (FWHM) for spectroscopy down to 4
keV, with moderate cooling (> -30 C). Double-sided silicon strip detectors were
used for the first FOXSI flight in 2012 to meet these criteria. To improve the
detectors' efficiency (66 at 15 keV for the silicon detectors) and position
resolution of 75 um for the second launch, we fabricated double-sided CdTe
strip detectors with a position resolution of 60 um and almost 100 % efficiency
for the FOXSI energy range. The sensitive area is 7.67 mm x 7.67 mm,
corresponding to the field of view of 791'' x 791''. An energy resolution of
about 1 keV (FWHM) and low energy threshold of 4 keV were achieved in
laboratory calibrations. The second launch of FOXSI was performed on December
11, 2014, and images from the Sun were successfully obtained with the CdTe
detector. Therefore we successfully demonstrated the detector concept and the
usefulness of this technique for future HXR observations of the Sun.

quantum system which is weakly coupled to an environment. The combined action
of the modulations and the environment steers the system towards a state being
characterized by a time-periodic density operator. To resolve this asymptotic
non-equilibrium state at stroboscopic instants of time, we introduce the
dissipative Floquet map, evaluate the stroboscopic density operator as its
eigen-element and elucidate how particle interactions affect properties of the
density operator. We illustrate the idea with a periodically modulated
Bose-Hubbard dimer and discuss the relations between the interaction-induced
bifurcations in a mean-field dynamics and changes in the characteristics of the
genuine quantum many-body state. We argue that Floquet maps provide insight
into the system relaxation towards its asymptotic state and may help to
understand whether it is possible (or not) to construct a stroboscopic
time-independent generator mimicking the action of the original time-dependent
one.

alignment (FMA), has been proposed with the functionalities of pattern search
and random access. The FMA is quite efficient in space requirement and pattern
search time, but it is applicable only for an alignment of similar strings
without gaps. In this paper we propose the FM-index of alignment with gaps, a
realistic index for similar strings, which allows gaps in their alignment. For
this, we design a new version of the suffix array of alignment by using
alignment transformation and a new definition of the alignment-suffix. The new
suffix array of alignment enables us to support the LF-mapping and backward
search, the key functionalities of the FM-index, regardless of gap existence in
the alignment. We experimentally compared our index with RLCSA due to Makinen

our index is less than one third of that of RLCSA.

analytic expressions for any \alpha. The idea is to express the mean-density
profile as a simple functional form, and obtain the local density by
derivative. The model involves a concentration parameter c analogous to the NFW
profile. More flexibility is provided by a sum of two such functions, with
concentrations c_1 and c_2. An optional additional parameter is the asymptotic
outer slope -\gamma, which allows more flexibility in the outskirts of haloes.
For \gamma different than 3, there are analytic expressions for the profiles of
density and mass-velocity but not for the potential. We match the proposed
function, in different variants, to the dark-matter profiles of haloes in
cosmological simulations, with and without baryons, spanning inner profiles
that range from steep cusps to flat cores, and find excellent fits. The
analytic potential profile is useful in modeling the evolution of the inner
halo due to episodes of gas inflow and outflow. The analytic profile,
especially with a free \gamma, is useful for a study of environmental effects
in the outer halo. In general, these analytic profiles can serve for
straightforwardly quantifying the shapes of simulated and observed rotation
curves, without the need for numerical integrations.

viz. $\Theta_0 :=T_{\mu\mu} \neq 0$. Measured in the proton, this anomaly
yields $m_p^2$, where $m_p$ is the proton's mass; but, at the same time, when
computed in the pion, the answer is $m_\pi^2=0$. Any attempt to understand the
origin and nature of mass, and identify observable expressions thereof, must
explain and unify these two apparently contradictory results, which are
fundamental to the nature of our Universe. Given the importance of
Poincar\'e-invariance in modern physics, the utility of a frame-dependent
approach to this problem seems limited. That is especially true of any approach
tied to a rest-frame decomposition of $T_{\mu\nu}$ because a massless particle
does not possess a rest-frame. On the other hand, the dynamical chiral symmetry
breaking (DCSB) paradigm, connected with a Poincar\'e-covariant treatment of
the continuum bound-state problem, provides a straightforward, simultaneous
explanation of both these identities, and also a diverse array of predictions,
testable at existing and proposed facilities. From this perspective, $\langle
\pi| \Theta_0 |\pi \rangle =0$ owing to exact, symmetry-driven cancellations
which occur between one-body dressing effects and two-body-irreducible binding
interactions in any well-defined computation of the forward scattering
amplitude that defines this expectation value in the pseudoscalar meson. The
cancellation is incomplete in any other hadronic bound state, with a remainder
whose scale is set by the size of one-body dressing effects.

five and is the most common abnormal heart rhythm. The progression of AF with
age, from short self-terminating episodes to persistence, varies between
individuals and is poorly understood. An inability to understand and predict
variation in AF progression has resulted in less patient-specific therapy.
Likewise, it has been a challenge to relate the microstructural features of
heart muscle tissue (myocardial architecture) with the emergent temporal
clinical patterns of AF. We use a simple model of activation wavefront
propagation on an anisotropic structure, mimicking heart muscle tissue, to show
how variation in AF behaviour arises naturally from microstructural differences
between individuals. We show that the stochastic nature of progressive
transversal uncoupling of muscle strands (e.g., due to fibrosis or gap
junctional remodelling), as occurs with age, results in variability in AF
episode onset time, frequency, duration, burden and progression between
individuals. This is consistent with clinical observations. The uncoupling of
muscle strands can cause critical architectural patterns in the myocardium.
These critical patterns anchor micro-re-entrant wavefronts and thereby trigger
AF. It is the number of local critical patterns of uncoupling as opposed to
global uncoupling that determines AF progression. This insight may eventually
lead to patient specific therapy when it becomes possible to observe the
cellular structure of a patient's heart.

high waves is disclosed within the framework of integrable modified Korteweg -
de Vries (mKdV) equation. Optimal conditions for the focusing of many solitons
are formulated explicitly. Namely, trains of ordered solitons with alternate
polarities evolve to huge strongly localized transient waves. The focused wave
amplitude is exactly the sum of the focusing soliton heights; the maximum wave
inherits the polarity of the fastest soliton in the train. The focusing of
several solitary waves or/and breathers may naturally occur in a soliton gas
and will lead to rogue-wave-type dynamics; hence it represents a new nonlinear
mechanism of rogue wave generation. The discovered scenario depends crucially
on the soliton polarities (phases), and thus cannot be taken into account by
existing kinetic theories. The performance of the soliton mechanism of rogue
wave generation is shown for the example of focusing mKdV equation, when
solitons possess 'frozen' phases (polarities), though the approach works in
other integrable systems which admit soliton and breather solutions.

in the half-filled quantum Hall system was proposed [D. T. Son, Phys. Rev. X 5,

of composite fermions (CF's). One of the main consequences is the existence of
anisotropic states in single and bilayer systems, which was previously
suggested in Ref. [J. S. Jeong and K. Park, Phys. Rev. B 91, 195119 (2015)]. We
argue that in the half-filled single layer the gapped states may sustain
anisotropy, because isotropic pairings may coexist with anisotropic ones.
Furthermore, anisotropic pairings with addition of a particle-hole (PH)
symmetry breaking mass term may evolve into rotationally symmetric states, i.e.
Pfaffian states of Halperin-Lee-Read (HLR) ordinary CF's. On the basis of the
Dirac formalism, we argue that in the quantum Hall bilayer at total filling
one, with decreasing distance between layers weak pairing of p-wave paired CF's
is gradually transformed from Dirac to ordinary, HLR-like, with concomitant
decrease in the CF number. Global characterization of low-energy spectrum based
on the Dirac CF's agrees well with previous calculations performed by exact
diagonalization on a torus. Finally, we discuss features of Dirac formalism
when applied in this context.

the order ${1/N}$, the evolution of the system is characterised by the first
two equations of the BBGKY hierarchy involving the system's 1-body distribution

auxiliary fields, these two evolution constraints may be rewritten as a
functional integral. When functionally integrated over the 2-body correlation
function, this rewriting leads to a new constraint coupling the 1-body

constraint provides, through a new route, the closed non-linear kinetic
equation satisfied by the 1-body distribution function. Such a method sheds new
lights on the origin of these kinetic equations complementing the traditional

flow model (CF) is particularly powerful, since it allows transactions to
delegate computation to remote nodes as well as access shared data. However,
there are no existing CF DTM systems that perform on par with state-of-the-art
systems operating in other models. Hence, we introduce a CF DTM synchronization
algorithm, OptSVA-CF. It supports fine-grained pessimistic concurrency control,
so it avoids aborts, and thus avoids problems with irrevocable operations.
Furthermore, it uses early release and asynchrony to parallelize concurrent
transactions to a high degree, while retaining strong safety properties. We
implement it as Atomic RMI 2, in effect producing a CF DTM system that, as our
evaluation shows, can outperform a state-of-the-art non-CF DTM such as HyFlow2.

the form of $n$ experimental units, such that $X_{i,1},\ldots,X_{i,p_{i}}$ are

convergence of a (possibly smoothed) empirical Wasserstein barycenter towards
its population counterpart in the asymptotic setting where both $n$ and

we numerically and theoretically investigate the behaviour of ensembles of
self-spinning dimers. We find that geometric frustration of dimer rotation by
interactions yields spatiotemporal order and active melting with no equilibrium
counterparts. At low density, the spinning dimers self-assemble into a
triangular lattice with their orientations phase-locked into spatially periodic
phases. The phase-locked patterns form dynamical analogues of the ground states
of various spin models, transitioning from the 3-state Potts antiferromagnet at
low densities to the striped herringbone phase of planar quadrupoles at higher
densities. As the density is raised further, the competition between active
rotations and interactions leads to melting of the active spinner crystal.
Emergent edge currents, whose direction is set by the chirality of the active
spinning, arise as a non-equilibrium signature of the transition to the active
spinner liquid and vanish when the system eventually undergoes kinetic arrest
at very high densities. Our findings may be realized in systems ranging from
liquid crystal and colloidal experiments to tabletop realizations using
macroscopic chiral grains.

descriptions are represented as rules inferred from one or more disjoint sets

approaches that typically create one smaller set of redescriptions satisfying a
pre-defined set of constraints, we introduce a framework that creates large and
heterogeneous redescription set from which user/expert can extract compact sets

large and heterogeneous redescription set relies on CLUS-RM algorithm and a
novel, conjunctive refinement procedure that facilitates generation of larger

significantly extends applicability of the method. Crucial part of the
framework is the redescription set extraction based on heuristic
multi-objective optimization procedure that allows user to define importance

dark-in-bright dipolar quasi-two-dimensional Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC)
solitons on a one-dimensional (1D) optical-lattice (OL) potential. These
solitons mobile in a plane perpendicular to the 1D OL trap can have both
repulsive and attractive contact interactions. The dark-in-bright solitons are
the excited states of the bright solitons. The solitons, when subject to a
small perturbation, exhibit sustained breathing oscillation. The dark-in-bright
solitons can be created by phase imprinting a bright soliton. At medium
velocities the collision between two solitons is found to be quasi elastic.The
results are demonstrated by a numerical simulation of the three-dimensional
mean-field Gross-Pitaevskii equation in three spatial dimensions employing
realistic interaction parameters for a dipolar $^{164}$Dy BEC.

  pseudospectra of band-dominated operators",,,,,"math.SP math.NA","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We study spectra and pseudospectra of certain bounded linear operators on
$\ell^2({\mathbb Z})$. The operators are generally non-normal, and their matrix
representation has a characteristic off-diagonal decay. Based on a result of
Chandler-Wilde, Chonchaiya and Lindner for tridiagonal infinite matrices, we
demonstrate an efficient algorithm for the computation of upper and lower
bounds on the pseudospectrum of operators that are merely norm limits of band
matrices -- the so-called band-dominated operators. After approximation by a
band matrix and fixing a parameter $n\in{\mathbb N}$, one looks at $n$
consecutive columns $\{k+1,...,k+n\}$, $k\in{\mathbb Z}$, of the corresponding
matrix and computes the smallest singular value of that section via QR
factorization. We here propose a QR factorization by a sequence of Givens
rotations in such a way that a large part of the computation can be reused for
the factorization of the next submatrix -- when $k$ is replaced by $k+1$. The
computational cost for the next factorization(s) is ${\mathcal O}(nd)$ as
opposed to a naive implementation with ${\mathcal O}(nd^2)$, where $d$ is the
bandwidth. So our algorithm pays off for large bands, which is attractive when
approximating band-dominated operators with a full (i.e. not banded) matrix.

YBa$_{2}$Cu$_{3}$O$_{6+\delta }$ high-temperature superconductors has a
prominent low-frequency peak with two smaller neighbouring peaks. The
separation and positions of these three peaks are almost independent of doping.
This pattern has been explained previously by rather special, exquisitely
detailed, Fermi-surface reconstruction. We propose that these MQO have a
different origin, and their frequencies are related to the bilayer and
inter-bilayer electron hopping rather than directly to the areas of tiny
Fermi-surface pockets. Such so-called ""slow oscillations"" explain more
naturally many features of the observed oscillations and allow us to estimate
the inter-layer transfer integrals and in-plane Fermi momentum.

ALMA observations of the high-mass star-forming region G35.20-0.74N
have revealed the presence of a Keplerian disk in core B rotating about a
massive object of 18 Msun, as computed from the velocity field. The luminosity
of such a massive star would be comparable to (or higher than) the luminosity
of the whole star-forming region. To solve this problem it has been proposed
that core B could harbor a binary system. This could also explain the possible
precession of the radio jet associated with this core, which has been suggested
by its S-shaped morphology. Aims. To establish the origin of the free-free
emission from core B and investigate the existence of a binary system at the
center of this massive core and the possible precession of the radio jet.
Methods. We carried out VLA continuum observations of G35.20-0.74N at 2 cm in
the B configuration and at 1.3 cm and 7 mm in the A and B configurations. The
bandwidth at 7 mm covers the CH3OH maser line at 44.069 GHz. Continuum images
at 6 and 3.6 cm in the A configuration were obtained from the VLA archive. We
also carried out VERA observations of the H2O maser line at 22.235 GHz.
Results. The observations have revealed the presence of a binary system of
UC/HC HII regions at the geometrical center of the radio jet in G35.20-0.74N.
This binary system, which is associated with a Keplerian rotating disk,
consists of two B-type stars of 11 and 6 Msun. The S-shaped morphology of the
radio jet has been successfully explained as due to precession produced by the
binary system. The analysis of the precession of the radio jet has allowed us
to better interpret the IR emission in the region, which would be not tracing a
wide-angle cavity open by a single outflow with a position angle of ~55 deg but
two different flows: a precessing one in the NE-SW direction associated with
the radio jet, and a second one in an almost E--W direction ...

extensive and fully-resolved statistical analyses. However, data acquisition in
real-life is subjected to the wide heterogeneity that characterizes crowd flows
over time. Disparate flow conditions, such as co-flows and counter-flows at low
and at high pedestrian densities, typically follow randomly one another. When
analysing the data in order to study the dynamics and behaviour of pedestrians
it is crucial to be able disentangle and to properly select (query) data from
statistically homogeneous flow conditions in order to avoid spurious statistics
and to enable qualitative comparisons. In this paper we extend our previous
analysis on the asymmetric pedestrian dynamics on a staircase landing, where we
collected a large statistical database of measurements from ad hoc continuous
recordings. This contribution has a two-fold aim: first, method-wise, we
discuss two possible approaches to query experimental datasets for homogeneous
flow conditions. For given flow conditions, we can either agglomerate
measurements on a time-frame basis (Eulerian queries) or on a trajectory basis
(Lagrangian queries). Second, we employ these two different perspectives to
further explore asymmetries in the pedestrian dynamics in our measurement site.
We report cross-comparisons of statistics of pedestrian positions, velocities
and accelerations vs. flow conditions as well as vs. Eulerian or Lagrangian
approach.

the following main goals in mind: (a) provide a unified data model for
meta-data of all instruments and observational modes, (b) quickly find

every observation in a larger area of the sky, (d) allow for finding solar
system objects crossing observation fields. As a first step, we developed a
unified data model of observations of all three Herschel instruments for all
pointing and instrument modes. Then, using telescope pointing information and
observational meta-data, we compiled a database of footprints. As opposed to
methods using pixellation of the sphere, we represent sky coverage in an exact
geometric form allowing for precise area calculations. For easier handling of
Herschel observation footprints with rather complex shapes, two algorithms were
implemented to reduce the outline. Furthermore, a new visualisation tool to
plot footprints with various spherical projections was developed. Indexing of
the footprints using Hierarchical Triangular Mesh makes it possible to quickly
find observations based on sky coverage, time and meta-data. The database is

immunity. Assuming that repeated exposure to the pathogen fully restores
immunity, we derive an SIRS-type model with discrete and distributed delays.
First we prove usual results, namely that if the basic reproduction number,
$\mathcal{R}_0$, is less or equal than $1$, then the disease free equilibrium
is globally asymptotically stable, whereas for $\mathcal{R}_0>1$ the disease
persists in the population. The interesting features of boosting appear with
respect to the endemic equilibrium, which can go through multiple stability
switches by changing the key model parameters. We construct two-parameter
stability charts, showing that increasing the delay can stabilize the positive
equilibrium. Increasing $\mathcal{R}_0$, the endemic equilibrium can cross two
distinct regions of instability, separated by Hopf-bifurcations. Our results
show that the dynamics of infectious diseases with boosting of immunity can be

(SI) is a new definition of the ampere based on the elementary charge \emph{e}.
Replacing the former definition based on Amp\`ere's force law will allow one to
fully benefit from quantum physics to realize the ampere. However, a quantum
realization of the ampere from \emph{e}, accurate to within $10^{-8}$ in
relative value and fulfilling traceability needs, is still missing despite many
efforts have been spent for the development of single-electron tunneling
devices. Starting again with Ohm's law, applied here in a quantum circuit
combining the quantum Hall resistance and Josephson voltage standards with a
superconducting cryogenic amplifier, we report on a practical and universal
programmable quantum current generator. We demonstrate that currents generated
in the milliampere range are quantized in terms of $ef_\mathrm{J}$
($f_\mathrm{J}$ is the Josephson frequency) with a measurement uncertainty of
$10^{-8}$. This new quantum current source, able to deliver such accurate
currents down to the microampere range, can greatly improve the current
measurement traceability, as demonstrated with the calibrations of digital
ammeters. Beyond, it opens the way to further developments in metrology and in
fundamental physics, such as a quantum multimeter or new accurate comparisons

dimension $N\geq 2$ for a isothermal model of capillary fluids derived by J.E
Dunn and J.Serrin (1985) (see \cite{fDS}), which can be used as a phase
transition model. We will restrict us to the case of the so called compressible
Navier-Stokes system with quantum pressure which corresponds to consider the
capillary coefficient $\kappa(\rho)=\frac{\kappa_1}{\rho}$ with $\kappa_1>0$.
In a first part we prove the existence of strong solution in finite time for
large initial data with a precise bound by below on the life span $T^*$. This
one depends on the norm of the initial data $(\rho_0,v_0)$. The second part
consists in proving the existence of global strong solution with particular
choice on the capillary coefficient ( where $\kappa_1=\mu^2$) and on the
viscosity tensor which corresponds to the viscous shallow water case $-2\mu{\rm
div}(\rho Du)$. To do this we derivate different energy estimate on the density
and the effective velocity $v$ which ensures that the strong solution can be
extended beyond $T^*$. The main difficulty consists in controlling the vacuum
or in other words to estimate the $L^\infty$ norm of $\frac{1}{\rho}$. The
proof relies mostly on a method introduced by De Giorgi \cite{DG} (see also
Ladyzhenskaya et al in \cite{La} for the parabolic case) to obtain regularity
results for elliptic equations with discontinuous diffusion coefficients and a
suitable bootstrap argument.

picking from a set of actions based on contextual information.
Reinforcement-based learning algorithms such as contextual bandits can be very
effective in these settings, but applying them in practice is fraught with
technical debt, and no general system exists that supports them completely. We
address this and create the first general system for contextual learning,
called the Decision Service.
  Existing systems often suffer from technical debt that arises from issues
like incorrect data collection and weak debuggability, issues we systematically
address through our ML methodology and system abstractions. The Decision
Service enables all aspects of contextual bandit learning using four system
abstractions which connect together in a loop: explore (the decision space),
log, learn, and deploy. Notably, our new explore and log abstractions ensure
the system produces correct, unbiased data, which our learner uses for online
learning and to enable real-time safeguards, all in a fully reproducible
manner.
  The Decision Service has a simple user interface and works with a variety of
applications: we present two live production deployments for content
recommendation that achieved click-through improvements of 25-30%, another with
18% revenue lift in the landing page, and ongoing applications in tech support
and machine failure handling. The service makes real-time decisions and learns

  Properties or Measurement Outcomes?","Welcome!",,,,"quant-ph physics.hist-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In this paper we attempt to analyze the physical and philosophical meaning of
quantum contextuality. We will argue that there exists a general confusion
within the foundational literature arising from the improper ""scrambling"" of
two different meanings of quantum contextuality. While the first one,
introduced by Bohr, is related to an epistemic interpretation of contextuality
which stresses the incompatibility (or complementarity) of certain measurement
situations described in classical terms; the second meaning of contextuality is
related to a purely formal understanding of contextuality as exposed by the
Kochen-Specker (KS) theorem which focuses instead on the constraints of the
orthodox quantum formalism in order to interpret projection operators as
preexistent or actual (definite valued) properties. We will show how these two
notions have been scrambled together creating an ""omelette of contextuality""
which has been fully widespread through a popularized ""epistemic explanation""
of the KS theorem according to which: The measurement outcome of the observable
A when measured together with B or together with C will necessarily differ in
case [A, B] = [A, C] = 0, and [B, C] /= 0. We will show why this statement is
not only improperly scrambling epistemic and formal perspectives, but is also
physically and philosophically meaningless. Finally, we analyze the
consequences of such widespread epistemic reading of KS theorem as related to
statistical statements of measurement outcomes.

The AFM structure of the Mn spins is also unclear. A 4% substitution of K for
Eu in Eu0.96K0.04Mn2As2 is sufficient to induce a metallic ground state.
Evidence is found for a difference in the AFM structure of the Eu moments in
the metallic crystals from that of undoped EuMn2As2 versus both T and H. For
metallic Eu0.96K0.04Mn2As2 and Eu0.93K0.07Mn2As2, an anomalous S-shape T
dependence of \rho related to the Mn magnetism is found. Upon cooling from 200
K, \rho exhibits a strong negative curvature, reaches maximum positive slope at
the Mn T_N ~ 150 K, and then continues to decrease but more slowly below T_N.
This suggests that dynamic short-range AFM order of the Mn spins above the Mn
T_N strongly suppresses the resistivity, contrary to the conventional decrease
of \rho that is only observed upon cooling below T_N of an antiferromagnet.

reveals that the impact of random alloy fluctuations on the electronic and

as the lateral size of the dot increases and approaches realistic sizes. For
instance the optical matrix element shows an almost vanishing anisotropy in the

characterization of meteorites. It is installed in a medium depth (~620 m.w.e.)
underground laboratory in Switzerland in a multi-layer shielding and is
equipped with an active muon veto. We have reached a very competitive integral
background rate of (246$\pm$2) counts/day (100-2700 keV) and measured a
sensitivity of $\sim$0.5-0.6 mBq/kg for long-lived isotopes from the
$^{238}$U/$^{232}$Th chains in a $\sim$1\,kg sample screened for $\sim$27 days.
An extrapolation to higher sample masses and measurement times suggests a
maximum sensitivity in the $\mathcal{O}(50)$ \mu Bq/kg range. We describe the
data analysis based on Bayesian statistics, background simulations, the
efficiency calibration and first sample measurements.

limit theory for non-linear geometric statistics (such as clique counts,
intrinsic volumes of the Boolean model, and total edge length of the
$k$-nearest neighbors graph) of $\alpha$-determinantal point processes having
fast decreasing kernels extending the CLTs of Soshnikov (2002) to non-linear

$\alpha$-permanental point processes and the zero set of Gaussian entire
functions, extending the CLTs of Nazarov and Sodin (2012) and Shirai and
Takahashi (2003), which are also confined to linear statistics. The proof of
the central limit theorem relies on a factorial moment expansion originating in
Blaszczyszyn (1995), Blaszczyszyn, Merzbach, Schmidt (1997) to show the fast
decay of the correlations of $\xi$-weighted point measures. The latter property
is shown to imply a condition equivalent to Brillinger mixing and consequently

reduced/analyzed about 300 orbits of multicolor images taken with the Advanced

Furthermore, our size derivation allows, and therefore is not biased by, the
presence of the usual variety of morphological structures seen in early-type
galaxies, such as bulges, bars, disks, isophote twists, and ellipiticy
gradients. By using such a mass-selected sample, composed of 244 red-sequence

should be excluded as the primary drivers of size evolution because we observed
an environmental environmental dependent size growth. Using spectroscopic ages
of Coma early-type galaxies we also find that recently quenched early-type
galaxies are a numerically minor population not different enough in size to
alter the mean size at a given mass, which implies that the progenitor bias is
minor, i.e., that the size evolution measured by selecting galaxies at the
redshift of observation is indistinguishable from the one that compares

magnetic field strength for magnetospheres with saturated convection potential,

magnetospheric convection at hot Jupiters will be saturated, and thus unable to
dissipate the full available incident Poynting flux, such that the magnetic
Radiometric Bode's Law (RBL) presents a substantial overestimation of the radio
powers for hot Jupiters. Our radio powers for hot Jupiters are $\sim$5-1300 TW

with weaker magnetic fields our powers are higher at larger orbital distances
than given by the RBL, and there are many configurations of planet that are

that $j(x)=x$ for every $x$ in the transitive closure of $m$ (where the
transitive closure of $m$ is computed within $\mathcal{M}$). Here we study the
class $\mathcal{C}$ of structures of the form $\mathcal{I}_{\mathrm{fix}}(j)$,
where the ambient model $\mathcal{M}$ satisfies a frugal yet robust fragment of
$\mathrm{ZFC}$ known as $\mathrm{MOST}$, and $j(m)=m$ whenever $m$ is a finite
ordinal in the sense of $\mathcal{M}$. We show that every structure in
$\mathcal{C}$ satisfies
$\mathrm{MOST}+\Delta_0^\mathcal{P}\textrm{-Collection}$. We also show that the
following countable structures are in $\mathcal{C}$: (a) transitive models of
$\mathrm{MOST}+\Delta_0^\mathcal{P}\textrm{-Collection}$, (b) recursively
saturated models of $\mathrm{MOST}+\Delta_0^\mathcal{P}\textrm{-Collection}$,
(c) models of $\mathrm{ZFC}$. It follows from (b) that the theory of
$\mathcal{C}$ is precisely $\mathrm{MOST+\Delta}_{0}^{\mathcal{P}}$-Collection.
We conclude by proving a refinement of a result due to Amir Togha.

rotating polytropes. Equations are developed using MSQI coordinates, but taking
a logarithm of the radial coordinate. The result is relatively simple
elliptical differential equations. Due to the logarithmic scale, we can resolve
solutions with near-singular mass distributions near their center, while the
solution domain extends many orders of magnitude larger than the radius of the
distribution (to connect with flat space-time). Rotating solutions are found
with very high central energy densities for a range of adiabatic exponents.
Analytically, assuming the pressure is proportional to the energy density
(which is true for polytropes in the limit of large energy density), we
determine the small radius behavior of the metric potentials and energy
density. This small radius behavior agrees well with the small radius behavior
of large central density numerical results, lending confidence to our numerical
approach. We compare results with rotating solutions available in the
literature, which show good agreement. We study the stability of spherical
solutions: instability sets in at the first maximum in mass versus central
energy density; this is also consistent with results in the literature, and
further lends confidence to the numerical approach.

based on the main klystron operation parameters. This is being done by
simulating klystron performances for various cavity parameters including the
number of cavities, inter-cavity distance, and cavity tuning frequencies. The
simulation has been done with the FCI (field charge interaction) code aided by
a matlab script for scanning input parameters. Initial set of scan parameters
was obtained by benchmarking the E3762 klystron. It was possible to obtain
optimized design parameters with better efficiency for a cavity system adopting
a multi-cell output cavity. However, the multi-cell output cavity is prone to
produce a self-oscillation due to the prolonged (several half RF periods)
beam-field interaction along its multiple gaps. We have checked the feasibility
of the optimization by evaluating the stability of output cavity system. The
stability is given by the ratio of a beam-loading conductance to the circuit
conductance.
