nanoparticles or molecules. However, operating in air or vacuum still remains
very challenging since most approaches are limited to a liquid environment. In

introduced in order to locate a subset of the compression spectrum of the
linearized operator around the wave, whereas the point spectrum is proved to be
stable with the use of energy estimates. Detailed asymptotic decay estimates of
solutions to spectral equations are required in order to close the energy

paid to the problem of plane waves matched to the GSHDB boundary, defined by a
2D dispersion equation for the wave vector, making the reflection dyadic
indeterminate. Examples of dispersion curves for various chosen parameters of
the GSHDB boundary are given. Conditions for a possible medium whose interface

determination of the jet quenching parameter, $\hat q$. We present here an
extraction of this parameter using data of inclusive particle suppression at
RHIC and LHC energies for different centralities. Our approach consists of
fitting a $K$ factor that quantifies the departure of this parameter from an
ideal estimate, $K\equiv \hat q/(2\epsilon^{3/4})$, where $\hat q$ is
determined by the local medium quantities as provided by hydrodynamical
calculations. We find that this $K$ factor is larger at RHIC than at the LHC,
as obtained already in previous analyses, but, surprisingly, it is almost
independent of the centrality of the collision. Taken at face value, the $K$
factor would not depend on the local properties of the medium as energy density
or temperature, but on global collision quantities such as the center of mass
energy. This is a very intriguing, unexpected possibility for which we cannot
yet provide a clear interpretation. We also comment on the limitations of the
formalism that may affect this conclusion.

spectra of nine solar twins, we obtained precise estimates of stellar ages and
chemical abundances. These determinations have been integrated with additional
accurate age and abundance determinations from recent spectroscopic studies of
solar twins existing in the literature, comprising superb abundances with
0.01~dex precision. Based on this data set, we outlined the [X/Fe]-age

Co, Ni, Cu, Zn, Y, Ba, La, Ce, Nd, and Eu). Each different class of elements
showed distinct evolution with time that relies on the different
characteristics, rates and timescales of the nucleosynthesis' sites from which
they are produced. The $\alpha$-elements are characterised by a [X/Fe]
decrement as time goes on. Strikingly, an opposite behaviour is observed for
Ca. The iron-peak elements show an early [X/Fe] increase followed by a decrease
towards the youngest stars. The [X/Fe] for the n-capture elements decrease with
age. We also found that both [Mg/Y] and [Al/Y] are precise stellar clocks, with
[Al/Y] showing the steepest dependence with age. Conslusions: Knowledge of the
[X/Fe]-age relations is a gold mine from which we can achieve a great
understanding about the processes that governed the formation and evolution of
the Milky Way. Through the reverse engineering of these relations we will be
able to put strong constraints on the nature of the stellar formation history,
the SNe rates, the stellar yields, and the variety of the SNe progenitors.

linear or quadratic. On the other hand, the temporal variation of the spatial
distributions of faculae, network and sunspots follows patterns that are less
obviously correlated, so that we expect the relation that describes variation
of the area coverage of different types of magnetic features to vary with the
position over the disk. In this work we employ MDI full-disk magnetograms
acquired during Cycle 23 and at the beginning of Cycle 24 to investigate the
relation between the coverage of magnetic elements characterized by different
amounts of magnetic flux and located at different angular distances from disk
center with the sunspot number. In agreement with some previous studies we find
that daily data are best described by a quadratic function while data averaged
over 6-months are best described by a linear function. In both cases the

THGEM and GEM, explaining the less pronounced gain discrepancies observed in
GEM.

collecting iris images in the spring semester of 2004. The initial data
collections used an LG 2200 iris imaging system for image acquisition. Image
datasets acquired in 2004-2005 at Notre Dame with this LG 2200 have been used
in the ICE 2005 and ICE 2006 iris biometric evaluations. The ICE 2005 iris
image dataset has been distributed to over 100 research groups around the
world. The purpose of this document is to describe the content of the
ND-IRIS-0405 iris image dataset. This dataset is a superset of the iris image
datasets used in ICE 2005 and ICE 2006. The ND 2004-2005 iris image dataset
contains 64,980 images corresponding to 356 unique subjects, and 712 unique
irises. The age range of the subjects is 18 to 75 years old. 158 of the

of a system with quenched randomness. The basic tool of this technique is a
distributional zeta-function. The distributional zeta-function is a complex
function whose derivative at the origin yields the average free energy of the
system as the sum of two contributions: the first one is a series in which all
the integer moments of the partition function of the model contribute; the
second one, which can not be written as a series of the integer moments, can be
made as small as desired. In this paper we present a mathematical rigorous
proof that the average free energy of one disordered $\lambda\varphi^{4}$ model
defined in a zero-dimensional space can be obtained using the distributional
zeta-function technique. We obtain an analytic expression for the average free
energy of the model.

  Black Hole Coalescence","14 pages, 5 figures","Phys. Rev. Lett. 116, 241103 (2016)","10.1103/PhysRevLett.116.241103","LIGO-P151226","gr-qc astro-ph.HE","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  We report the observation of a gravitational-wave signal produced by the
coalescence of two stellar-mass black holes. The signal, GW151226, was observed
by the twin detectors of the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave
Observatory (LIGO) on December 26, 2015 at 03:38:53 UTC. The signal was
initially identified within 70 s by an online matched-filter search targeting
binary coalescences. Subsequent off-line analyses recovered GW151226 with a
network signal-to-noise ratio of 13 and a significance greater than 5 $\sigma$.
The signal persisted in the LIGO frequency band for approximately 1 s,
increasing in frequency and amplitude over about 55 cycles from 35 to 450 Hz,
and reached a peak gravitational strain of $3.4_{-0.9}^{+0.7} \times 10^{-22}$.
The inferred source-frame initial black hole masses are $14.2_{-3.7}^{+8.3}
M_{\odot}$ and $7.5_{-2.3}^{+2.3} M_{\odot}$ and the final black hole mass is
$20.8_{-1.7}^{+6.1} M_{\odot}$. We find that at least one of the component
black holes has spin greater than 0.2. This source is located at a luminosity
distance of $440_{-190}^{+180}$ Mpc corresponding to a redshift
$0.09_{-0.04}^{+0.03}$. All uncertainties define a 90 % credible interval. This
second gravitational-wave observation provides improved constraints on stellar
populations and on deviations from general relativity.

12, 2015 to January 19, 2016, saw the first detections of gravitational waves
from binary black hole mergers. In this paper we present full results from a
search for binary black hole merger signals with total masses up to $100
M_\odot$ and detailed implications from our observations of these systems. Our
search, based on general-relativistic models of gravitational wave signals from
binary black hole systems, unambiguously identified two signals, GW150914 and
GW151226, with a significance of greater than $5\sigma$ over the observing
period. It also identified a third possible signal, LVT151012, with
substantially lower significance, and with an 87% probability of being of
astrophysical origin. We provide detailed estimates of the parameters of the
observed systems. Both GW150914 and GW151226 provide an unprecedented
opportunity to study the two-body motion of a compact-object binary in the
large velocity, highly nonlinear regime. We do not observe any deviations from
general relativity, and place improved empirical bounds on several high-order
post-Newtonian coefficients. From our observations we infer stellar-mass binary
black hole merger rates lying in the range $9-240 \mathrm{Gpc}^{-3}
\mathrm{yr}^{-1}$. These observations are beginning to inform astrophysical
predictions of binary black hole formation rates, and indicate that future
observing runs of the Advanced detector network will yield many more
gravitational wave detections.

galaxy assembly history which is crucial for our understanding of galaxy
physics. Here we present the complex data analysis for a lenticular galaxy NGC
448, which has been recently suspected to host a counter-rotating stellar
component. We collected deep long-slit spectroscopic observations using the
Russian 6-m telescope and performed the photometric decomposition of Sloan
Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) archival images. We exploited (i) a non-parametric
approach in order to recover stellar line-of-sight velocity distributions and
(ii) a parametric spectral decomposition technique in order to disentangle
stellar population properties of both main and counter-rotating stellar discs.
Our spectral decomposition stays in perfect agreement with the photometric
analysis. The counter-rotating component contributes $\approx$30 per cent to
the total galaxy light. We estimated its stellar mass to be
$9.0^{+2.7}_{-1.8}\cdot10^{9}M_\odot$. The radial scale length of
counter-rotating disc is $\approx$3 times smaller than that of the main disc.
Both discs harbour old stars but the counter-rotating components reveals a
detectable negative age gradient that might suggest an extended inside-out
formation during $3\dots4$ Gyrs. The counter-rotating disc hosts more
metal-rich stars and possesses a shallower metallicity gradient with respect to
the main disc. Our findings rule out cosmological filaments as a source of
external accretion which is considered as a potential mechanism of the
counter-rotating component formation in NGC 448, and favour the satellite
merger event with the consequent slow gas accretion.

of mammals that fire when the animal is located near certain specific points in
its familiar terrain. Intriguingly, these points form, for a single cell, a
two-dimensional triangular grid, not unlike our Figure 3. Grid cells are widely
believed to be involved in path integration, that is, the maintenance of a
location state through the summation of small displacements. We provide
theoretical evidence for this assertion by showing that cells with grid-like
tuning curves are indeed well adapted for the path integration task. In
particular we prove that, in one dimension under Gaussian noise, the
sensitivity of measuring small displacements is maximized by a population of
neurons whose tuning curves are near-sinusoids -- that is to say, with peaks
forming a one-dimensional grid. We also show that effective computation of the
displacement is possible through a second population of cells whose sinusoid
tuning curves are in phase difference from the first. In two dimensions, under
additional assumptions it can be shown that measurement sensitivity is
optimized by the product of two sinusoids, again yielding a grid-like pattern.

were introduced by the second author, generalizing Vinberg's definition for
undirected graphs. In our previous work we have shown that quivers with
strictly subadditive labelings are exactly the quivers exhibiting Zamolodchikov
periodicity. In this paper, we classify all quivers with subadditive labelings.
We conjecture them to exhibit a certain form of integrability, namely, as the
$T$-system dynamics proceeds, the values at each vertex satisfy a linear
recurrence. Conversely, we show that every quiver integrable in this sense is
necessarily one of the $19$ items in our classification. For the quivers of
type $\hat A \otimes A$ we express the coefficients of the recurrences in terms
of the partition functions for domino tilings of a cylinder, called
\emph{Goncharov-Kenyon Hamiltonians}. We also consider tropical $T$-systems of
type $\hat A \otimes A$ and explain how affine slices exhibit solitonic
behavior, i.e. soliton resolution and speed conservation. Throughout, we
conjecture how the results in the paper are expected to generalize from $\hat A
\otimes A$ to all other quivers in our classification.

becomes exactly flat, but the topology remains non-trivial and corresponds to
two copies of Minkowski space glued together along the disk encircled by the

galactic nuclei where massive star clusters reside. With masses of ~10^7M_Sun
and sizes of only a few parsecs, nuclear star clusters are the densest stellar
systems observed in the local universe and represent a robust environment where
(stellar mass) black hole binaries can dynamically form, harden and merge. We
show that due to their large escape speeds, nuclear star clusters can keep a
large fraction of their merger remnants while also evolving rapidly enough that
the holes can sink back to the central regions where they can swap in new
binaries that can subsequently harden and merge. This process can repeat
several times and produce black hole mergers of several tens of solar masses
similar to GW150914 and up to a few hundreds of solar masses, without the need
of invoking extremely low metallicity environments or implausible initial
conditions. We use a semi-analytical approach to describe the formation and
dynamics of black holes in massive star clusters. We find a black hole binary
merger rate per volume from nuclear star clusters of ~1.5 Gpc^-3 yr^-1,
implying up to a few tens of possible detections per year with Advanced LIGO.
Our models suggest a local merger rate of 0.3- 1 Gpc^-3 yr^-1 for high mass
black hole binaries similar to GW150914 (total mass >~ 50 M_Sun, redshift z<
0.3); a merger rate comparable to that of high mass black hole binaries that
are dynamically assembled in globular clusters. Finally, we show that if all
black holes receive high natal kicks, >~50km s^-1, then nuclear star clusters
could dominate the local merger rate of binary black holes compared to the
merger rate of similar binaries produced in either globular clusters or through
isolated binary evolution.

obtained within a Hamiltonian formalism, which takes into account retardation
effects in the dipolar interaction between the nanoparticles and considers the
dielectric properties of the nanoparticles as well as their surrounding. Within
this model we predict polaritonic splittings in the near-infrared to the
visible range of the electromagnetic spectrum that depend on polarization,
lattice symmetry and wavevector direction. Finally, we show that the
predictions of our model are in excellent quantitative agreement with
conventional finite-difference frequency-domain simulations, but with the
advantages of analytical insight and significantly reduced computational cost.

to statistically assess the typical properties (mass, distance, angular size,

clump configurations, yet consistent with results from numerical simulations,
we revisit and compare various calculations made for the Fermi-LAT instrument,
in terms of number of dark clumps expected and the angular power spectrum for
the Galactic signal. We then focus on the prospects of detecting dark clumps
with the future CTA instrument, for which we make a detailed sensitivity
analysis using open-source CTA software. Based on a realistic scenario for the

study, considering three mass points $M_R=0.75,\,1.5\,,2.5$ TeV, and show that
the $\gamma\gamma$, $WW$, $gg$ and light and heavy $q\overline{q}$ initiated
cases lead to distinct predictions for the jet multiplicity distributions. As
an example, we apply this result to the ATLAS search for resonances in diphoton
events, using the 2015 data set of $3.2\,{\rm fb}^{-1}$ at $\sqrt{s}=13$ TeV.
Taking the spin-0 selection, we demonstrate that a dominantly $gg$-initiated
signal hypothesis is mildly disfavoured, while the $\gamma\gamma$ and light
quark cases give good descriptions within the limited statistics, and a
dominantly $WW$-initiated hypothesis is found to be in strong tension with the
data. We also comment on the $b\overline{b}$ initial state, which can already
be constrained by the measured $b$-jet multiplicity. Finally, we present
expected exclusion limits with integrated luminosity, and demonstrate that with
just a few 10's of ${\rm fb}^{-1}$ we can expect to constrain the production
modes of such a resonance.

effect in a kagom\'e lattice ferromagnet Cu(1-3, bdc) has inspired the search

inversion center allowing a Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya (DM) spin-orbit interaction.
The star lattice (also known as the decorated honeycomb lattice) ferromagnets
is an ideal candidate for this purpose because it is a variant of the kagom\'e
lattice with additional links that connect the up-pointing and down-pointing
triangles. This gives rise to twice the unit cell of the kagom\'e lattice,
hence a more interesting topological magnon effects. In particular, the
triangular bridges on the star lattice can be coupled either ferromagnetically
or antiferromagnetically which is not possible on the kagome lattice
ferromagnets. Here, we study DM-induced topological magnon bands, chiral edge

different parameter regimes. The star lattice can also be visualized as the
parent material from which topological magnon bands can be realized for the
kagom\'e and honeycomb lattices in some limiting cases.

emission from the lobes of the radio galaxy Fornax A using 6.1 years of Pass 8
data. After Centaurus A, this is now the second example of an extended
gamma-ray source attributed to a radio galaxy. Both an extended flat disk
morphology and a morphology following the extended radio lobes were preferred
over a point-source description, and the core contribution was constrained to
be < 14% of the total gamma-ray flux. A preferred alignment of the gamma-ray
elongation with the radio lobes was demonstrated by rotating the radio lobes
template. We found no significant evidence for variability on ~0.5 year
timescales. Taken together, these results strongly suggest a lobe origin for
the gamma rays. With the extended nature of the > 100 MeV gamma-ray emission
established, we model the source broadband emission considering currently
available total lobe radio and millimeter flux measurements, as well as X-ray
detections attributed to inverse Compton (IC) emission off the cosmic microwave
background (CMB). Unlike the Centaurus A case, we find that a leptonic model
involving IC scattering of CMB and extragalactic background light (EBL) photons
underpredicts the gamma-ray fluxes by factors of about ~ 2 - 3, depending on
the EBL model adopted. An additional gamma-ray spectral component is thus
required, and could be due to hadronic emission arising from proton-proton
collisions of cosmic rays with thermal plasma within the radio lobes.

perturbation on comoving slices, $\R_c$, on super-horizon scales is one of the
assumptions necessary to derive the consistency condition between the squeezed
limit of the bispectrum and the spectrum of the primordial curvature
perturbation. However, the conservation of $\R_c$ holds only after the
perturbation has reached the adiabatic limit where the constant mode of $\R_c$
dominates over the other (usually decaying) mode. In this case, the
non-adiabatic pressure perturbation defined in the thermodynamic sense, $\delta
P_{nad}\equiv\delta P-c_w^2\delta\rho$ where $c_w^2=\dot P/\dot\rho$, usually
becomes also negligible on superhorizon scales. Therefore one might think that
the adiabatic limit is the same as thermodynamic adiabaticity. This is in fact
not true. In other words, thermodynamic adiabaticity is not a sufficient
condition for the conservation of $\R_c$ on super-horizon scales. In this
paper, we consider models that satisfy $\delta P_{nad}=0$ on all scales, which
we call global adiabaticity (GA), which is guaranteed if $c_w^2=c_s^2$, where
$c_s$ is the phase velocity of the propagation of the perturbation. A known
example is the case of ultra-slow-roll(USR) inflation in which $c_w^2=c_s^2=1$.
In order to generalize USR we develop a method to find the Lagrangian of GA
K-inflation models from the behavior of background quantities as functions of
the scale factor. Applying this method we show that there indeed exists a wide
class of GA models with $c_w^2=c_s^2$, which allows $\R_c$ to grow on
superhorizon scales, and hence violates the non-Gaussianity consistency
condition.

asymmetric information. Since asymmetric information makes people tempted to
misreport their private information for their own benefit, it is of primary
importance to understand whether time pressure affects honest behavior. A
theory of social heuristics (the Social Heuristics Hypothesis, SHH), predicts
that, in case of one-shot interactions, such an effect exists and it is
positive. The SHH proposes that when people have no time to evaluate all
available alternatives, they tend to rely on heuristics, choices that are
optimal in everyday, repeated interactions and that have been internalized over
time; and then, after deliberation, people shift their behavior towards the one
that is optimal in the given interaction. Thus, the SHH predicts that time
pressure increases honesty in one-shot interactions (because honesty may be
optimal in repeated interactions, while dishonesty is always optimal in the
short run). However, to the best of our knowledge, no experimental studies have
tested this prediction. Here, I report a large (N=1,013) study aimed at filling
this gap. In this study, participants were given a private information and were
asked to report it within 5 seconds vs after 30 seconds. The interaction was
one-shot, and payoffs were such that subjects had an incentive to lie. As
predicted by the SHH, I find that time pressure increases honest behavior. In
doing so, these results provide new insights on the role of time pressure on
honesty, and provide one more piece of evidence in support of the Social
Heuristics Hypothesis.

This mass transfer was previously postulated to be unstable and was expected to
lead to a common envelope event. The common envelope event then would end with
either double black hole formation, or with the merger of the two stars. We
re-visit the stability of this mass transfer, and find that for a large range
of the binary orbital separations this mass transfer is stable. This newly

empirical rate obtained by LIGO. Futhermore, the stability of the mass transfer
leads to the formation of ultra-luminous X-ray sources. The theoretically

end with one of three different outcomes -- merger, slow spiral-in, or prompt
formation of a binary. To understand which physical processes determine
different outcomes, and to evaluate how well 1D simulations model the
self-regulated phase of a CEE, we introduce tools that map our 3D models to 1D

redistribution in 1D and 3D codes. We identified four types of ejection
processes: the pre-plunge-in ejection, the outflow during the plunge-in, the
outflow driven by recombination, and the ejection triggered by a contraction of
the circumbinary envelope. Significant mass is lost in all cases, including the
mergers. Therefore a self-regulated spiral-in can start only with a strongly
reduced envelope mass. We derive the condition to start a recombination
outflow, which can proceed either as a runaway or a stationary outflow. We show
that the way the energy of the inspiraling companion is added to the envelope
in 1D studies intensifies the envelope's entropy increase, alters the start of
the recombination outflow, and leads to different outcomes in 1D and 3D
studies. The steady recombination outflow may dispel most of the envelope in
all slow spiral-in cases, making the existence of a long-term self-regulated

published by M. Frazier and B. Jawerth in the eighties have influenced
subsequent developments related to the theory of atomic decompositions and
Banach frames for function spaces such as the modulation spaces and
Besov-Triebel-Lizorkin spaces.
  Both of these classes of spaces arise as special cases of two different,
general constructions of function spaces: coorbit spaces and decomposition
spaces. Coorbit spaces are defined by imposing certain decay conditions on the
so-called voice transform of the function/distribution under consideration. As
a concrete example, one might think of the wavelet transform, leading to the
theory of Besov-Triebel-Lizorkin spaces.
  Decomposition spaces, on the other hand, are defined using certain
decompositions in the Fourier domain. For Besov-Triebel-Lizorkin spaces, one
uses a dyadic decomposition, while a uniform decomposition yields modulation
spaces.
  Only recently, the second author has established a fruitful connection
between modern variants of wavelet theory with respect to general dilation
groups (which can be treated in the context of coorbit theory) and a particular
family of decomposition spaces. In this way, optimal inclusion results and
invariance properties for a variety of smoothness spaces can be established. We
will present an outline of these connections and comment on the basic results
arising in this context.

expected to amplify observable atomic electric dipole moments (EDMs) that arise
from time-reversal and parity-violating interactions in the nuclear medium. In
2015, we reported the first ""proof-of-principle"" measurement of the $^{225}$Ra
atomic EDM. Purpose: This work reports on the first of several experimental
upgrades to improve the statistical sensitivity of our $^{225}$Ra EDM
measurements by orders of magnitude and evaluates systematic effects that
contribute to current and future levels of experimental sensitivity. Method:
Laser-cooled and trapped $^{225}$Ra atoms are held between two high voltage
electrodes in an ultra high vacuum chamber at the center of a magnetically
shielded environment. We observe Larmor precession in a uniform magnetic field
using nuclear-spin-dependent laser light scattering and look for a phase shift
proportional to the applied electric field, which indicates the existence of an
EDM. The main improvement to our measurement technique is an order of magnitude
increase in spin precession time, which is enabled by an improved vacuum system
and a reduction in trap-induced heating. Results: We have measured the
$^{225}$Ra atomic EDM to be less than $1.4\times10^{-23}$ $e$ cm (95%
confidence upper limit), which is a factor of 36 improvement over our previous
result. Conclusions: Our evaluation of systematic effects shows that this
measurement is completely limited by statistical uncertainty. Combining this
measurement technique with planned experimental upgrades we project a
statistical sensitivity at the $1\times10^{-28}$ $e$ cm level and a total
systematic uncertainty at the $4\times10^{-29}$ $e$ cm level.

invariants can diverge. However, such events can occur only for very exotic
equations of state when pressure or derivatives of energy density with respect
to triads become infinite at a finite energy density. In all other cases
curvature invariants are proved to remain finite for any evolution in finite
proper time. We find the novel result that all strong singularities are
resolved for arbitrary matter. Weak singularities pertaining to above potential
curvature divergence events can exist. The effective spacetime is found to be
geodesically complete for particle and null geodesics in finite time evolution.

representation for encoding the data to be transmitted in a wireless network.
This RBN encoding uses three possible values - 0, 1 and $\bar 1$, for each
digit to be transmitted. We then propose to use silent periods (zero energy
transmission) for transmitting the 0's in the RBN encoded data thus obtained.
This is in contrast to most conventional communication strategies that utilize
energy based transmission (EbT) schemes, where energy expenditure occurs for
transmitting both 0 and 1 bit values. The binary to RBN conversion algorithm
presented here offers a significant reduction in the number of non-zero bits in
the resulting RBN encoded data. As a result, it provides a highly
energy-efficient technique for data transmission with silent periods for
transmitting 0's. We simulated our proposed technique with ideal radio device
characteristics and also with parameters of various commercially available
radio devices. Experimental results on various benchmark suites show that with
ideal as well as some commercial device characteristics, our proposed
transmission scheme requires 69% less energy on an average, compared to the
energy based transmission schemes. This makes it very attractive for
application scenarios where the devices are highly energy constrained. Finally,
based on this transmission strategy, we have designed a MAC protocol that would
support the communication of such RBN encoded data frames.

conductivity measurements indicate the presence of nodes in the superconducting
gap structure of Sr2RuO4. Theoretical scenarios have been proposed to account
for the existence of accidental nodes or deep accidental minima within a p-wave
state. To elucidate the nodal structure of the gap, it is essential to know
whether the lines of nodes (or minima) are vertical (parallel to the tetragonal
c axis) or horizontal (perpendicular to the c axis). Here, we report thermal
conductivity measurements on single crystals of Sr2RuO4 down to 50 mK for
currents parallel and perpendicular to the c axis. We find that there is
substantial quasiparticle transport in the T = 0 limit for both current
directions. A magnetic field H immediately excites quasiparticles with
velocities both in the basal plane and in the c direction. Our data down to
Tc/30 and down to Hc/100 show no evidence that the nodes are in fact deep
minima. Relative to the normal state, the thermal conductivity of the
superconducting state is found to be very similar for the two current
directions, from H = 0 to H = Hc2. These findings show that the gap structure
of Sr2RuO4 consists of vertical line nodes. Given that the c-axis dispersion
(warping) of the Fermi surface in Sr2RuO4 varies strongly from surface to
surface, the small a-c anisotropy suggests that the line nodes are present on
all three sheets of the Fermi surface. If imposed by symmetry, vertical line
nodes would be inconsistent with a p-wave order parameter for Sr2RuO4. To
reconcile the gap structure revealed by our data with a p-wave state, a
mechanism must be found that produces accidental line nodes in Sr2RuO4.

three magnetic phase transitions or distinct cross-over phenomena. For
$T<T_{N}$ neutron diffraction indicates the development of ferromagnetic ab
sheets for both Ce sites, with alternating polarization along $\bf{c}$, a wave
vector ${\bf k}_{1}={\bf c}^*$. For $T<T_{2}$, quasi-two-dimensional low-energy
spin fluctuations with ${\bf k}_{2}=\frac{1}{2}{\bf a}^*$ and polarized
perpendicular to ${\bf k}_{2}$ are suppressed. The data are consistent with
quasi-two-dimensional antiferromagnetic order in the $\rm CeCu_4As_4$ planes
polarized along the ${\bf k}_{2}$ wave vector. $T_{3}$ marks a spin-flop
transition where the ${\bf k}_{1}$ staggered magnetization switches to in-plane
polarization. While the narrow 4f bands lie deep below the Fermi surface, there
are significant transport anomalies associated with the transitions; in
particular a substantial reduction in resistivity for $T<T_{N}$. At $T=100$ $
\rm mK$ the ${\bf k}_1$ modulated staggered moment is $0.85~\mu_B$, which
matches the $0.8~\mu_B$ saturation magnetization achieved for H $~=~7$ $ \rm T$
at $T~=~2$ $ \rm K$. From low T Lorentzian fits the correlation length is in
excess of 75 \AA. We argue the unusual sequence of magnetic transitions results
from competing interactions and anisotropies for the two Ce sites.

  suggested by referees; accepted at SIAM J Discrete Math",,,,"math.CO math.MG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  To every poset P, Stanley (1986) associated two polytopes, the order polytope
and the chain polytope, whose geometric properties reflect the combinatorial
qualities of P. This construction allows for deep insights into combinatorics
by way of geometry and vice versa. Malvenuto and Reutenauer (2011) introduced
'double posets', that is, (finite) sets equipped with two partial orders, as a
generalization of Stanley's labelled posets. Many combinatorial constructions
can be naturally phrased in terms of double posets. We introduce the 'double
order polytope' and the 'double chain polytope' and we amply demonstrate that
they geometrically capture double posets, i.e., the interaction between the two
partial orders. We describe the facial structures, Ehrhart polynomials, and
volumes of these polytopes in terms of the combinatorics of double posets. We
also describe a curious connection to Geissinger's valuation polytopes and we
characterize 2-level polytopes among our double poset polytopes.
  Fulkerson's 'anti-blocking' polytopes from combinatorial optimization subsume
stable set polytopes of graphs and chain polytopes of posets. We determine the
geometry of Minkowski- and Cayley sums of anti-blocking polytopes. In
particular, we describe a canonical subdivision of Minkowski sums of
anti-blocking polytopes that facilitates the computation of Ehrhart
(quasi-)polynomials and volumes. This also yields canonical triangulations of
double poset polytopes.
  Finally, we investigate the affine semigroup rings associated to double poset
polytopes. We show that they have quadratic Groebner bases, which gives an
algebraic description of the unimodular flag triangulations described in the
first part.

Remembering that $(1+1)$-dimensional perfect black-body emitters are

in their entropy emission properties, $(3+1)$-dimensional Schwarzschild black

wonders whether all black holes behave as simple $(1+1)$-dimensional entropy

perturbations that low-mass dark matter subhaloes impart on stellar streams
from disrupting Galactic satellites. In anticipation of these observations, we
investigate the expected number and size of gaps by combining an analytic
prescription for gap evolution on circular orbits with the flux of subhaloes
near the stream. We explore the distribution of gap sizes and depths for a
typical cold stream around the Milky Way and find that for a given stream age
and gap depth, each subhalo mass produces a characteristic gap size. For a
stream with an age of a few Gyr, orbiting at a distance of 10-20 kpc from the
Galactic center, even modest subhaloes with a mass of $10^6-10^7 M_\odot$
produce gaps with sizes that are on the order of several degrees. We consider
the number and distribution of gap sizes created by subhaloes with masses
$10^5-10^9 M_\odot$, accounting for the expected depletion of subhaloes by the

through the LMXB channel with emphasis on the proto-WD evolution in
environments with different metallicities. We study, for the first time, the
combined effects of rotational mixing and element diffusion (e.g. gravitational
settling, thermal and chemical diffusion) on the evolution of proto-WDs and on
the cooling properties of the resulting WDs. We present state-of-the-art binary
stellar evolution models computed with MESA for metallicities between Z=0.0002
and Z=0.02, producing WDs with masses between 0.16-0.45 M$_{\odot}$. Our
results confirm that element diffusion plays a significant role in the
evolution of proto-WDs that experience hydrogen shell flashes. The occurrence
of these flashes produces a clear dichotomy in the cooling timescales of ELM
WDs, which has important consequences e.g. for the age determination of binary
millisecond pulsars. Rotational mixing is found to counteract the effect of
gravitational settling in the surface layers of young, bloated ELM proto-WDs
and therefore plays a key role in determining their surface chemical
abundances. We predict that these proto-WDs have helium-rich envelopes through
a significant part of their lifetime, a crucial ingredient for understanding
the newly observed ELM proto-WD pulsators. The hydrogen envelope at detachment,
although small compared to the total mass of the WD, contains enough angular
momentum such that the spin frequency of the resulting WD on the cooling track
is well above the orbital frequency.

($\sim880$ $arcmin^2$), which we divide into four main morphological types,
i.e. pure bulge dominated systems, pure spiral disk dominated, intermediate
2-component bulge+disk systems and irregular disturbed galaxies. Our main
results are:
  Star-formation: At $z\sim 2$, 80\% of the stellar mass density of
star-forming galaxies is in irregular systems. However, by $z\sim 0.5$,
irregular objects only dominate at stellar masses below $10^9M\odot$. A
majority of the star-forming irregulars present at $z\sim 2$ undergo a gradual
transformation from disturbed to normal spiral disk morphologies by $z\sim 1$
without significant interruption to their star-formation. Rejuvenation after a
quenching event does not seem to be common except perhaps for the most massive
objects.
  Quenching: We confirm that galaxies reaching a stellar mass of
$M_*\sim10^{10.8}M_\odot$ ($M^*$) tend to quench. Also, quenching implies the
presence of a bulge: the abundance of massive red disks is negligible at all
redshifts over 2~dex in stellar mass. However the dominant quenching mechanism
evolves. At $z>2$, the SMF of quiescent galaxies above $M^*$ is dominated by
compact spheroids. Quenching at this early epoch destroys the disk and produces
a compact remnant unless the star-forming progenitors at even higher redshifts
are significantly more dense. At $1<z<2$, the majority of newly quenched
galaxies are disks with a significant central bulge. This suggests that
mass-quenching at this epoch starts from the inner parts and preserves the
disk. At $z<1$, the high mass end of the passive SMF is globally in place and
the evolution mostly happens at stellar masses below $10^{10}M_\odot$.

coolest X-ray emitting phase and connects the 10,000 K H {\alpha} emitting gas
to the million degree phase, providing a useful tool to understand cooling in
these objects. We study the location of the O VII gas and its connection to the
intermediate Fe XVII and hotter O VIII phases. We use high-resolution X-ray
grating spectra of elliptical galaxies with strong Fe XVII line emission and
detect O VII in 11 of 24 objects. Comparing the O VII detection level and
resonant scattering, which is sensitive to turbulence and temperature, suggests
that OVII is preferably found in cooler objects, where the FeXVII resonant line
is suppressed due to resonant scattering, indicating subsonic turbulence.
Although a larger sample of sources and further observations is needed to
distinguish between effects from temperature and turbulence, our results are
consistent with cooling being suppressed at high turbulence as predicted by
models of AGN feedback, gas sloshing and galactic mergers. In some objects the
OVII resonant-to-forbidden line ratio is decreased by either resonant
scattering or charge-exchange boosting the forbidden line, as we show for NGC
4636. Charge-exchange indicates interaction between neutral and ionized gas
phases. The Perseus cluster also shows a high Fe XVII forbidden-to- resonance
line ratio, which can be explained with resonant scattering by low-turbulence
cool gas in the line-of-sight.

the flux it had in the ROSAT all-sky survey, and confirmed with Swift follow-up
after increasing in X-ray flux by a factor of 30. Optical spectroscopy with
SALT shows that the AGN has changed from a Seyfert 1.95 to a Seyfert 1.5
galaxy, with greatly increased broad line emission and an increase in blue
continuum AGN flux by a factor of > 4. The X-ray spectra from XMM-Newton and
NuSTAR reveal moderate intrinsic absorption and a high energy cutoff at 100

changes in obscuring material, tidal disruption events, and an increase in the
accretion rate. We find that the most likely cause of the increased flux is an
increase in the accretion rate, although it could also be due to a change in
obscuration.

the skill of the decision-maker, the time available to make the decision, and
the inherent difficulty of the decision. We identify rich structure in all

In this paper we describe the evolution of the spectrum and the P Cygni
profiles for three months past maximum, the post-maximum formation of a cool,
dense wind, and the identification of a possible progenitor. One of the
possible progenitors is an infrared source. Its pre-eruption spectral energy
distribution suggests a bolometric luminosity of -8.3 mag and a dust
temperature of 780 degrees K. If it is the progenitor it is above the AGB limit
unlike the intermediate luminosity red transients. The three P Cygni profiles
could be due to ejecta from the current eruption, the wind of the progenitor,
or previous mass loss events. We suggest that they were all formed as part of
the same high mass loss event and are due to material ejected at different

parity-time ($\mathcal{PT}$)-symmetric systems, exhibit properties that are
absent in closed, isolated systems. A key property is the
$\mathcal{PT}$-symmetry breaking transition, which occurs when the gain-loss
strength, a measure of the openness of the system, exceeds the intrinsic
energy-scale of the system. We analyze the fate of this transition in
disordered lattices with non-Hermitian gain and loss potentials $\pm i\gamma$
at reflection-symmetric sites. Contrary to the popular belief, we show that the
$\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric phase is protected in the presence of a correlated
(periodic) disorder which leads to a positive $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetry breaking
threshold. We uncover a veiled symmetry of such disordered systems that is
instrumental for the said protection, and show that this symmetry leads to new
localization behavior across the $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetry breaking transition.
We elucidate the interplay between such localization and the
$\mathcal{PT}$-symmetry breaking phenomena in disordered
$\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric lattices, and support our conclusions with a
beam-propagation-method analysis. Our theoretical predictions provide avenues

predictions of lepton avour models based on (discrete) symmetries, except for
the very few cases which unambiguously predict the full set of leptonic mixing
angles. A subclass of these correlations are neutrino mass sum rules, which
connect the three (complex) light neutrino mass eigenvalues among each other.
This connection constrains both the light neutrino mass scale and the Majorana
phases, so that mass sum rules generically lead to a nonzero value of the
lightest neutrino mass and to distinct predictions for the e ective mass probed
in neutrinoless double beta decay. However, in nearly all cases known, the
neutrino mass sum rules are not exact and receive corrections from various
sources. We introduce a formalism to handle these corrections perturbatively in
a model-independent manner, which overcomes issues present in earlier
approaches. Our ansatz allows us to quantify the modi cation of the predictions
derived from neutrino mass sum rules. We show that, in most cases, the
predictions are fairly stable: while small quantitative changes can appear,
they are generally rather mild. We therefore establish the predictivity of
neutrino mass sum rules on a level far more general than previously known.

considered to be a dominant coolant in the interstellar medium. For this
reason, under the assumption of a thermal steady state, it may be used to infer
the heating rate and, in turn, the star formation rate in local, as well as in
high redshift systems. In this work, radio and ultraviolet observations of the
Galactic interstellar medium are used to understand whether C II is indeed a
good tracer of the star formation rate. For a sample of high Galactic latitude
sightlines, direct measurements of the temperature indicate the presence of C
II in both the cold and the warm phases of the diffuse interstellar gas. The
cold gas fraction (~ 10 - 50% of the total neutral gas column density) is not
negligible even at high Galactic latitude. It is shown that, to correctly
estimate the star formation rate, C II cooling in both the phases should hence
be considered. The simple assumption, that the [C II] line originates only from
either the cold or the warm phase, significantly underpredicts or overpredicts
the star formation rate, respectively. These results are particularly important
in the context of the Damped Lyman-alpha systems for which a similar method is
often used to estimate the star formation rate. The derived star formation
rates in such cases may not be reliable if the temperature of the gas under

therefore inconclusive, confidence intervals. The Bayesian intervals on the

injection. We analyze the resulting population of clouds, finding that we can
identify the same population of massive, virialized clouds and transient,
low-surface density clouds found in our previous work (that did not include
star formation or feedback). Star formation and feedback can affect the mix of
clouds we identify. In particular, star formation alone simply converts dense
cloud gas into stars with only a small change to the cloud populations,
principally resulting in a slight decrease in the transient population.
Feedback, however, has a stronger impact: while it is not generally sufficient
to entirely destroy the clouds, it does eject gas out of them, increasing the
gas density in the inter-cloud region. This decreases the number of massive
clouds, but substantially increases the transient cloud population. We also
find that feedback tends to drive a net radial inflow of massive clouds,
leading to an increase in the star formation rate in the bar region. We examine
a number of possible reasons for this and conclude that it is possible that the
drag force from the enhanced intercloud density could be responsible.

call the algorithm random parallel because it utilizes multiple parallel
processors to operate on a randomly chosen subset of blocks of the feature
vector. We call the algorithm stochastic because processors choose training
subsets uniformly at random. Algorithms that are parallel in either of these

parallel in both the selection of blocks and the selection of elements of the
training set. In RAPSA, processors utilize the randomly chosen functions to
compute the stochastic gradient component associated with a randomly chosen
block. The technical contribution of this paper is to show that this minimally
coordinated algorithm converges to the optimal classifier when the training
objective is convex. Moreover, we present an accelerated version of RAPSA
(ARAPSA) that incorporates the objective function curvature information by
premultiplying the descent direction by a Hessian approximation matrix. We
further extend the results for asynchronous settings and show that if the

in the ground state wavefunction of conformally invariant quantum chains, on
periodic lattices, has a leading finite-size scaling behavior that, similarly
as the von Neumann entanglement entropy, depends on the value of the central
charge of the underlying conformal field theory describing the physical
properties. This conjecture applies whenever the ground state wavefunction is
expressed in some special basis (conformal basis). Its formulation comes mainly
from numerical evidences on exactly integrable quantum chains. In this paper
the above conjecture was tested for several general non-integrable quantum
chains. We introduce new families of self-dual $Z(Q)$ symmetric quantum chains
($Q=2,3,\ldots$). These quantum chains contain nearest neighbour as well
next-nearest neighbour interactions (coupling constant $p$). In the cases $Q=2$
and $Q=3$ they are extensions of the standard quantum Ising and 3-state Potts
chains, respectively. For $Q=4$ and $Q\geq 5$ they are extensions of the
Ashkin-Teller and $Z(Q)$ parafermionic quantum chains. Our studies indicate
that these models are interesting on their own. They are critical, conformally
invariant, and share the same universality class in a continuous critical line.
Moreover, our numerical analysis for $Q=2-8$ indicate that the Shannon mutual
information exhibits the conjectured behaviour irrespective if the conformally
invariant quantum chain is exactly integrable or not. For completeness we also
calculated, for these new families of quantum chains, the two existing
generalizations of the Shannon mutual information, which are based on the
R\'enyi entropy and on the R\'enyi divergence.

(CRNs) is to find a common control channel (CCC) to all secondary users (SUs)
that enables efficient CR communications. This challenge is attributed to the
dynamic time-varying change of network topology, location and spectrum
availability conditions. Rendezvous, which is the process of establishing
control communications, is an essential requirement to enable efficient
communication between any two pair of CR nodes. The most popular CR rendezvous
protocols are based on quorum systems (QSs). Quorum systems are systematic
approaches, which have several attractive properties that can be utilized to
establish communication without the need of a CCC and so overcome the
rendezvous (RDV) problem.
  In this thesis, we propose new channel-hopping-based distributed rendezvous
algorithm based on grid-based-quorum techniques. The proposed algorithm
increases the probability of RDV within a single cycle by allowing CR nodes to
meet more often according to intersection property of quorum systems. Our
proposed algorithm is called Adaptive_Quorum-Based Channel-Hopping Distributed
Coordination Scheme for Cognitive Radio Networks. The main idea of our
algorithm is to dynamically adjusting the selected QS by CR users according to
the varying traffic loads in the CRN. The proposed algorithm decreases the
average time to rendezvous (TTR) and increase the probability of RDV. We
evaluate the performance of our algorithm through Matlab simulations. The
performance of proposed algorithm is compared with two different design scheme.
The results show that our algorithm can reduce TTR, increase the RDV, and
decrease the energy consumption per successful RDV.

years due to its purported construction of a middle path between case-oriented

method has been criticized for possibly not distinguishing random from real
patterns in data, rendering its usefulness questionable. Critics of the method
suggest a straightforward technique to test whether QCA will return a
configuration when given random data. We adapt this technique to determine the
probability that a given QCA application would return a random result. This
assessment can be used as a hypothesis test for QCA, with an interpretation
similar to a p-value. Using repeated applications of QCA to randomly-generated
data, we first show that generally, the tendency for QCA to return spurious
results is attenuated by using reasonable consistency score and configurational
N thresholds; however, this varies considerably according to the basic
structure of the data. Second, we suggest an application-specific assessment of
QCA results, illustrated using the case of Tea Party rallies in Florida. This

discrepancy between the baryonic and dynamical mass, which is usually

assuming MOND, some profiles of individual galaxies show discrepancies.

subregions in the temporal, occipital, and lingual cortices. Finally, events
that were both temporally and semantically congruent modulated activity in the

high-level knowledge such as semantics play a role in our coherent perceptual

previously obtained using the linear response theory. In this case, we also
find the higher-order scaled density moments to increase with time and saturate
at values significantly larger than one, which corresponds to a uniform density
distribution, after the phase separation. The skewness of the quark number
event-by-event distribution in a small sub-volume of the system is also found
to increase, but this feature disappears if the sub-volume is large. For the
expanding quark matter, two cases are considered with one using a blast-wave
model for the initial conditions and the other using initial conditions from a
mulple-phase transport (AMPT) model. In both cases, we find the expansion of
the quark matter is slowed down by the presence of a first-order phase
transition. Also, density clumps appear in the system and the momentum
distribution of partons becomes anisotropic , which can be characterized by
large scaled density moments and non-vanishing anisotropic elliptic and
quadrupolar flows, respectively. The large density fluctuations further lead to
an enhancement in the dilepton yield. In the case with the AMPT initial
conditions, the presence of a first-order phase transition also results in a
narrower rapidity distribution of partons after their freeze out. These effects
of density fluctuations can be regarded as possible signals for a first-order
phase transition that occurs in the baryon-rich quark matter formed in

conductivity of CeCoIn$_5$ in a rotating magnetic field, which reveals the
presence of an additional order inside the $Q$ phase that is intimately
intertwined with the superconducting $d$-wave and SDW orders. A discontinuous
change of the thermal conductivity within the $Q$ phase, when the magnetic
field is rotated about antinodes of the superconducting $d$-wave order
parameter, demands that the additional order must change abruptly together with
the recently observed switching of the SDW. A combination of interactions,
where spin-orbit coupling orients the SDW, which then selects the secondary
$p$-wave pair-density-wave component (with an average amplitude of 20\% of the
primary $d$-wave order parameter), accounts for the observed behavior.

J0823.2+0333) through an unusual giant wide-angle tail radio galaxy found in
the Radio Galaxy Zoo project. We obtained a spectroscopic redshift of
$z=0.0897$ for the E0-type host galaxy, 2MASX J08231289+0333016, leading to
M$_r = -22.6$ and a $1.4\,$GHz radio luminosity density of $L_{\rm 1.4} =
5.5\times10^{24}$ W Hz$^{-1}$. These radio and optical luminosities are typical
for wide-angle tailed radio galaxies near the borderline between Fanaroff-Riley
(FR) classes I and II. The projected largest angular size of $\approx8\,$arcmin
corresponds to $800\,$kpc and the full length of the source along the curved
jets/trails is $1.1\,$Mpc in projection. X-ray data from the XMM-Newton archive
yield an upper limit on the X-ray luminosity of the thermal emission
surrounding RGZ J082312.9+033301,at $1.2-2.6\times10^{43}$ erg s$^{-1}$ for
assumed intra-cluster medium temperatures of $1.0-5.0\,$keV. Our analysis of
the environment surrounding RGZ J082312.9+033301 indicates that RGZ
J082312.9+033301 lies within a poor cluster. The observed radio morphology
suggests that (a) the host galaxy is moving at a significant velocity with
respect to an ambient medium like that of at least a poor cluster, and that (b)
the source may have had two ignition events of the active galactic nucleus with
$10^7\,$yrs in between. This reinforces the idea that an association between
RGZ J082312.9+033301, and the newly discovered poor cluster exists.

wireless body area network (WBAN). Human body communication (HBC) provides an
alternate energy-efficient communication technique between on-body wearable
devices by using the human body as a conducting medium. This allows order of
magnitude lower communication power, compared to WBAN, due to lower loss and
broadband signaling. Moreover, HBC is significantly more secure than WBAN, as
the information is contained within the human body and cannot be snooped on
unless the person is physically touched. In this paper, we highlight
applications of HBC as (1) Social Networking (e.g. LinkedIn/Facebook friend

using human-human or human-machine dynamic HBC and (3) ultra-low power, secure
BAN using intra-human HBC. One of the biggest technical bottlenecks of HBC has
been the interference (e.g. FM) picked up by the human body acting like an
antenna. In this work, for the first time, we introduce an integrating dual
data rate (DDR) receiver technique, that allows notch filtering (>20 dB) of the
interference for interference-robust HBC.

as an ensemble of ""tokens"" (molecules, objects, and so on) and is inspired, at
least partially, by biological systems where groups of individually constructed
discrete particles ranging from molecules through membrane-bound structures
containing molecules to viruses and organisms are released by a source and
travel to a target -- for example, morphogens or semiochemicals diffuse from
one cell, tissue or organism diffuse to another. For identical tokens that are
neither lost nor modified, we consider messages encoded using three candidate
communication schemes: a) token timing (timed release), b) token payload
(composition), and c) token timing plus payload. We provide capacity bounds for
each scheme and discuss their relative utility. We find that under not
unreasonable assumptions, megabit per second rates could be supported at
femtoWatt transmitter powers. Since quantities such as token concentration or
bin-counting are derivatives of token arrival timing, individual token timing
undergirds all molecular communication techniques. Thus, our modeling and
results about the physics of efficient token-based information transfer can
inform investigations of diverse theoretical and practical problems in

theoretic bounds on capacity. Part II develops some of the mathematical and

prototypical electron-phonon-coupled system, to calculate the susceptibility

show that, in sharp contrast to the BCS theory, the Higgs mode can contribute
to the third-harmonic generation for general polarization of the laser field

breaking or charge density fluctuations. The physical origin is traced back to
the nonlinear resonant light-Higgs coupling, which has been absent in the BCS

interpretability. Current methods for learning statistical models either
produce models that are not interpretable or have prohibitive computational
costs when applied to massive data. In this paper we address this need by
presenting a scalable algorithm for partial least squares regression (PLS),
which we call compression-based PLS (cPLS), to learn predictive linear models
with a high interpretability from massive high-dimensional data. We propose a
novel grammar-compressed representation of data matrices that supports fast row

data matrix is grammar-compressed and then the linear model in PLS is learned
on the compressed data matrix, which results in a significant reduction in
working space, greatly improving scalability. We experimentally test cPLS on
its ability to learn linear models for classification, regression and feature
extraction with various massive high-dimensional data, and show that cPLS
performs superiorly in terms of prediction accuracy, computational efficiency,

improving the quality of hash codes and hash functions. However, confronted
with the rapid growth of newly-emerging concepts and multimedia data on the
Web, existing supervised hashing approaches may easily suffer from the scarcity
and validity of supervised information due to the expensive cost of manual
labelling. In this paper, we propose a novel hashing scheme, termed
\emph{zero-shot hashing} (ZSH), which compresses images of ""unseen"" categories
to binary codes with hash functions learned from limited training data of
""seen"" categories. Specifically, we project independent data labels i.e.
0/1-form label vectors) into semantic embedding space, where semantic
relationships among all the labels can be precisely characterized and thus seen
supervised knowledge can be transferred to unseen classes. Moreover, in order
to cope with the semantic shift problem, we rotate the embedded space to more
suitably align the embedded semantics with the low-level visual feature space,
thereby alleviating the influence of semantic gap. In the meantime, to exert
positive effects on learning high-quality hash functions, we further propose to
preserve local structural property and discrete nature in binary codes.
Besides, we develop an efficient alternating algorithm to solve the ZSH model.
Extensive experiments conducted on various real-life datasets show the superior
zero-shot image retrieval performance of ZSH as compared to several
state-of-the-art hashing methods.

two of the fundamental problems faced by any content dissemination system:

  We consider a multi-tiered, multi-domain hierarchical system wherein random

towards custodians versus opportunistic exploration of replicas in a given

for content placement. We propose an analytical model to study the interplay
between search and placement. The model yields closed form expressions for
metrics of interest such as the average delay experienced by users and the load
placed on custodians. Then, leveraging the model solution we pose a joint
placement-search optimization problem. We show that previously proposed
strategies for optimal placement, such as the square-root allocation, follow as
special cases of ours, and that a bang-bang search policy is optimal if content

the RMS surface height fluctuations, $\eta$, peak near the boundaries of the

experiments, a dominant peak in the spectrum of $\partial\eta/\partial t$ is
found at the dimensionless frequency $fH/U\approx 0.7$. In the suddenly started

sub-surface turbulence within the boundary layer, while ripples propagate
freely when farther from the belt. Additionally, some mechanisms for air
entrainment are observed and comparisons are made to predictions of incipient

maximum-likelihood (ML) estimator are derived for a radar with $M_t$ arrays of
$L_t$ transmitting elements and $M_r$ arrays of $L_r$ receiving elements for
both types of signal models.
  It is shown that for an infinitely large product $M_tM_r$, and a finite
$L_r$, the ML estimator is consistent and efficient under the stochastic model,
while the deterministic model requires $M_tM_r$ to be finite and $L_r$ to be
infinitely large in order to guarantee consistency and efficiency.
  Monte Carlo simulations further investigate the estimation performance of the
proposed radar configuration in practical scenarios with finite $M_tM_r$ and
$L_r$, and a fixed total number of available receiving antenna elements, $M_r
L_r$. The numerical results demonstrate that grouping receiving elements into
properly sized arrays reduces the mean squared error (MSE) and decreases the
threshold SNR. In the numerical examples considered, the preferred
configurations employ $M_t M_r > 1$. In fact, when $M_t M_r$ becomes too small,
due to the loss of the geometric gain, the estimation performance becomes
strongly dependent on the particular scenario and can degrade significantly,
while the CRLB may become a poor prediction of the MSE even for high SNR. This
suggests it may be advantageous to employ approaches where neither $M_tM_r$ nor
$L_r$ are too small.

are unknown, the filtering problem is known to be a challenging problem. This
paper attempts to make progress on this problem by proposing a new class of
filtering methods in bounded noise setting via set-membership theory and Monte
Carlo (boundary) sampling technique, called Monte Carlo set-membership filter.
The set-membership prediction and measurement update are derived by recent
convex optimization methods based on S-procedure and Schur complement. To
guarantee the on-line usage, the nonlinear dynamics are linearized about the
current estimate and the remainder terms are then bounded by an optimization
ellipsoid, which can be described as a semi-infinite optimization problem. In
general, it is an analytically intractable problem when dynamic systems are
nonlinear. However, for a typical nonlinear dynamic system in target tracking,
we can analytically derive some regular properties for the remainder. Moreover,
based on the remainder properties and the inverse function theorem, the
semi-infinite optimization problem can be efficiently solved by Monte Carlo
boundary sampling technique. Compared with the particle filter, numerical
examples show that when the probability density functions of noises are
unknown, the performance of the Monte Carlo set-membership filter is better
than that of the particle filter.

must be contained within national boundaries. Indeed, some paths experience
international detours, i.e., originate in one country, cross international

traffic engineering or peering decisions at ISPs that serve multiple countries.
In some cases such detours may be suspicious. Characterizing international
detours is useful to a number of players: (a) network engineers trying to
diagnose persistent problems, (b) policy makers aiming at adhering to certain
national communication policies, (c) entrepreneurs looking for opportunities to
deploy new networks, or (d) privacy-conscious states trying to minimize the
amount of internal communication traversing different jurisdictions. In this
paper we characterize international detours in the Internet during the month of
January 2016. To detect detours we sample BGP RIBs every 8 hours from 461
RouteViews and RIPE RIS peers spanning 30 countries. Then geolocate visible
ASes by geolocating each BGP prefix announced by each AS, mapping its presence
at IXPs and geolocation infrastructure IPs. Finally, analyze each global BGP
RIB entry looking for detours. Our analysis shows more than 5K unique BGP
prefixes experienced a detour. A few ASes cause most detours and a small
fraction of prefixes were affected the most. We observe about 544K detours.
Detours either last for a few days or persist the entire month. Out of all the
detours, more than 90% were transient detours that lasted for 72 hours or less.
We also show different countries experience different characteristics of
detours.

return the same ground state energy in the thermodynamic limit, but not the

$\rho(r,N)$ of edge states in HAFs with $S = 1$, 3/2 and 2. The edge states are
boundary-induced spin density waves (BI-SDWs) with $\rho(r,N)\propto(-1)^{r-1}$
for $r=1,2,\ldots N$. The SDWs are in phase when N is odd, out of phase when N
is even, and have finite excitation energy $\Gamma(N)$ that decreases
exponentially with N for integer $S$ and faster than 1/N for half integer $S$.
The spin densities and excitation energy are quantitatively modeled for integer
$S$ chains longer than $5 \xi$ spins by two parameters, the correlation length
$\xi$ and the SDW amplitude, with $\xi = 6.048$ for $S = 1$ and 49.0 for $S =
2$. The BI-SDWs of $S = 3/2$ chains are not localized and are qualitatively
different for even and odd N. Exchange between the ends for odd N is mediated
by a delocalized effective spin in the middle that increases $|\Gamma(N)|$ and
weakens the size dependence. The nonlinear sigma model (NL$\sigma$M) has been
applied the HAFs, primarily to $S = 1$ with even N, to discuss spin densities

analysis of aggregate and population-specific data to extract the common trend
and population-specific residual trend among populations. If the forecasts of
population-specific residual trends do not show a long-term trend, then
convergence in forecasts may be achieved. This method is first applied to age-
and sex-specific data for the United Kingdom, and its forecast accuracy is then
further compared with several existing methods, including independent
functional data and product-ratio methods, through a multi-country comparison.
The proposed method is also demonstrated by age-, sex- and state-specific data
in Australia, where the convergence in forecasts can possibly be achieved by
sex and state. For forecasting age-specific mortality, the multilevel
functional data method is more accurate than the other coherent methods
considered. For forecasting female life expectancy at birth, the multilevel
functional data method is outperformed by the Bayesian method of \cite{RLG14}.
For forecasting male life expectancy at birth, the multilevel functional data
method performs better than the Bayesian methods in terms of point forecasts,
but less well in terms of interval forecasts. Supplementary materials for this

charge---aggregates of matter due to a neutrino-pair exchange, in the limit of

potential comes from the coherent scattering amplitude at low values of t. This
amplitude is obtained using the methodology of an unsubtracted dispersion
relation in t at threshold for s, where (s, t) are the Lorentz invariant
scattering variables. The ultraviolet behavior is irrelevant for the long-range
force. In turn, the absorptive part in the t-dependence is given by the
corresponding unitarity relation. We show that the potential describing this
force decreases as $r^{-5}$ at large separation distance r. This interaction is
described in terms of its own charge, which we call the weak flavor charge of
the interacting systems, that depends on the flavor of the neutrino as $Q_W^e =
2Z-N$, $Q_W^\mu = Q_W^\tau = -N$. The flavor dependence of the potential
factorizes in the product of the weak charges of the interacting systems, so
that the resulting force is always repulsive. Furthermore, this charge is
proportional to the number of constituent particles, which differs from the
global mass, so this interaction could be disentangled from gravitation through
deviations from the Equivalence Principle.

sensitivities. However, realizing this potential requires the development of
techniques for retrieving sample moments from magnetic microscopy data. With
this goal, we developed a technique for uniquely obtaining the net magnetic
moment of geological samples from magnetic microscopy maps of unresolved or
nearly unresolved magnetization. This technique is particularly powerful for
analyzing small, weakly magnetized samples such as meteoritic chondrules and
terrestrial silicate crystals like zircons. We validated this technique by

metrics possess translation and rotation isometries in addition to scaling
isometries for the inverse-square potential with zero energy E. The geodesic
flow on the full configuration space $C^3$ (with collision points excluded)
leads to corresponding flows on its Riemannian quotients: the center of mass
configuration space $C^2$ and shape space $R^3$ (as well as $S^3$ and the shape

Riemannian submersions are described explicitly in `Hopf' coordinates which are
particularly adapted to the isometries. For equal masses subject to
inverse-square potentials, Montgomery shows that the zero-energy `pair of

gaussian curvature except at Lagrange points. We extend this to a proof of
boundedness and strict negativity of scalar curvatures everywhere on $C^2, R^3$

shown that the LSF substantially modify the bonding and interatomic

atomic short-range order (SRO) is in reasonable agreement with existing

found for the Fe0.75Cr0.17Ni0.08 alloy composition, which approximately
corresponds to the widely used 304 and 316 austenitic steel grades.

polycrystalline samples of the series Ba$_{2-x}$Sr$_x$YIrO$_6$ no indication of
magnetic transitions have been found. We present a structural, magnetic and
thermodynamic characterization of Sr$_2$YIrO$_6$ single crystals, with emphasis
on the temperature and magnetic field dependence of the specific heat. Here, we
demonstrate the clue role of single crystal X-ray diffraction on the structural
characterization of the Sr$_2$YIrO$_6$ double perovskite crystals by reporting
the detection of a $\sqrt{2}a \times \sqrt{2}a \times 1c$ supercell, where $a$,
$b$ and $c$ are the unit cell dimensions of the reported monoclinic subcell. In
agreement with the expected non-magnetic ground state of Ir$^{5+}$ (5d$^4$) in

our results suggest that the low temperature anomaly observed in the specific
heat is not related to the onset of long-range magnetic order. Instead, it is
identified as a Schottky anomaly caused by paramagnetic impurities present in
the sample, of the order of $n \sim 0.5(2)$ \%. These impurities lead to
non-negligible spin correlations, which nonetheless, are not associated with
long-range magnetic ordering.

algorithm is incorporated, estimation is via a Gibbs sampling algorithm and an
approximate BIC-MCMC criterion is developed to select the optimal model.

small subset of variables is deemed discriminatory which notably includes
phenotypic and genotypic variables, highlighting the need to jointly consider
both factors. Further, seven years after the LIPGENE-SU.VI.MAX data were
collected, participants underwent further analysis to diagnose presence or

the observed increase of near surface temperatures over the second half of the
twentieth century is attributed to anthropogenic influences. However, the
partitioning of the anthropogenic influence to individual factors, such as
greenhouse gases and aerosols, is much less robust. Differences in how forcing
factors are applied, in their radiative influence and in models' climate
sensitivities, substantially influence the response patterns. We find standard
optimal detection methodologies cannot fully reconcile this response diversity.
By selecting a set of experiments to enable the diagnosing of greenhouse gases
and the combined influence of other anthropogenic and natural factors, we find
robust detections of well mixed greenhouse gases across a large ensemble of
models. Of the observed warming over the 20th century of 0.65K/century we find,
using a multi model mean not incorporating pattern uncertainty, a well mixed
greenhouse gas warming of 0.87 to 1.22K/century. This is partially offset by
cooling from other anthropogenic and natural influences of -0.54 to
-0.22K/century. Although better constrained than recent studies, the
attributable trends across climate models are still wide, with implications for
observational constrained estimates of transient climate response. Some of the
uncertainties could be reduced in future by having more model data to better
quantify the simulated estimates of the signals and natural variability, by
designing model experiments more effectively and better quantification of the
climate model radiative influences. Most importantly, how model pattern
uncertainties are incorporated into the optimal detection methodology should be
improved.

for variational regularization. After solving the standard variational problem,
the key idea is to add a consecutive debiasing step minimizing the data
fidelity on an appropriate set, the so-called model manifold. The latter is
defined by Bregman distances or infimal convolutions thereof, using the
(uniquely defined) subgradient appearing in the optimality condition of the
variational method. For particular settings, such as anisotropic $\ell^1$ and
TV-type regularization, previously used debiasing techniques are shown to be
special cases. The proposed approach is however easily applicable to a wider
range of regularizations. The two-step debiasing is shown to be well-defined
and to optimally reduce bias in a certain setting.
  In addition to visual and PSNR-based evaluations, different notions of bias
and variance decompositions are investigated in numerical studies. The
improvements offered by the proposed scheme are demonstrated and its
performance is shown to be comparable to optimal results obtained with Bregman

some black hole spacetimes describable by a system of finite degrees of
freedom. These systems are generally known as minisuperspace models. One of
their important key features is the invariance of the corresponding reduced
actions under reparametrizations of the independent variable, a fact that can
be seen as the remnant of the general covariance of the full theory. In the
case of a system of $n$ degrees of freedom, described by a Lagrangian quadratic
in velocities, one can use the lapse by either gauge fixing it or letting it be
defined by the constraint and subsequently substitute into the rest of the
equations. In the first case, the system is solvable for $n$ accelerations and
the constraint becomes a restriction among constants. In the second case, the
system can only be solved for $n-1$ accelerations and the ""gauge"" freedom is
transferred to the choice of one of the scalar degrees of freedom. In this
paper, we take the second path and express all $n-1$ scalar degrees of freedom
in terms of the remaining one, say $q$. By considering these $n-1$ degrees of
freedom as arbitrary but given functions of $q$, we manage to extract a two
dimensional pure gauge system consisting of the lapse $N$ and the arbitrary
$q$: in a way, we decouple the reparametrization invariance from the rest of
the equations of motion. The solution of the corresponding quantum two
dimensional system is used for the definition of a generalized probability for
every configuration $f^i (q)$, be it classical or not. The main result is that,
interestingly enough, this probability attains its extrema on the classical
solution of the initial $n$-dimensional system.

close to zero, indicating that the original accelerated electron energy
spectrum is much harder than commonly thought, with power-law index around 1.5

exhibit a variety of shapes. For a small set of low-z sources, we find a
spectral upturn at high frequencies, indicating the presence of intrinsic cold

the art by incorporating reasoning about data association (DA) within planning,
while considering additional sources of uncertainty. Existing BSP approaches
typically assume data association is given and perfect, an assumption that can
be harder to justify while operating, in the presence of localization
uncertainty, in ambiguous and perceptually aliased environments. In contrast,
our data association aware belief space planning (DA-BSP) approach explicitly
reasons about DA within belief evolution, and as such can better accommodate
these challenging real world scenarios. In particular, we show that due to
perceptual aliasing, the posterior belief becomes a mixture of probability
distribution functions, and design cost functions that measure the expected
level of ambiguity and posterior uncertainty. Using these and standard costs
(e.g.~control penalty, distance to goal) within the objective function, yields
a general framework that reliably represents action impact, and in particular,
capable of active disambiguation. Our approach is thus applicable to robust
active perception and autonomous navigation in perceptually aliased
environments. We demonstrate key aspects in basic and realistic simulations.

the Abbe limit poses a severe fundamental restriction on the resolution of

microlenses, such as microspheres or microfibers, can increase the resolution
by a factor of two beyond the Abbe limit. The theoretical mechanisms of these
methods are debated in the literature. In this work, we focus on the recently
expressed idea that optical coupling between closely spaced nanoscale objects
can lead to the formation of the modes that drastically impact the imaging
properties. These coupling effects emerge in nanoplasmonic or nanocavity
clusters, photonic molecules, or various arrays under resonant excitation
conditions. The coherent nature of imaging processes is key to understanding
their physical mechanisms. We used a cluster of point dipoles, as a simple
model system, to study and compare the consequences of coherent and incoherent
imaging. Using finite difference time domain modeling, we show that the
coherent images are full of artefacts. The out-of-phase oscillations produce
zero-intensity points that can be observed with practically unlimited
resolution (determined by the noise). We showed that depending on the phase
distribution, the nanoplasmonic cluster can appear with the arbitrary shape,
and such images were obtained experimentally.

These configurations, dubbed quasi-bound states, have been studied both in the
linear and nonlinear regimes. In this paper we show that quasi-bound states can
form in a dynamical scenario in which the mass of the black hole grows
significantly due to the capture of infalling matter. We solve the Klein-Gordon
equation numerically in spherical symmetry, mimicking the evolution of the
spacetime through a sequence of analytic Schwarzschild black hole solutions of
increasing mass. It is found that the frequency of oscillation of the
quasi-bound states decreases as the mass of the black hole increases. In
addition, accretion leads to a significative increase of the exponential decay
of the scalar field energy due to the presence of terms of order higher than
linear in the exponent. We compare the black hole mass growth rates used in our
study with estimates from observational surveys and extrapolate our results to
values of the scalar field masses consistent with models that propose scalar
fields as dark matter in the universe. We show that even for unrealistically
large mass accretion rates, quasi-bound states around accreting black holes can
survive for cosmological timescales. Our results provide further support to the
intriguing possibility of the existence of dark matter halos based on
(ultra-light) scalar fields surrounding supermassive black holes in galactic

investigated. The FM2 phase of PSCO is composed of [100] FM domains, with
magnetic symmetry Im'm'a (mz=0). The magnetic space group of the FM1 phase is
Fm'm'm (with mx=my). Neutron data analyses in combination with magnetometry and
earlier reports results agrees with a reorientation of the magnetization axis
by 45 deg within the a-b plane across the transition, in which the system
retains its metallic character. The presence below TS1 of conjugated magnetic
domains, both of Fm'm'm symmetry but having perpendicular spin orientations
along the diagonals in the xy-plane of the tetragonal unit cell, is at the
origin of the anomalies observed in the macroscopic magnetization. A relatively
small field m0H > 30 mT is able to reorient the magnetization within the a-b
plane, whereas a higher field (m0H,[H//z] >1.2 T at 2K) is necessary to align
the Co moments perpendicular to a-b plane. Such a spin reorientation, in which
the orbital and spin components of the Co moment rotate joined by 45deg, was
not observed with other lanthanides different to praseodymium.

  21/Feb/2017",,,,"cs.IT math.IT stat.AP","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  This paper presents a mutual coupling based calibration method for
time-division-duplex massive MIMO systems, which enables downlink precoding
based on uplink channel estimates. The entire calibration procedure is carried
out solely at the base station (BS) side by sounding all BS antenna pairs. An
Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm is derived, which processes the
measured channels in order to estimate calibration coefficients. The EM
algorithm outperforms current state-of-the-art narrow-band calibration schemes
in a mean squared error (MSE) and sum-rate capacity sense. Like its
predecessors, the EM algorithm is general in the sense that it is not only
suitable to calibrate a co-located massive MIMO BS, but also very suitable for
calibrating multiple BSs in distributed MIMO systems.
  The proposed method is validated with experimental evidence obtained from a
massive MIMO testbed. In addition, we address the estimated narrow-band
calibration coefficients as a stochastic process across frequency, and study
the subspace of this process based on measurement data. With the insights of
this study, we propose an estimator which exploits the structure of the process
in order to reduce the calibration error across frequency. A model for the
calibration error is also proposed based on the asymptotic properties of the
estimator, and is validated with measurement results.

  models for historical printings",,,,,"cs.DL","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Good OCR results for historical printings rely on the availability of
recognition models trained on diplomatic transcriptions as ground truth, which
is both a scarce resource and time-consuming to generate. Instead of having to
train a separate model for each historical typeface, we propose a strategy to
start from models trained on a combined set of available transcriptions in a
variety of fonts. These \emph{mixed models} result in character accuracy rates
over 90\% on a test set of printings from the same period of time, but without
any representation in the training data, demonstrating the possibility to
overcome the typography barrier by generalizing from a few typefaces to a
larger set of (similar) fonts in use over a period of time. The output of these
mixed models is then used as a baseline to be further improved by both fully
automatic methods and semi-automatic methods involving a minimal amount of
manual transcriptions. In order to evaluate the recognition quality of each
model in a series of models generated during the training process in the
absence of any ground truth, we introduce two readily observable quantities
that correlate well with true accuracy. These quantities are \emph{mean
character confidence C} (as given by the OCR engine OCRopus) and \emph{mean
token lexicality L} (a distance measure of OCR tokens from modern wordforms
taking historical spelling patterns into account, which can be calculated for
any OCR engine). Whereas the fully automatic method is able to improve upon the
result of a mixed model by only 1-2 percentage points, already 100-200
hand-corrected lines lead to much better OCR results with character error rates
of only a few percent. This procedure minimizes the amount of ground truth
production and does not depend on the previous construction of a specific
typographic model.

expected, increasing the volume through either chemical pressure or tensile
strain generally lowers the formation energy of neutral oxygen vacancies
consistent with their established tendency to expand the lattice. Increased
volume also favors polar distortions, both because competing rotations of the
oxygen octahedra are suppressed and because coulomb repulsion associated with
cation off-centering is reduced. Interestingly, the presence of ferroelectric
polarization favors ferromagnetic over antiferromagnetic ordering due to
suppressed antiferromagnetic superexchange as the polar distortion bends the
Mn-O-Mn bond angles away from the optimal 180deg. Intriguingly, we find that
polar distortions compete with the formation of oxygen vacancies, which have a
higher formation energy in the polar phases; conversely the presence of oxygen
vacancies suppresses the onset of polarization. In contrast, oxygen vacancy
formation energies are lower for ferromagnetic than antiferromagnetic orderings
of the same structure type. Our findings suggest a rich and complex phase
diagram, in which defect chemistry, polarization, structure and magnetism can
be modified using chemical potential, strain, and electric or magnetic fields.

also including degenerate parameter cases. Due to recent progress for the
continuous time case via the identification of an underlying stochastic

how to do it, and how to extend the approach to the discrete-time case as well.

that i) adding HARQ on top of AMC may be counterproductive in the high average

for slow fading channels, but it provides moderate throughput gains. We provide
explanations for these results which allow us to propose paths to improve

vacancies and stacking faults. In the case of vacancies the Fermi surface
becomes considerably altered, while the effect of stacking faults on the

recommendation mechanisms, provided by social media, for promoting their
products, services, brands and even ideas. However, many times, such social
network based campaigns perform poorly in practice because the intensity of the
recommendations drastically reduces beyond a few hops from the source. A
natural strategy for maintaining the intensity is to provide incentives. In
this paper, we address the problem of minimizing the cost incurred by the
campaigner for incentivizing a fraction of individuals in the social network,
while ensuring that the campaign message reaches a given expected fraction of
individuals. We also address the dual problem of maximizing the campaign
penetration for a resource constrained campaigner. To help us understand and
solve the above mentioned problems, we use percolation theory to formally state
them as optimization problems. These problems are not amenable to traditional
approaches because of a fixed point equation that needs to be solved
numerically. However, we use results from reliability theory to establish some
key properties of the fixed point, which in turn enables us to solve these
problems using algorithms that are linearithmic in maximum node degree.
Furthermore, we evaluate the efficacy of the analytical solution by performing
simulations on real world networks.

One possibility is that warm emission stems from an ""asteroid belt"" closer in

in an initially extended planetesimal disc. These planets carve a broad gap
around their orbits, splitting up the disc into the outer and the inner belts.
After the gas dispersal, both belts undergo collisional evolution in a

inclination distribution. Objects at $a\simeq$~2.764 au are quite dispersed in
this orbital element, giving the family a ""crab-like"" appearance. Recent works
showed that this feature is caused by the interaction of the family with the
$s-s_C$ nodal secular resonance with Ceres, that spreads the inclination of
asteroids near its separatrix. As a consequence, the currently observed
distribution of the $v_W$ component of terminal ejection velocities obtained
from inverting Gauss equation is quite leptokurtic, since this parameter mostly
depends on the asteroids inclination. The peculiar orbital configuration of the
Astrid family can be used to set constraints on key parameters describing the
strength of the Yarkovsky force, such as the bulk and surface density and the
thermal conductivity of surface material. By simulating various fictitious
families with different values of these parameters, and by demanding that the
current value of the kurtosis of the distribution in $v_W$ be reached over the
estimated lifetime of the family, we obtained that the thermal conductivity of
Astrid family members should be $\simeq$ 0.001 W/m/K, and that the surface and
bulk density should be higher than 1000 kg/m$^{3}$. Monte Carlo methods
simulating Yarkovsky and stochastic YORP evolution of the Astrid family show

led to much controversy in the confirmation of exoplanet candidates obtained
through analysing radial velocity data. To quantify the limitation of various
models and methods, we compare different noise models and signal detection
criteria for various simulated and real data sets in the Bayesian framework.
According to our analyses, the white noise model tend to interpret noise as
signal, leading to false positives. On the other hand, the red noise models are
likely to interprete signal as noise, resulting in false negatives. We find
that the Bayesian information criterion combined with a Bayes factor threshold
of 150 can efficiently rule out false positives and confirm true detections. We
further propose a Goldilocks principle aimed at modeling radial velocity noise
to avoid too many false positives and too many false negatives. We propose that
the noise model with RHK-dependent jitter is used in combination with the
moving average model to detect planetary signals for M dwarfs. Our work may
also shed light on the noise modeling for hotter stars, and provide a valid
approach for finding similar principles in other disciplines.

nanoantenna, which is tunable via photoexcitation of dense electron-hole plasma
with ultrafast relaxation rate. Basing on this concept, we demonstrate the
effect of beam steering up to 20 degrees via simple variation of incident
intensity, being suitable for ultrafast light routing in an optical chip. The
effect is demonstrated both in the visible and near-IR spectral regions for
silicon and germanium based nanoantennas. We also reveal the effect of
electron-hole plasma photoexcitation on local density of states (LDOS) in the
dimer gap and find that the orientation averaged LDOS can be altered by 50\%,
whereas modification of the projected LDOS can be even more dramatic: almost
500\% for transverse dipole orientation. Moreover, our analytical model sheds

It includes a didactic overview of the relevant theoretical considerations.
Practical aspects are highlighted with an extensive empirical study of the
common decoders in within-and across-subject predictions, on multiple datasets
--anatomical and functional MRI and MEG-- and simulations. Theory and
experiments outline that the popular "" leave-one-out "" strategy leads to
unstable and biased estimates, and a repeated random splits method should be
preferred. Experiments outline the large error bars of cross-validation in
neuroimaging settings: typical confidence intervals of 10%. Nested
cross-validation can tune decoders' parameters while avoiding circularity bias.
However we find that it can be more favorable to use sane defaults, in
particular for non-sparse decoders.

helioseismology. Using the Fourier-Legendre analysis is a technique for
addressing this problem. We validate this technique with the help of artificial
helioseismic data. The analysed data set was obtained by numerically simulating
the effect of the meridional flow on the seismic wave field in the full volume
of the Sun. In this way, a 51.2-hour long time series was generated. The
resulting surface velocity field is then analyzed in various settings: Two
$360^\circ \times 90^\circ$ halfspheres, two $120^\circ \times 60^\circ$
patches on the front and farside of the Sun (North and South, respectively) and
two $120^\circ \times 60^\circ$ patches on the northern and southern frontside
only. We compare two possible measurement setups: observations from Earth and
from an additional spacecraft on the solar farside, and observations from Earth
only, in which case the full information of the global solar oscillation wave
field was available. We find that, with decreasing observing area, the
accessible depth range decreases: the $360^\circ \times 90^\circ$ view allows
us to probe the meridional flow almost to the bottom of the convection zone,
while the $120^\circ \times 60^\circ$ view means only the outer layers can be
probed. These results confirm the validity of the Fourier-Legendre analysis
technique for helioseismology of the meridional flow. Furthermore these flows
are of special interest for missions like Solar Orbiter that promises to
complement standard helioseismic measurements from the solar nearside with
farside observations.

promoting products, ideas and information. A popular method of promoting a
product or even an idea is incentivizing individuals to evangelize the idea
vigorously by providing them with referral rewards in the form of discounts,
cash backs, or social recognition. Due to budget constraints on scarce
resources such as money and manpower, it may not be possible to provide
incentives for the entire population, and hence incentives need to be allocated
judiciously to appropriate individuals for ensuring the highest possible
outreach size. We aim to do the same by formulating and solving an optimization
problem using percolation theory. In particular, we compute the set of
individuals that are provided incentives for minimizing the expected cost while
ensuring a given outreach size. We also solve the problem of computing the set
of individuals to be incentivized for maximizing the outreach size for given
cost budget. The optimization problem turns out to be non trivial; it involves
quantities that need to be computed by numerically solving a fixed point
equation. Our primary contribution is, that for a fairly general cost
structure, we show that the optimization problems can be solved by solving a
simple linear program. We believe that our approach of using percolation theory
to formulate an optimization problem is the first of its kind.

sequence would arise due a recent core collapse of the host cluster, triggering
a number of stellar collisions and binary mass transfers simultaneously over a
brief episode of time. Here we examine this scenario using direct N-body
computations of moderately massive star clusters (of order 10^4 Msun ). As a
preliminary attempt, these models are initiated with approx. 8-10 Gyr old
stellar population and King profiles of high concentrations, being ""tuned"" to
undergo core collapse quickly. BSSs are indeed found to form in a ""burst"" at
the onset of the core collapse and several of such BS-bursts occur during the

two types of BSSs in the corresponding computed CMDs. We note that this may be
due to the less number of BSSs formed in these less massive models than that in

The method is based on the Generalised Scidar principle which consists in
taking double-star scintillation images on a defocused pupil plane and
calculating in real time the autocovariance of the scintillation. The main
components are an open-truss 40-cm Ritchey-Chr\'etien telescope, a german-type
equatorial mount, an Electron Multiplying CCD camera and a dedicated
acquisition and real-time data processing software. The new optical design of
LOLAS-2 is significantly simplified compared with the prototype. The
experiments carried out to test the permanence of the image within the useful
zone of the detector and the stability of the telescope focus show that LOLAS-2
can function without the use of the autoguiding and autofocus algorithms that
were developed for the prototype version. Optical turbulence profiles obtained
with the new Low Layer Scidar have the best altitude-resolution ever achieved
with Scidar-like techniques (6.3 m). The simplification of the optical layout

describing the properties of magnetic solids on the basis of electronic
Hamiltonian. We show that a spin Hamiltonian approach becomes consistent with
an electronic Hamiltonian approach if the spin lattice and its associated spin
exchange parameters, to be used for the spin Hamiltonian, are determined by the
energy-mapping analysis based on DFT calculations. The preferred spin
orientation (i.e., the magnetic anisotropy) of a magnetic ion is not predicted
by a spin Hamiltonian because it does not include the orbital degree of freedom
explicitly. In contrast, the magnetic anisotropy is readily predicted by
electronic structure theories employing both orbital and spin degrees of
freedom, if one takes into consideration the spin-orbit coupling (SOC). It was
shown that the preferred spin orientation of a magnetic ion can be predicted
and understood in terms of the HOMO-LUMO interactions of the magnetic ion by
taking SOC as perturbation. A spin Hamiltonian gives rise to the spin-half
misconception, namely, the blind belief that spin-half magnetic ions do not
possess magnetic anisotropy that arise from SOC. This misconception is a direct
consequence from the limitedness of a spin Hamiltonian that it lacks the
orbital degree of freedom. We show that the magnetic properties of 5d ion
oxides are better explained by the LS-coupling than by the jj-coupling scheme
of SOC, that the spin-orbital entanglement of 5d ions is not as strong as has
been assumed.

Accepted for publication in Phys. Rev. E",,"10.1103/PhysRevE.94.012902",,"cond-mat.stat-mech","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Hyperuniformity characterizes a state of matter that is poised at a critical
point at which density or volume-fraction fluctuations are anomalously
suppressed at infinite wavelengths. Recently, much attention has been given to
the link between strict jamming and hyperuniformity in frictionless
hard-particle packings. Doing so requires one to study very large packings,
which can be difficult to jam properly. We modify the rigorous linear
programming method of Donev et al. [J. Comp. Phys. 197, 139 (2004)] in order to
test for jamming in putatively jammed packings of hard-disks in two dimensions.
We find that various standard packing protocols struggle to reliably create
packings that are jammed for even modest system sizes; importantly, these
packings appear to be jammed by conventional tests. We present evidence that
suggests that deviations from hyperuniformity in putative maximally random
jammed (MRJ) packings can in part be explained by a shortcoming in generating
exactly-jammed configurations due to a type of ""critical slowing down"" as the
necessary rearrangements become difficult to realize by numerical protocols.
Additionally, various protocols are able to produce packings exhibiting
hyperuniformity to different extents, but this is because certain protocols are
better able to approach exactly-jammed configurations. Nonetheless, while one
should not generally expect exact hyperuniformity for disordered packings with
rattlers, we find that when jamming is ensured, our packings are very nearly
hyperuniform, and deviations from hyperuniformity correlate with an inability
to ensure jamming, suggesting that strict jamming and hyperuniformity are
indeed linked. This raises the possibility that the ideal MRJ packings have no
rattlers. Our work provides the impetus for the development of packing
algorithms that produce large disordered strictly jammed packings that are
rattler-free.

concerned with investigating the quantity and type of information processed by
various regions of the human brain; typically, estimates of classification
accuracy are used to quantify information. While a extensive and powerful
library of methods can be applied to train and assess classifiers, it is not
always clear how to use the resulting measures of classification performance to
draw scientific conclusions: e.g. for the purpose of evaluating redundancy
between brain regions. An additional confound for interpreting classification
performance is the dependence of the error rate on the number and choice of
distinct classes obtained for the classification task. In contrast, mutual
information is a quantity defined independently of the experimental design, and
has ideal properties for comparative analyses. Unfortunately, estimating the
mutual information based on observations becomes statistically infeasible in
high dimensions without some kind of assumption or prior.
  In this paper, we construct a novel classification-based estimator of mutual
information based on high-dimensional asymptotics. We show that in a particular
limiting regime, the mutual information is an invertible function of the
expected $k$-class Bayes error. While the theory is based on a large-sample,
high-dimensional limit, we demonstrate through simulations that our proposed
estimator has superior performance to the alternatives in problems of moderate

integral inequalities for the part related to the diffusion in the bilinear
form. Moreover, our result allows the construction of a simple postprocessing
that yields a more accurate solution. Finally, numerical experiments support
these theoretical results.

Several expressions for timing methods using digitized signals have been

the timing precision for algorithms using digital treatment of digitized signal
to mimic analog discriminator-based methods. The results of these calculations

estimator is similar to the Hutchison stochastic trace estimator, but instead
of the random noise vectors in Hutchison estimator, we use small number of
probing vectors determined by machine learning. Evaluation of the quality of
estimates and bias correction are discussed. An unbiased estimator is proposed
for the calculation of the expectation value of a function of traces. In the
numerical experiments with random matrices, it is shown that the precision of
trace estimates with $\mathcal{O}(10)$ probing vectors determined by the
machine learning is similar to that with $\mathcal{O}(10000)$ random noise
vectors.

competence in the evolution of decisions in a multi-agent system. The original
exchange mechanism, which is based on the human tendency to compromise and
change opinion through self-thinking, is here modified to include the role of
the agents' competence. In particular, we take into account the agents'
tendency to behave in the same way as if they were as good, or as bad, as their
partner: the so-called equality bias. This occurred in a situation where a wide
gap separated the competence of group members. We discuss the main properties
of the kinetic models and numerically investigate some examples of collective
decision under the influence of the equality bias. The results confirm that the
equality bias leads the group to suboptimal decisions.

magneto-hydrodynamic (MHD) flow driven by harmonic forcing. The linear
responses are analytically derived in a periodic box under the local WKB
approximation. Both the kinetic and Ohmic dissipations at the resonant
frequencies are calculated and the various parameters are investigated.
Although magnetic pressure may be negligible compared to thermal pressure,
magnetic field can be important for the first-order perturbation, e.g.
dynamical tides. It is found that magnetic field splits the resonant frequency,
namely the rotating hydrodynamic flow has only one resonant frequency but the
rotating MHD flow has two, one positive and the other negative. In the weak
field regime the dissipations are asymmetric around the two resonant
frequencies and this asymmetry is more striking with a weaker magnetic field.
It is also found that both the kinetic and Ohmic dissipations at the resonant
frequencies are inversely proportional to the Ekman number and the square of
wavenumber. The dissipation at the resonant frequency on small scales is almost
equal to the dissipation at the non-resonant frequencies, namely the resonance
takes its effect on the dissipation at intermediate length scales. Moreover,
the waves with phase propagation perpendicular to magnetic field are much more
damped. It is also interesting to find that the frequency-averaged dissipation
is constant. This result suggests that in compact objects magnetic effects on
tidal dissipation should be considered.

extend Wigner's little group by an additional generator, obtaining the maximal
solvable or Borel subgroup ${\rm Bor}_{1,3}$ which is equivalent to the
Kronecker sum of two copies of ${\rm sol}_2$, telling something about the

to be required for ground vehicles. In the past, their performance has been
assessed thoroughly in the labs and limited field testing, but not on a large

maximum and effective range, and then study the effect of environmental
factors, such as trees/foliage, weather, buildings, vehicle travel direction,

placement and installation, and can be used to develop DSRC communication
models for numerical simulations.
