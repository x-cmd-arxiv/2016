  Simulations",,,,,"cond-mat.soft","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In computational materials science, predicting the yield strain of
crosslinked polymers remains a challenging task. A common approach is to
identify yield via the first critical point of stress-strain curves produced by
molecular dynamics simulations. However, the simulated data can be excessively
noisy, making it difficult to extract meaningful results. In this work, we
discuss an alternate method for identifying yield on the basis of residual
strain computations. Notably, the associated raw data produce a sharper signal
for yield through a transition in their global behavior. As we show, this
transition can be analyzed in terms of simple functions (e.g. hyperbolas) that
admit straightforward uncertainty quantification techniques.

consisting of a Dirac field $\psi$ minimally coupled to Chern-Simons $U(1)$ and
$SO(2,1)$ connections, $A$ and $\omega$, respectively. This theory is connected
to a supersymmetric Chern-Simons form in which the gravitino has been projected
out (unconventional supersymmetry) and, in the case of a flat background,
corresponds to the low energy limit of graphene. The separation between
first-class and second-class constraints is performed explicitly, and both the
field equations and gauge symmetries of the Lagrangian formalism are fully
recovered. The degrees of freedom of the theory in generic sectors shows that
the propagating states correspond to fermionic modes in the background
determined by the geometry of the graphene sheet and the nondynamical
electromagnetic field. This is shown for the following canonical sectors: i) a
conformally invariant generic description where the spinor field and the
dreibein are locally rescaled; ii) a specific configuration for the Dirac
fermion consistent with its spin, where Weyl symmetry is exchanged by time
reparametrizations; iii) the vacuum sector $\psi=0$, which is of interest for
perturbation theory. For the latter the analysis is adapted to the case of
manifolds with boundary, and the corresponding Dirac brackets together with the
centrally extended charge algebra are found. Finally, the $SU(2)$
generalization of the gauge group is briefly treated, yielding analogous
conclusions for the degrees of freedom.

single stars and ~4.5% for the full sample ). This rate is much higher than
what has been discovered in the field, either with RV surveys or by transits.
High metallicity is not a cause for the excess of HJs in M67, nor can the
excess be attributed to high stellar masses. When combining this rate with the
non-zero eccentricity of the orbits, our results are qualitatively consistent
with a HJ formation scenario dominated by strong encounters with other stars or

Weaker emissions from atomic carbon were subsequently detected and also

line intensities reflecting the variation of CO2 to H2O column abundance along
the line-of-sight through the coma. Beginning in mid-April 2015, Alice
sporadically observed a number of outbursts above the sunward limb
characterized by sudden increases in the atomic emissions, particularly the
semi-forbidden O I 1356 multiplet, over a period of 10-30 minutes, without a
corresponding enhancement in long wavelength solar reflected light

1356/O I 1304 suggests O2 as the principal source of the additional gas. These

of the Alice spectrum changed considerably with CO Fourth Positive band
emission observed continuously, varying with pointing but otherwise fairly
constant in time. However, CO does not appear to be a major driver of any of

detections around the cut-off frequency of the filter. In addition, the white

Compo cannot, in most cases, adequately represent the power spectra of coronal

that several reports of periodic phenomena should be re-examined. The Torrence

the default confidence levels output from the code, and we propose new

are caused by the ever-present superposition of convection and oscillations

formation from 330 Lyman-break galaxies spanning the redshift range z=2-10 (to
~2-3 Msol/yr at 1sigma over the entire range). Given the depth and area of
ASPECS, we would expect to tentatively detect 35 galaxies extrapolating the
Meurer z~0 IRX-beta relation to z>~2 (assuming T_d~35 K). However, only 6
tentative detections are found at z>~2 in ASPECS, with just three at >3sigma.
Subdividing z=2-10 galaxies according to stellar mass, UV luminosity, and
UV-continuum slope and stacking the results, we only find a significant
detection in the most massive (>10^9.75 Msol) subsample, with an infrared
excess (IRX=L_{IR}/L_{UV}) consistent with previous z~2 results. However, the
infrared excess we measure from our large selection of sub-L* (<10^9.75 Msol)
galaxies is 0.11(-0.42)(+0.32) and 0.14(-0.14)(+0.15) at z=2-3 and z=4-10,
respectively, lying below even an SMC IRX-beta relation (95% confidence). These
results demonstrate the relevance of stellar mass for predicting the IR
luminosity of z>~2 galaxies. We furthermore find that the evolution of the
IRX-stellar mass relationship depends on the evolution of the dust temperature.
If the dust temperature increases monotonically with redshift (as (1+z)^0.32)
such that T_d~44-50 K at z>=4, current results are suggestive of little
evolution in this relationship to z~6. We use these results to revisit recent
estimates of the z>~3 SFR density. One less obvious implication is in
interpreting the high Halpha EWs seen in z~5 galaxies: our results imply that
star-forming galaxies produce Lyman-continuum photons at twice the efficiency
(per unit UV luminosity) as implied in conventional models. Star-forming
galaxies can then reionize the Universe, even if the escape fraction is <10%.

very edge of the nano-inclusion it is of extreme interest to assess the effect
of edge integrity upon axial stress transfer at the submicron scale. Here, we
conduct a detailed Raman line mapping near the edges of a monolayer graphene
flake which is simply supported onto an epoxy based photoresist
(SU8)/poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) matrix at steps as small as 100 nm. We
show for the first time that, the distribution of axial strain (stress) along
the flake deviates somewhat from the classical shear-lag prediction for a
region of about 2 um from the edge. This behavior is mainly attributed to the
presence of residual stresses, unintentional doping and/or edge effects
(deviation from the equilibrium values of bond lengths and angles, as well as
different edge chiralities). By considering a simple balance of shear-to-normal
stresses at the interface we are able to directly convert the strain (stress)
gradient to values of interfacial shear stress for all the applied tensile
levels without assuming classical shear-lag behavior. For large flakes a
maximum value of interfacial shear stress (ISS) of 0.4 MPa is obtained prior to
flake slipping.

We will then prove that the problem falls in the category of monotone
submodular maximization over a matroid constraint, and propose a time-efficient
greedy algorithm, which achieves an approximation ratio as 1/2. Simulation
results with real-life data-sets will validate the effectiveness of our

dialog system, the aim of dialog state tracking is to accurately estimate the
true dialog state from noisy observations produced by the speech recognition
and the natural language understanding modules. The state tracking task is
primarily meant to support a dialog policy. From a probabilistic perspective,
this is achieved by maintaining a posterior distribution over hidden dialog
states composed of a set of context dependent variables. Once a dialog policy
is learned, it strives to select an optimal dialog act given the estimated
dialog state and a defined reward function. This paper introduces a novel
method of dialog state tracking based on a bilinear algebric decomposition

the observed mass distributions with Monte Carlo simulations, but find that it
is difficult to constrain independently the initial mass function (IMF), the
initial-to-final-mass relation (IFMR), the stellar formation history (SFH), the
variation of the Galactic disk vertical scale height as a function of stellar
age, and binary evolution. Each of these input ingredients has a moderate
effect on the predicted mass distributions, and we must also take into account
biases owing to unidentified faint objects (20 pc sample), as well as unknown
masses for magnetic white dwarfs and spectroscopic calibration issues (SDSS
sample). Nevertheless, we find that fixed standard assumptions for the above
parameters result in predicted mean masses that are in good qualitative
agreement with the observed values. It suggests that derived masses for both

tool claims to provide better programming, data and execution models, for which
only informal (and often confusing) semantics is generally provided, all share
a common underlying model, namely, the Dataflow model. The Dataflow model we
propose shows how various tools share the same expressiveness at different
levels of abstraction. The contribution of this work is twofold: first, we show
that the proposed model is (at least) as general as existing batch and
streaming frameworks (e.g., Spark, Flink, Storm), thus making it easier to
understand high-level data-processing applications written in such frameworks.
Second, we provide a layered model that can represent tools and applications
following the Dataflow paradigm and we show how the analyzed tools fit in each
level.

tasks, the artificial neural networks (ANNs) have been studied in the hope of
achieving human-like performance in many applications. Since the ANNs have the
ability to approximate complex functions from observations, it is
straightforward to consider the ANNs for steganography. In this paper, we aim
to implement the well-known LSB substitution and matrix coding steganography
with the feed-forward neural networks (FNNs). Our experimental results have
shown that, the used FNNs can achieve the data embedding operation of the LSB
substitution and matrix coding steganography. For steganography with the ANNs,
though there may be some challenges to us, it would be very promising and
valuable to pay attention to the ANNs for steganography, which may be a new

Contur, exploits the fact that particle-level differential measurements made in
fiducial regions of phase-space have a high degree of model-independence. These
measurements can therefore be compared to BSM physics implemented in Monte
Carlo generators in a very generic way, allowing a wider array of final states
to be considered than is typically the case. The Contur approach should be seen
as complementary to the discovery potential of direct searches, being designed
to eliminate inconsistent BSM proposals in a context where many (but perhaps
not all) measurements are consistent with the Standard Model. We demonstrate,

sparse, block sparse, node-perturbed sparse, etc., such that it can be
characterized by a suitable (atomic) norm. We present and analyze a
norm-regularized estimator for directly estimating the change in structure,
without having to estimate the structures of the individual Ising models. The
estimator can work with any norm, and can be generalized to other graphical
models under mild assumptions. We show that only one set of samples, say $n_2$,
needs to satisfy the sample complexity requirement for the estimator to work,
and the estimation error decreases as $\frac{c}{\sqrt{\min(n_1,n_2)}}$, where
$c$ depends on the Gaussian width of the unit norm ball. For example, for
$\ell_1$ norm applied to $s$-sparse change, the change can be accurately

probes of the inner accretion disk. The X-ray reflection features can be
weakened due to strong magnetic fields or very low iron abundances such as is
possible in X-ray binaries with low mass, first generation stars as companions.
Here we investigate the reality of the broad iron line detected earlier from
the neutron star low mass X-ray binary 4U~1820--30 with a degenerate helium
dwarf companion. We perform a comprehensive, systematic broadband spectral
study of the atoll source using \suzaku{} and simultaneous \nustar{} \&
\swift{} observations. We have used different continuum models involving
accretion disk emission, thermal blackbody and thermal Comptonization of either
disk or blackbody photons. The \suzaku{} data show positive and negative
residuals in the region of iron K band. These features are well described by
two absorption edges at $7.67\pm0.14\kev$ and $6.93\pm0.07\kev$ or partial
covering photoionized absorption or by blurred reflection. Though, the
simultaneous \swift{} and \nustar{} data do not clearly reveal the emission or
absorption features, the data are consistent with the presence of either
absorption or emission features. Thus, the absorption based models provide an
alternative to the broad iron line or reflection model. The absorption features
may arise in winds from the inner accretion disk. The broadband spectra appear
to disfavour continuum models in which the blackbody emission from the neutron
star surface provides the seed photons for thermal Comptonization. Our results
suggest emission from a thin accretion disk ($kT_{disk} \sim 1\kev$),
Comptonization of disk photons in a boundary layer most likely covering a large
fraction of the neutron star surface and innermost parts of the accretion disk,
and blackbody emission ($kT_{bb} \sim 2\kev$) from the polar regions.

galaxies remains a key obstacle in evaluating whether galaxies were the primary
agents of cosmic reionization. We previously proposed using the covering
fraction of low-ionization gas, measured via deep absorption line spectroscopy,
as a proxy. We now present a significant update, sampling seven
gravitationally-lensed sources at $4<z<5$. We show that the absorbing gas in
our sources is spatially inhomogeneous with a median covering fraction of 66\%.
Correcting for reddening according to a dust-in-cloud model, this implies an
estimated absolute escape fraction of $\simeq19\pm6$\%. With possible biases
and uncertainties, collectively we find the average escape fraction could be
reduced to no less than 11\%, excluding the effect of spatial variations. For
one of our lensed sources, we have sufficient signal/noise to demonstrate the
presence of such spatial variations and scatter in its dependence on the
Ly$\alpha$ equivalent width, consistent with recent simulations. If this source
is typical, our lower limit to the escape fraction could be reduced by a
further factor $\simeq$2. Across our sample, we find a modest anti-correlation
between the inferred escape fraction and the local star formation rate,
consistent with a time delay between a burst and leaking Lyman continuum
photons. Our analysis demonstrates considerable variations in the escape
fraction consistent with being governed by the small-scale behavior of
star-forming regions, whose activities fluctuate over short timescales. This
supports the suggestion that the escape fraction may increase toward the
reionization era when star formation becomes more energetic and burst-like.

(SMAs) are compared and potential improvement for eC performances of SMAs is
proposed. Both the plateau and hysteresis of stress-strain curve in NR and SMAs
are observed. They are attributed to the similar phase transformation:
strain-induced crystallization (SIC) in NR and martensitic transformation in
SMAs. For NR, the drawback of large strain can be reduced by pre-strain. For
SMAs, the stress change with strain is smaller in stress plateau regime. Thus,
the drawback of large dynamic stress of SMAs is proposed to be reduced by a
static pre-stress for working directly in this stress plateau regime. Choosing
an appropriate pre-strain (pre-stress) and strain amplitude can make eC effect
of NR working in the phase transformation (SIC) regime. This method can improve
both the eC strength and fatigue life in NR. Due to the similar phase
transformation (martensitic transformation) of SMAs to NR, this method is also
proposed to improve the eC performances of SMAs.

For the 2C$_2$H$_2$+5O$_2$+21Ar system, reasonable agreement was found between
the experiments and steady wave prediction, particularly for the critical
divergence leading to failure. Observations of the reaction zone structure in
these detonations indicated that all the gas reacted very close to the front,
as the transverse waves were reactive. The experiments obtained in the much
more unstable detonations in C$_3$H$_8$+5O$_2$ showed significant differences
between the experimentally derived $D(K)$ curve and the prediction of steady

detonability of cellular detonations. The transverse waves in this mixture were
found to be non-reactive, hence permitting to shed off non-reacted pockets,

differences between experiment and the inviscid model in this class of cellular

user follows \emph{closest BS association policy} at both spatial locations and
moves from $\ell_1$ to $\ell_2$. With this user displacement, two scenarios can
occur: i) the user is handed off to a new serving BS at $\ell_2$, or ii) no
handoff occurs and the user is served by the same BS at both locations. After
providing intermediate results such as probability of handoff and distance
distributions of the serving BS at the two user locations, we use them to
derive exact expressions for spatio-temporal interference correlation
coefficient and joint coverage probability for any distance separation $v$. We
also study two different handoff strategies: i) \emph{handoff skipping}, and
ii) \emph{conventional handoffs}, and derive the expressions of joint coverage
probability for both strategies. The exact analysis is not straightforward and
involves a careful treatment of the neighborhood of the two spatial locations

provide easy-to-use expressions for two special cases: i) static user ($v =0$)

shows that the interference correlation and joint coverage probability decrease

Physical relevance of the GPCs is confirmed by analytical means for the ground
state in the regime of weak couplings by finding its vector of natural
occupation numbers close to the boundary of the allowed region. Such
quasipinning is found to become weaker in the intermediate and strong coupling
regime. The study of crossovers between different spatial dimensions by
detuning the harmonic trap frequencies suggests that quasipinning is
essentially an effect for systems with reduced spatial dimensionality. In
addition, we find that quasipinning becomes stronger by increasing the degree
of spin-polarization. Consequently, the number of states available around the
Fermi level plays a key role for the occurrence of quasipinning. This suggests
that quasipinning emerges from the conflict between energy minimization and

also discuss the `weight bias' that may arise in optimally-weighted

biases arising from both galaxy selection and shear measurement, and to derive
an empirical correction to reduce the shear biases to $\lesssim 1\%$, we create
a suite of simulated images whose properties are close to those of the KiDS
survey observations. We find that the use of `self-calibration' reduces the
additive and multiplicative shear biases significantly, although further
correction via a calibration scheme is required, which also corrects for a
dependence of the bias on galaxy properties. We find that the calibration
relation itself is biased by the use of noisy, measured galaxy properties,
which may limit the final accuracy that can be achieved. We assess the accuracy
of the calibration in the tomographic bins used for the KiDS cosmic shear
analysis, testing in particular the effect of possible variations in the
uncertain distributions of galaxy size, magnitude and ellipticity, and conclude
that the calibration procedure is accurate at the level of multiplicative bias

gravitational lensing analysis of ~450deg$^2$ of imaging data from the Kilo
Degree Survey (KiDS). For a flat $\Lambda$CDM cosmology with a prior on $H_0$
that encompasses the most recent direct measurements, we find
$S_8\equiv\sigma_8\sqrt{\Omega_{\rm m}/0.3}=0.745\pm0.039$. This result is in
good agreement with other low redshift probes of large scale structure,
including recent cosmic shear results, along with pre-Planck cosmic microwave
background constraints. A $2.3$-$\sigma$ tension in $S_8$ and `substantial
discordance' in the full parameter space is found with respect to the Planck
2015 results. We use shear measurements for nearly 15 million galaxies,
determined with a new improved `self-calibrating' version of $lens$fit
validated using an extensive suite of image simulations. Four-band $ugri$
photometric redshifts are calibrated directly with deep spectroscopic surveys.
The redshift calibration is confirmed using two independent techniques based on
angular cross-correlations and the properties of the photometric redshift
probability distributions. Our covariance matrix is determined using an
analytical approach, verified numerically with large mock galaxy catalogues. We
account for uncertainties in the modelling of intrinsic galaxy alignments and
the impact of baryon feedback on the shape of the non-linear matter power
spectrum, in addition to the small residual uncertainties in the shear and
redshift calibration. The cosmology analysis was performed blind. Our
high-level data products, including shear correlation functions, covariance
matrices, redshift distributions, and Monte Carlo Markov Chains are available

modifications of the Poisson equation relating the matter density contrast to
the lensing and the Newtonian potentials, respectively. They will be well
constrained by future surveys of large scale structure. But what would the
implications of measuring particular values of these functions be for modified
gravity theories? We ask this question in the context of general Horndeski
class of single field scalar-tensor theories with second order equations of
motion. We find several consistency conditions that make it possible to rule
out broad classes of theories based on measurements of $\Sigma$ and $\mu$ that
are independent of their parametric forms. For instance, a measurement of
$\Sigma \ne 1$ would rule out all models with a canonical form of kinetic
energy, while finding $\Sigma-1$ and $\mu-1$ to be of opposite sign would
strongly disfavour the entire class of Horndeski models. We separately examine
the large and the small scale limits, the possibility of scale-dependence, and
the consistency with bounds on the speed of gravitational waves. We identify
sub-classes of Horndeski theories that can be ruled out based on the measured
difference between $\Sigma$ and $\mu$.

the magnetic suppression of turbulence (generated through various instabilities
during the formation of molecular clouds by converging) on the subsequent star
formation (SF) activity. We study four magnetically supercritical models with
magnetic field strengths $B= 0$, 1, 2, and 3 $\mu$G (corresponding to
mass--to--flux ratios of $\infty$, 4.76, 2.38, and 1.59 times the critical

find that, for increasing magnetic field strength, the clouds formed tend to be
more massive, denser, less turbulent, and with higher SF activity. This causes
the onset of star formation activity in the non--magnetic or more weakly
magnetized cases to be delayed by a few Myr in comparison to the more strongly
magnetized cases. We attribute this behavior to the suppression of the
nonlinear thin shell instability (NTSI) by the magnetic field, previously found
by Heitsch and coworkers. This result is contrary to the standard notion that
the magnetic field provides support to the clouds, thus reducing their star
formation rate (SFR). However, our result is a completely nonlinear one, and
could not be foreseen from simple linear considerations.

lore, we find that such an explanation is possible if net $B-L$ number is
stored in a light bosonic field with hyper-Planckian initial displacement and a
delicately chosen field velocity prior to inflation. However, such a
construction may require extremely tuned coupling constants to ensure that this
asymmetry is viably communicated to the Standard Model after reheating; the
large field displacement required to overcome inflationary dilution must not
induce masses for Standard Model particles or generate dangerous washout
processes. While these features are inelegant, this counterexample nonetheless
shows that there is no theorem against such an explanation. We also comment on
potential observables in the double $\beta$-decay spectrum and on model
variations that may allow for more natural realizations.

interstellar medium using three-dimensional hydrodynamical simulations carried
out with FLASH. The selected galactic disc region has a size of (500 pc)$^2$ x
$\pm$ 5 kpc and a gas surface density of 10 M$_{\odot}$/pc$^2$. The simulations
include an external stellar potential and gas self-gravity, radiative cooling
and diffuse heating, sink particles representing star clusters, stellar winds
from these clusters which combine the winds from indi- vidual massive stars by
following their evolution tracks, and subsequent supernova explosions. Dust and
gas (self-)shielding is followed to compute the chemical state of the gas with
a chemical network. We find that stellar winds can regulate star (cluster)
formation. Since the winds suppress the accretion of fresh gas soon after the
cluster has formed, they lead to clusters which have lower average masses
(10$^2$ - 10$^{4.3}$ M$_{\odot}$) and form on shorter timescales (10$^{-3}$ -
10 Myr). In particular we find an anti-correlation of cluster mass and
accretion time scale. Without winds the star clusters easily grow to larger
masses for ~5 Myr until the first supernova explodes. Overall the most massive
stars provide the most wind energy input, while objects beginning their
evolution as B-type stars contribute most of the supernova energy input. A
significant outflow from the disk (mass loading $\gtrsim$ 1 at 1 kpc) can be
launched by thermal gas pressure if more than 50% of the volume near the disc
mid-plane can be heated to T > 3x10$^5$ K. Stellar winds alone cannot create a
hot volume-filling phase. The models which are in best agreement with observed
star formation rates drive either no outflows or weak outflows.

combining the samples from the various surveys and correcting for their
respective selection effects, we find the properties of companions to O-type
and B-type main-sequence (MS) stars differ among three regimes. First, at short
orbital periods P < 20 days (separations a < 0.4 AU), the binaries have small
eccentricities e < 0.4, favor modest mass ratios <q> = 0.5, and exhibit a small
excess of twins q > 0.95. Second, the companion frequency peaks at intermediate
periods log P (days) = 3.5 (a = 10 AU), where the binaries have mass ratios
weighted toward small values q = 0.2-0.3 and follow a Maxwellian ""thermal""
eccentricity distribution. Finally, companions with long orbital periods log P
(days) = 5.5-7.5 (a = 200-5,000 AU) are outer tertiary components in
hierarchical triples, and have a mass ratio distribution across q = 0.1-1.0
that is nearly consistent with random pairings drawn from the initial mass
function. We discuss these companion distributions and properties in the
context of binary star formation and evolution. We also reanalyze the binary
statistics of solar-type MS primaries, taking into account that (30+/-10)% of
single-lined spectroscopic binaries likely contain white dwarf companions
instead of low-mass stellar secondaries. The mean frequency of stellar
companions with q > 0.1 and log P (days) < 8.0 per primary increases from
0.50+/-0.04 for solar-type MS primaries to 2.1+/-0.3 for O-type MS primaries.
We fit joint probability density functions f(M_1,q,P,e) to the corrected

Using a set of input parameters, we construct a number of models in 3D and
calculate the spatially integrated velocity and velocity dispersion for each
model. We find that three primary parameters, i.e., intrinsic velocity, bicone
inclination, and the amount of dust extinction, mainly determine the simulated
velocity and velocity dispersion. Velocity dispersion increases as the
intrinsic velocity or the bicone inclination increases, while velocity (i.e.,
velocity shifts with respect to systemic velocity) increases as the amount of
dust extinction increases. Simulated emission-line profiles well reproduce the
observed [O III] line profiles, e.g., a narrow core and a broad wing
components. By comparing model grids and Monte Carlo simulations with the
observed [O III] velocity-velocity dispersion (VVD) distribution of ~39,000
type 2 AGNs, we constrain the intrinsic velocity of gas outflows ranging from
~500 km/s to ~1000 km/s for the majority of AGNs, and up to ~1500-2000 km/s for
extreme cases. The Monte Carlo simulations show that the number ratio of AGNs
with negative [O III] velocity to AGNs with positive [O III] velocity
correlates with the outflow opening angle, suggesting that outflows with higher
intrinsic velocity tend to have wider opening angles. These results demonstrate
the potential of our 3D models for studying the physical properties of gas

study Andromeda's cluster and field populations over the last $\sim$300 Myr. We
measure $\Gamma$ of 4-8% for young, 10-100 Myr old populations in M31. We find
that cluster formation efficiency varies systematically across the M31 disk,
consistent with variations in mid-plane pressure. These $\Gamma$ measurements
expand the range of well-studied galactic environments, providing precise
constraints in an HI-dominated, low intensity star formation environment.
Spatially resolved results from M31 are broadly consistent with previous trends
observed on galaxy-integrated scales, where $\Gamma$ increases with increasing
star formation rate surface density ($\Sigma_{\mathrm{SFR}}$). However, we can
explain observed scatter in the relation and attain better agreement between
observations and theoretical models if we account for environmental variations
in gas depletion time ($\tau_{\mathrm{dep}}$) when modeling $\Gamma$,
accounting for the qualitative shift in star formation behavior when
transitioning from a H$_2$-dominated to a HI-dominated interstellar medium. We
also demonstrate that $\Gamma$ measurements in high $\Sigma_{\mathrm{SFR}}$

stellar masses of the sample (M_* ~ 1.5-4 x 10^11 Msun) in the first 2 Gyrs of
cosmic history, with a diverse range in stellar ages, star formation rates and

far-infrared (FIR) fluxes we confirm that >80% of the sample are hosts to
luminous hidden active galactic nuclei (AGNs), with bolometric luminosities of
~10^(44-46) erg/s. We find that the MIPS 24um photometry is largely
contaminated by AGN continuum, rendering the SFRs derived using only 24um

evidence for a rapid increase of the AGN fraction from ~30% to ~60-100% over

calibrate our physical model using a novel approach to create realistic
galaxies at z=0, so the simulation is predictive at high redshifts. With this

function at faint magnitudes down to $M_\mathrm{UV}$~-15, two magnitudes
fainter than observations, and (2) estimate $f_\mathrm{esc}$ over a large range
of galaxy masses based on the detailed stellar and gas distributions in

within the ASTRODEEP collaboration to generate mock galaxy catalogs for deep
fields with realistic fluxes and simple morphologies. The simulation procedure
is based exclusively on empirical prescriptions -- rather than first principles
-- to provide the most accurate match with observations at 0<z<7. In
particular, we consider that galaxies can be either quiescent or star-forming,
and use their stellar mass (M*) and redshift (z) as the fundamental properties
from which all the other observables can be statistically derived. Drawing z
and M* from the observed galaxy stellar mass functions, we associate a star
formation rate (SFR) to each galaxy from the tight SFR-M* main sequence, while
dust attenuation, optical colors and morphologies (including bulge-to-total
ratios, sizes and aspect ratios) are obtained from empirical relations that we
establish from the high quality Hubble and Herschel observations available in
the CANDELS fields. Random scatter is introduced in each step to reproduce the
observed distributions of each parameter. Based on these observables, a
panchromatic spectral energy distribution (SED) is selected for each galaxy and
synthetic photometry is produced by integrating the redshifted SED in common
broad-band filters. Finally, the mock galaxies are placed on the sky at random
positions with a fixed angular two-point correlation function to implement
basic clustering. The resulting flux catalogs reproduce accurately the observed
number counts in all broad bands from the ultraviolet up to the sub-millimeter,
and can be directly fed to image simulators such as Skymaker. The images can
then be used to test source extraction softwares and image-based techniques
such as stacking. EGG is open-source, and is made available to the community
together with a set of pre-generated catalogs and images.

first and second-order derivatives of intensities to represent motion and
appearance respectively. These features are then used to construct covariance
matrices which capture joint statistics of both low-level motion and appearance
features extracted from a video. Using an over-complete dictionary of the
covariance based descriptors built from labeled training samples, we formulate
low-level event recognition as a sparse linear approximation problem. Within
this, we pose the sparse decomposition of a covariance matrix, which also
conforms to the space of semi-positive definite matrices, as a determinant
maximization problem. Also since covariance matrices lie on non-linear
Riemannian manifolds, we compare our former approach with a sparse linear
approximation alternative that is suitable for equivalent vector spaces of
covariance matrices. This is done by searching for the best projection of the
query data on a dictionary using an Orthogonal Matching pursuit algorithm. We
show the applicability of our video descriptor in two different application
domains - namely low-level event recognition in unconstrained scenarios and
gesture recognition using one shot learning. Our experiments provide promising
insights in large scale video analysis.

this profit results from the exploitation of the differences in market clearing
prices at different times. Alternatively it may be the minimisation of the cost
of generation, or the maximisation of consumer surplus or social welfare. In
all cases there is calculated for each successive time-step the cost function
measuring the total impact of whatever action is taken by the storage. The
succession of such cost functions provides the information for the storage to
determine how to behave over time, forming the basis of the appropriate
optimisation problem. Further, optimal decision making, even over a very long

relatively short running time horizon -- for storage of electrical energy
typically of the order of a day or so.
  We study particularly competition between multiple stores, where the
objective of each store is to maximise its own income given the activities of
the remainder. We show that, at the Cournot Nash equilibrium, multiple large

expense of the remainder. We quantify this for linear price functions

post-Babcock observed features of the magnetic activity cycle and convection

tubes in the convection zone. A sequence of four schematic cartoons lays out
the proposed evolution of the global configuration of the magnetic field above,
in, and at the bottom of the convection zone through sunspot Cycle 23 and into
Cycle 24. Three key elements of the amended scenario are: (1) as the net
following-polarity field from the sunspot-region omega-loop fields of an
ongoing sunspot cycle is swept poleward to cancel and replace the
opposite-polarity polar-cap field from the previous sunspot cycle, it remains
connected to the ongoing sunspot cycle's toroidal source-field band at the
bottom of the convection zone; (2) topological pumping by the convection zone's
free convection keeps the horizontal extent of the poleward-migrating
following-polarity field pushed to the bottom, forcing it to gradually cancel
and replace old horizontal field below it that connects the ongoing-cycle
source-field band to the previous-cycle polar-cap field; (3) in each polar
hemisphere, by continually shearing the poloidal component of the settling new
horizontal field, the latitudinal differential rotation low in the convection
zone generates the next-cycle source-field band poleward of the ongoing-cycle
band. The amended scenario is a more-plausible version of Babcock's scenario,

ability of reverse sequences to adopt native-like folds is strongly in
influenced by protein size and the flexibility of the native hydrophobic core.
For \b{eta}-hairpins with reverse-sequences that fail to fold, we employ a
simple mutational strategy for guiding stable hairpin formation that involves
the insertion of amino acids into the \b{eta}-turn region. This systematic look
at reverse sequence duality sheds new light on the problem of protein
sequence-structure mapping and may serve to inspire new protein design and
protein structure prediction protocols.

of data from many astronomical observatories. Its main focus is on the Herschel
data, which maps dust obscured star formation over 1300 deg$^2$. With this
unprecedented combination of data sets, it is possible to investigate how the
star formation vs stellar mass relation (main-sequence) of star-forming
galaxies depends on environment. In this pilot study we explore this question
between 0.1 < z < 3.2 using data in the COSMOS field. We estimate the local
environment from a smoothed galaxy density field using the full photometric
redshift probability distribution. We estimate star formation rates by stacking
the SPIRE data from the Herschel Multi-tiered Extragalactic Survey (HerMES).
Our analysis rules out the hypothesis that the main-sequence for star-forming
systems is independent of environment at 1.5 < z < 2, while a simple model in
which the mean specific star formation rate declines with increasing
environmental density gives a better description. However, we cannot exclude a
simple hypothesis in which the main-sequence for star-forming systems is
independent of environment at z < 1.5 and z > 2. We also estimate the evolution
of the star formation rate density in the COSMOS field and our results are
consistent with previous measurements at z < 1.5 and z > 2 but we find a
$1.4^{+0.3}_{-0.2}$ times higher peak value of the star formation rate density
at $z \sim 1.9$.

State-of-the-art methods use probabilistic distribution or subspace to model a

Learning-based hashing is often used in large scale image retrieval as they
provide a compact representation of each sample and the Hamming distance can be
used to efficiently compare two samples. However, most hashing methods encode
each image separately and discard knowledge that multiple images in the same

by combining both set representation and hashing in a single deep neural
network. An image set is first passed to a CNN module to extract image
features, then these features are aggregated using two types of set feature to
capture both set specific and database-wide distribution information. The
computed set feature is then fed into a multilayer perceptron to learn a
compact binary embedding. Triplet loss is used to train the network by forming
set similarity relations using class labels. We extensively evaluate our
approach on datasets used for image matching and show highly competitive

machine learning, and work in the area of interpretable models has found
renewed interest. In some applications, such models are as accurate as
non-interpretable ones, and thus are preferred for their transparency. Even
when they are not accurate, they may still be preferred when interpretability
is of paramount importance. However, restricting machine learning to
interpretable models is often a severe limitation. In this paper we argue for
explaining machine learning predictions using model-agnostic approaches. By
treating the machine learning models as black-box functions, these approaches
provide crucial flexibility in the choice of models, explanations, and

intermediate-age star clusters in the Large and Small Magellanic Clouds is
often interpreted as resulting from extended star-formation histories (SFHs),
lasting $\geq$ 300 Myr. This strongly conflicts with the traditional view of
the dominant star-formation mode in stellar clusters, which are thought of as
single-aged stellar populations. Here we present a test of this interpretation
by exploring the morphology of the subgiant branch (SGB) of NGC 411, which
hosts possibly the most extended eMSTO among all known intermediate-age star
clusters. We show that the width of the NGC 411 SGB favours the single-aged
stellar population interpretation and rules out an extended SFH. In addition,
when considering the red clump (RC) morphology and adopting the unproven
premise that the widths of all features in the colour--magnitude diagram are
determined by an underlying range in ages, we find that the SFH implied is
still very close to that resulting from a single-aged stellar population, with
a minor fraction of stars scattering to younger ages compared with the bulk of
the population. The SFHs derived from the SGB and RC are both inconsistent with
the SFH derived from the eMSTO region. NGC 411 has a very low escape velocity
and it has unlikely undergone significant mass loss at an early stage, thus
indicating that it may lack the capacity to capture most of its initial,
expelled gas from stellar evolutionary processes, a condition often required
for extended SFHs to take root.

realized with multiple conventional lithography or electron beam lithographic
techniques, is proposed to achieve broadband bianisotropic optical response
analogous to helical metamaterial. On the basis of twisted metamaterial, via
tailoring the relative orientation within the lattice, the anisotropy of arc is
converted into magneto-electric coupling of closely spaced arc pairs, which
leads to a broad bianisotropic optical response. By connecting the adjacent
upper and lower arcs, the coupling of metasurface pairs is transformed to the
coupling of the three-dimensional inclusions, and provides a much broader and
higher bianisotropic optical response. For only a four-layer helix-like
metamaterial, the maximum extinction ratio can reach 19.7. The operation band
is in the wavelength range from 4.69 {\mu}m to 8.98 {\mu}m with an average
extinction ratio of 6.9. And the transmittance for selective polarization is
above 0.8 in the entire operation band. Such a structure is promising for
integratable and scalable broadband circular polarizers, especially has great
potential to act as broadband circular micropolarizers in the field of the
full-stokes division of focal plane polarimeters.

of several intrinsic features of this area, such as the generality of the

incorporation of concepts and methods deriving from many areas, from
statistical physics to sociology, which are often used in an independent way.
Yet, for this same reason, it would be desirable to integrate these various

several benefits normally allowed by the systematization in science, including
the identification of new types of problems and the cross-fertilization between
fields. More specifically, the identification of the main areas to which the
concepts frequently used in complex networks can be applied paves the way to
adopting and applying a larger set of concepts and methods deriving from those

networks research, pattern recognition, optimization, linear algebra, and time

diverse areas regarding complex networks research. In order to do so, we start
by grouping the multidisciplinary concepts into three main groups, namely
features, similarity, and network connectivity. Then we show that several of
the analysis and modeling approaches to complex networks can be thought as a
composition of maps between these three groups, with emphasis on nine main
types of mappings, which are presented and illustrated. Such a systematization
of principles and approaches also provides an opportunity to review some of the

observe three discrete resistance levels (low, intermediate and high), which
can be set either by the application of current-voltage ramps or by means of
single pulses. These states exhibit retention and endurance capabilities
exceeding $10^4$ s and 70 cycles, respectively. We rationalize our experimental

electrode area dependence and temperature dependent resistance measurements
support our scenario. After device failure takes place, the system can be
turned functional again by heating up to low temperature (120 C), a feature

discovered a steady and extended very high-energy (VHE) gamma-ray source
towards the luminous blue variable candidate LBV1806-20, massive stellar
cluster Cl*1806-20, and magnetar SGR1806-20. The new VHE source, HESSJ1808-204,
was detected at a statistical significance of >6sigma (post-trial) with a
photon flux normalisation $(2.9 \pm 0.4_{\rm stat} \pm 0.5_{\rm sys})\times
10^{-13}$\,ph\,cm$^{-2}$\,s$^{-1}$\,TeV$^{-1}$ at 1TeV and a power-law photon
index of $2.3\pm0.2_{\rm stat}\pm 0.3_{\rm sys}$. The luminosity of this source
(0.2 to 10 TeV; scaled to distance d=8.7kpc) is $L_{\rm VHE}\sim1.6 \times
10^{34}(d/{8.7kpc})^2$\,erg\,s$^{-1}$. The VHE gamma-ray emission is extended
and is well fit by a single Gaussian with statistical standard deviation of
$0.095^\circ \pm 0.015^\circ$. This extension is similar to that of the
synchrotron radio nebula G10.0-0.3, which is thought to be powered by
LBV1806-20. The VHE gamma-ray luminosity could be provided by the stellar wind
luminosity of LBV1806-20 by itself and/or the massive star members of
Cl*1806-20. Alternatively, magnetic dissipation (e.g. via reconnection) from
SGR1806-20 can potentially account for the VHE luminosity. The origin and
hadronic and/or leptonic nature of the accelerated particles responsible for
HESSJ1808-204 is not yet clear. If associated with SGR1806-20, the potentially
young age of the magnetar (650yr) can be used to infer the transport limits of
these particles to match the VHE source size. This discovery provides new
interest in the potential for high-energy particle acceleration from magnetars,
massive stars, and/or stellar clusters.

the role of local synergy, i.e., the interaction of elements that when combined
produce a total effect greater than the sum of the individualelements, has been
studied but only for irreversible spreading dynamics. Reversible spreading
dynamics are ubiquitous but their interplay with synergy has remained unknown.
To fill this knowledge gap, we articulate a model to incorporate local
synergistic effect into the classical susceptible-infected-susceptible process,
in which the probability for a susceptible node to become infected through an
infected neighbor is enhanced when the neighborhood of the latter contains a
number of infected nodes. We derive master equations incorporating the
synergistic effect, with predictions that agree well with the numerical
results. A striking finding is that, when a parameter characterizing the
strength of the synergy reinforcement effect is above a critical value, the
steady state density of the infected nodes versus the basic transmission rate
exhibits an explosively increasing behavior and a hysteresis loop emerges. In
fact, increasing the synergy strength can promote the spreading and reduce the
invasion and persistence thresholds of the hysteresis loop. A physical
understanding of the synergy promoting explosive spreading and the associated
hysteresis behavior can be obtained through a mean-field analysis.

distributions of the response variable by capturing the effect of the
covariates at different quantile levels. In most applications, the parametric
form of those conditional distributions is unknown and varies across the
covariate space, so fitting the given quantile levels simultaneously without
relying on parametric assumptions is crucial. In this work we propose a
Bayesian model for simultaneous linear quantile regression. More specifically,
we propose to model the conditional distributions by using random probability
measures known as quantile pyramids. Unlike many existing approaches, our
framework allows us to specify meaningful priors on the conditional
distributions, whilst retaining the flexibility afforded by the nonparametric
error distribution formulation. Simulation studies demonstrate the flexibility
of the proposed approach in estimating diverse scenarios, generally
outperforming other competitive methods. The method is particularly promising
for modelling the extremal quantiles. Applications to linear splines and
extreme value analysis are also explored through real data examples.

essential task for spreading dynamics in complex networks, which will benefit
the promotion of technical innovations, healthy behaviors, new products, etc.
Focusing on degree correlated networks, we propose a preferential contact
strategy based on the local network structure and local informed density to
promote the information spreading. During the spreading process, an informed
node will preferentially select a contact target among its neighbors, basing on
their degrees or local informed densities. By extensively implementing
numerical simulations in synthetic and empirical networks, we find that when
only consider the local structure information, the convergence time of
information spreading will be remarkably reduced if low-degree neighbors are
favored as contact targets. Meanwhile, the minimum convergence time depends
non-monotonically on degree-degree correlation, and moderate correlation
coefficients result in most efficient information spreading. Incorporating the
informed density information into contact strategy, the convergence time of
information spreading can be further reduced. Finally, we show that by using
local informed density is more effective as compared with the global case.

better performance than traditional count-based distributional models, and (2)
a general model for the whole vocabulary is jointly trained to induce sense
centroids under the mutlitask learning framework. Evaluated on SemEval-2010 WSI

the plasma density, temperature, plasma beta, magnetic field near the source
region, the energy of energetic electrons and the distance between the
acceleration region and the emission start sites of type III bursts. From the
diagnostics, we find that: (1) The plasma density, temperature, magnetic field,
and the distance between the acceleration region and the emission start sites
almost have no obvious variations during the period of type III pair trains,
while the energy of electrons has an obvious peak value which is consistent to
the hard X-ray emission. (2) The plasma beta is much higher than an unity
showing a highly dynamic process near the emission start site of type III
bursts. (3) Although the reversed-slope type III branches drift slower at one
order of magnitude than that of the normal type III branches, the related
downgoing and upgoing electrons still could have same order of magnitude of
energy. These facts indicate that both of the upgoing and downgoing electrons
are possibly accelerated by similar mechanism and in a small source region.

  Detection",,,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Robust face detection in the wild is one of the ultimate components to
support various facial related problems, i.e. unconstrained face recognition,
facial periocular recognition, facial landmarking and pose estimation, facial
expression recognition, 3D facial model construction, etc. Although the face
detection problem has been intensely studied for decades with various
commercial applications, it still meets problems in some real-world scenarios
due to numerous challenges, e.g. heavy facial occlusions, extremely low
resolutions, strong illumination, exceptionally pose variations, image or video
compression artifacts, etc. In this paper, we present a face detection approach
named Contextual Multi-Scale Region-based Convolution Neural Network (CMS-RCNN)
to robustly solve the problems mentioned above. Similar to the region-based
CNNs, our proposed network consists of the region proposal component and the
region-of-interest (RoI) detection component. However, far apart of that
network, there are two main contributions in our proposed network that play a
significant role to achieve the state-of-the-art performance in face detection.
Firstly, the multi-scale information is grouped both in region proposal and RoI
detection to deal with tiny face regions. Secondly, our proposed network allows
explicit body contextual reasoning in the network inspired from the intuition
of human vision system. The proposed approach is benchmarked on two recent
challenging face detection databases, i.e. the WIDER FACE Dataset which
contains high degree of variability, as well as the Face Detection Dataset and
Benchmark (FDDB). The experimental results show that our proposed approach
trained on WIDER FACE Dataset outperforms strong baselines on WIDER FACE
Dataset by a large margin, and consistently achieves competitive results on
FDDB against the recent state-of-the-art face detection methods.

(GF-1) optical satellite has a 16-m resolution and four-day revisit cycle for
large-scale Earth observation. The advantages of the high temporal-spatial
resolution and the wide field of view make the GF-1 WFV imagery very popular.
However, cloud cover is an inevitable problem in GF-1 WFV imagery, which
influences its precise application. Accurate cloud and cloud shadow detection
in GF-1 WFV imagery is quite difficult due to the fact that there are only
three visible bands and one near-infrared band. In this paper, an automatic
multi-feature combined (MFC) method is proposed for cloud and cloud shadow
detection in GF-1 WFV imagery. The MFC algorithm first implements threshold
segmentation based on the spectral features and mask refinement based on guided
filtering to generate a preliminary cloud mask. The geometric features are then
used in combination with the texture features to improve the cloud detection
results and produce the final cloud mask. Finally, the cloud shadow mask can be
acquired by means of the cloud and shadow matching and follow-up correction
process. The method was validated using 108 globally distributed scenes. The
results indicate that MFC performs well under most conditions, and the average
overall accuracy of MFC cloud detection is as high as 96.8%. In the contrastive
analysis with the official provided cloud fractions, MFC shows a significant
improvement in cloud fraction estimation, and achieves a high accuracy for the
cloud and cloud shadow detection in the GF-1 WFV imagery with fewer spectral
bands. The proposed method could be used as a preprocessing step in the future
to monitor land-cover change, and it could also be easily extended to other
optical satellite imagery which has a similar spectral setting.

programs, which contributes to the complexity of (weak) memory models. We show
using WMM, a new weak memory model, that the model becomes simpler if it
includes load-value speculation and thus, does not enforce any dependency!
However, in the absence of good value-prediction techniques, a programmer may
end up paying a price for the extra fences. Thus, we also present WMM-D, which
enforces the dependencies captured by the current microarchitectures. WMM-D is
still much simpler than other existing models. We also show that non-atomic
multi-copy stores arise as a result of sharing write-through caches. We think
restricting microarchitectures to write-back caches (and thus simpler weak
memory models) will not incur any performance penalty. Nevertheless, we present
WMM-S, another extension to WMM, which could model the effects of non-atomic
multi-copy stores. WMM, WMM-D, and WMM-S are all defined using Instantaneous
Instruction Execution (I^2E), a new way of describing memory models without

of DNA. It is still not clear how these proteins find their target locus. In
this study, the mean first-passage time (FPT) of protein binding to its target
locus on DNA chain is discussed by a chain-space coupled model. Our results
show that the 1-dimensional diffusion constant has a critical value, with which
the mean time spent by a protein to find its target locus is almost independent
of the binding rate of protein to DNA chain and the detachment rate from DNA
chain. Which implies that, the frequency of protein binding to DNA and the
sliding time on DNA chain have little influence on the search efficiency, and
therefore whether or not the 1-dimensional sliding on DNA chain increases the
search efficiency depends on the 1-dimensional diffusion constant of the
protein on DNA chain. This study also finds that only protein bindings to DNA
loci which are close to the target locus help to increase the search
efficiency, while bindings to those loci which are far from the target locus
might delay the target binding process. As expected, the mean FPT increases
with the distance between the initial position of protein in cell space and its
target locus on DNA chain. The direct binding probability, which can be
regarded as one index to describe if the 1-dimensional sliding along DNA chain
is helpful to increase the search efficiency is calculated. Our results show
that the influence of 1-dimensional sliding along DNA chain on the search
process depends on both diffusion constants of protein in cell space and on the

Computer Vision and Natural Language Processing communities, not least because
it offers insight into the relationships between two important sources of
information. Current datasets, and the models built upon them, have focused on
questions which are answerable by direct analysis of the question and image
alone. The set of such questions that require no external information to answer
is interesting, but very limited. It excludes questions which require common
sense, or basic factual knowledge to answer, for example. Here we introduce
FVQA, a VQA dataset which requires, and supports, much deeper reasoning. FVQA
only contains questions which require external information to answer.
  We thus extend a conventional visual question answering dataset, which
contains image-question-answerg triplets, through additional
image-question-answer-supporting fact tuples. The supporting fact is
represented as a structural triplet, such as <Cat,CapableOf,ClimbingTrees>.
  We evaluate several baseline models on the FVQA dataset, and describe a novel

Classical novae are thermonuclear explosions that take place in the
envelopes of accreting white dwarfs in stellar binary systems. The material
transferred onto the white dwarf piles up under degenerate conditions, driving
a thermonuclear runaway. In those outbursts, about 10-7 - 10-3 Msun, enriched
in CNO and, sometimes, other intermediate-mass elements (e.g., Ne, Na, Mg, or
Al, for ONe novae) are ejected into the interstellar medium. The large
concentrations of metals spectroscopically inferred in the nova ejecta reveal
that the (solar-like) material transferred from the secondary mixes with the
outermost layers of the underlying white dwarf.
  Aims. Most theoretical models of nova outbursts reported to date yield, on
average, outflows characterized by O > C, from which only oxidized condensates
(e.g, O-rich grains) would be expected, in principle.
  Methods. To specifically address whether CO novae can actually produce C-rich
dust, six different hydrodynamic nova models have been evolved, from accretion
to the expansion and ejection stages, with different choices for the
composition of the substrate with which the solar-like accreted material mixes.
Updated chemical profiles inside the H-exhausted core have been used, based on
stellar evolution calculations for a progenitor of 8 Msun through H and
He-burning phases.
  Results. We show that these profiles lead to C-rich ejecta after the nova
outburst. This extends the possible contribution of novae to the inventory of
presolar grains identified in meteorites, particularly in a number of
carbonaceous phases (i.e., nanodiamonds, silicon carbides and graphites).

bilayer splitting rather than from the Fermi-surface warping. The SlO frequency

Nonetheless, these tools are often very rigid in dealing with with Event Logs

the ability of handling incomplete event data is one of the challenges

mirror-instability threshold) under the topology-conservation constraint
evolves into a kind of diamagnetic ""bubble"". This can take two forms: either
the plasma body greatly expands in radius while containing the same magnetic
flux, or, if the plasma radius is limited, the plasma distribution across
flux-tubes changes, so that the same cross-section contains a greatly reduced
flux. If the magnetic field of the trap is quasi-uniform around its minimum,
the bubble can be made roughly cylindrical, with radius much larger than the
radius of the corresponding vacuum flux-tube, and with non-paraxial ends. Then
the effective mirror ratio of the diamagnetic trap becomes very large, but the
cross-field transport increases. The confinement time can be found from
solution of the system of equilibrium and transport equations and is shown to
be $\tau_E\approx\sqrt{\tau_\parallel\tau_\perp}$. If the cross-field
confinement is not too degraded by turbulence, this estimate in principle
allows construction of relatively compact fusion reactors with lengths in the
range of a few tens of meters. In many ways the described here diamagnetic
confinement and the corresponding reactor parameters are similar to those
claimed by the FRCs.

solid at the macroscopic scale; however, recent experiments and simulations
indicate that MGs contain nano-scale elastic heterogeneities. Despite the
fundamental importance of these findings, a quantitative understanding is still
lacking for the local elastic heterogeneities intrinsic to MGs. On the basis of
Eshelby's theory, here we develop a micromechanical model that correlates the
properties of the local elastic heterogeneities, being very difficult to
measure experimentally, to the measurable overall elastic properties of MGs,
such as shear/bulk modulus and Poisson's ratio. Our theoretical modeling is
verified by the experimental data obtained from various MGs annealed to
different degrees. Particularly, we revealed that the decrease of Poisson's
ratio upon annealing of MGs is associated with a much large shear softening
over hydrostatic-pressure softening, and $vice$ $versa$ in local elastic
inhomogeneities. The relative extent of the bulk versus shear modulus softens
is extracted for different MGs, and is found to closely depend on the specific
composition and their ductility. The implication of our results on the
Poisson's ratio criterion on the ductility as well as the aging dynamics in MGs
is discussed.

objects showing a FR II radio morphology; a large fraction (70%) of the sample
is made of radiative mode or High Excitation Radio Galaxies (HERG). We have
measured the source size on NVSS, FIRST and SUMSS images and have compared our
findings with data in the literature obtaining a good match. We surprisingly
found that the soft gamma-ray selection favours the detection of large size
radio galaxies: 60% of objects in the sample have size greater than 0.4 Mpc
while around 22% reach dimension above 0.7 Mpc at which point they are
classified as Giant Radio Galaxies or GRGs, the largest and most energetic
single entities in the Universe. Their fraction among soft gamma ray selected
radio galaxies is significantly larger than typically found in radio surveys,
where only a few percent of objects (1-6%) are GRGs. This may partly be due to
observational biases affecting radio surveys more than soft gamma ray surveys,
thus disfavouring the detection of GRGs at lower frequencies. The main reasons
and/or conditions leading to the formation of these large radio structures are
still unclear with many parameters such as high jet power, long activity time
and surrounding environment all playing a role; the first two may be linked to
the type of AGN discussed in this work and partly explain the high fraction of
GRGs found in the present sample. Our result suggests that high energy surveys
may be a more efficient way than radio surveys to find these peculiar objects.

first is an adaption of the parallel breadth first search in the SPIN model
checker. We show that the adapted algorithm does not provide the desired load
balancing for many hybrid systems benchmarks. The second is a task parallel
algorithm based on cheaply precomputing cost of post (continuous and discrete)
operations for effective load balancing. We illustrate the task parallel
algorithm and the cost precomputation of post operators on a
support-function-based algorithm for state-space exploration. The performance
comparison of the two algorithms displays a better CPU
utilization/load-balancing of the second over the first, except for certain
cases. The algorithms are implemented in the model checker XSpeed and our
experiments show a maximum speed-up of $900\times$ on a navigation benchmark
with respect to SpaceEx LGG scenario, comparing on the basis of equal number of
post operations evaluated.

constructed for studying exoplanetary atmospheres. In its initial version, the
model atmospheres of HELIOS are one-dimensional and plane-parallel, and the
equation of radiative transfer is solved in the two-stream approximation with
non-isotropic scattering. A small set of the main infrared absorbers is
employed, computed with the opacity calculator HELIOS-K and combined using a
correlated-$k$ approximation. The molecular abundances originate from validated
analytical formulae for equilibrium chemistry. We compare HELIOS with the work
of Miller-Ricci & Fortney using a model of GJ 1214b, and perform several tests,
where we find: model atmospheres with single-temperature layers struggle to
converge to radiative equilibrium; $k$-distribution tables constructed with
$\gtrsim 0.01$ cm$^{-1}$ resolution in the opacity function ($ \lesssim 10^3$
points per wavenumber bin) may result in errors $\gtrsim 1$-10 % in the
synthetic spectra; and a diffusivity factor of 2 approximates well the exact
radiative transfer solution in the limit of pure absorption. We construct
""null-hypothesis"" models (chemical equilibrium, radiative equilibrium and solar
element abundances) for 6 hot Jupiters. We find that the dayside emission
spectra of HD 189733b and WASP-43b are consistent with the null hypothesis,
while it consistently under-predicts the observed fluxes of WASP-8b, WASP-12b,
WASP-14b and WASP-33b. We demonstrate that our results are somewhat insensitive
to the choice of stellar models (blackbody, Kurucz or PHOENIX) and metallicity,
but are strongly affected by higher carbon-to-oxygen ratios. The code is

illustrations of this. We apply these ideas to stationary univariate and
multivariate time series to measure lagged auto- and cross-dependence in a time

the sample auto- and cross-distance correlation functions. We also apply the
auto-distance correlation function (ADCF) to the residuals of an autoregressive
processes as a test of goodness of fit. Under the null that an autoregressive
model is true, the limit distribution of the empirical ADCF can differ markedly
from the corresponding one based on an iid sequence. We illustrate the use of

three non-ordinary symmetries (such as time reversal, charge conjugation and

arbitrary $N$-body interactions in each of the ten classes. We show that the
space of $N$-body Hamiltonians has an affine subspace (of a vector space)
structure in classes which have either or both charge conjugation and

of CS masses in the sample of compact PNe is different than sample in the LMC

on term substitution, and coefficients from an abelian group $G$. Then, $E$ is
valid in $N$ iff $E$ is valid in each reachable marking of $N$ . Due to the
expressive power of Algebraic Petri nets, validity is generally undecidable.
Stable linear equations form a class of linear equations for which validity is
decidable. Place invariants yield a well-understood but incomplete
characterization of all stable linear equations. In this paper, we provide a
complete characterization of stability for the subclass of homogeneous linear
equations, by restricting ourselves to the interpretation of terms over the
Herbrand structure without considering further equality axioms. Based thereon,
we show that stability is decidable for homogeneous linear equations if $G$ is

prediction part includes functions like optimum window size selection for

important when characterizing the underlying stellar dynamo. It has been
suggested that anti-solar DR laws can occur when strong meridional flows exist.
We aim to investigate the differential surface rotation on the primary star of
the RS CVn binary HU Vir by tracking its starspot distribution as a function of
time. We also aim to recompute and update the values for several system
parameters of the triple system HU Vir (close and wide orbits). Time-series
high-resolution spectroscopy for four continuous months was obtained with the
1.2-m robotic STELLA telescope. Nine consecutive Doppler images were
reconstructed from these data, using our line-profile inversion code iMap. An
image cross-correlation method was applied to derive the surface
differential-rotation law for HU Vir. New orbital elements for the close and
the wide orbits were computed using our new STELLA radial velocities (RVs)
combined with the RV data available in the literature. Photometric observations
were performed with the Amadeus Automatic Photoelectric Telescope (APT),
providing contemporaneous Johnson-Cousins $V$ and $I$ data for approximately 20
years. This data was used to determine the stellar rotation period and the
active longitudes. We confirm anti-solar DR with a surface shear parameter
$\alpha$ of -0.029 $\pm$ 0.005 and -0.026 $\pm$ 0.009, using single-term and
double-term differential rotation laws, respectively. The best fit is achieved

be interaction debris, little research has been done on the formation of

is that such features result from the fragmentation of more extended streams,
while another idea is that they are primordial, optically dark galaxies. We
test the validity of the fragmentation scenario (via harassment) using
numerical simulations. In order to compare our numerical models with
observations, we present catalogues of both the known long HI streams (42
objects) and free-floating HI clouds suggested as dark galaxy candidates (51
objects). In particular, we investigate whether it is possible to form compact
features with high velocity widths (> 100 km/s), similar to observed clouds
which are otherwise intriguing dark galaxy candidates. We find that producing
such features is possible but extremely unlikely, occurring no more than 0.2%
of the time in our simulations. In contrast, we find that genuine dark galaxies
could be extremely stable to harassment and remain detectable even after 5 Gyr
in the cluster environment (with the important caveat that our simulations only
explore harassment and do not yet include the intracluster medium, heating and
cooling, or star formation). We also discuss the possibility that such objects
could be the progenitors of recently discovered ultra diffuse galaxies.

radio morphology and are characterized by high 20-100 keV luminosities (from
10^42 to 10^46 erg/s) and high Eddington ratios (Log L_{Bol}/L_{Edd} typically
larger than ~0.01). The observed fraction of absorbed AGN (N_{H} > 10^{22}

majority of obscured AGN are narrow line objects, while unobscured AGN are
broad line objects, obeying to the zeroth-order predictions of unified models.
A significant anti-correlation between the radio core dominance parameter and
the X-ray column density is found. The observed fraction of Compton thick AGN
is ~2-3%, in comparison with the 5-7% found in radio-quiet hard X-ray selected
AGN. We have estimated the absorption and Compton thick fractions in a hard
X-ray sample containing both radio galaxies and non-radio galaxies and
therefore affected by the same selection biases. No statistical significant
difference was found in the absorption properties of radio galaxies and non

missing in both samples and the fraction of obscured radio galaxies appears to
decrease with luminosity as observed in hard X-ray non-radio galaxies.

meson BCS liquid phase, which is confirmed by second-order analytical

undergoes a phase transition to a charge density wave of single-site (spin-0)
mesons via spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking. At finite densities, the
chiral symmetry is restored almost everywhere, and the meson BCS liquid becomes
a simple liquid at strong couplings, with the exception of filling two-thirds,

nanorods (GNR) is investigated at the single object level, combining
polarization resolved TPL and simultaneously acquired topography. A very high
dependence of the TPL signal with both the nanorods longitudinal axis and the
incident wavelength is observed confirming the plasmonic origin of the signal
and pointing the limit of the analogy between GNRs and molecules. The spectral
analysis of the TPL evidences two emission bands peaks: in the visible (in
direct connection with the gold band structure), and in the infrared. Both
bands are observed to vary quadradically with the incident excitation beam but
exhibit different polarization properties. The maximum two-photon brightness of
a single GNR is measured to be a few millions higher than the two-photon
brightness of fluorescein molecules. We show that the important TPL observed in
these small gold nanorods results from resonance effects both at the excitation
and emission level : local field enhancement at the longitudinal surface
plasmon resonances (LSPR) first results in an increase of the electron-hole
generation. Further relaxation of electron-hole pairs then mostly leads to the
excitation of the GNR transverse plasmon mode and its subsequent radiative
relaxation.

Instead, one
has access to multiple corrupted versions of the signal. The available
corrupted signals are correlated because they carry information about the
common remote signal. The goal is to reconstruct the original signal from the
data collected from its corrupted versions. The information theoretic
formulation of the remote reconstruction problem assumes that the corrupted
signals are uniformly sampled and the focus is on optimal compression of the
samples. In this paper we revisit this problem from a sampling perspective. We
look at the problem of finding the best sampling locations for each signal to
minimize the total reconstruction distortion of the remote signal. In finding
the sampling locations, one can take advantage of the correlation among the
corrupted signals. Our main contribution is a fundamental lower bound on the
reconstruction distortion for any arbitrary nonuniform sampling strategy. This
lower bound is valid for any sampling rate. Furthermore, it is tight and
matches the optimal reconstruction distortion in low and high sampling rates.
Moreover, it is shown that in the low sampling rate region, it is optimal to
use a certain nonuniform sampling scheme on all the signals. On the other hand,
in the high sampling rate region, it is optimal to uniformly sample all the
signals. We also consider the problem of finding the optimal sampling locations
to recover the set of corrupted signals, rather than the remote signal. Unlike
the information theoretic formulation of the problem in which these two
problems were equivalent, we show that they are not equivalent in our setting.

charged compact objects, respectively. For Higgs type models, we find that

  Behavior-Regressed Connectivity","21 pages, 5 figures",,,,"q-bio.NC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Background: During an experimental session, behavioral performance
fluctuates, yet most neuroimaging analyses of functional connectivity derive a
single connectivity pattern. These conventional connectivity approaches assume
that since the underlying behavior of the task remains constant, the
connectivity pattern is also constant.
  New Method: We introduce a novel method, behavior-regressed connectivity
(BRC), to directly examine behavioral fluctuations within an experimental
session and capture their relationship to changes in functional connectivity.
This method employs the weighted phase lag index (WPLI) applied to a window of
trials with a weighting function. Using two datasets, the BRC results are
compared to conventional connectivity results during two time windows: the one
second before stimulus onset to identify predictive relationships, and the one
second after onset to capture task-dependent relationships.
  Results: In both tasks, we replicate the expected results for the
conventional connectivity analysis, and extend our understanding of the
brain-behavior relationship using the BRC analysis, demonstrating
subject-specific connectivity patterns that correspond to both positive and
negative relationships with behavior.
  Comparison with Existing Method(s): Conventional connectivity analyses assume
a consistent relationship between behaviors and functional connectivity, but
the BRC method examines performance variability within an experimental session
to understand dynamic connectivity and transient behavior.
  Conclusion: The BRC approach examines connectivity as it covaries with
behavior to complement the knowledge of underlying neural activity derived from
conventional connectivity analyses. Within this framework, BRC may be
implemented for the purpose of understanding performance variability both
within and between participants.

network is tensor train (TT) decomposition that acts as the building blocks for
the complicated tensor networks. However, the TT decomposition highly depends
on permutations of tensor dimensions, due to its strictly sequential

graphically interpreted as a cyclic interconnection of 3rd-order tensors, and
thus termed as tensor ring (TR) decomposition. The key advantage of TR model is
the circular dimensional permutation invariance which is gained by employing
the trace operation and treating the latent cores equivalently. TR model can be
viewed as a linear combination of TT decompositions, thus obtaining the
powerful and generalized representation abilities. For optimization of latent
cores, we present four different algorithms based on the sequential SVDs, ALS
scheme, and block-wise ALS techniques. Furthermore, the mathematical properties
of TR model are investigated, which shows that the basic multilinear algebra
can be performed efficiently by using TR representaions and the classical
tensor decompositions can be conveniently transformed into the TR
representation. Finally, the experiments on both synthetic signals and
real-world datasets were conducted to evaluate the performance of different
algorithms.

serendipitously extended detected sources from the third XMM-Newton

X-ray cluster candidates previously known in X-ray and/or optical bands from
the matched catalogues or NED. The catalogue consists of 54 systems with
redshift measurements in the range of 0.05-1.19 with a median of 0.36. Of
these, 45 clusters have spectroscopic confirmations as stated in the matched
catalogues. We spectroscopically confirmed another 6 clusters from the
available spectroscopic redshifts in the SDSS-DR12. The cluster catalogue
includes 17 newly X-ray discovered clusters, while the remainder were detected
in previous XMM-Newton and/or ROSAT cluster surveys. Based on the available
redshifts and fluxes given in the 3XMM-DR5 catalogue, we estimated the X-ray
luminosities and masses for the cluster sample. We also present the list of the
remaining X-ray cluster candidates (40 objects) that have no redshift

considered as distant cluster candidates beyond a redshift of 0.6. We also
searched for galaxy cluster mergers in our cluster sample and found two strong
candidates for newly discovered cluster mergers at redshifts of 0.11 and 0.26.
The X-ray and optical properties of these systems are presented.

high-density polyethylene matrix. This article reports on a novel methodology
developed for the conceptual design and optimisation of the 3He-tubes array,
aiming at the best possible performance in terms of neutron detection. The
algorithm is based on a geometric representation of two selected parameters of
merit, namely, average neutron detection efficiency and efficiency flatness, as
a function of a reduced number of geometric variables. The response of the
detection system itself, for each configuration, is obtained from a systematic
MC-simulation implemented realistically in Geant4. This approach has been found
to be particularly useful. On the one hand, due to the different types and
large number of 3He-tubes involved and, on the other hand, due to the
additional constraints introduced by the ancillary detectors for charged
particles and gamma-rays. Empowered by the robustness of the algorithm, we have
been able to design a versatile detection system, which can be easily
re-arranged into a compact mode in order to maximize the neutron detection
performance, at the cost of the gamma-ray sensitivity. In summary, we have
designed a system which shows, for neutron energies up to 1(5) MeV, a rather
flat and high average efficiency of 68.6%(64%) and 75.7%(71%) for the hybrid
and compact modes, respectively. The performance of the BRIKEN system has been
also quantified realistically by means of MC-simulations made with different

three identical patches, with distinct species having different types of patch.
Theoretically we assume tree-like clusters and calculate the bonding
probabilities using Wertheim's first-order perturbation theory for association.
For ternary mixtures we find up to eight fundamentally different percolated
states. The states differ in terms of the species and pairs of species that
have percolated. The strongest gel is a trigel or tricontinuous gel, in which
each of the three species has percolated. The weakest gel is a mixed gel in
which all of the particles have percolated, but none of the species percolates
by itself. The competition between entropy of mixing and internal energy of
bonding determines the stability of each state. Theoretical and simulation
results are in very good agreement. The only significant difference is the
temperature at the percolation threshold, which is overestimated by the theory
due to the absence of closed loops in the theoretical description.

can be influenced by the presence of a close-by orbiting planet. Moreover, the
interaction mechanisms that have been proposed, magnetic interaction and tidal
interaction, exhibit a very different dependence on orbital separation between
the star and the planet. A detection of activity enhancement and
characterization of its dependence on planetary orbital distance can, in
principle, allow us to characterize the physical mechanism behind the activity
enhancement.
  Methods: We used the HARPS-N spectrograph to measure the stellar activity
level of HD 80606 during the planetary periastron passage and compared the
activity measured to that close to apastron. Being characterized by an
eccentricity of 0.93 and an orbital period of 111 days, the system's extreme
variation in orbital separation makes it a perfect target to test our
hypothesis.
  Results: We find no evidence for a variation in the activity level of the
star as a function of planetary orbital distance, as measured by all activity
indicators employed log($R'_{HK}$), H$_\alpha$, NaI, and HeI. None of the
models employed, whether magnetic interaction or tidal interaction, provides a
good description of the data.
  Conclusions: We find no evidence for star-planet interaction in HD\,80606 at
the moment of the periastron passage of its very eccentric planet. The
straightforward explanation for the non-detection is the absence of interaction
as a result of a low magnetic field strength on either the planet or the star
and of the low level of tidal interaction between the two. However, we cannot
exclude two scenarios: i) the interaction can be instantaneous and of magnetic
origin, being concentrated on the substellar point and its surrounding area,
and ii) the interaction can lead to a delayed activity enhancement. (abridged)

with plenty of real world applications. In this paper we approach this topic
from the mathematical point of view by investigating an optimal boundary
control problem for a damage phase-field model for viscoelastic media. We
consider non-homogeneous Neumann data for the displacement field which describe
external boundary forces and act as control variable. The underlying
hyberbolic-parabolic PDE system for the state variables exhibit highly
nonlinear terms which emerge in context with damage processes. The cost
functional is of tracking type, and constraints for the control variable are
prescribed. Based on recent results from [M. H. Farshbaf-Shaker, C. Heinemann:
A phase field approach for optimal boundary control of damage processes in
two-dimensional viscoelastic media. Math. Models Methods Appl. Sci. 25 (2015),

lower level problem and existence of optimal controls of the upper level
problem have been established, we show in this contribution differentiability
of the control-to-state mapping, well-posedness of the linearization and
existence of solutions of the adjoint state system. Due to the highly nonlinear
nature of the state system which has by our knowledge not been considered for
optimal control problems in the literature, we present a very weak formulation
and estimation techniques of the associated adjoint system. For mathematical
reasons the analysis is restricted here to the two-dimensional case. We
conclude our results with first-order necessary optimality conditions in terms

numerical simulation of fluid flows. Among the various components of these
methods, the discretisation of the gradient operator has received less
attention despite its fundamental importance with regards to the accuracy of
the FVM. The most popular gradient schemes are the divergence theorem (DT) (or
Green-Gauss) scheme, and the least-squares (LS) scheme. Both are widely
believed to be second-order accurate, but the present study shows that in fact
the common variant of the DT gradient is second-order accurate only on
structured meshes whereas it is zeroth-order accurate on general unstructured
meshes, and the LS gradient is second-order and first-order accurate,
respectively. This is explained through a theoretical analysis and is confirmed
by numerical tests. The schemes are then used within a FVM to solve a simple
diffusion equation on unstructured grids generated by several methods; the
results reveal that the zeroth-order accuracy of the DT gradient is inherited
by the FVM as a whole, and the discretisation error does not decrease with grid
refinement. On the other hand, use of the LS gradient leads to second-order
accurate results, as does the use of alternative, consistent, DT gradient
schemes, including a new iterative scheme that makes the common DT gradient

  pages with many figures",,,,"math.GT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  This thesis is concerned with the question of when the double branched cover
of an alternating knot can arise by Dehn surgery on a knot in $S^3$. We
approach this problem using a surgery obstruction, first developed by Greene,
which combines Donaldson's Diagonalization Theorem with the $d$-invariants of
Ozsv{\'a}th and Szab{\'o}'s Heegaard Floer homology. This obstruction shows
that if the double branched cover of an alternating knot or link $L$ arises by
surgery on $S^3$, then for any alternating diagram the lattice associated to
the Goeritz matrix takes the form of a changemaker lattice. By analyzing the
structure of changemaker lattices, we show that the double branched cover of
$L$ arises by non-integer surgery on $S^3$ if and only if $L$ has an
alternating diagram which can be obtained by rational tangle replacement on an
almost-alternating diagram of the unknot. When one considers half-integer
surgery the resulting tangle replacement is simply a crossing change. This
allows us to show that an alternating knot has unknotting number one if and
only if it has an unknotting crossing in every alternating diagram.
  These techniques also produce several other interesting results: they have
applications to characterizing slopes of torus knots; they produce a new proof
for a theorem of Tsukamoto on the structure of almost-alternating diagrams of
the unknot; and they provide several bounds on surgeries producing the double
branched covers of alternating knots which are direct generalizations of
results previously known for lens space surgeries.
  The thesis begins with an exposition of the changemaker surgery obstruction,
giving an amalgamation of results due to Gibbons, Greene and the author. It
then gives background material on alternating knots and changemaker lattices.
The latter part of the thesis is then taken up with the applications of this
theory.

related to the amount of available information about additional registers
determining the choice of the measurement. We proceed to show that also for

We present results for misaligned homogeneous magnetic multilayers, including

domain walls --such as Holmium-- for the continuous case. Introducing a
rotating basis to disentangle the role of singlet and triplet correlations, we
demonstrate that substantial amounts of (so-called short range) singlet

domain wall via the cascade effect. We propose a classification of $0-\pi$
transitions of the Josephson current into three types, according to the
predominant pair correlations symmetries involved in the current. Properties of
exchange springs for an experimental study of the proposed effects are
discussed. The interplay between components of the Gor'kov function that are
parallel and perpendicular to the local magnetization lead to a novel
prediction about their role in a proximity system with a progressively twisting
