as the most general hypergeometric orthogonal polynomials. Instead of a
differential equation, they satisfy a second order Sturm-Liouville type
difference equation in terms of the Wilson divided-difference operator. This
suggests that in order to better understand the distinctive properties of
Wilson polynomials and related topics, one should use a function theory that is
more natural with respect to the Wilson operator. Inspired by the recent work
of Halburd and Korhonen, we establish a full-fledged Nevanlinna theory of the
Wilson operator for meromorphic functions of finite order. In particular, we
prove a Wilson analogue of the lemma on logarithmic derivatives, which helps us
to derive Wilson operator versions of Nevanlinna's Second Fundamental Theorem,
some defect relations and Picard's Theorem. These allow us to gain new insights
on the distributions of zeros and poles of functions related to the Wilson
operator, which is different from the classical viewpoint. We have also
obtained a relevant five-value theorem and Clunie type theorem as applications
of our theory, as well as a pointwise estimate of the logarithmic Wilson
difference, which yields new estimates to the growth of meromorphic solutions
to some Wilson difference equations and Wilson interpolation equations.

problem where each agent minimizes a global objective while enforcing network
proximity constraints. This formulation includes online consensus optimization
as a special case, but allows for the more general hypothesis that there is
data heterogeneity across the network. To solve this problem, we propose using
a stochastic saddle point algorithm inspired by Arrow and Hurwicz. This method
yields a decentralized algorithm for processing observations sequentially
received at each node of the network. Using Lagrange multipliers to penalize
the discrepancy between them, only neighboring nodes exchange model
information. We establish that under a constant step-size regime the
time-average suboptimality and constraint violation are contained in a
neighborhood whose radius vanishes with increasing number of iterations. As a
consequence, we prove that the time-average primal vectors converge to the
optimal objective while satisfying the network proximity constraints. We apply
this method to the problem of sequentially estimating a correlated random field

quantum information processing platform. A qubit encoded in the hyperfine
manifold of $^{87}$Rb atom is dynamically extracted from the static quantum
register by an auxiliary moving ODT and reinserted into the static ODT.
Previous experiments were limited by decoherences induced by the differential
light shifts of qubit states. Here we apply a magic-intensity trapping
technique which mitigates the detrimental effects of light shifts and
substantially enhances the coherence time to $225 \pm 21\,\mathrm{ms}$. The
experimentally demonstrated magic trapping technique relies on the previously
neglected hyperpolarizability contribution to the light shifts, which makes the
light shift dependence on the trapping laser intensity to be parabolic. Because
of the parabolic dependence, at a certain ""magic"" intensity, the first order
sensitivity to trapping light intensity variations over ODT volume is
eliminated. We experimentally demonstrate the utility of this approach and
measure hyperpolarizability for the first time. Our results pave the way for
constructing a scalable quantum-computing architectures with single atoms
trapped in an array of magic ODTs.

of a small number of forms, as described in a paper of Graham, Graham, and
Rhodes. Determining which of these forms arise in a given finite semigroup is
difficult, and no practical mechanism for doing so appears in the literature.
We present an algorithm for computing the maximal subsemigroups of a finite
semigroup given knowledge of its Green's structure, and the ability to
determine maximal subgroups of certain subgroups.
  For a finite semigroup $S$ represented by a generating set $X$, in many
examples, if it is practical to compute the Green's structure of $S$ from $X$,
then it is also practical to find the maximal subsemigroups of $S$ using the
algorithm we present. The generating set $X$ for $S$ may consist, for example,
of transformations, or partial permutations, of a finite set, or of matrices
over a semiring. In such examples, the time taken to determine the Green's
structure of $S$ is comparable to that taken to find the maximal subsemigroups.
  Certain aspects of the problem of finding maximal subsemigroups reduce to
other well-known computational problems, such as finding all maximal cliques in
a graph and computing the maximal subgroups in a group. The algorithm presented
comprises two parts. One part relates to computing the maximal subsemigroups of
a special class of semigroups, known as Rees 0-matrix semigroups. The other
part involves a careful analysis of certain graphs associated to the semigroup
$S$, which, roughly speaking, capture the essential information about the
action of $S$ on its $\mathscr{J}$-classes.

cosmology where the ratio between the scale factors of the two metrics is
algebraically determined. The Universe evolves from a matter dominated epoch to
a dark energy dominated era where the equation of state of dark energy can
always be made close to -1 now by appropriately tuning the graviton mass. We
also analyse the perturbative spectrum of the theory in the quasi static
approximation well below the strong coupling scale where no instability is
present and we show that there are five scalar degrees of freedom, two vectors
and two gravitons. In a cosmological FRW background for both metrics, four of
the five scalars are Newtonian potentials which lead to a modification of
gravity on large scales. In this scalar sector, gravity is modified with
effects on both the growth of structure and the lensing potential. In
particular, we find that the $\Sigma$ parameter governing the Poisson equation
of the weak lensing potential can differ from one in the recent past of the
Universe. Overall, the nature of the modification of gravity at low energy,
which reveals itself in the growth of structure and the lensing potential, is
intrinsically dependent on the couplings to matter and the potential term of
the vielbeins. We also find that the time variation of Newton's constant in the
Jordan frame can easily satisfy the bound from solar system tests of gravity.
Finally we show that the two gravitons present in the spectrum have a
non-trivial mass matrix whose origin follows from the potential term of

mixtures, close to their continuous demixing points (belonging to the so-called
model H' dynamic universality class), are studied computationally by combining
semi-grand canonical Monte Carlo simulations and large-scale molecular dynamics
(MD) simulations, accelerated by graphic processing units (GPU). The symmetric
binary liquid mixtures considered cover a variety of densities, a wide range of
compressibilities, and various interactions between the unlike particles. The
static quantities studied here encompass the bulk phase diagram (including both
the binodal and the $\lambda$-line), the correlation length, the concentration
susceptibility, the compressibility of the finite-sized systems at the bulk
critical temperature $T_c$, and the pressure. Concerning the collective
transport properties, we focus on the Onsager coefficient and the shear
viscosity. The critical power-law singularities of these quantities are
analyzed in the mixed phase (above $T_c$) and non-universal critical amplitudes
are extracted. Two universal amplitude ratios are calculated. The first one
involves static amplitudes only and agrees well with the expectations for the
three-dimensional Ising universality class. The second ratio includes also
dynamic critical amplitudes and is related to the Einstein--Kawasaki relation
for the interdiffusion constant. Precise estimates of this amplitude ratio are
difficult to obtain from MD simulations, but within the error bars our results
are compatible with theoretical predictions and experimental values for model
H'. Evidence is reported for an inverse proportionality of the pressure and the
isothermal compressibility at the demixing transition, upon varying either the
number density or the repulsion strength between unlike particles.

towards a larger or smaller number of clusters which is monotonic (directly or
inversely) in the number of clusters in candidate partitions. This type of bias
is caused by the functional form of the CVI model. For example, the popular
Rand index (RI) exhibits a monotone increasing (NCinc) bias, while the Jaccard
Index (JI) index suffers from a monotone decreasing (NCdec) bias. This type of
bias has been previously recognized in the literature. In this work, we
identify a new type of bias arising from the distribution of the ground truth
(reference) partition against which candidate partitions are compared. We call
this new type of bias ground truth (GT) bias. This type of bias occurs if a
change in the reference partition causes a change in the bias status (e.g.,
NCinc, NCdec) of a CVI. For example, NCinc bias in the RI can be changed to
NCdec bias by skewing the distribution of clusters in the ground truth
partition. It is important for users to be aware of this new type of biased
behaviour, since it may affect the interpretations of CVI results. The
objective of this article is to study the empirical and theoretical
implications of GT bias. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first
extensive study of such a property for external cluster validity indices.

stored in a database called a Concept Base. It sits between the highly
distributed neural architectures and the distributed information systems, with
the intention of bringing brain-like and computer systems closer together.
Concept Trees can grow from the semi-structured sources when consistent
sequences of concepts are presented. Each tree ideally represents a single
cohesive concept and the trees can link with each other for navigation and
semantic purposes. The trees are therefore also a type of semantic network and
would benefit from having a consistent level of context for each node. A
consistent build process is managed through a 'counting rule' and some other
rules that can normalise the database structure. This restricted structure can
then be complimented and enriched by the more dynamic context. It is also
suggested to use the linking structure of the licas system [15] as a basis for
the context links, where the mathematical model is extended further to define
this. A number of tests have demonstrated the soundness of the architecture.
Building the trees from text documents shows that the tree structure could be
inherent in natural language. Then, two types of query language are described.
Both of these can perform consistent query processes to return knowledge to the
user and even enhance the query with new knowledge. This is supported even
further with direct comparisons to a cognitive model, also being developed by
the author.

not, in general, identifiable in fully parameterized $2 \times 2$ Gaussian GRT
models. A recent extension of $2 \times 2$ GRT models (GRTwIND) was developed
to solve this problem and a conceptually similar problem with the simultaneous
identifiability of means and marginal variances in GRT models. Central to the
ability of GRTwIND to solve these problems is the assumption of universal
perception, which consists of shared perceptual distributions modified by
attentional and global scaling parameters (Soto et al., 2015). If universal
perception is valid, GRTwIND solves both issues. In this paper, we show that
GRTwIND with universal perception and subject-specific failures of decisional
separability is mathematically, and thereby empirically, equivalent to a model
with decisional separability and failure of universal perception. We then
provide a formal proof of the fact that means and marginal variances are not,
in general, simultaneously identifiable in $2 \times 2$ GRT models, including
GRTwIND. These results can be taken to delineate precisely what the assumption
of universal perception must consist of. Based on these results and related
recent mathematical developments in the GRT framework, we propose that, in
addition to requiring a fixed subset of parameters to determine the location
and scale of any given GRT model, some subset of parameters must be set in GRT
models to fix the orthogonality of the modeled perceptual dimensions, a central
conceptual underpinning of the GRT framework. We conclude with a discussion of
perceptual primacy and its relationship to universal perception.

based on the interplay between miscibility and inter-component repulsion. Armed
with this more general conceptual framework, we expand the notion of such
states to higher dimensions presenting the possibility of both vortex-antidark
states and ring-antidark-ring (dark soliton) states. We perform numerical
continuation studies, investigate the existence of these states and examine
their stability using the method of Bogolyubov-de Gennes analysis.
Dark-antidark and vortex-antidark states are found to be stable for broad
parametric regimes. In the case of ring dark solitons, where the

Particle (SEP) events often display differences that result in a decreasing
Fe/O ratio over time. The physical mechanisms behind this behaviour are not
fully understood, but these observational signatures provide important tests of
physical modelling efforts. Aims. In this paper we study the propagation of
iron and oxygen SEP ions using a 3D model of propagation which includes the
effect of guiding centre drift in a Parker spiral magnetic field. We derive
time intensity profiles for a variety of observer locations and study the
temporal evolution of the Fe/O ratio. Methods. We use a 3D full orbit test
particle model which includes scattering. The configuration of the
interplanetary magnetic field is a unipolar Parker spiral. Particles are
released instantaneously from a compact region at 2 solar radii and allowed to
propagate in 3D. Results. Both Fe and O experience significant transport across
the magnetic field due to gradient and curvature drifts. We find that Fe ions
drift more than O ions due to their larger mass-to-charge ratio, so that an
observer that is not magnetically well connected to the source region will
observe Fe arriving before O, for particles within the same range in energy per
nucleon. As a result, for the majority of observer locations, the Fe/O ratio
displays a decrease in time. Conclusions. We conclude that propagation effects
associated with drifts produce a decay over time of the Fe/O ratio,
qualitatively reproducing that observed in SEP event profiles.

light through and inside even the most strongly scattering materials. Typically
in wavefront shaping, light is focused in an area with the size of one speckle
spot. It has been shown that the intensity is not only increased in the target
speckle spot, but also in an area outside the optimized speckle spot.
Consequently, the total transmission is enhanced, even though only the
intensity in a single speckle spot is controlled. Here, we experimentally study
how the intensity enhancement on both interfaces of a scattering medium depends
on the optimization area on the transmission side. We observe that as the
optimization radius increases, the enhancement of the total transmitted
intensity increases. We find a concomitant decrease of the total reflected
intensity, which implies an energy redistribution between transmission and
reflection channels. In addition, we find a qualitative evidence of a
long-range reflection-transmission correlation. Our result is useful for
efficient light harvesting in solar cells, multi-channel quantum secure
communications, imaging, and complex beam delivery through a scattering medium.

3D-LIDAR, find applications in many fields ranging from sensory perception to
semantic segmentation and object detection. Upsampling is often based on
combining data from a monocular camera to compensate the low-resolution of a
LIDAR. This paper, on the other hand, introduces a novel framework to obtain
dense depth-map solely from a single LIDAR point cloud; which is a research
direction that has been barely explored. The formulation behind the proposed
depth-mapping process relies on local spatial interpolation, using
sliding-window (mask) technique, and on the Bilateral Filter (BF) where the
variable of interest, the distance from the sensor, is considered in the
interpolation problem. In particular, the BF is conveniently modified to
perform depth-map upsampling such that the edges (foreground-background
discontinuities) are better preserved by means of a proposed method which
influences the range-based weighting term. Other methods for spatial upsampling
are discussed, evaluated and compared in terms of different error measures.
This paper also researches the role of the mask's size in the performance of
the implemented methods. Quantitative and qualitative results from experiments
on the KITTI Database, using LIDAR point clouds only, show very satisfactory
performance of the approach introduced in this work.

shared use of research data, as raised following the new EU General Data
Protection Regulation, we seek to find alternate techniques that can balance
these two issues. In particular, we demonstrate that an existing epidemiologic
tool, specimen pooling, can be adapted as a privacy-preserving method to enable
data analysis while maintaining data confidentiality. Specimen pooling is a
cost-effective tool in studying the effect of an expensive-to-measure exposure
on a disease outcome, for both unmatched and matched case-control designs. We
propose the technique in a new context to analyze confidential data and
demonstrate that it can be successfully used to estimate OR of covariates based
on aggregate data when individual patient data cannot be shared.
  Methods: We demonstrate the application of specimen pooling based on
aggregate covariate level and show that aggregated covariate levels can be used
in a conditional logistic regression model to estimate individual-level odds
ratio parameters of interest. We then show how to adapt the technique as a
privacy-preserving method to analyze data from a matched case-control design. A
similar approach can be applied for an unmatched design and unconditional
logistic regression.
  Results: The parameter estimates from the standard conditional logistic
regression are compared to those based on aggregated data. The parameter
estimates are similar and have similar standard errors and confidence interval
coverage.
  Conclusions: Pooling can be used effectively to analyze confidential data
arising from distributed data networks and will be extremely useful in
pharmacoepidemiology.

previous related works, self-timed SCBCLA architectures and synchronous SCBCLA
architectures were realized using standard cells and FPGAs. In this work, we
deal with improved realizations of synchronous SCBCLA architectures designed in
a semi-custom fashion using standard cells. The improvement is quantified in
terms of a figure of merit (FOM), where the FOM is defined as the inverse
product of power, delay and area. Since power, delay and area of digital
designs are desirable to be minimized, the FOM is desirable to be maximized.
Starting from an efficient conventional carry lookahead generator, we show how
an optimized section-carry based carry lookahead generator is realized. In
comparison with our recent work dealing with standard cells based
implementation of SCBCLAs to perform 32-bit addition of two binary operands, we
show in this work that with improved section-carry based carry lookahead
generators, the resulting SCBCLAs exhibit significant improvements in FOM.
Compared to the earlier optimized hybrid SCBCLA, the proposed optimized hybrid
SCBCLA improves the FOM by 88.3%. Even the optimized hybrid CCLA features
improvement in FOM by 77.3% over the earlier optimized hybrid CCLA. However,
the proposed optimized hybrid SCBCLA is still the winner and has a better FOM
than the currently optimized hybrid CCLA by 15.3%. All the CCLAs and SCBCLAs

p-wave pairing in the presence of singlet superconductivity. This opens new

for ground states of local Hamiltonians. Recently, [Ambainis, CCC 2014] defined
the complexity class P^QMA[log], and motivated its study by showing that the
physical task of estimating the expectation value of a local observable against
the ground state of a local Hamiltonian is P^QMA[log]-complete. In this paper,
we continue the study of P^QMA[log], obtaining the following lower and upper
bounds.
  Lower bounds (hardness results): (1) The P^QMA[log]-completeness result of
[Ambainis, CCC 2014] requires O(log n)-local observables and Hamiltonians. We
show that simulating even a single qubit measurement on ground states of
5-local Hamiltonians is P^QMA[log]-complete, resolving an open question of
Ambainis. (2) We formalize the complexity theoretic study of estimating
two-point correlation functions against ground states, and show that this task
is similarly P^QMA[log]-complete. (3) We identify a flaw in [Ambainis, CCC
2014] regarding a P^UQMA[log]-hardness proof for estimating spectral gaps of
local Hamiltonians. By introducing a ""query validation"" technique, we build on
[Ambainis, CCC 2014] to obtain P^UQMA[log]-hardness for estimating spectral
gaps under polynomial-time Turing reductions.
  Upper bounds (containment in complexity classes): P^QMA[log] is thought of as
""slightly harder"" than QMA. We justify this formally by exploiting the
hierarchical voting technique of [Beigel, Hemachandra, Wechsung, SCT 1989] to
show P^QMA[log] is in PP. This improves the containment QMA is in PP [Kitaev,
Watrous, STOC 2000].
  This work contributes a rigorous treatment of the subtlety involved in
studying oracle classes in which the oracle solves a promise problem. This is
particularly relevant for quantum complexity theory, where most natural classes
such as BQP and QMA are defined as promise classes.

essential to have a multitude of antennas to generate sharp and strong beams

uniform planar array (UPA) antennas, which effectively place more antennas on a
two-dimensional grid. A hybrid beamforming setup is also considered to generate
beams by combining a multitude of antennas using only a few radio frequency
chains. We focus on designing a set of transmit beamformers generating beams
adapted to the directional characteristics of mmWave links assuming a UPA and
hybrid beamforming. We first define ideal beam patterns for UPA structures.
Each beamformer is constructed to minimize the mean squared error from the
corresponding ideal beam pattern. Simulation results verify that the proposed

W-valued distance and codistance functions. This work connects the twin
building of G and the Kac-Moody algebra g in a new geometrical way. The
Cartan-Chevalley involution, $\omega$, of g has fixed point real subalgebra, k,
the 'compact' (unitary) real form of g, and k contains the compact Cartan t = k

building of G into the lightcone of the compact real form k of g. Our embedding
gives a geometric model of part of the twin building, where each half consists
of infinitely many copies of a W-tessellated hyperbolic space glued together
along hyperplanes of the faces. Locally, at each such face, we find an
$SU(2)$-orbit of chambers stabilized by $U(1)$ which is thus parametrized by a
Riemann sphere $SU(2)/U(1)\cong S^2$. For n = 2 the twin building is a twin
tree. In this case, we construct our embedding explicitly and we describe the
action of the real root groups on the fundamental twin apartment. We also
construct a spherical twin building at infinity, and construct an embedding of

For simplicity, we focus on the case $k=2$, but our results extend naturally to

symmetry-reduction method tailored to our setting that allows for several
simplifications and a connection to flag algebras.
  We show that every symmetric polynomial that has a sos expression of a fixed

and not on the number of variables. Our method bypasses much of the technical
difficulties needed to apply the Gatermann-Parrilo method, and offers
flexibility in obtaining succinct sos expressions that are combinatorially
meaningful. As a byproduct of our results, we arrive at a natural
representation-theoretic justification for the concept of flags as introduced
by Razborov in his flag algebra calculus. Furthermore, this connection exposes
a family of non-negative polynomials that cannot be certified with any fixed

be operated in multiobject (MOS), long-slit, and integral field (IFU) mode with
spectral resolutions from 100 to 2700. Its MOS mode uses about a quarter of a
million individually addressable minislits for object selection, covering a
field of view of $\sim$9 $\mathrm{arcmin}^2$. Aims: The pipeline used to
extract wavelength-calibrated spectra from NIRSpec detector images relies
heavily on a model of NIRSpec optical geometry. We demonstrate how dedicated
calibration data from a small subset of NIRSpec modes and apertures can be used
to optimize this parametric model to the necessary levels of fidelity. Methods:
Following an iterative procedure, the initial fiducial values of the model
parameters are manually adjusted and then automatically optimized, so that the
model predicted location of the images and spectral lines from the fixed slits,
the IFU, and a small subset of the MOS apertures matches their measured
location in the main optical planes of the instrument. Results: The NIRSpec
parametric model is able to reproduce the spatial and spectral position of the
input spectra with high fidelity. The intrinsic accuracy (1-sigma, RMS) of the
model, as measured from the extracted calibration spectra, is better than 1/10
of a pixel along the spatial direction and better than 1/20 of a resolution
element in the spectral direction for all of the grating-based spectral modes.
This is fully consistent with the corresponding allocation in the spatial and
spectral calibration budgets of NIRSpec.

and social influence, the classical model for the dissemination of cultures
proposed by Axelrod predicts the existence of a fragmented regime where
different cultures can coexist in a social network. However, in such model the
multicultural regime is achievable only when a high number of cultural traits
is present, and is not robust against cultural drift, i.e. the spontaneous
mutations of agents' traits. In real systems, social influence is inherently
organised in layers, meaning that individuals tend to diversify their
connections according to the topic on which they interact. In this work we show
that the observed persistence of multiculturality in real-world social systems
is a natural consequence of the layered organisation of social influence. We
find that the critical number of cultural traits that separates the
monocultural and the multicultural regimes depends on the redundancy of
pairwise connections across layers. Surprisingly, for low values of structural
redundancy the system is always in a multicultural state, independently on the
number of traits, and is robust to the presence of cultural drift. Moreover, we
show that layered social influence allows the coexistence of different levels
of consensus on different topics. The insight obtained from simulations on
synthetic graphs are confirmed by the analysis of two real-world social
networks, where the multicultural regime persists even for a very small number
of cultural traits, suggesting that the layered organisation of social
interactions might indeed be at the heart of multicultural societies.

presents unique opportunity to study properties of high temperature
superconductivity of iron arsenic superconductors in absence of doping or
substitution. The Fermi surface consists of three hole pockets at $\Gamma$ and
two electron pockets at the $M$ point. We find that the values of the
superconducting gap are nearly isotropic, but significantly different for each
of the FS sheets. Most importantly we find that the overall momentum dependence
of the gap magnitudes plotted across the entire Brillouin zone displays a
strong deviation from the simple cos(kx)cos(ky) functional form of the gap
function, proposed in the scenario of the Cooper-pairing driven by a short
range antiferromagnetic exchange interaction. Instead, the maximum value of the
gap is observed for FS sheets that are closest to the ideal nesting condition
in contrast to the previous observations in some other ferropnictides. These

entropy of a minimally coupled scalar field in the Kerr black hole background.
We will use the brick wall model of t' Hooft. In the Kerr black hole,
complications arise due to the absence of a global timelike Killing field and
the presence of the ergosphere. Nevertheless, it is possible to calculate the
entropy of a thin shell of matter field in the near-horizon region using the
brick wall model. The corresponding leading order entropy of the
nonsuperradiant modes is found to be proportional to the area of the horizon
and is logarithmically divergent. Thus, the entropy of a three dimensional
system in the near-horizon region is proportional to the boundary surface. This
is similar to that of the black hole entropy itself. The corresponding internal
energy remains finite if the entropy is chosen to be of the order of the black
hole entropy itself. For a fixed value of the brick wall cut-off, the leading
order entropy in the Kerr black hole is found to be half of the corresponding
term in the Schwarzschild black hole. This is consistent with the preferential
emission of particles in the Kerr black hole with azimuthal angular momentum in
the same direction as that of the black hole itself. However, we can obtain the
Schwarzschild case expression by including a subleading term and taking the
appropriate limit. The results obtained in this article may be relevant to
entropy bound and holographic principle.

a fully Bayesian Markov Chain Monte Carlo method to fit the spectral energy
distributions (SEDs) of active galactic nuclei (AGN) from the sub-mm to the UV,
allowing one to robustly disentangle the physical processes responsible for
their emission. AGNfitter makes use of a large library of theoretical,
empirical, and semi-empirical models to characterize both the nuclear and host
galaxy emission simultaneously. The model consists of four physical emission
components: an accretion disk, a torus of AGN heated dust, stellar populations,
and cold dust in star forming regions. AGNfitter determines the posterior
distributions of numerous parameters that govern the physics of AGN with a
fully Bayesian treatment of errors and parameter degeneracies, allowing one to
infer integrated luminosities, dust attenuation parameters, stellar masses, and
star formation rates. We tested AGNfitter's performace on real data by fitting
the SEDs of a sample of 714 X-ray selected AGN from the XMM-COSMOS survey,
spectroscopically classified as Type1 (unobscured) and Type2 (obscured) AGN by
their optical-UV emission lines. We find that two independent model parameters,
namely the reddening of the accretion disk and the column density of the dusty
torus, are good proxies for AGN obscuration, allowing us to develop a strategy
for classifying AGN as Type1 or Type2, based solely on an SED-fitting analysis.
Our classification scheme is in excellent agreement with the spectroscopic
classification, giving a completeness fraction of $\sim 86\%$ and $\sim 70\%$,
and an efficiency of $\sim 80\%$ and $\sim 77\%$, for Type1 and Type2 AGNs,
respectively.

optical spectrum from Palomar. The infrared data imply a total rest-frame
1-1000$\mu$m luminosity of $5.5\times10^{46}$erg s$^{-1}$ and require both an
AGN torus and starburst model. The AGN torus has an anisotropy-corrected IR
luminosity of $4.9\times10^{46}$erg s$^{-1}$, and a viewing angle and half
opening angle both of approximately $36$ degrees from pole-on. The starburst
has a star formation rate of $(110\pm34)$M$_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$ and an age of
$<50$Myr. These results are consistent with two epochs of luminous activity in
09104: one approximately $150$Myr ago, and one ongoing. The X-ray data suggest
a photon index of $\Gamma \simeq 1.8$ and a line-of-sight column of $N_{\rm H}
\simeq 5\times10^{23}$cm$^{-2}$. This argues against a reflection-dominated
hard X-ray spectrum, which would have implied a much higher $N_{\rm H}$ and
luminosity. The X-ray and infrared data are consistent with a bolometric AGN
luminosity of $L_{\rm bol}\sim(0.5-2.5)\times10^{47}$erg s$^{-1}$. The X-ray
and infrared data are further consistent with coaligned AGN obscurers in which
the line of sight ""skims"" the torus. This is also consistent with the optical
spectra, which show both coronal iron lines and broad lines in polarized but
not direct light. Combining constraints from the X-ray, optical, and infrared
data suggests that the AGN obscurer is within a vertical height of $20$pc, and
a radius of $125$pc, of the nucleus.

general, are important unsolved problems in Galactic astronomy. Homogeneous
infrared observations of large samples of stars belonging to GCs and the
Galactic bulge field are one of the best ways to study these problems. We
report the discovery by APOGEE of a population of field stars in the inner
Galaxy with abundances of N, C, and Al that are typically found in GC stars.
The newly discovered stars have high [N/Fe], which is correlated with [Al/Fe]
and anti-correlated with [C/Fe]. They are homogeneously distributed across, and
kinematically indistinguishable from, other field stars in the same volume.
Their metallicity distribution is seemingly unimodal, peaking at [Fe/H]~-1,
thus being in disagreement with that of the Galactic GC system. Our results can
be understood in terms of different scenarios. N-rich stars could be former
members of dissolved GCs, in which case the mass in destroyed GCs exceeds that
of the surviving GC system by a factor of ~8. In that scenario, the total mass
contained in so-called ""first-generation"" stars cannot be larger than that in
""second-generation"" stars by more than a factor of ~9 and was certainly
smaller. Conversely, our results may imply the absence of a mandatory genetic
link between ""second generation"" stars and GCs. Last, but not least, N-rich
stars could be the oldest stars in the Galaxy, the by-products of chemical
enrichment by the first stellar generations formed in the heart of the Galaxy.

quantum spin liquids in frustrated magnets made of half-integer spins, which

group symmetries, we show that certain spinon symmetry fractionalization class
necessarily leads to a gapless spectrum. These gapless excitations are stable
against any perturbations, as long as the required symmetries are preserved.
Applying these gapless criteria to spin one-half systems on square, triangular

supernovae, iPTF14atg and iPTF14dpk, from the intermediate Palomar Transient
Factory. Although the two light curves resemble each other around and after
maximum, they show distinct early-phase rise behavior in the $\textit{r}$-band.
On the one hand, iPTF14atg revealed a slow and steady rise which lasted for 22
days with a mean rise rate of $0.2\sim0.3\,\textrm{mag}\,\textrm{day}^{-1}$,
before it reached the $R$-band peak ($-18.05\,$mag). On the other hand,
iPTF14dpk rose rapidly to $-17\,$mag within a day of discovery with a rise rate
$>1.8\,\textrm{mag}\,\textrm{day}^{-1}$, and then rose slowly to its peak
($-18.19\,$mag) with a rise rate similar to iPTF14atg. The apparent total rise
time of iPTF14dpk is therefore only 16 days. We show that emission from
iPTF14atg before $-17\,$days with respect to its maximum can be entirely
attributed to radiation produced by collision between the SN and its companion
star. Such emission is absent in iPTF14dpk probably because of an unfavored
viewing angle, provided that SN2002es-like events arise from the same
progenitor channel. We further show that a SN2002es-like SN may experience a

Galaxy clusters are continuously growing through the accretion of
matter in their outskirts. This process induces inhomogeneities in the gas
density distribution (clumping) which need to be taken into account to recover
the physical properties of the intracluster medium (ICM) at large radii. Aims.
We studied the thermodynamic properties in the outskirts (R > R500) of the
massive galaxy cluster Abell 2142 by combining the Sunyaev Zel'dovich (SZ)
effect with the X-ray signal. Methods. We combined the SZ pressure profile
measured by Planck with the XMM-Newton gas density profile to recover radial
profiles of temperature, entropy and hydrostatic mass out to 2R500. We used a
method that is insensitive to clumping to recover the gas density, and we
compared the results with traditional X-ray measurement techniques. Results.
When taking clumping into account, our joint SZ/X-ray entropy profile is
consistent with the predictions from pure gravitational collapse, whereas a
significant entropy flattening is found when the effect of clumping is
neglected. The hydrostatic mass profile recovered using joint X-ray/SZ data
agrees with that obtained from spectroscopic X-ray measurements and with mass
reconstructions obtained through weak lensing and galaxy kinematics.
Conclusions. We found that clumping can explain the entropy flattening observed
by Suzaku in the outskirts of several clusters. When using a method insensitive
to clumping for the reconstruction of the gas density, the thermodynamic
properties of Abell 2142 are compatible with the assumption that the thermal
gas pressure sustains gravity and that the entropy is injected at accretion
shocks, with no need to evoke more exotic physics. Our results highlight the
need for X-ray observations with sufficient spatial resolution, and large
collecting area, to understand the processes at work in cluster outer regions.

extra-galactic archaeology: they are luminous, occur in all stellar
populations, and their surface temperatures allow precise abundance
determinations for many different chemical elements. Yet, the full star
formation and enrichment history of a galaxy can be traced directly only if two
key observables can be determined for large stellar samples - age and chemical
composition. While spectroscopy is a powerful method to analyse the detailed
abundances of stars, stellar ages are the ""missing link in the chain"", since
they are not a direct observable. However, spectroscopy should be able to
estimate stellar masses, which for red giants directly infer ages provided
their chemical composition is known.
  Here we establish a new empirical relation between the shape of the hydrogen
line in the observed spectra of red giants and stellar mass determined from
asteroseismology. The relation allows to determine stellar masses and ages with
the accuracy of 10-15%. The method can be used with confidence for stars in the
following range of stellar parameters: 4000 < Teff < 5000 K, 0.5 < log g < 3.5,
-2.0 < [Fe/H] < 0.3, and luminosities log L/LSun < 2.5. Our analysis provides
observational evidence that the Halpha spectral characteristics of red giant
stars are tightly correlated with their mass and therefore their age. We also
show that the method samples well all stellar populations with ages above 1
Gyr. Targeting bright giants, the method allows to obtain simultaneous age and
chemical abundance information far deeper than would be possible with
asteroseismology, extending the possible survey volume to remote regions of the
Milky Way and even to neighbouring galaxies like Andromeda or the Magellanic
Clouds already with present instrumentation, like VLT and Keck facilities.

Following the formal analogy between QED and the description of low-energy

used to compute electron-hole pair creation driven by a circularly or linearly
polarized field. This is achieved via the coupled channel method, a numerical
scheme for the solution of the time-dependent Dirac equation in the presence of
bound states. The case of a monochromatic driving field is first considered,
followed by the more realistic case of a pulsed excitation. We show that the

uncertainties were assigned to different types of reactions involving nuclei

explosive trajectories for three different stellar models. It was found that
the grid of mass zones in the model of a 25 $M_\odot$ star, which is widely
used for investigations of $p$ nucleosynthesis, is too crude to properly
resolve the detailed temperature changes required for describing the production
of $p$ nuclei. Using models with finer grids for 15 $M_\odot$ and 25 $M_\odot$
stars with initial solar metallicity, it was found that most of the production
uncertainties introduced by nuclear reaction uncertainties are smaller than a
factor of two. Since a large number of rates were varied at the same time in
the Monte Carlo procedure, possible cancellation effects of several
uncertainties could be taken into account. Key rates were identified for each
$p$ nucleus, which provide the dominant contribution to the production
uncertainty. These key rates were found by examining correlations between rate
variations and resulting abundance changes. This method is superior to studying
flow patterns, especially when the flows are complex, and to individual,
sequential variation of a few rates.

challenges because most of the current methods for dietary assessment must rely

develop computer-aided technical solutions to enhance and improve the accuracy

aims to improve the accuracy of dietary assessment by analyzing the food images
captured by mobile devices (e.g., smartphone). The key technique innovation in
this paper is the deep learning-based food image recognition algorithms.
Substantial research has demonstrated that digital imaging accurately estimates
dietary intake in many environments and it has many advantages over other
methods. However, how to derive the food information (e.g., food type and
portion size) from food image effectively and efficiently remains a challenging
and open research problem. We propose a new Convolutional Neural Network
(CNN)-based food image recognition algorithm to address this problem. We
applied our proposed approach to two real-world food image data sets (UEC-256
and Food-101) and achieved impressive results. To the best of our knowledge,
these results outperformed all other reported work using these two data sets.
Our experiments have demonstrated that the proposed approach is a promising
solution for addressing the food image recognition problem. Our future work
includes further improving the performance of the algorithms and integrating
our system into a real-world mobile and cloud computing-based system to enhance
the accuracy of current measurements of dietary intake.

Spin coherence can give rise to spin mixing due to a number of processes such

it is not straightforward to differentiate between pure single-carrier
spin-dependent transport processes which control the current and therefore the
electroluminescence, and spin-dependent electron-hole recombination which
determines the electroluminescence yield and in turn modulates the current. We
therefore investigate the correlation between the dynamics of spin-dependent
electric current and spin-dependent electroluminescence in two derivatives of
the conjugated polymer poly(phenylene-vinylene) using simultaneously measured
pulsed electrically detected (pEDMR) and optically detected (pODMR) magnetic
resonance spectroscopy. This experimental approach requires careful analysis of
the transient response functions under optical and electrical detection. At
room temperature and under bipolar charge-carrier injection conditions, a
correlation of the pEDMR and the pODMR signals is observed, consistent with the
hypothesis that the recombination currents involve spin-dependent electronic
transitions. This observation is inconsistent with the hypothesis that these
signals are caused by spin-dependent charge carrier transport. These results
therefore provide no evidence that supports earlier claims that spindependent
transport plays a role for room temperature magnetoresistance effects. At low
temperatures, however, the correlation between pEDMR and pODMR is weakened,
demonstrating that more than one spin-dependent process influences the

present a theoretical investigation of a multi-terminal, multi-junction SQUID

continuous shift of the quantum interference pattern with respect to the

interacting self-mobile run-and-tumble disk-shaped particles with an underlying
periodic quasi-one-dimensional asymmetric substrate, and show that a rich
variety of collective active ratchet behaviors arise as a function of particle
density, activity, substrate strength, and substrate period. The ratchet
efficiency is nonmonotonic since the ratcheting is enhanced by increased
activity but diminished by the onset of self-clustering of the active
particles. Increasing the particle density decreases the ratchet efficiency for
weak substrates but increases the ratchet efficiency for strong substrates due
to collective hopping events. At the highest particle densities, the ratchet
motion is destroyed by a self-jamming effect. We show that it is possible to
realize reversals of the ratchet effect, where the net flux of particles is
along the hard rather than the easy direction of the substrate asymmetry. The
reversals occur in the strong substrate limit when multiple rows of active
particles can be confined in each substrate minimum, permitting emergent
particle-like excitations to appear that experience an inverted effective
substrate potential. We map out a phase diagram of the forward and reverse
ratchet effects as a function of the particle density, activity, and substrate
properties.

point of view starting from the extended Pareto distribution (EPD)
approximation to excesses over a high threshold, as developed in Beirlant et

goal is to maximize throughput, defined as average number of output voxels
computed per unit time. Other things being equal, processing a larger image
tends to increase throughput, because fractionally less computation is wasted
on the borders of the image. It follows that an apparently slower algorithm may
end up having higher throughput if it can process a larger image within the
constraint of the available RAM. We introduce novel CPU and GPU primitives for
convolutional and pooling layers, which are designed to minimize memory
overhead. The primitives include convolution based on highly efficient pruned
FFTs. Our theoretical analyses and empirical tests reveal a number of
interesting findings. For some ConvNet architectures, cuDNN is outperformed by
our FFT-based GPU primitives, and these in turn can be outperformed by our CPU
primitives. The CPU manages to achieve higher throughput because of its fast
access to more RAM. A novel primitive in which the GPU accesses host RAM can
significantly increase GPU throughput. Finally, a CPU-GPU algorithm achieves
the greatest throughput of all, 10x or more than other publicly available
implementations of sliding window 3D ConvNets. All of our code has been made

constraints. We give a precise description of the dynamics induced by the
individual strategies of players and of the corresponding costs, either when
the traffic is controlled by a planner, or when players act selfishly. In
parallel networks, optimal and equilibrium behavior eventually coincides, but
the selfish behavior of the first players has consequences that cannot be
undone and are paid by all future generations. In more general topologies, our
main contributions are three-fold.
  First, we show that equilibria are usually not unique. In particular, we
prove that there exists a sequence of networks such that the price of anarchy
is equal to $n-1$, where $n$ is the number of vertices, and the price of
stability is equal to 1.
  Second, we illustrate a new dynamic version of Braess's paradox: the presence
of initial queues in a network may decrease the long-run costs in equilibrium.
This paradox may arise even in networks for which no Braess's paradox was
previously known.
  Third, we propose an extension to model seasonalities by assuming that
departure flows fluctuate periodically over time. We introduce a measure that
captures the queues induced by periodicity of inflows. This measure is the
increase in costs compared to uniform departures for optimal and equilibrium

non-unital Leavitt path algebras as well, we generalize these
annihilator-related properties to locally unital rings and provide a more
general characterizations of Leavitt path algebras which are locally Rickart,
locally Baer, and locally Baer $*$-rings. Leavitt path algebras are also graded
rings and we formulate the graded versions of these annihilator-related
properties and characterize Leavitt path algebras having those properties as
well.
  Our characterizations provide a quick way to generate a wide variety of
examples of rings. For example, creating a Baer and not a Baer $*$-ring, a
Rickart $*$-ring which is not Baer, or a Baer and not a Rickart $*$-ring, is
straightforward using the graph-theoretic properties from our results. In
addition, our characterizations showcase more properties which distinguish
behavior of Leavitt path algebras from their $C^*$-algebra counterparts. For
example, while a graph $C^*$-algebra is Baer (and a Baer $*$-ring) if and only
if the underlying graph is finite and acyclic, a Leavitt path algebra is Baer
if and only if the graph is finite and no cycle has an exit, and it is a Baer
$*$-ring if and only if the graph is a finite disjoint union of graphs which
are finite and acyclic or loops.

the algorithm selects a vector from a decision set after which it receives a
noisy linear loss parameterized by an unknown vector. The goal in such a
problem is to minimize the (pseudo) regret which is the difference between the
total expected loss of the algorithm and the total expected loss of the best
fixed vector in hindsight. In this paper, we consider settings where the
unknown parameter has structure, e.g., sparse, group sparse, low-rank, which
can be captured by a norm, e.g., $L_1$, $L_{(1,2)}$, nuclear norm. We focus on
constructing confidence ellipsoids which contain the unknown parameter across
all rounds with high-probability. We show the radius of such ellipsoids depend
on the Gaussian width of sets associated with the norm capturing the structure.
Such characterization leads to tighter confidence ellipsoids and, therefore,
sharper regret bounds compared to bounds in the existing literature which are
based on the ambient dimensionality.

Near-infrared spectra presented here were obtained between 2015-07-14 and

centered on six different sub-observer longitudes were obtained through the Hbb

were fit to the aforementioned bands to obtain information on band center, band
depth, full width at half maximum, and band area. The shift in the band center
of the temperature-dependent 1.65 $\mu$m feature was used to calculate the
H$_2$O ice temperature. The mean temperature of the ice on the observable
portion of Charon's surface is 45$\pm$14 K and we report no statistically
significant variations in temperature across the surface. We hypothesize that
the crystalline and amorphous phases of water ice reached equilibrium over 3.5
Gyr ago, with thermal recrystallization balancing the effects of irradiation
amorphization. We do not believe that cryovolcanism is necessary to explain the
presence of crystalline water ice on the surface of Charon. Absorption from
ammonia species is detected between 12$^{\circ}$ and 290$^{\circ}$, in
agreement with results from New Horizons. Ongoing diffusion of ammonia through
the rocky mantle and upper layer of water ice is one possible mechanism for
maintaining its presence in Charon's surface ice. Reduced Charon spectra

spatial resolution of the multispectral data while simultaneously preserving
its spectral information. In this paper, we consider pansharpening as an
optimization problem minimizing a cost function with a nonlocal regularization
term. The energy functional which is to be minimized decouples for each band,
thus permitting the application to misregistered spectral components. This
requirement is achieved by dropping the, commonly used, assumption that relates
the spectral and panchromatic modalities by a linear transformation. Instead, a
new constraint that preserves the radiometric ratio between the panchromatic
and each spectral component is introduced. An exhaustive performance comparison
of the proposed fusion method with several classical and state-of-the-art
pansharpening techniques illustrates its superiority in preserving spatial
details, reducing color distortions, and avoiding the creation of aliasing

VIRUS-P Exploration of Nearby Galaxies (VENGA) survey, which provides high
spatial sampling and resolution (median ~ 387 pc), large coverage from the

spectral resolution (~ 120 km s^-1 at 5000 Ang.). Our results are: (1) We
present high resolution gas excitation maps to differentiate between regions
with excitation typical of Seyfert, LINER, or recent star formation. We find
LINER-type excitation at large distances (3-10 kpc) from the centre, and
associate this excitation with diffuse ionized gas (DIG). (2) After excluding
spaxels dominated by Seyfert, LINER, or DIG, we produce maps with the best
spatial resolution and sampling to date of the ionization parameter q, star
formation rate, and Z_gas using common strong line diagnostics. We find that
isolated barred and unbarred spirals exhibit similarly shallow Z_gas profiles
from the inner kpc out to large radii (7-10 kpc or 0.5-1.0 R_25). This implies
that if profiles had steeper gradients at earlier epochs, then the present-day
bar is not the primary driver flattening gradients over time. This result
contradicts earlier claims, but agrees with recent IFU studies. (3) The Z_gas
gradients in our z ~ 0 massive spirals are markedly shallower, by ~ 0.2 dex
kpc^-1, than published gradients for lensed lower mass galaxies at z ~ 1.5-2.0.
Cosmologically-motivated hydrodynamical simulations best match this inferred
evolution, but the match is sensitive to adopted stellar feedback
prescriptions.

where transceivers are confined in given lossy regions, is analyzed. First of
all, the regions confining the transceivers are assumed to be filled with
dielectric, which is either lossy or lossless. Then, for capacity analysis, we
use the exact power consumption that takes into account the electromagnetic
interaction between the field and the source. In addition, the exact noise
model followed from the fluctuation-dissipation theorem in thermodynamics is
used at the receive side. The contribution of our work is summarized as
follows. First, we characterize the channel capacity as a function of the size
and the physical property of the regions confining the transceivers and
analytically show how the radiation efficiency affects the capacity. We also
show that the outgoing channel at the transmit side and the incoming channel at
the receive side are information-theoretically equivalent, and thus, the
capacities of both channels are the same. Additionally, the quality factor,
which is inversely proportional to the bandwidth, is theoretically derived, and
the relationship between the spatial degrees of freedom of the channel and the
quality factor is analyzed. Besides, we consider how the power consumption is
affected by the backscattered waves and compare the recent experimental
demonstration with our work by solving the gain-optimization problem with the
constraint on the quality factor.

crossings within the Jaynes-Cummings ladder, with transitions mediated by terms
in the Hamiltonian that are typically ignored by the rotating wave

unexpected broken symmetry in the qubit potential. We confirm the theory by
measuring the photon occupation of the resonator when transitions occur while
varying the detuning between the qubit and resonator.

years. Multi-label classifiers have to address many problems including:
handling large-scale datasets with many instances and a large set of labels,
compensating missing label assignments in the training set, considering
correlations between labels, as well as exploiting unlabeled data to improve
prediction performance. To tackle datasets with a large set of labels,
embedding-based methods have been proposed which seek to represent the label
assignments in a low-dimensional space. Many state-of-the-art embedding-based
methods use a linear dimensionality reduction to represent the label
assignments in a low-dimensional space. However, by doing so, these methods
actually neglect the tail labels - labels that are infrequently assigned to
instances. We propose an embedding-based method that non-linearly embeds the
label vectors using an stochastic approach, thereby predicting the tail labels
more accurately. Moreover, the proposed method have excellent mechanisms for
handling missing labels, dealing with large-scale datasets, as well as
exploiting unlabeled data. With the best of our knowledge, our proposed method
is the first multi-label classifier that simultaneously addresses all of the

outperforms stateof-the-art multi-label classifiers by a large margin, in terms

temperature dependence of lattice thermal conductivity by assuming an inverse

formulate the cascade prediction problem as both classification and regression.
Then we compare three categories of cascade prediction methods: centrality

results show that feature based methods can outperform others in terms of
prediction accuracy but suffer from heavy overhead especially for large

on the left by an $m \times n$ matrix $\tilde G$ of i.i.d. Gaussian random
variables, but could not afford to do it because it was too slow? In this work
we propose a new randomized $m \times n$ matrix $T$, for which one can compute
$T \cdot X$ in only $O(\text{nnz}(X)) + \tilde O(m^2 \cdot d^{3})$ time, for
which the total variation distance between the distributions $T \cdot X$ and
$\tilde G \cdot X$ is as small as desired, i.e., less than any positive
constant. Here $\text{nnz}(X)$ denotes the number of non-zero entries of $X$.
Assuming $\text{nnz}(X) \gg m^2 \cdot d^{3}$, this is a significant savings
over the na\""ive $O(\text{nnz}(X) m)$ time to compute $\tilde G \cdot X$.
Moreover, since the total variation distance is small, we can provably use $T
\cdot X$ in place of $\tilde G \cdot X$ in any application and have the same
guarantees as if we were using $\tilde G \cdot X$, up to a small positive
constant in error probability. We apply this transform to nonnegative matrix
factorization (NMF) and support vector machines (SVM).

glacial flow model of solid nitrogen ice taking into account its published

layers flow laminarly and have low aspect ratios which permits a vertically
integrated mathematical formulation. We assess the conditions for the validity
of laminar nitrogen ice motion by revisiting the problem of the onset of
solid-state buoyant convection of nitrogen ice for a variety of bottom thermal
boundary conditions. Subject to uncertainties in nitrogen ice rheology,
nitrogen ice layers are estimated to flow laminarly for thicknesses less than
400-1000 meters. The resulting mass-flux formulation for when the nitrogen ice
flows as a laminar dry glacier is characterized by an Arrhenius-Glen functional
form. The flow model developed is used here to qualitatively answer some
questions motivated by observed glacial flow features found on Sputnik Planum.
We find that the wavy transverse dark features found along the northern
shoreline of Sputnik Planum may be a transitory imprint of shallow topography
just beneath the ice surface suggesting the possibility that a major shoreward
flow event happened relatively recently within the last few hundred years.
Model results also support the interpretation that the prominent darkened
features resembling flow lobes observed along the eastern shoreline of the
Sputnik Planum basin may be a result of wet nitrogen glacial ice flowing into
the basin from the pitted highlands of eastern Tombaugh Regio.

performs a comparative analysis of various classification techniques, such as
Na\""ive Bayes, LibSVM, J48, Random Forest, and JRip and tries to choose best

most accurate method in terms of students failure prediction and JRip is most
accurate in terms of students grade prediction. We also found that JRip
marginally differs from Na\""ive Bayes in terms of accuracy for students failure
prediction and gives us a set of rules from which we derive the key factors

these factors. This study is limited to Indian Education system scenarios.

(FFL) encoding scheme, projection data are usually acquired by moving the FFL
in a zigzag and a difference in the projection data occurs depending on the
scanning direction of FFL, resulting in blurring in the reconstructed images.
In this study, we developed a method for correcting the blur by deconvolution
using a signal-delay constant ({\xi}). The {\xi} value for correction ({\xi}c)
was determined by acquiring projection data in positive and negative directions
and searching for the {\xi} value which minimized the 2-norm between the
deconvolved projection data in the two directions. We validated our method
using a line and A-shaped phantoms for various velocities of FFL (vFFL). The
{\xi}c value correlated linearly with vFFL. The full width at half maximum of
the line phantom decreased significantly after correction of the blur. The
effectiveness of our method was also confirmed by the MPI images of the
A-shaped phantom. These results suggest that our method will be useful for
enhancing the reliability of projection-based MPI.

thermocapillary forces are the main driving force, this can have a tremendous

Recommendation System (RS) for Online Social Networks (OSNs). On OSNs, a user
switches roles constantly between content generator and content receiver. The
goals and softgoals are different when the user is generating a post, as
opposed as replying to a post. In other words, the user is generating instances
of different entities, depending on the role she has: a generator generates
instances of a ""post"", while the receiver generates instances of a ""reply"".
Therefore, we believe that when addressing Requirements Engineering (RE) for
RS, it is necessary to distinguish these roles clearly.
  We aim to model an essential dynamic on OSN, namely that when a user creates
(posts) content, other users can ignore that content, or themselves start
generating new content in reply, or react to the initial posting. This dynamic
is key to designing OSNs, because it influences how active users are, and how
attractive the OSN is for existing, and to new users. We apply a well-known
Goal Oriented RE (GORE) technique, namely i-star, and show that this language
fails to capture this dynamic, and thus cannot be used alone to model the
problem domain. Hence, in order to represent this dynamic, its relationships to
other OSNs' requirements, and to capture all relevant information, we suggest
using another modelling language, namely Petri Nets, on top of i-star for the
modelling of the problem domain. We use Petri Nets because it is a tool that is
used to simulate the dynamic and concurrent activities of a system and can be
used by both practitioners and theoreticians.

spikes, are known to be associated with solar flares. In order to understand
the particle beams responsible for the radio spike phenomena, evolution of
electron beam pulses injected from a solar flare region into the corona is
studied. Numerical integration of the Fokker-Planck (FP) equation is used to
follow the evolution of the electron beam pulse. The simulations show that the
short duration pulses lose most of their energy within a second of propagation
into the corona. Electron beam with a small low energy cut off is thermalised
faster than that with a high low energy cut off.

the highest citation increment in \Delta t years. We explore a series of
factors that can drive an author to be fast-rising and design a novel impact

Specifically, it outperforms all given benchmark methods, with over 8% average

different research topics follow the similar pattern. We also find that
temporal features are the best indicators for rising stars prediction, while
venue features are less relevant.

from the exotic electronic phases predicted and observed in the single- and
few-layer limit. Realizing these electronic phases requires preserving the
desired transport properties down to a monolayer, which is challenging. Here,
using semimetallic $WTe_2$ that exhibits large magnetoresistance, we show that
surface oxidation and Fermi level pinning degrade the transport properties of
thin $WTe_2$ flakes significantly. With decreasing $WTe_2$ flake thickness, we
observe a dramatic suppression of the large magnetoresistance. This is
explained by fitting a two-band model to the transport data, which shows that
mobility of the electron and hole carriers decreases significantly for thin
flakes. The microscopic origin of this mobility decrease is attributed to a ~ 2
nm-thick amorphous surface oxide layer that introduces disorder. The oxide
layer also shifts the Fermi level by ~ 300 meV at the $WTe_2$ surface. However,
band bending due to this Fermi level shift is not the dominant cause for the
suppression of magnetoresistance as the electron and hole carrier densities are
balanced down to ~ 13 nm based on the two-band model. Our study highlights the
critical need to investigate often unanticipated and sometimes unavoidable
extrinsic surface effects on the transport properties of layered

the magnetization at the interface when they are misaligned from the

new adaptation layer is proposed to reduce the mismatch between training and

objective is to minimize the number of transmissions by the macrocell base

satisfy quality-of-experience (QoE) of the clients. We first formulate this MBS
offloading problem as an optimization problem over a network coding graph, and
show that it is NP-hard. Therefore, we propose an ONC-broadcast offloading
scheme that exploits both broadcasting and opportunistic network coding (ONC)
to minimize the number of required MBS transmissions. We utilize a random graph
model to approximate the performance of the proposed ONC-broadcast scheme in
terms of the resultant average number of transmissions by the MBS. Moreover,
despite the complexity of finding the optimal solution for each and every case,
we prove that this ONC-broadcast scheme is asymptotically optimal, i.e., for
large number of requests, the ONC-broadcast scheme achieves a similar macrocell
offloading performance to that of the optimal solution. To implement the
ONC-broadcast scheme, we devise a heuristic that employs a dual conflict graph
or broadcasting at the FCs such that the remaining requests can be served using
the minimum number of transmissions at the MBS. Simulations show that the dual
graph scheme improves MBS offloading as compared to the traditional separate
graph scheme. Furthermore, the simple heuristic proposed to implement the
ONC-broadcast scheme achieves a very close performance to the optimal

scattering operators. Using this information and the ideas from the theory of
generalized wave operators, we present a new approach to the divergence
problems in quantum electrodynamics. We show that the so called infrared
divergences appeared because the deviations of the initial and final waves from
the free waves were not taken into account.

For this purpose, we propose the method to obtain derivative formulas by means

"1606.08219","Mark P. Davidson","Mark Davidson","On the M\""ossbauer effect and the rigid recoil question","19 pages, 4 figures","Found Phys (2017) 47: 327","10.1007/s10701-017-0064-9",,"physics.gen-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Various theories for the M\""ossbauer rigid-recoil effect, which enables a
crystal to absorb momentum but not appreciable energy, are compared. These
suggest that the recoil may not be instantaneous, and that the recoil time
could be used to distinguish between them. An experiment is proposed to measure
this time. The idea is to use a small sphere whose outer surface is coated with
an electrically charged M\""ossbauer-active element, and then to measure the
amount of energy lost due to Bremmsstrahlung during the recoil of this sphere
when a M\""ossbauer event occurs. As the energy radiated is proportional to the
square of the acceleration from Larmor's formula, the amount of energy so
radiated varies inversely proportional to the recoil time, and proportional to
the charge squared. Although this energy is quite small, it can in principle be
measured with the extreme sensitivity available in M\""ossbauer experiments. It
is found that the most information would be gained with more long-lived isomers
such as Rhodium-103m as the M\""ossbauer agent, and that correction terms to
Larmor's formula need to be considered due to the finite radius of a small
particle, and some of these corrections are included in the paper. These
corrections are taken from the extensive literature on radiating spherical
shells which were developed to analyze the Abraham-Lorentz model for a
classical charged particle. This problem is interesting because a perfectly
rigid crystal seems to pose questions about relativity, and because the
M\""ossbauer effect is a phenomenon where the solid-state environment
dramatically influences the probability of a nuclear process. Moreover, if the
experiment proposed can measure the recoil time, then such measurements might
provide a new class of analytical methods for material science and chemistry.

  3.9 (this is the final print version of this report on the issue of time
  directionality in fundamental theoretical physics)",,,,"physics.gen-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  This report offers a modern perspective on the question of time
directionality as it arises in a classical and quantum-mechanical context,
based on key developments in the field of gravitational physics. Important
clarifications are achieved regarding, in particular, the concepts of time
reversal, negative energy, and time-symmetric causality. From this analysis
emerges an improved understanding of the general-relativistic concept of
stress-energy of matter as being a manifestation of local variations in the
energy density of zero-point vacuum fluctuations. Based on those developments,
a set of axioms is proposed from which are derived generalized gravitational
field equations which actually constitute a simplification of relativity theory
in the presence of negative-energy matter and a non-zero cosmological constant.
Those results are then applied to provide original solutions to several
long-standing problems in cosmology, including the problem of the nature of
dark matter and dark energy, that of the origin of thermodynamic time
asymmetry, and several other issues traditionally approached using inflation
theory. Finally, we draw on those developments to provide significant new
insights into the foundations of quantum theory, regarding, in particular, the
problem of quantum non-locality, that of the emergence of time in quantum
cosmology, as well as the question of the persistence of quasiclassicality
following decoherence.
