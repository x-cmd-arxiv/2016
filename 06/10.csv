non-Gaussian setting, with non- Gaussian states employed either as entangled
inputs and/or as swapping resources. The quality of the swapping protocol is
assessed in terms of the teleportation fidelity achievable when using the
swapped states as shared entangled resources in a teleportation protocol. We
thus introduce a two-step cascaded quantum communication scheme that includes a
swapping protocol followed by a teleportation protocol. The swapping protocol
is fed by a general class of tunable non-Gaussian states, the squeezed Bell
states, which, by means of controllable free parameters, allows for a
continuous morphing from Gaussian twin beams up to maximally non-Gaussian
squeezed number states. In the realistic instance, taking into account the
effects of losses and imperfections, we show that as the input two-mode
squeezing increases, optimized non-Gaussian swapping resources allow for a
monotonically increasing enhancement of the fidelity compared to the
corresponding Gaussian setting. This result implies that the use of
non-Gaussian resources is necessary to guarantee the success of
continuous-variable entanglement swapping in the presence of decoherence.

Submitted to MNRAS Letters",,"10.1093/mnras/stw2172",,"astro-ph.EP astro-ph.SR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Recently it has been proposed that the zombie vortex instability (ZVI) could
precipitate hydrodynamical activity and angular momentum transport in
unmagnetised regions of protoplanetary discs, also known as ""dead zones"". In
this letter we scrutinise, with high resolution 3D spectral simulations, the
onset and survival of this instability in the presence of viscous and thermal
physics. First, we find that the ZVI is strongly dependent on the nature of the
viscous operator. Although the ZVI is easily obtained with hyper-diffusion, it
is difficult to sustain with physical (second order) diffusion operators up to
Reynolds numbers as high as 10^7. This sensitivity is probably due to the ZVI's
reliance on critical layers, whose characteristic lengthscale, structure, and
dynamics are controlled by viscous diffusion. Second, we observe that the ZVI
is sensitive to radiative processes, and indeed only operates when the Peclet
number is greater than a critical value ~10^4, or when the cooling time is
longer than ~10 Omega^{-1}. As a consequence, the ZVI struggles to appear at
R>0.3 AU in standard 0.01 M_sun T Tauri disc models, though younger more
massive disks provide a more hospitable environment. Together these results
question the prevalence of the ZVI in protoplanetary discs.

distinctive absorption features. For this reason, the surface composition of
these objects remains a subject of speculation. Spectra have revealed, however,
that the Jupiter Trojan asteroids consist of two distinct sub-populations which
differ in the optical to near-infrared colors. The origins and compositional
differences between the two sub-populations remain unclear. Here we report the
results from a 2.2-3.8 $\mu$m spectral survey of a collection of 16 Jupiter
Trojan asteroids, divided equally between the two sub-populations. We find
clear spectral absorption features centered around 3.1 $\mu$m in the less red
population. Additional absorption consistent with expected from organic
materials might also be present. No such features are see in the red
population. A strong correlation exists between the strength of the 3.1 $\mu$m
absorption feature and the optical to near-infrared color of the objects. While
traditionally absorptions such as these in dark asteroids are modeled as being
due to fine-grain water frost, we find it physically implausible that the
special circumstances required to create such fine-grained frost would exist on
a substantial fraction of the Jupiter Trojan asteroids. We suggest, instead,
that the 3.1 $\mu$m absorption on Trojans and other dark asteroids could be due
to N-H stretch features. Additionally, we point out that reflectivities derived
from WISE observations show a strong absorption beyond 4$\mu$m for both
populations. The continuum of 3.1 $\mu$m features and the common absorption
beyond 4 $\mu$m might suggest that both sub-populations of Jupiter Trojan

it has an optical gap of 1.9 eV. This makes it a prominent candidate for

remarkably different physical properties compared to bulk MoS$_2$ due to the
absence of interlayer hybridization. For instance, while the band gap of bulk

of layers. In this review, we analyze from a theoretical point of view the
electronic, optical, and vibrational properties of single-layer, few-layer and

number of layers, and applied tensile strain on the vibrational and optical

ab initio approaches. We also discuss which approximations are suitable for
MoS$_2$ and layered materials. The effect of external strain on the band gap of

investigated. We analyze the excitonic effects on the absorption spectra. The

to reconstruct the trajectory of a charged particle by collecting the

  This solution, compared to ""traditional"" tracking methods, exploits the
fastest information carrier within a material: the light. Therefore, an optical
tracking detector would be intrinsically capable of sustaining a very high

carriers diffusion, as happens in charge-transport based detectors. This new

search for extraterrestrial life and aids the planning of future telescopes.
Recent work has shown that planets near the outer edge of the habitable zone
might not actually be able to stay warm and habitable if CO$_2$ outgassing
rates are not large enough to maintain high CO$_2$ partial pressures against
removal by silicate weathering. In this paper I use simple equations for the
climate and CO$_2$ budget of a planet in the habitable zone that can capture
the qualitative behavior of the system. With these equations I derive an
analytical formula for an effective outer edge of the habitable zone, including
limitations imposed by the CO$_2$ outgassing rate. I then show that climate
cycles between a Snowball state and a warm climate are only possible beyond
this limit if the weathering rate in the Snowball climate is smaller than the
CO$_2$ outgassing rate (otherwise stable Snowball states result). I derive an
analytical solution for the climate cycles including a formula for their period
in this limit. This work allows us to explore the qualitative effects of
weathering processes on the effective outer edge of the habitable zone, which
is important because weathering parameterizations are uncertain.

newly measured in cosmic rays between ~10 MeV/nuc and 1 TeV/nuc. Voyager
measurements of this ratio at low energies and AMS-2 measurements at high
energies are used in this study. These measurements both considerably exceed at
both low and high energies the ratio predicted using a simple Leaky Box Model
for propagation of cosmic rays in the galaxy. Between 1-70 GeV/nuc, however,
this same model provides an excellent fit (within +2-3%) to the new AMS-2
measurements using an escape length ~P-0.45. This would imply a diffusion
coefficient ~P0.45, very close to the Kraichian cascade value of 0.50 for the
exponent. Extending this same diffusion dependence to high energies, still in a
LBM, along with a truncation of short path lengths in the galaxy will predict a
B/C ratio of 4.5% at ~800 GeV/nuc which is very close to the AMS-2 measurement
at that energy. This would indicate that the amount of material traversed near
the source in a Nested LBM, for example, is less than about 0.5 g/cm2 at these
energies since this process, with additional matter near the sources, would
increase the B/C ratio. At low energies, however, the B/C ratio of 14% +3% at
~10 MeV/nuc measured by Voyager is more difficult to explain. The same
parameters used in a LBM that fit the high energy B/C measurements predicts a
B/C ratio of only ~4% at 10 MeV/nuc where the path length is about 1.5 g/cm2.
If the cosmic rays have traversed ~10 g/cm2 of material in the galaxy at low
energies the prediction for B/C is still only 8%, which is between 2.0-3.0
sigma below the measurement and its errors.

accuracy in both space and time. They are based on a reconstruction procedure
and the solution of generalized Riemann problems. However, for general boundary
conditions, in particular of Dirichlet type, a lack of accuracy might occur if
a suitable treatment of boundaries conditions is not properly carried out. In
this work the treatment of Dirichlet boundary conditions for conservation laws
in the context of ADER schemes, is concerned. The solution of generalized
Riemann problems at the extremes of the computational domain, provides the
correct influence of boundaries. The reconstruction procedure, for data near to
the boundaries, demands for information outside the computational domain, which
is carried out in terms of ghost cells, which are provided by using the
numerical solution of auxiliary problems. These auxiliary problems are
hyperbolic and they are constructed from the conservation laws and the
information at boundaries, which may be partially or totally known in terms of
prescribed functions. The evolution of these problems, unlike to the usual
manner, is done in space rather than in time due to that these problems are
named here, {\it reverse problems}. The methodology can be considered as a
numerical counterpart of the inverse Lax-Wendroff procedure for filling ghost
cells. However, the use of Taylor series expansions, as well as, Lax-Wendroff
procedure, are avoided. For the scalar case is shown that the present procedure
preserve the accuracy of the scheme which is reinforced with some numerical
results. Expected orders of accuracy for solving conservation laws by using the
proposed strategy at boundaries, are obtained up to fifth-order in both space

dynamo wave and flux transport dynamo models. Very different parameter values
produce similar results, making it difficult to understand the origin of these
solar cycle properties. We use GONG helioseismic data to investigate the
progression of the solar cycle as observed in intermediate-degree global
$p$-mode frequency shifts at different latitudes and subsurface layers, from
the beginning of solar cycle 23 up to the maximum of the current solar cycle.
We also analyze those for high-degree modes in each hemisphere obtained through
the ring-diagram technique of local helioseismology. The analysis highlighted
differences in the progression of the cycle below 15\degr\ compared to higher
latitudes. While the cycle starts at mid-latitudes and then migrates
equatorward/poleward, the sunspot eruptions of the old cycle are still ongoing
below 15\degr\ latitude. This prolonged activity causes a delay in the cycle
onset and an overlap of successive cycles, whose extension differs in the two
hemispheres. Then the activity level rises faster reaching a maximum
characterized by a single peak structure compared to the double peak at higher
latitudes. Afterwards the descending phase shows up with a slower decay rate.
The latitudinal properties of the solar cycle progression highlighted in this
study provide useful constraints to discern among the multitude of solar dynamo

linearly with temperature in agreement with the Gr\""{u}neisen model. However,
below 100 K we observe nonlinear temperature-dependent frequency shifts in some
modes. We demonstrate that this anharmonic behavior is consistent with the
decay of an optical phonon into multiple acoustic phonons. Furthermore, the
highest frequency Raman modes show large changes in intensity and linewidth
near $T\approx 250$ K that correlate well with the $T_d \to 1T^\prime$
structural phase transition. These results suggest that phonon-phonon
interactions can dominate anharmonic contributions at low temperatures in bulk
$T_d$-MoTe$_2$, an experimental regime that is currently receiving attention in
efforts to understand Weyl semimetals.

variation of {\gamma}-ray spectra from both lobes. On the other hand, the
Planck observations at microwave frequencies contain important information on

model-independent derivation of the strength of the magnetic field and the

fixed number of degrees of freedom, neutrino parameter constraints do not
change significantly if the location of any features in the PPS are allowed to
vary, although neutrino constraints are more sensitive to PPS features if they
are known a priori to exist at fixed intervals in $\log k$. Although there is
no support for a non-standard neutrino sector from constraints on both neutrino
mass and relativistic energy density, we see surprisingly strong evidence for
features in the PPS when it is constrained with data from Planck 2015, SZ

Conversely combining Planck with matter power spectrum and BAO measurements
yields a much weaker constraint. Given that this result is sensitive to the

enough information in the gene sequences alone to accurately reconstruct the
correct ""gene tree."" Although the gene tree may deviate from the ""species tree""
due to a variety of genetic processes, in the absence of evidence to the
contrary it is parsimonious to assume that they agree. A common statistical
approach in these situations is to develop a likelihood penalty to incorporate
such additional information. Recent studies using simulation and empirical data
suggest that a likelihood penalty quantifying concordance with a species tree
can significantly improve the accuracy of gene tree reconstruction compared to
using sequence data alone. However, the consistency of such an approach has not
yet been established, nor have convergence rates been bounded. Because
phylogenetics is a non-standard inference problem, the standard theory does not
apply. In this paper, we propose a penalized maximum likelihood estimator for
gene tree reconstruction, where the penalty is the square of the
Billera-Holmes-Vogtmann geodesic distance from the gene tree to the species
tree. We prove that this method is consistent, and derive its convergence rate
for estimating the discrete gene tree structure and continuous edge lengths
(representing the amount of evolution that has occurred on that branch)
simultaneously. We find that the regularized estimator is ""adaptive fast

classify PTF12os as a Type IIb SN based on our spectral sequence; iPTF13bvn has
previously been classified as Type Ib having a likely progenitor with zero age
main sequence (ZAMS) mass below ~17 solar masses. Our main objective is to
constrain the explosion parameters of iPTF12os and iPTF13bvn, and to put
constraints on the SN progenitors.
  We present comprehensive datasets on the SNe, and introduce a new
reference-subtraction pipeline (FPipe) currently in use by the iPTF. We perform
a detailed study of the light curves (LCs) and spectral evolution of the SNe.
The bolometric LCs are modeled using the hydrodynamical code HYDE. We use
nebular models and late-time spectra to constrain the ZAMS mass of the
progenitors. We perform image registration of ground-based images of PTF12os to
archival HST images of NGC 5806 to identify a potential progenitor candidate.
  Our nebular spectra of iPTF13bvn indicate a low ZAMS mass of ~12 solar masses
for the progenitor. The late-time spectra of PTF12os are consistent with a ZAMS
mass of ~15 solar masses. We successfully identify a progenitor candidate to
PTF12os using archival HST images. This source is consistent with being a
cluster of massive stars. Our hydrodynamical modeling suggests that the
progenitor of PTF12os had a compact He core with a mass of 3.25 solar masses,
and that 0.063 solar masses of strongly mixed 56Ni was synthesized. Spectral
comparisons to the Type IIb SN 2011dh indicate that the progenitor of PTF12os
was surrounded by a hydrogen envelope with a mass lower than 0.02 solar masses.
We also find tentative evidence that the progenitor of iPTF13bvn could have
been surrounded by a small amount of hydrogen.

in much better agreement with observations. Only AGN feedback allows massive
galaxies at the centre of groups and clusters to become ellipticals, while
without AGN feedback those galaxies reform discs. It is the merger-enhanced AGN
activity that is able to freeze the morphological type of the post-merger
remnant by durably quenching its quiescent star formation. Hence morphology is
shown to be driven not only by mass but also by the nature of cosmic accretion:
at constant galaxy mass, ellipticals are galaxies that are mainly assembled
through mergers, while discs are preferentially built from the in situ star
formation fed by smooth cosmic gas infall.

characterize the hot gas component. Shock models are reasonably consistent with

disk with a resistive mid-plane that damps magnetohydrodynamic (MHD)
turbulence. This is an idealized model for the dead zones that may be present
at some radii in protoplanetary and dwarf novae disks. We vary the relative
thickness of the dead and active zones to quantify how forced fluid motions in
the dead zone change. We find that the residual Reynolds stress near the
mid-plane decreases with increasing dead zone thickness, becoming negligible in
cases where the active to dead mass ratio is less than a few percent. This
implies that purely Ohmic dead zones would be vulnerable to episodic accretion
outbursts via the mechanism of Martin & Lubow (2011). We show that even thick
dead zones support a large amount of kinetic energy, but this energy is largely
in fluid motions that are inefficient at angular momentum transport. Confirming
results from Oishi & Mac Low (2009), the perturbed velocity field in the dead
zone is dominated by an oscillatory, vertically extended circulation pattern
with a low frequency compared to the orbital frequency. This disturbance has
the properties predicted for the lowest order r mode in a hydrodynamic disk. We
suggest that in a global disk similar excitations would lead to propagating
waves, whose properties would vary with the thickness of the dead zone and the
nature of the perturbations (isothermal or adiabatic). Flows with similar
amplitudes would buckle settled particle layers and could reduce the efficiency

compactifications with respect to decay via a bubble of nothing. We show
examples where this kind of instability is not prohibited by the spin
structure, i.e., periodicity of fermions about the extra dimension. However,
such ""topologically unobstructed"" cases do exhibit an extra-dimensional analog
of the well-known Coleman-De Luccia suppression mechanism, which prohibits the
decay of supersymmetric vacua. We demonstrate this explicitly in a four
dimensional Abelian-Higgs toy model coupled to supergravity. The
compactification of this model to $M_3 \times S_1$ presents the possibility of
vacua with different windings for the scalar field. Away from the
supersymmetric limit, these states decay by the formation of a bubble of
nothing, dressed with an Abelian-Higgs vortex. We show how, as one approaches
the supersymmetric limit, the circumference of the topologically unobstructed
bubble becomes infinite, thereby preventing the realization of this decay. This
demonstrates the dynamical origin of the decay suppression, as opposed to the
more familiar argument based on the spin structure. We conjecture that this is
a generic mechanism that enforces stability of any topologically unobstructed
supersymmetric compactification.

on sparticle masses and the discovery potential of the model, both via
conventional sparticle searches and via searches for displaced vertices. The
strongest bound from searches for promptly decaying sparticles yields a lower
limit on the gluino mass of 1080 GeV. An analysis of 100 fb$^{-1}$ from Run II,
on the other hand, is expected to be sensitive up to 1900 GeV. The displaced
vertex searches from Run I suffer from a very low signal efficiency, mainly due
to the presence of $b-$quarks in the final state. We show how the displaced
vertex cuts might be relaxed in order to improve signal efficiency, while
simultaneous prompt objects can be used to cut down background. We find that a
combined search strategy with both prompt and displaced cuts potentially has a
far better sensitivity to this model than either set alone, motivating a fully

relation. This is done by presenting a toy model for the large-scale matter
distribution in a static Universe. Our model mainly concerns particles with
masses far below those in the Standard Model of Particle Physics. The model is
founded on three main assumptions: (1) a mass spectrum dN$_{\rm i}$/dm$_{\rm
i}$ $=$ $\beta$m$_{\rm i}^{-\alpha}$ (where $\alpha$ and $\beta$ are both
positive constants) for low-mass particles with m$_{\rm i}$ $\ll$ 10$^{-22}$ eV
$\ll$ M$_{\rm P}$, where M$_{\rm P}$ is the Planck mass; (2) a particle
mass-wavelength relation of the form $\lambda_{\rm i} =$ $\hbar$/$\delta_{\rm
i}$m$_{\rm i}$c, where $\delta_{\rm i} =$ $\eta$m$_{\rm i}^{\gamma}$ and $\eta$
and $\gamma$ are both constants; and (3) For such low-mass particles, locality
can only be defined on large spatial scales, comparable to or exceeding the
particle wavelengths.
  We use our model to derive the cosmological redshift characteristic of the
Standard Model of Cosmology, which becomes a gravitational redshift in our
model. We compare the results of our model to empirical data and show that, in
order to reproduce the sub-linear form of the observed distance-redshift
relation, our model requires $\alpha$ + $\gamma$ $<$ 0. We further place our
toy model in the context of the Friedmann Universe via a superposition of
Einstein Universes, each with its own scale factor a$_{\rm i}$. Given the
overwhelming evidence supporting an expanding Universe, we then address
possible modifications to our base model that would be required to account for
the available empirical constraints, including the addition of some initial
expansion. Finally, we consider potentially observable distinctions between the
cosmological redshift and our proposed mechanism to account for the observed
distance-redshift relation.

be very promising in order to investigate mass hierarchy. Illustration of
separation between two hierarchy ellipses in the E-L plane is very helping to
cover all the desired base lines and beam energies and also to analyze benefits
and drawbacks at single place. If we know the mass hierarchy, then from the
large sizes of CP trajectory ellipse which is possible at appropriately long
base line (L) and at specific value of beam energy (E), it becomes possible to
investigate at-least narrow ranges of CP/T-violating phase \delta^{CP}. The
Possibility of more than one set of (\theta_{13}; \delta^{CP}) parameters to
correspond to any chosen coordinate in P-P^T plane, known as parameter

dependence does not play a major role in determining the decay width, which can
be controlled only by the asymptotic strength of the pairing interaction. This
asymptotic pairing sensitivity can be understood in terms of the dynamics of

remains an impossible trinity problem: it cannot simultaneously reproduce the

importance of the linear redshift space distortions and gravitational lensing
corrections to the galaxy number density fluctuation. We show that redshift
space distortions significantly affect the shape of the correlation function,
both in radial and transverse directions, causing different values of galaxy
bias to induce offsets up to 1% in the AP test. On the other hand, we find that
the lensing correction around the BAO scale modifies the amplitude but not the
shape of the correlation function and therefore does not introduce any
systematic effect. Furthermore, we investigate in details how the AP test is
sensitive to redshift binning: a window function in transverse direction
suppresses correlations and shifts the peak position toward smaller angular
scales. We determine the correction that should be applied in order to account
for this effect, when performing the test with data from three future planned
galaxy redshift surveys: Euclid, the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument

molecular clouds forms stars, leading to the observed low star formation rate
(SFR). The same holds when averaged over many molecular clouds, such that the
SFR of whole galaxies is again surprisingly low. Indeed, considering the low
temperatures, molecular clouds should be highly gravitationally unstable and
collapse on their global mean freefall timescale. And yet, they are observed to
live about 10-100 times longer, i.e., the SFR per freefall time is only a few

global collapse. Magnetic fields, turbulence and stellar feedback have been
proposed as stabilising agents controlling star formation, but it is still
unclear which of these processes is the most important and what their relative

imaging missions where and when to observe, and the dynamically-determined
masses provide important constraints for the interpretation of planetary
spectra. Quantifying the set of planet masses and orbits that could have been
detected will enable more efficient planet discovery and characterization. We
analyzed Doppler measurements from Lick and Keck Observatories collected by the
California Planet Survey. We focused on stars that are likely targets for three
space-based planet imaging mission concepts studied by NASA--WFIRST-AFTA,
Exo-C, and Exo-S. The Doppler targets are primarily F8 and later main sequence
stars, with observations spanning 1987-2014. We identified 76 stars with
Doppler measurements from the prospective mission target lists. We developed an
automated planet search and a methodology to estimate the pipeline completeness
using injection and recovery tests. We applied this machinery to the Doppler
data and computed planet detection limits for each star as a function of planet
minimum mass and semi-major axis. For typical stars in the survey, we are
sensitive to approximately Saturn-mass planets inside of 1 AU, Jupiter-mass
planets inside of ~3 AU, and our sensitivity declines out to ~10 AU. For the
best Doppler targets, we are sensitive to Neptune-mass planets in 3 AU orbits.

cooperative inverse reinforcement learning (CIRL). A CIRL problem is a
cooperative, partial-information game with two agents, human and robot; both
are rewarded according to the human's reward function, but the robot does not

assumed to act optimally in isolation, optimal CIRL solutions produce behaviors
such as active teaching, active learning, and communicative actions that are
more effective in achieving value alignment. We show that computing optimal
joint policies in CIRL games can be reduced to solving a POMDP, prove that
optimality in isolation is suboptimal in CIRL, and derive an approximate CIRL
algorithm.

hadrons such as the deuteron, and they could probe new quark-gluon dynamics in
hadron and nuclear physics. In charged-lepton deep inelastic scattering (DIS),
they are studied by the twist-two structure functions $b_1$ and $b_2$. The
HERMES collaboration found unexpectedly large $b_1$ values than a naive
theoretical expectation based on the standard deuteron model. The situation
should be significantly improved in the near future by an approved experiment
to measure $b_1$ at JLab (Thomas Jefferson National Accelerator Facility).
There is also an interesting indication in the HERMES result that finite
antiquark tensor polarization exists. It could play an important role in
solving a mechanism on tensor structure in the quark-gluon level. The
tensor-polarized antiquark distributions are not easily determined from the
charged-lepton DIS; however, they can be measured in a proton-deuteron
Drell-Yan process with a tensor-polarized deuteron target. In this article, we
estimate the tensor-polarization asymmetry for a possible Fermilab
Main-Injector experiment by using optimum tensor-polarized PDFs to explain the
HERMES measurement. We find that the asymmetry is typically a few percent. If
it is measured, it could probe new hadron physics, and such studies could
create an interesting field of high-energy spin physics. In addition, we find
that a significant tensor-polarized gluon distribution should exist due to
$Q^2$ evolution, even if it were zero at a low $Q^2$ scale. The
tensor-polarized gluon distribution has never been observed, so that it is an
interesting future project.

running a more efficient Markov chain $\{ \hat{X}_{t} \}_{t \in \mathbb{N}}$ on

prove that for Markov chains on finite state spaces, the mixing time of any
lift of a Markov chain is at least the square root of the mixing time of the
original chain, up to a factor that depends on the stationary measure.
Unfortunately, this extra factor makes the bound in [CLP99] very loose for
Markov chains on large state spaces and useless for Markov chains on continuous
state spaces. In this paper, we develop an extension of the evolving set method
that allows us to refine this extra factor and find bounds for Markov chains on
continuous state spaces that are analogous to the bounds in [CLP99]. These
bounds also allow us to improve on the bounds in [CLP99] for some chains on

combined can store the entire content library among them). We demonstrate
approximate optimality with respect to information-theoretic bounds that do not

characterization reveals three key insights. First, the approximate DoF is
achieved using a strategy that separates the physical and network layers. This
separation architecture is thus approximately optimal. Second, we show that
increasing transmitter cache memory beyond what is needed to exactly store the
entire library between all transmitters does not provide more than a
constant-factor benefit to the DoF. A consequence is that transmit zero-forcing
is not needed for approximate optimality. Third, we derive an interesting
trade-off between the receiver memory and the number of transmitters needed for
approximately maximal performance. In particular, if each receiver can store a
constant fraction of the content library, then only a constant number of
transmitters are needed. Our solution to the caching problem requires
formulating and solving a new communication problem, the symmetric multiple
multicast X-channel, for which we provide an exact DoF characterization.

until a new protocol from the next measurement is applied. Unlike a feedback
process without delay, both memories associated with previous and present
measurement outcomes are involved in the system dynamics, which naturally
brings forth a joint system described by a system state and two memory states.
The thermodynamic second law provides a lower bound for heat flow into a
thermal reservoir by the (3-state) Shannon entropy change of the joint system.
However, as the feedback protocol depends on memory states sequentially, we can
deduce a tighter bound for heat flow by integrating out irrelevant memory
states during dynamics. As a simple example, we consider the so-called cold
damping feedback process where the velocity of a particle is measured and a
dissipative feedback protocol is applied to decelerate the particle. We confirm
that the heat flow is well above the tightest bound. We also examine the
long-time limit of this feedback process, which turns out to exhibit an
interesting instability transition as well as heating by controlling parameters
such as measurement errors, time interval, protocol strength, and time delay
length. We discuss the underlying mechanism for instability and heating, which
might be unavoidable in reality.

multi-labeling (Sup-ML and Sub-ML) problems, respectively, by re-writing the
objective functions as set functions. The convex relaxation on the Lov\'{a}sz

the MHV and the MUHV problems can also be approximated within $\frac{2}{k}$ and
$2 - \frac{2}{k}$, respectively, using the same approximation algorithms. For
MHV, this $\frac{2}{k}$-approximation algorithm improves the previous best
approximation ratio $\max \{\frac{1}{k}, \frac{1}{\Delta + 1}\}$, where
$\Delta$ is the maximum vertex degree of the input graph. We also show that an
existing LP relaxation is the same as the concave relaxation on the Lov\'{a}sz

on the integrality gap of the LP relaxation. These suggest that the
$\frac{2}{k}$-approximation algorithm is the best possible based on the LP

magnetic particle imaging (MPI) with a field-free-line (FFL) encoding scheme

(ML-EM) algorithm for improving the image quality of MPI. The feasibility of
these methods was investigated by computer simulations, in which the projection
data were generated by summing up the Fourier harmonics obtained from the MPI
signals based on the Langevin function. Images were reconstructed from the
generated projection data using the filtered backprojection (FBP) method and
the ML-EM algorithm. The effects of the gradient of selection magnetic field
(SMF), the strength of drive magnetic field (DMF), the diameter of magnetic
nanoparticles (MNPs), and the number of projection data on the image quality of
the reconstructed images were investigated. The spatial resolution of the
reconstructed images became better with increasing gradient of SMF and with
increasing diameter of MNPs up to approximately 30 nm. For the diameter greater
than approximately 30 nm, the spatial resolution was almost constant. It also
became better with decreasing strength of DMF. The image quality was improved
by use of the ML-EM algorithm compared to the FBP method, especially when the
strength of DMF was weak and the number of projection data was small. In
conclusion, we presented image reconstruction methods for MPI with an FFL
encoding scheme and our preliminary results suggest that the ML-EM algorithm
will be useful for improving the image quality of MPI.

However these important developments have seldom been utilized for network

aware that its message has been correctly sent over the channel then it becomes
immediately inactive. The measure to optimize is the number of time slots
needed to solve conflicts among all active stations. The fundamental question
is whether this measure decreases linearly with the number d of messages that
can be simultaneously transmitted with success. We give a positive answer to
this question by providing a conflict resolution algorithm that uses a 1/d
ratio of the number of time slots used by the optimal conflict resolution
algorithm for the case d=1. Moreover, we derive a lower bound on the number of
time slots needed to solve conflicts non-adaptively which is within a log (k/d)
factor from the upper bound. To this aim, we introduce a new combinatorial
structure that consists in a generalization of Komlos and Greenberg codes.
Constructions of these new codes are obtained via a new generalization of
selectors, whereas the non-existential result is implied by a non-existential
result for a new generalization of the locally thin families.

show the minimal number of agents which should have knowledge of a global

  and Two-Stage Group Testing",,,,,"cs.DS","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Group testing is a well known search problem that consists in detecting the
defective members of a set of objects O by performing tests on properly chosen
subsets (pools) of the given set O. In classical group testing the goal is to
find all defectives by using as few tests as possible. We consider a variant of
classical group testing in which one is concerned not only with minimizing the
total number of tests but aims also at reducing the number of tests involving
defective elements. The rationale behind this search model is that in many
practical applications the devices used for the tests are subject to
deterioration due to exposure to or interaction with the defective elements. In
this paper we consider adaptive, non-adaptive and two-stage group testing. For
all three considered scenarios, we derive upper and lower bounds on the number
of ""yes"" responses that must be admitted by any strategy performing at most a
certain number t of tests. In particular, for the adaptive case we provide an
algorithm that uses a number of ""yes"" responses that exceeds the given lower
bound by a small constant. Interestingly, this bound can be asymptotically
attained also by our two-stage algorithm, which is a phenomenon analogous to
the one occurring in classical group testing. For the non-adaptive scenario we
give almost matching upper and lower bounds on the number of ""yes"" responses.
In particular, we give two constructions both achieving the same asymptotic
bound. An interesting feature of one of these constructions is that it is an
explicit construction. The bounds for the non-adaptive and the two-stage cases
follow from the bounds on the optimal sizes of new variants of d-cover free
families and (p,d)-cover free families introduced in this paper, which we
believe may be of interest also in other contexts.

tensors. This versatile framework is guaranteed to estimate the correct model
consistently. My thesis spans both theoretical analysis of tensor decomposition
framework and practical implementation of various applications. This thesis
presents theoretical results on convergence to globally optimal solution of
tensor decomposition using the stochastic gradient descent, despite
non-convexity of the objective. This is the first work that gives global
convergence guarantees for the stochastic gradient descent on non-convex
functions with exponentially many local minima and saddle points. This thesis
also presents large-scale deployment of spectral methods carried out on various
platforms. Dimensionality reduction techniques such as random projection are
incorporated for a highly parallel and scalable tensor decomposition algorithm.
We obtain a gain in both accuracies and in running times by several orders of

of the magnetic field. However, recent simulations of collisionless shocks in
homogeneous plasmas show that the magnetic field generated by the Weibel
instability rapidly decays. There must be some density fluctuations in
interstellar and circumstellar media. The density fluctuations are
anisotropically compressed in the downstream region of relativistic shocks. In
this paper, we study the Weibel instability in electron--positron plasmas with
the spatially anisotropic density distributions by means of two-dimensional
particle-in-cell simulations. We find that large magnetic fields are maintained
for a longer time by the Weibel instability driven by the spatially anisotropic
density structure. Particles anisotropically escape from the high density
region, so that the temperature anisotropy is generated and the Weibel

density-intrinsic ellipticity (mI), galaxy density-intrinsic ellipticity (dI),
gravitational shear-intrinsic ellipticity (GI), and intrinsic
ellipticity-intrinsic ellipticity (II) correlations. We find stronger
correlations for more massive and more luminous galaxies, as well as for
earlier photometric types, in agreement with observations. Moreover, the
correlations significantly depend on the choice of shape estimator, even if
calibrated to serve as unbiased shear estimators. In particular, shape
estimators that down-weight the outer parts of galaxy images produce much
weaker IA signals on intermediate and large scales than methods employing flat
radial weights. The expected contribution of intrinsic alignments to the
observed ellipticity correlation in tomographic cosmic shear surveys may be
below one percent or several percent of the full signal depending on the
details of the shape measurement method. A comparison of our results to a tidal
alignment model indicates that such a model is able to reproduce the IA
correlations well on intermediate and large scales, provided the effect of
varying galaxy density is correctly taken into account. We also find that the

borderline between their ordered and disordered phases. Critical networks have
been argued to lead to a number of functional advantages such as maximal
dynamical range, maximal sensitivity to environmental changes, as well as to an
excellent trade off between stability and flexibility. Here, we study the
effect of noise within the context of Boolean networks trained to learn complex
tasks under supervision. We verify that quasi-critical networks are the ones
learning in the fastest possible way --even for asynchronous updating rules--
and that the larger the task complexity the smaller the distance to
criticality. On the other hand, when additional sources of intrinsic noise in
the network states and/or in its wiring pattern are introduced, the optimally
performing networks become clearly subcritical. These results suggest that in
order to compensate for inherent stochasticity, regulatory and other type of
biological networks might become subcritical rather than being critical, all
the most if the task to be performed has limited complexity.

to expect the bare chi_{c1}(2P) to be located above the D\bar D* threshold, but
relatively close to it, the presence of the charmonium state provides an
effective attraction that will contribute to bind the X(3872), but it will not
appear in the 2++ sector. Indeed in this latter sector, the chi_{c2}(2P) should
provide an effective small repulsion, because it is placed well below the
D*\bar D* threshold. We show how the 1++ and 2++ bare charmonium poles are
modified due to the D(*)\bar D(*) loop effects, and the first one is moved to
the complex plane. The meson loops produce, besides some shifts in the masses
of the charmonia, a finite width for the 1++ dressed charmonium state. On the
other hand, the X(3872) and X2(4012) start developing some charmonium content,
which is estimated by means of the compositeness Weinberg sum-rule. We also
show that for X(3872) molecular probabilities of around 70-90 %, the X2
resonance destabilizes and disappears from the spectrum, becoming either a
virtual state or being located deep into the complex plane, with decreasing
influence in the D* \bar D* scattering line.

dynamic adjustment of the high voltage is applied to keep gas gain constant.

velocity in the nodal direction is practically $\delta$-independent and its
universal value agrees very well with that determined experimentally. Also, a
weak doping dependence of the Fermi wave-vector leads to an almost constant
value of the effective mass in a pure superconducting phase which is both

application in recent years call for larger main memory. Traditional DRAM
memory can increase its capacity by reducing the feature size of storage cell.
Now further scaling of DRAM faces great challenge, and the frequent refresh
operations of DRAM can bring a lot of energy consumption. As an emerging
technology, Phase Change Memory (PCM) is promising to be used as main memory.
It draws wide attention due to the advantages of low power consumption, high
density and nonvolatility, while it incurs finite endurance and relatively long
write latency. To handle the problem of write, optimizing the cache replacement
policy to protect dirty cache block is an efficient way. In this paper, we
construct a systematically multilevel structure, and based on it propose a
novel cache replacement policy called MAC. MAC can effectively reduce write
traffic to PCM memory with low hardware overhead. We conduct simulation
experiments on GEM5 to evaluate the performances of MAC and other related
works. The results show that MAC performs best in reducing the amount of writes

perfectly models the aforementioned problem. Specifically, a dominating set $D$

to be severely limited in terms of geometric flexibility. Application of global
radial basis functions overcomes this, however at the expense of problematic
conditioning (1) in their most accurate flat basis function regime, and (2)
when problem sizes are scaled up to become of practical interest. The present
study considers a strategy to improve on these two issues by means of using
hybrid radial basis functions that combine cubic splines with Gaussian kernels.
The parameters, controlling Gaussian and cubic kernels in the hybrid RBF, are
selected using global particle swarm optimization. The proposed approach has
been tested with radial basis-pseudospectral method for numerical approximation
of Poisson, Helmholtz, and Transport equation. It was observed that the
proposed approach significantly reduces the ill-conditioning problem in the
RBF-PS method, at the same time, it preserves the stability and accuracy for
very small shape parameters. The eigenvalue spectra of the coefficient matrices
in the improved algorithm were found to be stable even at large degrees of
freedom, which mimic those obtained in pseudospectral approach. Also, numerical
experiments suggest that the hybrid kernel performs significantly better than
both pure Gaussian and pure cubic kernels.

the pursuit of higher performance in radio frequency electronics for both rigid

superior immunity to Short Channel Effects (SCEs) than bulk materials, they
could dominate in scaled GFETs. In this work, we have developed a model that
calculates electron and hole transport along the graphene channel in a
drift-diffusion basis, while considering the 2D electrostatics. Our model
obtains the self-consistent solution of the 2D Poisson's equation coupled to
the current continuity equation, the latter embedding an appropriate model for
drift velocity saturation. We have studied the role played by the
electrostatics and the velocity saturation in GFETs with short channel lengths
L. Severe scaling results in a high degradation of GFET output conductance. The
extrinsic cutoff frequency follows a 1/L^n scaling trend, where the index n
fulfills n < 2. The case n = 2 corresponds to long-channel GFETs with low
source/drain series resistance, that is, devices where the channel resistance
is controlling the drain current. For high series resistance, n decreases down
to n= 1, and it degrades to values of n < 1 because of the SCEs, especially at
high drain bias. The model predicts high maximum oscillation frequencies above
1 THz for channel lengths below 100 nm, but, in order to obtain these
frequencies, it is very important to minimize the gate series resistance. The
model shows very good agreement with experimental current voltage curves
obtained from short channel GFETs and also reproduces negative differential
resistance, which is due to a reduction of diffusion current.

the Planck era where quantum gravity settings are needed. The quantization of
the universe as a dynamical space-time is inspired by Loop Quantum Gravity
ideas. In addition, loop quantum cosmology could bridge contact with
astronomical observations, and thus potentially investigate quantum cosmology
modellings in the light of observations. To do so however, modelling both the
background evolution and its perturbations is needed. The latter describe
cosmic inhomogeneities that are the main cosmological observables. In this
context, we present the so-called deformed algebra approach implementing the
quantum corrections to the perturbed universe at an effective level by taking
great care of gauge issues. We particularly highlight that in this framework,
the algebra of hypersurface deformation receives quantum corrections, and we
discuss their meaning. The primordial power spectra of scalar and tensor
inhomogeneities are then presented, assuming initial conditions are set in the
contracting phase preceding the quantum bounce and the well-known expanding
phase of the cosmic history. These spectra are subsequently propagated to
angular power spectra of the anisotropies of the cosmic microwave background.
It is then shown that regardless of the choice for the initial conditions
inside the effective approach for the background evolution (except that they
are set in the contracting phase), the predicted angular power spectra of the
polarized B-modes exceed the upper bound currently set by observations. The
exclusion of this specific version of loop quantum cosmology establishes the
falsifiability of the approach, though one shall not conclude here that either
loop quantum cosmology or loop quantum gravity is excluded.

difficult to place an a priori upper bound on the number of components. To
circumvent this, investigators are turning increasingly to Dirichlet process
mixture models (DPMMs). It is therefore important to develop an understanding
of the strengths and weaknesses of this approach. This work considers the MAP
(maximum a posteriori) clustering for the Gaussian DPMM (where the cluster
means have Gaussian distribution and, for each cluster, the observations within
the cluster have Gaussian distribution). Some desirable properties of the MAP
partition are proved: `almost disjointness' of the convex hulls of clusters
(they may have at most one point in common) and (with natural assumptions) the
comparability of sizes of those clusters that intersect any fixed ball with the
number of observations (as the latter goes to infinity). Consequently, the
number of such clusters remains bounded. Furthermore, if the data arises from
independent identically distributed sampling from a given distribution with
bounded support then the asymptotic MAP partition of the observation space
maximises a function which has a straightforward expression, which depends only
on the within-group covariance parameter. As the operator norm of this
covariance parameter decreases, the number of clusters in the MAP partition
becomes arbitrarily large, which may lead to the overestimation of the number

find that a hydrogen number density of as high as $10^{10}~{\rm cm^{-3}}$,
instead of the typical density $10^5~{\rm cm^{-3}}$, is necessary for the
formation of mm-sized grains. Thus, we test a hypothesis that such large grains
are transported to the envelope from the inner, denser parts, finding that gas
drag by outflow efficiently ""launches"" the large grains as long as the central
object has not grown to $\gtrsim 0.1$ M$_{\odot}$. By investigating the
shattering effect on the mm-sized grains, we ensure that the large grains are
not significantly fragmented after being injected in the envelope. We conclude
that the mm-sized grains observed in the protostellar envelopes are not formed
in the envelopes but formed in the inner parts of the star-forming regions and
transported to the envelopes before a significant mass growth of the central
object, and that they survive in the envelopes.

from a large magnetic flux tube structure, consistent with the form of the
erupting filament system. Other CMEs arising from erupting filaments lack a
clear 3-part structure and reasons for this have not been researched in detail.
This paper aims to further establish the link between CME structure and the
structure of the erupting filament system and to investigate whether CMEs which
lack a 3-part structure have different eruption characteristics. A survey is
made of 221 near-limb filament eruptions observed from 2013/05/03-2014/06/30 by
EUV imagers and coronagraphs. 92 filament eruptions are associated with 3-part
structured CMEs, 41 eruptions are associated with unstructured CMEs. The
remaining 88 are categorized as failed eruptions. For 34% of the 3-part CMEs,
processing applied to EUV images reveals the erupting front edge is a
pre-existing loop structure surrounding the filament, which subsequently erupts
with the filament to form the leading bright front edge of the CME. This
connection is confirmed by a flux-rope density model. Furthermore, the
unstructured CMEs have a narrower distribution of mass compared to structured
CMEs, with total mass comparable to the mass of 3-part CME cores. This study
supports the interpretation of 3-part CME leading fronts as the outer
boundaries of a large pre-existing flux tube. Unstructured (non 3-part) CMEs
are a different family to structured CMEs, arising from the eruption of
filaments which are compact flux tubes in the absence of a large system of
enclosing closed field.

second-order derivatives in the equations of motion, thus evading Ostrogradsky
instabilities and making it of interest when modifying gravity at large scales.
To pass local tests of gravity, these modifications predominantly rely on
nonlinear screening mechanisms that recover Einstein's Theory of General
Relativity in regions of high density. We derive a set of conditions on the
four free functions of the Horndeski action that examine whether a specific
model embedded in the action possesses an Einstein gravity limit or not. For
this purpose, we develop a new and surprisingly simple scaling method that
identifies dominant terms in the equations of motion by considering formal
limits of the couplings that enter through the new terms in the modified
action. This enables us to find regimes where nonlinear terms dominate and
Einstein's field equations are recovered to leading order. Together with an
efficient approximation of the scalar field profile, one can then further
evaluate whether these limits can be attributed to a genuine screening effect.
For illustration, we apply the analysis to both a cubic galileon and a
chameleon model as well as to Brans-Dicke theory. Finally, we emphasise that
the scaling method also provides a natural approach for performing
post-Newtonian expansions in screened regimes.

localized operators are well defined in the conventional Fock space. By using
them we dig up the issues of localization in QFT showing how the globality of

the presence of CO, and the first observation of HCN, in Pluto's atmosphere.
The CO and HCN lines probe Pluto's atmosphere up to ~450 km and ~900 km
altitude, respectively. The CO detection yields (i) a much improved
determination of the CO mole fraction, as 515+/-40 ppm for a 12 ubar surface
pressure (ii) clear evidence for a well-marked temperature decrease (i.e.,
mesosphere) above the 30-50 km stratopause and a best-determined temperature of
70+/-2 K at 300 km, in agreement with recent inferences from New Horizons /
Alice solar occultation data. The HCN line shape implies a high abundance of
this species in the upper atmosphere, with a mole fraction >1.5x10-5 above 450
km and a value of 4x10-5 near 800 km. The large HCN abundance and the cold
upper atmosphere imply supersaturation of HCN to a degree (7-8 orders of
magnitude) hitherto unseen in planetary atmospheres, probably due to the slow
kinetics of condensation at the low pressure and temperature conditions of
Pluto's upper atmosphere. HCN is also present in the bottom ~100 km of the
atmosphere, with a 10-8 - 10-7 mole fraction; this implies either HCN
saturation or undersaturation there, depending on the precise stratopause
temperature. The HCN column is (1.6+/-0.4)x10^14 cm-2, suggesting a
surface-referred net production rate of ~2x10^7 cm-2s-1. Although HCN
rotational line cooling affects Pluto's atmosphere heat budget, the amounts
determined in this study are insufficient to explain the well-marked mesosphere
and upper atmosphere's ~70 K temperature. We finally report an upper limit on

spectral weight instead accumulates close to zero wavevector just above the
single-particle energy. On a technical level, we compare the numerical
efficiency of real-time evolution to an MPS-based Chebyshev expansion in the
present context, finding that both methods yield results of similar quality at
comparable numerical costs.

properties of the absorber recorded at the fifth observational epoch are
relatively well constrained by the presence of absorption in both the optical

by ionization changes in response to a variable incident continuum.
Photoionization simulations constrain the total hydrogen number density of the

re-organized in an insightful way by studying observables on the moduli space
of causal diamonds (or equivalently, the space of pairs of timelike separated
points). This 2d-dimensional space naturally captures some of the fundamental
nonlocality and causal structure inherent in the entanglement of CFT states.
For any primary CFT operator, we construct an observable on this space, which
is defined by smearing the associated one-point function over causal diamonds.
Known examples of such quantities are the entanglement entropy of vacuum
excitations and its higher spin generalizations. We show that in holographic
CFTs, these observables are given by suitably defined integrals of dual bulk
fields over the corresponding Ryu-Takayanagi minimal surfaces. Furthermore, we
explain connections to the operator product expansion and the first law of
entanglement entropy from this unifying point of view. We demonstrate that for
small perturbations of the vacuum, our observables obey linear two-derivative
equations of motion on the space of causal diamonds. In two dimensions, the
latter is given by a product of two copies of a two-dimensional de Sitter
space. For a class of universal states, we show that the entanglement entropy
and its spin-three generalization obey nonlinear equations of motion with local
interactions on this moduli space, which can be identified with Liouville and
Toda equations, respectively. This suggests the possibility of extending the
definition of our new observables beyond the linear level more generally and in
such a way that they give rise to new dynamically interacting theories on the
moduli space of causal diamonds. Various challenges one has to face in order to
implement this idea are discussed.

measured the Stark effect for donor electron spins in germanium. We resolved
both spin-orbit and hyperfine Stark shifts and found that at 0.4 T, the
spin-orbit Stark shift dominates. The spin-orbit Stark shift is highly
anisotropic, depending on the electric field orientation relative to the
crystal axes and external magnetic field. When the Stark shift is maximized,
the spin-orbit Stark parameter is four orders of magnitude larger than in
silicon. At select orientations a hyperfine Stark effect was also resolved and
is an order of magnitude larger than in silicon. We report the Stark parameters

By studying the state evolution of the fields produced by classical sources --
defined by a positive Glauber-Sudarshan P function -- when recording intensity
correlations of higher order in a generalized Hanbury Brown and Twiss setup we
find that the angular distribution of the last detected photon, apart from an
offset, is identical to the superradiant emission pattern generated by an
ensemble of two-level atoms in entangled symmetric Dicke states. We show that
the phenomenon derives from projective measurements induced by the measurement
of photons in the far field of the sources and the permutative superposition of
quantum paths identical to those leading to superradiance in the case of single
photon emitters. We thus point out an important similarity between classical
sources and quantum emitters upon detection of photons if the particular photon
source remains unknown. We finally present a compact result for the
characteristic functional which generates intensity correlations of arbitrary
order for any kind of light sources.

optimization algorithms, and have been successfully applied in various
real-world optimization tasks. However, previous theoretical studies often
employ EAs with only a parent or offspring population and focus on specific
problems. Furthermore, they often only show upper bounds on the running time,
while lower bounds are also necessary to get a complete understanding of an
algorithm. In this paper, we analyze the running time of the
($\mu$+$\lambda$)-EA (a general population-based EA with mutation only) on the
class of pseudo-Boolean functions with a unique global optimum. By applying the
recently proposed switch analysis approach, we prove the lower bound $\Omega(n
\ln n+ \mu + \lambda n\ln\ln n/ \ln n)$ for the first time. Particularly on the
two widely-studied problems, OneMax and LeadingOnes, the derived lower bound
discloses that the ($\mu$+$\lambda$)-EA will be strictly slower than the
(1+1)-EA when the population size $\mu$ or $\lambda$ is above a moderate order.
Our results imply that the increase of population size, while usually desired
in practice, bears the risk of increasing the lower bound of the running time
and thus should be carefully considered.

industrial instances. Most of the techniques have been developed after an
intensive experimental process. It is believed that these techniques exploit
the underlying structure of industrial instances. However, there are few works
trying to exactly characterize the main features of this structure.
  The research community on complex networks has developed techniques of
analysis and algorithms to study real-world graphs that can be used by the SAT
community. Recently, there have been some attempts to analyze the structure of
industrial SAT instances in terms of complex networks, with the aim of
explaining the success of SAT solving techniques, and possibly improving them.
  In this paper, inspired by the results on complex networks, we study the
community structure, or modularity, of industrial SAT instances. In a graph
with clear community structure, or high modularity, we can find a partition of
its nodes into communities such that most edges connect variables of the same
community. In our analysis, we represent SAT instances as graphs, and we show
that most application benchmarks are characterized by a high modularity. On the
contrary, random SAT instances are closer to the classical Erd\""os-R\'enyi
random graph model, where no structure can be observed. We also analyze how
this structure evolves by the effects of the execution of a CDCL SAT solver. In
particular, we use the community structure to detect that new clauses learned
by the solver during the search contribute to destroy the original structure of
the formula. This is, learned clauses tend to contain variables of distinct
communities.

the band structure of both monolayer and bilayer MoTe2 with DFT-GW

study the optical properties by means of photoluminescence (PL) excitation,
time-resolved PL and power dependent PL spectroscopy. We identify the same
energy for the B exciton state in monolayer and bilayer. Following circularly
polarized excitation, we do not find any exciton polarization for a large range
of excitation energies. At low temperature (T=10 K), we measure similar PL
decay times of the order of 4 ps for both monolayer and bilayer excitons with a
slightly longer one for the bilayer. Finally, we observe a reduction of the

a quantum theory different from that of NHEK. We obtain this quantum theory by

enables us to introduce a finite regulator on the $AdS_2$ boundary and compute
the full asymptotic symmetry group of the two-dimensional quantum conformal

Virasoro eigenmode. The central charge and lowest eigenmode produce the

asymptotic law, $\rho_{\pi}=\rho_0A^{1/3}$. The departure exhibits systematic
trends fairly well described by a single phenomenological term in the
Duflo-Zuker formulation, which also happens to explain the sudden increase in
slope in the isotope shifts of several chains at neutron number $N=28$. It was
recently shown that this term is associated with the abnormally large size of
the $s_{1/2}$ and $p$ orbits in the $sd$ and $pf$ shells respectively. Further
to explore the problem, we propose to calculate microscopically radii in the
former. Since the (square) radius is basically a one body operator, its
evolution is dictated by single particle occupancies determined by shell model
calculations. Assuming that the departure from the asymptotic form is entirely
due to the $s_{1/2}$ orbit, the expectation value $\langle
s_{1/2}|r^2|s_{1/2}\rangle$ is determined by demanding that its evolution be
such as to describe well nuclear radii. It does, for an orbit that remains very
large (about 1.6 fm bigger than its $d$ counterparts) up to $N,\,Z=14$ then
drops abruptly but remains some 0.6 fm larger than the $d$ orbits. An
unexpected behavior bound to challenge our understanding of shell formation.

(+) and enmity (-) between individuals. Group of individuals who are cyclically
connected are said to be balanced if the number of negative edges in the cycle
is even and unbalanced otherwise. In its earliest and most natural formulation,
the balance of a social network was thus defined from its simple cycles, cycles
which do not visit any vertex more than once. Because of the inherent
difficulty associated with finding such cycles on very large networks, social
balance has since then been studied via other means. In this article we present
the balance as measured from the simple cycles and primitive orbits of social
networks. We specifically provide two measures of balance: the proportion
$R_\ell$ of negative simple cycles of length $\ell$ for each $\ell\leq 20$
which generalises the triangle index, and a ratio $K_\ell$ which extends the
relative signed clustering coefficient introduced by Kunegis. To do so, we use
a Monte Carlo implementation of a novel exact formula for counting the simple
cycles on any weighted directed graph. Our method is free from the
double-counting problem affecting previous cycle-based approaches, does not
require edge-reciprocity of the underlying network, provides a gray-scale
measure of balance for each cycle length separately and is sufficiently
tractable that it can be implemented on a standard desktop computer. We observe
that social networks exhibit strong inter-edge correlations favouring balanced
situations and we determine the corresponding correlation length $\xi$. For
longer simple cycles, $R_\ell$ undergoes a sharp transition to values expected
from an uncorrelated model. This transition is absent from synthetic random
networks, strongly suggesting that it carries a sociological meaning warranting
further research.

quantum mechanics including the super position of states, the non locality and
its limitation to determine an experiment only statistically. Here, this well
known paradox is revisited theoretically for a pair of spin 1/2 systems in a
singlet state under the assumption that in classical physics time evolves in
discrete time steps Deltat while in quantum mechanics the individual spin
system(s) evolve(s) between the eigenstates harmonically with a period of 4
Deltat. It is further assumed that time is a single variable, that the quantum
mechanics time evolution and the classical physics discrete time evolution are
coherent to each other, and that the precision of the start of the experiment
and of the measurement time point are much less than Deltat. Under these
conditions, it is demonstrated for a spin 1/2 system that the fast oscillation
between the eigen states spin up and spin down reproduces the expected outcome
of a single measurement as well as ensemble measurements without the need of
postulating a simultaneous superposition of the spin system in its quantum
state. When this concept is applied to a spin 1/2 system pair in a singlet
state it is shown that no entanglement between the two spins is necessary to
describe the system resolving the Einstein-Podolski-Rosen paradox.

method to solve a class of nonconvex optimization problems involving low-rank
matrix variables. As opposed to the standard GN method, our algorithm allows
one to handle general smooth convex objective function. We show, under mild
conditions, that the proposed algorithm globally and locally converges to a
stationary point of the original problem. We also show empirically that the GN
algorithm achieves higher accurate solutions than the alternating minimization
algorithm (AMA). Then, we specify our GN scheme to handle the symmetric case
and prove its convergence, where AMA is not applicable. Next, we incorporate
our GN scheme into the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) to
develop an ADMM-GN algorithm. We prove that, under mild conditions and a proper
choice of the penalty parameter, our ADMM-GN globally converges to a stationary
point of the original problem. Finally, we provide several numerical
experiments to illustrate the proposed algorithms. Our results show that the
new algorithms have encouraging performance compared to existing methods.

systems $(X,\mathcal E,\mathsf d)$ driven by a time dependent energy $\mathcal
E$ and a dissipation quasi-distance $\mathsf d$ in a general metric-topological
space $X$. As for the classic Energetic approach, solutions can be obtained by
solving a modified time Incremental Minimization Scheme, where at each step the
dissipation (quasi-)distance $\mathsf d$ is incremented by a viscous correction
$\delta$ (e.g.~proportional to the square of the distance $\mathsf d$), which
penalizes far distance jumps by inducing a localized version of the stability
condition.
  We prove a general convergence result and a typical characterization by
Stability and Energy Balance in a setting comparable to the standard energetic
one, thus capable to cover a wide range of applications. The new refined Energy
Balance condition compensates the localized stability and provides a careful
description of the jump behavior: at every jump the solution follows an optimal
transition, which resembles in a suitable variational sense the discrete scheme
that has been implemented for the whole construction.

in the relativistic regime that the observed widths of radio lobes may be
explained if they are driven by very light jets. The ratio of energy stored in
the radio lobes to that put into the intracluster gas is seen to be the same

amplification by up to a factor of two in energy, but mostly the magnetic

our earlier result that for jets with a toroidally injected magnetic field, the
field in the lobes is predominantly aligned with the jet axis once the lobes

layer above an impedance wall is investigated numerically and asymptotically by
solving the compressible linearised Navier-Stokes equations. It is found that
viscothermal effects can be as important as shear, and therefore including
shear while neglecting viscothermal effects by solving the linearised Euler
equations is questionable. In particular, the damping rate of upstream
propagating waves is found to be dramatically under-predicted by the LEE in
certain instances. The effects of viscosity on stability are also found to be
important. Short wavelength disturbances are stabilised by viscosity, greatly
altering the characteristic wavelength and maximum growth rate of instability.
For the parameters typical of aeroacoustic simulations considered here, the
Reynolds number below which the flow stabilizes ranges from $10^5$ to $10^7$.
By assuming a thin but nonzero-thickness boundary layer, asymptotic analysis
leads to a system of boundary layer governing equations for the acoustics. This
system may be solved numerically to produce an effective impedance boundary
condition, applicable at the wall of a uniform inviscid flow, that accounts for
both the shear and viscosity within the boundary layer. An alternative
asymptotic analysis in the high frequency limit yields a different set of
equations with analytic solutions. The acoustic mode shapes and axial
wavenumbers from both asymptotic analyses compare well with numerical solutions
of the full LNSE. A closed-form effective impedance boundary condition is
derived from the high-frequency asymptotics, suitable for application in
frequency-domain numerical simulations. Finally, surface waves are considered,
and it is shown that a viscous flow over an impedance lining supports a greater
number of surface wave modes than an inviscid flow.

(GAS) to the problem of Pan-STARRS1 (PS1) astrometry. Current PS1 astrometry is
based on differential astrometric measurements using 2MASS reference stars,
thus PS1 astrometry inherits the errors of the 2MASS catalog. The GAS, based on
a single, least squares adjustment to approximately 750k grid stars using over
3000 extragalactic objects as reference objects, avoids this catalog-to-catalog
propagation of errors to a great extent. The GAS uses a relatively small number
of Quasi-Stellar Objects (QSOs, or distant AGN) with very accurate (<1 mas)
radio positions, referenced to the ICRF2. These QSOs provide a hard constraint
in the global least squares adjustment. Solving such a system provides absolute
astrometry for all the stars simultaneously. The concept is much cleaner than
conventional astrometry but is not easy to perform for large catalogs. In this
paper we describe our method and its application to Pan-STARRS1 data. We show
that large-scale systematic errors are easily corrected but our solution
residuals for position (~60 mas) are still larger than expected based on
simulations (~10 mas). We provide a likely explanation for the reason the
small-scale residual errors are not corrected in our solution as would be
expected.

Plate Chamber, RPC, starting from the basic physics of this detector. The
effect of different working parameters determining the rate capability is
analysed in detail, in order to optimize a new family of RPCs for applications
to heavy irradiation environments and in particular to the LHC phase 2. A
special emphasis is given to the improvement achievable by minimizing the
avalanche charge delivered in the gas. The paper shows experimental results of
Cosmic Ray tests, performed to study the avalanche features for different gas
gap sizes, with particular attention to the overall delivered charge. For this
purpose, the paper studies, in parallel to the prompt electronic signal, also
the ionic signal which gives the main contribution to the delivered charge.
Whenever possible the test results are interpreted on the base of the RPC
detector physics and are intended to extend and reinforce our physical
understanding of this detector.

with $T_{0}$-separation axiom using the loop space of time series data. In our
approach we define a cyclic coordinate of intrinsic time scale of time series
data after empirical mode decomposition. A spinor field of time series data
comes from the rotation of data around price and time axis by defining a new
extradimension to time series data. We show that there exist hidden eight
dimensions in Kolmogorov space for time series data. Our concept is realized as
the algorithm of empirical mode decomposition and intrinsic time scale
decomposition and it is subsequently used for preliminary analysis on the real
time series data.

dependence of the speed of electromagnetic radiation with the motion of its
source. This dependence is different from that predicted from emission theories
that long ago have been demonstrated to be wrong. By relating the velocity of
light and the corresponding Doppler effect with the velocity of the source at
the time of detection, instead of the time of emission, it is possible to
explain quantitatively and qualitatively the spacecraft anomalies. Also, a
formulation of electromagnetism compatible with this conception is possible
(and also compatible with the known electromagnetic phenomena). Under this
theory the influence of the velocity of the source in the speed of light is
somewhat subtle in many practical situations and probably went unnoticed in
other phenomena.

  case and the example about the 'exotic' Hopf module works only in the

$A$-module, $H$ a Hopf $\mathbb{K}$-algebra, $\delta:A\to H\otimes
A:=H\otimes_{\mathbb{K}} A$ an algebra coaction, and let $(H\otimes A)_\delta$
denote $H\otimes A$ with the right $A$-module structure induced by~$\delta$.
The usual definitions of an equivariant vector bundle naturally lead, in the
context of $\mathbb{K}$-algebras, to an $(H\otimes A)$-module homomorphism
\[\Theta:H\otimes M\to (H\otimes A)_\delta\otimes_AM\] that fulfills some
appropriate conditions. On the other hand, sometimes an $(A,H)$-Hopf module is
considered instead, for the same purpose. When $\Theta$ is invertible, as is
always the case when $H$ is commutative, the two descriptions are equivalent.
We point out that the two notions differ in general, by giving an example of a
noncommutative Hopf algebra $H$ for which there exists such a $\Theta$ that is
not invertible and a left-right $(A,H)$-Hopf module whose corresponding
homomorphism $M\otimes H\to (A\otimes H)_\delta\otimes_AM$ is not an
isomorphism.
