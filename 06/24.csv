selection of the tuning parameter; however, there is no commonly agreed-upon
criterion for choosing the tuning parameter. Moreover, penalized likelihood
estimation based on a single value of the tuning parameter suffers from several
drawbacks. This article introduces a novel approach for feature selection based
on the entire solution paths rather than the choice of a single tuning
parameter, which significantly improves the accuracy of the selection.
Moreover, the approach allows for feature selection using ridge or other
strictly convex penalties. The key idea is to classify variables as relevant or
irrelevant at each tuning parameter and then to select all of the variables
which have been classified as relevant at least once. We establish the
theoretical properties of the method, which requires significantly weaker
conditions than existing methods in the literature. We also illustrate the
advantages of the proposed approach with simulation studies and a data example.

survey several emerging LPWA technologies and the standardization activities
carried out by different standards development organizations (e.g., IEEE, IETF,

during AF has been poorly investigated: in particular, it is unknown how AF
influences hemodynamic parameters of the distal cerebral circulation, at the
arteriolar and capillary level. Two coupled lumped-parameter models (systemic
and cerebrovascular circulations, respectively) were here used to simulate
sinus rhythm (SR) and AF. For each simulation 5000 cardiac cycles were analyzed
and cerebral hemodynamic parameters were calculated. With respect to SR, AF
triggered a higher variability of the cerebral hemodynamic variables which
increases proceeding towards the distal circulation, reaching the maximum
extent at the arteriolar and capillary levels. This variability led to critical
cerebral hemodynamic events of excessive pressure or reduced blood flow: 303
hypoperfusions occurred at the arteriolar level, while 387 hypertensive events
occurred at the capillary level during AF. By contrast, neither hypoperfusions
nor hypertensive events occurred during SR. Thus, the impact of AF per se on
cerebral hemodynamics candidates as a relevant mechanism into the genesis of
AF-related cognitive impairment/dementia.

transport dynamo (FTD) model of the solar cycle based on the Babcock-Leighton
mechanism of poloidal magnetic field regeneration via the surface decay of
bipolar magnetic regions (BMRs). This hybrid model is constructed by allowing
the surface flux transport (SFT) simulation described in Lemerle et al. 2015 to
provide the poloidal source term to an axisymmetric FTD simulation defined in a
meridional plane, which in turn generates the BMRs required by the SFT. A key
aspect of this coupling is the definition of an emergence function describing
the probability of BMR emergence as a function of the spatial distribution of
the internal axisymmetric magnetic field. We use a genetic algorithm to
calibrate this function, together with other model parameters, against observed
cycle 21 emergence data. We present a reference dynamo solution reproducing
many solar cycle characteristics, including good hemispheric coupling, phase
relationship between the surface dipole and the BMR-generating internal field,
and correlation between dipole strength at cycle maximum and peak amplitude of
the next cycle. The saturation of the cycle amplitude takes place through the
quenching of the BMR tilt as a function of the internal field. The observed
statistical scatter about the mean BMR tilt, built into the model, acts as a
source of stochasticity which dominates amplitude fluctuations. The model thus
can produce Dalton-like epochs of strongly suppressed cycle amplitude lasting a
few cycles and can even shut off entirely following an unfavorable sequence of
emergence events.

diffusion of signals across biological, social and engineered networks. Within
these established frameworks, the inverse problem of identifying the source of
the propagated signal is challenging, owing to the numerous alternative
possibilities for signal progression through the network. In real world
networks, the challenge of determining sources is compounded as the true
propagation dynamics are typically unknown, and when they have been directly
measured, they rarely conform to the assumptions of any of the well-studied
models. In this paper we introduce a method called Network Infusion (NI) that
has been designed to circumvent these issues, making source inference practical
for large, complex real world networks. The key idea is that to infer the
source node in the network, full characterization of diffusion dynamics, in
many cases, may not be necessary. This objective is achieved by creating a
diffusion kernel that well-approximates standard diffusion models, but lends
itself to inversion, by design, via likelihood maximization or error
minimization. We apply NI for both single-source and multi-source diffusion,
for both single-snapshot and multi-snapshot observations, and for both
homogeneous and heterogeneous diffusion setups. We prove the mean-field
optimality of NI for different scenarios, and demonstrate its effectiveness
over several synthetic networks. Moreover, we apply NI to a real-data
application, identifying news sources in the Digg social network, and
demonstrate the effectiveness of NI compared to existing methods. Finally, we
propose an integrative source inference framework that combines NI with a
distance centrality-based method, which leads to a robust performance in cases

least-squares with parameter constraints (VPFIT); and Bayesian Model Averaging
(BMA).
  The method has broad application but here we apply it specifically to the
problem of measuring the fine structure constant at high redshift. For this we
need objectivity and reproducibility. GVPFIT is also motivated by the
importance of obtaining a large statistical sample of measurements of
$\Delta\alpha/\alpha$. Interactive analyses are both time consuming and complex
and automation makes obtaining a large sample feasible.
  In contrast to previous methodologies, we use BMA to derive results using a
large set of models and show that this procedure is more robust than a human
picking a single preferred model since BMA avoids the systematic uncertainties
associated with model choice.
  Numerical simulations provide stringent tests of the whole process and we
show using both real and simulated spectra that the unified automated fitting
procedure out-performs a human interactive analysis. The method should be
invaluable in the context of future instrumentation like ESPRESSO on the VLT
and indeed future ELTs.

resources. These decisions typically involve a tension between increasing the
total level of group resources (i.e. social efficiency) and distributing these
resources among group members (i.e. individuals' relative shares). This is the
case because the redistribution process may destroy part of the resources, thus
resulting in socially inefficient allocations. Here we apply a dual-process
approach to understand the cognitive underpinnings of this fundamental tension.
We conducted a set of experiments to examine the extent to which different
allocation decisions respond to intuition or deliberation. In a newly developed
approach, we assess intuition and deliberation at both the trait level (using
the Cognitive Reflection Test, henceforth CRT) and the state level (through the
experimental manipulation of response times). To test for robustness,
experiments were conducted in two countries: the US and India. Despite absolute
level differences across countries, in both locations we show that: (i) time
pressure and low CRT scores are associated with individuals' concerns for their
relative shares; (ii) time delay and high CRT scores are associated with
individuals' concerns for social efficiency. These findings demonstrate that
deliberation favours social efficiency by overriding individuals' intuitive
tendency to focus on relative shares.

their surfaces. However, in most symbiotics, the origin of this burning is
unclear. In symbiotic slow novae, however, it is linked to a past thermonuclear
runaway. In June 2015, the symbiotic slow nova AG Peg was seen in only its
second optical outburst since 1850. This recent outburst was of much shorter
duration and lower amplitude than the earlier eruption, and it contained
multiple peaks -- like outbursts in classical symbiotic stars such as Z And. We
report Swift X-ray and UV observations of AG Peg made between June 2015 and
January 2016. The X-ray flux was markedly variable on a time scale of days,
particularly during four days near optical maximum, when the X-rays became
bright and soft. This strong X-ray variability continued for another month,
after which the X-rays hardened as the optical flux declined. The UV flux was
high throughout the outburst, consistent with quasi-steady shell burning on the
white dwarf. Given that accretion disks around white dwarfs with shell burning
do not generally produce detectable X-rays (due to Compton-cooling of the
boundary layer), the X-rays probably originated via shocks in the ejecta. As
the X-ray photo-electric absorption did not vary significantly, the X-ray
variability may directly link to the properties of the shocked material. AG
Peg's transition from a slow symbiotic nova (which drove the 1850 outburst) to
a classical symbiotic star suggests that shell burning in at least some
symbiotic stars is residual burning from prior novae.

of single neurons, with particular relevance of the spike-generation mechanism.
The latter hinges upon the bifurcation type at the transition point between
resting state and limit cycle spiking. Prominent qualitative changes in
encoding have previously been attributed to a specific switch of such a
bifurcation at the Bogdanov-Takens (BT) point. This study unveils another,
highly relevant and so far underestimated transition point: the saddle-node
loop bifurcation. As we show, this bifurcation turns out to induce even more
drastic changes in spike-based coding than the BT transition. This result
arises from a direct effect of the saddle-node loop bifurcation on the limit
cycle and hence spike dynamics, in contrast to the BT bifurcation, whose
immediate influence is exerted upon the subthreshold dynamics and hence only
indirectly relates to spiking. We specifically demonstrate that the saddle-node
loop bifurcation (i) ubiquitously occurs in planar neuron models with a
saddle-node on invariant cycle onset bifurcation, and (ii) results in a
symmetry breaking of the system's phase-response curve. The latter entails
close to optimal coding and synchronization properties in event-based
information processing units, such as neurons. The saddle-node loop bifurcation
leads to a peak in synchronization range and provides an attractive mechanism
for the so far unresolved facilitation of high frequencies in neuronal
processing. The derived bifurcation structure is of interest in any system for
which a relaxation limit is admissible, such as Josephson junctions and
chemical oscillators. On the experimental side, our theory applies to optical
stimulation of nerve cells, and reveals that these techniques could manipulate
a variety of information processing characteristics in nerve cells beyond pure
activation.

indirect measurements often requires solving ill-posed inverse problems. These
so called parameter estimation or inverse medium problems arise in a variety of
applications such as geophysical, medical imaging, and nondestructive testing.
Their solution is computationally intense since the underlying PDEs need to be
solved numerous times until the reconstruction of the parameters is
sufficiently accurate. Typically, the computational demand grows significantly
when more measurements are available, which poses severe challenges to
inversion algorithms as measurement devices become more powerful.
  In this paper we present jInv, a flexible framework and open source software
that provides parallel algorithms for solving parameter estimation problems
with many measurements. Being written in the expressive programming language
Julia, jInv is portable, easy to understand and extend, cross-platform tested,
and well-documented. It provides novel parallelization schemes that exploit the
inherent structure of many parameter estimation problems and can be used to
solve multiphysics inversion problems as is demonstrated using numerical
experiments motivated by geophysical imaging.

three different ways to classify our galaxies. We find that the fraction of
galaxies selected as 2-component galaxies increases on average 50 per cent from
the lowest mass bin to the most massive galaxies, and decreases with redshift
by a factor of four from z = 1 to z = 3. We find that single S\'ersic
'disc-like' galaxies have the highest relative number densities at all
redshifts, and that 2-component galaxies have the greatest increase and become
at par with S\'ersic discs by z = 1. We also find that the systems we classify
as 2-component galaxies have an increase in the sizes of their outer
components, or 'discs', by about a factor of three from z = 3 to z = 1.5, while
the inner components or 'bulges' stay roughly the same size. This suggests that
these systems are growing from the inside out, whilst the bulges or protobulges

lesser degree in the growth of single 'disc-like' galaxies vs. 'spheroid-like'

spherical coordinates is extended to evaluate the acoustic radiation force
experienced by rigid oblate and prolate spheroids centered on the axis of wave
propagation of high-order Bessel vortex beams composed of progressive, standing
and quasi-standing waves, respectively. A coupled system of linear equations is
derived after applying the Neumann boundary condition for an immovable surface
in a non-viscous fluid, and solved numerically by matrix inversion after
performing a single numerical integration procedure. The system of linear
equations depends on the partial-wave index n and the order of the Bessel
vortex beam m using truncated but converging PWSEs in the least-squares sense.
Numerical results for the radiation force function, which is the radiation
force per unit energy density and unit cross-sectional surface, are computed
with particular emphasis on the amplitude ratio describing the transition from
the progressive to the pure standing waves cases, the aspect ratio (i.e., the
ratio of the major axis over the minor axis of the spheroid), the half-cone
angle and order of the Bessel vortex beam, as well as the dimensionless size
parameter. A generalized expression for the radiation force function is derived
for cases encompassing the progressive, standing and quasi-standing waves of
Bessel vortex beams. This expression can be reduced to other types of
beams/waves such as the zeroth-order Bessel non-vortex beam or the infinite
plane wave case by appropriate selection of the beam parameters. The results
for progressive waves reveal a tractor beam behavior, characterized by the
emergence of an attractive pulling force acting in opposite direction of wave
propagation. Moreover, the transition to the quasi-standing and pure standing
wave cases shows the acoustical tweezers behavior in dual-beam Bessel vortex

following long-standing question: can the length spectrum of a closed
Riemannian manifold be recovered from its Laplace spectrum? The Poisson
relation states that for any closed Riemannian manifold $(M,g)$ the singular
support of the trace of its wave group---a spectrally determined tempered
distribution---is contained in the set consisting of $\pm \tau$, where $\tau$
is the length of a smoothly closed geodesic in $(M,g)$. Therefore, in cases
where the Poisson relation is an equality, we obtain a method for retrieving
the length spectrum of a manifold from its Laplace spectrum. The Poisson
relation is known to be an equality for sufficiently ""bumpy"" Riemannian
manifolds and there are no known counterexamples.
  We demonstrate that the Poisson relation is an equality for a compact Lie
group equipped with a generic bi-invariant metric. Consequently, the length
spectrum of a generic bi-invariant metric (and the rank of its underlying Lie
group) can be recovered from its Laplace spectrum. Furthermore, we exhibit a
substantial collection $\mathscr{G}$ of compact Lie groups---including those
that are either tori, simple, simply-connected, or products thereof---with the
property that for each group $U \in \mathscr{G}$ the Laplace spectrum of any
bi-invariant metric $g$ carried by $U$ encodes the length spectrum of $g$ and
the rank of $U$. The preceding statements are special cases of results
concerning compact globally symmetric spaces for which the semi-simple part of
the universal cover is split-rank. The manifolds considered herein join a short

Abell 3667 are presented. A shock is detected at the sharp outer edge of the
radio relic, both in the X-ray surface brightness and the temperature profiles.
The Mach number is M = 2.54^+0.80_-0.43. The temperature jump at the shock is
larger than expected from the density jump, which may indicate that a
dynamically important magnetic field aligned primarily parallel to the shock
front is present. The gas temperature rises gradually over several arc minutes
within the shock region. This could indicate that the shock energy is initially
dissipated into some mix of thermal and nonthermal (e.g., turbulence)
components, and that the nonthermal energy decays into heat in the post-shock
region. The observed radio relic can be powered if ~0.2% of the energy
dissipated in the shock goes into the (re)acceleration of relativistic
electrons. We show that the observed steepening of the radio spectrum with
distance behind the shock is consistent with radiative losses by the
radio-emitting electrons. However, the radio spectrum immediately behind the
shock is flatter than expected for linear diffusive shock acceleration of
thermal electrons. This suggests that the shock re-accelerates a pre-existing
population of relativistic electrons. We also detect a bright, cool region (the
""Mushroom"") to the south of the radio relic, which we propose is the remnant
cool core of a merging subcluster, and that this subcluster was the driver for
the observed NW shock. In this model, the properties of Abell 3667 are mainly
the result of an offset binary merger, and the cluster is being observed about
1 Gyr after first core passage. We predict that deeper X-ray or SZ observations
of the SE radio relic will reveal a second merger shock at the outer edge.

This method infers the redshift distribution based on the spatial clustering of

Applying this method to the existing SDSS photometric galaxies, and projecting
to future radio continuum surveys, we show that sources can be efficiently
divided into several redshift bins, increasing their ability to constrain
cosmological parameters. We forecast constraints on the dark-energy
equation-of-state and on local non-gaussianity parameters. We explore several
pertinent issues, including the tradeoff between including more sources versus
minimizing the overlap between bins, the shot-noise limitations on binning, and
the predicted performance of the method at high redshifts. Remarkably, we find
that, once this technique is implemented, constraints on dynamical dark energy
from the SDSS imaging catalog can be competitive with, or better than, those
from the spectroscopic BOSS survey and even future planned experiments.
Further, constraints on primordial non-Gaussianity from future large-sky
radio-continuum surveys can outperform those from the Planck CMB experiment,
and rival those from future spectroscopic galaxy surveys. The application of
this method thus holds tremendous promise for cosmology.

0.5 < z < 3 for SFRs averaged over 100 Myr. The scatter increases modestly at z

merger-induced star formation is generally small, around 5% today and 10 - 15%

be contrasted with massive-stellar-binary, globular-cluster, or other

very effectively circularized by the time the BBH enters the observable LIGO

based on cross correlating a weak lensing ($\kappa$) map with a predicted map
constructed from a redshift survey. Moderately deep and high resolution images
with Subaru/Hyper Suprime-Cam covering the 4 deg^2 DLS F2 field provide a
$\kappa$ map with 1 arcmin resolution. A dense complete redshift survey of the
F2 field including 12,705 galaxies with $R\leq20.6$ is the basis for
construction of the predicted map. The zero-lag cross-correlation between the
\kappa and predicted maps is significant at the $30\sigma$ level. The width of
the cross-correlation peak is comparable with the angular scale of rich cluster
at $z\sim0.3$, the median depth of the redshift survey. Slices of the predicted
map in $\delta{z} = 0.05$ redshift bins enable exploration of the impact of
structure as a function of redshift. The zero-lag normalised cross-correlation
has significant local maxima at redshifts coinciding with known massive X-ray
clusters. Even in slices where there are no known massive clusters, there is
significant signal in the cross-correlation originating from lower mass groups
that trace the large-scale of the universe. Spectroscopic $D_n4000$
measurements enable division of the sample into star-forming and quiescent
populations. The significance of the cross-correlation with structure
containing star-forming galaxies increases with redshift from $5\sigma$ at $z =
0.3$ to $7 \sigma$ at $z = 0.5$. The weak lensing results are consistent with
the downsizing view of galaxy evolution established on the basis of many other
independent studies.

generally more challenging for scenarios involving non-minimal dark sectors
such as Dynamical Dark Matter (DDM) than for scenarios involving a single dark
particle. This additional difficulty arises because the partitioning of the
total dark-matter abundance across an ensemble of different constituent
particles with different masses tends to ""smear"" the injection spectra of
photons and other cosmic-ray particles that are produced via dark-matter
annihilation or decay. As a result, the imprints of the dark sector on these
cosmic-ray flux spectra typically take the form of continuum features rather
than sharp peaks or lines. In this paper, however, we identify an unambiguous
signature of non-minimal dark sectors such as DDM which can overcome these
issues and potentially be observed at gamma-ray telescopes operating in the MeV
range. We discuss the specific situations in which this signature can arise,
and demonstrate that this signature can be exploited in order to significantly
enhance our ability to resolve the unique spectral features of DDM and other
non-minimal dark sectors at future gamma-ray facilities.

match the typical size of observed fields at $z=3.1$ ($\sim 1 {\rm deg^2}$). In
our model a dark matter halo with mass in the range $M_{\rm min}<M_{\mathrm

the parameter space determined by $M_{\rm min}$,$M_{\rm max}$ and $f_{\rm occ}$

occupation fraction $0.02\leq f_{\rm occ} \leq 0.30$. As a consequence the
median mass, $M_{50}$, of all the consistent models has a large uncertainty
$M_{50} = 3.16^{+9.34}_{-2.37}\times 10^{10}$$h^{-1}{\rm{M_{\odot}}}$. However,
we find that the same individual models have a relatively tight $1\sigma$
scatter around the median mass $\Delta M_{1\sigma} = 0.55^{+0.11}_{-0.31}$ dex.
We are also able to show that \focc\ is uniquely determined by $M_{\rm min}$,
regardless of $M_{\rm max}$. We argue that upcoming large surveys covering at
least $25$ deg$^{2}$ should be able to put tighter constraints on $M_{\rm min}$

evaluated in relation to fundamental stellar evolution parameters: the stellar
initial mass and pulsation period. Circumstellar $^{13}$C$^{16}$O,
$^{12}$C$^{17}$O and $^{12}$C$^{18}$O line observations were obtained for a
sample of nine stars with various single-dish long-wavelength facilities. Line
intensity ratios are shown to relate directly to the surface $^{17}$O/$^{18}$O
abundance ratio. Stellar evolution models predict the $^{17}$O/$^{18}$O ratio
to be a sensitive function of initial mass and to remain constant throughout
the entire TP-AGB phase for stars initially less massive than 5\,$M_{\odot}$.
This makes the measured ratio a probe of the initial stellar mass. Observed
$^{17}$O/$^{18}$O ratios are found to be well in the range predicted by stellar
evolution models that do not consider convective overshooting. From this,
accurate initial mass estimates are calculated for seven sources. For the
remaining two sources two mass solutions result, though with a larger
probability that the low-mass solution is the correct one. Finally, hints at a
possible separation between M/S- and C-type stars when comparing the
$^{17}$O/$^{18}$O ratio to the stellar pulsation period are presented.

spectroscopy to probe the morphology and kinematics of the ionized gas in four
velocity-offset active galactic nuclei (AGNs) from the Sloan Digital Sky
Survey. These objects possess optical emission lines that are offset in
velocity from systemic as measured from stellar absorption features. At a
resolution of ~0.18"", OSIRIS allows us to distinguish which velocity offset
emission lines are produced by the motion of an AGN in a dual supermassive
black hole system, and which are produced by outflows or other kinematic
structures. In three galaxies, J1018+2941, J1055+1520 and J1346+5228, the
spectral offset of the emission lines is caused by AGN-driven outflows. In the
remaining galaxy, J1117+6140, a counterrotating nuclear disk is observed that
contains the peak of Pa$\alpha$ emission 0.2"" from the center of the galaxy.
The most plausible explanation for the origin of this spatially and
kinematically offset peak is that it is a region of enhanced Pa$\alpha$
emission located at the intersection zone between the nuclear disk and the bar
of the galaxy. In all four objects, the peak of ionized gas emission is not
spatially coincident with the center of the galaxy as traced by the peak of the
near-IR continuum emission. The peaks of ionized gas emission are spatially
offset from the galaxy centers by 0.1""-0.4"" (0.1-0.7 kpc). We find that the
velocity offset originates at the location of this peak of emission, and the
value of the offset can be directly measured in the velocity maps. The
emission-line ratios of these four velocity-offset AGNs can be reproduced only
with a mixture of shocks and AGN photoionization. Shocks provide a natural
explanation for the origin of the spatially and spectrally offset peaks of
ionized gas emission in these galaxies.

physically motivated ab initio model for blazar flares based on the results of
recent particle-in-cell (PIC) simulations of relativistic magnetic
reconnection. PIC simulations demonstrate that quasi-spherical plasmoids filled
with high-energy particles and magnetic fields are a self-consistent by-product
of the reconnection process. By coupling our PIC-based results (i.e., plasmoid
growth, acceleration profile, particle and magnetic content) with a kinetic
equation for the evolution of the electron distribution function we demonstrate
that relativistic reconnection in blazar jets can produce powerful flares whose
temporal and spectral properties are consistent with the observations. In
particular, our model predicts correlated synchrotron and synchrotron
self-Compton flares of duration of several hours--days powered by the largest
and slowest moving plasmoids that form in the reconnection layer. Smaller and
faster plasmoids produce flares of sub-hour duration with higher peak
luminosities than those powered by the largest plasmoids. Yet, the observed
fluence in both types of flares is similar. Multiple flares with a range of
flux-doubling timescales (minutes to several hours) observed over a longer
period of flaring activity (days or longer) may be used as a probe of the
reconnection layer's orientation and the jet's magnetization. Our model shows
that blazar flares are naturally expected as a result of magnetic reconnection
in a magnetically-dominated jet.

crucial to precisely measuring distances and mapping the distribution of dark

acquire simultaneous-multicolor images with an acuity of 0.07-0.10"" across the
entire visible spectrum (20% i'-band Strehl in median conditions) and <0.16"" in
the near infrared, and will detect companions at 0.5"" at contrast ratio of

detectable as nitrate ion spikes in ice cores. They use the high fluence, high
energy (hard spectrum) SPE of 23 February 1956 to calculate an enhancement of
HNO3 from the surface to 46 km that is equivalent to a ~120 ng cm-2 nitrate ion
spike observed in the GISP2H ice core. The Melott et al. [2016] approach is
fundamentally flawed, since it considers only the absolute column burden of
SPE-produced nitrate and not the pre-existing nitrate in the stratosphere.
Modeling studies supported by extensive observations [Duderstadt et al., 2014,
2016, and this comment] show background HNO3 in the lower and middle
stratosphere equivalent to 2000 to 3000 ng cm-2 nitrate. These high levels of
background nitrate must also be included when estimating SPE enhancements to
the deposition of nitrate ions that might eventually be preserved in an ice
core. The 1956 SPE results in less than a 5% increase in the column burden of
atmospheric HNO3, not large enough to explain the nitrate spike seen in the
GISP2H ice core. Even extreme SPE enhancements cannot explain nitrate peaks
(typically hundreds of percent increases) observed in the ice record
[Duderstadt et al., 2016]. Realistic mechanisms linking nitrate ions in ice
cores to SPEs have not been established. It is time to move the search for
indicators of SPEs away from nitrate ions: Nitrate ions cannot be used as
proxies for individual SPEs in the ice core record.

Cosmic Dawn ($z\sim30$). During these epochs, early stars and black holes
heated and ionized the IGM, introducing fluctuations in 21 cm emission. HERA is
designed to characterize the evolution of the 21 cm power spectrum to constrain
the timing and morphology of reionization, the properties of the first
galaxies, the evolution of large-scale structure, and the early sources of
heating. The full HERA instrument will be a 350-element interferometer in South
Africa consisting of 14-m parabolic dishes observing from 50 to 250 MHz.
Currently, 19 dishes have been deployed on site and the next 18 are under
construction. HERA has been designated as an SKA Precursor instrument.
  In this paper, we summarize HERA's scientific context and provide forecasts
for its key science results. After reviewing the current state of the art in
foreground mitigation, we use the delay-spectrum technique to motivate
high-level performance requirements for the HERA instrument. Next, we present

that HERA meets its performance requirements. Finally, we summarize the

realities of foreground contamination, current-generation 21 cm instruments are
approaching their sensitivity limits. HERA is designed to bring both the
sensitivity and the precision to deliver its primary science on the basis of
proven foreground filtering techniques, while developing new subtraction
techniques to unlock new capabilities. The result will be a major step toward
realizing the widely recognized scientific potential of 21 cm cosmology.

spectrum. We discuss the mechanism for giving the spin $\frac{3}{2}$ field a
mass by the BEH mechanism, and analyze the remaining massless spin
$\frac{1}{2}$ fermions, the global chiral symmetries, and the running couplings
after symmetry breaking. We note that the smallest gluon mass matrix eigenvalue
has an eigenvector suggestive of $U(1)_{B-L}$, and conjecture that the theory
runs to an infrared fixed point at which there is a massless gluon with 3 to -1
ratios in generator components. Assuming this, we discuss a mechanism for
making contact with the standard model, based on a conjectured asymmetric
breaking of $Sp(4)$ to $SU(2)$ subgroups, one of which is the electroweak
$SU(2)$, and the other of which is a ""technicolor"" group that binds the
original $SU(8)$ model fermions, which play the role of ""preons"", into
composites. Quarks can emerge as 5 preon composites and leptons as 3 preon
composites, with consequent stability of the proton against decay to a single
lepton plus a meson. A composite Higgs boson can emerge as a two preon
composite. Since anomaly matching for the relevant conserved global symmetry
current is not obeyed by three fermion families, emergence of three composite
families requires formation of a Goldstone boson with quantum numbers matching
this current, which can be a light dark matter candidate.

for the unique maximum element in this poset in terms of paths in the quantum

Key to establishing this connection is the fact that paths in the quantum
Bruhat graph encode saturated chains in the strong Bruhat order on the affine
Weyl group. This correspondence is also fundamental in the work of Lam and
Shimozono establishing Peterson's isomorphism between the quantum cohomology of
the finite flag variety and the homology of the affine Grassmannian. One
important geometric application of the present work is an inequality which

multi-user massive MIMO relay networks, where the relay is equipped with
massive antennas and uses MRC/MRT for low-complexity processing. CSI error is
considered. First, a sum-rate lower bound is derived which manifests the effect
of system parameters including the numbers of relay antennas and users, the CSI
quality, and the transmit powers of the sources and the relay. Via a general
scaling model on the system parameters with respect to the relay antenna
number, the asymptotic scaling law of the SINR as a function of the parameter
scalings is obtained, which shows quantitatively the tradeoff between the
network parameters and their effect on the network performance. In addition, a
sufficient condition on the parameter scalings for the SINR to be
asymptotically deterministic is given, which covers existing studies on such
analysis as special cases. Then, the scenario where the SINR increases linearly
with the relay antenna number is studied. The sufficient and necessary
condition on the parameter scaling for this scenario is proved. It is shown
that in this case, the interference power is not asymptotically deterministic,
then its distribution is derived, based on which the outage probability and
average bit error rate of the relay network are analysed.

binary supermassive black holes (SBHs) in galactic nuclei. In our model,
massive binaries evolve at early times via gravitational-slingshot interaction
with nearby stars, and at later times by the emission of GWs. Our expressions
for the rate of binary hardening in the ""stellar"" regime are taken from the
recent work of Vasiliev et al., who show that in the non-axisymmetric galaxies
expected to form via mergers, stars are supplied to the center at high enough
rates to ensure binary coalescence on Gyr timescales. We also include, for the
first time, the extra degrees of freedom associated with evolution of the
binary's orbital plane; in rotating nuclei, interaction with stars causes the
orientation and the eccentricity of a massive binary to change in tandem,
leading in some cases to very high eccentricities (e>0.9) before the binary
enters the GW-dominated regime. We argue that previous studies have
over-estimated the mean ratio of SBH mass to galaxy bulge mass by factors of 2
- 3. In the frequency regime currently accessible to pulsar timing arrays

strain compared with the values computed in most recent studies, removing the

conservation of particle number in many-body perturbation theory. To do this we
extend the concept of $\Phi$-derivability for the self-energy $\Sigma$ to a
larger class of diagrammatic terms in which only some of the Green's function
lines contain the fully dressed Green's function $G$. We call the corresponding
approximations for $\Sigma$ partially $\Phi$-derivable. A special subclass of
such approximations, which are gauge-invariant, is obtained by dressing loops
in the diagrammatic expansion of $\Phi$ consistently with $G$. These
approximations are number conserving but do not have to fulfill other
conservation laws, such as the conservation of energy and momentum. From our
formalism we can easily deduce if commonly used approximations will fulfill the
continuity equation, which implies particle number conservation. We further
show how the concept of partial $\Phi$-derivability plays an important role in
the derivation of a generalized sum rule for the particle number, which reduces
to the Luttinger-Ward theorem in the case of a homogeneous electron gas, and
the Friedel sum rule in the case of the Anderson model. To do this we need to
ensure that the Green's function has certain complex analytic properties, which
can be guaranteed if the spectral function is positive semi-definite.The latter
property can be ensured for a subset of partially $\Phi$-derivable
approximations for the self-energy, namely those that can be constructed from
squares of so-called half-diagrams. In case the analytic requirements are not
fulfilled we highlight a number of subtle issues related to branch cuts, pole
structure and multi-valuedness. We also show that various schemes of computing

Dirichlet form (i.e. norm of a gradient). In this paper we prove a family of

comparison between the entropy and the Dirichlet form and improve on the usual
LSIs for functions with small support. These non-linear LSIs, in turn, imply a
new version of the hypercontractivity for such functions. As another
consequence, we derive a sharp form of the uncertainty principle for the
hypercube: a function whose energy is concentrated on a set of small size, and
whose Fourier energy is concentrated on a small Hamming ball must be zero. The
tradeoff between the sizes that we derive is asymptotically optimal. This new
uncertainty principle implies a new estimate on the size of Fourier
coefficients of sparse Boolean functions. We observe that an analogous
(asymptotically optimal) uncertainty principle in the Euclidean space follows
from the sharp form of Young's inequality due to Beckner. This hints that
non-linear LSIs augment Young's inequality (which itself is sharp for finite
groups).

multidimensional scaling and semidefinite programming are chosen for this
research. Multidimensional scaling is a simple mathematical technique
widely-discussed that solves the wireless sensor networks localization problem.
In contrast, semidefinite programming is a relatively new field of optimization
with a growing use, although being more complex. In this paper, using extensive
simulations, a detailed overview of these two approaches is given, regarding
different network topologies, various network parameters and performance
issues. The performances of both techniques are highly satisfactory and

Different routing protocols exist each with its own benefits, but it is

  We examine several desirable properties, such as robustness, which ensures
adding nodes and edges does not change the routing in a radical, unpredictable

whether larger sight always contributes to better outcomes. Then we develop a
simple logical special-purpose language to formally express some key properties

call for substantial enrichments of existing fixed-point logics that have been
developed for the classical BI solution concept. We also discuss changes in
earlier modal logics expressing ""surface reasoning"" about best actions in the

applicable connection between knowledge and action in multi-agent systems.
Roughly speaking, it asserts that if some condition is a necessary condition
for performing a given action A, then knowing that this condition holds is also
a necessary condition for performing A. Since the specifications of tasks often
involve necessary conditions for actions, the KoP principle shows that such
specifications induce knowledge preconditions for the actions. Distributed
protocols or multi-agent plans that satisfy the specifications must ensure that
this knowledge be attained, and that it is detected by the agents as a
condition for action. The knowledge of preconditions principle is formalised in
the runs and systems framework, and is proven to hold in a wide class of
settings. Well-known connections between knowledge and coordinated action are
extended and shown to derive directly from the KoP principle: a ""common
knowledge of preconditions"" principle is established showing that common
knowledge is a necessary condition for performing simultaneous actions, and a
""nested knowledge of preconditions"" principle is proven, showing that
coordinating actions to be performed in linear temporal order requires a
corresponding form of nested knowledge.

results in one-bit compressive sensing rely on the assumption that the signals

practical applications, signals are sparse with respect to an overcomplete

this important model, providing a unified theory of one-bit compressive sensing
under dictionary sparsity. Specifically, we analyze several different

that, under natural assumptions on the sensing matrix (satisfied by Gaussian

cooperation, assuming what Halpern and Pass call translucent players.
Typically, players are assumed to be opaque, in the sense that a deviation by
one player in a normal-form game does not affect the strategies used by other
players. But a player may believe that if he switches from one strategy to
another, the fact that he chooses to switch may be visible to the other
players. For example, if he chooses to defect in Prisoner's Dilemma, the other
player may sense his guilt. We show that by assuming translucent players, we
can recover many of the regularities observed in human behavior in well-studied
games such as Prisoner's Dilemma, Traveler's Dilemma, Bertrand Competition, and
the Public Goods game.

million years ago. CAIs are almost always surrounded by Wark-Lovering Rims
(WLRs), which are a sequence of thin, mono/bi-mineralic layers of refractory
minerals, with a total thickness in the range of 1 to 100 microns. Recently,
some CAIs have been found that have tektite-like bowl-shapes. To form such
shapes, the CAI must have travelled through a rarefied gas at hypersonic
speeds. We show how CAIs may have been ejected from the inner solar accretion
disc via the centrifugal interaction between the solar magnetosphere and the
inner disc rim. They subsequently punched through the hot, inner disc rim wall
at hypersonic speeds. This re-entry heating partially or completely evaporated
the CAIs. Such evaporation could have significantly increased the metal
abundances of the inner disc rim. High speed movement through the inner disc
produced WLRs. To match the observed thickness of WLRs required metal
abundances at the inner disc wall that are of order ten times that of standard
solar abundances. The CAIs cooled as they moved away from the protosun, the
deduced CAI cooling rates are consistent with the CAI cooling rates obtained
from experiment and observation. The speeds and gas densities required to form
bowl-shaped CAIs are also consistent with the expected speeds and gas densities
for larger, ~ 1 cm, CAIs punching through an inner accretion disc wall.

in a narrow temperature and magnetic-field region just below the magnetic

survive over a very wide temperature and magnetic-field region, including down
to zero temperature and up to the critical magnetic field of the ferromagnetic

undergo reversible transitions between a conventional triangular lattice and a

regularization for quantum criticality with a Fermi surface, we examine a
metal-insulator quantum phase transition from a Landau's Fermi-liquid state to
a U(1) spin-liquid phase with a spinon Fermi surface in two dimensions.
Unfortunately, we fail to approach the spin-liquid Mott quantum critical point
from the U(1) spin-liquid state within the dimensional regularization
technique. Self-interactions between charge fluctuations called holons are not
screened, which shows a run-away renormalization group flow, interpreted as
holons remain gapped. This leads us to consider another fixed point, where the
spinon Fermi surface can be destabilized across the Mott transition. Based on
this conjecture, we reveal the nature of the spin-liquid Mott quantum critical
point: Dimensional reduction to one dimension occurs for spin dynamics
described by spinons. As a result, Landau damping for both spin and charge
dynamics disappear in the vicinity of the Mott quantum critical point. When the
flavor number of holons is over its critical value, an interacting fixed point
appears to be identified with an inverted XY universality class, controlled
within the dimensional regularization technique. On the other hand, a
fluctuation-driven first order metal-insulator transition results when it is
below the critical number. We propose that the destabilization of a spinon
Fermi surface and the emergence of one-dimensional spin dynamics near the
spin-liquid Mott quantum critical point can be checked out by spin
susceptibility with a $2 k_{F}$ transfer momentum, where $k_{F}$ is a Fermi
momentum in the U(1) spin-liquid state: The absence of Landau damping in U(1)
gauge fluctuations gives rise to a divergent behavior at zero temperature while
it vanishes in the presence of a spinon Fermi surface.

age peers and their younger counterparts by a larger number of intermediaries.
Variation in the small world effect is specific to age as a node attribute
(being absent in the case of gender) and is consistently observed under several
data robustness checks. The discovery of age-specific small worlds is
consistent with well-known social mechanisms affecting the way age interacts
with network connectivity and the relative prevalence of kin ties and non-kin
ties observed in this network. This social pattern has significant implications
for our understanding of generation-specific dynamics of information cascades,
diffusion phenomena, and the spread of fads and fashions.

functional languages. We present a dynamic approach to explaining type errors
by generating counterexample witness inputs that illustrate how an ill-typed
program goes wrong. First, given an ill-typed function, we symbolically execute
the body to synthesize witness values that make the program go wrong. We prove
that our procedure synthesizes general witnesses in that if a witness is found,
then for all inhabited input types, there exist values that can make the
function go wrong. Second, we show how to extend this procedure to produce a
reduction graph that can be used to interactively visualize and debug witness
executions. Third, we evaluate the coverage of our approach on two data sets
comprising over 4,500 ill-typed student programs. Our technique is able to
generate witnesses for around 85% of the programs, our reduction graph yields
small counterexamples for over 80% of the witnesses, and a simple heuristic
allows us to use witnesses to locate the source of type errors with around 70%
accuracy. Finally, we evaluate whether our witnesses help students understand
and fix type errors, and find that students presented with our witnesses show a
greater understanding of type errors than those presented with a standard error
message.

between nuclear structure and fusion. Exotic beam facilities open new
perspectives to understand the impact of neutron skin, large isospin, and weak
binding energies on fusion. Microscopic theories of fusion are required to
guide future experiments.
  [Purpose] To investigate new effects of exotic structures and dynamics in
near-barrier fusion with exotic nuclei.
  [Method] Microscopic approaches based on the Hartree-Fock (HF) mean-field
theory are used for studying fusion barriers in $^{40-54}$Ca+$^{116}$Sn
reactions for even isotopes. Bare potential barriers are obtained assuming
frozen HF ground-state densities. Dynamical effects on the barrier are
accounted for in time-dependent Hartree-Fock (TDHF) calculations of the
collisions. Vibrational couplings are studied in the coupled-channel framework
and near-barrier nucleon transfer is investigated with TDHF calculations.
  [Results] The development of a neutron skin in exotic calcium isotopes
strongly lowers the bare potential barrier. However, this static effect is not
apparent when dynamical effects are included. On the contrary, a fusion
hindrance is observed in TDHF calculations with the most neutron rich calcium
isotopes which cannot be explained by vibrational couplings. Transfer reactions
are also important in these systems due to charge equilibration processes.
  [Conclusions] Despite its impact on the bare potential, the neutron skin is
not seen as playing an important role in the fusion dynamics. However, the
charge transfer with exotic projectiles could lead to an increase of the
Coulomb repulsion between the fragments, suppressing fusion. The effect of
transfer and dissipative mechanisms on fusion with exotic nuclei deserve
further studies.

with electrons and are deflected from nuclei due to multiple Coulomb

recent developments on position sensitive muon detectors indicate that multiple
Coulomb scattering could be an excellent candidate for spent nuclear fuel
imaging. Muons present significant advantages over existing monitoring and
imaging techniques and can play a central role in monitoring nuclear waste and
spent nuclear fuel stored in dense well shielded containers. The main purpose
of this paper is to investigate the applicability of multiple Coulomb
scattering for imaging of spent nuclear fuel dry casks stored within vertical
and horizontal commercial storage dry casks. Calculations of muon scattering
were performed for various scenarios, including vertical and horizontal fully
loaded dry casks, half loaded dry casks, dry casks with one row of fuel
assemblies missing, dry casks with one fuel assembly missing and empty dry
casks. Various detector sizes (1.2 m x 1.2 m, 2.4 m x 2.4 m and 3.6 m x 3.6 m)
and number of muons ($10^{5}, 5\cdot10^{5}, 10^{6}$ and $10^{7}$) were used to
assess the effect on image resolution. The Point-of-Closest-Approach (PoCA)
algorithm was used for the reconstruction of the stored contents. The results
demonstrate that multiple Coulomb scattering can be used to successfully
reconstruct the dry cask contents and allow identification of all scenarios
with the exception of one fuel assembly missing. In this case, an indication
exists that a fuel assembly is not present; however the resolution of the
imaging algorithm was not enough to identify exact location.

excitations in a 2D topological system can transform under symmetry in a
fractional way. For example in fractional quantum Hall systems, excitations can
carry fractional charges while the electrons making up the system have charge
one. An important question is to understand what symmetry fractionalization
(SF) patterns are possible given different types of topological order and
different symmetries. A lot of progress has been made recently in classifying
the SF patterns, providing deep insight into the strongly correlated
experimental signatures of systems like spin liquids and topological
insulators. We review recent developments on this topic. First, it was shown
that the SF patterns need to satisfy some simple consistency conditions. More
interesting, it was realized that some seemingly consistent SF patterns are
actually `anomalous', i.e. they cannot be realized in strictly 2D systems. We
review various methods that have been developed to detect such anomalies.
Applying such an understanding to 2D spin liquid allows one to enumerate all
potentially realizable SF patterns and propose numerical and experimental
probing methods to distinguish them. On the other hand, the anomalous SF
patterns were shown to exist on the surface of 3D systems and reflect the
nontrivial order in the 3D bulk. We review examples of this kind where the bulk
states are topological insulators, topological superconductors, or have other
symmetry protected topological orders.

profiles and performing bulge+disk decompositions. We analyze $\sim$ 250
massive galaxies selected from all CANDELS fields (COSMOS, UDS, EGS,
GOODS-South and GOODS-North). We confirm that both star-forming and quiescent
galaxies increase their sizes significantly from $\emph{z}$ $\approx$ 2.5 to
the present day. The global S\'{e}rsic index of quiescent galaxies increases
over time (from $n$ $\approx$ 2.5 to $n$ $>$ 4), while that of star-forming
galaxies remains roughly constant ($n$ $\approx$ 2.5). By decomposing galaxy
profiles into bulge+disk components, we find that massive galaxies at high
redshift have prominent stellar disks, which are also evident from visual
inspection of the images. By $z$ $\approx$ 0.5, the majority of the disks
disappear and massive quiescent galaxies begin to resemble the local elliptical
galaxies. Star-forming galaxies have lower bulge-to-total ratios ($B/T$) than
their quiescent counterparts at each redshift bin. The bulges of star-forming
and quiescent galaxies follow different evolutionary histories, while their
disks evolve similarly. We conclude that major mergers, along with minor
mergers, have played a crucial role in the significant size increase of
high-\emph{z} galaxies and the destruction of their massive and large-scale

addition, nonlinear dynamic friction and backlash cause challenges to provide
haptic feedback to the surgeons when the robotic arms are inside the patient's

haptic devices and subsequently to the surgeons. To deal with these problems,
in this paper we propose a new approach of friction model in the tendon-sheath
mechanism to provide the force at distal end of endoscopic system. In
comparison with current approaches in the literature, the proposed model is
able to provide force information at zero velocity and it is smooth. In
addition, the model is independent configuration and able to capture friction
force with any complex sheath shapes. A suitable experimental setup is
established to validate the proposed approach using the two degrees of freedom

good agreement between the estimated model and real experimental data. Finally,
a force feedback structure is also given for use in flexible endoscopic

proven to be fruitful to introduce the notion of a finite-size-pseudo-critical

fluctuations as a function of the size. For the Many-Body-Localization
transition, where very strong eigenstate-to-eigenstate fluctuations have been

the correlation length exponent $\nu$. The scaling properties of critical
eigenstates are also expected to appear much more clearly if one considers each

critical', while standard averages over eigenstates and samples in the critical

Chebyshev (PEC) Space. In such a space one can count the total number of zeroes
of any non-zero element, exactly as in each EC-section-space. When this number
is bounded above in the global space the same way as in its section-spaces, we
say that it is an Extended Chebyshev Piecewise (ECP) space. A thorough study of
ECP-spaces has been developed in the last two decades in relation to blossoms,
with a view to design. In particular, extending a classical procedure for
EC-spaces, ECP-spaces were recently proved to all be obtained by means of
piecewise generalised derivatives. This yields an interesting constructive
characterisation of ECP-spaces. Unfortunately, except for low dimensions and
for very few adjacent intervals, this characterisation proved to be rather
difficult to handle in practice. To try to overcome this difficulty, in the
present article we show how to reinterpret the constructive characterisation as
a theoretical procedure to determine whether or not a given PEC-space is an
ECP-space. This procedure is then translated into a numerical test, whose
usefulness is illustrated by relevant examples.

currently not well understood. We compile a catalogue of 389 massive
main-sequence stars, 61 of which are magnetic, and derive their fundamental
parameters and ages. The two samples contain stars brighter than magnitude 9 in
the V band and range in mass between 5 and 100 Msun. We find that the
fractional main-sequence age distribution of all considered stars follows what
is expected for a magnitude limited sample, while that of magnetic stars shows
a clear decrease towards the end of the main sequence. This dearth of old
magnetic stars is independent of the choice of adopted stellar evolution
tracks, and appears to become more prominent when considering only the most
massive stars. We show that the decreasing trend in the distribution is
significantly stronger than expected from magnetic flux conservation. We also
find that binary rejuvenation and magnetic suppression of core convection are
unlikely to be responsible for the observed lack of older magnetic massive
stars, and conclude that its most probable cause is the decay of the magnetic
field, over a time span longer than the stellar lifetime for the lowest
considered masses, and shorter for the highest masses. We then investigate the
spin-down ages of the slowly rotating magnetic massive stars and find them to
exceed the stellar ages by far in many cases. The high fraction of very slowly
rotating magnetic stars thus provides an independent argument for a decay of
the magnetic fields.

the past, though past geodesically incomplete. This model starts with an
inflationary era, follows with a stiff matter dominated period and evolves to
accelerated expansion in an asymptotically de Sitter regime in a realistic
fashion. The big bang singularity is replaced by a directional singularity.
This singularity cannot be reached by comoving observers, since it would take
them an infinite proper time lapse to go back to it. On the contrary, observers
with nonzero linear momentum have the singularity at finite proper time in
their past, though arbitrarily large. Hence, the time lapse from the initial
singularity can be as long as desired, even infinity, depending on the linear
momentum of the observer. This conclusion applies to similar inflationary

Language Processing tasks. However, existing models still have a couple of
limitations in interpreting the dimensions of word vector. In this paper, we
provide a new approach---roots and affixes model(RAAM)---to interpret it from
the intrinsic structures of natural language. Also it can be used as an
evaluation measure of the quality of word embedding. We introduce the
information entropy into our model and divide the dimensions into two
categories, just like roots and affixes in lexical semantics. Then considering
each category as a whole rather than individually. We experimented with English
Wikipedia corpus. Our result show that there is a negative linear relation
between the two attributes and a high positive correlation between our model

  Bayes classifier works by using a set of evidences and a set of classes. By
training the system using sample data, we can determine the probability of an
evidence given a particular class. Bayes classifier also uses prior probability
of a class, which can be calculated from sample data. From these analysis, when
given a new document which is formed by a set of evidences (words), the
probabilities of each class given that document (posterior probabilities) can
be determined.
  This system is implemented using PHP 5, Apache, and MySQL. The conclusion
from building this system is that the Bayes method can be used to automatically

that satisfy certain consistency requirements like gauge invariance and
perturbative unitarity. As a well-motivated example, we study two-mediator DM
(2MDM). The model is based on a spontaneously broken $U(1)'$ gauge symmetry and
contains a Majorana DM particle as well as two $s$-channel mediators, one
vector (the $Z'$) and one scalar (the dark Higgs). We perform a global scan
over the parameters of the model assuming that the DM relic density is obtained
by thermal freeze-out in the early Universe and imposing a large set of
constraints: direct and indirect DM searches, monojet, dijet and dilepton
searches at colliders, Higgs observables, electroweak precision tests and
perturbative unitarity. We conclude that thermal DM is only allowed either
close to an $s$-channel resonance or if at least one mediator is lighter than
the DM particle. In these cases a thermal DM abundance can be obtained although
DM couplings to the Standard Model are tiny. Interestingly, we find that
vector-mediated DM-nucleon scattering leads to relevant constraints despite the
velocity-suppressed cross section, and that indirect detection can be important
if DM annihilations into both mediators are kinematically allowed.

Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction is shown to possess Weyl points, i.\,e.,
pairs of topological nontrivial crossings of two magnon branches with opposite
topological charge. As a consequence of their topological nature, their
projections onto a surface are connected by magnon arcs, thereby resembling
closely Fermi arcs of electronic Weyl semimetals. On top of this, the positions
of the Weyl points in reciprocal space can be tuned widely by an external
magnetic field: rotated within the surface plane, the Weyl points and magnon
arcs are rotated as well; tilting the magnetic field out-of-plane shifts the
Weyl points toward the center $\bar{\Gamma}$ of the surface Brillouin zone. The
theory is valid for the class of ferromagnetic pyrochlores, i.\,e.,
three-dimensional extensions of topological magnon insulators on kagome

Internet-wide TTL behavior at carrier scale and evaluate its fit to detect

hosts exhibit one stable TTL value. Active measurements on unstable hosts yield
a stable anchor TTL value for more than 85% of responsive hosts. We develop a

stability into account. Correlation of TTL values with BGP data is clear, yet
unpredictive. The results indicate that carrier-grade TTL anomaly detection can

motion of calls crawling on a substrate using a pseudopod, we constructed a

locomotion (CIL) naturally. The model cell consists of two disks, one in the
front (a pseudopod) and the other one in the back (cell body), connected by a
finitely extensible spring. Despite the simplicity of the model, the cells'
collective behavior is highly nontrivial, depending on the shape of cells and
whether CIL is enabled or not. Cells with a small front circle (i.e. a narrow
pseudopod) form immobile colonies. In contrast, cells with a large front circle
(i.e. such as a lamellipodium) exhibit coherent migration without any explicit
alignment mechanism being present in the model. This suggests that crawling
cells often exhibit broad fronts because it helps them avoid clustering. Upon
increasing the density, the cells develop density waves which propagate against
the direction of cell migration and finally arrest at higher densities.

in a tower of KK bulk neutrinos which are sterile in nature and couple to the
active neutrinos in the brane. The active-sterile mixing probability strongly
depends on the angle $\theta$ due to changing pattern of KK mass gaps which
leads to level crossing. Considering only the first two lowest KK states in
analogy with $(3+2)$ model, it is shown that $|U_{\alpha 4}| > |U_{\alpha 5}|$
when $\theta = \pi/2$ corresponding to the case of a normal torus. Since
$\Delta_{14}^2 < \Delta_{15}^2$, this is expected in normal LED model as higher
the sterile mass lower is the mixing probability. Contrary to this expectation,
it is found that there exists a range in $\theta$ where $|U_{\alpha 5}| \ge
|U_{\alpha 4}|$ even though $\Delta m_{14}^2 < \Delta m_{15}^2$ which has been
demonstrated qantitatively using fourier transformation of reactor

the oscillation parameters extracted by several $(3+2)$ global analyses of the

that the probability of the drift term should fall off exponentially or faster

optimization criteria for Reinforcement Learning: i) maximization of the mean

ourselves in the framework of policy search algorithms, that are usually
designed to maximize the mean value, and derive a method that minimizes the
residual $\|T_* v_\pi - v_\pi\|_{1,\nu}$ over policies. A theoretical analysis
shows how good this proxy is to policy optimization, and notably that it is
better than its value-based counterpart. We also propose experiments on
randomly generated generic Markov decision processes, specifically designed for
studying the influence of the involved concentrability coefficient. They show
that the Bellman residual is generally a bad proxy to policy optimization and
that directly maximizing the mean value is much better, despite the current
lack of deep theoretical analysis. This might seem obvious, as directly
addressing the problem of interest is usually better, but given the prevalence
of (projected) Bellman residual minimization in value-based reinforcement
learning, we believe that this question is worth to be considered.

report the synthesis of ordered arrays of poly(p-phenylene) chains on the
surface of semiconducting TiO2(110) via a dehalogenative homocoupling of
4,4""-dibromoterphenyl precursors. The supramolecular phase is clearly
distinguished from the polymeric one using low energy electron diffraction and
scanning tunneling microscopy as the substrate temperature used for deposition
is varied. X ray photoelectron spectroscopy of C 1s and Br 3d core levels
traces the temperature of the onset of dehalogenation to around 475 K.
Moreover, angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy and tight-binding
calculations identify a highly dispersive band characteristic of a substantial
overlap between the precursor's {\pi} states along the polymer, considered as
the fingerprint of a successful polymerization. Thus, these results establish
the first spectroscopic evidence that atomically precise carbon based

corresponds to a regime of fast enough graph dynamics. Our proof is based on a

the walk moves along an edge that was rewired before, which turns out to be

stochastic B-H curve is presented and analyzed with regard to monotonicity
constraints. A stochastic non-linear curl-curl formulation is introduced and
numerically approximated by a finite element and collocation method in the

is analyzed by a higher order sensitivity analysis. It is shown that, unlike to

However, we are not always so luck. In the case of GW151226, the time of a

technique for interpolating scattered data. But, solving large RBF
interpolation problems without fast summation methods is computationally
expensive. For RBF interpolation with $N$ points, using a direct method

$\mathcal{O}(N^{1.5})$ and even to $\mathcal{O}(NlogN)$ for the multilevel fast

fast multipole method for RBF interpolation, which is used in combination with
the evaluation of point-to-point interactions by RBF and the fast matrix-vector

quadrature rules, which extends the range of applicability of FMM.

characteristic for the stochastic process that generates them? Within the
context of stochastic geometry and the physics of disordered materials, this
corresponds to the question of relationships between different stochastic
models. In the context of image analysis of synthetic and biological materials,
this question is central to the problem of inferring information about
formation processes from spatial measurements of resulting random structures.
We address this question by a theory-based simulation study of shape indices
derived from Minkowski tensors for a variety of tessellation models. We focus
on the relationship between two indices: an isoperimetric ratio of the
empirical averages of cell volume and area and the cell elongation quantified
by eigenvalue ratios of interfacial Minkowski tensors. Simulation data for
these quantities, as well as for distributions thereof and for correlations of
cell shape and volume, are presented for Voronoi mosaics of the Poisson point
process, determinantal and permanental point processes, and Gibbs hard-core and
random sequential absorption processes as well as for Laguerre tessellations of
polydisperse spheres and STIT- and Poisson hyperplane tessellations. These data
are complemented by mechanically stable crystalline sphere and disordered
ellipsoid packings and area-minimising foam models. We find that shape indices
of individual cells are not sufficient to unambiguously identify the generating
process even amongst this limited set of processes. However, we identify
significant differences of the shape indices between many of these tessellation
models. Given a realization of a tessellation, these shape indices can narrow
the choice of possible generating processes, providing a powerful tool which
can be further strengthened by density-resolved volume-shape correlations.

SO(3) and spin SU(2) symmetry and describes systems with partially occupied
$t_{2g}$ shells. We focus on the case with two electrons in the impurity that
is relevant to Hund's metals. Using the Schrieffer-Wolff transformation we
derive an effective Kondo model with couplings between the bulk and impurity
electrons expressed in terms of spin, orbital, and orbital quadrupole
operators. The bare spin-spin Kondo interaction is much smaller than the
orbit-orbit and spin-orbital couplings or is even ferromagnetic. Furthermore,
the perturbative scaling equations indicate faster renormalization of the
couplings related to orbital degrees of freedom compared to spin degrees of
freedom. Both mechanisms lead to a slow screening of the local spin moment. The
model thus behaves similarly to the related quantum impurity problem with a
larger SU(3) orbital symmetry (Dworin-Narath interaction) where this was first
observed. We find that the two problems actually describe the same low-energy
physics since the SU(3) symmetry is dynamically established through the
renormalization of the splittings of coupling constants to zero. The
perturbative renormalization group results are corroborated with the
numerical-renormalization group (NRG) calculations. The dependence of spin
Kondo temperatures and orbital Kondo temperatures as a function of interaction
parameters, the hybridization, and the impurity occupancy is calculated and
discussed.

graphene are studied using density functional perturbation theory (DFPT) under
quasi harmonic approximation. The dynamical matrix and the phonon frequencies
were calculated using VASP code in interface with phonopy code. The approach is
first applied to pure graphene to calculate thermal expansion. The results
agree with earlier calculations using similar approach. Thereafter we have
studied the effect of B/N doping on LTEC and also compared it with LTEC of h-BN

information that is stored in their indices, but could also ""understand"" it and
synthesise it into a single document? We present a preliminary study that makes
a first step towards answering this question. Given a query, we train a
Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) on existing relevant information to that query.
We then use the RNN to ""deep learn"" a single, synthetic, and we assume,
relevant document for that query. We design a crowdsourcing experiment to
assess how relevant the ""deep learned"" document is, compared to existing
relevant documents. Users are shown a query and four wordclouds (of three
existing relevant documents and our deep learned synthetic document). The
synthetic document is ranked on average most relevant of all.

homogeneous setting. We also use this control of superlinear moments to extend
a recent result about the regularity of the solutions in the pure coagulation

probabilistic model for the observations, which are assumed to come from
several catchments. Our suggested latent model is Gaussian and designed for
monthly maxima, making better use of the data than the standard approach using
annual maxima. At the latent level, linear mixed models are used for both the
location and scale parameters of the Gumbel distribution, accounting for
seasonal dependence and covariates from the catchments. The specification of
prior distributions makes use of penalised complexity (PC) priors, to ensure
robust inference for the latent parameters. The main idea behind the PC priors
is to shrink toward a base model, thus avoiding overfitting. PC priors also
provide a convenient framework for prior elicitation based on simple notions of
scale. Prior distributions for regression coefficients are also elicited based
on hydrological and meteorological knowledge. Posterior inference was done
using the MCMC split sampler, an efficient Gibbs blocking scheme tailored to
latent Gaussian models. The proposed model was applied to observed data from
eight river catchments in Iceland. A cross-validation study demonstrates good
predictive performance.

communication in which all involved processes communicate in small, identically
structured neighborhoods of other processes. Isomorphic neighborhoods are
defined via an embedding of the processes in a regularly structured topology,
e.g., $d$-dimensional torus, which may correspond to the physical communication
network of the underlying system. Isomorphic collective communication is useful
for implementing stencil and other regular, sparse distributed computations,
where the assumption that all processes behave (almost) symmetrically is
justified.
  In this paper, we show how efficient message-combining communication
schedules for isomorphic, sparse collective communication can easily and
efficiently be computed by purely local computations. We give schemes for
\emph{isomorphic \alltoall} and \emph{\allgather} communication that reduce the
number of communication rounds and thereby the communication latency from $s$
to at most $Nd$, for neighborhoods consisting of $s$ processes with the (small)
factor $N$ depending on the structure of the neighborhood and the capabilities
of the communication system. Using these schedules, we give \emph{zero-copy

datatypes to eliminate explicit, process-local copy operations. By benchmarking
the collective communication algorithms against straightforward implementations
and against the corresponding MPI neighborhood collectives, we document
significant latency improvements of our implementations for block sizes of up
to a few kilobytes. We discuss further optimizations for computing even better
schedules, some of which have been implemented and benchmarked.

surface can be manipulated by changing the remanent magnetization direction.
The effect is of the order of $\Delta$E = 100 meV and $\Delta \text {k} =

the bulk band structure. First-principles calculations and one-step
photoemission calculations suggest that the effect is related to changes in the
electronic ground state, rather than caused by the photoemission process
itself. The symmetry of the effect indicates that the observed electronic bulk
states are influenced by the presence of the surface, which might be understood
as related to a Rashba-type effect. By pinpointing the regions in the
electronic band structure where the switchable band gaps occur, we demonstrate
the significance of spin-orbit interaction even for elements as light as 3d
ferromagnets.

of the most important issues in the statistical physics of complex networks. A
paramount example is provided by financial networks. In fact, the spreading and
amplification of financial distress in capital markets is strongly affected by
the interconnections among financial institutions. Yet, while the aggregate
balance sheets of institutions are publicly disclosed, information on single
positions is mostly confidential and, as such, unavailable. Standard approaches
to reconstruct the network of financial interconnection produce unrealistically
dense topologies, leading to a biased estimation of systemic risk. Moreover,
reconstruction techniques are generally designed for monopartite networks of
bilateral exposures between financial institutions, thus failing in reproducing
bipartite networks of security holdings (\eg, investment portfolios). Here we
propose a reconstruction method based on constrained entropy maximization,
tailored for bipartite financial networks. Such a procedure enhances the
traditional {\em capital-asset pricing model} (CAPM) and allows to reproduce
the correct topology of the network. We test this ECAPM method on a dataset,
collected by the European Central Bank, of detailed security holdings of
European institutional sectors over a period of six years (2009-2015). Our
approach outperforms the traditional CAPM and the recently proposed MECAPM both
in reproducing the network topology and in estimating systemic risk due to
fire-sales spillovers. In general, ECAPM can be applied to the whole class of
weighted bipartite networks described by the fitness model.

studied by means of classical molecular dynamic simulations with an empirical
force-field as a function of temperature. The Fourier analysis of the
out-of-plane fluctuations often applied to characterize the acoustic bending
mode of graphene is extended to the optical branch, whose polarization vector
is perpendicular to the graphene layer. This observable is inaccessible in a
continuous elastic model of graphene but it is readily obtained by the
atomistic treatment. Our results suggest that the long-wavelength limit of the
acoustic out-of-plane fluctuations of a free layer without stress is
qualitatively similar to that predicted by a harmonic model under a tensile
stress. This conclusion is a consequence of the anharmonicity of both in-plane
and out-of-plane vibrational modes of the lattice. The most striking anharmonic
effect is the presence of a linear term, $\omega_{A}=v_{A}k$, in the dispersion
relation of the acoustic bending band of graphene at long wavelengths
($k\rightarrow0$). This term implies a strong reduction of the amplitude of
out-of-plane oscillations in comparison to a flexural mode with a
$k^{2}$-dependence in the long-wavelength limit. Our simulations show an
increase of the sound velocity associated to the bending mode, as well as an
increase of its bending constant, $\kappa,$ as the temperature increases.
Moreover, the frequency of the optical bending mode, $\omega_{O}(\Gamma)$, also
increases with the temperature. Our results are in agreement with recent
analytical studies of the bending modes of graphene using either perturbation
theory or an adiabatic approximation in the framework of continuous layer

labeled data. However, manually annotating data is a time-consuming task, which
thus makes few annotated resources available so far. Unlike audio event
detection, automatic audio tagging, a multi-label acoustic event classification
task, only relies on weakly labeled data. This is highly desirable to some
practical applications using audio analysis. In this paper we propose to use a
fully deep neural network (DNN) framework to handle the multi-label
classification task in a regression way. Considering that only chunk-level
rather than frame-level labels are available, the whole or almost whole frames
of the chunk were fed into the DNN to perform a multi-label regression for the
expected tags. The fully DNN, which is regarded as an encoding function, can
well map the audio features sequence to a multi-tag vector. A deep pyramid
structure was also designed to extract more robust high-level features related
to the target tags. Further improved methods were adopted, such as the Dropout
and background noise aware training, to enhance its generalization capability
for new audio recordings in mismatched environments. Compared with the
conventional Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) and support vector machine (SVM)
methods, the proposed fully DNN-based method could well utilize the long-term
temporal information with the whole chunk as the input. The results show that
our approach obtained a 15% relative improvement compared with the official
GMM-based method of DCASE 2016 challenge.

coherence peaks, the states in the continuum above the gap are unconventional,
and the boundary entropy is a non-monotonic function of temperature. Even more
surprisingly, we also find that the low-energy spectrum in the limit $\Delta\to
0$ actually does not correspond to the spectrum strictly at $\Delta=0$. In
particular, the $\Delta\to 0$ ground state is an orbitally degenerate
spin-singlet, while it is an orbital singlet with a residual spin degeneracy at
$\Delta=0$. In addition, there are fractionalized spin-1/2 sub-gap excitations

exploiting spin electronics (or spintronics) can be a key technology in this

functionality, non-volatile memory, can provide massive embedded memory in
unconventional circuits, thus escaping the von-Neumann bottleneck arising when
memory and processors are located separately. Other features of spintronic
devices that could be beneficial for bio-inspired computing include tunable

quantitative rectifiability in the first Heisenberg group $\mathbb{H}$. In
particular, we aim to demonstrate that new phenomena arise compared to the
Euclidean theory, founded by G. David and S. Semmes in the 90's. The theory in
$\mathbb{H}$ has an apparent connection to certain nonlinear PDEs, which do not
play a role with similar questions in $\mathbb{R}^{3}$.
  Our main object of study are the intrinsic Lipschitz graphs in $\mathbb{H}$,
introduced by B. Franchi, R. Serapioni and F. Serra Cassano in 2006. We claim
that these $3$-dimensional sets in $\mathbb{H}$, if any, deserve to be called
quantitatively $3$-rectifiable. Our main result is that the intrinsic Lipschitz
graphs satisfy a weak geometric lemma with respect to vertical $\beta$-numbers.
Conversely, extending a result of David and Semmes from $\mathbb{R}^{n}$, we
prove that a $3$-Ahlfors-David regular subset in $\mathbb{H}$, which satisfies
the weak geometric lemma and has big vertical projections, necessarily has big
pieces of intrinsic Lipschitz graphs.

uniaxial tensile stretching, under conditions of constant imposed stress and
force, by means of linear stability analysis and nonlinear simulations. We
demonstrate necking to be a flow instability that is an unavoidable consequence
of the constitutive behaviour of essentially any viscoelastic material. We
derive criteria for the onset of necking that can be reported in terms of
characteristic signatures in the shapes of the experimentally measured material
functions, and that should therefore apply universally to all materials. To
confirm their generality, we show them to hold numerically in six constitutive
models. Under conditions of constant stress, we find two distinct dynamical
regimes as a function of time. In the first regime the strain rate quickly
attains a value prescribed by the fluid's underlying homogeneous constitutive
curve, at the given stress. In this first regime, no appreciable necking
arises. A second regime then ensues in which the homogeneous flow destabilises
to form a neck. This necking instability can occur via two distinct modes. The
first mode is relatively gentle and arises in any regime where the slope of the
constitutive curve is positive. It has a rate of necking per accumulated strain
unit set by the inverse of the slope of the constitutive curve. The second mode
sets in when a carefully defined `elastic derivative' of the tensile force
first slopes down as a function of the time. We discuss the way in which these
modes of instability manifest themselves in entangled polymeric fluids,
demonstrating four distinct regimes of necking behaviour as a function of
stress. Under conditions of constant imposed force, typically the flow sweeps
up the underlying constitutive curve of the fluid in question, with instability
to necking in any regime where that curve is positively sloping.

development of methods to infer the latent attributes of users, which are
crucially useful for personalization, advertising and recommendation. However,
the current user profiling approaches have limited success, due to the lack of
a principled way to integrate different types of social relationships of a
user, and the reliance on scarcely-available labeled data in building a
prediction model. In this paper, we present a novel solution termed Collective
Semi-Supervised Learning (CSL), which provides a principled means to integrate
different types of social relationship and unlabeled data under a unified
computational framework. The joint learning from multiple relationships and
unlabeled data yields a computationally sound and accurate approach to model
user attributes in social media. Extensive experiments using Twitter data have
demonstrated the efficacy of our CSL approach in inferring user attributes such
as account type and marital status. We also show how CSL can be used to
determine important user features, and to make inference on a larger user

terms of evolutionary game theory, where each word to be disambiguated is
represented as a node on a graph whose edges represent word relations and
senses are represented as classes. The words simultaneously update their class
membership preferences according to the senses that neighboring words are
likely to choose. We use distributional information to weigh the influence that
each word has on the decisions of the others and semantic similarity
information to measure the strength of compatibility among the choices. With
this information we can formulate the word sense disambiguation problem as a
constraint satisfaction problem and solve it using tools derived from game
theory, maintaining the textual coherence. The model is based on two ideas:
similar words should be assigned to similar classes and the meaning of a word
does not depend on all the words in a text but just on some of them. The paper
provides an in-depth motivation of the idea of modeling the word sense
disambiguation problem in terms of game theory, which is illustrated by an
example. The conclusion presents an extensive analysis on the combination of
similarity measures to use in the framework and a comparison with

superposition states we show that the gap vanishes in the macroscopic limit.
This in turn shows that preparation of such states by simple cooling to the

Our approach is very general and can be used to rule out a variety of quantum

Moreover, our methods and results can be used for addressing quantum marginal

nano-machine into the environment can degrade in the channel via a first-order
degradation reaction and those that reach the receiver nano-machine can
participate in a reversible bimolecular reaction with receiver receptor
proteins. Thereby, we distinguish between two scenarios. In the first scenario,
we assume that the entire surface of the receiver is covered by receptor
molecules. We derive a closed-form analytical expression for the expected
received signal at the receiver, i.e., the expected number of activated
receptors on the surface of the receiver. Then, in the second scenario, we
consider the case where the number of receptor molecules is finite and the
uniformly distributed receptor molecules cover the receiver surface only
partially. We show that the expected received signal for this scenario can be
accurately approximated by the expected received signal for the first scenario
after appropriately modifying the forward reaction rate constant. The accuracy
of the derived analytical results is verified by Brownian motion particle-based
simulations of the considered environment, where we also show the impact of the

insight into the physics of mergers, through which large scale structures form
in the Universe. Velocity estimates within the intracluster medium (ICM) can be
obtained via the Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (SZ) effect, but its observation is
challenging both in term of sensitivity requirement and control of systematic
effects, including the removal of contaminants. In this paper we report
resolved observations, at 150 and 260 GHz, of the SZ effect toward the triple
merger MACS J0717.5+3745 (z=0.55), using data obtained with the NIKA camera at
the IRAM 30m telescope. Assuming that the SZ signal is the sum of a thermal
(tSZ) and a kinetic (kSZ) component and by combining the two NIKA bands, we
extract for the first time a resolved map of the kSZ signal in a cluster. The
kSZ signal is dominated by a dipolar structure that peaks at -5.1 and +3.4
sigma, corresponding to two subclusters moving respectively away and toward us
and coincident with the cold dense X-ray core and a hot region undergoing a
major merging event. We model the gas electron density and line-of-sight
velocity of MACS J0717.5+3745 as four subclusters. Combining NIKA data with
X-ray observations from XMM-Newton and Chandra, we fit this model to constrain
the gas line-of-sight velocity of each component, and we also derive, for the
first time, a velocity map from kSZ data (i.e. that is model-dependent). Our
results are consistent with previous constraints on the merger velocities, and
thanks to the high angular resolution of our data, we are able to resolve the
structure of the gas velocity. Finally, we investigate possible contamination
and systematic effects with a special care given to radio and submillimeter
galaxies. Among the sources that we detect with NIKA, we find one which is
likely to be a high redshift lensed submillimeter galaxy.

logical symbols from one computer to another, each computer must mesh its
phases with arrivals of symbols from other computers. Even the best atomic
clocks drift unforeseeably in frequency and phase; feedback steers them toward
aiming points that depend on a chosen wave function and on hypotheses about
signal propagation. A wave function, always under-determined by evidence,
requires a guess. Guessed wave functions are coded into computers that steer
atomic clocks in frequency and position---clocks that step computers through
their phases of computations, as well as clocks, some on space vehicles, that
supply evidence of the propagation of signals. Recognizing the dependence of
the phasing of symbol arrivals on guesses about signal propagation elevates
`logical synchronization.' from its practice in computer engineering to a
discipline essential to physics. Within this discipline we begin to explore
questions invisible under any concept of time that fails to acknowledge the
unforeseeable. In particular, variation of spacetime curvature is shown to
limit the bit rate of logical communication.

for given example stars, which indicates the feasibility to test whether the
spin direction is the same as the normal of the young stellar disk located at
the GC, and, further to provide insights into the assembly history of the MBH.
We demonstrate the quality of constraining the MBH spin that may be achieved,
given any set of the astrometric and the redshift precisions of observational

precisions with 1--30$\mu$as and 0.1--10 km/s, an improvement in astrometric
precision would be more effective at improving the quality of constraining the

derive some exact results for the growth rate of action within the
Wheeler-DeWitt (WDW) patch at late time approximation, which is supposed to be
dual to the growth rate of quantum complexity of holographic state. Based on
the results from the general $D$-dimensional Reissner-Nordstr\""{o}m (RN)-AdS
black hole, rotating/charged Ba\~{n}ados-Teitelboim-Zanelli (BTZ) black hole,
Kerr-AdS black hole and charged Gauss-Bonnet-AdS black hole, we present a
universal formula for the action growth expressed in terms of some
thermodynamical quantities associated with the outer and inner horizons of the
AdS black holes. And we leave the conjecture unchanged that the stationary AdS
black hole in Einstein gravity is the fastest computer in nature.

the arrow of time. New stimulants have been provided, thanks to unprecedented
degree of control reached in experiments with isolated quantum systems and
rapid theoretical developments of manybody localization in disordered
interacting systems. The proposal of (many-body) eigenstate thermalization (ET)
for these systems reinforces the common belief that either interaction or
extrinsic randomness is required for thermalization. Here, we unveil a quantum
thermalization mechanism challenging this belief. We find that, provided
one-body quantum chaos is present, as a pure many-body state evolves the arrow
of time can emerge, even without interaction or randomness. In times much
larger than the Ehrenfest time that signals the breakdown of quantum-classical
correspondence, quantum chaotic motion leads to thermal [Fermi-Dirac (FD) or
Bose-Einstein (BE)] distributions and thermodynamics in individual eigenstates.
Our findings lay dynamical foundation of statistical mechanics and
thermodynamics of isolated quantum systems.

presented. We have derived a polynomial expansion of $e^x$ by computing it as
an initial value problem using a symbolic programming language. This algorithm
is shown to be comparable in operation count and convergence with the
state--of--the--art method which is based on a Pade approximation of the
exponential matrix function. The present polynomial form, however, is more
reliable because the evaluation requires only linear combinations of the input
matrix. We also show that the technique used to solve the differential
equation, when implemented symbolically, leads to a rational as well as a
polynomial form of the solution function. The rational form is the well-known
diagonal Pade approximation of $e^x$. The polynomial form, after some
rearranging to minimize operation count, will be used to evaluate the
exponential of a matrix so as to illustrate its advantages as compared with the
Pade form.

advancements in healthcare technology and the Internet of Things (IoT), the
demand for ultra-dense, ultra-low-power memory is increasing. In this review,
we present a comprehensive perspective on the most notable approaches to the
fabrication of physically flexible memory devices. With the future goal of
replacing traditional mechanical hard disks with solid-state storage devices, a
fully flexible electronic system will need two basic devices: transistors and
nonvolatile memory. Transistors are used for logic operations and gating memory
arrays, while nonvolatile memory (NVM) devices are required for storing
information in the main memory and cache storage. Since the highest density of
transistors and storage structures is manifested in memories, the focus of this
review is flexible NVM. Flexible NVM components are discussed in terms of their
functionality, performance metrics, and reliability aspects, all of which are
critical components for NVM technology to be part of mainstream consumer
electronics, IoT, and advanced healthcare devices. Finally, flexible NVMs are
benchmarked and future prospects are provided.

with zero detuning are considered. In these states, atoms can not emit photons,
although they have non-zero energy. They are stable and can serve as a
controlled energy reservoir from which photons can be extracted by
differentiated effects on atoms, for example, their spatial separation. Dark
states are the simplest example of a subspace free of decoherence in the form
of a photon flight, and therefore are of interest for quantum computing. It is
proved that a) the dimension of the subspace of dark states of atoms is the
Catalan numbers, b) in the RWA approximation, any dark state is a linear
combination of tensor products of singlet-type states and the ground states of
individual atoms. For the exact model, in the case of the same force of
interaction of atoms with the field, the same decomposition is true, and only
singlets participate in the products and the dark states can neither emit a
photon nor absorb it. The proof is based on the method of quantization of the
amplitude of states of atomic ensembles, in which the roles of individual atoms
are interchangeable. In such an ensemble there is a possibility of
micro-causality: the trajectory of each quantum of amplitude can be uniquely
assigned.

synchronous perfect recall semantics in partially observed discrete-time Markov
chains. Decidability results are known for certain restricted logics with
respect to these semantics, subject to a variety of restrictions that are
either unexplained or involve a longstanding unsolved mathematical problem. We
show that mild generalizations of the known decidable cases suffice to render
the model checking problem definitively undecidable. In particular, for a
synchronous perfect recall, a generalization from temporal operators with
finite reach to operators with infinite reach renders model checking
undecidable. The case of the clock semantics is closely related to a monadic
second order logic of time and probability that is known to be decidable,
except on a set of measure zero. We show that two distinct extensions of this
logic make model checking undecidable. One of these involves polynomial
combinations of probability terms, the other involves monadic second order
quantification into the scope of probability operators. These results explain
some of the restrictions in previous work.
