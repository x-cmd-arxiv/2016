particular, we present the elite neighbor selection strategy to identify the
uncertain links by locally adaptive thresholds and build a sparse graph with a
small number of probably reliable links. We argue that a small number of
probably reliable links can lead to significantly better consensus results than
using all graph links regardless of their reliability. The random walk process
driven by a new transition probability matrix is utilized to explore the global

the sparse graph by analyzing the probability trajectories of the random
walkers, based on which two consensus functions are further proposed.
Experimental results on multiple real-world datasets demonstrate the

their unique combination of superb properties and processability. Predicting
bulk metallic glass formers from known parameters remains a challenge and the
search for new systems is still performed by trial and error. It has been
speculated that some sort of ""confusion"" during crystallization of the
crystalline phases competing with glass formation could play a key role. Here,
we propose a heuristic descriptor quantifying confusion and demonstrate its
validity by detailed experiments on two well-known glass forming alloy systems.
With the insight provided by these results, we develop a robust model for
predicting glass formation ability based on the spectral decomposition of
geometrical and energetic features of crystalline phases calculated ab-initio
in the AFLOW high throughput framework. Our findings indicate that the
formation of metallic glass phases could be a much more common phenomenon than
currently estimated, with more than 17% of binary alloy systems being potential
glass formers. Our approach is capable of pinpointing favorable compositions,
overcoming a major bottleneck hindering the discovery of new materials. Hence,
it is demonstrated that smart descriptors, based solely on the energetics and
structure of competing crystalline phases calculated from first-principles and

psychology: Characterized by short presentation times and speedy behavioral
responses, these tasks highlight the efficiency with which our visual system
processes natural object categories. Previous studies have shown that
feed-forward hierarchical models of the visual cortex provide a good fit to
human visual decisions. At the same time, recent work in computer vision has
demonstrated significant gains in object recognition accuracy with increasingly

  We have conducted a large-scale psychophysics study to assess the correlation

alone promote a highly degenerate pairing state, in which both $s$-wave and
$d$-wave symmetries are equally favored, and $T_{c}$ is consequently
suppressed. However, the presence of a sizable spin-orbit coupling or inversion
symmetry-breaking at the film interface lifts this harmful degeneracy and
selects the $s$-wave state, in agreement with recent experimental proposals.
The resulting gap function displays a weak anisotropy, which agrees with

the historical photometric database available in the literature since 1889.
This provides a time baseline of up to 118 years for these variables. The
analysis was performed using two independent approaches: first, the classical
$O-C$ behaviour of the time of maximum light, and second, via a grid
$(P,\beta)$, where the solution producing the minimum scatter in the phased
light curve is chosen. The results of the two methods agree satisfactorily.
This allowed a new interpretation of the nature of the period changes in many
RR Lyrae stars in M5. It is found that in $96\%$ of the stars studied no
irregular or stochastic variations need to be claimed, but that $66\%$ of the
population shows steady period increases or decreases, and that $34\%$ of the
periods seem to have been stable over the last century.
  The lack of systematic positive or negative period variations in RR Lyrae
stars in other globular clusters is addressed, and the paradigm of period
changes being a consequence of stellar evolution is discussed in terms of
chemical variations near the stellar core and of multiple stellar populations.
In M5 we found a small positive average value of $\beta$ and a small surplus of
RRab stars with a period increase. Nevertheless, in M5 we have been able to
isolate a group of likely evolved stars that systematically show positive, and
in some cases large, period change rates.

spin-glass transition temperature $T_f$, in the presence of random fields, are
investigated. To accomplish this task, the Sherrington-Kirkpatrick model is
studied through the replica formalism, within a one-step
replica-symmetry-breaking procedure. In addition, the dependence of the
Almeida-Thouless eigenvalue $\lambda_{\rm AT}$ (replicon) on the random fields
is analyzed. Particularly, in absence of random fields, the temperature $T_f$
can be traced by a divergence in the spin-glass susceptibility $\chi_{\rm SG}$,
which presents a term inversely proportional to the replicon $\lambda_{\rm
AT}$. As a result of a relation between $\chi_{\rm SG}$ and $\chi_3$, the
latter also presents a divergence at $T_f$, which comes as a direct consequence
of $\lambda_{\rm AT}=0$ at $T_f$. However, our results show that, in the
presence of random fields, $\chi_3$ presents a rounded maximum at a temperature
$T^{*}$, which does not coincide with the spin-glass transition temperature
$T_f$ (i.e., $T^* > T_f$ for a given applied random field). Thus, the maximum
value of $\chi_3$ at $T^*$ reflects the effects of the random fields in the
paramagnetic phase, instead of the non-trivial ergodicity breaking associated
with the spin-glass phase transition. It is also shown that $\chi_3$ still
maintains a dependence on the replicon $\lambda_{\rm AT}$, although in a more
complicated way, as compared with the case without random fields. These results
are discussed in view of recent observations in the LiHo$_x$Y$_{1-x}$F$_4$

sources amongst the symbiotic stars. The X-ray emission of AG Peg as observed
with ROSAT (1993 June) might well originate from colliding stellar winds (CSW)

functional properties. At the polar-centrosymmetric phase boundary in
bi-layered perovskite Ca3-xSrxTi2O7 with x~1, we found the presence of abundant
topological Z8 vortex-antivortex pairs, associated with four oxygen octahedral
tilts at domains and another four different oxygen octahedral tilts at domain
boundaries. Our discovery opens a new revenue to unveil topological defects
associated with various types of oxygen octahedral distortions.

mysterious. We describe a discrete Morse matching for a family of independence
complexes $\mathrm{Ind}(\Delta_n^m)$ that include these matching complexes.
Using this matching, we determine the dimensions of the chain spaces for the
resulting Morse complexes and derive bounds on the location of non-trivial
homology groups for certain $\mathrm{Ind}(\Delta_n^m)$. Further, we determine
the Euler characteristic of $\mathrm{Ind}(\Delta_n^m)$ and prove that several

example (QBE) or definability, take a set of user examples and convert them
into an explanatory CQ. Despite their importance, the complexity of these
problems is prohibitively high (coNEXPTIME-complete). We isolate their two main
sources of complexity and propose relaxations of them that reduce the
complexity while having meaningful theoretical interpretations. The first
relaxation is based on the idea of using existential pebble games for
approximating homomorphism tests. We show that this characterizes
QBE/definability for CQs up to treewidth $k$, while reducing the complexity to
EXPTIME. As a side result, we obtain that the complexity of the
QBE/definability problems for CQs of treewidth $k$ is EXPTIME-complete for each
$k \geq 1$. The second relaxation is based on the idea of ""desynchronizing""
direct products, which characterizes QBE/definability for unions of CQs and
reduces the complexity to coNP. The combination of these two relaxations yields
tractability for QBE and characterizes it in terms of unions of CQs of
treewidth at most $k$. We also study the complexity of these problems for
conjunctive regular path queries over graph databases, showing them to be no
more difficult than for CQs.

project uses Hubble Space Telescope imaging to study a representative sample of
six Andromeda dSph satellite companion galaxies. The main goal of the program
is to determine whether the star formation histories (SFHs) of the Andromeda
dSph satellites demonstrate significant statistical differences from those of
the Milky Way, which may be attributable to the different properties of their
local environments. Our observations reach the oldest main sequence turn-offs,
allowing a time resolution at the oldest ages of ~ 1 Gyr, which is comparable
to the best achievable resolution in the MW satellites. We find that the six
dSphs present a variety of SFHs that are not strictly correlated with
luminosity or present distance from M31. Specifically, we find a significant
range in quenching times (lookback times from 9 to 6 Gyr), but with all
quenching times more than ~ 6 Gyr ago. In agreement with observations of Milky
Way companions of similar mass, there is no evidence of complete quenching of
star formation by the cosmic UV background responsible for reionization, but
the possibility of a degree of quenching at reionization cannot be ruled out.
We do not find significant differences between the SFHs of the three members of
the vast, thin plane of satellites and the three off-plane dSphs. The primary
difference between the SFHs of the ISLAndS dSphs and Milky Way dSph companions
of similar luminosities and host distances is the absence of very late
quenching (< 5 Gyr ago) dSphs in the ISLAndS sample. Thus, models that can
reproduce satellite populations with and without late quenching satellites will
be of extreme interest.

has been studied in different contexts. Researchers attempt to understand the
collective behaviors of human movement with respect to the spatio-temporal
distribution in traffic dynamics, from which a gravitational scaling law
characterizing the relation between the traffic flow, population and distance
has been found. However, most studies focus on the integrated properties of
gravitational scaling, neglecting its dynamical evolution during different
hours of a day. Investigating the hourly traffic flow data of Beijing subway
network, based on the hop-count distance of passengers, we find that the
scaling exponent of the gravitational law is smaller in Beijing subway system
compared to that reported in Seoul subway system. This means that traffic
demand in Beijing is much stronger and less sensitive to the travel distance.
Furthermore, we analyzed the temporal evolution of the scaling exponents in
weekdays and weekends. Our findings may help to understand and improve the
traffic congestion control in different subway systems.

southern hemisphere. In this manuscript, we present deep ($\sigma$ $\lesssim$
15 $ \mu$Jy) radio observations ($\nu$ = 6 GHz; $\lambda$ = 5 cm) of these
regions, and report the detection of a total of 114 sources. Thirteen of these
sources are associated with known young stellar objects, nine in Barnard 59 and
four in Lupus 1. The properties of the radio emission (spectral index and, in
some cases, polarization) suggest a thermal origin for most young stellar
objects. Only for two sources (Sz~65 and Sz~67) are there indications for a
possible non-thermal origin; more observations will be needed to ascertain the
exact nature of the radio emission in these sources. The remaining radio
detections do not have counterparts at other wavelengths, and the number of
sources detected per unit solid angle is in agreement with extragalactic number
counts. This suggests that all radio sources not associated with known young
stellar objects are background extragalactic sources.

binary black-hole coalescence event detected by the Laser Interferometer
Gravitational-wave Observatory (LIGO) on September 14, 2015 [1]. Reference
presented parameter estimation [2] of the source using a 13-dimensional,
phenomenological precessing-spin model (precessing IMRPhenom) and a
11-dimensional nonprecessing effective-one-body (EOB) model calibrated to
numerical-relativity simulations, which forces spin alignment (nonprecessing
EOBNR). Here we present new results that include a 15-dimensional
precessing-spin waveform model (precessing EOBNR) developed within the EOB
formalism. We find good agreement with the parameters estimated previously [2],
and we quote updated component masses of $35^{+5}_{-3}\mathrm{M}_\odot$ and
$30^{+3}_{-4}\mathrm{M}_\odot$ (where errors correspond to 90% symmetric
credible intervals). We also present slightly tighter constraints on the
dimensionless spin magnitudes of the two black holes, with a primary spin
estimate $0.65$ and a secondary spin estimate $0.75$ at 90% probability.
Reference [2] estimated the systematic parameter-extraction errors due to
waveform-model uncertainty by combining the posterior probability densities of
precessing IMRPhenom and nonprecessing EOBNR. Here we find that the two
precessing-spin models are in closer agreement, suggesting that these
systematic errors are smaller than previously quoted.

the AIRGA algorithm is in solving a sequence of linear systems. These linear
systems do change only slightly from one iteration step to the next. Here we
focus on efficiently solving these systems by iterative methods and the choice
of an appropriate preconditioner. We propose the use of relevant iterative
algorithm and the Sparse Approximate Inverse (SPAI) preconditioner. A technique
to cheaply update the SPAI preconditioner in each iteration step of the model

conditions the AIRGA algorithm is stable with respect to the error introduced
by iterative methods. Our theory is illustrated by experiments. It is
demonstrated that SPAI preconditioned Conjugate Gradient (CG) works well for
model reduction of a one dimensional beam model with AIRGA algorithm. Moreover,
the computation time of preconditioner with update is on an average 2/3 rd of
the computation time of preconditioner without update. With average timings
running into hours for very large systems, such savings are substantial.

primordial density perturbations and affects the expansion history during
reheating. This encompasses the original curvaton model but also covers a
larger class of scenarios. We find that, compared to the single-field case,
lower values of the energy density at the end of inflation and of the reheating
temperature are preferred when an additional scalar field is introduced. For
instance, if inflation is driven by a quartic potential, which is one of the
most favoured models when a light scalar field is added, the upper bound
$T_{\mathrm{reh}}<5\times 10^{4}\,\mathrm{GeV}$ on the reheating temperature
$T_{\mathrm{reh}}$ is derived, and the implications of this value on
post-inflationary physics are discussed. The information gained about reheating
is also quantified and it is found that it remains modest in plateau inflation
(though still larger than in the single-field version of the model) but can
become substantial in quartic inflation. The role played by the vev of the
additional scalar field at the end of inflation is highlighted, and opens
interesting possibilities for exploring stochastic inflation effects that could
determine its distribution.

left with broken bonds reconstruct to minimize surface energy. In many cases,
the surface can exhibit chemical properties unique from the bulk. These
differences are important as they control reactions and mediate thin film
growth. This is particularly true for complex oxides where certain terminating
crystal planes are polar and have a net dipole moment. For polar terminations,
reconstruction of atoms on the surface is the central mechanism to avoid the so
called polar catastrophe. This adds to the complexity of the reconstruction
where charge polarization and stoichiometry govern the final surface in
addition to standard thermodynamic parameters such as temperature and partial
pressure. Here we present direct, in-situ determination of polar SrTiO3 (110)
surfaces at temperatures up to 900 C using cross-sectional aberration corrected
scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM). Under these conditions, we
observe the coexistence of various surface structures that change as a function
of temperature. As the specimen temperature is lowered, the reconstructed
surface evolves due to thermal mismatch with the substrate. Periodic defects,
similar to dislocations, are found in these surface structures and act to
relieve stress due to mismatch. Combining STEM observations and electron
spectroscopy with density functional theory, we find a combination of lattice
misfit and charge compensation for stabilization. Beyond the characterization
of these complex reconstructions, we have developed a general framework that
opens a new pathway to simultaneously investigate the surface and near surface
regions of single crystals as a function of environment.

$(x,y,z)$ of points satisfying $x+y+z=0$. Let $N=p^n=|\mathbb{F}_p^n|$. Green
proved an arithmetic triangle removal lemma which says that for every
$\epsilon>0$ and prime $p$, there is a $\delta>0$ such that if $X,Y,Z \subset
\mathbb{F}_p^n$ and the number of triangles in $X \times Y \times Z$ is at most
$\delta N^2$, then we can delete $\epsilon N$ elements from $X$, $Y$, and $Z$
and remove all triangles. Green posed the problem of improving the quantitative
bounds on the arithmetic triangle removal lemma, and, in particular, asked
whether a polynomial bound holds. Despite considerable attention, prior to this
paper, the best known bound, due to the first author, showed that $1/\delta$
can be taken to be an exponential tower of twos of height logarithmic in
$1/\epsilon$.
  We solve Green's problem, proving an essentially tight bound for Green's
arithmetic triangle removal lemma in $\mathbb{F}_p^n$. We show that a
polynomial bound holds, and further determine the best possible exponent.
Namely, there is a computable number $C_p$ such that we may take $\delta =
(\epsilon/3)^{C_p}$, and we must have $\delta \leq \epsilon^{C_p-o(1)}$. In
particular, $C_2=1+1/(5/3 - \log_2 3) \approx 13.239$, and $C_3=1+1/c_3$ with
$c_3=1-\frac{\log b}{\log 3}$, $b=a^{-2/3}+a^{1/3}+a^{4/3}$, and
$a=\frac{\sqrt{33}-1}{8}$, which gives $C_3 \approx 13.901$. The proof uses
Kleinberg, Sawin, and Speyer's essentially sharp bound on multicolored sum-free
sets, which builds on the recent breakthrough on the cap set problem by
Croot-Lev-Pach, and the subsequent work by Ellenberg-Gijswijt,

striking puzzle that FeSe displays nematic order (spontaneously broken lattice

proposals for its origin in terms of either the $3d$-electron's orbital degrees
of freedom or spin physics in the form of frustrated magnetism. Here we argue
that the phase diagram of FeSe under pressure could be qualitatively described
by a quantum spin model with highly frustrated interactions. We implement both
the site-factorized wave-function analysis and the large-scale density matrix
renormalization group (DMRG) in cylinders to study the spin-$1$

transitions from the well-known $(\pi,0)$ antiferromagnetic state to an exotic
$(\pi,0)$ antiferroquadrupolar order, either directly or through a
$(\pi/2,\pi)$ antiferromagnetic state. These many phases, while distinct, are
all nematic. We also discuss our theoretical ground-state phase diagram for the
understanding of the experimental low-temperature phase diagram obtained by the

on a plane in the 3D parameter space defined by their mass, size and second
moment of the velocity tensor. While these quantities cannot be directly
observed, there are suitable proxies: the luminosity Lk, half-light radius Re
and dispersion sigma_e. These proxies indeed lie on a very tight Fundamental
Plane (FP). How do the black holes in the centers of galaxies relate to the FP?
Their masses are known to exhibit no strong correlation with total galaxy mass,
but they do correlate weakly with bulge mass (when present), and extremely well
with the velocity dispersion through the Mbh = sigma_e^5.4 relation. These
facts together imply that a tight plane must also exist defined by black hole
mass, total galaxy mass and size. Here I show that this is indeed the case
using a heterogeneous set of 230 black holes. The sample includes BHs from zero
to 10 billion solar masses and host galaxies ranging from low surface
brightness dwarfs, through bulge-less disks, to brightest cluster galaxies. The
resulting BH-size-luminosity Mbh=(Lk/Re)^3.8 has the same amount of scatter as
the M-sigma relation and is aligned with the galaxy FP, such that it is just a
re-projection of sigma. The inferred BH-size-mass relation is
Mbh=(M_star/Re)^2.9. These relationships are universal and extend to galaxies
without bulges. This implies that the black hole is primarily correlated with
its global velocity dispersion and not with the properties of the bulge. I show
that the classical bulge--mass relation is a projection of the M-sigma
relation. When the velocity dispersion cannot be measured (at high-z or low
dispersions), the BH-size-mass relation should be used as a proxy for black
hole mass in favor of just galaxy or bulge mass.

in the debris disc of $\beta$ Pictoris. Our model proposes that atomic carbon
and oxygen are created from the photodissociation of CO, which is itself
released from volatile-rich bodies in the debris disc due to grain-grain
collisions or photodesorption. While the CO lasts less than one orbit, the
atomic gas evolves by viscous spreading resulting in an accretion disc inside
the parent belt and a decretion disc outside. The temperature, ionisation
fraction and population levels of carbon and oxygen are followed with the
photodissociation region model Cloudy, which is coupled to a dynamical viscous
$\alpha$ model. We present new gas observations of $\beta$ Pic, of C I observed
with APEX and O I observed with Herschel, and show that these along with
published C II and CO observations can all be explained with this new model.
Our model requires a viscosity $\alpha$ > 0.1, similar to that found in
sufficiently ionised discs of other astronomical objects; we propose that the
magnetorotational instability is at play in this highly ionised and dilute
medium. This new model can be tested from its predictions for high resolution
ALMA observations of C I. We also constrain the water content of the
planetesimals in $\beta$ Pic. The scenario proposed here might be at play in
all debris discs and this model could be used more generally on all discs with
C, O or CO detections.

isotropic phase space distribution function that accounts for annihilation and
reproduces the ""weak cusp"" found by Vasiliev for DM deep within the spike and
away from its boundaries. The DM density in the cusp varies as $r^{-1/2}$ for
$s$-wave annihilation, where $r$ is the distance from the central black hole,
and is not a flat ""plateau"" profile. We then extend this model by incorporating
a loss cone that accounts for the capture of DM particles by the hole. The loss
cone is implemented by a boundary condition that removes capture orbits,
resulting in an anisotropic distribution function. Finally, we evolve an
initial spike distribution function by integrating the Boltzmann equation to
show how the weak cusp grows and its density decreases with time. We treat two
cases, one for $s$-wave and the other for $p$-wave DM annihilation, adopting
parameters characteristic of the Milky Way nuclear core and typical WIMP models

of the equations. Solving first the equilibrium equations for S/N and S/F
bilayers and Josephson junctions, we study the superconducting proximity effect
in Dirac materials. Similarly to related works, we find that the effect of an
exchange field depends strongly on the direction of the field. Only components
normal to the transport direction lead to attenuation of the Cooper pair
wavefunction inside the F. Fields parallel to the transport direction lead to
phase-shifts in the dependence on the superconducting phase difference for both
the charge current and density of states in an S/F/S-junction. Moreover, we
compute the differential conductance in S/N and S/F bilayers with an applied
voltage bias, and determine the dependence on the length of the N and F regions
and the exchange field.

outside the fiber, with an overlap of 2. To build the sample, we cross-matched

to study the properties of AGN in galaxy mergers without the biases introduced
by morphological merger selection techniques. In this paper (Paper I), we use
our sample to assess the kinematics of AGN photoionized gas in galaxy mergers.
We find that spectroscopic offset AGN selection may be up to 89% incomplete due

velocity offsets are generally larger than expected if our spatial selection
introduces a bias toward face-on orbits, suggesting the presence of complex
kinematics in the emission line gas of AGN in galaxy mergers.

behavior of agents interacting via a scale-free connection topology, is a
central problem in many scientific and engineering fields. For the linear
version of this problem, the so-called controllability Gramian has played an
important role to quantify how effectively the dynamical states are reachable
by a suitable driving input. In this paper, we first extend the notion of the
controllability Gramian to nonlinear dynamics in terms of the Gibbs
distribution. Next, we show that, when the networks are open to environmental
noise, the newly defined Gramian is equal to the covariance matrix associated
with randomly excited, but uncontrolled, dynamical state trajectories. This
fact theoretically justifies a simple Monte Carlo simulation that can extract
effectively controllable subdynamics in nonlinear complex networks. In
addition, the result provides a novel insight into the relationship between
controllability and statistical mechanics.

heavy neutrinos, as well as collider probes via the coupling to the Higgs.

star-forming galaxies, as well as the gas-phase metallicity indicators $O_{23}$

[OIII]/H$\beta$ ratios by median-stacking rest-frame optical spectra for a
sample of star-forming galaxies in the 3D-HST survey in the redshift range
$z\sim1.4-2.2$. Using $N = 4220$ star-forming galaxies, we stack the data in
bins of mass and specific star formation rates (sSFR) respectively. After
accounting for stellar Balmer absorption, we measure
[OIII]$\lambda5007$\AA/H$\beta$ down to $\mathrm{M} \sim 10^{9.2} \
\mathrm{M_\odot}$ and sSFR $\sim 10^{-9.6} \ \mathrm{yr}^{-1}$, more than an
order of magnitude lower than previous work at similar redshifts. We find an
offset of $0.59\pm0.05$ dex between the median ratios at $z\sim2$ and $z\sim0$
at fixed stellar mass, in agreement with existing studies. However, with
respect to sSFR, the $z \sim 2$ stacks all lie within 1$\sigma$ of the median
SDSS ratios, with an average offset of only $-0.06\pm 0.05$. We find that the
excitation properties of galaxies are tightly correlated with their sSFR at

realized reward and the reward of the best fixed action in hindsight. Using
results from infinite dimensional convex analysis, we generalize the method of
Dual Averaging (or Follow the Regularized Leader) to our setting and obtain
general upper bounds on the worst-case regret that subsume a wide range of
results from the literature. Under the assumption of uniformly continuous
rewards, we obtain explicit anytime regret bounds in a setting where the
decision set is the set of probability distributions on a compact metric space
$S$ whose Radon-Nikodym derivatives are elements of $L^p(S)$ for some $p > 1$.
Importantly, we make no convexity assumptions on either the set $S$ or the
reward functions. We also prove a general lower bound on the worst-case regret
for any online algorithm. We then apply these results to the problem of
learning in repeated continuous two-player zero-sum games, in which players'
strategy sets are compact metric spaces. In doing so, we first prove that if
both players play a Hannan-consistent strategy, then with probability 1 the
empirical distributions of play weakly converge to the set of Nash equilibria
of the game. We then show that, under mild assumptions, Dual Averaging on the

Hannan-consistency. Finally, we illustrate our results through numerical

in full general relativity, accounting for all the spin-weighted quadrupolar
modes, and separately accounting for all the quadrupolar and octopolar modes.
Consistent with the posterior distributions reported in LVC_PE[1] (at 90%
confidence), we find the data are compatible with a wide range of nonprecessing
and precessing simulations. Followup simulations performed using
previously-estimated binary parameters most resemble the data. Comparisons
including only the quadrupolar modes constrain the total redshifted mass Mz \in
[64 - 82M_\odot], mass ratio q = m2/m1 \in [0.6,1], and effective aligned spin
\chi_eff \in [-0.3, 0.2], where \chi_{eff} = (S1/m1 + S2/m2) \cdot\hat{L} /M.
Including both quadrupolar and octopolar modes, we find the mass ratio is even
more tightly constrained. Simulations with extreme mass ratios and effective
spins are highly inconsistent with the data, at any mass. Several nonprecessing
and precessing simulations with similar mass ratio and \chi_{eff} are
consistent with the data. Though correlated, the components' spins (both in
magnitude and directions) are not significantly constrained by the data. For
nonprecessing binaries, interpolating between simulations, we reconstruct a
posterior distribution consistent with previous results. The final black hole's
redshifted mass is consistent with Mf,z between 64.0 - 73.5M_\odot and the
final black hole's dimensionless spin parameter is consistent with af = 0.62 -
0.73. As our approach invokes no intermediate approximations to general
relativity and can strongly reject binaries whose radiation is inconsistent
with the data, our analysis provides a valuable complement to LVC_PE[1].

observations in five supernova remnants interacting with molecular clouds
(G1.4$-$0.1, IC443, W44, W51C, and G5.7$-$0.0). The observations show a clumpy
gas density distribution, and in most cases the narrow line widths of
$\sim3-4$\,km\,s$^{-1}$ are suggestive of maser emission. Very Large Array
observations reveal 36~GHz and/or 44~GHz CH$_3$OH, maser emission in a majority
(72\%) of the NH$_3$, peak positions towards three of these SNRs. This good
positional correlation is in agreement with the high densities required for the
excitation of each line. Through these observations we have shown that
CH$_3$OH, and NH$_3$, maser emission can be used as indicators of high density
clumps of gas shocked by supernova remnants, and provide density estimates
thereof. Modeling of the optical depth of the NH$_3$(3,3) emission is compared
to that of CH$_3$OH, constraining the densities of the clumps to a typical
density of the order of $10^5$~cm$^{-3}$ for cospatial masers. Regions of gas
with this density are found to exist in the post-shocked gas quite close to the
SNR shock front, and may be associated with sites where cosmic rays produce
gamma-ray emission via neutral pion decay.

Gaussian Process-based K2SC code to correct for the K2 pointing systematics and
simultaneously model stellar variability. The systematics-corrected,
variability-detrended light curves are searched for transits with the Box Least
Squares method, and a period-dependent detection threshold is used to generate
a preliminary candidate list. Two or three individuals vet each candidate
manually to produce the final candidate list, using a set of
automatically-generated transit fits and assorted diagnostic tests to inform
the vetting. We detect 147 single-planet system candidates and 5 multi-planet
systems, independently recovering the previously-published hot~Jupiters EPIC
212110888b, WASP-55b (EPIC 212300977b) and Qatar-2b (EPIC 212756297b). We also
report the outcome of reconnaissance spectroscopy carried out for all
candidates with Kepler magnitude Kp < 13, identifying 12 targets as likely
false positives. We compare our results to those of other K2 transit search

the large impact parameter scattering scales with energy and impact parameter

angular conservation laws, despite being based on time dependent Hamiltonians.
Many of the scattering amplitudes have a Feynman diagram like structure: local
interaction vertices connected by propagation of free particles (really
Sterman-Weinberg jets of particles). However, there are also amplitudes where
jets collide to form large meta-stable objects, with all the scaling properties
of black holes: energy, entropy and temperature, as well as the characteristic
time scale for the decay of perturbations. We generalize the conjecture of
Sekino and Susskind, to claim that all of these models are fast scramblers. The
rationale for this claim is that the interactions are invariant under fuzzy
subgroups of the group of volume preserving diffeomorphisms, so that they are
highly non-local on the holographic screen. We review how this formalism

LSTM), which maps from raw dialog history directly to a distribution over
system actions. The LSTM automatically infers a representation of dialog
history, which relieves the system developer of much of the manual feature
engineering of dialog state. In addition, the developer can provide software
that expresses business rules and provides access to programmatic APIs,
enabling the LSTM to take actions in the real world on behalf of the user. The
LSTM can be optimized using supervised learning (SL), where a domain expert
provides example dialogs which the LSTM should imitate; or using reinforcement
learning (RL), where the system improves by interacting directly with end
users. Experiments show that SL and RL are complementary: SL alone can derive a
reasonable initial policy from a small number of training dialogs; and starting
RL optimization with a policy trained with SL substantially accelerates the
learning rate of RL.

observed by PAMELA and AMS-02, in terms of dark matter (DM) decays or
annihilations. However, the recent progress in cosmic gamma-ray studies
challenges these attempts. Indeed, as we show, any rational DM model explaining
the positron anomaly abundantly produces final state radiation and Inverse
Compton gamma rays, which inevitably leads to a contradiction with Fermi-LAT
isotropic diffuse gamma-ray background measurements. Furthermore, the Fermi-LAT
observation of Milky Way dwarf satellites, supposed to be rich in DM, revealed
no significant signal in gamma rays. We propose a generic approach in which the
major contribution to cosmic rays comes from the dark matter disc and prove
that the tension between the DM origin of the positron anomaly and the cosmic

and drivability. To recognize driving styles of path-tracking behaviors for
different divers, a statistical pattern-recognition method is developed to deal
with the uncertainty of driving styles or characteristics based on probability
density estimation. First, to describe driver path-tracking styles, vehicle
speed and throttle opening are selected as the discriminative parameters, and a
conditional kernel density function of vehicle speed and throttle opening is
built, respectively, to describe the uncertainty and probability of two
representative driving styles, e.g., aggressive and normal. Meanwhile, a
posterior probability of each element in feature vector is obtained using full
Bayesian theory. Second, a Euclidean distance method is involved to decide to
which class the driver should be subject instead of calculating the complex
covariance between every two elements of feature vectors. By comparing the
Euclidean distance between every elements in feature vector, driving styles are
classified into seven levels ranging from low normal to high aggressive.
Subsequently, to show benefits of the proposed pattern-recognition method, a
cross-validated method is used, compared with a fuzzy logic-based
pattern-recognition method. The experiment results show that the proposed
statistical pattern-recognition method for driving styles based on kernel
density estimation is more efficient and stable than the fuzzy logic-based
method.

three-dimensional physical environments, such as urban areas or mountainous

the fact that many real systems can be modeled using these types of structures.
However, it is well known that the behavior of a system not only depends on
itself, but usually also depends on the dynamics of other structures. For this
reason, interacting complex networks and the processes developed on them have
been the focus of study of many researches in the last years. One of the most
studied subjects in this type of structures is the Synchronization problem,
which is important in a wide variety of processes in real systems. In this
manuscript we study the synchronization of two interacting scale-free networks,
in which each node has $ke$ dependency links with different nodes in the other
network. We map the synchronization problem with an interface growth, by
studying the fluctuations in the steady state of a scalar field defined in both
networks.
  We find that as $ke$ slightly increases from $ke=0$, there is a really
significant decreasing in the fluctuations of the system. However, this
considerable improvement takes place mainly for small values of $ke$, when the
interaction between networks becomes stronger there is only a slight change in
the fluctuations. We characterize how the dispersion of the scalar field
depends on the internal degree, and we show that a combination between the
decreasing of this dispersion and the integer nature of our growth model are
the responsible for the behavior of the fluctuations with $ke$.

searches with current or planned radio telescopes we find that the effective
area for detection of cosmic rays is substantial (~3*10^7 km^2), but the
acceptance angle is so small that the typical geometric aperture (~10^3 km^2
sr) is less than that of existing terrestrial detectors, and cosmic rays also
cannot be detected below an extremely high threshold energy (~10^23 eV). The
geometric aperture for neutrinos is slightly larger, and greater sensitivity
can be achieved with a radio detector on a Jupiter-orbiting satellite, but in
neither case is this sufficient to constitute a practical detection technique.
Exploitation of the large surface area of Jupiter for detecting
ultra-high-energy particles remains a long-term prospect that will require a
different technique, such as orbital fluorescence detection.

training data (corresponding pairs of low and high resolution images) we can
learn set of filters (i.e. a mapping) that when applied to given image that is

improving the visual quality of a blurry image by amplifying the underlying
details (a wide range of frequencies). Our approach additionally includes an
extremely efficient way to produce an image that is significantly sharper than
the input blurry one, without introducing artifacts such as halos and noise
amplification. We illustrate how this effective sharpening algorithm, in

to induce the learning of more effective upscaling filters with built-in

microscopic level remains debated, especially near the threshold forcing where
it stops. Here we study experimentally the collective dynamics of the moving
particles, using a set-up where the system spontaneously evolves toward the
erosion onset. We find that the spatial organization of the erosion flux is
heterogeneous in space, and occurs along channels of local flux $\sigma$ whose
distribution displays scaling near threshold and follows $P(\sigma)\sim
J/\sigma$, where $J$ is the mean erosion flux. Channels are strongly correlated
in the direction of forcing but not in the transverse direction. We show that
these results quantitatively agree with a model where the dynamics is governed
by the competition of disorder (which channels mobile particles) and particle
interactions (which reduces channeling). These observations support that for
laminar flows, erosion is a dynamical phase transition which shares similarity
with the plastic depinning transition occurring in dirty superconductors. The
methodology we introduce here could be applied to probe these systems as well.

confirming its redshift as z=7.154, and we detect Lyman-alpha in EGS-zs8-2 at
z=7.477, verifying a tentative detection presented in an earlier study. The
ubiquity of Lyman-alpha in this sample is puzzling given that the IGM is likely
significantly neutral over 7<z<9. To investigate this result in more detail, we
have initiated a campaign to target UV metal emission in the four Lyman-alpha
emitters as a probe of both the radiation field and the velocity offset of
Lyman-alpha. Here we present the detection of intense CIII] emission in
EGS-zs8-1, a galaxy from this sample previously shown to have Lyman-alpha at
z=7.73. Photoionization models indicate that an intense radiation field and low
metallicity are required to reproduce the intense CIII] and optical line
emission. We argue that this extreme radiation field is likely to affect the
local environment, increasing the transmission of Lyman-alpha through the
galaxy. Moreover, the centroid of CIII] indicates that Lyman-alpha is
redshifted from the systemic value by 340 km/s. This velocity offset is larger
than that seen in less luminous systems, providing an additional explanation
for the transmission of Lyman-alpha emission through the IGM. Since the
transmission is further enhanced by the likelihood that such systems are also
situated in the densest regions with the largest ionized bubbles, the
visibility of Lyman-alpha at z>7 is expected to be strongly
luminosity-dependent, with the most effective transmission occurring in systems
with intense star formation.

the evolution of vacancy microstructure in polycrystalline tungsten under
neutron bombardment. The evolution was followed up to 1.0 displacement per atom
(dpa) with point defects generated in accordance with a primary knock-on atom
(PKA) spectrum corresponding to 14-MeV neutrons. The present study includes the
effect of grain size (2.0 and 4.0 $\mu$m) but excludes the impact of
transmutation or pre-existing defects beyond grain boundary sinks. Vacancy
cluster density increases with dose rate, while the density of vacancies
decreases. Consequently, the average vacancy cluster size and the fraction of
vacancies in visible clusters decrease with increasing dose rate. The density
of vacancies and vacancy clusters decrease with grain size such that the
average size of the clusters remains similar. However, the average size is
larger for larger grains at dose rates < 4.5 x 10-7 dpa/s. The trend of vacancy
accumulation as a function of dose, dose rate, and grain size is similar to
that obtained with the High Flux Isotope Reactor (HFIR) PKA spectrum. However,
the amount of vacancy accumulation and the vacancy microstructure are quite
different. Compared to the HFIR case, we find that even though the dose rates
are 2.5 times higher, the density of vacancies and the average vacancy cluster
sizes are lower. In addition, a void lattice forms only for the lowest two dose
rates (4.5 x 10-8 and 4.5 x 10-9 dpa/s). In contrast, a void lattice formed at
all dose rates studied using the HFIR PKA spectrum. We discuss in detail the
factors that lead to these different microstructures.

Additionally, we present the detection of a compact molecular cloud located
adjacent to N3 in projection. CH3CN, CH3OH, CS, HC3N, HNCO, SiO, SO, and NH3
are detected in the cloud and most transitions have FWHM line widths of ~20

young supernova, active star, AGN, and micro-quasar hypotheses for N3. While a
micro-blazar may provide a viable explanation for N3, additional observations

exploring a nearby star, its attendant planetary system, and the intervening
interstellar medium. Based on this preliminary analysis, we estimate that the
minimum total Icarus scientific payload mass (i.e. the mass of probes and
instruments which must be decelerated to rest in the target system to enable a
meaningful programme of scientific investigation) will be in the region of 100
tonnes. Of this, approximately 10 tonnes would be allocated for cruise-phase
science instruments, and about 35 tonnes (i.e. the average of estimated lower
and upper limits of 28 and 41 tonnes) would be contributed by the intra-system
science payload itself (i.e. the dry mass of the stellar and planetary probes
and their instruments). The remaining ~55 tonnes is allocated for the sub-probe
intra-system propulsion requirements (crudely estimated from current Solar
System missions; detailed modelling of sub-probe propulsion systems will be
needed to refine this figure). The overall mass contributed by the science
payload to the total that must be decelerated from the interstellar cruise
velocity will be considerably more than 100 tonnes, however, as allowance must
be made for the payload structural and infrastructural elements required to
support, deploy, and communicate with the science probes and instruments. Based
on the earlier Daedalus study, we estimate another factor of two to allow for
these components. Pending the outcome of more detailed studies, it therefore
appears that an overall science-related payload mass of ~200 tonnes will be
required. This paper is a submission of the Project Icarus Study Group.

exploitation of the cross-correlation between the array observation data and
the output of the beamformer. Firstly, we construct a general linear equation
considered in large dimensions whose solution yields the steering vector
mismatch. Then, we employ the idea of the full orthogonalization method (FOM),
an orthogonal Krylov subspace based method, to iteratively estimate the
steering vector mismatch in a reduced-dimensional subspace, resulting in the
proposed orthogonal Krylov subspace projection mismatch estimation (OKSPME)
method. We also devise adaptive algorithms based on stochastic gradient (SG)
and conjugate gradient (CG) techniques to update the beamforming weights with
low complexity and avoid any costly matrix inversion. The main advantages of
the proposed low-rank and mismatch estimation techniques are their
cost-effectiveness when dealing with high dimension subspaces or large sensor
arrays. Simulations results show excellent performance in terms of the output
signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) of the beamformer among all the

high peaks (with height $\kappa$ >3.5 $\sigma_\kappa$, where $\sigma_\kappa$ is

addition, halos responsible for forming low peaks are found to be significantly
offset from the line-of-sight towards the peak center (impact parameter >~
their virial radii), compared with ~0.25 virial radii for halos linked with
high peaks, hinting that low peaks are more immune to baryonic processes whose
impact is confined to the inner regions of the dark matter halos. Our findings

Specifically, the ($\bar{\rm p},\ \mu^-$,\ p) system is considered, where
$\bar{p}$ is an antiproton, $\mu^-$ is a muon and p is a proton. A numerical
computation in the framework of a detailed few-body approach is carried out for
the following protonium (antiprotonic hydrogen) formation three-body reaction:
$\bar{p} + H_{\mu}(1s) \rightarrow (\bar{p} p)_{\alpha} + \mu^-$. Here,
$H_{\mu}(1s)$ is a ground state muonic hydrogen, i.e. a bound state of p and
$\mu^-$. A bound state of $p$ and its counterpart $\bar{p}$ is a protonium atom
in a quantum atomic state $\alpha$, i.e. $Pn = (\bar{p}p)_{\alpha}$. The
low-energy cross sections and rates of the $Pn$ formation reaction are computed
in the framework of a Faddeev-like equation. The strong $\bar{\rm p}$-p
interaction is included in these calculations within a first order
approximation. It was found, that even in the framework of this approximation
the inclusion of the strong interaction results in a quite significant
correction to the rate of the three-body reaction. Therefore, the title
three-body antiprotonic process with participation of muons should be useful,

study electron collisions with neutral beryllium over an energy range from
threshold to 100 eV. Coupling to the target continuum significantly affects the
results for transitions from the ground state, but to a lesser extent the
strong transitions between excited states. Cross sections are presented for
selected transitions between low-lying physical bound states of beryllium, as
well as for elastic scattering, momentum transfer, and ionization. The present
cross sections for transitions from the ground state from the two methods are
in excellent agreement with each other, and also with other available results
based on nonperturbative convergent pseudo-state and time-dependent
close-coupling models. The elastic cross section at low energies is dominated
by a prominent shape resonance. The ionization from the $(2s2p)^3P$ and
$(2s2p)^1P$ states strongly depends on the respective term. The current
predictions represent an extensive set of electron scattering data for neutral
beryllium, which should be sufficient for most modeling applications.

proposed in the literature. The stationary points of these envelope functions
have a close relationship with the solutions of the possibly nonsmooth

convex under some additional assumptions. Therefore, these envelope functions
create powerful bridges between nonsmooth and smooth optimization.
  In this paper, we present a general envelope function that unifies and
generalizes these envelope functions. We provide properties of the general
envelope function that sharpen corresponding known results for the special
cases. We also present an envelope function for the generalized alternating

between the spins, is used for a theoretical investigation of the transient
nutations induced by a strong oscillating field but disturbed by these local
dipolar fields. An effective Hamiltonian valid at the time scale of the
nutations is first established. An analytical expression for the Dipolar
Coherence time tDC is derived by adapting Van Vleck's perturbative approach to
the present situation, with weak rather than intermediate dipolar coupling. It
is found that the dipolar coupling does not affect tDC at exact ESR resonance
(Delta=0), a result reminiscent of a behaviour found in transient NMR in
liquids, in an inhomogeneous static field. The expression for tDC also presents
a qualitative similarity with a time introduced in that liquid-state NMR
context. Introducing a collection of independent clusters, a bridge is built
between tDC and the half-width delta of the usual steady state unsaturated ESR
line. Assuming a simple cubic lattice, numerical values for (tDC)Delta=delta
are given, for both undiluted and dilute samples. It is shown that the TN do
not obey the Bloch equations. Precautions to be taken when trying a qualitative
comparison between the present results and existing experimental data, and some
thermodynamic aspects, are discussed.

produce charmed mesons and charmed strange mesons. We use the cross sections
for charmonium dissociation in collisions with pion, rho meson, kaon, vector
kaon, and eta meson to calculate dissociation rates of charmonium with the five
types of mesons. Because of the temperature dependence of the meson masses,
dissociation cross sections, and meson distribution functions, the charmonium
dissociation rates generally increase with the increase of temperature and
decrease with the increase of charmonium momentum from 2.2 GeV/c. We find that
the first derivative of the dissociation rate with respect to the charmonium
momentum is zero when the charmonium is at rest. While the eta + psi' and eta +
chi_c dissociation reactions can be neglected, the J/psi, psi', and chi_c
dissociation are caused by the collisions with pion, rho meson, kaon, vector

analysis to show that a quasi-polarized endomorphism is always polarized, and
the polarized property descends via any equivariant dominant rational map.
Next, we show that a suitable maximal rationally connected fibration (MRC) can
be made $f$-equivariant using a construction of N. Nakayama, that $f$ descends
to a polarized endomorphism of the base Y of this MRC and that this Y is a
Q-abelian variety (quasi-\'etale quotient of an abelian variety). Finally, we
show that we can run the minimal model program (MMP) $f$-equivariantly for
mildly singular X and reach either a Q-abelian variety or a Fano variety of
Picard number one.
  As a consequence, the building blocks of polarized endomorphisms are those of
Q-abelian varieties and those of Fano varieties of Picard number one.
  Along the way, we show that $f$ always descends to a polarized endomorphism
of the Albanese variety Alb(X) of X, and that the pullback of a power of $f$
acts as a scalar multiplication on the Neron-Severi group of X (modulo torsion)
when X is smooth and rationally connected.
  Partial answers about X being of Calabi-Yau type, or Fano type are also given
with an extra primitivity assumption on $f$ which seems necessary by an
example.

uncertain almost half a century after their discovery. The two main competing
mechanisms are the extensively studied internal shocks and the less studied
magnetic reconnection. Here we consider GRB emission from magnetic reconnection
accounting for the relativistic bulk motions that it produces in the jet's bulk
rest frame. Far from the source the magnetic field is almost exactly normal to
the radial direction, suggesting locally quasi-spherical thin reconnection
layers between regions of oppositely directed magnetic field. We show that if
the relativistic motions in the jet's frame are confined to such a
quasi-spherical uniform layer, then the resulting GRB lightcurves are
independent of their direction distribution within this layer. This renders
previous results for a delta-function velocity-direction distribution
(Beniamini & Granot 2016) applicable to a much more general class of
reconnection models, which are suggested by numerical simulations. Such models
that vary in their velocity-direction distribution differ mainly in the size of
the bright region that contributes most of the observed flux at a given
emission radius or observed time. The more sharply peaked this distribution,
the smaller this bright region, and the stronger the lightcurve variability
that may be induced by deviations from a uniform emission over the thin
reconnection layer, which may be expected in a realistic GRB outflow. This is
reflected both in the observed image at a given observed time and in the
observer-frame emissivity map at a given emission radius, which are calculated
here for three simple velocity-direction distributions.

function for the sub-ensemble of closed molecules is computed by imposing chain
ends boundary conditions both on the radial fluctuations and on the angular

highly sensitive to the stacking potential, mostly to its nonlinear parameters.
We find that the J-factor generally decreases by reducing the sequence length (
N ) and, more significantly, below N = 100 base pairs. However, even for very
small molecules, the J-factors remain sizeable in line with recent experimental
indications. Large bending angles between adjacent base pairs and anharmonic

symbolic music data. We introduce a representation which reduces polyphonic
music to a univariate categorical sequence. In this way, we are able to apply
state of the art natural language processing techniques, namely the long
short-term memory sequence model. The representation we employ permits
arbitrary rhythmic structure, which we assume to be given. We show that our
model is effective on four out of four piano roll based benchmark datasets. We
further improve our model by augmenting our training data set with
transpositions of the original pieces through all musical keys, thereby
convincingly advancing the state of the art on these benchmark problems. We
also fit models to music which is unconstrained in its rhythmic structure,
discuss the properties of this model, and provide musical samples which are
more sophisticated than previously possible with this class of recurrent neural
network sequence models. We also provide our newly preprocessed data set of non
piano-roll music data.

scalar-tensor gravity, coupled with a Stueckelberg field. For a generic
background metric, this action is found to be not invariant, under both
diffeomorphism and generalized Weyl symmetry, the latter being a combination of
gauge and Weyl transformations. Interestingly, the quadratic Lagrangian,
emerging from a background of Minkowski metric, respects both the
transformations, independently. Becchi-Rouet-Stora-Tyutin (BRST) symmetry of
scalar-tensor gravity coupled with a Stueckelberg-like massive gauge particle,
possessing diffeomorphism and generalized Weyl symmetry, reveals that in both
the cases, negative norm states with unphysical degrees of freedom do exist. We
then show that, by combining diffeomorphism and generalized Weyl symmetries,
all the ghost states decouple, thereby removing the unphysical redundancies of
the theory. During this process, the scalar field does not represent any
dynamic mode, yet modifies the usual harmonic gauge condition through
non-minimal coupling with gravity.

subset of products to offer to consumers in order to maximise revenue. A simple
and natural strategy is to select the best assortment out of all those that are
constructed by fixing a threshold revenue $\pi$ and then choosing all products
with revenue at least $\pi$. This is known as the revenue-ordered assortments
strategy. In this paper we study the approximation guarantees provided by
revenue-ordered assortments when customers are rational in the following sense:
the probability of selecting a specific product from the set being offered
cannot increase if the set is enlarged. This rationality assumption, known as
regularity, is satisfied by almost all discrete choice models considered in the
revenue management and choice theory literature, and in particular by random
utility models. The bounds we obtain are tight and improve on recent results in
that direction, such as for the Mixed Multinomial Logit model by
Rusmevichientong et al. (2014). An appealing feature of our analysis is its
simplicity, as it relies only on the regularity condition.
  We also draw a connection between assortment optimisation and two pricing
problems called unit demand envy-free pricing and Stackelberg minimum spanning
tree: These problems can be restated as assortment problems under discrete
choice models satisfying the regularity condition, and moreover revenue-ordered
assortments correspond then to the well-studied uniform pricing heuristic. When
specialised to that setting, the general bounds we establish for
revenue-ordered assortments match and unify the best known results on uniform
pricing.

spiral arm is well detached from the galactic main body. We found that this arm
contains a large (~300 pc in size) Red Ellipse, named according to a strong
contamination of the H-alpha emission line on its optical images. The ellipse
is accompanied by a short parallel arc and a few others still smaller and less
regular; a bright star cluster is seen inside these features. The complicated
combination of arcs seems to be unique, it is only a bit similar to some SNRs.
However, the long-slit spectral data obtained with the Russian 6-m telescope
did not confirm the origin of the nebula as a result of a single SN outburst.
The emission-line spectrum corresponds to the photoionization by young hot
stars with a small contribution of shock ionization. The most likely
explanation of the Red Ellipse is a superbbuble created by a collective
feedback of massive stars in the star cluster located in the NE side of the Red
Ellipse. However, the very regular elliptical shape of the nebulae seems
strange.

first deduced on general grounds using two exact results, over the full range
of model parameters and including metallic, Mott, Kondo and band insulator
phases.The effective low-energy model which describes the PAM in the vicinity
of a Mott transition is then shown to be a one-band Hubbard model, with
effective hoppings that are not in general solely nearest neighbour, but decay
exponentially with distance. This mapping is shown to have a range of
implications for the physics of the problem, from phase boundaries to
single-particle dynamics; all of which are confirmed and supplemented by NRG
calculations. Finally we consider the locally degenerate, non-Fermi liquid Mott
insulator, to describe which requires a two-self-energy description. This is
shown to yield a number of exact results for the associated local moment,
charge, and interaction-renormalised levels, together with a generalisation of
Luttinger's theorem to the Mott insulator.

spectral basis induced by nonlinear dimension reduction on patches), and we
call the resulting frame elements {\it convolution framelets}. Insight gained
from analyzing the proposed representation leads to a novel interpretation of a
recent high-performance patch-based image inpainting algorithm using Point
Integral Method (PIM) and Low Dimension Manifold Model (LDMM) [Osher, Shi and
Zhu, 2016]. In particular, we show that LDMM is a weighted
$\ell_2$-regularization on the coefficients obtained by decomposing images into
linear combinations of convolution framelets; based on this understanding, we
extend the original LDMM to a reweighted version that yields further improved
inpainting results. In addition, we establish the energy concentration property
of convolution framelet coefficients for the setting where the local basis is
constructed from a given nonlocal basis via a linear reconstruction framework;
a generalization of this framework to unions of local embeddings can provide a
natural setting for interpreting BM3D, one of the state-of-the-art image

It was proposed to overcome the deficiencies of conventional entropy methods
when quantifying the complexity of time series. However, MSE is undefined for
very short signals and slow for real-time applications because of the use of
sample entropy (SampEn). To overcome these shortcomings, we introduce
multiscale dispersion entropy (DisEn - MDE) as a very fast and powerful method
to quantify the complexity of signals. MDE is based on our recently developed
DisEn, which has a computation cost of O(N), compared with O(N2) for SampEn. We
also propose the refined composite MDE (RCMDE) to improve the stability of MDE.
We evaluate MDE, RCMDE, and refined composite MSE (RCMSE) on synthetic signals
and find that these methods have similar behaviors but the MDE and RCMDE are
significantly faster than MSE and RCMSE, respectively. The results also
illustrate that RCMDE is more stable than MDE for short and noisy signals,
which are common in biomedical applications. To evaluate the proposed methods
on real signals, we employ three biomedical datasets, including focal and
non-focal electroencephalograms (EEGs), blood pressure recordings in Fantasia
database, and resting-state EEGs activity in Alzheimer's disease (AD). The
results again demonstrate a similar behavior of RCMSE, MDE and RCMDE, although
the RCMDE and MDE are significantly faster and lead to larger differences
between physiological conditions known to alter the complexity of the
physiological recordings. To sum up, MDE and RCMDE are expected to be useful
for the analysis of physiological signals thanks to their ability to
distinguish different types of dynamics.

the state of the system or the sequence of operations that have been performed.
Unfortunately, consensus algorithms including Multi-Paxos in particular are
well-known to be difficult to understand, and their accurate specifications and
correctness proofs remain challenging, despite extensive studies ever since
Lamport introduced Paxos.
  This article describes formal specification and verification of Lamport's
Multi-Paxos algorithm for distributed consensus. The specification is written

automatically checked using TLAPS, the TLA+ Proof System. The proof is for the

Paxos, and to demonstrate a general way of proving other variants of Paxos and
other sophisticated distributed algorithms. We also discuss our general

properties is therefore of primary importance for further advances in these
research fields. In this work we report on the investigation in the formation
of photoluminescent (PL) defects upon MeV He implantation in diamond. Such
color centers, previously reported only in electroluminescence and
cathodoluminescence regime, exhibited two sharp emission lines at 536.5 nm and
560.5 nm, without significant phonon sidebands. A strong correlation between
the PL intensities of the above-mentioned emission lines and the He
implantation fluence was found in the 10^15-10^17 cm^{-2} fluence range. The PL
emission features were not detected in control samples, i.e. samples that were
either unirradiated or irradiated with different ion species (H, C). Moreover,
the PL emission lines disappeared in samples that were He-implanted above the
graphitization threshold. Therefore, the PL features are attributed to
optically active defects in the diamond matrix associated with He impurities.
The intensity of the 536.5 nm and 560.5 nm emission lines was investigated as a
function of the annealing temperature of the diamond substrate. The emission
was observed upon annealing at temperatures higher than 500{\deg}C, at the
expenses of the concurrently decreasing neutral-vacancy-related GR1 emission
intensity. Therefore, our findings indicate that the luminescence originates
from the formation of a stable lattice defect. Finally, the emission was
investigated under different laser excitations wavelengths (i.e. 532 nm and 405
nm) with the purpose of gaining a preliminary insight about the position of the
related levels in the energy gap of diamond.

Rieke, and Kristoffer Eriksen","Variability in the Near-Infrared Synchrotron Emission From Cassiopeia A","submitted to ApJ",,,,"astro-ph.HE astro-ph.SR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We present multi-epoch Ks band imaging of the supernova remnant Cassiopeia A
(Cas A). The morphology of the emission in this band is generally diffuse and
filamentary, consistent with synchrotron radiation observed at radio
wavelengths. However, in one region to the southwest of the remnant, compact
knots of emission appear to be entrained in the ejecta and have the same proper
motion as ejecta observed at similar projected radii. The presence of these
knots suggests that material with high magnetic field strength contributes
significantly to synchrotron emission at these wavelengths. We analyze these
knots at J, H, and Ks bands as well as in 3.5-8 micron emission and at 6 cm
where synchrotron emission is dominant and we find that the Ks band emission
falls along the expected synchrotron spectrum. Using multi-epoch data, we
calculate the magnetic field strength and electron density for a population of
near-infrared synchrotron-emitting electrons. We find electron densities from
1,000-15,000 cm$^{-3}$ and magnetic field strengths from 1.3-5.8 mG. These
magnetic field strengths are an order of magnitude higher than inferred from
the much lower angular resolution gamma-ray observations toward Cas A. We
conclude that dense knots of post-shock material behind the Cas A shock front
are emitting synchrotron emission in a compressed and enhanced magnetic field.

engineered hybrid quantum systems, we investigate gain in a microwave photonic
cavity coupled to quantum dot structures, and develop concrete directions for
achieving a giant amplification in photon transmission. We propose two
architectures for scaling up the electronic gain medium: (i) $N$ double quantum
dot systems (N-DQD), (ii) $M$ quantum dots arranged in series akin to a quantum
cascade laser setup. In both setups, the fermionic reservoirs are voltage
biased, and the quantum dots are coupled to a single-mode cavity. Optical
amplification is explained based on a sum rule for the transmission function,
and it is determined by an intricate competition between two different
processes: charge density response in the gain medium, and cavity losses to
input and output ports. The same design principle is also responsible for the
corresponding giant amplification in other photonic observables, mean photon
number and emission spectrum, thereby realizing a quantum device that behaves
as a giant microwave amplifier.

from the first binary pulsar, PSR B1913+16, acquired over the last thirty-five
years. The determination of the 'Keplerian' orbital elements plus two
relativistic terms completely characterizes the binary system, aside from an
unknown rotation about the line of sight; leading to a determination of the
masses of the pulsar and its companion: 1.438 $\pm$ 0.001 solar masses and
1.390 $\pm$ 0.001 solar masses, respectively. In addition, the complete system
characterization allows the creation of tests of relativistic gravitation by
comparing measured and predicted sizes of various relativistic phenomena. We
find that the ratio of observed orbital period decrease due to gravitational
wave damping (corrected by a kinematic term) to the general relativistic
prediction, is 0.9983 pm 0.0016; thereby confirming the existence and strength
of gravitational radiation as predicted by general relativity. For the first
time in this system, we have also successfully measured the two parameters
characterizing the Shapiro gravitational propagation delay, and find that their
values are consistent with general relativistic predictions. We have also
measured for the first time in any system the relativistic shape correction to
the elliptical orbit, $\delta_{\theta}$,although its intrinsic value is
obscured by currently unquantified pulsar emission beam aberration. We have
also marginally measured the time derivative of the projected semimajor axis,
which, when improved in combination with beam aberration modelling from
geodetic precession observations, should ultimately constrain the pulsar's
moment of inertia.
