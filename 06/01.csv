activity in a global, 3D, magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulation of a convective
dynamo. This simulation is characterized by coherent bands of toroidal field
that exist within the convection zone, with opposite polarities in the northern
and southern hemispheres. Throughout most of the cycle, the magnetic helicity
in these bands is negative in the northern hemisphere and positive in the
southern hemisphere. However, during the declining phase of each cycle, this
hemispheric rule reverses. We attribute this to a global restructuring of the
magnetic topology that is induced by the interaction of the bands across the
equator. This band interaction appears to be ultimately responsible for, or at
least associated with, the decay and subsequent reversal of both the toroidal
bands and the polar fields. We briefly discuss the implications of these
results within the context of solar observations, which also show some
potential evidence for toroidal band interactions and helicity reversals.

asking which Gaussian unitary transformations are reachable by turning on and
off a given set of quadratic Hamiltonians. For compact groups, including finite
dimensional unitary groups, the well known Lie algebra rank criterion provides
a sufficient and necessary condition for the reachable set to cover the whole
group. Because of the non-compact nature of the symplectic group, which
corresponds to Gaussian unitary transformations, this criterion turns out to be
still necessary but not sufficient for Gaussian systems. If the control
Hamiltonians are unstable, in a sense made rigorous in the main text, the
peculiar situation may arise where the rank criterion is satisfied and yet not
all symplectic transformations are reachable. Here, we address this situation
for one degree of freedom and study the properties of the reachable set under
unstable control Hamiltonians. First, we provide a partial analytical
characterisation of the reachable set and prove that no orthogonal
(`energy-preserving' or `passive' in the literature) symplectic operations may
be reached with such controls. Then, we apply numerical optimal control
algorithms to demonstrate a complete characterisation of the set in specific
cases.

out of asymmetric fission, which is associated with a higher TKE compared to
symmetric fission. The average TKE associated with the superlong, standard I

Employing the large deviation techniques presented in [Gingrich et al., Phys.

involves a measure of partial entropy production, that we interpret as the
least amount of entropy that a system sustaining current $J$ can possibly
produce, at a given steady state. We provide a complete mathematical discussion

argue that the relationship for the Fano factor of the entropy production rate

paper we ask: Given two decomposition spaces, is there an embedding between the
two?
  A decomposition space $\mathcal{D}(\mathcal{Q}, L^p, Y)$ can be described
using : a covering $\mathcal{Q}=(Q_{i})_{i\in I}$ of the frequency domain, an
exponent $p$ and a sequence space $Y\subset\mathbb{C}^{I}$. Given these, the
decomp. space norm of a distribution $g$ is $\| g\| _{\mathcal{D}(\mathcal{Q},
L^p, Y)}=\left\| \left(\left\|
\mathcal{F}^{-1}\left(\varphi_{i}\widehat{g}\right)\right\|
_{L^{p}}\right)_{i\in I}\right\| _{Y}$, where $(\varphi_{i})_{i\in I}$ is a
suitable partition of unity for $\mathcal{Q}$.
  We establish readily verifiable criteria which ensure an embedding
$\mathcal{D}(\mathcal{Q}, L^{p_1}, Y)\hookrightarrow\mathcal{D}(\mathcal{P},
L^{p_2}, Z)$, mostly concentrating on the case, $Y=\ell_{w}^{q_{1}}(I)$ and
$Z=\ell_{v}^{q_{2}}(J)$.
  The relevant sufficient conditions are $p_{1}\leq p_{2}$, and finiteness of a
norm of the form \[ \left\| \left(\left\| (\alpha_{i}\,\beta_j \cdot
v_{j}/w_{i})_{i\in I_{j}}\right\| _{\ell^{t}}\right)_{j\in J}\right\|
_{\ell^{s}}<\infty, \] where the \[ I_{j}=\{ i\in I : Q_{i}\cap
P_{j}\neq\emptyset\} \qquad\text{ for }j\in J \] are defined in terms of the
two coverings $\mathcal{Q}=(Q_{i})_{i\in I}$ and $\mathcal{P}=(P_{j})_{j\in
J}$.
  We also show that these criteria are sharp: For almost arbitrary coverings
and certain ranges of $p_{1},p_{2}$, our criteria yield a complete
characterization. The same holds for arbitrary values of $p_{1},p_{2}$ under
more strict assumptions on the coverings.
  We illustrate the resulting theory by applications to $\alpha$-modulation and
Besov spaces. All known embedding results for these spaces are special cases of
our approach; often, we improve considerably upon the state of the art.

bipolar outflow, is an excellent source for studying shock chemistry, including
grain-surface chemistry prior to shocks, and post-shock, gas-phase processing.
The L1157-B1 and B2 positions experienced shocks at an estimated ~2000 and 4000
years ago, respectively. Prior to these shock events, temperatures were too low
for most complex organic molecules to undergo thermal desorption. Thus, the
shocks should have liberated these molecules from the ice grain-surfaces en
masse, evidenced by prior observations of SiO and multiple grain mantle species
commonly associated with shocks. Grain species, such as OCS, CH3OH, and HNCO,
all peak at different positions relative to species that are preferably formed
in higher velocity shocks or repeatedly-shocked material, such as SiO and HCN.
Here, we present high spatial resolution (~3"") maps of CH3OH, HNCO, HCN, and
HCO+ in the southern portion of the outflow containing B1 and B2, as observed
with CARMA. The HNCO maps are the first interferometric observations of this
species in L1157. The maps show distinct differences in the chemistry within
the various shocked regions in L1157B. This is further supported through
constraints of the molecular abundances using the non-LTE code RADEX (Van der
Tak et al. 2007). We find the east/west chemical differentiation in C2 may be
explained by the contrast of the shock's interaction with either cold, pristine
material or warm, previously-shocked gas, as seen in enhanced HCN abundances.
In addition, the enhancement of the HNCO abundance toward the the older shock,
B2, suggests the importance of high-temperature O-chemistry in shocked regions.

sites provide a target to fine-tune protein activity, yet we lack computational
methods to predict them. Here, we present an efficient graph-theoretical
approach for identifying allosteric sites and the mediating interactions that
connect them to the active site. Using an atomistic graph with edges weighted
by covalent and non-covalent bond energies, we obtain a bond-to-bond propensity
that quantifies the effect of instantaneous bond fluctuations propagating
through the protein. We use this propensity to detect the sites and
communication pathways most strongly linked to the active site, assessing their
significance through quantile regression and comparison against a reference set
of 100 generic proteins. We exemplify our method in detail with three
well-studied allosteric proteins: caspase-1, CheY, and h-Ras, correctly
predicting the location of the allosteric site and identifying key allosteric
interactions. Consistent prediction of allosteric sites is then attained in a
further set of 17 proteins known to exhibit allostery. Because our propensity
measure runs in almost linear time, it offers a scalable approach to
high-throughput searches for candidate allosteric sites.

communications on secret key generation via physical layer channel state
information is investigated. A key generation strategy for IBFD wireless
devices to increase the rate of generated secret keys over multipath fading

wireless transmissions, sensing simultaneous reciprocal channel measurements is
not possible, which leads to a degraded key generation rate. However, with the
advent of IBFD wireless devices, the legitimate nodes can sense the shared
wireless link simultaneously at the possible cost of a self-interference (SI)
channel estimation and some residual self-interference (RSI). As we
demonstrate, with HD correlated observations the key rate is upper bounded by a
constant, while with IBFD the key rate is only limited by the SI cancellation
performance and is in general greater than that of its HD counterpart. Our
analysis shows that with reasonable levels of SI cancellation, in the high SNR
regime the key rate of IBFD is much higher, while in low SNRs, the HD system
performs better. Finally, the key rate loss due to the overhead imposed by the
SI channel estimation phase is discussed.

oscillations of the VULF signals at the VULF Compton frequencies at individual
devices, here I consider a network of such devices. VULFs are essentially dark
matter {\em waves} and as such they carry both temporal and spatial phase
information. Thereby, the discovery reach can be improved by using networks of
precision measurement tools. To formalize this idea, I derive a spatio-temporal
two-point correlation function for the ultralight dark matter fields in the
framework of the standard halo model. Due to VULFs being Gaussian random
fields, the derived two-point correlation function fully determines $N$-point
correlation functions. For a network of $N_{d}$ devices within the coherence
length of the field, the sensitivity compared to a single device can be
improved by a factor of $\sqrt{N_{d}}$. Further, I derive a VULF dark matter
signal profile for an individual device. The resulting line shape is strongly
asymmetric due to the parabolic dispersion relation for massive
non-relativistic bosons. I discuss the aliasing effect that extends the
discovery reach to VULF frequencies higher than the experimental sampling rate.
I present sensitivity estimates and develop a stochastic field SNR statistic.

Gerstenhaber algebra structures. We establish the following formality theorem
for Lie pairs: there exists an $L_\infty$ quasi isomorphism from $\cx{T}$ to
$\cx{D}$ whose first Taylor coefficient is equal to
$\operatorname{hkr}\circ\td$. Here $\td$ acts on $\cx{T}$ by contraction.

image processing algorithms. Many quantum image processing schemes claim that
their efficiency are theoretically higher than their corresponding classical
schemes. However, most of them do not consider the problem of measurement. As
we all know, measurement will lead to collapse. That is to say, executing the
algorithm once, users can only measure the final state one time. Therefore, if
users want to regain the results (the processed images), they must execute the
algorithms many times and then measure the final state many times to get all
the pixels' values. If the measurement process is taken into account, whether
or not the algorithms are really efficient needs to be reconsidered. In this
paper, we try to solve the problem of measurement and give a quantum image
matching algorithm. Unlike most of the QIP algorithms, our scheme interests
only one pixel (the target pixel) instead of the whole image. It modifies the
probability of pixels based on Grover's algorithm to make the target pixel to
be measured with higher probability, and the measurement step is executed only
once. An example is given to explain the algorithm more vividly. Complexity
analysis indicates that the quantum scheme's complexity is $O(2^{n})$ in

2 stellar radii or less, prior to the formation of silicates. Al$_2$O$_3$
grains are therefore prime candidates for producing the scattered light
observed in the close vicinity of several M-type AGB stars, and they may be
seed particles for the condensation of silicates at lower temperatures. We have
constructed a new generation of Dynamic Atmosphere & Radiation-driven Wind
models based on Implicit Numerics (DARWIN), including a time-dependent
treatment of grain growth & evaporation for both Al$_2$O$_3$ and Fe-free
silicates (Mg$_2$SiO$_4$). The equations describing these dust species are
solved in the framework of a frequency-dependent radiation-hydrodynamical model
for the atmosphere & wind structure, taking pulsation-induced shock waves and
periodic luminosity variations into account. Condensation of Al$_2$O$_3$ at the
close distances and in the high concentrations implied by observations requires
high transparency of the grains in the visual and near-IR region to avoid
destruction by radiative heating. For solar abundances, radiation pressure due
to Al$_2$O$_3$ is too low to drive a wind. Nevertheless, this dust species may
have indirect effects on mass loss. The formation of composite grains with an
Al$_2$O$_3$ core and a silicate mantle can give grain growth a head start,
increasing both mass loss rates and wind velocities. Furthermore, our
experimental core-mantle grain models lead to variations of visual and near-IR
colors during a pulsation cycle which are in excellent agreement with

angular-correlation function of the cosmic microwave background temperature
anisotropies is anomalously low for angular separations greater than about 60
degrees. Physics explanations of this anomaly typically focus on the properties
of the Universe at the surface of last scattering, relying on the fact that
large-angle temperature fluctuations are dominated by the Sachs-Wolfe effect
(SW). However, these fluctuations also receive important contributions from the
integrated Sachs-Wolfe effect (ISW) at both early (eISW) and late ($\ell$ISW)
times. Here we study the correlations in those large-angle temperature
fluctuations and their relative contributions to $S_{1/2}$ -- the standard
measure of the correlations on large angular scales. We find that in the
best-fitting $\Lambda$CDM cosmology, while the auto-correlation of the early
contributions (SW plus eISW) dominates $S_{1/2}$, there are also significant
contributions originating from cross-terms between the early and late
contributions. In particular, realizations of $\Lambda$CDM with low $S_{1/2}$
are typically produced from a combination of somewhat low pure-early
correlations and accidental cancellations among early-late correlations. We
also find that if the pure $\ell$ISW auto-correlations were the only
contribution to $S_{1/2}$ in $\Lambda$CDM, then the $p$-value of the observed
cut-sky $S_{1/2}$ would be unremarkable. This suggests that physical mechanisms
operating only at or near the last scattering surface could explain the
observed lack of large-angle correlations, though this is not the typical

we address the question of how manipulable Condorcet-consistent rules must
necessarily be - by trying to minimize the difference between the increase in
$\Pr[r(T) = i]$ and decrease in $\Pr[r(T) = j]$ for any potential manipulating
pair.
  We show that every Condorcet-consistent rule is in fact $1/3$-manipulable,
and that selecting a winner according to a random single elimination bracket is
not $\alpha$-manipulable for any $\alpha > 1/3$. We also show that many
previously studied tournament formats are all $1/2$-manipulable, and the
popular class of Copeland rules (any rule that selects a player with the most
wins) are all in fact $1$-manipulable, the worst possible. Finally, we consider
extensions to match-fixing among sets of more than two players.

The typical stellar population age of compact E+A galaxies is <1 Gyr. The
existence of compact E+A galaxies with young stellar populations at 0.2<z<0.8
means that some compact quiescent galaxies first appear at intermediate

appearance rate of new compact quiescent galaxies at 0.2<z<0.8. The lower limit
number density of compact quiescent galaxies which may appear at z<0.8 is
comparable to the lower limit of the total number density of compact quiescent

system because of its two inequivalent, direct-gap valleys that lead to exotic
bound and excited states. Here we focus on one such bound state, the negatively
charged trion. Unlike excitons, trions can radiatively decay with non-zero
momentum by kicking out an electron, resulting in an asymmetric trion
photoluminescence (PL) peak with a long low-energy tail. As a consequence, the
peak position does not correspond to the zero momentum trion energy. By
including the trion's long tail in our analysis we are able to accurately
separate the exciton from the trion contributions to the PL spectra. According
to theory, the asymmetric energy tail has both a size-dependent and a
temperature-dependent contribution. Analysis of the temperature-dependent data
reveals the effective trion size, consistent with literature, and the
temperature dependence of the band gap and spin-orbit splitting of the valence
band. Finally, we observe signatures of Pauli-blocking of the trion decay.

Thirteen CO vibrational bands in this absorber are detected: the A$^{1}\Pi$ -
X$^{1}\Sigma^{+}$ ($\nu'$,0) for $\nu' = 0 - 8$, B$^{1}\Sigma^{+}$ -
X$^{1}\Sigma^{+}$ (0,0), C$^{1}\Sigma^{+}$ - X$^{1}\Sigma^{+}$ (0,0), and

$\Delta\mu/\mu = (-5.6 \pm 5.6_{stat} \pm 3.1_{syst}) \times 10^{-6}$, which is

of the leading-order coefficients, driven by a rough right hand side. For
simplicity, we consider a space-time periodic setting with a single spatial
variable: \begin{equation*} \partial_2u -P( a(u)\partial_1^2u - \sigma(u)f ) =0
  \end{equation*} where $P$ is the projection on mean-zero functions, and $f$
is a distribution and only controlled in the low regularity norm of $
C^{\alpha-2}$ for $\alpha > \frac{2}{3}$ on the parabolic H\""older scale.
  The example we have in mind is a random forcing $f$ and our assumptions
allow, for example, for an $f$ which is white in the time variable $x_2$ and
only mildly coloured in the space variable $x_1$; any spatial covariance
operator $(1 + |\partial_1|)^{-\lambda_1 }$ with $\lambda_1 > \frac13$ is
admissible.
  On the deterministic side we obtain a $C^\alpha$-estimate for $u$, assuming
that we control products of the form $v\partial_1^2v$ and $vf$ with $v$ solving
the constant-coefficient equation $\partial_2 v-a_0\partial_1^2v=f$. As a
consequence, we obtain existence, uniqueness and stability with respect to $(f,
vf, v \partial_1^2v)$ of small space-time periodic solutions for small data. We
then demonstrate how the required products can be bounded in the case of a
random forcing $f$ using stochastic arguments.
  For this we extend the treatment of the singular product $\sigma(u)f$ via a
space-time version of Gubinelli's notion of controlled rough paths to the
product $a(u)\partial_1^2u$, which has the same degree of singularity but is
more nonlinear since the solution $u$ appears in both factors. The PDE
ingredient mimics the (kernel-free) Krylov-Safanov approach to ordinary
Schauder theory.

general renormalised perturbation theory approach. We use combined Gibbs and
Hamiltonian sampling, implemented in the \textsc{argo} code, to iteratively
reconstruct the dark matter density field and the coherent peculiar velocities
of individual galaxies, correcting hereby for coherent redshift space
distortions (RSD). Our tests relying on accurate $N$-body based mock galaxy

field up to $k\sim0.2\, h$ Mpc$^{-1}$, and vanishing quadrupoles down to

then study the density correlations across the horizon and the non-separable

accurate approximations when the initial temperature is not too high. We also
show that the phases of the scattering coefficients introduce a finite shift of
the location of the correlations which was so far overlooked. This shift is due
to the asymmetry of the flow across the horizon, and persists in the
dispersion-less regime. Finally we show how the formation of the sonic horizon
modifies both local and non-local density correlations.

observational signatures for the particular case of the 166 Hz quasi-periodic

IXPE (Imaging X-ray Polarimetry Explorer), PolSTAR (Polarization Spectroscopic

make it possible to get a QPO phase for each photon, enabling the study of the
QPO-phase-resolved spectral shape and the correlation between this and the flux
level. Owing to the short periods of the HFQPOs, first-generation X-ray
polarimeters would not be able to assign a QPO phase to each photon. The study
of QPO-phase-resolved polarization energy spectra would thus require
simultaneous observations with a first-generation X-ray polarimeter and a

equation reveals that maximum entropy states of a neutral vortex gas that
describe the spectral condensation of energy can be classified into types of

momentum. Numerical simulations of a neutral point vortex model and a Bose gas
governed by the 2D Gross-Pitaevskii equation in a square reveal that a large

is measured in proton-proton collision data corresponding to an integrated
luminosity of 3.0 fb$^{-1}$, recorded by the LHCb experiment at centre-of-mass
energies of 7 and 8 TeV. Semileptonic $B_s^0$ and $\overline{B}{}_s^0$ decays
are studied in the inclusive mode $D_s^{\mp} \mu^{\pm} \nu_{\mu} X$ with the
$D_s^{\mp}$ mesons reconstructed in the $K^+ K^- \pi^{\mp}$ final state.
Correcting the observed charge asymmetry for detection and background effects,
the $CP$ asymmetry is found to be $a_{\text{sl}}^s = (0.39 \pm 0.26 \pm 0.20)

This is the most precise measurement of $a_{\text{sl}}^s$ to date. It is
consistent with the prediction from the Standard Model and will constrain new
models of particle physics.

decision support can be designed and developed in order to improve the quality
of health care. To answer this research question, several sub-questions were
identified and investigated. This included analyzing state of the art in two
different aspects of design and development and evaluation of Clinical Decision
Support (CDS) and also investigating application of a customized user-centered
design (UCD) process in developing openEHR-based clinical applications.
Analysis of state of the art in interplay between Human-Computer Interaction
(HCI) and CDS and also the intersection between CDS and Electronic Health
Records (EHR) revealed that consideration of both HCI and integration of CDS
into EHR is more appreciated in theory than in practice and there is still a
long way to go before reaching an acceptable level in these two success factors
of CDS. Moreover, the experience in designing an openEHR-based clinical
application revealed that apart from benefits offered by openEHR approach, such
as specifying different roles and involvement of domain experts in defining
domain concepts, there are various shortcomings that need to be improved, for
instance the limited support for openEHR application developers. Additionally,
this study revealed that there are characteristics of the domain, tasks and
users in the domain that developers should be informed about while applying UCD
methods.

theoretical justification when applied to non-convex problems. We show that
running stochastic gradient descent (SGD) in an asynchronous manner can be
viewed as adding a momentum-like term to the SGD iteration. Our result does not
assume convexity of the objective function, so it is applicable to deep
learning systems. We observe that a standard queuing model of asynchrony
results in a form of momentum that is commonly used by deep learning
practitioners. This forges a link between queuing theory and asynchrony in deep
learning systems, which could be useful for systems builders. For convolutional
neural networks, we experimentally validate that the degree of asynchrony
directly correlates with the momentum, confirming our main result. An important
implication is that tuning the momentum parameter is important when considering
different levels of asynchrony. We assert that properly tuned momentum reduces
the number of steps required for convergence. Finally, our theory suggests new
ways of counteracting the adverse effects of asynchrony: a simple mechanism
like using negative algorithmic momentum can improve performance under high
asynchrony. Since asynchronous methods have better hardware efficiency, this
result may shed light on when asynchronous execution is more efficient for deep
learning systems.

social networks, to discover the relative frequency of small subgraphs within
them are of high interest to sociologists, computer scientists and marketeers
alike. However, the computation of these network motif statistics via naive
enumeration is infeasible for either its prohibitive computational costs or
access restrictions on the full graph data. Methods to estimate the motif
statistics based on random walks by sampling only a small fraction of the
subgraphs in the large graph address both of these challenges. In this paper,
we present a new algorithm, called the Waddling Random Walk (WRW), which
estimates the concentration of motifs of any size. It derives its name from the
fact that it sways a little to the left and to the right, thus also sampling
nodes not directly on the path of the random walk. The WRW algorithm achieves
its computational efficiency by not trying to enumerate subgraphs around the
random walk but instead using a randomized protocol to sample subgraphs in the
neighborhood of the nodes visited by the walk. In addition, WRW achieves
significantly higher accuracy (measured by the closeness of its estimate to the
correct value) and higher precision (measured by the low variance in its
estimations) than the current state-of-the-art algorithms for mining subgraph
statistics. We illustrate these advantages in speed, accuracy and precision
using simulations on well-known and widely used graph datasets representing
real networks.

the roots are the permutations starting with 1 and the leaves are derangements.
Viewing the process in the opposite direction towards the leaves, one picks a
fixed point and moves it to the beginning. Despite its simplicity, this ""fixed
point forest"" exhibits a rich structure. In this paper, we consider the fixed
point forest in the limit $n\to \infty$ and show using Stein's method that at a
random permutation the local structure weakly converges to a tree defined in
terms of independent Poisson point processes. We also show that the
distribution of the length of the longest path to a leaf converges to the
geometric distribution with mean $e-1$, and the length of the shortest path
converges to the Poisson distribution with mean 1. In addition, the higher
moments are bounded and hence the expectations converge as well.

oblivious cloud storage system, ObliviSync, that specifically targets one of
the most widely-used personal cloud storage paradigms: synchronization and
backup services, popular examples of which are Dropbox, iCloud Drive, and
Google Drive. This setting provides a unique opportunity because the above
privacy properties can be achieved with a simpler form of ORAM called
write-only ORAM, which allows for dramatically increased efficiency compared to
related work. Our solution is asymptotically optimal and practically efficient,
with a small constant overhead of approximately 4x compared with non-private
file storage, depending only on the total data size and parameters chosen
according to the usage rate, and not on the number or size of individual files.
Our construction also offers protection against timing-channel attacks, which
has not been previously considered in ORAM protocols. We built and evaluated a
full implementation of ObliviSync that supports multiple simultaneous read-only
clients and a single concurrent read/write client whose edits automatically and
seamlessly propagate to the readers. We show that our system functions under
high work loads, with realistic file size distributions, and with small
additional latency (as compared to a baseline encrypted file system) when
paired with Dropbox as the synchronization service.

the International Astronomical Union (IAU) resolution vote at the XXIX-th
General Assembly in Honolulu, Hawaii, in 2015, on recommended nominal
conversion constants for selected solar and planetary properties. The problem
addressed by the resolution is a lack of established conversion constants
between solar and planetary values and SI units: a missing standard has caused
a proliferation of solar values (e.g., solar radius, solar irradiance, solar
luminosity, solar effective temperature and solar mass parameter) in the
literature, with cited solar values typically based on best estimates at the
time of paper writing. As precision of observations increases, a set of
consistent values becomes increasingly important. To address this, an IAU
Working Group on Nominal Units for Stellar and Planetary Astronomy formed in
2011, uniting experts from the solar, stellar, planetary, exoplanetary and
fundamental astronomy, as well as from general standards fields to converge on
optimal values for nominal conversion constants. The effort resulted in the IAU
2015 Resolution B3, passed at the IAU General Assembly by a large majority. The
resolution recommends the use of nominal solar and planetary values, which are
by definition exact and are expressed in SI units. These nominal values should
be understood as conversion factors only, not as the true solar/planetary
properties or current best estimates. Authors and journal editors are urged to
join in using the standard values set forth by this resolution in future work
and publications to help minimize further confusion.

disc that is less vertically concentrated and does not reach such high

arms increases at a lower rate for the RAMSES simulations compared to the other
codes. There is also a greater degree of substructure in the sphNG and GIZMO

the Lagrangian codes used in this study. Other alterations to the refinement
scheme (adding extra levels of refinement and refining based on local density

sphNG/GIZMO. Although more similar, sphNG displays different density
distributions and vertical mass profiles to all modes of GIZMO (including the
smoothed particle hydrodynamics version). This suggests differences also arise
which are not intrinsic to the particular method but rather due to its

of lithium from the photospheres of cool stars during the main sequence.
However, previous mixing calculations have relied primarily on treatments of
angular momentum transport in stellar interiors incompatible with solar and
stellar data, in the sense that they overestimate internal differential
rotation. Instead, recent studies suggest that stars are strongly
differentially rotating at young ages, but approach solid body rotation during
their lifetimes. We modify our rotating stellar evolution code to include an
additional source of angular momentum transport, a necessary ingredient for
explaining the open cluster rotation pattern, and examine the consequences for
mixing. We confirm that core-envelope recoupling with a $\sim$20 Myr timescale
is required to explain the evolution of the mean solar-mass rotation pattern
along the main sequence, and demonstrate that it also provides a more accurate
description of the Li depletion pattern seen in open clusters. Recoupling
produces a characteristic pattern of efficient mixing at early ages and little
mixing at late ages, thus predicting a flattening of Li depletion at a few Gyr,
in agreement with the observed late-time evolution. Using Li abundances, we
argue that the timescale for core-envelope recoupling during the main sequence
decreases sharply with increasing mass. We discuss implications of this finding
for stellar physics, including the viability of gravity waves and magnetic
fields as agents of angular momentum transport. We also raise the possibility
of intrinsic differences in initial conditions in star clusters, using M67 as
an example.

from the line profile, yielding a \vturb{}. The second assumes two different
molecules are co-spatial thus their relative linewidths allow for a calculation
of \Tkin{} and \vturb{}. Finally we fit a parametric disk model where physical
properties of the disk are described by power laws, to compare our `direct'
methods with previous values. The two direct methods were limited to the outer
$r > 40$~au disk due to beam smear. The direct method found \vturb{} ranging
from $\approx$~\vel{130} at 40~au, dropping to $\approx$~\vel{50} in the outer
disk, qualitatively recovered with the parametric model fitting. This
corresponds to roughly $0.2 - 0.4~c_s$. CN was found to exhibit strong non-LTE
effects outside $r \approx 140$~au, so \vturb{} was limited to within this
radius. The assumption that CN and CS are co-spatial is consistent with
observed linewidths only within $r \lesssim 100$~au, within which \vturb{} was
found to drop from \vel{100} ($\approx~0.4~c_s$) to nothing at 100~au. The
parametric model yielded a near constant \vel{50} for CS ($0.2 - 0.4~c_s$). We
demonstrate that absolute flux calibration is and will be the limiting factor
in all studies of turbulence using a single molecule. The magnitude of the
dispersion is comparable with or below that predicted by the magneto-rotational
instability theory. A more precise comparison would require to reach an
absolute calibration precision of order 3\%, or to find a suitable combination

star-forming galaxies at z$\,\sim\,$2 in the CANDELS fields with the

emission lines which trace the hot ionized gas surrounding star-forming
regions. We find that by z$\,\sim\,$2, massive star-forming galaxies
($\log\,M_*/M_{\odot}\gtrsim10.2$) have assembled primitive disks: their
kinematics are dominated by rotation, they are consistent with a marginally
stable disk model, and they form a Tully-Fisher relation. These massive
galaxies have values of $V_{rot}/\sigma_g$ which are factors of 2-5 lower than
local well-ordered galaxies at similar masses. Such results are consistent with
findings by other studies. We find that low mass galaxies
($\log\,M_*/M_{\odot}\lesssim10.2$) at this epoch are still in the early stages
of disk assembly: their kinematics are often supported by gas velocity
dispersion and they fall from the Tully-Fisher relation to significantly low
values of $V_{rot}$. This ""kinematic downsizing"" implies that the process(es)
responsible for disrupting disks at z$\,\sim\,$2 have a stronger effect and/or
are more active in low mass systems. In conclusion, we find that the period of

modes within the bulk of two-dimensional engineered quantum systems. Our method
is based on the implementation of topological interfaces, designed within the
bulk of the system, where topologically-protected edge modes localize and
freely propagate in a unidirectional manner. This scheme is illustrated through
an optical-lattice realization of the Haldane model for cold atoms, where an
additional spatially-varying lattice potential induces distinct topological
phases in separated regions of space. We present two realistic experimental
configurations, which lead to linear and radial-symmetric topological
interfaces, which both allows one to significantly reduce the effects of
external confinement on topological edge properties. Furthermore, the
versatility of our method opens the possibility of tuning the position, the
localization length and the chirality of the edge modes, through simple
adjustments of the lattice potentials. In order to demonstrate the unique
detectability offered by engineered interfaces, we numerically investigate the
time-evolution of wave packets, indicating how topological transport
unambiguously manifests itself within the lattice. Finally, we analyze the
effects of disorder on the dynamics of chiral and non-chiral states present in
the system. Interestingly, engineered disorder is shown to provide a powerful
tool for the detection of topological edge modes in cold-atom setups.

number of thermal effects. We show that, for low RH neutrino masses and thanks
to these effects, leptogenesis turns out to proceed efficiently from the decay
of the Standard Model (SM) scalar doublet components into a RH neutrino and a
lepton. Such decays produce the asymmetry at low temperatures, slightly before
sphaleron decoupling. If the RH neutrino has thermalized prior from producing
the asymmetry, this mechanism turns out to lead to the bound $m_N>2$ GeV. If,
instead, the RH neutrinos have not thermalized, leptogenesis from these decays
is enhanced further and can be easily successful, even at lower scales. This
Higgs-decay leptogenesis new mechanism works without requiring an interplay of
flavor effects and/or cancellations of large Yukawa couplings in the neutrino
mass matrix. Last but not least, such a scenario turns out to be testable, from
direct production of the RH neutrino(s).

a suite of simulations which explore how the initial gravitational boundedness,
and radiative feedback, affect cluster formation. We model the early evolution
($<$ 5 Myr) of turbulent, 10$^6$ M$_{\odot}$ clouds with virial parameters
ranging from 0.5 to 5. To model cluster formation, we use cluster sink
particles, coupled to a raytracing scheme, and a custom subgrid model which
populates a cluster via sampling an IMF with an efficiency of 20\% per freefall
time. We find that radiative feedback only decreases the cluster particle
formation efficiency by a few percent. The initial virial parameter plays a
much stronger role in limiting cluster formation, with a spread of cluster
formation efficiencies of 37\% to 71\% for the most unbound to the most bound
model. The total number of clusters increases while the maximum mass cluster
decreases with an increasing initial virial parameter, resulting in steeper
mass distributions. The star formation rates in our cluster particles are
initially consistent with observations but rise to higher values at late times.
This suggests that radiative feedback alone is not responsible for dispersing a

draw water from a subsurface ocean, but the sustainability of conduits linking
ocean and surface is not understood. Observations show sustained (though
tidally modulated) fissure eruptions throughout each orbit, and since the 2005
discovery of the plumes. Peak plume flux lags peak tidal extension by $\sim$1
radian, suggestive of resonance. Here we show that a model of the tiger stripes
as tidally-flexed slots that puncture the ice shell can simultaneously explain
the persistence of the eruptions through the tidal cycle, the phase lag, and
the total power output of the tiger stripe terrain, while suggesting that the
eruptions are maintained over geological timescales. The delay associated with
flushing and refilling of \emph{O}(1) m-wide slots with ocean water causes
erupted flux to lag tidal forcing and helps to buttress slots against closure,
while tidally pumped in-slot flow leads to heating and mechanical disruption
that staves off slot freeze-out. Much narrower and much wider slots cannot be
sustained. In the presence of long-lived slots, the 10$^6$-yr average power
output of the tiger stripes is buffered by a feedback between ice melt-back and
subsidence to \emph{O}(10$^{10}$) W, which is similar to the observed power
output, suggesting long-term stability. Turbulent dissipation makes testable
predictions for the final flybys of Enceladus by the \emph{Cassini} spacecraft.
Our model shows how open connections to an ocean can be reconciled with, and
sustain, long-lived eruptions. Turbulent dissipation in long-lived slots helps
maintain the ocean against freezing, maintains access by future Enceladus
missions to ocean materials, and is plausibly the major energy source for tiger
stripe activity.

LOCC protocol to implement the channel whenever such a protocol exists in any

analyzing LOCC channels is not much greater than that for LOCC measurements. We
apply the method to several examples, two of which provide numerical evidence
that the set of quantum channels that are not LOCC is not closed and that there
exist channels that can be implemented by LOCC either in one round or in three
rounds that are on the boundary of the set of all LOCC channels.
  Although every LOCC protocol must implement a separable quantum channel, it
is a very difficult task to determine whether or not a given channel is
separable. Fortunately, prior knowledge that the channel is separable is not
required for application of our method.

low-dimensional strain features originating from different aerodynamic

learning architecture for dictionary learning and sparse classification permits
fewer costly physical strain sensors while being simultaneously robust to
sensor noise. A measurement selection algorithm identifies frequencies that
best discriminate the different aerodynamic environments in low-rank POD

exploited to robustly identify different aerodynamic environments encountered
in flight, providing insight into the stereotyped placement of neurons that act

acceptable reference $R_{1064}$ to derive a column opacity product for

a reference $R_{1064}$ is derived by seeking $R^{M,N}_{1064}$: a
Minnaert-corrected normal albedo under clear conditions and assuming minimal
phase angle dependence. Over darker surfaces, $R^{M,N}_{1064}$ and the absolute
level of atmospheric opacity were estimated from active sounding. Over all
surfaces, the opacity derived from active sounding was used to exclude passive
radiometry measurements made under opaque conditions and estimate
$R^{M,N}_{1064}$. These latter estimates then were re-calibrated by comparison
with $R^{M,N}$ derived from Hubble Space Telescope (HST) observations over
areas of approximately uniform reflectivity. Estimates of $R^{M,N}_{1064}$ from
re-calibrated passive radiometry typically agree with HST observations within
10%. The resulting $R^{M,N}_{1064}$ is then used to derive and quantify the
uncertainties of a column opacity product, which can be applied to

that the system will unavoidably visit an absorbing, disease-free state at
sufficiently long times due to the finite size of the networks where epidemics
evolves. In the present work, we compare different quasistationary (QS)
simulation methods where the absorbing states are suitably handled and the
thermodynamical limit of the original dynamics can be achieved. We analyze the
standard QS (SQS) method, where the sampling is constrained to active
configurations, the reflecting boundary condition (RBC), where the dynamics
returns to the pre-absorbing configuration, and hub reactivation (HR), where
the most connected vertex of the network is reactivated after a visit to an
absorbing state. We apply the methods to the contact process (CP) and
susceptible-infected-susceptible (SIS) models on regular and scale free
networks. The investigated methods yield the same epidemic threshold for both
models. For CP, that undergoes a standard collective phase transition, the
methods are equivalent. For SIS, whose phase transition is ruled by the hub
mutual reactivation, the SQS and HR methods are able to capture localized
epidemic phases while RBC is not. We also apply the auto-correlation time as a
tool to characterize the phase transition and observe that this analysis
provides the same finite-size scaling exponents for the critical relaxation
time for the investigated methods. Finally, we verify the equivalence between
RBC method and a weak external field for epidemics on networks.

factorization formulation.
  The algorithm factorizes a sparse nonnegative tensor comprising the audio

local frequency modulations as separation cues is motivated by the principle of
common fate partial grouping from Auditory Scene Analysis, which hypothesizes
that each latent source in a mixture is characterized perceptually by coherent

multiplicative factor updates by Minorization-Maximization, which guarantees

  Science Case can be found at http://mse.cfht.hawaii.edu/docs/",,,,"astro-ph.IM astro-ph.GA","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  MSE is an 11.25m aperture observatory with a 1.5 square degree field of view
that will be fully dedicated to multi-object spectroscopy. More than 3200
fibres will feed spectrographs operating at low (R ~ 2000 - 3500) and moderate
(R ~ 6000) spectral resolution, and approximately 1000 fibers will feed
spectrographs operating at high (R ~ 40000) resolution. MSE is designed to
enable transformational science in areas as diverse as tomographic mapping of
the interstellar and intergalactic media; the in-situ chemical tagging of thick
disk and halo stars; connecting galaxies to their large scale structure;
measuring the mass functions of cold dark matter sub-halos in galaxy and
cluster-scale hosts; reverberation mapping of supermassive black holes in
quasars; next generation cosmological surveys using redshift space distortions
and peculiar velocities. MSE is an essential follow-up facility to current and
next generations of multi-wavelength imaging surveys, including LSST, Gaia,
Euclid, WFIRST, PLATO, and the SKA, and is designed to complement and go beyond
the science goals of other planned and current spectroscopic capabilities like
VISTA/4MOST, WHT/WEAVE, AAT/HERMES and Subaru/PFS. It is an ideal feeder
facility for E-ELT, TMT and GMT, and provides the missing link between wide
field imaging and small field precision astronomy. MSE is optimized for high
throughput, high signal-to-noise observations of the faintest sources in the
Universe with high quality calibration and stability being ensured through the
dedicated operational mode of the observatory. (abridged)

curation and exploration, from declarative languages, to specialized techniques
for data repair, and more. Yet, there is currently no consensus on how to best
expose these powerful tools to an analyst in a simple, intuitive, and above
all, flexible way. Thus, analysts continue to rely on tools such as
spreadsheets, imperative languages, and notebook style programming environments
like Jupyter for data curation. In this work, we explore the integration of
spreadsheets, notebooks, and relational databases. We focus on a key advantage
that both spreadsheets and imperative notebook environments have over classical
relational databases: ease of exception. By relying on set-at-a-time
operations, relational databases sacrifice the ability to easily define
singleton operations, exceptions to a normal data processing workflow that
affect query processing for a fixed set of explicitly targeted records. In
comparison, a spreadsheet user can easily change the formula for just one cell,
while a notebook user can add an imperative operation to her notebook that
alters an output 'view'. We believe that enabling such idiosyncratic manual
transformations in a classical relational database is critical for curation, as
curation operations that are easy to declare for individual values can often be
extremely challenging to generalize. We explore the challenges of enabling
singletons in relational databases, propose a hybrid spreadsheet/relational
notebook environment for data curation, and present our vision of Vizier, a
system that exposes data curation through such an interface.

the nucleated reversible self-assembly of monomeric building blocks into
polymer-like aggregates using the method of kinetic Monte Carlo. Kinetic Monte
Carlo, being inherently stochastic, allows us to study the impact of

characteristic features in this kind of problem is the existence of a lag phase

the associated lag time as a function of the system size and kinetic pathway.
We find that the leading order stochastic contribution to the lag time before

Pleiades has provided an anchor for stellar angular momentum models for both
younger and older stars. We used K2 to explore the distribution of rotation
periods in the Pleiades. With more than 500 new periods for Pleiades members,
we are vastly expanding the number of Pleiads with periods, particularly at the
low mass end. About 92\% of the members in our sample have at least one
measured spot-modulated rotation period. For the $\sim$8\% of the members
without periods, non-astrophysical effects often dominate (saturation, etc.),
such that periodic signals might have been detectable, all other things being
equal. We now have an unusually complete view of the rotation distribution in
the Pleiades. The relationship between $P$ and $(V-K_{\rm s})_0$ follows the
overall trends found in other Pleiades studies. There is a slowly rotating
sequence for $1.1\lesssim(V-K_{\rm s})_0\lesssim 3.7$, and a primarily rapidly
rotating population for $(V-K_{\rm s})_0\gtrsim 5.0$. There is a region in

that the memory performance of a noise-biased trapped-ion qubit memory can be
greatly improved by incorporating error correction of dephasing errors through
teleportation of the information between two repetition codes written on a pair

correction are often considerable, we show that our protocol can be achieved
with a single global entangling phase gate of remarkably low fidelity,
leveraging the fact that the gate errors are also dominated by dephasing-type

show that for realistic parameters our memory can exhibit error rates up to two

a useful means of improving memory performance in trapped ion systems where

understand better the angular momentum evolution and magnetic dynamos of young,
low mass stars. The K2 light curves provide not only rotational periods but
also detailed information from the shape of the phased light curve not
available in previous studies. A slowly rotating sequence begins at $(V-K_{\rm
s})_0\sim$1.1 (spectral type F5) and ends at $(V-K_{\rm s})_0\sim$ 3.7
(spectral type K8), with periods rising from $\sim$2 to $\sim$11 days in that
interval. Fifty-two percent of the Pleiades members in that color interval have
periods within 30\% of a curve defining the slow sequence; the slowly rotating
fraction decreases significantly redward of $(V-K_{\rm s})_0$=2.6. Nearly all
of the slow-sequence stars show light curves that evolve significantly on
timescales less than the K2 campaign duration. The majority of the FGK Pleiades
members identified as photometric binaries are relatively rapidly rotating,
perhaps because binarity inhibits star-disk angular momentum loss mechanisms
during pre-main sequence evolution. The fully convective, late M dwarf Pleiades
members (5.0 $<(V-K_{\rm s})_0<$ 6.0) nearly always show stable light curves,
with little spot evolution or evidence of differential rotation. During PMS
evolution from $\sim$3 Myr (NGC2264 age) to $\sim$125 Myr (Pleiades age), stars
of 0.3 $M_{\odot}$ shed about half their angular momentum, with the fractional
change in period between 3 and 125 Myr being nearly independent of mass for
fully convective stars. Our data also suggest that very low mass binaries form
with rotation periods more similar to each other and faster than would be true
if drawn at random from the parent population of single stars.

the charge distribution in graphene-substrate systems using Raman spectroscopy.
The influence of the substrate plasmons on the longitudinal optical phonons of

reveals the formation of a capacitance between the graphene and the substrate.
Thus, we give for the first time direct evidence that the excess negative

substrate without initial doping. This induced a previously unseen
redistribution of the charge-carrier density at the substrate-graphene
interface. There a quantum capacitor appears, without resorting to any
intentional external doping, as is fundamentally required for epitaxial
graphene. Although we have determined the electric field existing inside the
capacitor and revealed the presence of a minigap ($\approx 4.3meV$) for
epitaxial graphene on $4H$-$SiC$ face terminated carbon, it remains small in

exoplanetary host characterization; stellar monitoring campaigns; tomographic
mapping of the interstellar and intergalactic media; the in-situ chemical
tagging of the distant Galaxy; connecting galaxies to the large scale structure
of the Universe; measuring the mass functions of cold dark matter sub-halos in

requirement for the implementation of a universal quantum computer. The next
stage in this quest is the realization of quantum error correction codes, which
will mitigate the impact of faulty quantum information on a quantum computer.
Architectures with ten or more quantum bits (qubits) have been realized using
trapped ions and superconducting circuits. While these implementations are
potentially scalable, true scalability will require systems engineering to
combine quantum and classical hardware. One technology demanding imminent
efforts is the realization of a suitable wiring method for the control and
measurement of a large number of qubits. In this work, we introduce an
interconnect solution for solid-state qubits: The quantum socket. The quantum
socket fully exploits the third dimension to connect classical electronics to
qubits with higher density and better performance than two-dimensional methods
based on wire bonding. The quantum socket is based on spring-mounted micro
wires the three-dimensional wires that push directly on a micro-fabricated
chip, making electrical contact. A small wire cross section (~1 mmm), nearly
non-magnetic components, and functionality at low temperatures make the quantum
socket ideal to operate solid-state qubits. The wires have a coaxial geometry
and operate over a frequency range from DC to 8 GHz, with a contact resistance
of ~150 mohm, an impedance mismatch of ~10 ohm, and minimal crosstalk. As a
proof of principle, we fabricated and used a quantum socket to measure
superconducting resonators at a temperature of ~10 mK.

dimensional substrate where the driving force is applied either parallel or
perpendicular to the substrate periodicity direction. For perpendicular
driving, the particles in a purely overdamped system simply slide along the
substrate minima; however, for skyrmions where the Magnus force is relevant, we
find that a rich variety of dynamics can arise. In the single skyrmion limit,
the skyrmion motion is locked along the driving or longitudinal direction for
low drives, while at higher drives a transition occurs to a state in which the
skyrmion moves both transverse and longitudinal to the driving direction.
Within the longitudinally locked phase we find a pronounced speed up effect
that occurs when the Magnus force aligns with the external driving force, while
at the transition to transverse and longitudinal motion, the skyrmion velocity
drops, producing negative differential conductivity. For collectively
interacting skyrmion assemblies, the speed up effect is still present and we
observe a number of distinct dynamical phases, including a sliding smectic
phase, a disordered or moving liquid phase, a moving hexatic phase, and a
moving crystal phase. The transitions between the dynamic phases produce
distinct features in the structure of the skyrmion lattice and in the
velocity-force curves. We map these different phases as a function of the ratio
of the Magnus term to the dissipative term, the substrate strength, the
commensurability ratio, and the magnitude of the driving force.

form of probabilistic programs. We formulate a Bayesian approach to this
problem by specifying a grammar-based prior over probabilistic program code. We
use an approximate Bayesian computation method to learn the programs, whose
executions generate samples that statistically match observed data or
analytical characteristics of distributions of interest. In our experiments we
leverage different probabilistic programming systems to perform Markov chain
Monte Carlo sampling over the space of programs. Experimental results have
demonstrated that, using the proposed methodology, we can learn approximate and
even some exact samplers. Finally, we show that our results are competitive
with regard to genetic programming methods.

inference in probabilistic programming using data-driven proposals. In
particular, we develop a distance-based proposal for the non-parametric

concurrently bringing together the main ingredients for realizing many-body
phenomena in a single experimental platform is a major challenge. Using
superconducting qubits, we simultaneously realize synthetic magnetic fields and
strong particle interactions, which are among the essential elements for
studying quantum magnetism and fractional quantum Hall (FQH) phenomena. The
artificial magnetic fields are synthesized by sinusoidally modulating the qubit

directional circulation of photons, a signature of broken time-reversal
symmetry. We demonstrate strong interactions via the creation of
photon-vacancies, or ""holes"", which circulate in the opposite direction. The
combination of these key elements results in chiral groundstate currents, the
first direct measurement of persistent currents in low-lying eigenstates of
strongly interacting bosons. The observation of chiral currents at such a small
scale is interesting and suggests that the rich many-body physics could survive

sky, with a bow shock morphology. The identification of its exciting source has
remained uncertain over the years. A non-thermal radio source located at the
core of the shock structure was proposed to be the exciting source. However,
Very Large Array studies showed that the radio source has a clear morphology of
radio galaxy and a lack of flux variations or proper motions, favoring an
extragalactic origin. Recently, an optical-IR study proposed that this giant HH
object is driven by the multiple stellar system V380 Ori, located about 23$'$
to the SE of HH 222. The exciting sources of HH systems are usually detected as
weak free-free emitters at centimeter wavelengths. Here we report the detection
of an elongated radio source associated with the Herbig Be star or with its
close infrared companion in the multiple V380 Ori system. This radio source has
the characteristics of a thermal radio jet and is aligned with the direction of
the giant outflow defined by HH~222 and its suggested counterpart to the SE,
HH~1041. We propose that this radio jet traces the origin of the large scale HH
outflow. Assuming that the jet arises from the Herbig Be star, the radio
luminosity is a few times smaller than the value expected from the
radio-bolometric correlation for radio jets, confirming that this is a more
evolved object than those used to establish the correlation.

possible explosion mechanism for Type Ia supernovae in the single-degenerate
evolution channel. Driven by buoyancy, a deflagration flame rises in a narrow
cone towards the surface. For the most part, the flow of the expanding ashes
remains radial, but upon reaching the outer, low-pressure layers of the white
dwarf, an additional lateral component develops. This makes the deflagration
ashes converge again at the opposite side, where the compression heats fuel and
a detonation may be launched. To test the GCD explosion model, we perform a 3D
simulation for a model with an ignition spot offset near the upper limit of
what is still justifiable, 200 km. This simulation meets our deliberately
optimistic detonation criteria and we initiate a detonation. The detonation
burns through the white dwarf and leads to its complete disruption. We
determine nucleosynthetic yields by post-processing 10^6 tracer particles with
a 384 nuclide reaction network and we present multi-band light curves and
time-dependent optical spectra. We find that our synthetic observables show a
prominent viewing-angle sensitivity in UV and blue bands, which is in tension
with observed SNe Ia. The strong dependence on viewing-angle is caused by the
asymmetric distribution of the deflagration ashes in the outer ejecta layers.
Finally, we perform a comparison of our model to SN 1991T. The overall
flux-level of the model is slightly too low and the model predicts pre-maximum
light spectral features due to Ca, S, and Si that are too strong. Furthermore,
the model chemical abundance stratification qualitatively disagrees with recent
abundance tomography results in two key areas: our model lacks low velocity
stable Fe and instead has copious amounts of high-velocity 56Ni and stable Fe.
We therefore do not find good agreement of the model with SN 1991T.

allows integrated regressors and trends as well as stationary regressors. The
null hypothesis is that breaks in different parameters occur at common
locations and are separated by some positive fraction of the sample size unless
they occur across different equations. Under the alternative hypothesis, the
break dates across parameters are not the same and also need not be separated
by a positive fraction of the sample size whether within or across equations.
The test considered is the quasi-likelihood ratio test assuming normal errors,
though as usual the limit distribution of the test remains valid with
non-normal errors. Of independent interest, we provide results about the rate
of convergence of the estimates when searching over all possible partitions
subject only to the requirement that each regime contains at least as many
observations as some positive fraction of the sample size, allowing break dates
not separated by a positive fraction of the sample size across equations.
Simulations show that the test has good finite sample properties. We also
provide an application to issues related to level shifts and persistence for
various measures of inflation to illustrate its usefulness.

run time system, which abstracts the complexity of managing multiple
simulations. ExTASY supports the use of existing highly-optimised parallel MD
code and their coupling to analysis tools based upon collective coordinates
which do not require a priori knowledge of the system to bias. We describe two
workflows which both couple large ""ensembles"" of relatively short MD
simulations with analysis tools to automatically analyse the generated
trajectories and identify molecular conformational structures that will be used
on-the-fly as new starting points for further ""simulation-analysis"" iterations.
One of the workflows leverages the Locally Scaled Diffusion Maps technique; the
other makes use of Complementary Coordinates techniques to enhance sampling and
generate start-points for the next generation of MD simulations. We show that
the ExTASY tools have been deployed on a range of HPC systems including ARCHER
(Cray CX30), Blue Waters (Cray XE6/XK7), and Stampede (Linux cluster), and that
good strong scaling can be obtained up to 1000s of MD simulations, independent
of the size of each simulation. We discuss how ExTASY can be easily extended or
modified by end-users to build their own workflows, and ongoing work to improve
the usability and robustness of ExTASY.

tetraquarks with three light flavors using flavor $SU(3)$ symmetry. States with
three different light quarks must be in a ${\bf \bar 6 }$ or a ${\bf 15}$
multiplet. We investigate the production of charmed tetraquarks $X_c$ in $B\to

studying various tetraquark $B$ and $B_c$ decays. We demonstrate that the decay

composed by a $D$-dimensional Reissner-Nordstr\""{o}m-anti-de Sitter (RN-AdS)
black hole and a reflecting mirror under charged scalar perturbations are
presented in the linear regime. It is found that the stability of the system is
heavily affected by the mirror radius as well as the mass of the scalar
perturbation, AdS radius and the dimension of space-time. In a higher
dimensional space-time, the degree of instability of the superradiant modes
will be severely weakened. Nevertheless, the degree of instability can be
magnified significantly by choosing a suitable value of the mirror radius.
Remarkably, when the mirror radius is smaller than a threshold value the system
becomes stable. We also find that massive charged scalar fields cannot trigger
the instabilities in the background of $D$-dimensional asymptotically flat RN
black hole. For a given scalar charge, a small RN-AdS black hole can be
superradiantly unstable, while a large one may be always stable under charged
scalar field with or without a reflecting mirror. We also show that these
results can be easily expounded and understood with the help of factorized
potential analysis.

repeatable manner is limited by a finite repertoire of pre-evolved adaptive
responses. Beyond this capacity, cells can use exploratory dynamics to cope
with a much broader array of conditions. However, the process of adaptation by
exploratory dynamics within the lifetime of a cell is not well understood. Here
we demonstrate the feasibility of exploratory adaptation in a high-dimensional
network model of gene regulation. Exploration is initiated by failure to comply
with a constraint and is implemented by random sampling of network
configurations. It ceases if and when the network reaches a stable state
satisfying the constraint. We find that successful convergence (adaptation) in
high dimensions requires outgoing network hubs and is enhanced by their
auto-regulation. The ability of these empirically-validated features of gene
regulatory networks to support exploratory adaptation without fine-tuning,
makes it plausible for biological implementation.

The nucleon densities of the RMF theory contradict to knowledge about

factorizes into non-negative factors $\mathbf{A}$ ($L \times m$) and
$\mathbf{W}$ ($m \times K$). This insight enables us to propose an
$\epsilon$-greedy NMF-Bandit algorithm that designs a sequence of interventions
(selecting specific arms), that achieves a balance between learning this
low-dimensional structure and selecting the best arm to minimize regret. Our
algorithm achieves a regret of $\mathcal{O}\left(L\mathrm{poly}(m, \log K) \log

contextual bandits, assuming a constant gap between the best arm and the rest

conditions on the factors that are weaker versions of the well-known
Statistical RIP condition. We further propose a class of generative models that
satisfy our sufficient conditions, and derive a lower bound of
$\mathcal{O}\left(Km\log T\right)$. These are the first regret guarantees for

animals that gradually learns from easy to hard samples. One key issue in SPL
is to obtain better weighting strategy that is determined by minimizer
function. Existing methods usually pursue this by artificially designing the
explicit form of SPL regularizer. In this paper, we focus on the minimizer
function, and study a group of new regularizer, named self-paced implicit
regularizer that is deduced from robust loss function. Based on the convex
conjugacy theory, the minimizer function for self-paced implicit regularizer
can be directly learned from the latent loss function, while the analytic form
of the regularizer can be even known. A general framework (named SPL-IR) for
SPL is developed accordingly. We demonstrate that the learning procedure of
SPL-IR is associated with latent robust loss functions, thus can provide some
theoretical inspirations for its working mechanism. We further analyze the
relation between SPL-IR and half-quadratic optimization. Finally, we implement
SPL-IR to both supervised and unsupervised tasks, and experimental results

subgroup is a quasi--convex subset of a set in this collection and that the
Morse boundary is recovered as the direct limit of the usual Gromov boundaries
of these hyperbolic subspaces.

dimension of a stable subset; and the Morse capacity dimension, which naturally
generalises Buyalo's capacity dimension for boundaries of hyperbolic spaces.
  We prove that every stable subset of a right--angled Artin group is
quasi--isometric to a tree; and that the stable dimension of a mapping class
group is bounded from above by a multiple of the complexity of the surface. In
the case of relatively hyperbolic groups we show that finite stable dimension
is inherited from peripheral subgroups.

Measurements of the electrical resistance and magnetic susceptibility, both at
ambient and finite pressure $P$ $\leq$ 2$\,$GPa, were performed on
Ca$_{1-x}$Sr$_x$Fe$_2$As$_2$ single crystals grown out of Sn flux. We find that
upon Sr substitution the ranges of stability of both the structural-magnetic
transition and the transition into the non-magnetic collapsed tetragonal phase
are shifted to higher pressure levels with the latter moving at a higher rate.
This suggests the possibility of separating the two phase lines, which
intersect already at elevated temperatures for $x$ = 0 and low Sr concentration
levels. For $x$ = 0.177 we find strong evidence that both phases remain
separated down to lowest temperature and that a zero-resistance state emerges
in this intermediate pressure window. This observation indicates that
Sr-substitution combined with hydrostatic pressure provides another route for
stabilizing superconductivity in CaFe$_2$As$_2$. Our results are consistent
with the notion that (i) preserving the fluctuations associated with the
structural-magnetic transition to low temperatures is vital for
superconductivity to form in this material and that (ii) the non-magnetic
collapsed tetragonal phase is detrimental for superconductivity.

established under various conditions, some of which are difficult to verify in
practice. In this paper, we study model selection from the perspective of
generalization ability, under the framework of structural risk minimization
(SRM) and Vapnik-Chervonenkis (VC) theory. The approach emphasizes the balance
between the in-sample and out-of-sample fit, which can be achieved by using
cross-validation to select a penalty on model complexity. We show that an exact
relationship exists between the generalization ability of a model and model
selection consistency. By implementing SRM and the VC inequality, we show that
Lasso is L2-consistent for model selection under assumptions similar to those
imposed on OLS. Furthermore, we derive a probabilistic bound for the distance
between the penalized extremum estimator and the extremum estimator without
penalty, which is dominated by overfitting. We also propose a new measurement
of overfitting, GR2, based on generalization ability, that converges to zero if
model selection is consistent. Using simulations, we demonstrate that the

  presentation",,,,"q-bio.NC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Linear-nonlinear transforms are interesting in vision science because they
are key in modeling a number of perceptual experiences such as color, motion or
spatial texture. Here we first show that a number of issues in vision may be
addressed through an analytic expression of the Jacobian of these
linear-nonlinear transforms. The particular model analyzed afterwards (an
extension of [Malo & Simoncelli SPIE 2015]) is illustrative because it consists
of a cascade of standard linear-nonlinear modules. Each module roughly
corresponds to a known psychophysical mechanism: (1) linear spectral
integration and nonlinear brightness-from-luminance computation, (2) linear
pooling of local brightness and nonlinear normalization for local contrast
computation, (3) linear frequency selectivity and nonlinear normalization for
spatial contrast masking, and (4) linear wavelet-like decomposition and
nonlinear normalization for frequency-dependent masking. Beyond being the
appropriate technical report with the missing details in [Malo & Simoncelli
SPIE 2015], the interest of the presented analytic results and numerical
methods transcend the particular model because of the ubiquity of the
linear-nonlinear structure. Part of this material was presented at MODVIS 2016

camera localization, but its use is frequently limited to a single marker, or

a scarcely treated problem in favour of keypoint-based approaches. However,
while keypoint detectors are not robust to rapid motion, large changes in

novel method to simultaneously solve the problems of mapping and localization
from a set of squared planar markers. First, a quiver of pairwise relative
marker poses is created, from which an initial pose graph is obtained. The pose
graph may contain small pairwise pose errors, that when propagated, leads to
large errors. Thus, we distribute the rotational and translational error along
the basis cycles of the graph so as to obtain a corrected pose graph. Finally,
we perform a global pose optimization by minimizing the reprojection errors of
the planar markers in all observed frames. The experiments conducted show that
our method performs better than Structure from Motion and visual SLAM

However, current altmetric indicators were extrapolated from traditional

In contrast, established qualitative methodologies for societal impact
assessment are based on interaction approaches. These argue that assessment
should focus on mapping the contexts in which engagement among researchers and
stakeholders take place, as a means to understand the pathways to societal
impact. Following these approaches, we propose to shift the use of altmetric

illustrates the potential of Twitter networks to capture disparate degrees of

superdiffusion or normal diffusion when $p_n$ is distributed as a power law. We
also introduce waiting times that are power-law distributed as well and
therefore the probability distribution scaling is steered by the two PDF's

and distances for 4d and 5d metals in graphene show similar trends for the
later groups in the periodic table, which is also well-known characteristic of
3d elements. However, along earlier groups the 4d impurities in graphene show
very similar binding energies, distances and magnetic moments to 5d ones, which
can be related to the influence of the 4d and 5d lanthanide contraction.
Surprisingly, within the manganese group, the total magnetic moment of
3$\mu_{B}$ for manganese is reduced to 1$\mu_{B}$ for technetium and rhenium.
We find that with compared with 3d elements, the larger size of the 4d and 5d
elements causes a high degree hybridization with the neighbouring carbon atoms,
reducing spin splitting in the d levels. It seems that the magnetic adjustment
of graphene could be significantly different is 4d or 5d impurities are used

olivine-bearing chondrules in the Sahara 97096 (EH3) enstatite chondrite. Most
olivine and enstatite present rare earth element (REE) patterns comparable to
their counterparts in type I chondrules in ordinary chondrites. They thus
likely share a similar igneous origin, likely under similar redox conditions.
The mesostasis however frequently shows negative Eu and/or Yb (and more rarely
Sm) anomalies, evidently out of equilibrium with olivine and enstatite. We
suggest that this reflects crystallization of oldhamite during a sulfidation
event, already inferred by others, during which the mesostasis was molten,
where the complementary positive Eu and Yb anomalies exhibited by oldhamite
would have possibly arisen due to a divalent state of these elements. Much of
this igneous oldhamite would have been expelled from the chondrules, presumably
by inertial acceleration or surface tension effects, and would have contributed
to the high abundance of opaque nodules found outside them in EH chondrites. In
two chondrules, olivine and enstatite exhibit negatively sloped REE patterns,
which may be an extreme manifestation of a general phenomenon (possibly linked
to near-liquidus partitioning) underlying the overabundance of light REE
observed in most chondrule silicates relative to equilibrium predictions. The
silicate phases in one of these two chondrules show complementary Eu, Yb and Sm
anomalies providing direct evidence for the postulated occurrence of the
divalent state for these elements at some stage in the formation reservoir of
enstatite chondrites. Our work supports the idea that the peculiarities of
enstatite chondrites may not require a condensation sequence at high C/O ratios

Learning to hash is one of the major solutions to this problem and has been
widely studied recently. In this paper, we present a comprehensive survey of
the learning to hash algorithms, categorize them according to the manners of
preserving the similarities into: pairwise similarity preserving, multiwise
similarity preserving, implicit similarity preserving, as well as quantization,
and discuss their relations. We separate quantization from pairwise similarity
preserving as the objective function is very different though quantization, as
we show, can be derived from preserving the pairwise similarities. In addition,
we present the evaluation protocols, and the general performance analysis, and
point out that the quantization algorithms perform superiorly in terms of
search accuracy, search time cost, and space cost. Finally, we introduce a few

ability to learn text transformations from erroneous to corrected text, without
explicitly modeling error types. However, phrase-based SMT systems suffer from
limitations of discrete word representation, linear mapping, and lack of global
context. In this paper, we address these limitations by using two different yet
complementary neural network models, namely a neural network global lexicon
model and a neural network joint model. These neural networks can generalize
better by using continuous space representation of words and learn non-linear
mappings. Moreover, they can leverage contextual information from the source
sentence more effectively. By adding these two components, we achieve
statistically significant improvement in accuracy for grammatical error

perceptions about natural phenomena were necessary, the entire system of basic
concepts in classical physics had to be abandoned and replaced by a new mode of
thought. Continuity and determinism of classical laws were no longer applicable
on the quantum scale, where dynamical behaviour proceeds by discontinuous and
statistical quantum transitions. Albert Einstein laid the essential foundations
for the new concept; Max Born made the decisive step further leading to the

NuSTAR. We were able to well constrain the lag spectrum with respect to the
softest (0.3--2.3 keV) band: the delay shows increasing lag values reaching a
maximum delay of $\sim$ 12 ms, between 6 and 6.4 keV. After this maximum, the
value of the hard lag drops to 7 ms, followed by a recovery to a plateau at 9
ms for energies above 8 keV. NuSTAR data confirm this trend up to 30 keV, but
the measurements are statistically poorer, and therefore, less constraining.
The lag-energy pattern up to the discontinuity is well described by a
logarithmic function. Assuming this is due to a Compton reverberation
mechanism, we derive a size for the Compton cloud $R_{\rm{cc}}$ $\sim$ 120
$R_{\rm g}$, consistent with previous estimates on the magnetospheric radius.
In this scenario, the sharp discontinuity at $\sim$ 6.5 keV appears difficult
to interpret and suggests the possible influence of the reflected component in
this energy range. We therefore propose the possible coexistence of both
Compton and disk reverberation to explain the scale of the lags and its energy
dependence.

nonseparability. It has since been shown that this is not the case: the need
for trust, in verifying two parties share a given quantum correlation resource,
can be replaced by quantum refereeing, in which the referee sends quantum
signals rather than classical signals to untrusted parties. The existence of
such quantum-refereed games is discussed, with particular emphasis on how they
make it impossible for the parties to cheat. The example of a particular
quantum-refereed steering game is used to show explicitly how
measurement-device independence is achieved via `quantum programming' of
untrusted measurement devices; how cheating is prevented by the steered party
being unable to distinguish sufficiently well between two sets of nonorthogonal
signal states; and that cheating remains impossible when one-way communication
is allowed from the steered party to the unsteered party. This game has been
recently implemented experimentally, and is of particular interest both in
accounting for any imperfections in the referee's preparation of signal states,

peculiar diffraction patterns in good agreement with this assumption.
Therefore, the collective transport of charges in CDW systems may be due to a
nonlinear interaction leading to a self-localized excitation, carrying charges
without deformation through the sample, on top of the CDW ground state. This
single theory explains why charges remain spatially correlated over very long

  Optical polarimetry revealed small intrinsic polarization in HD 48099 with
0.1% peak to peak variation over the orbital period of 3.08 days. The
variability pattern is typical for binary systems, showing strong second
harmonic of the orbital period. We apply our model code for the electron
scattering in the circumstellar matter to put constraints on the system
geometry. A good model fit is obtained for scattering of light on a cloud
produced by the colliding stellar winds. The geometry of the cloud, with a
broad distribution of scattering particles away from the orbital plane, helps
in constraining the (low) orbital inclination. We derive from the polarization
data the inclination i = 17 deg +/- 2deg and the longitude of the ascending
node Omega = 82 deg +/- 1 deg of the binary orbit. The available X-ray data
provide additional evidence for the existence of the colliding stellar winds in
the system. Another possible source of the polarized light could be scattering
from the stellar photospheres. The models with circumstellar envelopes, or
matter confined to the orbital plane, do not provide good constraints on the

would give access to the full base station traffic at a 1 ms granularity, thus
allowing for traffic profiling and accurate measurements. Although a few
open-source implementations of LTE are available, they do not provide tools to
reliably decoding the LTE control channel and, thus, accessing the scheduling
information. In this paper, we present OWL, an Online Watcher for LTE that is
able to decode all the resource blocks in more than 99% of the system frames,
significantly outperforming existing non-commercial prior decoders. Compared to
previous attempts, OWL grounds the decoding procedure on information obtained
from the LTE random access mechanism. This makes it possible to run our
software on inexpensive hardware coupled with almost any software defined radio
capable of sampling the LTE signal with sufficient accuracy.

  networks","Accepted in Journal of Computational Electronics",,,,"cs.ET","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  New technologies such as Quantum-dot Cellular Automata (QCA), Single Electron
Tunneling (SET), Tunneling Phase Logic (TPL) and all-spin logic (ASL) devices
have been widely advocated in nanotechnology as a response to the physical
limits associated with complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS)
technology in atomic scales. Some of their peculiar features are their smaller
size, higher speed, higher switching frequency, lower power consumption, and
higher scale integration. In these technologies, the majority (or minority) and
inverter gates are employed for the production of the functions as this set of
gates makes a universal set of Boolean primitives in these technologies. An
important step in the generation of Boolean functions using the majority gate
is reducing the number of involved gates. In this paper, a multi-objective
synthesis methodology (with the objective priority of gate counts, gate levels
and the number of inverter gates) is presented for finding the minimal number
of possible majority gates in the synthesis of Boolean functions using the
proposed Majority Specification Matrix (MSM) concept. Moreover, based on MSM, a
synthesis flow is proposed for the synthesis of multi-output Boolean functions.
To reveal the efficiency of the proposed method, it is compared with a
meta-heuristic method, multi-objective Genetic Programing (GP). Besides, it is
applied to synthesize MCNC benchmark circuits. The results are indicative of
the outperformance of the proposed method in comparison to multi-objective GP
method. Also, for the MCNC benchmark circuits, there is an average reduction of
10.5% in the number of levels as well as 16.8% and 33.5% in the number of
majority and inverter gates, as compared to the best available method
respectively.

factorized, multipolar amplitude corrections $f_{\ell m}$ of the
effective-one-body (EOB) gravitational waveform of spinning, nonprecessing,
circularized, coalescing black hole binaries (BBHs). This stems from the
following two-step paradigm: (i) the factorization of the orbital
(spin-independent) terms in $f_{\ell m}$; (ii) the resummation of the residual
spin (or orbital) factors. We find that resumming the residual spin factor by
taking its inverse resummed (iResum) is an efficient way to obtain amplitudes
that are more accurate in the strong-field, fast-velocity regime. The
performance of the method is illustrated on the $\ell=2$ and $m=(1,2)$ waveform
multipoles, both for a test-mass orbiting around a Kerr black hole and for
comparable-mass BBHs. In the first case, the iResum $f_{\ell m}$'s are much
closer to the corresponding ""exact"" functions (obtained solving numerically the
Teukolsky equation) up to the light-ring, than the nonresummed ones, especially
when the black-hole spin is nearly extremal. The iResum paradigm is also more
efficient than including higher post-Newtonian terms (up to 20PN order): the
resummed 5PN information yields per se a rather good numerical/analytical
agreement at the last-stable-orbit, and a well-controlled behavior up to the
light-ring. For comparable mass binaries (including the highest PN-order
information available, 3.5PN), comparing EOB with Numerical Relativity (NR)
data shows that the analytical/numerical fractional disagreement at merger,
without NR-calibration of the EOB waveform, is generically reduced by iResum,
from a $40\%$ of the usual approach to just a few percents. This suggests that
EOBNR waveform models for coalescing BBHs may be improved using iResum
amplitudes.

dimensional spectral and spatial data. However, due to spectral and spatial
redundancy the true hyperspectral signal lies on a subspace of much lower
dimension than the original data. The identification of the signal subspace is
a very important first step for most hyperspectral algorithms. In this paper we
investigate the important problem of identifying the hyperspectral signal
subspace by minimizing the mean squared error (MSE) between the true signal and
an estimate of the signal. Since the MSE is uncomputable in practice, due to
its dependency on the true signal, we propose a method based on the Stein's
unbiased risk estimator (SURE) that provides an unbiased estimate of the MSE.
The resulting method is simple and fully automatic and we evaluate it using
both simulated and real hyperspectral data sets. Experimental results shows
that our proposed method compares well to recent state-of-the-art subspace
identification methods.

suspension in a process referred to as motility-induced phase separation. The
properties of the out-of-equilibrium structures that are formed are governed by
the specifics of the particle interactions and the strength of the activity.
Thus far, most studies into the formation of these structures have focused on
spherical colloids, dumbbells, and rod-like particles endowed with various
interaction potentials. Only a few studies have examined the collective
behavior of more complex particle shapes. Here, we increase the geometric
complexity and use Molecular Dynamics simulations to consider the structures
formed by triangular self-propelled particles with surface roughness. These
triangles either move towards their apex or towards their base, i.e., they
possess a polarity. We find that apex-directed triangles cluster more readily,
more stably, and have a smoother cluster interface than their base-directed
counterparts. A difference between the two polarities is in line with the
results of [H.H. Wensink, et al., Phys. Rev. E 89, 010302(R) (2014)], however,
we obtain the reversed result when it comes to clustering, namely that
apex-directed particles cluster more readily. We further show that reducing the
surface roughness negatively impacts the stability of the base-directed
structures, suggesting that their formation is in large part due to surface
roughness. Our results lay a solid foundation for future experimental and
computational studies into the effect of roughness on the collective dynamics

The X-ray light curves revealed a modulation with a frequency of ~0.75 mHz,
indicating that V4743 Sgr is most probably an intermediate polar (IP). The
X-ray spectra have characteristics in common with known IPs, with a hard
thermal plasma component that can be fitted only assuming a partially covering
absorber. In 2004 the X-ray spectrum had also a supersoft blackbody-like
component, whose temperature was close to that of the white dwarf (WD) in the
supersoft X-ray phase following the outburst, but with flux by at least two
orders of magnitude lower. In quiescent IPs, a soft X-ray flux component
originates at times in the polar regions irradiated by an accretion column, but
the supersoft component of V4743 Sgr disappeared in 2006, indicating a possible
origin different from accretion. We suggest that it may have been due to an
atmospheric temperature gradient on the WD surface, or to continuing localized
thermonuclear burning at the bottom of the envelope, before complete turn-off.
An optical spectrum obtained with SALT 11.5 years after the outburst showed a
prominent He II 4686A line and the Bowen blend, which reveal a very hot region,
but with peak temperature shifted to the ultraviolet (UV) range. V4743 Sgr is

sq arcmin of the Hubble Ultra Deep Field (HUDF) as previously imaged with
WFC3/IR on HST. Using a mosaic of 45 pointings, we have obtained a homogeneous
1.3mm image of the HUDF, achieving an rms sensitivity of 35 microJy, at a
resolution of 0.7 arcsec. From an initial list of ~50 >3.5sigma peaks, a
rigorous analysis confirms 16 sources with flux densities S(1.3) > 120 microJy.
All of these have secure galaxy counterparts with robust redshifts (<z> =
2.15), and 12 are also detected at 6GHz in new deep JVLA imaging. Due to the
wealth of supporting data in this unique field, the physical properties of the
ALMA sources are well constrained, including their stellar masses (M*) and
UV+FIR star-formation rates (SFR). Our results show that stellar mass is the
best predictor of SFR in the high-z Universe; indeed at z > 2 our ALMA sample
contains 7 of the 9 galaxies in the HUDF with M* > 2 x 10^10 Msun and we detect
only one galaxy at z > 3.5, reflecting the rapid drop-off of high-mass galaxies
with increasing redshift. The detections, coupled with stacking, allow us to
probe the redshift/mass distribution of the 1.3-mm background down to S(1.3) ~
10 micro-Jy. We find strong evidence for a steep `main sequence' for
star-forming galaxies at z ~ 2, with SFR \propto M* and a mean specific SFR =
2.2 /Gyr. Moreover, we find that ~85% of total star formation at z ~ 2 is
enshrouded in dust, with ~65% of all star formation at this epoch occurring in
high-mass galaxies (M* > 2 x 10^10 Msun), for which the average
obscured:unobscured SF ratio is ~200. Finally, we combine our new ALMA results
with the existing HST data to revisit the cosmic evolution of star-formation
rate density; we find that this peaks at z ~ 2.5, and that the star-forming
Universe transits from primarily unobscured to primarily obscured thereafter at
z ~ 4.

themselves to create the diversity we observe? What are the progenitors to
present-day galaxies? To answer these big questions, observations throughout
the Universe and the physical modelisation are obvious tools. But between
these, there is a key process, without which it would be impossible to extract
some digestible information from the complexity of these systems. This is
classification. One century ago, galaxies were discovered by Hubble. From
images obtained in the visible range of wavelengths, he synthetised his
observations through the usual process: classification. With only one parameter
(the shape) that is qualitative and determined with the eye, he found four
categories: ellipticals, spirals, barred spirals and irregulars. This is the
famous Hubble classification. He later hypothetized relationships between these
classes, building the Hubble Tuning Fork. The Hubble classification has been
refined, notably by de Vaucouleurs, and is still used as the only global
classification of galaxies. Even though the physical relationships proposed by
Hubble are not retained any more, the Hubble Tuning Fork is nearly always used
to represent the classification of the galaxy diversity under its new name the
Hubble sequence (e.g. Delgado-Serrano, 2012). Its success is impressive and can
be understood by its simplicity, even its beauty, and by the many correlations
found between the morphology of galaxies and their other properties. And one
must admit that there is no alternative up to now, even though both the Hubble
classification and diagram have been recognised to be unsatisfactory. Among the
most obvious flaws of this classification, one must mention its monovariate,
qualitative, subjective and old-fashioned nature, as well as the difficulty to
characterise the morphology of distant galaxies. The first two most significant
multivariate studies were by Watanabe et al. (1985) and Whitmore (1984). Since
the year 2005, the number of studies attempting to go beyond the Hubble
classification has increased largely. Why, despite of this, the Hubble
classification and its sequence are still alive and no alternative have yet
emerged (Sandage, 2005)? My feeling is that the results of the multivariate
analyses are not easily integrated into a one-century old practice of modeling
the observations. In addition, extragalactic objects like galaxies, stellar
clusters or stars do evolve. Astronomy now provides data on very distant
objects, raising the question of the relationships between those and our
present day nearby galaxies. Clearly, this is a phylogenetic problem.
Astrocladistics 1 aims at exploring the use of phylogenetic tools in
astrophysics (Fraix-Burnet et al., 2006a,b). We have proved that Maximum
Parsimony (or cladistics) can be applied in astrophysics and provides a new
exploration tool of the data (Fraix-Burnet et al., 2009, 2012, Cardone \&
Fraix-Burnet, 2013). As far as the classification of galaxies is concerned, a
larger number of objects must now be analysed. In this paper, I

these requirements providing unusual physical properties due to the coexistence
and coupling between ferromagnetic and ferroelectric order in one and the same
system. Here we show that multiferroic (GeMn)Te inherits from its parent
ferroelectric {\alpha}-GeTe compound a giant Rashba splitting of
three-dimensional bulk states which competes with the Zeeman spin splitting
induced by the magnetic exchange interactions. The collinear alignment of
ferroelectric and ferromagnetic polarization leads to an opening of a tunable
Zeeman gap of up to 100 meV around the Dirac point of the Rashba bands, coupled
with a change in spin texture by entanglement of magnetic and spin-orbit order.
Through applications of magnetic fields, we demonstrate manipulation of spin-
texture by spin resolved photoemission experiments, which is also expected for
electric fields based on the multiferroic coupling. The control of spin
helicity of the bands and its locking to ferromagnetic and ferroelectric order
opens fascinating new avenues for highly multifunctional multiferroic Rashba
devices suited for reprogrammable logic and/or nonvolatile memory applications.

Contrary to topological insulators, the impurities are effectively screened in

such that theoretical predictions on the potential impact of Fermi arcs can be
unambiguously scrutinized. Our analysis reveals the existence of three
extremely short, previously unknown scattering vectors. Comparison with theory
traces them back to scattering events between large parallel segments of
spin-split trivial states, strongly limiting their coherence. In sharp contrast
to previous work [R. Batabyal et al., Sci. Adv. 2, e1600709 (2016)], where
similar but weaker subtle modulations were interpreted as evidence of
quasiparticle interference originating from Femi arcs, we can safely exclude
this being the case. Overall, our results indicate that intra- as well as
inter-Fermi arc scattering are strongly suppressed and may explain why-in spite
of their complex multiband structure-transport measurements show signatures of

Assuming a weak perturbation by the advection term and using projection method,
in a second step, an equation of motion for traveling waves within such tubes
can be derived. Both methods predict properly the nonlinear dependence of the
propagation velocity on the ratio of the modulation period of the geometry to
the intrinsic width of the front, or pulse. As a main feature, we can observe
finite intervals of propagation failure of waves induced by the tube's
modulation. In addition, using the Fick-Jacobs approach for the highly

effective diffusion coefficient. Furthermore, we discuss the effects of a
single bottleneck on the period of pulse trains within tubes. We observe period

not allow for exact calculations. In this paper we propose a generalisation of
the block bootstrap methodology, relate it to the existing optimisation
procedures and apply it to a temperature data set. Our other focus is on
statistical tests, where quite often the actual sample size plays an important
role, even in case of relatively large samples. This is especially the case for
copulas. These are used for investigating the dependencies among data sets. As
in quite a few real applications the time dependence cannot be neglected, we
investigated the effect of this phenomenon to the used test statistic. The
critical values can be computed by the proposed new block bootstrap simulation,
where the block sizes are determined e.g. by fitting a VAR model to the
observations. The results are illustrated for models of the used temperature

we propose an abstract gradient-type method, and then derive EB conditions that

unified framework that not only allows us to find new connections between many
existing EB conditions, but also paves a way to construct new EB conditions.
The latter allows us to claim the weakest conditions guaranteeing linear
convergence for a number of fundamental algorithms, including the gradient

algorithm. In addition, we show linear convergence for the proximal alternating
linearized minimization algorithm under a group of equivalent EB conditions,

  Methods.We use the wavelet technique to decompose both the gamma ray and dust
opacity maps in different scales, then we calculate the wavelet cross
correlation functions in these scales. We also define wavelet response as an
analog to the impulsive response in Fourier transform and calculate that in
different scales down to Fermi angular resolution.
  Results. The gamma ray maps above 2 GeV show strong correlation with the dust
opacity maps, the correlation coefficient is larger than 0.9 above a scale of
0.4 degree.The derived wavelet response is uniform in different scales.

mean-field wave functions connected with the short-distance behavior of the
nucleon-nucleon interaction. These SRCs provide corrections to lepton- nucleus
cross sections as computed in the impulse approximation (IA). Purpose: We want
to investigate the influence of SRCs on the one-nucleon (1N) and two-nucleon
(2N) knockout channel for muon-neutrino induced processes on a $^{12}$C target
at energies relevant for contemporary measurements. Method: The model adopted
in this work, corrects the impulse approximation for SRCs by shifting the com-
plexity induced by the SRCs from the wave functions to the operators. Due to
the local character of the SRCs, it is argued that the expansion of these
operators can be truncated at a low order. Results: The model is compared with
electron-scattering data, and two-particle two-hole responses are presented for
neutrino scattering. The contributions from the vector and axial-vector parts
of the nuclear current as well as the central, tensor and spin-isospin part of
the SRCs are studied. Conclusions: Nuclear SRCs affect the 1N knockout channel
and give rise to 2N knockout. The exclusive neutrino-induced 2N knockout cross
section of SRC pairs is shown and the 2N knockout contribution to the QE signal
is calculated. The strength occurs as a broad background which extends into the
dip region.

When an accurate model of a listener's morphology exists, HRTFs can be

general recommendation to model the head and pinnae with at least six elements
per wavelength renders the BEM as a time-consuming procedure when calculating
HRTFs for the full audible frequency range. In this study, a mesh preprocessing
algorithm is proposed, viz., a-priori mesh grading, which reduces the

grading algorithm deliberately violates the recommendation of at least six

the size of elements gradually according to an a-priori defined grading
function. The evaluation of the algorithm involved HRTFs calculated for various
geometric objects including meshes of three human listeners and various grading
functions. The numerical accuracy and the predicted sound-localization
performance of calculated HRTFs were analyzed. A-priori mesh grading appeared

single-label classification, few studies have been done in multi-label ZSL,
where an instance is associated with a set of labels simultaneously, due to the
difficulty in modeling complex semantics conveyed by a set of labels. In this
paper, we propose a novel approach to multi-label ZSL via concept embedding
learned from collections of public users' annotations of multimedia. Thanks to
concept embedding, multi-label ZSL can be done by efficiently mapping an
instance input features onto the concept embedding space in a similar manner
used in single-label ZSL. Moreover, our semantic learning model is capable of
embedding an out-of-vocabulary label by inferring its meaning from its
co-occurring labels. Thus, our approach allows both seen and unseen labels
during the concept embedding learning to be used in the aforementioned instance
mapping, which makes multi-label ZSL more flexible and suitable for real
applications. Experimental results of multi-label ZSL on images and music

from radio observations of the nearby Universe. Until the next generation of
instruments allow us to push to much higher redshifts, we must rely mostly upon
theoretical models of galaxy formation to provide us with key insights into the
likely cosmic evolution of HI in the Universe, and its links to molecular
clouds and star formation. In this work, we present a new set of methods to
convert mock galaxy catalogues into synthetic data cubes containing model
galaxies with realistic spatial and spectral HI distributions over large
cosmological volumes. Such synthetic data products can be used to guide
observing and data handling/analysis strategies for forthcoming HI galaxy
surveys. As a demonstration of the potential use of our simulated products we
use them to conduct several mock HI stacking experiments for both low and
high-redshift galaxy samples. The stacked spectra can be accurately decomposed
into contributions from target and non-target galaxies, revealing in all
co-added spectra large fractions of contaminant mass due to source confusion.
Our results are consistent with similar estimates extrapolated from z=0
observational data. The amount of confused mass in a stacked spectrum grows
almost linearly with the size of the observational beam, suggesting potential
over-estimates of Omega_HI by some recent HI stacking experiments. Our

line region (BLR) and the narrow line region (NLR) in some AGN can be fully
explained by an increase of the gas density in the emitting region. Our model
predicts the formation of the intermediate line region (ILR) that is observed
in some Seyfert galaxies by the detection of emission lines with intermediate
velocity full width half maximum (FWHM) $\sim$ 700 - 1200 km s$^{-1}$. These
lines are believed to be originating from an ILR located somewhere between the
BLR and NLR. As it was previously proved, the apparent gap is assumed to be
caused by the presence of dust beyond the sublimation radius. Our computations
with the use of {\sc cloudy} photoionization code, show that the differences in
the shape of spectral energy distribution (SED) from the central region of AGN,
do not diminish the apparent gap in the line emission in those objects. A
strong discontinuity in the line emission vs radius exists for all lines at the
dust sublimation radius. However, increasing the gas density to $\sim$
10$^{11.5}$ cm$^{-3}$ at the sublimation radius provides the continuous line
emission vs radius and fully explains the recently observed lack of apparent
gap in some AGN. We show that such a high density is consistent with the
density of upper layers of an accretion disk atmosphere. Therefore, the upper
layers of the disk atmosphere can give rise to the formation of observed
emission line clouds.

multi-robot adversarial environments, due to their high dynamism and the
partial observability of the environment. In this paper we introduce a method
based on a combination of Monte Carlo search and data aggregation (MCSDA) to
adapt discrete-action soccer policies for a defender robot to the strategy of
the opponent team. By exploiting a simple representation of the domain, a
supervised learning algorithm is trained over an initial collection of data
consisting of several simulations of human expert policies. Monte Carlo policy
rollouts are then generated and aggregated to previous data to improve the
learned policy over multiple epochs and games. The proposed approach has been
extensively tested both on a soccer-dedicated simulator and on real robots.
Using this method, our learning robot soccer team achieves an improvement in
ball interceptions, as well as a reduction in the number of opponents' goals.
Together with a better performance, an overall more efficient positioning of
the whole team within the field is achieved.

of light-matter interaction. The coherent perfect absorption (CPA) phenomenon
extends to the general multibeam interference phenomenology the well known
critical coupling concepts. This interferometric control of absorption can be
employed to reach full delivery of optical energy to nanoscale systems such as
plasmonic nanoparticles, and multi-port interference can be used to enhance the
absorption of a nanoscale device when it is embedded in a strongly scattering
system, with potential applications to nanoscale sensing. Here we review the
two-port CPA in reference to photonic structures which can resonantly couple to
the external fields. A revised two-port theory of CPA is illustrated, which
relies on the Scattering Matrix formalism and is valid for all linear two-port
systems with reciprocity. Through a semiclassical approach, treating two-port
critical coupling conditions in a non-perturbative regime, it is demonstrated
that the strong coupling regime and the critical coupling condition can indeed
coexist; in this situation, termed strong critical coupling, all the incoming
energy is converted into polaritons. Experimental results are presented, which
clearly display the elliptical trace of absorption as function of input
unbalance in a thin metallo-dielectric metamaterial, and verify polaritonic CPA
in an intersubband-polariton photonic-crystal membrane resonator. Concluding
remarks discuss the future perspectives of CPA with photonic structures.

define associations between miRNAs and diseases in terms of their vector

emission mechanism producing the $\gamma$-rays. Previous estimates of the
kinetic energy of the blast waves, based on the X-ray afterglow luminosity
$L_X$, suggested that this efficiency is large, with values above 90\% in some
cases. This poses a problem to emission mechanisms and in particular to the
internal shocks model. These estimates are based, however, on the assumption
that the X-ray emitting electrons are fast cooling and that their Inverse
Compton (IC) losses are negligible. The observed correlations between $L_X$
(and hence the blast wave energy) and $E_{\gamma\rm ,iso}$, the isotropic
equivalent energy in the prompt emission, has been considered as observational
evidence supporting this analysis. It is reasonable that the prompt gamma-ray
energy and the blast wave kinetic energy are correlated and the observed
correlation corroborates, therefore, the notion $L_X$ is indeed a valid proxy
for the latter. Recent findings suggest that the magnetic field in the
afterglow shocks is significantly weaker than was earlier thought and its
equipartition fraction, $\epsilon_B$, could be as low as $10^{-4}$ or even
lower. Motivated by these findings we reconsider the problem, taking now IC
cooling into account. We find that the observed $L_X-E_{\gamma\rm ,iso}$
correlation is recovered also when IC losses are significant. For small
$\epsilon_B$ values the blast wave must be more energetic and we find that the
corresponding prompt efficiency is significantly smaller than previously
thought. For example, for $\epsilon_B\sim10^{-4}$ we infer a typical prompt
efficiency of $\sim15\%$.

finite time horizon and the specification of terminal conditions can generate a
host of metastable solutions obeying \textit{second-order} dynamics. We show
that these solutions are governed by a Newtonian-like dynamics in discrete time
which permits solutions in terms of both the first order relaxation (""forward"")

us to classify trajectories for a given final magnetization as stable or

adult-directed speech (ADS). Why it has these properties -- and whether they
are intended to facilitate language learning -- is matter of contention. We
argue that much of this disagreement stems from lack of a formal, guiding
theory of how phonetic categories should best be taught to infant-like
learners. In the absence of such a theory, researchers have relied on
intuitions about learning to guide the argument. We use a formal theory of
teaching, validated through experiments in other domains, as the basis for a
detailed analysis of whether IDS is well-designed for teaching phonetic
categories. Using the theory, we generate ideal data for teaching phonetic
categories in English. We qualitatively compare the simulated teaching data
with human IDS, finding that the teaching data exhibit many features of IDS,
including some that have been taken as evidence IDS is not for teaching. The
simulated data reveal potential pitfalls for experimentalists exploring the
role of IDS in language learning. Focusing on different formants and phoneme
sets leads to different conclusions, and the benefit of the teaching data to
learners is not apparent until a sufficient number of examples have been
provided. Finally, we investigate transfer of IDS to learning ADS. The teaching
data improves classification of ADS data, but only for the learner they were
generated to teach; not universally across all classes of learner. This
research offers a theoretically-grounded framework that empowers
experimentalists to systematically evaluate whether IDS is for teaching.

independent particles, each of which is characterized by the complete set of
the Dirac plane waves. This completely symmetric representation of the
particles makes it necessary to choose another solution of the Dirac equation
for the free particle propagator as compared to that currently used in QED. The
Bethe-Salpeter equation is studied in the ladder approximation with using these
free propagators. A new branch of electron-positron bound states which
represent the massless composite bosons, have been found for the actual
coupling equal to the fine structure constant. We have obtained that: 1) the
massless boson states have the normalized complex wave functions; 2) the
average distance between the electron and positron diverges as the boson
kinetic energy goes to zero; 3) the spatial contraction of the wave function of
the transverse motion of strongly coupled electron-positron pair is
continuously occurred with increasing the boson kinetic energy. Unlike the
usual annihilation process in which nothing remains from the electron and
positron, a similar annihilation-like process in which the reaction products
are two or three gamma quanta and the massless boson, is predicted. In this
symmetric representation one could expect states, which have a certain symmetry
relative to Ps states, but have negative masses. For these states the
equal-time bound-state equation was derived neglecting the interaction
retardation and interaction through the vector potential. It turned out that
the wave functions of the negative mass boson states are not normalized. Beyond
these assumptions, the existence of these negative mass states remains unclear.

should predict some size effect for such a deformation pattern. Therefore, this
result clearly demonstrates another inconsistency of indeterminate symmetric
modified couple stress theory (M-CST), which is based on considering the
symmetric torsion tensor as the curvature tensor. On the other hand, the fully
determinate skew-symmetric consistent couple stress theory (C-CST) predicts
results for pure plate bending that tend to agree with mechanics intuition and
experimental evidence. Particularly, C-CST predicts couple-stresses and size
effects for the pure bending of the plate into a spherical shell, which

effect. The main objective of this thesis is to analyze the effects of
contextual variation on specialized environmental concepts with a view to their
representation in terminological definitions. Specifically, we focused on
contextual variation based on thematic restrictions. To accomplish the
objectives of this doctoral thesis, we conducted an empirical study consisting
of the analysis of a set of contextually variable concepts and the creation of
a flexible definition for two of them. As a result of the first part of our
empirical study, we divided our notion of domain-dependent contextual variation
into three different phenomena: modulation, perspectivization and
subconceptualization. These phenomena are additive in that all concepts
experience modulation, some concepts also undergo perspectivization, and
finally, a small number of concepts are additionally subjected to
subconceptualization. In the second part, we applied these notions to
terminological definitions and we presented we presented guidelines on how to
build flexible definitions, from the extraction of knowledge to the actual
writing of the definition.

  open and closed pores",,,"10.3938/jkps.69.386",,"physics.ins-det","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  A new approach for fabricating open and closed porous structures based on
laser processing is presented. Liquid polyimide (PI) was mixed with
azodicarbonamide (ADC, ADA) which is a chemical blowing agent (CBA) and mixture
was pre-cured in order to fabricate solid PI film. Porous PI was prepared by
irradiating PI film mixed with azodicarbonamide. The PI film with
azodicarbonamide was etched by laser ablation, and the CBA was decomposed by
heat induced by the absorbed laser energy. The higher the laser beam
irradiation, the more pores were fabricated due to the resulting increase in
CBA decomposition from 27 mJ/cm2 to 40 mJ/cm2 per single pulse. Higher fluence
at about 50 mJ/cm2 resulted in fewer and larger open pores, which were formed
by the coalescence of small pores. In contrast, a closed porous structure was
fabricated at a fluence of less than 1 mJ/cm2 because PI was barely etched. The
proposed method can be sued to create open and closed micro porous structures
selectively, and is not limited to thermosetting polymers, but is also
effective with thermoplastic polymers.
