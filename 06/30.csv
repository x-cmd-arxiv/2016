$M_{\nu}(1,1)=M_{\nu}(1,3)=M_{\nu}(3,1)=0$, we can have neutrino masses as
function of mixing angle $\theta_{13}$ with normal hierarchy:
$m_{1}<m_{2}<m_{3}$. By taking the central value of mixing angle
$\theta_{13}=9^{o}$ that gives $\epsilon=0.16$ and using the squared mass
difference: $\Delta m_{32}^{2}$ for normal hierarchy, we then obtained neutrino
masses: $m_{1}=0.00847$ eV, $m_{2}=0.01215$ eV, and $m_{3}=0.05062$ eV which

a rich diversity of compositions as inferred through their mean densities. Here
we present a model that combines equilibrium chemistry in evolving disks with
core accretion that tracks materials accreted onto planets during their
formation. In doing so, we aim to explain why super Earths form so frequently
and how they acquire such a diverse range of compositions. A key feature of our
model is disk inhomogeneities, or planet traps, that act as barriers to rapid
type-I migration. The traps we include are the dead zone, which can be caused
by either cosmic ray or X-ray ionization, the ice line, and the heat
transition. We find that in disks with sufficiently long lifetimes ($\gtrsim$ 4
Myr), all traps produce Jovian planets. In these disks, planet formation in the
heat transition and X-ray dead zone produces hot Jupiters while the ice line
and cosmic ray dead zones produce Jupiters at roughly 1 AU. Super Earth
formation takes place within short-lived disks ($\lesssim$ 2 Myr), whereby the
disks are photoevaporated while planets are in a slow phase of gas accretion.
We find that super Earth compositions range from dry and rocky ($<$ 6 % ice by
mass) to those with substantial water contents ($>$ 30 % ice by mass). The
traps play a crucial role in our results, as they dictate where in the disk
particular planets can accrete from, and what compositions they are able to
acquire.

boundary element methods. They lead to a discretization matrix that is
typically dense and large: its size and condition number grow with increasing
frequency. Yet, high frequency scattering problems are intrinsically local in
nature, which is well represented by highly localized rays bouncing around.
Asymptotic methods can be used to reduce the size of the linear system, even
making it frequency independent, by explicitly extracting the oscillatory
properties from the solution using ray tracing or analogous techniques.
However, ray tracing becomes expensive or even intractable in the presence of
(multiple) scattering obstacles with complicated geometries. In this paper, we
start from the same discretization that constructs the fully resolved large and
dense matrix, and achieve asymptotic compression by explicitly localizing the
Green's function instead. This results in a large but sparse matrix, with a
faster associated matrix-vector product and, as numerical experiments indicate,
a much improved condition number. Though an appropriate localisation of the
Green's function also depends on asymptotic information unavailable for general
geometries, we can construct it adaptively in a frequency sweep from small to
large frequencies in a way which automatically takes into account a general
incident wave. We show that the approach is robust with respect to non-convex,
multiple and even near-trapping domains, though the compression rate is clearly
lower in the latter case. Furthermore, in spite of its asymptotic nature, the
method is robust with respect to low-order discretizations such as piecewise
constants, linears or cubics, commonly used in applications. On the other hand,
we do not decrease the total number of degrees of freedom compared to a

signal phase coherence between pulsars, while keeping the statistical
properties of the pulsar timing residuals intact. We then explore a method to
null correlations between pulsars by using a ""scrambled"" overlap-reduction

compare these calculations with a model frequency-dependent dielectric
function. We find that for semiconductors with moderate band gaps, the model

each other. However, for insulators with strong exciton effects, the model
dielectric functions have a better agreement with accurate $GW$ values than the
DFT calculations, particularly in high-frequency region. To understand this, we
repeat the DFT calculations with scissors correction, by shifting DFT Kohn-Sham
energy gap to match the experimental band gap. We find that scissors correction
only moderately improves the DFT dielectric function in low-frequency region.

subtle differences in the way these diseases progress over time. In this paper,

similar disease trajectories and whether there are a small number of degrees of
freedom that account for differences in trajectories across the population.
Second, we want to understand how important clinical outcomes are associated
with disease trajectories. To answer these questions, we propose the Disease
Trajectory Map (DTM), a novel probabilistic model that learns low-dimensional
representations of sparse and irregularly sampled time series. We propose a
stochastic variational inference algorithm for learning the DTM that allows the
model to scale to large modern medical datasets. To demonstrate the DTM, we

simulate network control to quantify modal and boundary controllability, which
together describe complementary features of a region's theoretically predicted

individual differences in these control features derived from structural
connectivity are significantly correlated with individual differences in
cognitive control performance, as measured by a continuous performance

anisotropic cosmological spacetime. Each obtained effective model is
represented by a rainbow metric in which particles of distinct momenta
propagate on different classical geometries. Our analysis shows that upon
certain assumptions and conditions on the parameters determining such
anisotropic models, we surprisingly obtain a unique deformation parameter
$\beta$ in the modified dispersion relation of the modes. Hence inducing an
isotropic deformation despite the general starting considerations. We then
ensure the recovery of the dispersion relation realized in the isotropic case,
studied in [arXiv:1412.6000], when some proper symmetry constraints are
imposed, and we estimate the value of the deformation parameter for this case
in loop quantum cosmology context.

two steps at test time. Firstly it predicts the class labels by applying the

pixel-wise scores from the obtained predictions by applying backprop gradients

smooth coronal loops and the concentrations of magnetic shear, known as
filament channels, that reside above photospheric polarity inversion lines
(PILs). The shear observed in filament channels represents magnetic helicity,
while the smoothness of the coronal loops indicates an apparent lack of
magnetic helicity in the rest of the corona. At the same time, models that
attempt to explain the high temperatures observed in these coronal loops
require magnetic energy, in the form of twist, to be injected at the
photosphere. In addition to magnetic energy, this twist also represents
magnetic helicity. Unlike magnetic energy, magnetic helicity is conserved under
reconnection, and is consequently expected to accumulate and be observed in the
corona. However, filament channels, rather than the coronal loops, are the
locations in the corona where magnetic helicity is observed, and it manifests
itself in the form of shear, rather than twist. This naturally raises the
question: if magnetic helicity needs to be injected to heat coronal loops, why
is it only observed in filament channels, while coronal loops are observed to
be laminar and smooth? This thesis addresses this question using a series of
numerical simulations that demonstrate that magnetic helicity is transported
throughout the solar corona by magnetic reconnection in such a way that it
accumulates above PILs, forming filament channels, and leaving the rest of the
corona generally smooth. In the process, it converts magnetic energy into heat,
accounting for the large observed temperatures. This thesis presents a model
for the formation of filament channels in the solar corona and the presence of
smooth, hot coronal loops, and shows how the transport of magnetic helicity
throughout the solar corona by magnetic reconnection is responsible for both of
these phenomena.

linear approximation of the system dynamics around the mean trajectory and
conservative policy update. One way of constraining the policy change is by
bounding the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence between successive policies.
These approaches already demonstrated great experimental success in challenging
problems such as end-to-end control of physical systems. However, the linear
approximation of the system dynamics can introduce a bias in the policy update
and prevent convergence to the optimal policy. In this article, we propose a
new model-free trajectory-based policy optimization algorithm with guaranteed
monotonic improvement. The algorithm backpropagates a local, quadratic and
time-dependent \qfunc~learned from trajectory data instead of a model of the
system dynamics. Our policy update ensures exact KL-constraint satisfaction
without simplifying assumptions on the system dynamics. We experimentally
demonstrate on highly non-linear control tasks the improvement in performance
of our algorithm in comparison to approaches linearizing the system dynamics.
In order to show the monotonic improvement of our algorithm, we additionally
conduct a theoretical analysis of our policy update scheme to derive a lower
bound of the change in policy return between successive iterations.

power-law inflation that predict large values for the scalar spectral index

baryon acoustic oscillations data and the B-mode data from BICEP2/Keck makes
power-law inflation disfavoured, while adding local measurements of the Hubble

bright points associated with intrusions of minority magnetic polarity. The
embedded-bipole model for these jets posits that they are driven by explosive,
fast reconnection between the stressed closed field of the embedded bipole and
the open field of the surrounding coronal hole. Previous numerical studies in
Cartesian geometry, assuming uniform ambient magnetic field and plasma while
neglecting gravity and solar wind, demonstrated that the model is robust and
can produce jet-like events in simple configurations. We have extended these
investigations by including spherical geometry, gravity, and solar wind in a
nonuniform, coronal hole-like ambient atmosphere. Our simulations confirm that
the jet is initiated by the onset of a kink-like instability of the internal
closed field, which induces a burst of reconnection between the closed and
external open field, launching a helical jet. Our new results demonstrate that
the jet propagation is sustained through the outer corona, in the form of a
traveling nonlinear Alfven wave front trailed by slower-moving plasma density
enhancements that are compressed and accelerated by the wave. This finding
agrees well with observations of white-light coronal-hole jets, and can explain
microstreams and torsional Alfven waves detected in situ in the solar wind. We
also use our numerical results to deduce scaling relationships between
properties of the coronal source region and the characteristics of the
resulting jet, which can be tested against observations.

previous studies of the influence of shear and rotation on $\delta_\mathrm{c}$
have been performed with heuristically motivated models, we try to avoid this
model dependence and sample the external tidal shear values directly from the
statistics of the underlying linearly evolved density field based on first
order Lagrangian perturbation theory. Within this self-consistent approach, in
the sense that we restrict our treatment to scales where linear theory is still
applicable, only fluctuations larger than the scale of the considered objects
are included into the sampling process which naturally introduces a mass
dependence of $\delta_\mathrm{c}$. We find that shear effects are predominant
for smaller objects and at lower redshifts, i. e. the effect on
$\delta_\mathrm{c}$ is at or below the percent level for the $\Lambda$CDM
model. For dark energy models we also find small but noticeable differences,
similar to $\Lambda$CDM. The virial overdensity $\Delta_\mathrm{V}$ is nearly
unaffected by the external shear. The now mass dependent $\delta_c$ is used to
evaluate the mass function for different dark energy scenarios and afterwards
to predict cluster number counts, which indicate that ignoring the shear
contribution can lead to biases of the order of $1\sigma$ in the estimation of
cosmological parameters like $\Omega_\mathrm{m}$, $\sigma_8$ or $w$.

Let $r\equiv n\pmod{t}$ with $0\leq r<t$, and let ${\theta}_i=(q^i-1)/(q-1)$.
We essentially prove that if $2\leq r<t\leq {\theta}_r$, then the maximum size

$({\theta}_n-{\theta}_{t+r})/{\theta}_t+q^r-(q-1)(t-3)+1$. We actually give
tighter bounds when certain divisibility conditions are satisfied. These bounds
improve on the previously known upper bound for the maximum size partial

qualitatively different behaviors. Namely, thermal noise can stabilize a regime
where one junction is phase-locked to the drive voltage while the other is
blocked in one state. On the contrary, electrical noise causes the junctions to
have highly correlated behaviors and thus cannot induce the latter. These
results open the way for the design of superparamagnetic tunnel junctions that
can perform computation through synchronization, and which harvest the largest

format which aims for numerical modeling of the 3D long-range interaction
potentials in multi-particle systems. The main idea of the RS tensor format is
the independent grid-based low-rank representation of the localized and global
parts in the target tensor which allows the efficient numerical approximation
of $N$-particle interaction potentials. The single-particle reference potential
like $1/\|x\|$ is split into a sum of localized and long-range low-rank
canonical tensors represented on a fine 3D $n\times n\times n$ Cartesian grid.
The smoothed long-range contribution to the total potential sum is represented
on the 3D grid in $O(n)$ storage via the low-rank canonical/Tucker tensor. We
prove that the Tucker rank parameters depend only logarithmically on the number
of particles $N$ and the grid-size $n$. Agglomeration of the short range part
in the sum is reduced to an independent treatment of $N$ localized terms with
almost disjoint effective supports, calculated in $O(N)$ operations. Thus, the
cumulated sum of short range clusters is parametrized by a single low-rank
canonical reference tensor with a local support, accomplished by a list of
particle coordinates and their charges. The RS canonical/Tucker tensor
representations reduce the cost of multi-linear algebraic operations on the 3D
potential sums arising in modeling of multi-dimensional data by radial basis
functions, say, in computation of the electrostatic potential of a protein, in
3D integration and convolution transforms, computation of gradients, forces and
the interaction energy of a many-particle systems, and in low parametric
fitting of multi-dimensional scattered data by reducing all of them to 1D

all examples of complex relational systems, whose emerging behaviours are
largely determined by the non-trivial networks of interactions among their
constituents, namely individuals, computers, or neurons, rather than the
properties of the units themselves. In the last two decades, network scientists
have proposed models of increasing complexity to better understand real-world
systems. Only recently we have realised that multiplexity, i.e. the coexistence
of several types of interactions among the constituents of a complex system, is
responsible for substantial qualitative and quantitative differences in the
type and variety of behaviours that a complex system can exhibit. As a
consequence, multilayer and multiplex networks have become a hot topic in
complexity science. Here we provide an overview of some of the measures
proposed so far to characterise the structure of multiplex networks, and a
selection of models aiming at reproducing those structural properties and
quantifying their statistical significance. Focusing on a subset of relevant
topics, this brief review is a quite comprehensive introduction to the most
basic tools for the analysis of multiplex networks observed in the real-world.
The wide applicability of multiplex networks as a framework to model complex

galactic-scale habitable zones which offer a stable environment for life to
form and evolve in complexity. Recently, this idea has been extended to
cosmological scales by studies modelling the habitability of the local Universe
in its entirety (e.g. Dayal et al. 2015; Li & Zhang 2015). However, all of
these studies have solely focused on estimating the potentially detrimental
effects of either Type II supernovae (SNII) or Gamma Ray Bursts (GRBs),
ignoring the contributions from Type Ia supernovae (SNIa) and active galactic
nuclei (AGN). In this study we follow two different approaches, based on (i)
the amplitude of deleterious radiation and (ii) the total planet-hosting volume
irradiated by deleterious radiation. We simultaneously track the contributions
from the key astrophysical sources (SNII, SNIa, AGN and GRBs) for the entire
Universe, for both scenarios, to determine its habitability through 13.8
billion years of cosmic time. We find that SNII dominate the total radiation
budget and the volume irradiated by deleterious radiation at any cosmic epoch
closely followed by SNIa (that contribute half as much as SNII), with GRBs and
AGN making up a negligible portion (<1%). Secondly, as a result of the total
mass in stars (or the total number of planets) slowly building-up with time and
the total deleterious radiation density, and volume affected, falling-off after
the first 3 billion years, we find that the Universe has steadily increased in
habitability through cosmic time. We find that, depending on the exact model
assumptions, the Universe is 2.5 to 20 times more habitable today compared to
when life first appeared on the Earth 4 billion years ago. We find that this
increase in habitability will persist until the final stars die out over the

physical media including water waves, nonlinear optics, and Bose-Einstein
condensates. As in the classical theory of hyperbolic equations where a
non-convex flux leads to non-classical solution structures, a non-convex linear
dispersion relation provides an intriguing dispersive hydrodynamic analogue.
Here, the fifth order Korteweg-de Vries (KdV) equation, also known as the
Kawahara equation, a classical model for shallow water waves, is shown to be a
universal model of Eulerian hydrodynamics with higher order dispersive effects.
Utilizing asymptotic methods and numerical computations, this work classifies
the long-time behavior of solutions for step-like initial data. For convex
dispersion, the result is a dispersive shock wave (DSW), qualitatively and
quantitatively bearing close resemblance to the KdV DSW. For non-convex
dispersion, three distinct dynamic regimes are observed. For small jumps, a
perturbed KdV DSW with positive polarity and orientation is generated,
accompanied by small amplitude radiation from an embedded solitary wave leading
edge, termed a radiating DSW or RDSW. For moderate jumps, a crossover regime is
observed with waves propagating forward and backward from the sharp transition
region. For jumps exceeding a critical threshold, a new type of DSW is observed
we term a translating DSW or TDSW. The TDSW consists of a traveling wave that
connects a partial, non-monotonic, negative solitary wave at the trailing edge
to an interior nonlinear periodic wave. Its speed, a generalized
Rankine-Hugoniot jump condition, is determined by the far-field structure of
the traveling wave. The TDSW is resolved at the leading edge by a harmonic
wavepacket moving with the linear group velocity. The non-classical TDSW
exhibits features common to both dissipative and dispersive shock waves.

use of an evolutionary optimization algorithm to fit pulse profiles to
determine the best-fit masses and radii. By fitting synthetic data, we assess
how well the optimization algorithm can recover the input parameters. Multiple
Poisson realizations of the synthetic pulse profiles, constructed with 1.6
million counts and no background, were fitted with the Ferret algorithm to
analyze both statistical and degeneracy-related uncertainty, and to explore how

star with a spin frequency of 600\,Hz, the best-fit mass and radius are
accurate to $\le5$%, with respective uncertainties of $\le7$% and $\le10$%. The
accuracy and precision depend on the observer inclination and spot co-latitude,

the noisy responses are modeled as the output of a binary symmetric channel the
20 questions problem can be mapped to an equivalent problem of channel coding
with unequal error protection (UEP). A new non-adaptive querying strategy based
on UEP superposition coding is introduced whose estimation error decreases with
an exponential rate of convergence that is significantly better than that of
the UEP repetition coding introduced by Variani et al. (2015). With the
proposed querying strategy, the rate of exponential decrease in the number of
queries matches the rate of a closed-loop adaptive scheme where queries are
sequentially designed with the benefit of feedback. Furthermore, the achievable
error exponent is significantly better than that of random block codes
employing equal error protection.

exoplanet Kepler-421b in order to constrain the existence and extent of transit
timing variations (TTVs). Previously, the Kepler Spacecraft only observed two
transits of Kepler-421b leaving the planet's transit ephemeris unconstrained.
Our visible light, time-series observations from the 4.3-meter Discovery
Channel Telescope were designed to capture pre-transit baseline and the partial
transit of Kepler-421b barring significant TTVs. We use the light curves to
assess the probabilities of various transit models using both the posterior
odds ratio and the Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) and find that a transit
model with no TTVs is favored to 3.6-sigma confidence. These observations
suggest that Kepler-421b is either alone in its system or is only experiencing
minor dynamic interactions with an unseen companion. With the Kepler-421b
ephemeris constrained, we calculate future transit times and discuss the
opportunity to characterize the atmosphere of this cold, long-period exoplanet
via transmission spectroscopy. Our investigation emphasizes the difficulties
associated with observing long-period exoplanet transits and the consequences
that arise from failing to refine transit ephemerides.

believed to be accelerated to large velocities by a process of tidal disruption
of binary stars passing close to a supermassive black hole (SMBH) which resides
in the center of the Galaxy. It is, however, still unclear, where these
relatively young stars were born and which dynamical process pushed them to
nearly radial orbits around the SMBH. In this paper we investigate the
possibility that the young binaries originated from a thin eccentric disc,
similar to the one observed in the Galactic center nowadays. By means of direct
N-body simulations, we follow the dynamical evolution of an initially thin and
eccentric disc of stars with a 100% binary fraction orbiting around the SMBH.
Such a configuration leads to Kozai-Lidov oscillations of orbital elements,
bringing considerable amount of binaries to close vicinity of the black hole.
Subsequent tidal disruption of these binaries accelerates one of their
component to velocities well above the escape velocity from the SMBH while the
second component becomes tightly bound to the SMBH. We describe the main
kinematic properties of the escaping and tightly bound stars within our model
and compare them qualitatively to the properties of the observed HVSs and
S-stars, respectively. The most prominent feature is a strong anisotropy in the
directions of the escaping stars which is observed for the Galactic HVSs but
not explained yet.

surrounding the Galactic Center, might originate from a population of
millisecond pulsars that formed in globular clusters. With this in mind, we
employ the publicly available Fermi data to study the gamma-ray emission from
157 globular clusters, identifying a statistically significant signal from 25
of these sources (ten of which are not found in existing gamma-ray catalogs).
We combine these observations with the predicted pulsar formation rate based on
the stellar encounter rate of each globular cluster to constrain the gamma-ray
luminosity function of millisecond pulsars in the Milky Way's globular cluster
system. We find that this pulsar population exhibits a luminosity function that
is quite similar to those millisecond pulsars observed in the field of the
Milky Way (i.e. the thick disk). After pulsars are expelled from a globular
cluster, however, they continue to lose rotational kinetic energy and become
less luminous, causing their luminosity function to depart from the
steady-state distribution. Using this luminosity function and a model for the
globular cluster disruption rate, we show that millisecond pulsars born in
globular clusters can account for only a few percent or less of the observed
GeV excess. Among other challenges, scenarios in which the entire GeV excess is
generated from such pulsars are in conflict with the observed mass of the Milky
Way's Central Stellar Cluster.

nearly all metals produced in high-redshift galaxies are carried out in winds
that reach $0.25 R_{\rm vir}$. When measured at $0.25 R_{\rm vir}$ the
metallicity of outflows is slightly higher than the interstellar medium (ISM)
metallicity. Many metals thus reside in the CGM. Cooling and recycling from
this reservoir determine the metal budget in the ISM. The outflowing metal flux
decreases by a factor of $\sim2-5$ between $0.25 R_{\rm vir}$ and $R_{\rm
vir}$. Furthermore, outflow metallicity is typically lower at $R_{\rm vir}$
owing to dilution of the remaining outflow by metal-poor material swept up from
the CGM. The inflow metallicity at $R_{\rm vir}$ is generally low, but outflow
and inflow metallicities are similar in the inner halo. At low redshift,
massive galaxies no longer generate outflows that reach the CGM, causing a
divergence in CGM and ISM metallicity. Dwarf galaxies continue to generate
outflows, although they preferentially retain metal ejecta. In all but the
least massive galaxy considered, a majority of the metals are within the halo
at $z=0$. We measure the fraction of metals in CGM, ISM and stars, and quantify
the thermal state of CGM metals in each halo. The total amount of metals in the
low-redshift CGM of two simulated $L*$ galaxies is consistent with estimates
from the COS halos survey, while for the other two it appears to be lower.

photometric bands at 100, 160, 250, 350 and 500$\mu$m covering a total area of
600deg$^2$. In this paper we describe the identification of optical

over three equatorial fields of roughly 12$^\circ$x4.5$^\circ$ centred at
9$^h$, 12$^h$ and 14.5$^h$ respectively. Of all the H-ATLAS fields, the
equatorial regions benefit from the greatest overlap with current
multi-wavelength surveys spanning ultraviolet (UV) to mid-infrared regimes, as
well as extensive spectroscopic coverage. We use a likelihood-ratio technique
to identify SDSS counterparts at r<22.4 for 250-$\mu$m-selected sources
detected at $\geq$ 4$\sigma$ ($\approx$28mJy). We find `reliable' counterparts
(reliability R$\geq$0.8) for 44,835 sources (39 per cent), with an estimated
completeness of 73.0 per cent and contamination rate of 4.7 per cent. Using
redshifts and multi-wavelength photometry from GAMA and other public

of optical colours, total infrared (IR) luminosities, and IR/UV ratios, with no
strong disposition towards mid-IR-classified AGN in comparison with optical
selection. The data described herein, together with all maps and catalogues

of this novel phase, we use renormalization group methods to extract universal
transport characteristics of superconductor/quantum spin Hall heterostructures

conductance through a grounded superconductor and show that the results depend
sensitively on the interaction strength in the leads, the size of the
superconducting region, and the presence or absence of time-reversal-breaking

isolated by magnetic barriers. Here we predict e-periodic Coulomb-blockade
peaks, as recently observed in nanowire devices [Albrecht et al., Nature 531,

charge tunable via the relative orientation of the barrier magnetizations. As
an interesting corollary, when the magnetic barriers arise from strong
interactions at the edge that spontaneously break time-reversal symmetry, the
Coulomb-blockade periodicity changes from e to e/2. These findings suggest
several future experiments that probe unique characteristics of topological
superconductivity at the quantum spin Hall edge.

only objects that are not observed along the AGB of NGC 6752 are stars with
extreme Na enhancement. This is also consistent with standard stellar evolution

Compton-thick (CT) active galactic nuclei (AGN) is difficult to measure. A
statistically significant correlation between the Eddington ratio,
{\lambda}$_{Edd}$, and the X-ray power-law index, {\Gamma}, observed in
unobscured AGN offers an estimate of their growth rate from X-ray spectroscopy
(albeit with large scatter). However, since X-rays undergo reprocessing by
Compton scattering and photoelectric absorption when the line-of-sight to the
central engine is heavily obscured, the recovery of the intrinsic {\Gamma} is
challenging. Here we study a sample of local, predominantly Compton-thick
megamaser AGN, where the black hole mass, and thus Eddington luminosity, are
well known. We compile results on X-ray spectral fitting of these sources with
sensitive high-energy (E> 10 keV) NuSTAR data, where X-ray torus models which
take into account the reprocessing effects have been used to recover the
intrinsic {\Gamma} values and X-ray luminosities, L$_X$. With a simple
bolometric correction to L$_X$ to calculate {\lambda}$_{Edd}$, we find a
statistically significant correlation between {\Gamma} and {\lambda}$_{Edd}$ (p
= 0.007). A linear fit to the data yields {\Gamma} =
(0.41$\pm$0.18)log$_{10}${\lambda}$_{Edd}$+(2.38$\pm$ 0.20), which is
statistically consistent with results for unobscured AGN. This result implies
that torus modeling successfully recovers the intrinsic AGN parameters. Since
the megamasers have low-mass black holes (M$_{BH}\approx10^6-10^7$ M$_{sol}$)
and are highly inclined, our results extend the {\Gamma}-{\lambda}$_{Edd}$
relationship to lower masses and argue against strong orientation effects in
the corona, in support of AGN unification. Finally this result supports the use
of {\Gamma} as a growth-rate indicator for accreting black holes, even for
Compton-thick AGN.

such it provides a desingularization. The holonomy groupoid is ""minimal"" among

atomic line defect (i.e. a step), which is defined via appropriate statistical
average over KRSOS microstates. Near thermodynamic equilibrium and for low
enough supersaturation, we show that this mesoscale picture is reasonably
faithful to the Burton-Cabrera-Frank (BCF) step-flow model. More specifically,
we invoke a maximum principle in conjunction with asymptotic error estimates to
derive the elements of the BCF model: (i) a diffusion equation for the density
of adsorbed adatoms; (ii) a step velocity law; and (iii) a linear relation for
the mass flux of adatoms at the step. In this vein, we also provide a criterion
by which the adatom flux remains linear in supersaturation, suggesting a range
of non-equilibrium conditions under which the BCF model remains valid. Lastly,
we make use of kinetic Monte Carlo simulations to numerically study effects
that drive the system to higher supersaturations -- e.g. deposition of material
onto the surface from above. Using these results, we describe empirical
corrections to the BCF model that amount to a nonlinear relation for the adatom
flux at the step edge.

results from the interplay of locally differing input and the organization of
spectral and temporal neural preferences that change gradually across the
nucleus. This raises the question how similar the neural representation of the
communication sounds is across these gradients of neural preferences, and
whether it also changes gradually. Multi-unit cluster spike trains were
recorded from guinea pigs presented with a spectrotemporally rich set of eleven
species-specific communication sounds. Using cross-correlation, we analyzed the
response similarity of spiking activity across a broad frequency range for
similarly and differently frequency-tuned neurons. Furthermore, we separated
the contribution of the stimulus to the correlations to investigate whether
similarity is only attributable to the stimulus, or, whether interactions exist
between the multi-unit clusters that lead to correlations and whether these
follow the same representation as the response similarity. We found that
similarity of responses is dependent on the neurons' spatial distance for
similarly and differently frequency-tuned neurons, and that similarity
decreases gradually with spatial distance. Significant neural correlations
exist, and contribute to the response similarity. Our findings suggest that for
multi-unit clusters in the mammalian inferior colliculus, the gradual response
similarity with spatial distance to natural complex sounds is shaped by neural
interactions and the gradual organization of neural preferences.

minimizing geodesics on a manifold M. In particular, we assume that the
manifold M is acted upon by a group G which is a symmetry group for the
dynamics. The action of G on M is proper but not necessarily free. As a
consequence, the orbit space M/G is not necessarily a manifold but it presents
the more general structure of a stratified space. The main ingredients of the
method are a reduction of the problem to the orbit space M/G and an analysis of
the reachable sets on this space. We give general results relating the
stratified structure of the orbit space, and its decomposition into orbit
types, with the optimal synthesis. We consider in more detail the case of the
so-called K-P problem where the manifold M is itself a Lie group and the group
G is determined by a Cartan decomposition of M. In this case, the geodesics can
be explicitly calculated and are analytic. As an illustration, we apply our

  Images",,,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Segmentation remains an important problem in image processing. For
homogeneous (piecewise smooth) images, a number of important models have been
developed and refined over the past several decades. However, these models
often fail when applied to the substantially larger class of natural images
that simultaneously contain regions of both texture and homogeneity. This work
introduces a bi-level constrained minimization model for simultaneous
multiphase segmentation of images containing both homogeneous and textural
regions. We develop novel norms defined in different functional Banach spaces
for the segmentation which results in a non-convex minimization. Finally, we
develop a generalized notion of segmentation delving into approximation theory
and demonstrating that a more refined decomposition of these images results in
multiple meaningful components. Both theoretical results and demonstrations on
natural images are provided.

to characterize the stochastic dynamics of cell division control in bacteria.
Different modeling frameworks were used to infer specific mechanisms from such
data, but the links between frameworks are poorly explored, with relevant
consequences for how well any particular mechanism can be supported by the
data. Here, we describe a simple and generic framework in which two common
formalisms can be used interchangeably: (i) a continuous-time division process
described by a hazard function and (ii) a discrete-time equation describing
cell size across generations (where the unit of time is a cell cycle). In our
framework, this second process is a discrete-time Langevin equation with a
simple physical analogue. By perturbative expansion around the mean initial
size (or inter-division time), we show explicitly how this framework describes
a wide range of division control mechanisms, including combinations of time and
size control, as well as the constant added size mechanism recently found to
capture several aspects of the cell division behavior of different bacteria. As
we show by analytical estimates and numerical simulation, the available data
are characterized with great precision by the first-order approximation of this
expansion. Hence, a single dimensionless parameter defines the strength and the
action of the division control. However, this parameter may emerge from several
mechanisms, which are distinguished only by higher-order terms in our
perturbative expansion. An analytical estimate of the sample size needed to
distinguish between second-order effects shows that this is larger than what is
available in the current datasets. These results provide a unified framework
for future studies and clarify the relevant parameters at play in the control
of cell division.

properties of carbon dust grains in Circumstellar envelopes (CSEs) of

this goal, we apply our recent dust growth description, coupled with a
radiative transfer code to the CSEs of C-stars evolving along the TP-AGB, for
which we compute spectra and colors. Then we compare our modeled colors in the
near- and mid-infrared (NIR and MIR) bands with the observed ones, testing
different assumptions in our dust scheme and employing several data sets of
optical constants for carbon dust available in the literature. Different
assumptions adopted in our dust scheme change the typical size of the carbon
grains produced. We constrain carbon dust properties by selecting the
combination of grain size and optical constants which best reproduces several
colors in the NIR and MIR at the same time. The different choices of optical
properties and grain size lead to differences in the NIR and MIR colors greater
than two magnitudes in some cases. We conclude that the complete set of
observed NIR and MIR colors are best reproduced by small grains, with sizes
between $\sim$0.035 and $\sim$0.12~$\mu$m, rather than by large grains between
$\sim0.2$ and $0.7$~$\mu$m. The inability of large grains to reproduce NIR and
MIR colors seems independent of the adopted optical data set. We also find a
possible trend of the grain size with mass-loss and/or carbon excess in the
CSEs of these stars.

  Solutions: A Comprehensive Review","58 pages, 167 equations, 116 references",,,,"cond-mat.soft","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  This article presents a comprehensive review of the Hydrodynamic Scaling
Model for the dynamics of polymers in dilute and nondilute solutions. The
Hydrodynamic Scaling Model differs from some other treatments of non-dilute
polymer solutions in that it takes polymer dynamics up to high concentrations
to be dominated by solvent-mediated hydrodynamic interactions, with chain
crossing constraints presumed to create at most secondary corrections. Many
other models take the contrary stand, namely that chain crossing constraints
dominate the dynamics of nondilute polymer solutions, while hydrodynamic
interactions only create secondary corrections. This article begins with a
historical review. We then consider single-chain behavior, in particular the
Kirkwood-Riseman model; contradictions between the Kirkwood-Riseman and more
familiar Rouse-Zimm models are emphasized. An extended Kirkwood-Riseman model
that gives interchain hydrodynamic interactions is developed and applied to
generate pseudovirial series for the self-diffusion coefficient and the
low-shear viscosity. To extrapolate to large concentrations, rationales based
on self-similarity and on the Altenberger-Dahler Positive-Function
Renormalization Group are developed and applied to the pseudovirial series for
$D_{s}$ and $\eta$. Based on the renormalization group method, a two-parameter
temporal scaling ansatz is invoked as a path to determining the frequency
dependences of the storage and loss moduli. A short description is given for
each of the individual papers that developed the Hydrodynamic Scaling Model.
Phenomenological evidence supporting aspects of the model is noted. Finally,
directions for future development of the Hydrodynamic Scaling Model are
presented.

the Killing superalgebra, which takes a rather simple form and whose closure is
the key step in proving the main result. In addition, we find that the

its right end. Such ordered granular media represent an interesting new class
of nonlinear acoustic metamaterials, since they exhibit essentially nonlinear
acoustics and have been designated as 'sonic vacua' due to the fact that their
corresponding speed of sound (as defined in classical acoustics) is zero.This
paves the way for essentially nonlinear and energy-dependent acoustics with no
counterparts in linear theory. We experimentally detect time-periodic, strongly
nonlinear resonances whereby the particles (beads) of the granular chain
respond at integer multiples of the excitation period, and which correspond to
local peaks of the maximum transmitted force at the chain's right, fixed end.In
between these resonances we detect a local minimum of the maximum transmitted
forces corresponding to an anti-resonance in the stationary-state dynamics. The
experimental results of this work confirm previous theoretical predictions, and
verify the existence of strongly nonlinear resonance responses in a system with
a complete absence of any linear spectrum; as such, the experimentally detected
nonlinear resonance spectrum is passively tunable with energy and sensitive to
dissipative effects such as internal structural damping in the beads, and
friction or plasticity effects. The experimental results are verified by direct
numerical simulations and by numerical stability analysis.

neighborhood-based search to estimate a collection of candidate teams. This
procedure dramatically reduces the computational complexity of an exhaustive
search. Our procedure consists of two steps: communication counts between
actors are first smoothed using a multivariate EWMA strategy. Densely connected
teams are identified as candidates using a neighborhood search approach. These
candidate teams are then monitored using a surveillance plan derived from a
generalized EWMA statistic. Monitoring plans are established for collaborative
teams, teams with a dominant leader, as well as for global outbreaks. We
consider weighted heterogeneous dynamic networks, where the expected
communication count between each pair of actors is potentially different across
pairs and time, as well as homogeneous networks, where the expected
communication count is constant across time and actors. Our monitoring plans
are evaluated on a test bed of simulated networks as well as on the U.S. Senate
co-voting network, which models the Senate voting patterns from 1857 to 2015.
Our analysis suggests that our surveillance strategies can efficiently detect

as a sum of non-adjacent Fibonacci numbers. This result has been generalized to
many sequences $\{a_n\}$ arising from an integer positive linear recurrence,
each of which has a corresponding notion of a legal decomposition. Previous
work proved the number of summands in decompositions of $m \in [a_n, a_{n+1})$
becomes normally distributed as $n\to\infty$, and the individual gap measures
associated to each $m$ converge to geometric random variables, when the leading
coefficient in the recurrence is positive. We explore what happens when this
assumption is removed in two special sequences. In one we regain all previous
results, including unique decomposition; in the other the number of legal
decompositions exponentially grows and the natural choice for the legal
decomposition (the greedy algorithm) only works approximately 92.6\% of the
time (though a slight modification always works). We find a connection between
the two sequences, which explains why the distribution of the number of
summands and gaps between summands behave the same in the two examples. In the
course of our investigations we found a new perspective on dealing with roots
of polynomials associated to the characteristic polynomials. This allows us to
remove the need for the detailed technical analysis of their properties which
greatly complicated the proofs of many earlier results in the subject, as well

  The proof uses the algorithm of Gu\`ardia, Montes and Nart to calculate an

establish an upper bound for the class number; further algebraic arguments
prove the class number is 1. It is possible to apply these techniques to other

They are successful indispensable tools in science and engineering, because
they allow for computationally cheap low ensemble state approximation for
extremely large dimensional turbulent dynamical systems. The practical finite
ensemble filter like EnKF necessarily involve modifications such as covariance
inflation and localization, and it is a genuine mystery why they perform so
well with small ensemble sizes in large dimensions. This paper provides the
first rigorous stochastic analysis of the accuracy and covariance fidelity of
EnKF in the practical regime where the ensemble size is much smaller than the
large ambient dimension for EnKFs with random coefficients. A challenging issue
overcome here is that EnKF in huge dimensions introduces unavoidable bias and

We aim to probe the internal structure and investigate more detailed

We analyse the observed frequencies of the $\delta$ Scuti star HD 50844
obtained by Balona (2014), and search for possible multiplets based on the
rotational splitting law of g-mode. We tried to disentangle the frequency
spectra of HD 50844 by means of the rotational splitting only. We then compare
them with theoretical pulsation modes, which correspond to stellar evolutionary
models with various sets of initial metallicity and stellar mass, to find the
best-fitting model. Results. There are three multiplets including two complete
triplets and one incomplete quintuplet, in which mode identifications for
spherical harmonic degree $l$ and azimuthal number $m$ are unique. The
corresponding rotational period of HD 50844 is found to be
2.44$^{+0.13}_{-0.08}$ days. The physical parameters of HD 50844 are well
limited in a small region by three modes identified as nonradial ones
($f_{11}$, $f_{22}$, and $f_{29}$) and by the fundamental radial mode
($f_{4}$). Our results show that the three nonradial modes ($f_{11}$, $f_{22}$,
and $f_{29}$) are all mixed modes, which mainly represent the property of the
helium core. The fundamental radial mode ($f_{4}$) mainly represents the
property of the stellar envelope. In order to fit these four pulsation modes,
both the helium core and the stellar envelope must be matched to the actual
structure of HD 50844. Finally, the mass of the helium core of HD 50844 is
estimated to be 0.173 $\pm$ 0.004 $M_{\odot}$ for the first time. The physical
parameters of HD 50844 are determined to be $M=$ 1.81 $\pm$ 0.01 $M_{\odot}$,

on euclidean Jordan algebras (EJAs), satisfying some reasonable additional
constraints motivated by the desire to construct dagger-compact categories of
such models. We show that no such composite has the exceptional Jordan algebra
as a direct summand, nor does any such composite exist if one factor has an
exceptional summand, unless the other factor is a direct sum of one-dimensional
Jordan algebras (representing essentially a classical system). Moreover, we
show that any composite of simple, non-exceptional EJAs is a direct summand of
their universal tensor product, sharply limiting the possibilities.
  These results warrant our focussing on concrete Jordan algebras of hermitian
matrices, i.e., euclidean Jordan algebras with a preferred embedding in a
complex matrix algebra}. We show that these can be organized in a natural way
as a symmetric monoidal category, albeit one that is not compact closed. We
then construct a related category InvQM of embedded euclidean Jordan algebras,
having fewer objects but more morphisms, that is not only compact closed but
dagger-compact. This category unifies finite-dimensional real, complex and
quaternionic mixed-state quantum mechanics, except that the composite of two
complex quantum systems comes with an extra classical bit.
  Our notion of composite requires neither tomographic locality, nor
preservation of purity under tensor product. The categories we construct
include examples in which both of these conditions fail. In such cases, the
information capacity (the maximum number of mutually distinguishable states) of
a composite is greater than the product of the capacities of its constituents.

interface where a constriction is patterned in the electron liquid. We find
that an additional back-gating can further confine the electron liquid into an
isolated island. Conductance and differential conductance measurements show
resonant tunneling through the island. The data at various temperatures and

the order of 10nm. The magnetic field dependence suggests absence of spin
degeneracy in the island. Our method is suitable for creating superconducting

principal $G-$bundle. This theory uses a multiscale method and is related to
vibrodynamics. For a fast oscillating motion with the symmetry Lie group $G$,
we prove that the averaged equation (i.e. the equation describing the slow
motion) is the Euler equation on the dual of a certain central extension of the
corresponding Lie algebra $\mathfrak g$. As an application of this theory we
study the Craik--Leibovich (CL) equation in hydrodynamics. We show that CL
equation can be regarded as the Euler equation on the dual of an appropriate
central extension of the Lie algebra of divergence-free vector fields. From
this geometric point of view, one can give a generalization of CL equation on
any Riemannian manifold with boundary. For accuracy of the averaged equation,
we prove that the difference between the solution of the averaged equation and
the solution of the perturbed equation remains small (of order $\epsilon$) over
a very long time interval (of order $1/{\epsilon^2}$). Combining the geometric
structure of the generalized CL equation and the averaging theorem, we present
a large class of adiabatic invariants for the perturbation model of the
Langmuir circulation in the ocean.

this paper is devoted to the study of sharp endpoint restriction estimates for

primarily utilized organelle genes that likely differ in evolutionary histories
from nuclear genes. To better understand the evolutionary history of rosids, it
is necessary to investigate their phylogenetic relationships using nuclear
genes. Here, we employed large-scale phylogenomic datasets composed of nuclear
genes, including 891 clusters of putative orthologous genes. Combined with
comprehensive taxon sampling covering 63 species representing 14 out of the 17
orders, we reconstructed the rosids phylogeny with coalescence and
concatenation methods, yielding similar tree topologies from all datasets.
However, these topologies did not agree on the placement of Zygophyllales.
Through comprehensive analyses, we found that missing data and gene tree
heterogeneity were potential factors that may mislead concatenation methods, in
particular, large amounts of missing data under high gene tree heterogeneity.
Our results provided new insights into the deep phylogenetic relationships of
the rosids, and demonstrated that coalescence methods may effectively resolve

different types of side information as well as the visual feature into one

multiple types of side information in it to achieve the ZSL. The close-form

flare regions. Quasi-periodic pulsations (QPPs) in the flare emissions are
commonly observed in a wide range of wavelengths. Recent observations have
found that fast-mode magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) waves are quasi-periodically
emitted from some flaring sites (quasi-periodic propagating fast-mode
magnetoacoustic waves; QPFs). Both of QPPs and QPFs imply a cyclic disturbance
originating from the flaring sites. However, the physical mechanisms remain
puzzling. By performing a set of two-dimensional MHD simulations of a solar
flare, we discovered the local oscillation above the loops filled with
evaporated plasma (above-the-loop-top region) and the generation of QPFs from
such oscillating regions. Unlike all previous models for QPFs, our model
includes essential physics for solar flares, such as magnetic reconnection,
heat conduction, and chromospheric evaporation. We revealed that QPFs can be
spontaneously excited by the above-the-loop-top oscillation. It was found that
this oscillation is controlled by the backflow of the reconnection outflow. The
new model revealed that flare loops and the above-the-loop-top region are full
of shocks and waves, which is different from the previous expectations based on
a standard flare model and previous simulations. In this paper, we will show
the QPF generation process based on our new picture of flare loops and will
briefly discuss a possible relationship between QPFs and QPPs. Our findings
will change the current view of solar flares to a new view in which they are a
very dynamic phenomenon with full of shocks and waves.

In most cases, the directional control occurs via a dissociative ionization

dissociating ion versus selective ionization of oriented neutral molecules,
however, could not be distinguished for even small heteronuclear molecules such
as CO. Here, we introduce a technique, using elliptically polarized pump and
linearly polarized two-color probe pulses that unambiguously distinguishes the
roles of laser-induced state coupling and selective ionization. The measured
photoelectron momentum distributions governed by the light polarizations allow
us to coincidently identify the ionization and dissociation from the pump and
probe pulses. Directional dissociation of CO+ as a function of the relative
phase of the linearly polarized two-color pulse is observed for both parallel

space exhibit a time offset of $\sim 13$ days between the caustic spikes,
indicating that the relative lens-source positions seen from the two places are
displaced by parallax effects. From modeling the light curves, we measure the
space-based microlens parallax. Combined with the angular Einstein radius
measured by analyzing the caustic crossings, we determine the mass and distance
of the lens. We find that the lens is a binary composed of two G-type stars
with masses $\sim 1.0\ M_\odot$ and $\sim 0.9\ M_\odot$ located at a distance
$\sim 3$ kpc. In addition, we are able to constrain the complete orbital
parameters of the lens thanks to the precise measurement of the microlens
parallax derived from the joint analysis. In contrast to the binary event
OGLE-2014-BLG-1050, which was also observed by {\it Spitzer}, we find that the
interpretation of OGLE-2015-BLG-0479 does not suffer from the degeneracy
between $(\pm,\pm)$ and $(\pm,\mp)$ solutions, confirming that the four-fold
parallax degeneracy in single-lens events collapses into the two-fold
degeneracy for the general case of binary-lens events. The location of the
blend in the color-magnitude diagram is consistent with the lens properties,
suggesting that the blend is the lens itself. The blend is bright enough for
spectroscopy and thus this possibility can be checked from future follow-up
observations.

on SrTiO$_3$ (STO), we grew highly strained 1ML FeSe on the rectangular (100)
face of rutile TiO$_2$, and observed the coexistence of replica bands and
superconductivity with a $T_c$ of 63 K. From the similar $T_c$ between this
system and 1ML FeSe on STO (001), we conclude that strain and dielectric
constant are likely unimportant to the enhanced $T_c$ in these systems. A
systematic comparison of 1ML FeSe on TiO$_2$ with other systems in the FeSe
family shows that while charge transfer alone can enhance $T_c$, it is only
with the addition of interfacial electron-phonon coupling that $T_c$ can be
increased to the level seen in 1ML FeSe on STO.

stellar mass of ~7x10^11 Msun located at z_L=0.795. The system exhibits two
arcs/rings with clearly different colors, including several knots. We have
performed spectroscopic follow-up observations of the system with FIRE on
Magellan. The outer ring is confirmed at z_S2=1.988 with multiple emission
lines, while the inner arc and counterimage is confirmed at z_S1=1.302. This
makes it the first double source plane system with spectroscopic redshifts of
both sources. Interestingly, redshifts of two of the knots embedded in the
outer ring are found to be offset by delta_z=0.002 from the other knots,
suggesting that the outer ring consists of at least two distinct components in
the source plane. We perform lens modeling with two independent codes and
successfully reproduce the main features of the system. However, two of the
lensed sources separated by ~0.7 arcsec cannot be reproduced by a smooth

to reproduce them. Higher-resolution imaging of the system will help decipher
the origin of this lensing feature and potentially detect the substructure.

Relation extraction is the process of detecting and classifying the semantic

methods to create feature vector. These features are then fed to classifier for
the prediction of the correct class. It turns out that the results of these

particles in heavy-ion collisions. Quark coalescence is one of the approaches
to describe the elliptic flow of hadrons, while the production of light nuclei
can be also depicted as a coalescence of nucleons. In these proceedings, the

spontaneously rotate in the presence of a heat flux due to a temperature
gradient, a phenomenon known as Lehmann effect. So far, it is not clear whether
this effect is due to the chirality of the phase and the molecules or only to
the chirality of the director field. Here, we report the continuous rotation in
a temperature gradient of nematic droplets of a lyotropic chromonic liquid
crystal featuring a twisted bipolar configuration. The achiral nature of the
molecular components leads to a random handedness of the spontaneous twist,
resulting in the coexistence of droplets rotating in the two senses, with
speeds proportional to the temperature gradient and inversely proportional to
the droplet radius. This result shows that a macroscopic twist of the director
field is sufficient to induce a rotation of the droplets, and that the phase
and the molecules do not need to be chiral. This suggests that one can also
explain the Lehmann rotation in cholesteric liquid crystals without introducing
the Leslie thermomechanical coupling -- only present in chiral mesophases. An
explanation based on the Akopyan and Zeldovich theory of thermomechanical
effects in nematics is proposed and discussed.

estimators or their products (shear-shear correlation). The weighting schemes
are designed in the hope of minimizing the statistical error without
introducing systematic errors. It would be ideal to approach the Cramer-Rao
bound (the lower bound of the statistical uncertainty) in shear statistics,
though it is generally difficult to do so in practice. The reasons may include:
difficulties in galaxy shape measurement, inaccurate knowledge of the
probability-distribution-function (PDF) of the shear estimator,
misidentification of point sources as galaxies, etc.. Using the shear
estimators defined in Zhang et al. (2015), we show that one can overcome all
these problems, and allow shear measurement accuracy to approach the Cramer-Rao
bound. This can be achieved by symmetrizing the PDF of the shear estimator, or
the joint PDF of shear estimator pairs (for shear-shear correlation), without
any prior knowledge of the PDF. Using simulated galaxy images, we demonstrate
that under general observing conditions, this idea works as expected: it
minimizes the statistical uncertainty without introducing systematic error.

commuting diagrams, one for a least homomorphism and the other for a greatest,
much like in a system of (least and greatest) fixed-point equations. This
characterization works uniformly for the nondeterministic branching and the
probabilistic one; and for words and trees alike. We present our results in
terms of the parity acceptance condition that generalizes Buechi's.

with the emphasis on the fixed-precision problem and computational efficiency

factorization, where Q is an orthonormal matrix. Firstly, a mechanism for
calculating the approximation error in Frobenius norm is proposed, which
enables efficient adaptive rank determination for large and/or sparse matrix.
It can be combined with any QB-form factorization algorithm in which B's rows
are incrementally generated. Based on the blocked randQB algorithm by P.-G.
Martinsson and S. Voronin, this results in an algorithm called randQB EI. Then,
we further revise the algorithm to obtain a pass-efficient algorithm, randQB
FP, which is mathematically equivalent to the existing randQB algorithms and
also suitable for the fixed-precision problem. Especially, randQB FP can serve
as a single-pass algorithm for calculating leading singular values, under
certain condition. With large and/or sparse test matrices, we have empirically
validated the merits of the proposed techniques, which exhibit remarkable
speedup and memory saving over the blocked randQB algorithm. We have also
demonstrated that the single-pass algorithm derived by randQB FP is much more
accurate than an existing single-pass algorithm. And with data from a scenic
image and an information retrieval application, we have shown the advantages of
the proposed algorithms over the adaptive range finder algorithm for solving
the fixed-precision problem.

quantum states without referring to their particular physical representation.
In principle, quantum states can be therefore fully swapped between various
quantum systems by their mutual interaction and this quantum state transfer is
crucial for many quantum communication and information processing tasks. In
practice, however, the achievable interaction time and strength are often
limited by decoherence. Here we propose and experimentally demonstrate a
procedure for faithful quantum state transfer between two weakly interacting
qubits. Our scheme enables a probabilistic yet perfect unidirectional transfer
of an arbitrary unknown state of a source qubit onto a target qubit prepared
initially in a known state. The transfer is achieved by a combination of a
suitable measurement of the source qubit and quantum filtering on the target
qubit depending on the outcome of measurement on the source qubit. We
experimentally verify feasibility and robustness of the transfer using a linear
optical setup with qubits encoded into polarization states of single photons.

telescopes are limited at lower energies by the multiple scattering of
electrons in passive tungsten converter plates. This results in low angular
resolution, and, consequently, a drop in sensitivity to point sources below
1GeV. The polarisation information, which is carried by the azimuthal angle of
the conversion plane, is lost for the same reasons.
  HARPO (Hermetic ARgon POlarimeter) is an R\&D program to characterise the
operation of a gaseous detector (a Time Projection Chamber or TPC) as a high
angular-resolution and sensitivity telescope and polarimeter for $\gamma$ rays
from cosmic sources. It represents a first step towards a future space

  We built and characterised a 30cm cubic demonstrator [SPIE 91441M], and put
it in a polarised $\gamma$-ray beam at the NewSUBARU accelerator in Japan. Data
were taken at photon energies from 1.74MeV to 74MeV, and with different
polarisation configurations.
  We describe the experimental setup in beam. We then describe the software we
developed to reconstruct the photon conversion events, with special focus on
low energies. We also describe the thorough simulation of the detector used to
compare results. Finally we will present the performance of the detector as
extracted from this analysis and preliminary measurements of the polarisation

consider product partition models where it is possible to integrate out model
parameters for the regime between each changepoint, leaving a posterior
distribution over a latent vector indicating the presence or not of a
changepoint at each observation. The same problem setting has been considered
by Fearnhead (2006) where one can use filtering recursions to make exact
inference. However the complexity of this algorithm depends quadratically on
the number of observations. Our approach relies on an adaptive Markov Chain
Monte Carlo (MCMC) method for finite discrete state spaces. We develop an
adaptive algorithm which can learn from the past states of the Markov chain in
order to build proposal distributions which can quickly discover where
changepoint are likely to be located. We prove that our algorithm leaves the
posterior distribution ergodic. Crucially, we demonstrate that our adaptive
MCMC algorithm is viable for large datasets for which the filtering recursions
approach is not. Moreover, we show that inference is possible in a reasonable
time.

Our key tool is a new efficiently computable additive lower bound for the

can be used to evaluate the entanglement cost under local operations and
classical communication (LOCC). We find that for any rank-two mixed state
supporting on the $3\otimes3$ antisymmetric subspace, the amount of distillable
entanglement by PPT operations is strictly smaller than one entanglement bit
(ebit) while its entanglement cost under PPT operations is exactly one ebit. As

regularization, are strictly less than the asymptotic relative entropy of

was present in the pre-outburst state of V1309 Sco. Its high temperature
(900-1000 K) suggests that this was a freshly formed dust in a presumable
mass-loss from the spiralling-in binary. Shortly after its 2008 eruption,
V1309~Sco became almost completely embedded in dust. The parameters

excitation (for absorption features) and using a non-LTE model (for emission
features), adopting calculated collision data for H2O and OH+, and rough

that the nuclear region does not contribute much to the emission in these

the lines in diffuse gas, and the N(OH+)/N(H2O+) ratios of 1.6-3.1 indicate a
low H2 fraction (~11%) in the gas.

ionization efficiency, we find ionization rates for our sample galaxies of

its associated ions probe primarily non-nuclear gas in the disks of these
centrally active galaxies. Our data thus provide evidence for a decrease in
ionization rate by a factor of ~10 from the nuclei to the disks of galaxies, as
found before for the Milky Way.

stretchable elastomeric film as the platform, instead of the commonly used
rigid supports. Such a soft film impregnated with magnetic particles can be
modulated with an external electromagnetic field that produces a vast array of
topographical landscapes with varying surface curvature, which, in conjunction
with capillarity, can direct and control motion of water droplets efficiently
and accurately. When a thin layer of oil is present on this film that is
deformed locally, a centrosymmetric wedge is formed. A water droplet placed on
this oil laden film becomes asymmetrically deformed thus producing a gradient
of Laplace pressure within the droplet setting it to motion. A simple theory is
presented that accounts for the droplet speed in terms of such geometric
variables as the volume of the droplet and the thickness of the oil film
covering the soft elastomeric film, as well as such material variables as the
viscosity of the oil and interfacial tension of the oil-water interfaces.
Following the verification of the theoretical result using well-controlled
model systems, we demonstrate how the electromagnetically controlled
elasto-capillary force can be used to manipulate the motion of single and/or
multiple droplets on the surface of the elastomeric film and how such
elementary operations as drop fusion and thermally addressed chemical
transformation can be carried out in aqueous droplets. It is expected that the
resulting drop fluidics would be suitable for digital control of drop motion by
simply switching on and off the electromagnetic fields applied at different
positions underneath the elastomeric film. We anticipate that this method of
directing and manipulating water droplets is poised for its applications in
various biochemical reaction engineering, an example of which is Polymerase

density grows, the residue of the nucleon ground state decreases gradually

slightly. On the other hand, the positions of the peaks, which correspond to

dynamical conductivities become independent of the density and are universal in
this sense. The different limits of vanishing density, relaxation, frequency,

reduced by projection of the time reversed scattering wave functions on LEQ

couple of examples of possible applications of the theory, including current

that combine content (what is said), time (when), and user (by whom)
information. An important computational challenge is to analyze these data,
discover meaningful patterns, and understand what is happening. We consider the
problem of mining online communication data and finding top-k temporal events.
We define a temporal event to be a coherent topic that is discussed frequently,
in a relatively short time span, while the information ow of the event respects
the underlying network structure. We construct our model for detecting temporal
events in two steps. We first introduce the notion of interaction meta-graph,
which connects associated interactions. Using this notion, we define a temporal
event to be a subset of interactions that (i) are topically and temporally
close and (ii) correspond to a tree that captures the information ow. Finding
the best temporal event leads to budget version of the prize-collecting
Steiner-tree (PCST) problem, which we solve using three different methods: a
greedy approach, a dynamic-programming algorithm, and an adaptation to an
existing approximation algorithm. The problem of finding the top- k events
among a set of candidate events maps to maximum set-cover problem, and thus,
solved by greedy. We compare and analyze our algorithms in both synthetic and
real datasets, such as twitter and email communication. The results show that
our methods are able to detect meaningful temporal events.

30 671 K-type red giant branch stars is used to detect systematic large-scale
variations of the interstellar extinction law within the nearest kiloparsec.
The characteristic of the extinction law, the total-to-selective extinction
ratio $R_V$, which also characterizes the size and other properties of
interstellar dust grains, has been calculated for various regions of space by
the extinction law extrapolation method. The results for the two classes of
stars agree: the standard deviation of the ""red giants minus OB"" $R_V$
differences within 500 pc of the Sun is 0.2. The detected $R_V$ variations
between 2.2 and 4.4 not only manifest themselves in individual clouds but also
span the entire space near the Sun, following Galactic structures. In the Local
Bubble within about 100 pc of the Sun, $R_V$ has a minimum. In the inner part
of the Gould Belt and at high Galactic latitudes, at a distance of about 150 pc
from the Sun, $R_V$ reaches a maximum and then decreases to its minimum in the
outer part of the Belt and other directions at a distance of about 500 pc from
the Sun, returning to its mean values far from the Sun. The detected maximum of
$R_V$ at high Galactic latitudes is important when allowance is made for the
interstellar extinction toward extragalactic objects. In addition, a monotonic
increase in $R_V$ by 0.3 per kpc toward the Galactic center has been found near
the Galactic equator. It is consistent with the result obtained by Zasowski et
al. (2009) for much of the Galaxy. Ignoring the $R_V$ variations and
traditionally using a single value for the entire space must lead to systematic
errors in the calculated distances reaching 10\%.

Dirac's mapping. By addition of a background metric, one can construct a scalar

successfully solved in conformal variables because they are physical ones.
First, the intrinsic time as a logarithm of determinant of spatial metric, was
applied to a cosmological problem by Misner. A global time is exist under
condition of constant mean curvature slicing of spacetime. A volume of
hypersurface and the so-called mean York's time are canonical conjugated pair.
So, the volume is the intrinsic global time by its sense. The experimentally
observed redshift in cosmology is the evidence of its existence. An intrinsic
time of homogeneous models is global. The Friedmann equation by its sense ties
time intervals. Exact solutions of the Friedmann equation in Standard cosmology
with standard and conformal units are presented. Theoretical curves

analytical form. The class of functions in which the concordance model is
described is Weierstrass meromorphic functions. The Standard cosmological model
is used for fitting the modern Hubble diagram. The physical interpretation of

optimization. Rather than handling risk aversion in the objective, this enables
risk aversion by including dominance constraints that single out subsets of
nonanticipative shapes which compare favorably to a chosen stochastic
benchmark. This new class of stochastic shape optimization problems arises by
optimizing over such feasible sets. The analytical description is built on
risk-averse cost measures. The underlying cost functional is of compliance type
plus a perimeter term, in the implementation shapes are represented by a phase
field which permits an easy estimate of a regularized perimeter. The analytical
description and the numerical implementation of dominance constraints are built
on risk-averse measures for the cost functional. A suitable numerical

the impact of high variability of forces or probabilities in the different

equations for Compton scattering and compute the photon mean free path as a
function of photon energy by solving the corresponding integral equation in the

Rosseland mean opacity as a function of temperature and electron degeneracy. We
compare our results to the previous calculations and find a significant
difference in the low-temperature regime and strong degeneracy. We find useful
analytical expressions that approximate well the numerical results. We then
proceed to compute the flux mean opacity and show that in diffusion
approximation it is nearly identical to the Rosseland mean opacity. We also
provide a simple way for accounting for the true absorption in evaluation of
the Rosseland and flux mean opacities.

be a neutral pseudoscalar technipion $\tilde{\pi}^0$. We considered two
distinct minimal models for the dynamical electroweak symmetry breaking. Here
we concentrate only on two-flavor vector-like technicolor model and we assume
that the two-photon fusion is a dominant production mechanism. We include
contributions of $2 \to 1$, $2 \to 2$ and $2 \to 3$ partonic processes. All the
mechanisms give similar contributions to the cross section. With the strong
Yukawa (technipion-techniquark) coupling $g_{TC} \simeq 20$ we roughly obtain
the measured cross section of the ""signal"". With such value of $g_{TC}$ we get
a relatively small total decay width $\Gamma_{\rm tot}$. We discuss also the
size of the signal at lower energies (LHC, Tevatron) for $\gamma \gamma$ final
states, where the enhancement was not observed. We predict a measurable cross
section for neutral technipion production associated with one or two soft jets.
The technipion signal is compared with the Standard Model diphoton background
contributions. We observe the dominance of inelastic-inelastic $\gamma \gamma$
processes. We predict the signal cross section for purely exclusive $p p \to p
p \gamma \gamma$ procesess at $\sqrt{s}$ = 13 TeV to be about 0.2 fb. Such a
cross section would be, however, difficult to measure with the planned
integrated luminosity. We conclude that in all considered cases the signal is
below the background or/and below the threshold set by statistics although some
tension can be seen.

unique properties of metal nanoparticles and those of graphene, but also
additional novel properties due to the interaction between graphene and
nanoparticles. This study shows that gold nanoislands can be used to tailor the
local electronic properties of graphene. Graphene on crystalline gold
nanoislands exhibits moir\'e superlattices, which generate secondary Dirac
points in the local density of states. Conversely, the graphene covered gold
regions undergo a polycrystalline to Au(111) phase transition upon annealing.
Moreover, the nanoscale coexistence of moir\'e superlattices with different
moir\'e periodicities has also been revealed. Several of these moir\'e
periodicities are anomalously large, which cannot be explained by the standard
lattice mismatch between the graphene and the topmost Au(111) layers. Density
functional theory and molecular dynamics simulations show for the first time
that in such cases the graphene and the interfacial metallic layer is strained,
leading to distorted lattice constants, and consequently to reduced misfit.
Room temperature charge localization induced by a large wavelength moir\'e
pattern is also observed by scanning tunneling spectroscopy. These findings can
open a route towards the strain engineering of graphene/metal interfaces with
various moir\'e superlattices and tailored electronic properties for nanoscale
information coding.

models by Arenou et al. (1992) and Gontcharov (2009). In all cases, we have
found good agreement and show that there are no systematic errors in the new

that the map by Schlegel et al. (1998) reaches saturation near the Galactic
equator at $E_{(B-V)}>0.8^m$, has a zero-point error and systematic errors
gradually increasing with reddening, and among the analytical models those that
take into account the extinction in the Gould Belt are more accurate. Our
extinction map shows that it is determined by reddening variations at low
latitudes and $R_V$ variations at high ones. This naturally explains the
contradictory data on the correlation or anticorrelation between reddening and
$R_V$ available in the literature. There is a correlation in a thin layer near
the Galactic equator, because both reddening and $R_V$ here increase toward the
Galactic center. There is an anticorrelation outside this layer, because higher
values of $R_V$ correspond to lower reddening at high and middle latitudes.
Systematic differences in sizes and other properties of the dust grains in
different parts of the Galaxy manifest themselves in this way. The largest
structures within the nearest kiloparsec, including the Local Bubble, the Gould

zero temperature there is a special radius $l_c$ where the energy loss is
independent of different values of $(\theta,z)$. Also at zero temperature,
there is a crossover between a regime in which the energy loss is dominated by
the linear drag force and by the radiation because of the acceleration of the

to disorder reveals crucial information about the internal gap symmetries of
the condensate, and thereby the pairing mechanism itself. The destruction of
superconductivity by disorder is traditionally described by Abrikosov-Gor'kov
(AG) theory, which however ignores spatial modulations and ceases to be valid

effects of disorder on unconventional superconductors in the presence of
correlations, and explore a completely different disorder paradigm dominated by
strong deviations from standard AG theory due to generation of local bound
states and cooperative impurity behavior driven by Coulomb interactions.
Specifically we explain under which circumstances magnetic disorder acts as a
strong poison destroying high-Tc superconductivity at the sub-1% level, and
when non-magnetic disorder, counter-intuitively, hardly affects the
unconventional superconducting state while concomitantly inducing an
inhomogeneous full-volume magnetic phase. Recent experimental studies of

solve the linear elasticity equations on such models. In this paper, we
investigate some of the limits of the VEM method when used on reservoir models.
First, we demonstrate that care must be taken to make the method robust for
highly elongated cells, which is common in these applications, and show the
importance of calculating forces in terms of traction on the boundary of the
elements for elongated distorted cells. Second, we study the effect of
triangulations on the surfaces of curved faces, which also naturally occur in

distributions, has been the object of much work in the past several years. We
say that a Bell inequality is normalized if its absolute value does not exceed
1 for any classical (i.e. local) distribution. Upper and (almost) tight lower
bounds have been given for the quantum violation of these Bell inequalities in
terms of number of outputs of the distribution, number of inputs, and the
dimension of the shared quantum states. In this work, we revisit normalized
Bell inequalities together with another family: inefficiency-resistant Bell
inequalities. To be inefficiency-resistant, the Bell value must not exceed 1
for any local distribution, including those that can abort. This makes the Bell
inequality resistant to the detection loophole, while a normalized Bell
inequality is resistant to general local noise. Both these families of Bell
inequalities are closely related to communication complexity lower bounds. We
show how to derive large violations from any gap between classical and quantum
communication complexity, provided the lower bound on classical communication
is proven using these lower bound techniques. This leads to
inefficiency-resistant violations that can be exponential in the size of the
inputs. Finally, we study resistance to noise and inefficiency for these Bell
inequalities.

`melted' states characterized by exponentially-decaying correlations, as is the
case for finite-temperature equilibrium situations. An important exception to
this rule are states which, while being at high energy, maintain a low entropy.
Such states can interestingly still display features of quantum criticality,
especially in one dimension. Here, we consider high-energy states in
anisotropic Heisenberg quantum spin chains obtained by splitting the ground
state's magnon Fermi sea into separate pieces. Using methods based on
integrability, we provide a detailed study of static and dynamical spin-spin
correlations. These carry distinctive signatures of the Fermi sea splittings,
which would be observable in eventual experimental realizations. Going further,
we employ a multi-component Tomonaga-Luttinger model in order to predict the
asymptotics of static correlations. For this effective field theory, we fix all
universal exponents from energetics, and all non-universal correlation
prefactors using finite-size scaling of matrix elements. The correlations
obtained directly from integrability and those emerging from the Luttinger
field theory description are shown to be in extremely good correspondence, as
expected, for the large distance asymptotics, but surprisingly also for the
short distance behavior. Finally, we discuss the description of dynamical
correlations from a mobile impurity model, and clarify the relation of the
effective field theory parameters to the Bethe Ansatz solution.

transistors (FETs). A potential difference applied between certain ionic
bilayers made from insulating graphitic materials such as BN, ZnO and AlN could
reduce gap sizes, turning them into useful semiconductors. On the other hand,
opening of a small semiconducting gap occurs in graphene bilayers under applied
field. The aim here is to investigate to what extent substrate induced
electron-phonon interactions (EPIs) modify this gap change. We examine EPIs in
several lattice configurations, using a perturbative approach. The typical
effect of EPIs on the ionic bilayers is an undesirable gap widening. The size
of this gap change varies considerably with lattice structure and the magnitude
of the bias. When bias is larger than the non-interacting gap size, EPIs have
the smallest effect on the bandgap, especially in configurations with
$AA^{\prime}$ and $AB$ structures. Thus careful selection of substrate, lattice
configuration and bias strength to minimise the effects of EPIs could be
important for optimising the properties of electronic devices. We use
parameters related to BN in this article. In practice, the results presented
here are broadly applicable to other graphitic bilayers, and are likely to be

to measure obscuration of UV luminosity by the dust which produces IR
luminosity. Quasar counts at rest frame 7.8 um are determined for quasars in
the Bootes field of the NOAO Deep Wide Field Survey using 24 um sources with
optical redshifts from the AGN and Galaxy Evolution Survey (AGES) or infrared
redshifts from the Spitzer Infrared Spectrograph. Spectral energy distributions
are extended to far infrared wavelengths using observations from the Herschel
Space Observatory Spectral and Photometric Imaging Receiver (SPIRE), and new
SPIRE photometry is presented for 77 high redshift quasars from the Sloan
Digital Sky Survey. It is found that unobscured and obscured quasars have
similar space densities at rest frame 7.8 um, but the ratio Lv(100 um)/Lv(7.8
um) is about three times higher for obscured quasars compared to unobscured, so
that far infrared or submm discoveries are dominated by obscured quasars.

European project DELICAT. With its forward-pointing architecture it aims at
demonstrating a novel detection scheme for clear air turbulence (CAT) for an
aeronautics safety application. Due to its occurrence in clear and clean air at
high altitudes (aviation cruise flight level), this type of turbulence evades
microwave radar techniques and in most cases coherent Doppler lidar techniques.
The present lidar detection technique relies on air density fluctuations
measurement and is thus independent of backscatter from hydrometeors and
aerosol particles. The subtle air density fluctuations caused by the turbulent
air flow demand exceptionally high stability of the setup and in particular of
the detection system. This paper describes an airborne test system for the
purpose of demonstrating this technology and turbulence detection method: a
high-power UV Rayleigh lidar system is installed on a research aircraft in a
forward-looking configuration for use in cruise flight altitudes. Flight test
measurements demonstrate this unique lidar system being able to resolve air
density fluctuations occurring in light-to-moderate CAT at 5 km or moderate CAT
at 10 km distance. A scaling of the determined stability and noise
characteristics shows that such performance is adequate for an application in
commercial air transport.

Yet, the physical mechanisms involved in their formation are still debated.
Using a parsec-resolution hydrodynamical simulation of a dwarf galaxy, we
propose an updated formation scenario for NCs. In this 'wet migration
scenario', a massive star cluster forms in the gas-rich disc, keeping a gas
reservoir, and growing further while it migrates to the centre via a
combination of interactions with other substructures and dynamical friction. A
wet merger with another dense cluster and its own gas reservoir can occur,
although this is not a pre-requisite for the actual formation of the NC. The
merging process does significantly alter the properties of the NC (mass,
morphology, star formation history), also quenching the on-going local star
formation activity, thus leading to interesting observational diagnostics for
the physical origin of NCs. A population of lower mass clusters co-exist during
the simulation, but these are either destroyed via tidal forces, or have high
angular momentum preventing them to interact with the NC and contribute to its
growth. The proposed updated scenario emphasises the role of gas reservoirs
associated with the densest star clusters formed in a gas-rich low-mass galaxy.

a nonzero linear momentum. These are solutions of an Einstein-Proca-dilaton
model that can be obtained by Scherk-Schwarz circle reduction of AdS_5 gravity
coupled to a free real scalar field. The boundary of a bulk Lifshitz space-time
is a Newton-Cartan geometry. We show that the fluid dual to the moving Lifshitz
black brane leads to a novel form of Lifshitz hydrodynamics on a Newton-Cartan
space-time. Since the linear momentum of the black brane cannot be obtained by
a boost transformation the velocity of the fluid or rather, by boundary
rotational invariance, its magnitude plays the role of a chemical potential.
The conjugate dual variable is mass density. The Lifshitz perfect fluid can be
thought of as arising from a Schroedinger perfect fluid with broken particle
number symmetry.

personal identifiers, including health, age, and ability. Understanding and
quantifying these differences is a necessary first step towards developing
predictive methods derived from network topology. Here, we present a method to
quantify individual differences in brain functional dynamics by applying
hypergraph analysis, a method from dynamic network theory. Using a summary
metric derived from the hypergraph formalism---hypergraph cardinality---we
investigate individual variations in two separate and complementary data sets.
The first data set (""multi-task"") consists of 77 individuals engaging in four
consecutive cognitive tasks. We observed that hypergraph cardinality exhibits
variation across individuals while remaining consistent within individuals
between tasks; moreover, one of the memory tasks evinced a marginally
significant correspondence between hypergraph cardinality and age. This finding
motivated a similar analysis of the second data set (""age-memory""), in which 95
individuals of varying ages performed a memory task with a similar structure to
the multi-task memory task. With the increased age range in the age-memory data
set, the correlation between hypergraph cardinality and age correspondence
becomes significant. We discuss these results in the context of the well-known
finding linking age with network structure, and suggest that age-related
changes in brain function can be better understood by taking an integrative
approach that incorporates information about the dynamics of functional
interactions.

of Helmholtz problems posed in exterior domains. The problem is formulated as a
nonlinear eigenvalue problem (NEP), where the nonlinearity arises from the use
of a Dirichlet-to-Neumann map, which accounts for modeling unbounded domains.
We consider a variational formulation and show that the spectrum consists of
isolated eigenvalues of finite multiplicity that only can accumulate at
infinity. The proposed method is based on a high order finite element
discretization combined with a specialization of the Tensor Infinite Arnoldi
method. Using Toeplitz matrices, we show how to specialize this method to our
specific structure. In particular we introduce a pole cancellation technique in
order to increase the radius of convergence for computation of eigenvalues that
lie close to the poles of the matrix-valued function. The solution scheme can
be applied to multiple resonators with a varying refractive index that is not
necessarily piecewise constant. We present two test cases to show stability,
performance and numerical accuracy of the method. In particular the use of a
high order finite element discretization together with TIAR results in an
efficient and reliable method to compute resonances.
