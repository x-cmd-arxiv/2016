shift the topological surface states down about 0.5 eV below the Fermi energy

their helical spin structure. The band alignment of Bi2Se3 and Ni (Co) places
the Fermi energy far in the conduction band of bulk Bi2Se3, where the spin of

critically-enhanced bulk viscosity induces a substantial non-equilibrium
pressure, effectively softening the equation of state, and leads to sizable
effects in the flow velocity and single particle distributions at the
freeze-out. The observable effects that may arise due to the enhanced bulk
viscosity in the vicinity of the QCD critical point can be used as
complimentary information to facilitate searches for the QCD critical point.

breaks the bipartite nature of the honeycomb lattice, has been recently
demonstrated. Here we address how the electronic and spin properties of these

interactions as well as the emergent edge magnetism, studied both with DFT and
mean field Hubbard model calculations. In all instances we find that the local
breakdown of the bipartite nature at the defect reverts the sign of the
otherwise ferromagnetic correlations along the edge, introducing a locally
antiferromagnetic intra-edge coupling and, for narrow ribbons, also revert the
antiferromagnetic inter-edge interactions that are normally found in pristine

permits to engineer the spin exchange interactions in graphene based
nano-structures.

learn the high-level coarse tokens, but we argue that a simple extraction
procedure is sufficient to capture a wealth of high-level discourse semantics.
Such procedure allows training the multiresolution recurrent neural network by
maximizing the exact joint log-likelihood over both sequences. In contrast to
the standard log- likelihood objective w.r.t. natural language tokens (word
perplexity), optimizing the joint log-likelihood biases the model towards
modeling high-level abstractions. We apply the proposed model to the task of
dialogue response generation in two challenging domains: the Ubuntu technical
support domain, and Twitter conversations. On Ubuntu, the model outperforms
competing approaches by a substantial margin, achieving state-of-the-art
results according to both automatic evaluation metrics and a human evaluation
study. On Twitter, the model appears to generate more relevant and on-topic
responses according to automatic evaluation metrics. Finally, our experiments
demonstrate that the proposed model is more adept at overcoming the sparsity of

close binaries to measure apparent and/or real variations in their orbital
periods. Our programme includes 67 close binaries, both detached and
semi-detached and with M-dwarfs, K-dwarfs, brown dwarfs or white dwarfs
secondaries. In total, we have observed more than 650 white dwarf eclipses. We
use this sample to search for orbital period variations and aim to identify the
underlying cause of these variations. We find that the probability of observing
orbital period variations increases significantly with the observational
baseline. In particular, all binaries with baselines exceeding 10 yrs, with
secondaries of spectral type K2 -- M5.5, show variations in the eclipse arrival
times that in most cases amount to several minutes. In addition, among those
with baselines shorter than 10 yrs, binaries with late spectral type (>M6),
brown dwarf or white dwarf secondaries appear to show no orbital period
variations. This is in agreement with the so-called Applegate mechanism, which
proposes that magnetic cycles in the secondary stars can drive variability in
the binary orbits. We also present new eclipse times of NN Ser, which are still
compatible with the previously published circumbinary planetary system model,
although only with the addition of a quadratic term to the ephemeris. Finally,
we conclude that we are limited by the relatively short observational baseline
for many of the binaries in the eclipse timing programme, and therefore cannot
yet draw robust conclusions about the cause of orbital period variations in
evolved, white dwarf binaries.

The A-model side enumerative problem consists of counting cell graphs where in
addition vertices are decorated by elements in a Frobenius algebra, and which
are a twisted version of the generalized Catalan numbers of
Dumitrescu-Mulase-Safnuk-Sorkin. We show that the function which counts these
decorated graphs satisfies a twisted version of the same type of recursion of
Catalan numbers with respect to the edge-contraction axioms of
Dumitrescu-Mulase. The path we follow to pass from the A-model side to the
remodelled B-model side is to use a discrete Laplace transform based on the
ideas of the group of Mulase. We show that a twisted version by a 2D TQFT of
the Eynard-Orantin differentials satisfies a twisted generalization of the
topological recursion formula. We shall illustrate these results with a toy
model for the theory arising from the orbifold cohomology of the classifying
space of a finite group. In this example, the graphs are drawn on an orbifold
punctured Riemann surface and defined out of the moduli space of stable
morphisms from twisted curves to the classifying space of a finite group. In
particular we show that the cotangent class intersection numbers on this moduli
space satisfy a twisted Eynard-Orantin topological recursion and we derive an
orbifold DVV equation as a consequence of it. This proves from a different

intersection numbers on that moduli space satisfy the Virasoro constraint
condition.

as the proton driver to create a plasma wakefield which then accelerates
electrons to 3\,TeV, these then colliding with the other 7 TeV LHC proton beam.
Although of very high energy, the collider has a modest projected integrated
luminosity of $10-100$ pb$^{-1}$. For such a collider, with a centre-of-mass
energy 30 times greater than HERA, parton momentum fractions, $x$, down to
about $10^{-8}$ are accessible for photon virtualities, $Q^2$, of 1 GeV$^2$.
The energy dependence of hadronic cross sections at high energies, such as the
the total photon--proton cross section, which has synergy with cosmic-ray
physics, can be measured and QCD and the structure of matter better understood
in a region where the effects are completely unknown. Searches at high $Q^2$
for physics beyond the Standard Model will be possible, in particular the
significantly increased sensitivity to the production of leptoquarks. These and
other physics highlights of a very high energy electron--proton collider are

this paper, we explore how much this effect can be mitigated by focusing on a
specific instrument class and making use of additional information on the

efficiently generate accurate posterior samples under arbitrary target priors.
Prior swapping lets us apply less-costly inference algorithms to certain

they solely depend on the surface. For a given ray, the bottleneck is equation
solving. Our Maple code handles bicubic patches in $\le 1$~sec, though
numerical issues might arise. Our second contribution is to extend the method
to parametric space curves and, generally, to codimension $> 1$, by computing
the equations of (hyper)surfaces intersecting precisely at the given object. By
means of Chow forms, we propose a new, practical, randomized algorithm that
always produces correct output but possibly with a non-minimal number of
surfaces. For space curves, we obtain 3 surfaces whose polynomials are of
near-optimal degree; in this case, computation reduces to a Sylvester

cosmological simulations has motivated significant developments in both
numerical methods and physical models in recent years. We investigate these two
fundamental aspects in a new comparison project using a set of cosmological
hydrodynamic simulations of the formation and evolution of a Milky Way-size
galaxy. In this study, we focus on the comparison of two particle-based
hydrodynamics methods: the improved smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) code
Gadget, and the Lagrangian Meshless Finite-Mass (MFM) code GIZMO. All the
simulations in this paper use the same initial conditions and physical models,
which include physics of both dark matter and baryons, star formation,
""energy-driven"" outflow, metal-dependent cooling, stellar evolution and metal
enrichment from supernovae. We find that both numerical schemes produce a
late-type galaxy with extended gaseous and stellar disks. However, notable
differences are present in a wide range of galaxy properties and their
evolution, including star formation history, gas content, disk structure and
kinematics. In particular, there is significant difference in gas properties
and their evolution between the two simulations. Compared to GIZMO, Gadget
simulation produces a larger fraction of cold, dense gas at high redshift which
fuels rapid star formation and results in a higher stellar mass by $20\%$ and a
lower gas fraction by $10\%$ at $z = 0$, and the resulting gas disk is smoother
and more coherent in rotation due to damping of turbulent motion by the
numerical viscosity in SPH, in contrast to the GIZMO simulation which shows
more prominent spiral structure. Given its better convergence properties and
lower computational cost, we argue that MFM method is a promising alternative
to the widely used SPH in cosmological hydrodynamic simulations.

properties of the spacetime under study. In the first part, we investigate
scalar and Proca fields on an asymptotically flat background. For the Proca
field, we obtain a complete set of equations of motion in higher dimensional
spherically symmetric backgrounds. These equations are solved numerically, both
to compute Hawking radiation spectra and quasi-bound states. In the former
case, we carry out a precise study of the longitudinal degrees of freedom
induced by the field mass. This can be used to improve the model in the black
hole event generators currently used at the Large Hadron Collider. Regarding
quasi-bound states, we find arbitrarily long lived modes for a charged Proca
field, as well as for a charged scalar field, in a Reissner-Nordstr\""om black
hole. The second part of this thesis presents research on superradiant
instabilities of scalar and Maxwell fields on an asymptotically anti-de Sitter
background. For the scalar case, we introduce a charge coupling between the
field and the background, and show that superradiant instabilities do exist for
all $\ell$ modes, in higher dimensions. For the Maxwell case, we first propose
a general prescription to impose boundary conditions on the Kerr-anti-de Sitter
spacetime, and obtain two Robin boundary conditions. Then these two conditions
are implemented to study superradiant unstable modes and vector clouds. In
particular, we find that the new branch of quasinormal modes may be unstable in
a larger parameter space. Furthermore, the existence of vector clouds indicates
that one may find a vector hairy black hole solution for the
Einstein-Maxwell-anti-de Sitter system at the nonlinear level, which implies
that, in such system, the Kerr-Newman-anti-de Sitter black hole is not a unique

signal processing might be integrated with biologically motivated mechanisms
such as neural networks. This paper explores a novel hybrid approach for
classifying segments of sequential data, such as individual spoken works. The
approach combines a hidden Markov model (HMM) with a spiking neural network
(SNN). The HMM, consisting of states and transitions, forms a fixed backbone
with nonadaptive transition probabilities. The SNN, however, implements a
biologically based Bayesian computation that derives from the spike
timing-dependent plasticity (STDP) learning rule. The emission (observation)
probabilities of the HMM are represented in the SNN and trained with the STDP
rule. A separate SNN, each with the same architecture, is associated with each
of the states of the HMM. Because of the STDP training, each SNN implements an
expectation maximization algorithm to learn the emission probabilities for one
HMM state. The model was studied on synthesized spike-train data and also on
spoken word data. Preliminary results suggest its performance compares
favorably with other biologically motivated approaches. Because of the model's
uniqueness and initial promise, it warrants further study. It provides some new
ideas on how the brain might implement the equivalent of an HMM in a neural
circuit.

instability turns on at extrema of the mass curve. Linear stability extends to
nonlinear stability up to some threshold for the amplitude of the perturbation.
Beyond that, the soliton is destroyed and collapses to a hairy black hole. The
relative width of this stability band scales down with the charge Q, and does
not survive the blow up limit to a planar geometry.

Evolutionary tracks computed with overshooting are quite different from those
that use the classical Schwarzschild criterion, which leads to rather different
predictions for the stellar properties. Attempts over the last two decades to
calibrate the degree of overshooting with stellar mass using detached
double-lined eclipsing binaries have been largely inconclusive, mainly due to a
lack of suitable observational data. Here we revisit the question of a possible
mass dependence of overshooting with a more complete sample of binaries, and
examine any additional relation there might be with evolutionary state or metal
abundance Z. We use a carefully selected sample of 33 double-lined eclipsing
binaries strategically positioned in the H-R diagram, with accurate absolute
dimensions and component masses ranging from 1.2 to 4.4 solar masses. We
compare their measured properties with stellar evolution calculations to infer
semi-empirical values of the overshooting parameter alpha(ov) for each star.
Our models use the common prescription for the overshoot distance d(ov) =
alpha(ov) Hp, where Hp is the pressure scale height at the edge of the
convective core as given by the Schwarzschild criterion, and alpha(ov) is a
free parameter. We find a relation between alpha(ov) and mass that is defined
much more clearly than in previous work, and indicates a significant rise up to
about 2 solar masses followed by little or no change beyond this mass. No
appreciable dependence is seen with evolutionary state at a given mass, or with
metallicity at a given mass despite the fact that the stars in our sample span
a range of a factor of ten in [Fe/H], from -1.01 to +0.01.

some degree of energy equipartition, we use the relation sigma~M^-eta, where
eta is related to the degree of energy equipartition, along with our

an equation of state and a sound speed, both of them functions of the number of
$e$-folds and four phenomenological parameters. This approach captures a number
of possible inflationary models, including those with non-canonical kinetic
terms or scale-dependent non-gaussianities. We perform Markov Chain Monte Carlo
analyses using the latest cosmological publicly available measurements, which
include Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) data from the Planck satellite.
Within this parametrization, we discard scale invariance with a significance of
about $10\sigma$, and the running of the spectral index is constrained as
$\alpha_s=-0.60\,^{+0.08}_{-0.10}\times 10^{-3}$ ($68\%$~CL errors). The limit
on the tensor-to-scalar ratio is $r<0.005$ at $95\%$~CL from CMB data alone. We
find no significant evidence for this alternative parameterization with present
cosmological observations. The maximum amplitude of the equilateral
non-gaussianity that we obtain, $|f^{\text{equil}}_{\text{NL}}|< 1$, is much
smaller than the current Planck mission errors, strengthening the case for
future high-redshift, all-sky surveys, which could reach the required accuracy
on equilateral non-gaussianities.

emission from all four systems, indicating that neutron star companions are
extremely unlikely and that the companions are almost certainly white dwarfs.
Given the observed orbital periods and radial velocity amplitudes, the total
masses of these binaries are greater than 1.02 to 1.39 Msun. The extreme mass
ratios between the two components make it unlikely that these binary white
dwarfs will merge and explode as Type Ia or underluminous supernovae. Instead,
they will likely go through stable mass transfer through an accretion disk and
turn into interacting AM CVn. Along with three previously known systems, we
identify two of our targets, J0811 and J2132, as systems that will definitely
undergo stable mass transfer. In addition, we use the binary white dwarf sample
from the ELM Survey to constrain the inspiral rate of systems with extreme mass
ratios. This rate, 0.00017/year, is consistent with the AM CVn space density
estimated from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. Hence, stable mass transfer double
white dwarf progenitors can account for the entire AM CVn population in the
Galaxy.

physical scenario in which X-ray reflection occurs in the inner part of the
accretion disc of AGN, the X-ray reflection component should be a filtered echo
of the X-ray continuum signal and should be equal to the convolution of the
primary emission with the response function of the disc. Our primary objective
is to search for these reflection features in the 5-7 keV (iron line) and 0.5-1
keV (soft) bands, where the X-ray reflection fraction is expected to be
dominant. We fit to the observed periodograms two models: a simple bending
power law model (BPL) and a BPL model convolved with the transfer function of
the accretion disc assuming the lamp-post geometry and X-ray reflection from a
homogeneous disc. We do not find any significant features in the best-fitting
BPL model residuals either in individual PSDs in the iron band, soft and full
band (0.3-10 keV) or in the average PSD residuals of the brightest and more
variable sources (with similar black hole mass estimates). The typical
amplitude of the soft and full-band residuals is around 3-5 per cent. It is
possible that the expected general relativistic effects are not detected
because they are intrinsically lower than the uncertainty of the current PSDs,
even in the strong relativistic case in which X-ray reflection occurs on a disc
around a fast rotating black hole having an X-ray source very close above it.
However, we could place strong constrains to the X-ray reflection geometry with
the current data sets if we knew in advance the intrinsic shape of the X-ray
PSDs, particularly its high frequency slope.

Poisson manifolds. A direct application of our results give the construction of
a family of Poisson integrators, that is, integrators that conserve the

a ConvNet and a 3D mean face model in an end-to-end multi-task discriminative

used the one provided in the AFLW dataset). The ConvNet consists of two
components: (i) The face pro- posal component computes face bounding box
proposals via estimating facial key-points and the 3D transformation (rotation
and translation) parameters for each predicted key-point w.r.t. the 3D mean
face model. (ii) The face verification component computes detection results by
prun- ing and refining proposals based on facial key-points based configuration
pooling. The proposed method addresses two issues in adapting state- of-the-art
generic object detection ConvNets (e.g., faster R-CNN) for face detection: (i)
One is to eliminate the heuristic design of prede- fined anchor boxes in the
region proposals network (RPN) by exploit- ing a 3D mean face model. (ii) The
other is to replace the generic RoI (Region-of-Interest) pooling layer with a
configuration pooling layer to respect underlying object structures. The
multi-task loss consists of three terms: the classification Softmax loss and
the location smooth l1 -losses [14] of both the facial key-points and the face
bounding boxes. In ex- periments, our ConvNet is trained on the AFLW dataset
only and tested on the FDDB benchmark with fine-tuning and on the AFW benchmark
without fine-tuning. The proposed method obtains very competitive
state-of-the-art performance in the two benchmarks.

CFS instability requires, in an essential way, the loss of angular momentum by
gravitational radiation and, in many instances, it acts on too long a timescale
to be physically/astrophysically relevant. It is therefore of interest to
examine the stability of rotating, relativistic stars to axisymmetric
perturbations, where the CFS instability does not occur. In this paper, we
provide a Rayleigh-Ritz type variational principle for testing the stability of
perfect fluid stars to axisymmetric perturbations, which generalizes to
axisymmetric perturbations of rotating stars a variational principle given by
Chandrasekhar for spherical perturbations of static, spherical stars. Our
variational principle provides a lower bound to the rate of exponential growth
in the case of instability. The derivation closely parallels the derivation of

by electrostatic drift-waves is presented. The study is based on a reduced
discrete Hamiltonian dynamical system known as the gyro-averaged standard map
(GSM). In this system, FLR effects are incorporated through the gyro-averaging
of a simplified weak-turbulence model of electrostatic fluctuations. Formally,
the GSM is a modified version of the standard map in which the perturbation
amplitude, $K_0$, becomes $K_0 J_0(\hat{\rho})$, where $J_0$ is the
zeroth-order Bessel function and $\hat{\rho}$ is the Larmor radius. Assuming a
Maxwellian probability density function (pdf) for $\hat{\rho}$, we compute
analytically and numerically the pdf and the cumulative distribution function
of the effective drift-wave perturbation amplitude $K_0 J_0(\hat{\rho})$. Using
these results we compute the probability of loss of confinement (i.e., global
chaos), $P_{c}$, and the probability of trapping in the main drift-wave
resonance, $P_{t}$. It is shown that $P_{c}$ provides an upper bound for the
escape rate, and that $P_{t}$ provides a good estimate of the particle trapping
rate. The analytical results are compared with direct numerical Monte-Carlo
simulations of particle transport.

central colors are flattish, become steeply redder to the surface brightness
break, then remain roughly constant beyond, similar to spiral TypeIII color
profiles, but without the central outward bluing. Faint (-9 > M_B > -14) Type
II dwarfs tend to have continuously red or ""U"" shaped colors and steeper color
slopes than bright (-14 > M_B > -19) Type II dwarfs, which additionally have
colors that become bluer or remain constant with increasing radius. Sm dwarfs
and BCDs tend to have at least some blue and red radial color trend,
respectively. Additionally, we determine stellar surface mass density (Sigma)
profiles and use them to show that the break in Sigma generally remains in Type
II dwarfs (unlike Type II spirals) but generally disappears in Type III dwarfs
(unlike Type III spirals). Moreover, the break in Sigma is strong,
intermediate, and weak in faint dwarfs, bright dwarfs, and spirals,
respectively, indicating that Sigma may straighten with increasing galaxy mass.
Lastly, the average stellar surface mass density at the surface brightness

lines originating from interaction with circumstellar matter (CSM; i.e., SN
Ia/IIn or SN Ia-CSM). Based on deep nondetections 27 days before discovery, we
infer that this SN was discovered around or slightly before optical maximum,
and we estimate the approximate time that it reached R-band maximum based on
comparison with other SNe Ia/IIn. In terms of spectral morphology, we find that
PS15si can be matched to a range of SN Ia spectral types, although SN
1991T-like SNe Ia provides the most self-consistent match. While this
observation agrees with analysis of most other SNe Ia/IIn, we find that the
implied CSM luminosity is too low to account for the overall luminosity of the
SN at a time when the CSM should outshine the underlying SN by a few
magnitudes. We infer that the similarity between PS15si and the hot,
overluminous, high-ionisation spectrum of SN 1991T is a consequence of a
spectrum that originates in ejecta layers that are heated by ultraviolet/X-ray
radiation from CSM interaction. In addition, PS15si may have rebrightened over
a short timescale in the B and V bands around 85 days after discovery, perhaps
indicating that the SN ejecta are interacting with a local enhancement in CSM
produced by clumps or a shell at large radii.

give rise to different kinds of Pfaffian states. In addition to the well known
Moore-Read Pfaffian and anti-Pfaffian states, a new putative particle-hole
symmetric Pfaffian state, corresponding to the $s-$wave pairing channel, was
also proposed. However, the possible underlying pairing mechanism is not clear
at all. In this work we provide a specific pairing mechanism for realizing some
of these Pfaffian states. We show that there can be nonzero pairing in angular
momentum channels $|\ell|\ge 1$ depending on the magnitude of a coupling
constant. There is a quantum phase transition from the Dirac composite fermi
liquid state to Cooper pairing states in angular momentum channels $|\ell|\ge
1$ as the coupling constant is tuned across its critical point value.
Surprisingly the particle-hole symmetric $\ell=0$ channel pairing turns out to
be impossible irrespective of the size of the coupling constant.

Bayesian setting shows advantage in recovering under-sampled sparse signals
from corrupted observations. Compared to conventional convex optimization
methods, it has a much lower complexity and is computationally tractable. In
the GAMP framework, the sparse signal and the observation are viewed to be
generated according to some pre-specified probability distributions in the
input and output channels. However, the parameters of the distributions are
usually unknown in practice. In this paper, we propose an extended GAMP
algorithm with built-in parameter estimation (PE-GAMP) and present its
empirical convergence analysis. PE-GAMP treats the parameters as unknown random
variables with simple priors and jointly estimates them with the sparse
signals. Compared with Expectation Maximization (EM) based parameter estimation
methods, the proposed PE-GAMP could draw information from the prior
distributions of the parameters to perform parameter estimation. It is also
more robust and much simpler, which enables us to consider more complex signal
distributions apart from the usual Bernoulli-Gaussian (BGm) mixture
distribution. Specifically, the formulations of Bernoulli-Exponential mixture
(BEm) distribution and Laplace distribution are given in this paper. Simulated
noiseless sparse signal recovery experiments demonstrate that the performance
of the proposed PE-GAMP matches the oracle GAMP algorithm. When noise is
present, both the simulated experiments and the real image recovery experiments
show that PE-GAMP is still able to maintain its robustness and outperform EM
based parameter estimation method when the sampling ratio is small.
Additionally, using the BEm formulation of the PE-GAMP, we can successfully
perform non-negative sparse coding of local image patches and provide useful
features for the image classification task.

independent of this basis choice. The basis choice is associated with a
particular truncation of the adiabatic expansion. The adiabatic expansion is
divergent, and we show that if this divergent expansion is truncated at its
optimal order, a universal time dependence is obtained, confirming a general
result of Dingle and Berry. This optimally truncated particle number provides a
clear picture of quantum interference effects for perturbations with
non-trivial temporal sub-structure. We illustrate these results using several
equivalent definitions of adiabatic particle number: the Bogoliubov, Riccati,
Spectral Function and Schrodinger picture approaches. In each approach, the
particle number may be expressed in terms of the tiny deviations between the
exact and adiabatic solutions of the Ermakov-Milne equation for the associated
time-dependent oscillators.

the cavity-mode wave length that competes with the optical lattice arrangement.
Simultaneously short-range interactions via particle hopping promote superfluid
order, such that a variety of structural and quantum coherent phases can occur.
We analyze the emerging phase diagram in two dimensions by means of an extended
Bose-Hubbard model using a local mean field approach combined with a superfluid
cluster analysis. For commensurate ratios of the cavity and external lattice
wave lengths the Mott insulator-superfluid transition is modified by the
appearance of charge density wave and supersolid phases, at which the atomic
density supports the buildup of a cavity field. For incommensurate ratios, the
optomechanical forces induce the formation of Bose-glass and superglass phases,
namely non-superfluid and superfluid phases, respectively, displaying
quasi-periodic density modulations, which in addition can exhibit structural
and superfluid stripe formation. The onset of such structures is constrained by
the onsite interaction and is favourable at fractional densities. Experimental
observables are identified and discussed.

have substantial practical merit. First, we highlight convolution with
upsampled filters, or 'atrous convolution', as a powerful tool in dense
prediction tasks. Atrous convolution allows us to explicitly control the
resolution at which feature responses are computed within Deep Convolutional
Neural Networks. It also allows us to effectively enlarge the field of view of
filters to incorporate larger context without increasing the number of
parameters or the amount of computation. Second, we propose atrous spatial
pyramid pooling (ASPP) to robustly segment objects at multiple scales. ASPP
probes an incoming convolutional feature layer with filters at multiple
sampling rates and effective fields-of-views, thus capturing objects as well as
image context at multiple scales. Third, we improve the localization of object
boundaries by combining methods from DCNNs and probabilistic graphical models.
The commonly deployed combination of max-pooling and downsampling in DCNNs
achieves invariance but has a toll on localization accuracy. We overcome this
by combining the responses at the final DCNN layer with a fully connected
Conditional Random Field (CRF), which is shown both qualitatively and

extension to the Standard Model where both are achieved by adding an extra new

heavy WIMPzilla dark matter, which has mass greater than ~10^7 GeV and must be
produced before reheating ends. Naturally, we refer to this scenario as
GUTzilla dark matter. Here we present a minimal GUTzilla model, adding a
vector-like quark multiplet to the Standard Model. Proton decay constraints
require the new multiplet to be both color and electroweak charged, which
prompts us to include a new confining SU(3) gauge group that binds the
multiplet into a neutral composite dark matter candidate. Current direct
detection constraints are evaded due to the large dark matter mass; meanwhile,
next-generation direct detection and proton decay experiments will probe much
of the parameter space. The relic abundance is strongly dependent on the
dynamics of the hidden confining sector, and we show that dark matter
production during the epoch of reheating can give the right abundance.

with the remover inserted for 80 s and used at either 80 cm or 65 cm from the

proposed scheme, pilots are transmitted in partial overlap with data to
decrease the channel estimation overhead. The RS can detect the source data
with minimal destination pilot interference by exploiting the asymptotic
orthogonality of massive MIMO channels. Then pilot-data interference can be
effectively suppressed with assistance of the detected source data in the
destination channel estimation. Due to the transmission overlay, the effective
data period is extended, hence improving system throughput. Both theoretical
and simulation results confirm that the proposed pilot-data overlay scheme
outperforms the conventional separate pilot-data design in the limited
coherence time interval scenario. Moreover, asymptotic analyses at high and low
SNR regions demonstrate the superiority of the proposed scheme regardless of
the coherence interval length. Because of simultaneous transmission, the proper
allocation of source data transmission and relay data forwarding power can
further improve the system performance. Hence a power allocation problem is
formulated and a successive convex approximation approach is proposed to solve
the non-convex optimization problem with the FD pilot-data transmission
overlay.

asymmetry in the six-cylinder-port hohlraum when the influences of laser
entrance holes (LEHs) and laser spots cancel each other out with suitable
target parameters. A radiation drive with 300 eV and good flux symmetry can be
achieved with use of laser energy of 2.3 MJ and 500 TW peak power. According to
the simulations, the electron temperature and the electron density on the wall
of laser cone are high and low, respectively, which are similar to those of
outer cones in the hohlraums on National Ignition Facility (NIF). And the laser
intensity is also as low as those of NIF outer cones. So the backscattering due
to laser plasma interaction (LPI) is considered to be negligible. The
six-cyliner-port hohlraum could be superior to the traditional cylindrical
hohlraum and the octahedral hohlraum in both higher symmetry and lower
backscattering without supplementary technology at acceptable laser energy. It
is undoubted that the hohlraum will add to the diversity of ICF approaches.

to one of the non-radial pulsation periods present for years prior to the

the satellite observation intervals did not cover the peaks of the optical

analytical continuation of time to an imaginary time. We extend the concept to
static thermal gradients by recasting the temperature variation as a variation

anti-Quark potential in a system with thermal gradient. A naturally occurring
QCD medium with thermal gradients is a Quark Gluon Plasma (QGP). However, the
QGP evolves in time. Hence, we use a quasi-stationary approximation, which is
applicable only if the rate of time evolution is slow. The application of our
proposal to a Quark anti-Quark potential in QGP can be seen as a step towards a
more exact theory which would incorporate time varying thermal gradients. The
effect of a static temperature gradient on the Quark anti-Quark potential is
analyzed using a gravity dual model. A non-uniform black string metric is
developed, by perturbing the Schwarzchild metric, which allows to incorporate
the temperature gradient in the dual AdS space. Finally, an expression for the
Quark anti-Quark potential, in the presence of a static temperature gradient,
is derived.

dark gas. We identified 36 DMG clouds with C$^+$ emission (data from Galactic
Observations of Terahertz C+ (GOT C+) project) and HINSA features. Based on
uncertainty analysis, optical depth of HI $\tau\rm_{HI}$ of 1 is a reasonable
value for most clouds. With the assumption of $\tau\rm_{HI}=1$, these clouds
were characterized by excitation temperatures in a range of 20 K to 92 K with a
median value of 55 K and volume densities in the range of $6.2\times10^1$

decreases with increasing excitation temperature following an empirical
relation $f\rm_{DMG}=-2.1\times 10^{-3}T_(ex,\tau_{HI}=1)$+1.0. The relation
between $f\rm_{DMG}$ and total hydrogen column density $N_H$ is given by
$f\rm_{DMG}$=$1.0-3.7\times 10^{20}/N_H$. The values of $f\rm_{DMG}$ in the
clouds of low extinction group ($A\rm_V \le 2.7$ mag) are consistent with the
results of the time-dependent, chemical evolutionary model at the age of ~ 10
Myr. Our empirical relation cannot be explained by the chemical evolutionary
model for clouds in the high extinction group ($A\rm_V > 2.7$ mag). Compared to
clouds in the low extinction group ($A\rm_V \le 2.7$ mag), clouds in the high
extinction group ($A\rm_V > 2.7$ mag) have comparable volume densities but

insight into its underlying structure and also potential functions? In this
paper, we introduce a new graph clustering algorithm Dcut from a density point
of view. The basic idea is to envision the graph clustering as a density-cut
problem, such that the vertices in the same cluster are densely connected and
the vertices between clusters are sparsely connected. To identify meaningful
clusters (communities) in a graph, a density-connected tree is first
constructed in a local fashion. Owing to the density-connected tree, Dcut
allows partitioning a graph into multiple densely tight-knit clusters directly.
We demonstrate that our method has several attractive benefits: (a) Dcut
provides an intuitive criterion to evaluate the goodness of a graph clustering
in a more natural and precise way; (b) Built upon the density-connected tree,
Dcut allows identifying the meaningful graph clusters of densely connected
vertices efficiently; (c) The density-connected tree provides a connectivity
map of vertices in a graph from a local density perspective. We systematically
evaluate our new clustering approach on synthetic as well as real data to
demonstrate its good performance.

achieve minimum queueing delay given a power constraint, a probabilistic
cross-layer scheduling policy is proposed, and characterized by a Markov chain

with this issue, we convert the optimization problem into an equivalent Linear

scheduling policy with an optimal threshold imposed on the queue length in

interactions. Many of the resulting phenomena find applications in optical
systems. One example is dispersive wave generation, the optical analog of
Cherenkov radiation. These waves have an essential role in fiber spectral
broadeners that are routinely used in spectrocopy and metrology. Dispersive
waves form when a soliton pulse begins to radiate power as a result of
higher-order dispersion. Recently, dispersive wave generation in microcavities
has been reported by phase matching the waves to dissipative Kerr cavity (DKC)
solitons. Here, it is shown that spatial mode interactions within a microcavity
can also be used to induce dispersive waves. These interactions are normally
avoided altogether in DKC soliton generation. The soliton self frequency shift
is also shown to induce fine tuning control of the dispersive wave frequency.
Both this mechanism and spatial mode interactions provide a new method to
spectrally control these important waves.

moduli spaces of framed local systems $\X_{G',S}$ and $\A_{G,S}$ have the
structure of cluster varieties, and thus together form a cluster ensemble, when
$G$ had type $A$. This was extended to classical groups in \cite{Le}. In this

to construct the cluster structure in this case. We also illustrate our
approach by rederiving the cluster structure for $G$ of type $A$. Our goals are

the low-photon regime. Furthermore the Gaussian benchmark established here can
be used to critically assess the performance of non-Gaussian protocols for

photonics offers a huge range of optical manipulations beyond light transport

use of photonics is the difficulty of achieving photonic action in a multimode

photonic lantern (Leon-Saval, Birks & Bland-Hawthorn 2005) and the delivery of
high-efficiency devices (< 1 dB loss) five years on (Noordegraaf et al 2009).
Multicore fibres (MCF), used in conjunction with lanterns, are now enabling an
even bigger leap towards multimode photonics. Until recently, the single-moded
cores in MCFs were not sufficiently uniform to achieve telecom (SMF-28)
performance. Now that high-quality MCFs have been realized, we turn our
attention to printing complex functions (e.g. Bragg gratings for OH
suppression) into their N cores. Our first work in this direction used a
Mach-Zehnder interferometer (near-field phase mask) but this approach was only
adequate for N=7 MCFs as measured by the grating uniformity (Lindley et al
2014). We have now built a Sagnac interferometer that gives a three-fold
increase in the depth of field sufficient to print across N > 127 cores. We

populations and be characterised by similar chemical features, e.g. O-Na
anti-correlation. While second-population stars, identified by their Na
overabundance, have been found from the main sequence turn-off up to the tip of
the red giant branch in various Galactic GCs, asymptotic giant branch (AGB)
stars have rarely been targeted. The recent finding that NGC 6752 lacks an
Na-rich AGB star has thus triggered new studies on AGB stars in GCs, since this
result questions our basic understanding of GC formation and stellar evolution
theory. In order to compare the Na abundance distributions of AGB and RGB stars
in Galactic GCs and investigate whether the presence of Na-rich stars on the
AGB is metallicity-dependent, we obtained the high-resolution spectra with the
multi-object high-resolution spectrograph FLAMES on ESO/VLT for a sample of AGB
and RGB stars in the Galactic GC NGC 2808. The accurate Na abundances were
derived for 31 AGB and 40 RGB stars. We find that NGC 2808 has a mean
metallicity of -1.11 $\pm$ 0.08 dex, in good agreement with earlier analyses.
Comparable Na abundance dispersions are derived for our AGB and RGB samples,
with the AGB stars being slightly more concentrated than the RGB stars. The
ratios of Na-poor first-population to Na-rich second-population stars are 45:55
in the AGB sample and 48:52 in the RGB sample. NGC 2808 has Na-rich
second-population AGB stars, which turn out to be even more numerous - in
relative terms - than their Na-poor AGB counterparts and the Na-rich stars on
the RGB. Our findings are well reproduced by the fast rotating massive stars
scenario and they do not contradict the recent results that there is not an
Na-rich AGB star in NGC 6752. NGC 2808 thus joins the larger group of Galactic
GCs for which Na-rich second-population stars on the AGB have recently been
found.

present through a latent process. Use of generalized linear model (GLM)
estimating equations leads to asymptotically biased estimates of regression
coefficients for binomial responses. An alternative is to use marginal
likelihood, in which the variance of the latent process but not the serial
dependence is accounted for. In practice this is equivalent to using
generalized linear mixed model estimation procedures treating the observations
as independent with a random effect on the intercept term in the regression
model. We prove this method leads to consistent and asymptotically normal
estimates even if there is an autocorrelated latent process. Simulations
suggest that the use of marginal likelihood can lead to GLM estimates result.
This problem reduces rapidly with increasing number of binomial trials at each
time point but, for binary data, the chance of it can remain over 45% even in
very long time series. We provide a combination of theoretical and heuristic
explanations for this phenomenon in terms of the properties of the regression
component of the model and these can be used to guide application of the method

MCMC, we are for the first time able to evaluate the approximate VB posterior
against the exact MCMC posterior, and show that VB can lead to spurious
activation. In addition, we develop an improved VB method that drops the
assumption of independent voxels a posteriori. This algorithm is shown to be
much faster than both MCMC and the original VB for large datasets, with
negligible error compared to the MCMC posterior.

establishes a connection between two distinct momentum-space topologies - that
of a vortex ring (a circle of singularity) and a monopole-anti-monopole pair

Gaussian process are considered. Score tests are developed to first test for
the existence of a latent process and, subsequent to that, evidence of serial
dependence in that latent process. The test for the existence of a latent
process is important because, if one is present, standard logistic regression
methods will produce inconsistent estimates of the regression parameters.
However the score test is non-standard and any serial dependence in the latent
process will require consideration of nuisance parameters which cannot be
estimated under the null hypothesis of no latent process. The paper describes
how a supremum-type test can be applied. If a latent process is detected,
consistent estimation of its variance and the regression parameters can be done
using marginal estimation which is easily implemented using generalised linear
mixed model methods. The test for serial dependence in a latent process does
not involve nuisance parameters and is based on the covariances between
residuals centered at functions of the latent process conditional on the
observations. This requires numerical integration in order to compute the test
statistic. Relevant asymptotic results are derived and confirmed using
simulation evidence. Application to binary and binomial time series is made.
For binary series in particular, a complication is that the variance of the
latent process, even if present, can be estimated to be zero with a high
probability.

To achieve this goal, we first propose a constrained Tired Random Walk (TRW) by
constructing an $R$-level nearest-neighbor strengthened tree over the graph,
and then compute a TRW matrix for similarity measurement purposes. After this,
the nearest neighbors are identified according to the TRW matrix and the class
label of a query point is determined by the sum of all the TRW weights of its
nearest neighbors. To deal with online situations, we also propose a new
algorithm to handle sequential samples based a local neighborhood
reconstruction. Comparison experiments are conducted on both synthetic data
sets and real-world data sets to demonstrate the validity of the proposed new
$k$NN algorithm and its improvements to other version of $k$NN algorithms.
Given the widespread appearance of manifold structures in real-world problems
and the popularity of the traditional $k$NN algorithm, the proposed manifold
version $k$NN shows promising potential for classifying manifold-distributed

pairing arises from nearest-neighbor (NN) attractive interaction and the
intrinsic spin-orbit coupling. We demonstrate this in two independent
approaches: We study superconducting instability driven by condensation of
Cooperons, which are in-gap bound states of two conduction electrons, within
the $T$-matrix approximation and also study the superconducting ground state
within the mean-field theory. We find that Cooperons with antiparallel spins
condense at the $K$ and $K'$ points. This leads to the emergence of an
intra-valley spin-triplet pairing state belonging to the irreducible
representation A$_1$ of the point group $C_{6v}$. The fact that this pairing
state has opposite chirality for $K$ and $K'$ identifies this state as a
""helical"" valley-triplet state, the valley-analog to the $^3$He-B phase in two
dimension. Because of the finite center of mass momentum of Cooper pairs, the
pair amplitude in NN bonds exhibits spatial modulation on the length scale of
lattice constant, such that this pairing state may be viewed as a pair-density
wave state. We find that the pair amplitude spontaneously breaks the
translational symmetry and exhibits a $p$-Kekul\'e pattern. We also discuss the
selection rule for pairing states focusing the characteristic band structure of
the KM model and the Berry phase effects to the emergence of the intra-valley

with other telescope arrays. Starting at 09:55 UT and throughout 3 hours, the
radio emission was kept within the observational session of UTR-2. The
interesting observation covered the full evolution of this burst, ""from birth

times 11:29 UT and 12:24 UT took place. The time profile of this burst in radio
has a double-humped shape that can be explained by injection of energetic
electrons, accelerated by the two flares, into the burst source. According to
the heliographic observations we suggest the burst source was confined within a
high coronal loop, which was a part of a relatively slow coronal mass ejection.
The latter has been developed for several hours before the onset of the event.

measurements are available. The functional data analysis perspective has been
shown to provide an effective and flexible approach to address this problem for
the case where measurements are sparse but their times are randomly distributed
over an interval. Here we focus on a different scenario where available data
can be characterized as snippets, which are very short stretches of
longitudinal measurements. For each subject the stretch of available data is
much shorter than the time frame of interest, a common occurrence in
accelerated longitudinal studies. An added challenge is introduced if a time
proxy that is basic for usual longitudinal modeling is not available. This
situation arises in the case of Alzheimer's disease and comparable scenarios,
where one is interested in time dynamics of declining performance, but the time
of disease onset is unknown and the chronological age does not provide a
meaningful time reference for longitudinal modeling. Our main methodological
contribution is to address this problem with a novel approach. Key quantities
for our approach are conditional quantile trajectories for monotonic processes
that emerge as solutions of a dynamic system, and for which we obtain uniformly
consistent estimates. These trajectories are shown to be useful to describe
processes that quantify deterioration over time, such as hippocampal volumes in
Alzheimer's patients.

measures supported on $\mathbb{R}^{d}$ is introduced via convex penalization.
The existence and uniqueness of such barycenters is first proved for a large
class of penalization functions. The Bregman divergence associated to the
penalization term is then considered to obtain a stability result on penalized
barycenters. This allows the comparison of data made of $n$ absolutely
continuous probability measures, within the more realistic setting where one
only has access to a dataset of random variables sampled from unknown
distributions. The convergence of the penalized empirical barycenter of a set
of $n$ iid random probability measures towards its population counterpart is
finally analyzed. This approach is shown to be appropriate for the statistical
analysis of either discrete or absolutely continuous random measures. It also
allows to construct, from a set of discrete measures, consistent estimators of
population Wasserstein barycenters that are absolutely continuous.

influence of the turbulent expansion, chemical composition, and magnetic fields
on the stratification in the upper layers of the solar models in comparison
with solar observations. Furthermore, we test alternative <3D> averages for
improved results on the oscillation frequencies. We appended temporally and
spatially averaged <3D> stratifications to 1D models to compute adiabatic
oscillation frequencies that we then tested against observations. We also
developed depth-dependent corrections for the solar 1D model, for which we
expanded the geometrical depth to match the pressure stratification of the
solar <3D> model, and we reduced the density that is caused by the turbulent
pressure. We obtain the same results with our <3D> models as have been reported
previously. Our depth-dependent corrected 1D models match the observations to
almost a similar extent as the <3D> model. We find that correcting for the
expansion of the geometrical depth and the reducing of the density are both
equally necessary. Interestingly, the influence of the adiabatic exponent Gam1
is less pronounced than anticipated. The turbulent elevation directly from the
<3D> model does not match the observations properly. Considering different
reference depth scales for the <3D> averaging leads to very similar
frequencies. Solar models with high metal abundances in their initial chemical
composition match the low-frequency part much better. We find a linear relation

back to a simple geometry in epoch 2013.61. The field is strongly dipolar and
the evolution of the dipole component of the field is reminiscent of the solar

well-established system for analogue gravity. Indeed, while such relativistic
systems cannot be yet realized experimentally, they provide an interesting
framework for mimicking metrics for which no analogue is yet available, so
paving the way for further theoretical and numerical explorations. In this
vein, we here discuss black holes in rBECs and explore how their features
relate to the bulk properties of the system. We then propose the coupling of
external fields to the rBEC as a way to mimic non-metric features. In
particular, we use a Proca field to simulate an aether field, as found in
Einstein-Aether or Horava-Lifshitz gravity. This allows us to mimic a universal
horizon, the causal barrier relevant for superluminal modes in these modified
gravitational theories.

surrounding low- and high- mass protostars, but also in cold dark clouds.
Therefore, it is interesting to understand how such species can be formed
without the presence of embedded energy sources. We present new laboratory
experiments on the low-temperature solid state formation of three complex
molecules: methyl formate (HC(O)OCH3), glycolaldehyde (HC(O)CH2OH) and ethylene
glycol (H2C(OH)CH2OH), through recombination of free radicals formed via H-atom
addition and abstraction reactions at different stages in the CO-H2CO-CH3OH
hydrogenation network at 15 K. The experiments extend previous CO hydrogenation
studies and aim at resembling the physical&chemical conditions typical of the
CO freeze-out stage in dark molecular clouds, when H2CO and CH3OH form by
recombination of accreting CO molecules and H-atoms on ice grains. We confirm
that H2CO, once formed through CO hydrogenation, not only yields CH3OH through
ongoing H-atom addition reactions, but is also subject to H-atom-induced
abstraction reactions, yielding CO again. In a similar way, H2CO is also formed
in abstraction reactions involving CH3OH. The dominant methanol H-atom
abstraction product is expected to be CH2OH, while H-atom additions to H2CO
should at least partially proceed through CH3O intermediate radicals. The
occurrence of H-atom abstraction reactions in ice mantles leads to more
reactive intermediates (HCO, CH3O and CH2OH) than previously thought, when
assuming sequential H-atom addition reactions only. This enhances the
probability to form COMs through radical-radical recombination without the need
of UV photolysis or cosmic rays as external triggers.

magnetization arises with the onset of superconductivity implying that the time
reversal symmetry is preserved in the superconducting state of beta-PdBi2.
Further, a strong diamagnetic shift of the applied field has been observed in
the transverse-field (TF) muSR experiments, indicating that any triplet-pairing
channel, if present, does not dominate the superconducting condensate. Using
TF-muSR, we estimate that the magnetic penetration depth is 263(10) nm at zero

evidence for the existence of a nodeless single s-wave type isotropic energy
gap of 0.78(1) meV at zero temperature. Our results further suggest that the

such conformal structures that admit an almost Einstein scale: First, they are

$SL(3,{\mathbb R})$, or a particular semidirect product $SL(2,{\mathbb

reduction partitions the underlying manifold into several submanifolds and
endows each ith a geometric structure. This establishes novel links between

$\mathit{B}_{y}$ $\neq$ 0, flux transport is asymmetrically distributed between
the two hemispheres. We describe how $\mathit{B}_{y}$ is induced in the closed
magnetosphere on both the dayside and nightside and present the governing
equations. The magnetosphere imposes asymmetric forces on the ionosphere, and
the effects on the ionospheric flow are characterized by distorted convection
cell patterns, often referred to as ""banana"" and ""orange"" cell patterns. The
flux asymmetrically added to the lobes results in a non-uniform induced
$\mathit{B}_{y}$ in the closed magnetosphere. By including the dynamics of the
system, we introduce a mechanism that predicts asymmetric Birkeland currents at
conjugate foot points. Asymmetric Birkeland currents are created as a
consequence of $\textit {y}$ directed tension contained in the return flow.
Associated with these currents, we expect fast localized ionospheric azimuthal
flows present in one hemisphere but not necessarily in the other. We also
present current density measurements from Active Magnetosphere and Planetary
Electrodynamics Response Experiment that are consistent with this picture. We
argue that the induced $\mathit{B}_{y}$ produces asymmetrical Birkeland
currents as a consequence of asymmetric stress balance between the hemispheres.
Such an asymmetry will also lead to asymmetrical foot points and asymmetries in
the azimuthal flow in the ionosphere. These phenomena should therefore be
treated in a unified way.

used to perform rapid binary decisions in a classifier. In order to study the
robustness of the previous results, the present research examines the effects
of modifying some of the components of the original model. For improved
biological realism, we replace the original non-leaky integrate-and-fire
neurons with Izhikevich-like neurons. We also replace the original STDP rule
with a novel rule that has a probabilistic interpretation. The probabilistic
STDP slightly but significantly improves the performance for both types of
model neurons. Use of the Izhikevich-like neuron was not found to improve
performance although performance was still comparable to the IF neuron. This
shows that the model is robust enough to handle more biologically realistic
neurons. We also conclude that the underlying reasons for stable performance in
the model are preserved despite the overt changes to the explicit components of

illuminate how a planet's atmosphere responds to changes in incident flux. We
report here the analysis of multi-day multi-channel photometry of the eccentric

planet's extreme eccentricity combined with the long coverage and exquisite
precision of new periastron-passage observations allow us to break the
degeneracy between the radiative and dynamical timescales of HD 80606 b's
atmosphere and constrain its global thermal response. Our analysis reveals that
the atmospheric layers probed heat rapidly (~4 hr radiative timescale) from
$\lt$500 to 1400 K as they absorb ~ 20% of the incoming stellar flux during the
periastron passage, while the planet's rotation period is 93$\pm_{35}^{85}$ hr,
which exceeds the predicted pseudo-synchronous period (40 hr).

a cleaner and more streamlined system. Our formalization is more expressive

pathological cases of the current implementation resulting in a more intuitive

full-fledged union types to functional languages of the ML family that usually
rely on the Hindley-Milner type system. As an aside, our system also improves
the theory of semantic subtyping, notably by proving completeness for the type
reconstruction algorithm.

C-Medoids (ECMdd), which belongs to the family of medoid-based clustering for

theoretical framework of belief functions. In the application of FCMdd and
original ECMdd, a single medoid (prototype), which is supposed to belong to the
object set, is utilized to represent one class. For the sake of clarity, this
kind of ECMdd using a single medoid is denoted by sECMdd. In real clustering
applications, using only one pattern to capture or interpret a class may not
adequately model different types of group structure and hence limits the
clustering performance. In order to address this problem, a variation of ECMdd
using multiple weighted medoids, denoted by wECMdd, is presented. Unlike
sECMdd, in wECMdd objects in each cluster carry various weights describing
their degree of representativeness for that class. This mechanism enables each
class to be represented by more than one object. Experimental results in
synthetic and real data sets clearly demonstrate the superiority of sECMdd and
wECMdd. Moreover, the clustering results by wECMdd can provide richer
information for the inner structure of the detected classes with the help of
prototype weights.

the quan-tification step where the Conditional Probability Tables (CPTs) are
determined. The number of parameters included in CPTs increases exponentially
with the number of parent variables. The most common solution is the
application of the so-called canonical gates. The Noisy-OR (NOR) gate, which
takes advantage of the independence of causal interactions, provides a
logarithmic reduction of the number of parameters required to specify a CPT. In
this paper, an extension of NOR model based on the theory of belief functions,
named Belief Noisy-OR (BNOR), is proposed. BNOR is capable of dealing with both
aleatory and epistemic uncertainty of the network. Compared with NOR, more rich
information which is of great value for making decisions can be got when the
available knowledge is uncertain. Specially, when there is no epistemic
uncertainty, BNOR degrades into NOR. Additionally, different structures of BNOR
are presented in this paper in order to meet various needs of engineers. The
application of BNOR model on the reliability evaluation problem of networked

factors at \PANDA (FAIR) within the PandaRoot software framework are reported.
The statistical precision with which the proton form factors can be determined
is estimated. The signal channel $\bar p p \to e^+ e^-$ is studied on the basis
of two different but consistent procedures. The suppression of the main
background channel, $\textit{i.e.}$ $\bar p p \to \pi^+ \pi^-$, is studied.
Furthermore, the background versus signal efficiency, statistical and
systematical uncertainties on the extracted proton form factors are evaluated
using two different procedures. The results are consistent with those of a
previous simulation study using an older, simplified framework. However, a
slightly better precision is achieved in the PandaRoot study in a large range
of momentum transfer, assuming the nominal beam conditions and detector
performance.

consider the mechatronic component as the lowest level in the system
composition hierarchy that tightly integrates mechanics with the electronics
and software required to convert the mechanics to intelligent (smart) object
offering well defined services to its environment. For this mechatronic
component to be integrated in the IoT-based industrial automation environment,
a software layer is required on top of it to convert its conventional interface
to an IoT compliant one. This layer, that we call IoTwrapper, transforms the
conventional mechatronic component to an Industrial Automation Thing (IAT). The
IAT is the key element of an IoT model specifically developed in the context of
this work for the manufacturing domain. The model is compared to existing IoT
models and its main differences are discussed. A model-to-model transformer is
presented to automatically transform the legacy mechatronic component to an IAT
ready to be integrated in the IoT-based industrial automation environment. The
UML4IoT profile is used in the form of a Domain Specific Modeling Language to
automate this transformation. A prototype implementation of an Industrial

with Kerr nonlinear material are proposed to achieve efficient four-wave mixing
(FWM). Highly localized plasmon resonances are formed in the nanogap between
the metallic film and nanostripes. The local electric field is dramatically
enhanced in this subwavelength nanoregion. These properties combined with the
relaxed phase matching condition due to the ultrathin area lead to a giant FWM
efficiency, which is enhanced by nineteen orders of magnitude compared to a
bare silver screen. In addition, efficient visible and low-THz sources can be
constructed based on the proposed nonlinear metasurfaces. The FWM generated
coherent wave has a directional radiation pattern and its output power is
relatively insensitive to the incident angles of the excitation sources. This
radiated power can be further enhanced by increasing the excitation power. The
dielectric nonlinear material placed in the nanogap is mainly responsible for
the ultrastrong FWM response. Compact and efficient wave mixers and optical

a joint-photon-number-modulo-2 measurement of the propagating modes for the
two-qubit measurement and homodyne detections as the final single-qubit

the success-rate of generating high fidelity Bell-states. This motivates us to
propose a second continuous variable implementation, where we use quantum error
correction to suppress the decoherence due to photon loss to first order. To
that end, we encode the ancilla qubits in superpositions of Schr\""odinger cat

with a hard to soft state transition. We observed the field with XMM-Newton on
February 26th for 35 ks, detecting the source in the soft state, characterised
by a low level of variability and a soft X-ray thermal spectrum with a high
energy tail (detected by INTEGRAL up to ~50 keV), typical of either accreting
neutron stars or black holes. We observed: i) a high column density of neutral
absorbing material, suggesting that Swift J174540.7-290015 is located near or
beyond the GC and; ii) a sub-Solar Iron abundance, therefore we argue that Iron
is depleted into dust grains. The lack of detection of FeK absorption lines,
eclipses or dipping suggests that the accretion disc is observed at a low
inclination angle. Radio (VLA) observations did not detect any radio
counterpart to Swift J174540.7-290015. No evidence for X-ray or radio
periodicity is found. The location of the transient was observed also in the

with Very Large Telescope narrowband Halpha observations of the nearby spiral
galaxy NGC 300, we explore a method for estimating the escape fractions of
hydrogen-ionizing photons from HII regions within this galaxy. Our goal in this
concept study is to evaluate the spectral types of the most massive stars using
the broadband data and estimating their ionizing photon output with the help of
stellar atmosphere models. A comparison with the Halpha flux that gives the
amount of ionized gas in the HII region provides a measure of the escape
fraction of ionizing photons from that region. We performed some tests with a
number of synthetic young clusters with varying parameters to assess the
reliability of the method. However, we found that the derived stellar spectral
types and consequently the expected ionizing photon luminosity of a region is
highly uncertain. The tests also show that on one hand we tended to
overestimate the integrated photon output of a region for young ages and low
numbers of stars, and on the other hand we mostly underestimated the combined
ionizing luminosity for a large stellar number and older cluster ages. We
conclude that the proposed method of using stellar broadband photometry to
infer the leakage of ionizing photons from HII regions is highly uncertain and
dominated by the errors of the resulting stellar spectral types. Therefore this
method is not suitable. Stellar spectra are needed to reliably determine the
stellar types and escape fractions. Studies to this end have been carried out
for the Magellanic Clouds.

ionizing SED and of the gas distribution, in terms of ionization parameter U
and chemical abundances (e.g. O/H and N/O). A strong degeneracy exists between
the hardness of the SED and U, which in turn leads to high uncertainties in the
determination of the other parameters, including abundances. One way to resolve
the degeneracy is to fix one of the parameters using additional information.
  For each of the ~ 20000 sources of the CALIFA HII regions catalog, a grid of
photoionization models is computed assuming the ionizing SED being described by
the underlying stellar population obtained from spectral synthesis modeling.
The ionizing SED is then defined as the sum of various stellar bursts of
different ages and metallicities. This solves the degeneracy between the shape
of the ionizing SED and U. The nebular metallicity (associated to O/H) is
defined using the classical strong line method O3N2 (which gives to our models
the status of ""hybrids""). The remaining free parameters are the abundance ratio
N/O and the ionization parameter U, which are determined by looking for the
model fitting [NII]/Ha and [OIII]/Hb. The models are also selected to fit
[OII]/Hb. This process leads to a set of ~ 3200 models that reproduce
simultaneously the three observations.
  We find that the regions associated to young stellar bursts suffer leaking of
the ionizing photons, the proportion of escaping photons having a median of
80\%. The set of photoionization models satisfactorily reproduces the electron
temperature derived from the [OIII]4363/5007 line ratio. We determine new
relations between the ionization parameter U and the [OII]/[OIII] or
[SII]/[SIII] line ratios. New relations between N/O and O/H and between U and
O/H are also determined.

particle filters, they improve the precision of finite-difference estimators of

The minimality condition of the 7 - vertex tetrablock as a building unit is the
consequence of its unique mapping by the Klein's quartic (which is
characterized by the minimal hyperbolic Schwartz triangle) into the minimal
finite projective geometry. The topological stability of this helix provided by
the pitch to radius ratio H/R of 2{\pi}/({\tau}+1) ({\tau} is the golden
section) and by the local rotation axis order of 40/11=40exp(-H/R). These
parameters determine the helix of C{\alpha} atoms inside the alpha - helix with
the accuracy of up to 2%. They explain also the bonding relationship i -- i+4
between the i-th amide group and the (i+4)-th carbonil group of the residues in
the peptide chain and the observed value of the average segment length of the
alpha-helix which is equal to 11 residues. The tetra-block helix with the N,

momentum per SN deposited in the interstellar medium (ISM) by affecting the
local ISM density, which in turn affects the cooling rate. We study the effect
of multiple SNe using idealized 1D hydrodynamic simulations which explore a
large parameter space of the number of SNe, and the background gas density and
metallicity. The results are provided as a table and an analytic fitting
formula. We find that for clusters with up to ~100 SNe the asymptotic momentum
scales super-linearly with the number of SNe, resulting in a momentum per SN
that can be an order of magnitude larger than for a single SN, with a maximum
efficiency for clusters with 10-100 SNe. We argue that additional physical
processes not included in our simulations -- self-gravity, breakout from a
galactic disk, and galactic shear -- can slightly reduce the momentum
enhancement from clustering, but the average momentum per SN still remains a
factor of 4 larger than the isolated SN value when averaged over a realistic
cluster mass function for a star-forming galaxy. We conclude with a discussion
of the possible role of mixing between hot and cold gas, induced by
multi-dimensional instabilities or preexisting density variations, as a
limiting factor in the buildup of momentum by clustered SNe, and suggest future

When the primary system comprises several polynomial nonlinearities, we

continued until the desired resolution is achieved. We investigate different

H2O + LinA3B2O12 = LiOH + HnA3B2O12. Most of the compositions are stable

the reaction of lithium hydroxide with CO2 to make lithium carbonate. The
calculated hydration resistance scales with the Pauling bond valence on the
oxygen atom contributed by the coordinating A and B ions. In the unexchanged
Li-garnets, this bond valence must be balanced by lithium, so there is also a
good overall correlation of hydration stability with lithium stoichiometry (n):
hydration resistance increases in the order Li8-garnet < Li7-garnet <
Li6-garnet < Li5-garnet < Li3-garnet. Only Li3A3B2O12 garnets have proton
exchange energies sufficiently positive to overcome the decomposition energy of
