predicting the probability of next words among a vocabulary of size D (e.g.
200,000). Computing the equally large, but typically non-sparse D-dimensional
output vector from a last hidden layer of reasonable dimension d (e.g. 500)
incurs a prohibitive O(Dd) computational cost for each example, as does
updating the $D \times d$ output weight matrix and computing the gradient
needed for backpropagation to previous layers. While efficient handling of
large sparse network inputs is trivial, the case of large sparse targets is
not, and has thus so far been sidestepped with approximate alternatives such as
hierarchical softmax or sampling-based approximations during training. In this
work we develop an original algorithmic approach which, for a family of loss
functions that includes squared error and spherical softmax, can compute the
exact loss, gradient update for the output weights, and gradient for
backpropagation, all in $O(d^{2})$ per example instead of $O(Dd)$, remarkably
without ever computing the D-dimensional output. The proposed algorithm yields
a speedup of up to $D/4d$ i.e. two orders of magnitude for typical sizes, for

disc locations for which there are no neighboring active regions. We also
compare the mode parameters in active regions with those in comparably located
quiet regions. Our analysis is based on ring diagram analysis of all active
regions observed by HMI during almost five years. We find that the frequency at
which the mode amplitude changes from attenuation to amplification in the quiet
nearby regions is around 4.2 mHz, in contrast to the active regions, for which
it is about 5.1 mHz. This amplitude enhancement (the `acoustic halo effect') is
as large as that observed in the active regions, and has a very weak dependence
on the wave propagation direction. The mode energy difference in nearby regions
also changes from a deficit to an excess at around 4.2 mHz, but averages to
zero over all modes. The frequency difference in nearby regions increases with
increasing frequency until a point at which the frequency shifts turn over
sharply as in active regions. However, this turnover occurs around 4.9 mHz,
significantly below the acoustic cutoff frequency. Inverting the horizontal
flow parameters in the direction of the neighboring active regions, we find
flows that are consistent with a model of the thermal energy flow being blocked

assume that the problem is posed in Euclidean space. When solving optimality
problems on function spaces, the functional derivative is then inaccurately
represented with respect to $\ell^2$ instead of the inner product induced by
the function space. This error manifests as a mesh dependence in the number of
iterations required to solve the optimisation problem. In this paper, an
analytic estimate is derived for this iteration count in the case of a simple
and generic discretised optimisation problem. The system analysed is the
steepest descent method applied to a finite element problem. The estimate is
based on Kantorovich's inequality and on an upper bound for the condition
number of Galerkin mass matrices. Computer simulations validate the iteration
number estimate. Similar numerical results are found for a more complex
optimisation problem constrained by a partial differential equation.
Representing the functional derivative with respect to the inner product
induced by the continuous control space leads to mesh independent convergence.

rescaling operation on such spaces. The coarse graining is based on the concept
of quasi-isometry, which yields a sequence of discrete coarse grained spaces
each having a continuum limit under the rescaling operation. We provide
criteria under which such sequences do converge within a superspace of metric
spaces, or may constitute the basin of attraction of a common continuum limit,
which hopefully, may represent our space-time continuum.
  We discuss some of the properties of these coarse grained spaces as well as
their continuum limits, such as scale invariance and metric similarity, and
show that different layers of spacetime can carry different distance functions
while being homeomorphic.
  Important tools in this analysis are the Gromov-Hausdorff distance functional
for general metric spaces and the growth degree of graphs or networks. The
whole construction is in the spirit of the Wilsonian renormalization group.
  Furthermore we introduce a physically relevant notion of dimension on the
spaces of interest in our analysis, which e.g. for regular lattices reduces to
the ordinary lattice dimension. We show that this dimension is stable under the
proposed coarse graining procedure as long as the latter is sufficiently local,
i.e. quasi-isometric, and discuss the conditions under which this dimension is
an integer. We comment on the possibility that the limit space may turn out to
be fractal in case the dimension is non-integer. At the end of the paper we
briefly mention the possibility that our network carries a translocal far-order
which leads to the concept of wormhole spaces and a scale dependent dimension
if the coarse graining procedure is no longer local.

a common goal, it results in a collaboration, as can be seen in many walks of
life such as scientific research, motion picture production, or team sports.
The artifacts resulting from a collaboration (e.g. papers, movies) are best
captured using a hypergraph model, whereas the relation of who has collaborated
with whom is best captured via an abstract simplicial complex (SC). In this
paper, we propose a generative algorithm GeneSCs for SCs modeling fundamental
collaboration relations, primarily based on preferential attachment. The
proposed network growth process favors attachment that is preferential not to
an individual's degree, i.e., how many people has he/she collaborated with, but
to his/her facet degree, i.e., how many maximal groups or facets has he/she
collaborated within. Unlike graphs, in SCs, both facet degrees (of nodes) and
facet sizes are important to capture connectivity properties. Based on our
observation that several real-world facet size distributions have significant
deviation from power law-mainly due to the fact that larger facets tend to
subsume smaller ones-we adopt a data-driven approach. We seed GeneSCs with a
facet size distribution informed by collaboration network data and randomly
grow the SC facet-by-facet to generate a final SC whose facet degree
distribution matches real data. We prove that the facet degree distribution
yielded by GeneSCs is power law distributed for large SCs and show that it is
in agreement with real world co-authorship data. Finally, based on our
intuition of collaboration formation in domains such as collaborative
scientific experiments and movie production, we propose two variants of GeneSCs
based on clamped and hybrid preferential attachment schemes, and show that they
perform well in these domains.

at the Coulomb branch) and how it interacts with the boundaries of the x^10. We
find that the massless twisted states are not localized in the x^10. Instead,
they are non-local meson-like composite particles comprised of a quark living

The goal of the algorithm is to convert a square matrix into a balanced matrix
where every row and corresponding column have the same norm. The original
algorithm was proposed for balancing rows and columns in the $L_2$ norm, and it
works by iterating over balancing a row-column pair in fixed round-robin order.
Variants of the algorithm for other norms have been heavily studied and are
implemented as standard preconditioners in many numerical linear algebra
packages. Recently, Schulman and Sinclair (2015), in a first result of its kind
for any norm, analyzed the rate of convergence of a variant of Osborne's
algorithm that uses the $L_{\infty}$ norm and a different order of choosing
row-column pairs. In this paper we study matrix balancing in the $L_1$ norm and
other $L_p$ norms. We show the following results for any matrix $A =
(a_{ij})_{i,j=1}^n$, resolving in particular a main open problem mentioned by
Schulman and Sinclair.
  1) We analyze the iteration for the $L_1$ norm under a greedy order of
balancing. We show that it converges to an $\epsilon$-balanced matrix in $K =
O(\min\{\epsilon^{-2}\log w,\epsilon^{-1}n^{3/2}\log(w/\epsilon)\})$ iterations
that cost a total of $O(m + Kn\log n)$ arithmetic operations over $O(n\log
w)$-bit numbers. Here $m$ is the number of non-zero entries of $A$, and $w =
\sum_{i,j} |a_{ij}|/a_{\min}$ with $a_{\min} = \min\{|a_{ij}|:\ a_{ij}\neq
0\}$.
  2) We show that the original round-robin implementation converges to an
$\epsilon$-balanced matrix in $O(\epsilon^{-2}n^2\log w)$ iterations totalling
$O(\epsilon^{-2}mn\log w)$ arithmetic operations over $O(n\log w)$-bit numbers.
  3) We demonstrate a lower bound of $\Omega(1/\sqrt{\epsilon})$ on the
convergence rate of any implementation of the iteration.

decompose this graph spectral transformation into the multiresolution low-pass

Set is NP-complete on chordal graphs, it can be solved in time
$n^{\mathcal{O}(t)}$ on $(K_t\boxminus S_t)$-free chordal graphs. The third
statement strengthens a result of Belmonte and Vatshelle stating that either
those classes do not have constant mim-width or a decomposition with constant
mim-width cannot be computed in polynomial time unless $P=NP$. We generalize
these ideas to bigger graph classes. We introduce a new width parameter
sim-width, of stronger modelling power than mim-width, by making a small change
in the definition of mim-width. We prove that chordal graphs and
co-comparability graphs have sim-width at most 1. We investigate a way to bound
mim-width for graphs of bounded sim-width by excluding $K_t\boxminus K_t$ and
$K_t\boxminus S_t$ as induced minors or induced subgraphs, and give algorithmic

either in situ or ex situ assembly, the latter with migration, and are evolved
to the estimated age of the system, 8 Gyr. Models combine detailed calculations
of both the gaseous envelope and the condensed core structures, including
accretion of gas and solids, of the disk's viscous and thermal evolution,
including photo-evaporation and disk-planet interactions, and of the planets'
evaporative mass loss after disk dispersal. Planet-planet interactions are
neglected. Both sets of simulations successfully reproduce measured radii,
masses, and orbital distances of the planets, except for the radius of Kepler
11b, which loses its entire gaseous envelope shortly after formation. Gaseous
(H+He) envelopes account for < 18% of the planet masses, and between 35 and 60%
of the planet radii. In situ models predict a very massive inner disk, whose
solids' surface density (sigma_Z) varies from over 1e4 to 1e3 g/cm2 at
stellocentric distances 0.1 < r < 0.5 AU. Initial gas densities would be in
excess of 1e5 g/cm2 if solids formed locally. Given the high disk temperatures
(> 1000 K), planetary interiors can only be composed of metals and highly
refractory materials. Sequestration of hydrogen by the core and subsequent
outgassing is required to account for the observed radius of Kepler 11b. Ex
situ models predict a relatively low-mass disk, whose initial sigma_Z varies
from 10 to 5 g/cm2 at 0.5 < r < 7 AU and whose initial gas density ranges from
1e3 to 100 g/cm2. All planetary interiors are expected to be rich in H2O, as
core assembly mostly occurs exterior to the ice condensation front. Kepler 11b
is expected to have a steam atmosphere, and H2O is likely mixed with H+He in
the envelopes of the other planets. Results indicate that Kepler 11g may not be
more massive than Kepler 11e.

bio-medical domains ranging from developing effective medicines for tumors and
for viral diseases to developing attenuated virus strains that can be used for

using a mathematical model called the ribosome flow model (RFM). In the RFM,
the mRNA molecule is modeled as a chain of $n$ sites. The flow of ribosomes
between consecutive sites is regulated by $n+1$ transition rates. Given a set
of feasible transition rates, that models the outcome of all possible
mutations, we consider the problem of maximally down regulating the translation
rate by altering the rates within this set of feasible rates. Under certain
conditions on the feasible set, we show that an optimal solution can be
determined efficiently. We also rigorously analyze two special cases of the
down regulation optimization problem. Our results suggest that one must focus
on the position along the mRNA molecule where the transition rate has the
strongest effect on the protein production rate. However, this rate is not
necessarily the slowest transition rate along the mRNA molecule. We discuss
some of the biological implications of these results.

walk can always be described in Lindblad formalism, this does not mean that it

Born-Markov approximation. This restricts the class of quantum stochastic walks
that can be experimentally realized in a simple manner. To circumvent this

We apply this technique to a broad class of quantum stochastic walks, and show

monthly volumes in a network of 55 large California reservoirs, over a period
of 136 months from 2004 to 2015, and we develop a latent-variable graphical
model of their joint fluctuations. We achieve reliable and tractable modeling
of the system because the model structure allows unique recovery of the
best-in-class model via convex optimization with control of the number of free

to be highly correlated with both the Palmer Drought Severity Index (PDSI,
$\rho \approx 0.86$) and hydroelectric production ($\rho \approx 0.71$).
Further, the model allows us to determine system health measures such as
exhaustion probability and per-reservoir drought sensitivity. We find that as

the origin of this mysterious force that drives the behavior of even the
stupidest naturally intelligent systems and is completely absent in their
smartest artificial analogs? Can we build AI systems that could be curious
about something, systems that would have an intrinsic motivation to learn? Is
such a motivation quantifiable? Is it implementable? I will discuss this
problem from the standpoint of physics. The relationship between physics and
intelligence is a consequence of the fact that correctly predicted information
is nothing but an energy resource, and the process of thinking can be viewed as
a process of accumulating and spending this resource through the acts of
perception and, respectively, decision making. The natural motivation of any
autonomous system to keep this accumulation/spending balance as high as
possible allows one to treat the problem of describing the dynamics of thinking
processes as a resource optimization problem. Here I will propose and discuss a
simple theoretical model of such an autonomous system which I call the
Autonomous Turing Machine (ATM). The potential attractiveness of ATM lies in
the fact that it is the model of a self-propelled AI for which the only
available energy resource is the information itself. For ATM, the problem of
optimal thinking, learning, and decision-making becomes conceptually simple and
mathematically well tractable. This circumstance makes the ATM an ideal
playground for studying the dynamics of intelligent behavior and allows one to
quantify many seemingly unquantifiable features of genuine intelligence.

  Solving complex problems can involve non-trivial combinations of distinct
knowledge bases and problem solvers. The Algebra of Modular Systems is a
knowledge representation framework that provides a method for formally
specifying such systems in purely semantic terms. Formally, an expression of
the algebra defines a class of structures. Many expressive formalism used in
practice solve the model expansion task, where a structure is given on the
input and an expansion of this structure in the defined class of structures is
searched (this practice overcomes the common undecidability problem for
expressive logics). In this paper, we construct a solver for the model
expansion task for a complex modular systems from an expression in the algebra
and black-box propagators or solvers for the primitive modules. To this end, we
define a general notion of propagators equipped with an explanation mechanism,
an extension of the alge- bra to propagators, and a lazy conflict-driven
learning algorithm. The result is a framework for seamlessly combining solving
technology from different domains to produce a solver for a combined system.

G5.89-0.39B (an ultra-compact HII region). We identified 159 individual X-ray
point sources in our observation using the source detection algorithm
\texttt{wavdetect}. 35 X-ray sources are associated with the HII complex
G5.89-0.39. The 35 X-ray sources represent an average unabsorbed luminosity
(0.3-10\,keV) of $\sim10^{30.5}$\,erg/s, typical of B7-B5 type stars. The
potential ionising source of G5.89-0.39B known as Feldt's star is possibly
identified in our observation with an unabsorbed X-ray luminosity suggestive of
a B7-B5 star. The stacked energy spectra of these sources is well-fitted with a
single thermal plasma APEC model with kT$\sim$5\,keV, and column density
N$_{\rm H}=2.6\times10^{22}$\,cm$^{-2}$ (A$_{\rm V}\sim 10$). The residual
(source-subtracted) X-ray emission towards G5.89-0.39A and B is about 30\% and
25\% larger than their respective stacked source luminosities. Assuming this
residual emission is from unresolved stellar sources, the total
B-type-equivalent stellar content in G5.89-0.39A and B would be 75 stars,
consistent with an earlier estimate of the total stellar mass of hot stars in
G5.89-0.39. We have also looked at the variability of the 35 X-ray sources in
G5.89-0.39. Ten of these sources are flagged as being variable. Further studies
are needed to determine the exact causes of the variability, however the
variability could point towards pre-main sequence stars. Such a stellar
population could provide sufficient kinetic energy to account for a part of the
GeV to TeV gamma-ray emission in the source HESSJ1800-240B.

Gaussian elimination may turn some zeroes into nonzero values. To maintain the
matrix sparse, we would like to minimize the number $k$ of these changes, hence
called the minimum fill-in problem. Agrawal et al.~[FOCS'90] developed the
first approximation algorithm, based on early heuristics by George [SIAM J
Numer Anal 10] and by Lipton et al.~[SIAM J Numer Anal 16]. The objective
function they used is $m+k$, the number of nonzero elements after elimination.
An approximation algorithm using $k$ as the objective function was presented by
Natanzon et al.~[STOC'98]. These two versions are incomparable in terms of
approximation.
  Parameterized algorithms for the problem was first studied by Kaplan et
al.~[FOCS'94]. Fomin & Villanger [SODA'12] recently gave an algorithm running
in time $2^{O(\sqrt{k} \log k)}+n^{O(1)}$.
  Hardness results of this problem are surprisingly scarce, and the few known
ones are either weak or have to use nonstandard complexity conjectures. The
only inapproximability result by Wu et al.~[IJCAI'15] applies to only the
objective function $m+k$, and is grounded on the Small Set Expansion
Conjecture. The only nontrivial parameterized lower bounds, by Bliznets et
al.~[SODA'16], include a very weak one based on ETH, and a strong one based on
hardness of subexponential-time approximation of the minimum bisection problem
on regular graphs. For both versions of the problem, we exclude the existence
of PTASs, assuming P$\ne$NP, and the existence of $2^{O(n^{1-\delta})}$-time
approximation schemes for any positive $\delta$, assuming ETH. It also implies
a $2^{O(k^{1/2-\delta})} n^{O(1)}$ parameterized lower bound. Behind these
results is a new reduction from vertex cover, which might be of its own
interest: All previous reductions for similar problems are from some kind of
graph layout problems.

simulation of a boundary layer in the range $Re_\theta=2800-6600$, with
emphasis on the behaviour of the relatively large-scale fractal intermittent
region. This requires the introduction of a new definition of the distance
between a point and a general surface, which is compared with the more usual
vertical distance to the top of the layer. Interfaces are obtained by
thresholding the enstrophy field and the magnitude of the rate-of-strain
tensor, and it is concluded that, while the former are physically relevant
features, the latter are not. By varying the threshold, a topological
transition is identified as the interface moves from the free stream into the
turbulent core. A vorticity scale is defined that collapses that transition for
different Reynolds numbers, roughly equivalent to the root-mean-squared
vorticity at the edge of the boundary layer. Conditionally averaged flow
variables are analysed as functions of the new distance, both within and
outside the interface. It is found that the interface contains a nonequilibrium
layer whose thickness scales well with the Taylor microscale, enveloping a
self-similar layer spanning a fixed fraction of the boundary-layer thickness.
Interestingly, the straining structure of the flow is similar in both regions.
Irrotational pockets within the turbulent core are also studied. They form a
self-similar set whose size decreases with increasing depth, presumably due to
break-up by the turbulence, but the rate of viscous diffusion is independent of
the pocket size. The raw data used in the analysis are freely available from
our web page (http://torroja.dmt.upm.es).

CuO$_2$ planes ($n$(IP)=4) sandwiched by two outer planes (OPs) are responsible
for the onset of AFM order, whereas the nearly optimally-doped OPs responsible
for the onset of bulk SC. It is pointed out that an increase in the

the AFM moments for the IPs does not bring about any reduction in $T_c$, since
$T_c\sim 100$ K is maintained for both compounds with nearly optimally doped

the long-range in-plane SC correlation even in the multilayered structure,
which is insensitive to the magnitude of $T_{\rm N}$ and the AFM moments at the

patterns of parallelism - such as flat or two-level parallelism - and a degree
of parallelism that can be statically determined based on the size of the input
dataset. However, the effective use of GPUs for algorithms exhibiting complex
patterns of parallelism, possibly known only at runtime, is still an open
problem. Recently, Nvidia has introduced Dynamic Parallelism (DP) in its GPUs.
By making it possible to launch kernels directly from GPU threads, this feature
enables nested parallelism at runtime. However, the effective use of DP must
still be understood: a naive use of this feature may suffer from significant
runtime overhead and lead to GPU underutilization, resulting in poor
performance. In this work, we target this problem. First, we demonstrate how a
naive use of DP can result in poor performance. Second, we propose three
workload consolidation schemes to improve performance and hardware utilization
of DP-based codes, and we implement these code transformations in a
directive-based compiler. Finally, we evaluate our framework on two categories
of applications: algorithms including irregular loops and algorithms exhibiting
parallel recursion. Our experiments show that our approach significantly
reduces runtime overhead and improves GPU utilization, leading to speedup
factors from 90x to 3300x over basic DP-based solutions and speedups from 2x to
6x over flat implementations.

brings valuable data resources to understand users' moving behaviors. Apart
from recording the trajectory data, another major characteristic of these
location-based services is that they also allow the users to connect whomever
they like. A combination of social networking and location-based services is
called as location-based social networks (LBSN). As shown in previous works,
locations that are frequently visited by socially-related persons tend to be
correlated, which indicates the close association between social connections
and trajectory behaviors of users in LBSNs. In order to better analyze and mine
LBSN data, we present a novel neural network model which can joint model both
social networks and mobile trajectories. In specific, our model consists of two
components: the construction of social networks and the generation of mobile
trajectories. We first adopt a network embedding method for the construction of
social networks: a networking representation can be derived for a user. The key
of our model lies in the component of generating mobile trajectories. We have
considered four factors that influence the generation process of mobile
trajectories, namely user visit preference, influence of friends, short-term
sequential contexts and long-term sequential contexts. To characterize the last
two contexts, we employ the RNN and GRU models to capture the sequential
relatedness in mobile trajectories at different levels, i.e., short term or
long term. Finally, the two components are tied by sharing the user network
representations. Experimental results on two important applications demonstrate
the effectiveness of our model. Especially, the improvement over baselines is
more significant when either network structure or trajectory data is sparse.

amplitude of the propagating magnetic field, the system undergoes a dynamical
phase transition from a driven spin wave propagating phase to a pinned or spin
frozen state as the system is cooled down. The time averaged magnetisation over
a full cycle of the propagating magnetic field plays the role of the dynamic
order parameter. A comprehensive phase diagram is plotted in the plane formed
by the amplitude of the propagating wave and the temperature of the system. It
is found that the phase boundary shrinks inward as the anisotropy increases.

for addressing the problem of dynamic placement (or pinning) of parallelized
applications to processing units. Under the proposed setup each thread of the
parallelized application constitutes an independent decision maker (or agent),
which (based on its own prior performance measurements and its own prior
CPU-affinities) decides on which processing unit to run next. Decisions are
updated recursively for each thread by a resource manager/scheduler which runs
in parallel to the application's threads and periodically records their
performances and assigns to them new CPU affinities. For updating the
CPU-affinities, the scheduler uses a distributed reinforcement-learning
algorithm, each branch of which is responsible for assigning a new placement
strategy to each thread. According to this algorithm, prior allocations are
going to be reinforced in the future proportionally to their prior performance.
The proposed resource allocation framework is flexible enough to address
alternative optimization criteria, such as maximum average processing speed and
minimum speed variance among threads. We demonstrate analytically that
convergence to locally-optimal placements is achieved asymptotically. Finally,
we validate these results through experiments in Linux platforms.

humans search for information. The theory suggests that, following an
information scent, the information seeker must optimize the tradeoff between
exploration by repeated steps in the search space vs. exploitation, using the
resources encountered. We conjecture that this tradeoff characterizes how a
user deals with uncertainty and its two aspects, risk and ambiguity in economic
theory. Risk is related to the perceived quality of the actually visited patch
of information, and can be reduced by exploiting and understanding the patch to
a better extent. Ambiguity, on the other hand, is the opportunity cost of
having higher quality patches elsewhere in the search space. The aforementioned
tradeoff depends on many attributes, including traits of the user: at the two
extreme ends of the spectrum, analytic and wholistic searchers employ entirely
different strategies. The former type focuses on exploitation first,
interspersed with bouts of exploration, whereas the latter type prefers to
explore the search space first and consume later. Based on an eye-tracking
study of experts' interactions with novel search interfaces in the biomedical
domain, we demonstrate that perceived risk shifts the balance between
exploration and exploitation in either type of users, tilting it against vs. in
favour of ambiguity minimization. Since the pattern of behaviour in information
foraging is quintessentially sequential, risk and ambiguity minimization cannot
happen simultaneously, leading to a fundamental limit on how good such a
tradeoff can be. This in turn connects information seeking with the emergent
field of quantum decision theory.

analog-valued artificial neural networks (ANNs). Such training techniques,
however, do not transfer easily to spiking networks due to the spike generation
hard non-linearity and the discrete nature of spike communication. We show that
in a feedforward spiking network that uses a temporal coding scheme where
information is encoded in spike times instead of spike rates, the network
input-output relation is differentiable almost everywhere. Moreover, this
relation is piece-wise linear after a transformation of variables. Methods for
training ANNs thus carry directly to the training of such spiking networks as
we show when training on the permutation invariant MNIST task. In contrast to
rate-based spiking networks that are often used to approximate the behavior of
ANNs, the networks we present spike much more sparsely and their behavior can
not be directly approximated by conventional ANNs. Our results highlight a new
approach for controlling the behavior of spiking networks with realistic
temporal dynamics, opening up the potential for using these networks to process
spike patterns with complex temporal information.

laser pulses is theoretically addressed. The laser driven temporal evolution of
the energy distribution of electrons in the conduction band is described by a
kinetic Boltzmann equation. In addition to the collisional processes for energy
transfer such as electron-phonon-photon and electron-electron interactions, a
non-collisional process for photon absorption in the conduction band is
included. It relies on direct transitions between sub-bands of the conduction
band through multiphoton absorption. This mechanism is shown to significantly
contribute to the laser heating of conduction electrons for large enough laser
intensities. It also increases the time required for the electron distribution
to reach the equilibrium state as described by the Fermi-Dirac statistics.
Quantitative results are provided for quartz irradiated by a femtosecond laser
pulse with a wavelength of 800 nm and for intensities in the range of tens of
TW/cm$^2$, lower than the ablation threshold. The change in the energy
deposition induced by this non-collisional heating process is expected to have
a significant influence on the laser processing of dielectric materials.

tighter than previous experiments, and severely constrains SUSY GUT and other

already discovered more than 170 VHE gamma-ray emitters providing plentiful of
valuable data and clearly demonstrating the power of this technique. In spite

coverage is advisable to observe far-away extragalactic objects and improve
spectral analysis. CTA aims to increase the sensitivity by an order of
magnitude compared to current facilities, to extend the accessible gamma-ray
energies from a few tens of GeV to a hundred of TeV, and to improve on other
parameters like angular and energy resolution. CTA will provide moreover a full
sky-coverage by featuring an array of imaging atmospheric Cherenkov telescopes
in both hemispheres. This paper presents an overview of the technical design

$R_{\rm AA}$. The latter is presented as a function of the centrality of the
collision and, for central collisions, as a function of the transverse momentum
$p_{\rm T}$ of the J/$\psi$. The measured $R_{\rm AA}$ values indicate a
suppression of the J/$\psi$ in nuclear collisions and are then compared to our
previous results obtained in Pb-Pb collisions at $\sqrt{s_{\rm NN}}=2.76$ TeV.
The ratio of the $R_{\rm AA}$ values at the two energies is also computed and
compared to calculations of statistical and dynamical models. The numerical
value of the ratio for central events (0-10\% centrality) is $1.17 \pm 0.04

coupling on the spin-transistor operation. Starting from the model, in which
the SO coupling constants are treated as parameters, we show that the
inter-subband SO interaction strongly affects the ordinary conductance
oscillations predicted for the transistor with the single occupancy.
Interestingly, we find that even in the absence of the intra-subband SO
interaction, the conductance oscillates as a function of the inter-subband SO
coupling constant. This phenomenon is explained as resulting from the
inter-subband transition with spin-flip. Next, we consider the realistic spin
transistor model based on the gated
Al$_{0.48}$In$_{0.52}$As/Ga$_{0.47}$In$_{0.53}$As double quantum well, for
which the SO coupling constants are determined by the Schr\""{o}dinger-Poisson
approach. We show that the SO coupling constants rapidly change around $V_g=0$,
which is desirable for the spin transistor operation. We demonstrate that for
high electron densities the inter-subband SO interaction starts to play the
dominant role. The strong evidence of this interaction is the reduction of the
conductance for gate voltage $V_g=0$, which leads to the reduction of the
on/off conductance ratio.

follows a McKean-Vlasov dynamics and the diffusion coefficient can be
degenerate. We prove that its value function V admits a nonlinear Feynman-Kac
representation in terms of a class of forward-backward stochastic differential
equations, with an autonomous forward process. We exploit this probabilistic
representation to rigorously prove the dynamic programming principle (DPP) for
V. The Feynman-Kac representation we obtain has an important role beyond its
intermediary role in obtaining our main result: in fact it would be useful in
developing probabilistic numerical schemes for V. The DPP is important in
obtaining a characterization of the value function as a solution of a
non-linear partial differential equation (the so-called Hamilton-Jacobi-Belman
equation), in this case on the Wasserstein space of measures. We should note
that the usual way of solving these equations is through the Pontryagin maximum
principle, which requires some convexity assumptions. There were attempts in
using the dynamic programming approach before, but these works assumed a priori
that the controls were of Markovian feedback type, which helps write the
problem only in terms of the distribution of the state process (and the control
problem becomes a deterministic problem). In this paper, we will consider
open-loop controls and derive the dynamic programming principle in this most
general case. In order to obtain the Feynman-Kac representation and the
randomized dynamic programming principle, we implement the so-called
randomization method, which consists in formulating a new McKean-Vlasov control
problem, expressed in weak form taking the supremum over a family of equivalent
probability measures. One of the main results of the paper is the proof that
this latter control problem has the same value function V of the original

Nambu-Goldstone bosons of a spontaneously broken symmetry or because of finite
fermionic density effects. After expanding the generally covariant equations in
inverse powers of the conductivity, the relativistic analog of the magnetic
diffusivity equation is derived in the presence of vortical and magnetic
currents. While the anomalous contributions are generally suppressed by the
diffusivity, they are shown to disappear in the perfectly conducting limit.
When the flow is irrotational, boost-invariant and with vanishing
four-acceleration the corresponding evolution equations are explicitly
integrated so that the various physical regimes can be directly verified.

phenomenon, termed assortative mixing or sometimes homophily, can be quantified
through assortativity coefficient in social networks. Uncovering the exact
causes of strong assortative mixing found in social networks has been a
research challenge. Among the main suggested causes from sociology are the
tendency of similar individuals to connect (often itself referred as homophily)
and the social influence among already connected individuals. An important
question to researchers and in practice can be tackled, as we present here:
understanding the exact mechanisms of interplay between these tendencies and
the underlying social network structure. Namely, in addition to the mentioned
assortativity coefficient, there are several other static and temporal network
properties and substructures that can be linked to the tendencies of homophily
and social influence in the social network and we herein investigate those.
Concretely, we tackle a computer-mediated \textit{communication network} (based
on Twitter mentions) and a particular type of assortative mixing that can be
inferred from the semantic features of communication content that we term
\textit{semantic homophily}. Our work, to the best of our knowledge, is the
first to offer an in-depth analysis on semantic homophily in a communication
network and the interplay between them. We quantify diverse levels of semantic
homophily, identify the semantic aspects that are the drivers of observed
homophily, show insights in its temporal evolution and finally, we present its
intricate interplay with the communication network on Twitter. By analyzing
these mechanisms we increase understanding on what are the semantic aspects
that shape and how they shape the human computer-mediated communication.

12, 584 (2016)). The nonlinear mechanical response of collagen networks was
shown to be quantitatively described within the framework of such mechanical
critical phenomenon. Here, we provide a more quantitative characterization of
critical behavior in subisostatic networks. Using finite size scaling we
demonstrate the divergence of strain fluctuations in the network at
well-defined critical strain. We show that the characteristic strain
corresponding to the onset of strain stiffening is distinct from but related to
this critical strain in a way that depends on critical exponents. We confirm
this prediction experimentally for collagen networks. Moreover, we find that
the apparent critical exponents are largely independent of the spatial
dimensionality. In a highly simplified computational model of network dynamics,
we also observe critical slowing down in the vicinity of the critical strain.
With subisostaticity as the only required condition, strain-driven criticality
is expected to be a general feature of biologically relevant fibrous networks.

surprisingly large opacity fluctuations over rather large ($\ge$50 comoving
Mpc/h) spatial scales. We model these fluctuations using a hybrid approach
utilizing the large volume Millennium simulation to predict the spatial
distribution of QSOs combined with smaller scale full hydrodynamical simulation
performed with RAMSES and post-processed with the radiative transfer code ATON.
We produce realictic mock absorption spectra that account for the contribution
of galaxies and QSOs to the ionising UV background. This improved models
confirm our earlier findings that a significant ($\ge$50%) contribution of
ionising photons from QSOs can explain the large reported opacity fluctuations
on large scales. The inferred QSO luminosity function is thereby consistent
with recent estimates of the space density of QSOs at this redshift. Our
simulations still somewhat struggle, however, to reproduce the very long (110
comoving Mpc/h) high opacity absorption through observed in ULAS J0148+0600,
perhaps suggesting an even later end of reionization than assumed in our
previously favoured model. Medium-deep/medium area QSO surveys as well as
targeted searches for the predicted strong transverse QSO proximity effect
whould illuminate the origin of the observed large scale opacity fluctuations.
They would allow to substantiate whether UV fluctuations due to QSO are indeed
primarily responsible, or whether significant contributions from other recently
proposed mechansims such as large scale fluctuations in temperature and mean
free path (even in the absence of rare bright sources) are required.

the rise of information gain above and beyond that which the units already
achieve individually, being therefore related to consciousness studies in some

separation effect in the slab is shown to depend on both temperature and
chemical potential; this is distinct from the unrealistic case of the magnetic
field filling the unbounded (infinite) medium, when the effect is temperature
independent. In the realistic case of the slab, a stepwise behaviour of the
axial current density at zero temperature is smoothed out as temperature
increases, turning into a linear behaviour at infinitely large temperature. A
choice of boundary conditions can facilitate either augmentation or attenuation
of the chiral separation effect; in particular, the effect can persist even at
zero chemical potential, if temperature is finite. Thus the boundary condition
can serve as a source that is additional to the spinor matter density.

topological model where strong links have a fixed normalized capacity 1, and
where weak links have reduced normalized capacity $\tau<1$, we identify --- as
a function of the cache size and $\tau$ --- the optimal throughput performance,
within a factor of at most 8. The transmission scheme that achieves this
performance, employs a simple form of interference enhancement, and exploits
the property that weak links attenuate interference, thus allowing for
multicasting rates to remain high even when involving weak users. This approach
ameliorates the negative effects of uneven topology in multicasting, now
allowing all users to achieve the optimal performance associated to $\tau=1$,
even if $\tau$ is approximately as low as $\tau\geq 1-(1-w)^g$ where $g$ is the
coded-caching gain, and where $w$ is the fraction of users that are weak. This
leads to the interesting conclusion that for coded multicasting, the weak users
need not bring down the performance of all users, but on the contrary to a
certain extent, the strong users can lift the performance of the weak users
without any penalties on their own performance. Furthermore for smaller ranges
of $\tau$, we also see that achieving the near-optimal performance comes with
the advantage that the strong users do not suffer any additional delays
compared to the case where $\tau = 1$.

quark-lepton Higgs coupling, we derive conditions for extracting upper limits
on the lepton-nucleon Higgs coupling from light atoms and ions, assuming the
availability of locally precise two- and three-body methods might be
beneficial. A recent work has proposed to extract these limits in heavy atoms
where the Higgs term is enhanced by $\approx 10^3 AZ$, due to both the large
coupling modifier and large $A$, $Z$, and assuming sufficiently precise
relativistic electron wave functions. We first revisit the old idea of using
the Lamb shift in light muonic ions where the coupling is enhanced by about
$201^3 AZ^3$ primarily due to the concentration of the muon wave function at
the origin, the muon coupling modifier already being close to 1. For the muonic
helium an experimental precision below 0.1 ppm is required to reach the
constraints on Higgs couplings. However, theoretical uncertainty is large due
to nuclear potential dependence of the finite size terms enhanced by the small
muon orbit, and their elimination by using several states is precluded due to
the Lamb shift being the only precisely measurable state. In normal
(electronic) light systems transitions between low-lying states lie near the
optical region allowing precise experiments, and extraction may be possible by
eliminating the finite-size, polarization and Zemach moment terms from a set of
transitions, e.g. $1S-2S$ and improved $2^3S-2^3P$ and $2^1S-2^3S$ in ${\rm

near a Hopf bifurcation instability; spontaneous structure formation in

driven-dissipative Bose--Einstein condensation, realized in open systems on the

broken, and the dynamics is characterized by the stationary static and dynamic

renormalization group flow equations as well as construct a suitable complex
spherical model extension to argue that this conclusion likely remains true to

analyse and quantify the amount of flux cancellation that occurs in NOAA AR
11226 and its two neighbouring ARs (11227 & 11233) using line-of-sight
magnetograms from the Heliospheric Magnetic Imager. During a 3.6-day period
building up to the filament eruption, 1.7 x 10^21 Mx, 21% of AR 11226's maximum
magnetic flux, was cancelled along the polarity inversion line (PIL) where the
filament formed. If the flux cancellation continued at the same rate up until
the eruption then up to 2.8 x 10^21 Mx (34% of the AR flux) may have been built
into the magnetic configuration that contains the filament plasma. The large
flux cancellation rate is due to an unusual motion of the positive polarity
sunspot, which splits, with the largest section moving rapidly towards the PIL.
This motion compresses the negative polarity and leads to the formation of an
orphan penumbra where one end of the filament is rooted. Dense plasma threads
above the orphan penumbra build into the filament, extending its length, and
presumably injecting material into it. We conclude that the exceptionally
strong flux cancellation in AR 11226 played a significant role in the formation
of its unusually massive filament. In addition, the presence and coherent
evolution of bald patches in the vector magnetic field along the PIL suggests
that the magnetic field configuration supporting the filament material is that
of a flux rope.

steering is the temporal analogue of Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen (EPR) steering in
the quantum domain, enabling control of the state of a remote system, and can
hence be connected to the security of secret key generation between two remote
parties. We derive the steering criterion for a single mode coherent state when
displaced parity measurements are performed at two different times. The
security bound of the Bennett-Brassard 1984 (BB84) protocol under the gaussian

However, these algorithms assume a linearly-sortable integer alphabet. A recent
breakthrough paper by Bannai et.\ al.\ (SODA 2015) showed a link between the
two notions: all the runs in a string can be computed via a linear number of
LCE queries. The first to consider these problems over a general ordered
alphabet was Kosolobov (\emph{Inf.\ Process.\ Lett.}, 2016), who presented an
$O(n (\log n)^{2/3})$-time algorithm for answering $O(n)$ LCE queries. This
result was improved by Gawrychowski et.\ al.\ (accepted to CPM 2016) to $O(n

of LCE queries asked in the runs computation. We show that any $n$ such
non-crossing queries can be answered on-line in $O(n \alpha(n))$ time, which
yields an $O(n \alpha(n))$-time algorithm for computing runs.

number of tightly-coupled distributed applications will be implemented on top

collaborative robotic teams, work in a coordinated fashion, whereby a
distinguished node takes control decisions and sends commands to other nodes,
which in turn perform the requested action/operation and send back a

that the proposed protocol can achieve significantly better performance

that our out-of-sample extension algorithm renders a more robust and accurate

allow pinpointing star formation in galaxies independently of redshift, dust

the star-formation history over cosmic time. About half of the optical
afterglows of long-duration GRBs are missed due to dust extinction, and are
primarily located in the most massive GRB hosts. In order to understand this
bias it is important to investigate the amount of obscured star-formation in
these GRB host galaxies. Radio emission of galaxies correlates with
star-formation, but does not suffer extinction as do the optical star-formation
estimators. We selected 11 GRB host galaxies with either large stellar mass or
large UV-/optical-based star-formation rates (SFRs) and obtained radio
observations of these with the Australia Telescope Compact Array and the Karl
Jansky Very Large Array. Despite intentionally selecting GRB hosts with
expected high SFRs, we do not find any star-formation-related radio emission in
any of our targets. Our upper limit for GRB 100621A implies that the earlier
reported radio detection was due to afterglow emission. We do detect radio
emission from the position of GRB 020819B, but argue that it is in large parts,
if not all, due to afterglow contamination. Half of our sample has
radio-derived SFR limits which are only a factor 2--3 above the optically
measured SFRs. This supports other recent studies that the majority of star
formation in GRB hosts is not obscured by dust.

experimental analysis that are motivated by the mean-field approximation. We
find major discrepancies in a wide parameter regime between the thus extracted

crucial quantitative importance of spatio-temporal correlations in binary

We say that $Y$ {\it tracks} $X$ if $[Y,X]=fX$ for some continuous function
$f\colon M\rightarrow\mathbb F$. Let $K$ be a compact subset of the zero set
${\mathsf Z}(X)$ such that ${\mathsf
  Z}(X)-K$ is closed, with nonzero Poincar\'e-Hopf index (for example
$K={\mathsf Z}(X)$ when $M$ is compact and $\chi(M)\neq 0$) and let $\mathcal
G$ be a finite-dimensional Lie algebra of analytic vector fields on $M$.
\smallskip
  {\bf Theorem.} Let $X$ be analytic and nontrivial. If every element of
$\mathcal G$ tracks $X$ and, in the complex case when ${\mathsf i}_K (X)$ is
positive and even no quotient of $\mathcal G$ is isomorphic to ${\mathfrak
{s}}{\mathfrak {l}} (2,\mathbb C)$, then $\mathcal G$ has some zero in $K$.
\smallskip
  {\bf Corollary.} If $Y$ tracks a nontrivial vector field $X$, both of them
analytic, then $Y$ vanishes somewhere in $K$. \smallskip
  Besides fixed point theorems for certain types of transformation groups are
proved. Several illustrative examples are given.

syllogisms and in his famous square of opposition. Of course, the logical
formulas in Aristotle work were not modern formulas of mathematical logic, but
ordinary sentences of natural language. Nowadays natural language sentences are
turned into formulas of predicate logic as defined by Frege, but, it is not
clear that those Fregean sentences are faithful representations of natural
language sentences. Indeed, the usual modelling of natural language quantifiers
does not fully correspond to natural language syntax, as we shall see. This is
the reason why Hilbert's epsilon and tau quantifiers (that go beyond usual
quantifiers) have been used to model natural language quantifiers. Here we
interpret Aristotle quantified sentences as formulas of Hilbert's epsilon and
tau calculus. This yields to two potential squares of opposition and provided a
natural condition holds, one of these two squares is actually a square of
opposition i.e. satisfies the relations of contrary, contradictory, and
subalternation.

higher-order Markov chain models with memory to capture patterns in multi-step
pathways. Higher-order models are particularly important for effectively
revealing actual, overlapping community structure, but higher-order Markov
chain models suffer from the curse of dimensionality: their vast parameter
spaces require exponentially increasing data to avoid overfitting and therefore
make mapping inefficient already for moderate-sized systems. To overcome this
problem, we introduce an efficient cross-validated mapping approach based on
network flows modeled by sparse Markov chains. To illustrate our approach, we
present a map of citation flows in science with research fields that overlap in
multidisciplinary journals. Compared with currently used categories in science
of science studies, the research fields form better units of analysis because
the map more effectively captures how ideas flow through science.

hadronic molecules that form the coupled-channel system of

  $\bar{D}^{(\ast)}\Sigma^{(\ast)}_{\rm c}$. As the heavy quark spin symmetry
manifests the mass degenerations of $\bar{D}$ and $\bar{D}^\ast$ mesons, and of
$\Sigma_{\rm c}$ and $\Sigma^\ast_{\rm c}$ baryons, the coupled channels of
$\bar{D}^{(\ast)}\Sigma^{(\ast)}_{\rm c}$ are important in these molecules. In
addition, we consider the coupling to the $\bar{D}^{(\ast)}\Lambda_{\rm c}$
channel whose thresholds are near the $\bar{D}^{(\ast)}\Sigma^{(\ast)}_{\rm c}$
thresholds, and the coupling to the state with nonzero orbital angular momentum
mixed by the tensor force. This full coupled channel analysis of
$\bar{D}^{(\ast)}\Lambda_{\rm c}-\bar{D}^{(\ast)}\Sigma^{(\ast)}_{\rm c}$ with
larger orbital angular momentum has never been performed before. By solving the
coupled-channel Schr\""odinger equations with the one meson exchange potentials

the admixture of minority helicity components in the transverse spin angular

Selection Model (USM) for language change (Baxter et al., Phys. Rev. E {\bf
73}, 046118, 2006). This is motivated by the fact that the Fokker-Planck
continuous time limit derived in the original version of the USM is only valid
for a small range of parameters. We investigate the consequences of relaxing
these constraints on parameters. Using the normal approximation of the
multinomial approximation, we derive a new continuous time limit of the USM in
the form of a weak-noise stochastic differential equation. We argue that this
weak noise, not captured by the Kramers-Moyal expansion, can not be neglected.
We then propose a coarse-graining procedure, which takes the form of a
stochastic version of the \emph{heterogeneous mean field} approximation. This
approximation groups the behaviour of nodes of same degree, reducing the
complexity of the problem. With the help of this approximation, we study in
detail two simple families of networks: the regular networks and the
star-shaped networks. The analysis reveals and quantifies a finite size effect
of the dynamics. If we increase the size of the network by keeping all the
other parameters constant, we transition from a state where conventions emerge
to a state when no convention emerges. Furthermore, we show that the degree of
a node acts as a time scale. For heterogeneous networks such as star-shaped
networks, the time scale difference can become very large leading to a noisier
behaviour of highly connected nodes.

Specifically, we generalize the recently proposed Alternating Anderson-Jacobi
(AAJ) method (Pratapa et al., J. Comput. Phys. (2016), 306, 43--54) to include
preconditioning, discuss efficient parallel implementation, and provide serial
MATLAB and parallel C/C++ implementations. In serial applications to
nonsymmetric systems, we find that AAR is comparably robust to GMRES, using the
same preconditioning, while often outperforming it in time to solution; and
find AAR to be more robust than Bi-CGSTAB for the problems considered. In
parallel applications to the Helmholtz and Poisson equations, we find that AAR
shows superior strong and weak scaling to GMRES, Bi-CGSTAB, and Conjugate
Gradient (CG) methods, using the same preconditioning, with consistently
shorter times to solution at larger processor counts. Finally, in massively
parallel applications to the Poisson equation, on up to 110,592 processors, we
find that AAR shows superior strong and weak scaling to CG, with shorter
minimum time to solution. We thus find that AAR offers a robust and efficient
alternative to current state-of-the-art solvers, with increasing advantages as
the number of processors grows.

cyber-physical systems to address global needs in areas such as energy, water,
healthcare, and transportation. However, as recent events have shown, such
systems are vulnerable to cyber attacks. Being safety critical, their
disruption or misbehavior can cause economic losses or injuries and loss of
life. It is therefore important to secure such networked cyber-physical systems
against attacks. In the absence of credible security guarantees, there will be
resistance to the proliferation of cyber-physical systems, which are much
needed to meet global needs in critical infrastructures and services.
  This paper addresses the problem of secure control of networked
cyber-physical systems. This problem is different from the problem of securing
the communication network, since cyber-physical systems at their very essence
need sensors and actuators that interface with the physical plant, and
malicious agents may tamper with sensors or actuators, as recent attacks have
shown.
  We consider physical plants that are being controlled by multiple actuators
and sensors communicating over a network, where some sensors could be
""malicious,"" meaning that they may not report the measurements that they
observe. We address a general technique by which the actuators can detect the
actions of malicious sensors in the system, and disable closed-loop control
based on their information. This technique, called ""watermarking,"" employs the
technique of actuators injecting private excitation into the system which will
reveal malicious tampering with signals. We show how such an active defense can
be used to secure networked systems of sensors and actuators.

photonic band structure can have a bandgap in the bulk while supporting
topologically protected unidirectional edge modes. Recent studies [1-6] on
bianisotropic metamaterials that emulate the electronic quantum spin Hall
effect using its electromagnetic analog are examples of such systems with
relatively simple and elegant design. In this paper, we present a rotating
magnetic dipole antenna, composed of two perpendicularly oriented coils, that
can efficiently excite the unidirectional topologically protected surface waves
in the bianisotropic metawaveguide (BMW) structure recently realized by Ma, et
al. [1], despite the fact that the BMW medium does not break time-reversal
invariance. In addition to achieving high directivity, the antenna can be tuned
continuously to excite reflectionless edge modes to the two opposite directions
with various amplitude ratios. We demonstrate its performance through
experiment and compare to simulation results.

in the $^3S_1 (I=1)$ channel. We study if the existence of this two-body bound
state could give rise to stable three-body systems. For this purpose we solve
the bound state problem of three-body systems where the $\Xi N$ state is merged
with $N$'s, $\Lambda$'s, $\Sigma's$ or $\Xi$'s, making use of the most recent
updates of the two-body ESC08c Nijmegen potentials. We found that there appear

barycenter, where a transformation is considered which takes an arbitrary point
of division $\xi \in (0,1)$ of the segments of a polygon with $n$ vertices. We
then consider connecting these new points to form another polygon, and iterate
this process. After considering properties of our generalized transformation
matrix, a surprisingly elegant interplay of elementary complex analysis and
linear algebra is used to find a closed form for our iterative process. We then
specify the new limiting ellipse, $\mathcal{E}$, which has oscillating
semi-axes. Along the way we find that the case for $\xi = 1/2$ enjoys some
special optimality conditions, and periodicity of the ellipse $\mathcal{E}$ is
analyzed as well. To conclude, an even more generalized case is considered:
taking a different point of division for every segment of our polygon
$\mathcal{P} (\vec{x}^{(0)}, \vec{y}^{(0)})$.

writing the Friedmann equation in order to facilitate an intuitive
understanding of the possible solutions; for students and researchers alike. As
has been noted in passing by others, this specific form of the Friedmann
equation allows us to view the universal expansion as a particle rolling along
a frictionless track. Specific examples depicted include the current
concordance cosmological model as well as a stable static universal model.
