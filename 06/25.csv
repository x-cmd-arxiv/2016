Quark Effective Theory (HQET) we determine the $b$-quark fragmentation function
from electron-positron annihilation data at the $Z$-boson peak at
next-to-next-to leading order, with next-to-next-to leading log resummation of
DGLAP logarithms, and next-to-next-to-next-to leading log resummation of
endpoint logarithms. This analysis improves, by one order, the previous
extraction of the $b$-quark fragmentation function. We find that while the
addition of the next order in the calculation does not much shift the extracted
form of the fragmentation function, it does reduce theoretical errors
indicating that the expansion is converging. Using an approach based on
effective field theory allows us to systematically control theoretical errors.
While the fits of theory to data are generally good, the fits seem to be
hinting that higher order correction from HQET may be needed to explain the
$b$-quark fragmentation function at smaller values of momentum fraction.

nonlinear Schr\""odinger equation on $\R^2$. This is the first symplectic
non-squeezing result for a Hamiltonian PDE in infinite volume. As the
underlying symplectic Hilbert space is $L^2(\R^2)$, this requires working with
initial data in this space. This space also happens to be scaling-critical for
this equation. Thus, we also obtain the first unconditional symplectic
non-squeezing result in such a critical setting.
  More generally, we show that solutions of this PDE can be approximated by a
finite-dimensional Hamiltonian system, despite the wealth of non-compact
symmetries: scaling, translation, and Galilei boosts. This approximation result
holds uniformly on bounded sets of initial data. Complementing this
approximation result, we show that all solutions of the finite-dimensional
Hamiltonian system can be approximated by the full PDE.
  A key ingredient in these proofs is the development of a general methodology
for obtaining uniform global space-time bounds for suitable Fourier truncations
of dispersive PDE models.

polarity where the magnetic field is relatively strong and slightly inclined,
while outside such very localized patches the linear polarization is often
dominated by the contribution of atomic level polarization. We demonstrate that
a correct modeling of this last contribution requires taking into account the

significant non-thermal X-rays are seen toward the southwestern part of the
shell where the HI gas traces the dense and cold component. We also identified
CO clouds which are likely interacting with the SNR shock waves in the same
velocity range as the HI, although the CO clouds are distributed only in a
limited part of the SNR shell. The most massive cloud is located in the
southeastern part of the shell, showing detailed correspondence with the
thermal X-rays. These CO clouds show an enhanced CO $J$ = 2-1/1-0 intensity
ratio, suggesting heating/compression by the shock front. We interpret that the
shock-cloud interaction enhances non-thermal X-rays in the southwest and the
thermal X-rays are emitted by the shock-heated gas of density 10-100 cm$^{-3}$.
Moreover, we can clearly see an HI envelope around the CO cloud, suggesting
that the progenitor had a weaker wind than the massive progenitor of the
core-collapse SNR RX J1713.7$-$3949. It seems likely that the progenitor of RCW
86 was a system consisting of a white dwarf and a low-mass star with

scale at which excitations become nearly delocalized. Within the forward
scattering approximation in the bosonic hopping we find the effective mobility
edge $\epsilon_c$ to oscillate periodically with the magnetic flux per
plaquette, $\phi$. We find non-analytic cusps in $\epsilon_c(\phi)$ at integer

of the mobility edge (and thus of resistance) with applied flux, in contrast to
the equivalent fermionic problem. The amplitude of the oscillations is much
more substantial in bosons than in fermions. Bosons exhibit a single hump per
flux period, while fermion characteristics undergo two humps. Those are
identical for non-interacting fermions, but Coulomb correlations are shown to
lead to systematic deviations from this statistical period doubling. Our theory

order of few thousands bytes which represents a very attractive feature
compared to Hamming metric-based encryption schemes where public key sizes are
of order of hundreds of thousands bytes even with additional structures like
the cyclicity. The main tool for building public key encryption schemes in rank
metric is the McEliece encryption setting used with the family of Gabidulin
codes. Since the original scheme proposed in 1991 by Gabidulin, Paramonov and
Tretjakov, many systems have been proposed based on different masking
techniques for Gabidulin codes. Nevertheless, over the years all these systems
were attacked essentially by the use of an attack proposed by Overbeck.
  In 2005 Faure and Loidreau designed a rank-metric encryption scheme which was
not in the McEliece setting. The scheme is very efficient, with small public
keys of size a few kiloBytes and with security closely related to the
linearized polynomial reconstruction problem which corresponds to the decoding
problem of Gabidulin codes. The structure of the scheme differs considerably
from the classical McEliece setting and until our work, the scheme had never
been attacked. We show in this article that this scheme like other schemes
based on Gabidulin codes, is also vulnerable to a polynomial-time attack that
recovers the private key by applying Overbeck's attack on an appropriate public
code. As an example we break concrete proposed $80$ bits security parameters in

conjecture that this holds without the quasi-homogeneous assumption. We also
deduce that the aforementioned quotient is nonzero when c is a root of the
b-function of f (which Saito recently showed fails to hold in the inhomogeneous
case). We obtain these results by comparing these D-modules to those defined by
Etingof and the second author which represent invariants under Hamiltonian
flow.

confinement intensity. We argued that the subdiffusion regimes appear as
consequence of the restricted space available for diffusion (achieved either
through large confinement and/or large noise); we saw that when there are large
confinement and noise intensity, a similar configuration to single file
diffusion appears; on the other hand, normal and superdiffusive regimes may
occur due to low noise (longer persistent motion), either through exploring a
wider region around the potential minimum in the transverse direction (low
confinement), or by forming independent clusters (high confinement).

the prediction of the epidemic risk when these data are fed to numerical models
of epidemic spread: low participation rate, under-reporting of contacts and
overestimation of contact durations in contact diaries with respect to sensor

possibility to construct, using only the contact diary network information, a
surrogate contact network such that simulations using this surrogate network
give the same estimation of the epidemic risk as simulations using the contact

  The main original contribution of this thesis is to develop the properties of
a particular kind of cluster variety called the symplectic double. We show that
the symplectic double is birational to a certain moduli space of local systems
associated to a doubled surface. We define a version of the notion of measured
lamination on such a surface and prove that the space of all such laminations
is a tropicalization of the symplectic double. We describe a canonical map from
this space of laminations into the algebra of rational functions on the
symplectic double.

Goncharov's duality conjectures for quantum cluster varieties associated to a
disk with finitely many marked points on its boundary. These duality
conjectures identify a canonical set of elements in the quantized algebra of

time-frequency analysis and, of course, in quantum mechanics. Roughly speaking
the basic idea, due to Dirac, is to associate to any symbol, or observable,
$a(x,\xi)$ an operator $\mathrm{Op}(a)$, according to some axioms dictated by
physical considerations. This led to the introduction of a variety of
quantizations. They all agree when the symbol $a(x,\xi)=f(x)$ depends only on
$x$ or $a(x,\xi)=g(\xi)$ depends only on $\xi$: \[
\mathrm{Op}(f\otimes1)u=fu,\quad\mathrm{Op}(1\otimes g)u=\mathcal{F}%
^{-1}(g\mathcal{F}u) \] where $\mathcal{F}$ stands for the Fourier transform.
Now, Dirac aimed at finding a quantization satisfying, in addition, the key
correspondence \[
\lbrack\mathrm{Op}(a),\operatorname*{Op}(b)]=i\mathrm{Op}(\{a,b\}) \] where
$[\,,\,]$ stands for the commutator and $\{\,,\}$ for the Poisson brackets,
which would represent a tight link between classical and quantum mechanics.
Unfortunately, the famous Groenewold-van Hove theorem states that such a
quantization does not exist, and indeed most quantization rules satisfy this
property only approximately.
  Now, in this note we show that the above commutator rule in fact holds for
the Born-Jordan quantization, at least for symbols of the type $f(x)+g(\xi)$.
Moreover we will prove that, remarkably, this property completely characterizes
this quantization rule, making it the quantization which best fits the Dirac
dream.

slow ""starvation"" mode to a rapid ""stripping"" mode at low masses. We
investigate the plausibility of this scenario using observed HI surface density
profiles for a sample of 66 nearby galaxies as inputs to analytic calculations
of ram-pressure and viscous stripping. Across a broad range of host properties,
we find that stripping becomes increasingly effective at $M_{*} < 10^{8-9}\

canonical values of the circumgalactic medium density ($n_{\rm halo} <

infalling satellites are, on average, stripped of < 40 - 70% of their cold gas
reservoir, which is insufficient to match observations. By including a host
halo gas distribution that is clumpy and therefore contains regions of higher
density, we are able to reproduce the observed HI gas fractions (and thus the
high quenched fraction and short quenching timescale) of Local Group
satellites, suggesting that a host halo with clumpy gas may be crucial for
quenching low-mass systems in Local Group-like (and more massive) host halos.

secondary star on the recurrence timescale of hours to days. X-ray lightcurves
are now available for large numbers of ULXs as a result of the latest
XMM-Newton catalogue. We determine the amount of fractional variability that
should be injected into an otherwise featureless lightcurve for a given set of
system parameters as a result of eclipses and compare this to the available
data. We find that the vast majority of sources for which the variability has
been measured to be non-zero and for which available observations meet the
criteria for eclipse searches, have fractional variabilities which are too low
to derive from eclipses and so must be viewed such that theta =< acos(R*/a).

give rise to a series of local minima in the post-inflationary region of the

a dynamical phase decomposition, analogously to what happens in the course of
thermal first-order phase transitions. In the subsequent process of bubble wall
collisions, the lowest-lying axionic minimum eventually takes over all space.

proposals that their semiclassical description is modified not just near the

beyond the horizon, they influence regions accessible to distant observeration.
Natural candidates for these modifications behave like metric fluctuations,
with characteristic length and time scales set by the horizon radius. We
investigate the possibility of using the Event Horizon Telescope to observe
these effects, if they have a strength sufficient to make quantum evolution
consistent with unitarity. We find that such quantum fluctuations can introduce
a strong time dependence for the shape and size of the shadow that a black hole
casts on its surrounding emission. For the black hole in the center of the
Milky Way, detecting the rapid time variability of its shadow will require
non-imaging timing techniques. However, for the much larger black hole in the
center of the M87 galaxy, a variable black-hole shadow, if present with these
parameters, would be readily observable in the individual snapshots that will
be obtained by the Event Horizon Telescope.

comoving cumulative number density in observational studies. Many theoretical
works, however, have shown that the number densities of tracked galaxy
populations evolve in bulk and spread out over time. We present a number
density method for linking progenitor and descendant galaxy populations which
takes both of these effects into account. We define probability distribution
functions that capture the evolution and dispersion of galaxy populations in
comoving number density space, and use these functions to assign galaxies at
one redshift $z_f$ probabilities of being progenitors or descendants of a
galaxy population at another redshift $z_0$. These probabilities are then used
as weights for calculating distributions of physical properties such as stellar
mass, star formation rate, or velocity dispersion within the
progenitor/descendant population. We demonstrate that this probabilistic method
provides more accurate predictions for the evolution of physical properties
then either the assumption of a constant number density or the assumption of an
evolving number density in a bin of fixed width by comparing the predictions
against galaxy populations directly tracked through a cosmological simulation.
We find that the constant number density method performs most poorly at
recovering galaxy properties, the evolving number method density slightly
better, and the probabilistic number density method best of all. The
improvement is present for predictions of both stellar mass as well as inferred
quantities such as star formation rate and velocity dispersion which were not
included in the number density fits. We demonstrate that this method can also
be applied robustly and easily to observational data, and provide a code
package for doing so.

Moreover, galaxy samples with Mr < -20 and Mr < -20.5 favor strong central

should therefore be optimal targets to study the most massive systems in

a classical HyLIRG located at $z=$0.93 and hosting a radio-loud AGN ($L_{\rm

of extended ($r=160$ kpc), asymmetric X-ray emission in the soft 0.3-2.0 keV
band that has no radio counterpart. We therefore argue that the emission is of
thermal origin originating from a hot intragroup or intracluster medium
virializing in the potential. We find that the temperature ($\sim2$ keV) and
bolometric X-ray luminosity ($\sim3\times10^{43}$ erg s$^{-1}$) of the gas
follow the expected $L_{\rm X-ray}-T$ correlation for groups and clusters, and
that the gas has a remarkably short cooling time of $1.2$ Gyrs. In addition,
VLA radio observations reveal that the galaxy hosts an unresolved compact
steep-spectrum (CSS) source, most likely indicating the presence of a young
radio source similar to 3C186. We also confirm that the nucleus is dominated by
a redshifted 6.4 keV Fe K$\alpha$ line, strongly suggesting that the AGN is
Compton-thick. Finally, Hubble images reveal an over-density of galaxies and
sub-structure in the galaxy that correlates with soft X-ray emission. This
could be a snapshot view of on-going groupings expected in a growing cluster
environment. IRAS~F15307+3252 might therefore be a rare example of a group in
the process of transforming into a cluster.

observed planetary configuration has been shown to be unstable on a timescale
much shorter than the estimated age of the system (~ 30 Myr) unless the planets
are locked into mean motion resonances. This condition is characterised by
small-amplitude libration of one or more resonant angles that stabilise the
system by preventing close encounters. We simulate planetary systems similar to
the HR 8799 planetary system, exploring the parameter space in separation
between the orbits, planetary masses and distance from the Sun to the star. We
find systems that look like HR 8799 and remain stable for longer than the
estimated age of HR 8799. None of our systems are forced into resonances. We
find, with nominal masses and in a narrow range of orbit separations, that 5 of
100 systems match the observations and lifetime. Considering a broad range of
orbit separations, we find 12 of 900 similar systems. The systems survive
significantly longer because of their slightly increased initial orbit
separations compared to assuming circular orbits from the observed positions. A
small increase in separation leads to a significant increase in survival time.
The low eccentricity the orbits develop from gravitational interaction is
enough for the planets to match the observations. With lower masses, but still
comfortably within the estimated planet mass uncertainty, we find 18 of 100
matching and long-lived systems in a narrow orbital separation range. In the
broad separation range, we find 82 of 900 matching systems. Our results imply
that the planets in the HR 8799 system do not have to be in strong mean motion

distribution of molecular gas in high-redshift galaxies inaccessible to
existing methods. Our proposed approach is an extension of carbon monoxide
intensity mapping methods, which have garnered significant experimental
interest in recent years. These intensity mapping surveys target the 115 GHz
$^{12}$CO (1-0) line, but also contain emission from the substantially fainter
110 GHz $^{13}$CO (1-0) transition. The method leverages the information
contained in the $^{13}$CO line by cross-correlating pairs of frequency
channels in an intensity mapping survey. Since $^{13}$CO is emitted from the
same medium as the $^{12}$CO, but saturates at a much higher column density,
this cross-correlation provides valuable information about both the gas density
distribution and isotopologue ratio, inaccessible from the $^{12}$CO alone.
Using a simple model of these molecular emission lines, we show that a future
intensity mapping survey can constrain the abundance ratio of these two species
and the fraction of emission from optically thick regions to order $\sim30\%$.
These measurements cannot be made by traditional CO observations, and
consequently the proposed method will provide unique insight into the physics
of star formation, feedback, and galactic ecology at high redshifts.

therefore, can be combined with these to increase the discovery potential by
more than $200\%$ (depending on the spectra, of course). In fact, we find that
simple cuts on $\xi(p_T)$ along with cuts on MET, and the effective mass

ordering to produce a polar structure with nonzero spontaneous polarization
normal to the interfaces. This polarization is produced by electron transfer
between the V$^{3+}$ and V$^{4+}$ layers, and is comparable to that of
conventional ferroelectrics. The energy of this polar state relative to the
nonpolar ground state is only 3 meV per vanadium. Under tensile strain, this
energy difference can be further reduced, suggesting that the polar phase can
be induced by applied electric field, yielding an antiferroelectric
double-hysteresis loop. If the system does not switch back to the nonpolar

numbers to noninteger bases (so-called {\em $\beta$-expansions}) and the
infinite derivatives of a class of self-affine functions. Precisely, we extend
Okamoto's function (itself a generalization of the well-known functions of
Perkins and Katsuura) to a two-parameter family $\{F_{N,a}: N\in\mathbb{N},
a\in(0,1)\}$. We first show that for each $x$, $F_{N,a}'(x)$ is either $0$,
$\pm\infty$, or undefined. We then extend Okamoto's theorem by proving that for
each $N$, depending on the value of $a$ relative to a pair of thresholds, the
set $\{x: F_{N,a}'(x)=0\}$ is either empty, uncountable but Lebesgue null, or
of full Lebesgue measure. We compute its Hausdorff dimension in the second
case.
  The second result is a characterization of the set
$\mathcal{D}_\infty(a):=\{x:F_{N,a}'(x)=\pm\infty\}$, which enables us to
closely relate this set to the set of points which have a unique expansion in
the (typically noninteger) base $\beta=1/a$. Recent advances in the theory of
$\beta$-expansions are then used to determine the cardinality and Hausdorff
dimension of $\mathcal{D}_\infty(a)$, which depends qualitatively on the value
of $a$ relative to a second pair of thresholds.

""signaling"", in the presence of a constraint on the amount of communication. We
focus on the fundamental setting of bilateral trade, which in its simplest form
involves a seller with a single item to price, a buyer whose value for the item
is drawn from a common prior distribution over $n$ different possible values,
and a take-it-or-leave-it-offer protocol. A mediator with access to the buyer's
type may partially reveal such information to the seller in order to further
some objective such as the social welfare or the seller's revenue.
  In the setting of maximizing welfare under bilateral trade, we show that
$O(\log(n) \log \frac{1}{\epsilon})$ signals suffice for a $1-\epsilon$
approximation to the optimal welfare, and this bound is tight. As our main
result, we exhibit an efficient algorithm for computing a $\frac{M-1}{M} \cdot
(1-1/e)$-approximation to the welfare-maximizing scheme with at most M signals.
  For the revenue objective, we show that $\Omega(n)$ signals are needed for a
constant factor approximation to the revenue of a fully informed seller. From a
computational perspective, however, the problem gets easier: we show that a
simple dynamic program computes the signaling scheme with M signals maximizing
the seller's revenue.
  Observing that the signaling problem in bilateral trade is a special case of
the fundamental Bayesian Persuasion model of Kamenica and Gentzkow, we also
examine the question of communication-constrained signaling more generally. In
this model there is a sender (the mediator), a receiver (the seller) looking to
take an action (setting the price), and a state of nature (the buyer's type)
drawn from a common prior. We show that it is NP-hard to approximate the
optimal sender's utility to within any constant factor in the presence of
communication constraints.

activity with respect to sensory input or behavioral output. This is typically
achieved by regressing measured neural activity against known stimuli or
behavioral variables to produce a ""tuning function"" for each neuron.
Unfortunately, because this approach handles neurons individually, it cannot
take advantage of simultaneous measurements from spatially adjacent neurons
that often have similar tuning properties. On the other hand, sharing
information between adjacent neurons can errantly degrade estimates of tuning
functions across space if there are sharp discontinuities in tuning between
nearby neurons. In this paper, we develop a computationally efficient block
Gibbs sampler that effectively pools information between neurons to de-noise
tuning function estimates while simultaneously preserving sharp discontinuities
that might exist in the organization of tuning across space. This method is
fully Bayesian and its computational cost per iteration scales
sub-quadratically with total parameter dimensionality. We demonstrate the
robustness and scalability of this approach by applying it to both real and
synthetic datasets. In particular, an application to data from the spinal cord
illustrates that the proposed methods can dramatically decrease the
experimental time required to accurately estimate tuning functions.

rotational diffusion about minus-end attachment points contributes to
kinetochore capture in fission yeast, but the relative contributions of dynamic
instability and rotational diffusion are not well understood. We have developed
a biophysical model of kinetochore capture in small fission-yeast nuclei using
hybrid Brownian dynamics/kinetic Monte Carlo simulation techniques. With this
model, we have studied the importance of dynamic instability and microtubule
rotational diffusion for kinetochore capture, both to the lateral surface of a
microtubule and at or near its end. Over a range of biologically relevant
parameters, microtubule rotational diffusion decreased capture time, but made a
relatively small contribution compared to dynamic instability. At most,
rotational diffusion reduced capture time by 25%. Our results suggest that
while microtubule rotational diffusion can speed up kinetochore capture, it is
unlikely to be the dominant physical mechanism. In addition, we found that when
microtubules undergo dynamic instability, lateral captures predominate even in
the absence of rotational diffusion. Counterintuitively, adding rotational
diffusion to a dynamic microtubule increases the probability of end-on capture.

  ASPMT(QS) consists of a (qualitative) spatial representation module (QS) and
a method for turning tight ASPMT instances into Satisfiability Modulo Theories

formalise and implement concepts of default spatial reasoning and spatial frame

  In the classical version of the problem, the offline side of a bipartite
graph is known initially while vertices from the online side arrive one at a
time along with their incident edges. The objective is to maintain a decent
approximate matching from which no edge can be removed. Our generalization,
called Matroid Online Bipartite Matching, additionally requires that the set of
matched offline vertices be independent in a given matroid. In particular, the
case of partition matroids corresponds to the natural scenario where each
advertiser manages multiple ads with a fixed total budget.
  Our algorithms attain the same performance as the classical version of the

$1-1/e$-competitive algorithms for Matroid Online Bipartite Matching under the

theory tells us that the class group is also the Galois group of the Hilbert
class field, the maximal unramified abelian extension of k, so we could
equivalently say the expected number of unramified G-extensions of k is
1/#Aut(G) for a fixed abelian group G. We generalize this to asking for the
expected number of unramified G-extensions Galois over $\mathbb{Q}$ for a fixed
finite group G, with no restrictions placed on G. We review cases where the
answer is known or conjectured by Boston-Wood, Boston-Bush-Hajir, and Bhargava,
then answer this question in several new cases. In particular, we show when the
expected number is zero and give a nontrivial family of groups realizing this.

dihedral group $D_4$ of order 8 is infinite. Lastly, we discuss the special

telescope's point spread function (PSF) in radio astronomy are variants of the
CLEAN algorithm. Most of these algorithms model the sky brightness using the
delta-function basis, which results in undesired artefacts when used on image
extended emission. The adaptive scale pixel decomposition (Asp-Clean) algorithm
models the sky brightness on a scale-sensitive basis and thus gives a
significantly better imaging performance when imaging fields that contain both
resolved and unresolved emission.
  Aims. However, the runtime cost of Asp-Clean is higher than that of
scale-insensitive algorithms. In this paper, we identify the most expensive
step in the original Asp-Clean algorithm and present an efficient
implementation of it, which significantly reduces the computational cost while
keeping the imaging performance comparable to the original algorithm. The PSF
sidelobe levels of modern wide-band telescopes are significantly reduced,
allowing us to make approximations to reduce the computing cost, which in turn
allows for the deconvolution of larger images on reasonable timescales.
  Methods. As in the original algorithm, scales in the image are estimated
through function fitting. Here we introduce an analytical method to model
extended emission, and a modified method for estimating the initial values used
for the fitting procedure, which ultimately leads to a lower computational
cost.
  Results.The new implementation was tested with simulated EVLA data and the
imaging performance compared well with the original Asp-Clean algorithm. Tests
show that the current algorithm can recover features at different scales with
lower computational cost.

  Distributed Systems","Updated version with corrected proofs",,,,"cs.LO","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Time-Sensitive Distributed Systems (TSDS), such as applications using
autonomous drones, achieve goals under possible environment interference (\eg,
winds). Moreover, goals are often specified using explicit time constraints
which must be satisfied by the system \emph{perpetually}. For example, drones
carrying out the surveillance of some area must always have \emph{recent
pictures}, \ie, at most $M$ time units old, of some strategic locations. This
paper proposes a Multiset Rewriting language with explicit time for specifying
and analysing TSDSes. We introduce two properties, \emph{realizability} (some
trace is good) and \emph{survivability} (where, in addition, all admissible
traces are good). A good trace is an infinite trace in which goals are
perpetually satisfied. We propose a class of systems called \emph{progressive
timed systems} (PTS), where intuitively only a finite number of actions can be
carried out in a bounded time period. We prove that for this class of systems
both the realizability and the survivability problems are PSPACE-complete.
Furthermore, if we impose a bound on time (as in bounded model-checking), we
show that for PTS, realizability becomes NP-complete, while survivability is in
the $\Delta_2^p$ class of the polynomial hierarchy. Finally, we demonstrate
that the rewriting logic system Maude can be used to automate time bounded
verification of PTS.

the intergalactic medium (IGM) from X-ray binaries prior and during the epoch
of reionization. The cosmic evolution of compact binaries is followed using a
population synthesis technique that treats separately neutron stars and black
hole binaries in different spectral states and is calibrated to reproduce the
observed X-ray properties of galaxies at z<4. Together with an updated
empirical determination of the cosmic history of star formation, recent
modeling of the stellar mass-metallicity relation, and a scheme for absorption
by the IGM that accounts for the presence of ionized HII bubbles during the
epoch of reionization, our detailed calculations provide refined predictions of
the X-ray volume emissivity and filtered radiation background from ""normal""
galaxies at z>6. Radiative transfer effects modulate the background spectrum,
which shows a characteristic peak between 1 and 2 keV. While the filtering of
X-ray radiation through the IGM slightly increases the mean excess energy per
photoionization, it also weakens the radiation intensity below 1 keV, lowering
the mean photoionization and heating rates. Numerical integration of the rate
and energy equations shows that the contribution of X-ray binaries to the
ionization of the bulk IGM is negligible, with the electron fraction never
exceeding 1%. Direct HeI photoionizations are the main source of IGM heating,
and the temperature of the largely neutral medium in between HII cavities
increases above the temperature of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) only
at z<10, when the volume filling factor of HII bubbles is already >0.1.
Therefore, in this scenario, it is only at relatively late epochs that the bulk
of neutral intergalactic hydrogen may be observable in 21-cm emission against
the CMB.

exactly in such large-scale datasets that capturing any type of dependence is
of interest, so striking a favourable tradeoff between computational efficiency

extensive study of the use of large-scale kernel approximations in the context

$J/\psi\to\mu^+\mu^-$, $\phi\to K^+K^-$ decays is performed with a data sample
of 3 fb$^{-1}$ of $pp$ collision data collected at $\sqrt{s}=7$ and $8$ TeV
with the LHCb detector. The data cannot be described by a model that contains
only excited kaon states decaying into $\phi K^+$, and four $J/\psi\phi$
structures are observed, each with significance over $5$ standard deviations.
The quantum numbers of these structures are determined with significance of at
least $4$ standard deviations. The lightest has mass consistent with, but width
much larger than, previous measurements of the claimed $X(4140)$ state.

infinite sequence model and the prediction in the function model. Second, we
construct an asymptotically minimax predictive distribution when the parameter
space is a known ellipsoid. We show that the Bayesian predictive distribution
based on the Gaussian prior distribution is asymptotically minimax in the
ellipsoid. Third, we construct an asymptotically minimax predictive
distribution for any Sobolev ellipsoid. We show that the Bayesian predictive
distribution based on the product of Stein's priors is asymptotically minimax
for any Sobolev ellipsoid. Finally, we present an efficient sampling method
from the proposed Bayesian predictive distribution.

membrane along the standing-wave field of the cavity we tailor the dissipative
coupling between the membrane and the cavity, and we show that the dissipative
coupling can outweigh the dispersive coupling. Such a system, for which
controlled dissipation prevails dispersion, will prove useful for novel
laser-cooling schemes in optomechanics. In addition, we have determined the

estimating the value of a quantum system parameter. In general the optimum
quantum measurement, in the sense that it maximizes the quantum Fisher
information and hence allows one to minimize the estimation error, can only be
determined if the value of the parameter is already known. A modification of
the quantum Van Trees inequality, which gives a lower bound on the error in the
estimation of a random parameter, is proposed. The suggested inequality allows
us to assert if a particular quantum measurement, together with an appropriate
estimator, is optimal. An adaptive strategy to estimate the value of a
parameter, based on our modified inequality, is proposed.

General Relativity is the Kerr bound, which, for vacuum Kerr BHs, can be
expressed either in terms of the ADM or the horizon ""charges"". This bound,
however, is not a fundamental properties of General Relativity and stationary,
asymptotically flat, regular (on and outside an event horizon) BHs are known to
violate the Kerr bound, both in terms of their ADM and horizon quantities.
Examples include the recently discovered Kerr BHs with scalar or Proca hair.
Here, we point the fact that the Kerr bound in terms of horizon quantities is
also violated by well-known rotating and charged solutions, known in closed
form, such as the Kerr-Newman and Kerr-Sen BHs. For the former, moreover, we
observe that the Reissner-Nordstrom (RN) bound is also violated in terms of
horizon quantities, even in the static (i.e RN) limit. For the latter, by
contrast, the existence of charged matter outside the horizon, allows a curious
invariance of the charge to mass ratio, between ADM and horizon quantities.
Regardless of the Kerr bound violation, we show that in all case, the event
horizon linear velocity never exceeds the speed of light. Finally, we suggest a
new type of informative parameterization for BH spacetimes where part of the
asymptotic charges is supported outside the horizon.

effective-medium theories apply as in classical optics. In general the answer
is negative. For active plasmonics but also for some passive metamaterials, we
show that an additional effective-medium parameter is indispensable besides the
effective index, namely the effective noise-photon distribution. Only with the
extra parameter can one predict how well the quantumness of states of light is
preserved in the metamaterial. The fact that the effective index alone is not
always sufficient and that one additional effective parameter suffices in the
quantum optics of metamaterials is both of fundamental and practical interest.
Here from a Lagrangian description of the quantum electrodynamics of media with
both linear gain and loss, we compute the effective noise-photon distribution
for quantum light propagation in arbitrary directions in layered metamaterials,
thereby detailing and generalizing our recent work [ E. Amooghorban et al.,
Phys. Rev. Lett. ${\bf 110}$, 153602 (2013)]. The effective index with its
direction and polarization dependence is the same as in classical
effective-medium theories. As our main result we derive both for passive and
for active media how the value of the effective noise-photon distribution too
depends on the polarization and propagation directions of the light.
Interestingly, for TE-polarized light incident on passive metamaterials, the
noise-photon distribution reduces to a thermal distribution, but for
TM-polarized light it does not. We illustrate the robustness of our quantum
optical effective-medium theory by accurate predictions both for power spectra
and for balanced homodyne detection of output quantum states of the
metamaterial.

influence maximization discount allocation problem: given a social network and
budget, we need to decide to which initial set users should offer the
discounts, and how much should the discounts be worth. Our goal is to maximize
the number of customers who finally adopt the target product. We investigate
this problem under both non-adaptive and adaptive settings. In the first

$\frac{1}{2}(1 - 1/e)$ in non-adaptive setting. For the significantly more

are Hamilton-connected (except M(3), which is a cycle). For Keller graphs G(d),
we establish, in all cases, the exact value of the chromatic number, the
edge-chromatic number, and the independence number, and we get the clique
covering number in all cases except 5 <= d <= 7. We also investigate
Hamiltonian decompositions of Keller graphs, obtaining them up to G(6).

images is describing, where every topic is represented as a set of words.
Different from other problems like tag assignment or similar, a) we assume
multiple images are used as input instead of single image, b) Input images are
typically not visually related, c) Input images are not necessarily
semantically close, and d) Output word space is unconstrained. In our proposed
solution, visual information of each query image is used to retrieve similar
images with text labels (tags) from an image database. We consider a scenario
where the tags are very noisy and diverse, given that they were obtained by
implicit crowd-sourcing in a database of 1 million images and over seventy
seven thousand tags. The words or tags associated to each query are processed
jointly in a word selection algorithm using random walks that allows to refine
the search topic, rejecting words that are not part of the topic and produce a
set of words that fairly describe the topic. Experiments on a dataset of 300
topics, with up to twenty images per topic, show that our algorithm performs
better than the proposed baseline for any number of query images. We also
present a new Conditional Random Field (CRF) word mapping algorithm that
preserves the semantic similarity of the mapped words, increasing the
performance of the results over the baseline.

the case of relatively weak photoexcitation,the ferroelectric and the
spiral-spin order remains interlocked, both relaxing through spin-lattice
relaxation in the non-equilibrium state. When the additional optical pulse
illuminating sample is intense enough to induced a local phase transition
thermally, the system creates a metastable state of the bc-spiral-spin order
(with the electric polarization P//c) via supercooling across the first-order
phase transition between ab- and bc-spiral. The supercooled state of bc-spiral
spin is formed in the thermodynamical ground state of ab-spiral (P//a),
displaying a prolonged lifetime with strong dependence on the magnetic field
along the a-axis. The observed photo-switching between the two distinct
multiferroic states sheds light on novel photoinduced phenomena in spiral-spin
multiferroics.

point of two commuting orthogonal unit vectors. The combination of these unit
vectors leads to spherical harmonics and Schwinger's expression of the
second-quantized angular momentum states in terms of bosonic operators.
Commuting unit vectors can be turned into anticommuting ones by the restriction
to a single unit vector. This leads to Pauli spin matrices. By including
hyperbolic rotations, vectors can be given a finite norm and results from
special relativity and Dirac's equation are found. The assumption that the
change in four-momentum is due to the change in four-potential leads to the
electromagnetic field tensor and the Lorentz force. Mawell's equations are
obtained by viewing the four-potential as an harmonic oscillator driven by the
four-current. The Schr\""odinger equation is obtained from the nonrelativistic
limit of the four-momentum.

the Hansen particle size distributions to reproduce the extinction due to the
proposed dust haze. We apply our method to 23 young L dwarfs and 23 red field L
dwarfs. We constrain the properties of the dust haze including particle size
distribution and column density using Markov-Chain Monte Carlo methods. We find
that sub-micron range silicate grains reproduce the observed reddening. Current
brown dwarf atmosphere models include large grain (1--100~$\mu m$) dust clouds
but not submicron dust grains. Our results provide a strong proof of concept
and motivate a combination of large and small dust grains in brown dwarf
