monolayers suspended over SiN membranes micropatterned with holes of
non-circular geometry. We show that a uniform differential pressure load
$\Delta P$ over elliptical regions of free-standing graphene yields measurable
deviations from hydrostatic strain conventionally observed in
radially-symmetric microbubbles. The top hydrostatic strain $\bar{\varepsilon}$
we observe is estimated to be $\approx0.7\%$ for $\Delta P = 1\,{\rm bar}$ in
graphene clamped to elliptical SiN holes with axis $40$ and $20\,{\rm \mu m}$.
In the same configuration, we report a $G_\pm$ splitting of $10\,{\rm cm^{-1}}$
which is in good agreement with the calculated anisotropy $\Delta\varepsilon
\approx 0.6\%$ for our device geometry. Our results are consistent with the
most recent reports on the Gr\""uneisen parameters. Perspectives for the
achievement of arbitrary strain configurations by designing suitable SiN holes
and boundary clamping conditions are discussed.

concept at the heart of quantitative and computational linguistics. The entropy
has been established as a measure of this average uncertainty - also called
average information content. We here use parallel texts of 21 languages to
establish the number of tokens at which word entropies converge to stable
values. These convergence points are then used to select texts from a massively
parallel corpus, and to estimate word entropies across more than 1000

understand the performance of multilingual translation systems, and to
normalize semantic similarity measures.

  representation of noisy signals",,,,,"stat.ML cs.IT math.IT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Learning optimal dictionaries for sparse coding has exposed characteristic
sparse features of many natural signals. However, universal guarantees of the
stability of such features in the presence of noise are lacking. Here, we
provide very general conditions guaranteeing when dictionaries yielding the
sparsest encodings are unique and stable with respect to measurement or
modeling error. We demonstrate that some or all original dictionary elements
are recoverable from noisy data even if the dictionary fails to satisfy the
spark condition, its size is overestimated, or only a polynomial number of
distinct sparse supports appear in the data. Importantly, we derive these
guarantees without requiring any constraints on the recovered dictionary beyond
a natural upper bound on its size. Our results also yield an effective
procedure sufficient to affirm if a proposed solution to the dictionary
learning problem is unique within bounds commensurate with the noise. We
suggest applications to data analysis, engineering, and neuroscience and close
with some remaining challenges left open by our work.

of polarization modes of gravitational waves in modified theories, in
particular in $f(R)$ theories. In the latter ones, besides the usual two
transverse-traceless tensor modes present in general relativity, there are two
additional scalar ones: a massive longitudinal mode and a massless transverse
mode (the so-called breathing mode). This last mode has often been overlooked
in the literature, due to the assumption that the application of the Lorenz
gauge implies transverse-traceless wave solutions. We however show that this is
in general not possible and, in particular, that the traceless condition cannot
be imposed due to the fact that we no longer have a Minkowski background
metric. Our findings are in agreement with the results found using the
Newman-Penrose formalism, and thus clarify the inconsistencies found so far in
the literature.

the direct detection of dark matter using a multi-ton liquid xenon time

experimentally accessible parameter space for Weakly Interacting Massive
Particles (WIMPs) in a wide mass-range, until neutrino interactions with the
target become an irreducible background. The prompt scintillation light and the
charge signals induced by particle interactions in the xenon will be observed
by VUV sensitive, ultra-low background photosensors. Besides its excellent
sensitivity to WIMPs above a mass of 5 GeV/c2, such a detector with its large
mass, low-energy threshold and ultra-low background level will also be
sensitive to other rare interactions. It will search for solar axions, galactic
axion-like particles and the neutrinoless double-beta decay of 136-Xe, as well
as measure the low-energy solar neutrino flux with <1% precision, observe
coherent neutrino-nucleus interactions, and detect galactic supernovae. We

equations formulated in the basis of a 14-band ${\mathbf k} \cdot {\mathbf p}$
model is employed to compute the temporal dynamics of photocurrents in GaAs
quantum wells following the excitation with femtosecond laser pulses. This
approach provides a transparent description of the interband, intersubband, and
intraband excitations, fully includes all resonant as well as off-resonant
excitations, and treats the light-matter interaction non-perturbatively. For
linearly polarized excitations the photocurrents contain contributions from
shift and rectification currents. We numerically compute and analyze these
currents generated by the excitation with femtosecond laser pulses for [110]-
and [111]-oriented GaAs quantum wells. It is shown that the often employed
perturbative $\chi^{(2)}$-approach breaks down for peak fields larger than
about 10~kV/cm and that non-perturbative effects lead to a reduction of the
peak values of the shift and rectification currents and to temporal
oscillations which originate from Rabi flopping. In particular, we find a
complex oscillatory photon energy dependence of the magnitudes of the shift and
rectification currents. Our simulations demonstrate that this dependence is the
result of mixing between the heavy- and light-hole valence bands. This is a
surprising finding since the bandmixing has an even larger influence on the
strength of the photocurrents than the absorption coefficient. For
[110]-oriented GaAs quantum wells the calculated photon energy dependence is
compared to experimental results and a good agreement is obtained which
validates our theoretical approach.

a binary (high-order) submodular energy of a graphical model. Recently, it was
shown that this problem can be solved to a global optimum, for many practically
interesting diversity measures. It was noted that the labelings are, so-called,
nested. This nestedness property also holds for labelings of a class of
parametric submodular minimization problems, where different values of the
global parameter $\gamma$ give rise to different solutions. The popular example
of the parametric submodular minimization is the monotonic parametric max-flow
problem, which is also widely used for computing multiple labelings. As the
main contribution of this work we establish a close relationship between
diversity with submodular energies and the parametric submodular minimization.
In particular, the joint M-best diverse labelings can be obtained by running a
non-parametric submodular minimization (in the special case - max-flow) solver
for M different values of $\gamma$ in parallel, for certain diversity measures.
Importantly, the values for $\gamma$ can be computed in a closed form in
advance, prior to any optimization. These theoretical results suggest two
simple yet efficient algorithms for the joint M-best diverse problem, which
outperform competitors in terms of runtime and quality of results. In
particular, as we show in the paper, the new methods compute the exact M-best
diverse labelings faster than a popular method of Batra et al., which in some
sense only obtains approximate solutions.

contains an open set. This provides an affirmative answer to Taken's Last
Problem (F. Takens (2008) Nonlinearity, 21(3) T33--T36). A limited solution
with historic behaviour is one for which the time averages do not converge as
time goes to infinity. Takens' problem asks for dynamical systems where
historic behaviour occurs persistently for initial conditions in a set with
positive Lebesgue measure.
  The family appears in the unfolding of a degenerate differential equation
whose flow has an asymptotically stable heteroclinic cycle involving
two-dimensional connections of non-trivial periodic solutions. We show that the
degenerate problem also has historic behaviour, since for an open set of
initial conditions starting near the cycle, the time averages approach the
boundary of a polygon whose vertices depend on the centres of gravity of the
periodic solutions and their Floquet multipliers.

attacker can follow to compromise network resources by analysing network
vulnerabilities and topology. These representations are a powerful tool for
security risk assessment. Bayesian inference on attack graphs enables the
estimation of the risk of compromise to the system's components given their
vulnerabilities and interconnections, and accounts for multi-step attacks
spreading through the system. Whilst static analysis considers the risk posture
at rest, dynamic analysis also accounts for evidence of compromise, e.g. from
SIEM software or forensic investigation. However, in this context, exact
Bayesian inference techniques do not scale well. In this paper we show how
Loopy Belief Propagation - an approximate inference technique - can be applied
to attack graphs, and that it scales linearly in the number of nodes for both
static and dynamic analysis, making such analyses viable for larger networks.
We experiment with different topologies and network clustering on synthetic
Bayesian attack graphs with thousands of nodes to show that the algorithm's
accuracy is acceptable and converge to a stable solution. We compare sequential
and parallel versions of Loopy Belief Propagation with exact inference
techniques for both static and dynamic analysis, showing the advantages of
approximate inference techniques to scale to larger attack graphs.

several orders of magnitude higher than those observed on the Sun. The
interaction between the two and its implications on planetary habitability is
of great interest to the community. Stellar Proton Events interact with
planetary atmospheres, generate secondary particles and increase the radiation
dose on the surface. This effect is amplified for close-in exoplanets and can
be a serious threat to potential planetary life. Monte Carlo simulations are
used to model the SPE-induced particle radiation dose on the surface of such
exoplanets. The results show a wide range of surface radiation doses on planets
in close-in configurations with varying atmospheric column depths, magnetic
moments and orbital radii. It can be concluded that for close-in exoplanets
with sizable atmospheres and magnetospheres, the radiation dose contributed by
stellar superflares may not be high enough to sterilize a planet (for life as

motions in different evolutionary stages of massive star formation: 54 infrared
dark clouds (IRDCs), 69 high-mass protostellar object (HMPOs), and 54
ultra-compact HII regions (UCHIIs). The inflow asymmetry in HCN spectra seems
to be prevalent throughout all the three evolutionary phases, with IRDCs
showing the largest excess in blue profile. In the case of HNC spectra, the
prevalence of blue sources does not appear, excepting for IRDCs. We suggest
that this line is not appropriate to trace inflow motion in evolved stages of
massive star formation because the abundance of HNC decreases at high
temperatures. This result spotlights the importance of considering chemistry in
the dynamics study of massive star-forming regions. The fact that the IRDCs
show the highest blue excess in both transitions indicates that the most active
inflow occurs in the early phase of star formation, i.e., the IRDC phase rather
than in the later phases. However, mass is still inflowing onto some UCHIIs. We
also found that the absorption dips of the HNC spectra in 6 out of 7 blue
sources are red-shifted relative to their systemic velocities. These
red-shifted absorption dips may indicate global collapse candidates, although
mapping observations with better resolution are needed to examine this feature
in more detail.

especially since simultaneous recordings of large neuronal population have
become possible in the past three decades. These large recordings pose a

In this paper we propose a new algorithm based on sparse convolution coding
which is also able to find ensembles with temporal structure. Application of
our algorithm to synthetically generated datasets shows that it outperforms
previous work and is able to accurately identify temporal cell ensembles even
when those contain overlapping neurons or when strong background noise is

the capacity region of two-user erasure interference channels with delayed
knowledge of the channel state information and spatially correlated channels.
There are instances where spatial correlation eliminates any potential gain
from delayed channel state information and instances where it enables the same
performance that is possible with instantaneous knowledge of channel state. The
key is an extremal entropy inequality for spatially correlated channels that
separates the two types of instances. It is also shown that to achieve the

chaotic with a surprisingly small Lyapunov time scale of order its orbital
period. In this work we analyse the origin of chaos in Halley's orbit and the
growth of perturbations, in order to get a better understanding of this
unusually short time scale. We perform N-body simulations to model Halley's
orbit in the Solar System and measure the separation between neighbouring
trajectories. To be able to interpret the numerical results, we use a
semi-analytical map to demonstrate different growth modes, i.e. linear,
oscillatory or exponential, and transitions between these modes. We find the
Lyapunov time scale of Halley's orbit to be of order 300 years, which is
significantly longer than previous estimates in the literature. This
discrepancy could be due to the different methods used to measure the Lyapunov
time scale. A surprising result is that next to Jupiter, also encounters with
Venus contribute to the exponential growth in the next 3000 years. Finally, we
note an interesting application of the sub-linear, oscillatory growth mode to
an ensemble of bodies moving through the Solar System. Whereas in the absence
of encounters with a third body the ensemble spreads out linearly in time, the
accumulation of weak encounters can increase the lifetime of such systems due
to the oscillatory behaviour.

investigations to be carried out with this unique data set: cosmic inflation,
interstellar and circumstellar ices, and the extra-galactic background light.
It is readily apparent, however, that many other questions in astrophysics and
planetary sciences could be addressed with the SPHEREx data. The SPHEREx team
convened a community workshop in February 2016, with the intent of enlisting
the aid of a larger group of scientists in defining these questions. This paper
summarizes the rich and varied menu of investigations that was laid out. It
includes studies of the composition of main belt and Trojan/Greek asteroids;
mapping the zodiacal light with unprecedented spatial and spectral resolution;
identifying and studying very low-metallicity stars; improving stellar
parameters in order to better characterize transiting exoplanets; studying
aliphatic and aromatic carbon-bearing molecules in the interstellar medium;
mapping star formation rates in nearby galaxies; determining the redshift of
clusters of galaxies; identifying high redshift quasars over the full sky; and
providing a NIR spectrum for most eROSITA X-ray sources. All of these
investigations, and others not listed here, can be carried out with the nominal
all-sky spectra to be produced by SPHEREx. In addition, the workshop defined
enhanced data products and user tools which would facilitate some of these

  Peer-Prediction Makes Things Worse",,,,,"cs.GT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In many settings, an effective way of evaluating objects of interest is to
collect evaluations from dispersed individuals and to aggregate these
evaluations together. Some examples are categorizing online content and
evaluating student assignments via peer grading. For this data science problem,
one challenge is to motivate participants to conduct such evaluations carefully
and to report them honestly, particularly when doing so is costly. Existing
approaches, notably peer-prediction mechanisms, can incentivize truth telling
in equilibrium. However, they also give rise to equilibria in which agents do
not pay the costs required to evaluate accurately, and hence fail to elicit
useful information. We show that this problem is unavoidable whenever agents
are able to coordinate using low-cost signals about the items being evaluated
(e.g., text labels or pictures). We then consider ways of circumventing this
problem by comparing agents' reports to ground truth, which is available in
practice when there exist trusted evaluators---such as teaching assistants in
the peer grading scenario---who can perform a limited number of unbiased (but
noisy) evaluations. Of course, when such ground truth is available, a simpler
approach is also possible: rewarding each agent based on agreement with ground
truth with some probability, and unconditionally rewarding the agent otherwise.
Surprisingly, we show that the simpler mechanism achieves stronger incentive
guarantees given less access to ground truth than a large set of
peer-prediction mechanisms.

Standard Model and novel physics. The axial charge is a fundamental parameter
describing the weak interactions of nucleons. The scalar and tensor charges
probe novel interactions at the TeV scale in neutron and nuclear
$\beta$-decays, and the flavor-diagonal tensor charges $g^{u}_T$, $g^{d}_T$ and
$g^{s}_T$ are needed to quantify the contribution of the quark electric dipole
moment (EDM) to the neutron EDM. The 9 ensembles, generated by the MILC
Collaboration using the HISQ action with 2+1+1 dynamical flavors, span three
lattice spacings $a \approx 0.06, 0.09$ and 0.12 fm and light-quark masses
corresponding to the pion masses $M_\pi \approx 135, 225$ and 315 MeV.
High-statistics estimates on five ensembles using the all-mode-averaging method
allow us to quantify all systematic uncertainties and perform a simultaneous
extrapolation in the lattice spacing, lattice volume and light-quark masses for
the connected contributions. Our final estimates, in the $\overline{\text{MS}}$
scheme at 2 GeV, of the isovector charges are $g_A^{u-d} = 1.195(33)(20)$,
$g_S^{u-d} = 0.97(12)(6) $ and $g_T^{u-d} = 0.987(51)(20)$. The first error
includes statistical and all systematic uncertainties except that due to the
extrapolation Ansatz, which is given by the second error estimate. Combining
our estimate for $g_S^{u-d}$ with the difference of light quarks masses
$(m_d-m_u)^{\rm QCD}=2.67(35)$ MeV given by FLAG, we obtain $(M_N-M_P)^{\rm
QCD} = 2.59(49)$ MeV. Estimates of the connected part of the flavor-diagonal
tensor charges of the proton are $g^{u}_T=0.792(42)$ and $g^{d}_T=-0.194(14)$.
Combining our new estimates with precision low-energy experiments, we update
constraints on novel scalar and tensor interactions, $\epsilon_{S,T}$, at the
TeV scale.

magnetically coupling the mechanical motion to a dressed three-level system
provided by a Nitrogen-vacancy center in the nanoparticle. Quantum coherence
between the dressed levels is created via microwave fields to induce a
two-phonon transition, which results in mechanical squeezing. Remarkably, we
find that in ultrahigh vacuum quantum squeezing is achievable at room
temperature with feedback cooling. For moderate vacuum, quantum squeezing is
possible with cryogenic temperature. Second, we present a setup for two
mechanical modes coupled to the dressed three levels, which results in two-mode
squeezing analogous to the mechanism of the single-mode case. In contrast to
previous works, our study provides a deterministic method for engineering
macroscopic squeezed states without the requirement for a cavity.

of an SLE$_{\kappa'}$ curve ($\kappa' = 16/\kappa > 4$). In these extremes,
this leads to a new proof of the Hausdorff dimension formula for SLE.
  We also consider SLE$_\kappa(\rho)$ processes, which were originally only
defined for $\rho > -2$, but which can also be defined for $\rho \leq -2$ using
L\'evy compensation. The range of an SLE$_\kappa(\rho)$ is qualitatively
different when $\rho \leq -2$. In particular, these curves are
self-intersecting for $\kappa < 4$ and double points are dense, while ordinary
SLE$_\kappa$ is simple. It was previously shown (Miller-Sheffield, 2016) that
certain SLE$_\kappa(\rho)$ curves agree in law with certain light cones.
Combining this with other known results, we obtain a general formula for the
Hausdorff dimension of SLE$_\kappa(\rho)$ for all values of $\rho$.
  Finally, we show that the Hausdorff dimension of the so-called SLE$_\kappa$
fan is the same as that of ordinary SLE$_\kappa$.

study the case where the flat-field across each exposure or detector is

strategy connects different observations with at least a minimum amount of

reconstructed jet. We introduce a new semi-inclusive fragmenting jet function
${\mathcal G}^h_i(z= \omega_J/\omega,z_h=\omega_h/\omega_J,\omega_J, R,\mu)$,
which depends on the jet radius $R$ and the large light-cone momenta of the
parton `$i$' initiating the jet ($\omega$), the jet ($\omega_J$), and the
hadron $h$ ($\omega_h$). The jet fragmentation function can then be expressed
as a semi-inclusive observable, in the spirit of actual experimental
measurements, rather than as an exclusive one. We demonstrate the consistency
of the effective field theory treatment and standard perturbative QCD
calculations of this observable at next-to-leading order (NLO). The

X-ray observations provide estimates of the absorbing equivalent hydrogen
column density N_H based on spectral fits. Near-infrared extinction values are
calculated from intrinsic and observed colour magnitudes (J-H) and (H-K_s) as
given by the VISTA Orion A survey. A linear fit of the correlation between
column density and extinction values A_V yields an estimate of the N_H/A_V
ratio. We investigate systematic uncertainties of the results by describing and
(if possible) quantifying the influence of circumstellar material and the
adopted extinction law, X-ray models, and elemental abundances on the N_H/A_V
ratio. Assuming a Galactic extinction law with R_V=3.1 and solar abundances by
Anders & Grevesse (1989), we deduce an N_H/A_V ratio of (1.39 +- 0.14) x 10^21
cm^-2 mag^-1 for Class III sources in the Orion Nebula Cluster where the given
error does not include systematic uncertainties. This ratio is consistent with
similar studies in other star-forming regions and approximately 31% lower than
the Galactic value. We find no obvious trends in the spatial distribution of
N_H/A_V ratios. Changes in the assumed extinction law and elemental abundances
are demonstrated to have a relevant impact on deduced A_V and N_H values,

collisional, regardless of its behaviour on galaxy scales. Our calculations
show a spike in the central density profile, with properties determined by the
dark matter microphysics, and the densities can reach the `mean density' of a
black hole (from dividing the black-hole mass by the volume enclosed by the
Schwarzschild radius). For a galaxy halo of given compactness
($\chi=2GM/Rc^2$), certain values for the dark matter entropy yield a dense
central object lacking an event horizon. For some soft equations of state of
the SIDM (e.g. $F\ge6$), there are multiple horizonless solutions at given
compactness. Although light propagates around and through a sphere composed of
dark matter, it is gravitationally lensed and redshifted. While some
calculations give non-singular solutions, others yield solutions with a central
singularity. In all cases the density transitions smoothly from the central
body to the dark-matter envelope around it, and to the galaxy's dark matter
halo. We propose that pulsar timing observations will be able to distinguish
between systems with a centrally dense dark matter sphere (for different
equations of state) and conventional galactic nuclei that harbour a
supermassive black hole.

we characterize the molecular ISM at 60pc resolution in the Antennae, the Large

from galaxy to galaxy. The 60pc resolution line width and molecular gas surface
density correlate well, which is a fundamental behavior expected for virialized

low-dimensional Euclidean space given a set of constraints in the form of
distance comparisons like ""item $i$ is closer to item $j$ than item $k$"".
Ordinal constraints like this often come from human judgments. To account for
errors and variation in judgments, we consider the noisy situation in which the
given constraints are independently corrupted by reversing the correct
constraint with some probability. This paper makes several new contributions to
this problem. First, we derive prediction error bounds for ordinal embedding
with noise by exploiting the fact that the rank of a distance matrix of points
in $\mathbb{R}^d$ is at most $d+2$. These bounds characterize how well a
learned embedding predicts new comparative judgments. Second, we investigate
the special case of a known noise model and study the Maximum Likelihood
estimator. Third, knowledge of the noise model enables us to relate prediction
errors to embedding accuracy. This relationship is highly non-trivial since we
show that the linear map corresponding to distance comparisons is
non-invertible, but there exists a nonlinear map that is invertible. Fourth,
two new algorithms for ordinal embedding are proposed and evaluated in
experiments.

that this two component dark matter can be realized in the Inert Doublet Model
in an elegant and natural manner by virtue of the spontaneous breaking of a
Peccei-Quinn $U(1)_{PQ}$ symmetry into a residual $Z_2$ symmetry. The WIMP
stability is guaranteed by the $Z_{2}$ symmetry and a new dark matter
component, the axion, arises. There are two interesting outcomes: (i)
vector-like quarks needed to implement the Peccei-Quinn symmetry in the model
act as a portal between the dark sector and the SM fields with a
supersymmetry-type phenomenology at colliders; (ii) two-component Inert Doublet

show that the model can plausibly have two component dark matter and at the

disks may be explained by planet-disk interactions. At ~145 pc, 2MASS
J16042165-2130284 (J1604) is a 5-12 Myr old transitional disk with different
gap sizes in the mm- and $\mu$m-sized dust distributions (outer edges at ~79
and at ~63 au, respectively). Its $^{12}$CO emission shows a ~30 au cavity.
This radial structure suggests that giant planets are sculpting this disk. We
aim to constrain the masses and locations of plausible giant planets around
J1604. We observed J1604 with the Spectro-Polarimetric High-contrast Exoplanet
REsearch (SPHERE) at the Very Large Telescope (VLT), in IRDIFS\_EXT,
pupil-stabilized mode, obtaining YJH- band images with the integral field
spectrograph (IFS) and K1K2-band images with the Infra-Red Dual-beam Imager and
Spectrograph (IRDIS). The dataset was processed exploiting the angular
differential imaging (ADI) technique with high-contrast algorithms. Our
observations reach a contrast of $\Delta K, YH$ ~12 mag from 0.15"" to 0.80""
(~22 to 115 au), but no planet candidate is detected. The disk is directly
imaged in scattered light at all bands from Y to K, and it shows a red color.
This indicates that the dust particles in the disk surface are mainly
$\gtrsim0.3\,\mu$m-sized grains. We confirm the sharp dip/decrement in
scattered light in agreement with polarized light observations. Comparing our
images with a radiative transfer model we argue that the southern side of the
disk is most likely the nearest. This work represents the deepest search yet
for companions around J1604. We reach a mass sensitivity of $\gtrsim
2-3M_{Jup}$ from ~22 to ~115 au according to a hot start scenario. We propose
that a brown dwarf orbiting inside of ~15 au and additional Jovian planets at
larger radii could account for the observed properties of J1604 while
explaining our lack of detection.

squark discovery reach is significantly reduced in Dirac gluino models relative
to the Majorana case. However, if the squark and gluino masses are close the
reach is similar in both scenarios. We also consider the electroweak fine
tuning of theories observable at such a collider, and the impact of existing
constraints from flavour and CP violating observables. Models with Majorana
gluinos that are fine tuned to less than one part in 10,000 can typically be
discovered or excluded, and Dirac models with tuning of one part in 1,000 can
be probed. The flavour structure of Majorana models is highly constrained if
they have observable squarks, while O(1) violation is possible in accessible
Dirac models. In both cases new sources of CP violation must be very
suppressed. Future collider searches can also give important information on
possible dark matter candidates. We study the relation of this to indirect and

massive star clusters in the range of $\sim 10^{5.5} - 10^{7.5}\,

galaxy interactions. The nascent cluster-forming clouds have high gas pressures
in the range of $P/k \sim 10^8 - 10^{12}\, \rm{K}\,\rm{cm^{-3}}$, which is
$\sim 10^4 - 10^8$ times higher than the typical pressure of the interstellar

cloud in the Antennae Galaxies. Furthermore, these massive star clusters have
quasi-lognormal initial mass functions with a peak around $\sim 10^{6}\,

processes, but the shape and the peak of the mass functions do not change
significantly during the course of galaxy collisions. Our results suggest that
gas-rich galaxy mergers may provide a favorable environment for the formation

that the IMBH readily forms a binary with a BH companion. This binary is
gradually hardened by transient 3-body or 4-body encounters, leading to
frequent substitutions of the BH companion, while the binary's eccentricity
experiences large amplitude oscillations due to the Lidov-Kozai resonance. We
also demonstrate suppression of these resonances by the relativistic precession
of the binary orbit. We find an intermediate mass-ratio inspiral in one of the

evolution, the IMBH merges with a BH companion. The IMBH--BH binary inspiral
starts in the eLISA frequency window ($\gtrsim 1\rm mHz$) when the binary

$47\%\pm7\%$ of hot Jupiter systems have stellar companions with semi-major
axes between 50-2000 AU. This is 2.9 times larger than the field star companion
fraction in this separation range, with a significance of $4.4\sigma$. In the

stellar companions to hot Jupiter systems peaks at small values and therefore
differs from that of field star binaries which tend to be uniformly distributed
across all mass ratios. We conclude that either wide separation stellar
binaries are more favorable sites for gas giant planet formation at all
separations, or that the presence of stellar companions preferentially causes
the inward migration of gas giant planets that formed farther out in the disk
via dynamical processes such as Kozai-Lidov oscillations. We determine that

sometimes have to sift through a large number of low-quality or irrelevant
answers to find out the answer which satisfies their information need. To
alleviate this, the problem of Answer Quality Prediction (AQP) aims to predict
the quality of an answer posted in response to a forum question. Current AQP
systems either learn models using - a) various hand-crafted features (HCF) or
b) use deep learning (DL) techniques which automatically learn the required
feature representations.
  In this paper, we propose a novel approach for AQP known as - ""Deep Feature
Fusion Network (DFFN)"" which leverages the advantages of both hand-crafted
features and deep learning based systems. Given a question-answer pair along
with its metadata, DFFN independently - a) learns deep features using a
Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and b) computes hand-crafted features using
various external resources and then combines them using a deep neural network
trained to predict the final answer quality. DFFN achieves state-of-the-art
performance on the standard SemEval-2015 and SemEval-2016 benchmark datasets
and outperforms baseline approaches which individually employ either HCF or DL
based techniques alone.

Data analysis, there was a vast development in the field of linear and
nonlinear dimension reduction techniques in recent years. These techniques
(sometimes referred to as manifold learning) assume that the scattered input
data is lying on a lower dimensional manifold, thus the high dimensionality
problem can be overcome by learning the lower dimensionality behavior. However,
in real life applications, data is often very noisy. In this work, we propose a
method to approximate $\mathcal{M}$ a $d$-dimensional $C^{m+1}$ smooth
submanifold of $\mathbb{R}^n$ ($d \ll n$) based upon noisy scattered data
points (i.e., a data cloud). We assume that the data points are located ""near""
the lower dimensional manifold and suggest a non-linear moving least-squares
projection on an approximating $d$-dimensional manifold. Under some mild
assumptions, the resulting approximant is shown to be infinitely smooth and of
high approximation order (i.e., $O(h^{m+1})$, where $h$ is the fill distance
and $m$ is the degree of the local polynomial approximation). The method
presented here assumes no analytic knowledge of the approximated manifold and
the approximation algorithm is linear in the large dimension $n$. Furthermore,
the approximating manifold can serve as a framework to perform operations
directly on the high dimensional data in a computationally efficient manner.
This way, the preparatory step of dimension reduction, which induces
distortions to the data, can be avoided altogether.

with sizeable magnetic dipole moments has created a new type of fluid, known as
a quantum ferrofluid, which combines the extraordinary properties of
superfluidity and ferrofluidity. A hallmark of superfluids is that they are
constrained to rotate through vortices with quantized circulation. In quantum
ferrofluids the long-range dipolar interactions add new ingredients by inducing
magnetostriction and instabilities, and also affect the structural properties
of vortices and vortex lattices. Here we give a review of the theory of
vortices in dipolar Bose-Einstein condensates, exploring the interplay of
magnetism with vorticity and contrasting this with the established behaviour in
non-dipolar condensates. We cover single vortex solutions, including structure,
energy and stability, vortex pairs, including interactions and dynamics, and
also vortex lattices. Our discussion is founded on the mean-field theory
provided by the dipolar Gross-Pitaevskii equation, ranging from analytic
treatments based on the Thomas-Fermi (hydrodynamic) and variational approaches
to full numerical simulations. Routes for generating vortices in dipolar
condensates are discussed, with particular attention paid to rotating
condensates, where surface instabilities drive the nucleation of vortices, and
lead to the emergence of rich and varied vortex lattice structures. We also
present an outlook, including potential extensions to degenerate Fermi gases,
quantum Hall physics, toroidal systems and the Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless
transition.

concrete model realizations of this picture utilized a hypercubic space-time
scaffolding, which, together with many advantages, also has some disadvantages,
e.g., in the treatment of vortex topological charge. In the present work, we
explore a center vortex model which does not rely on such a scaffolding.
Vortices are represented by closed random lines in continuous 2+1-dimensional
space-time. These random lines are modeled as being piece-wise linear, and an
ensemble is generated by Monte Carlo methods. The physical space in which the
vortex lines are defined is a torus with periodic boundary conditions. Besides
moving, growing and shrinking of the vortex configurations, also reconnections
are allowed. Our ensemble therefore contains not a fixed, but a variable number
of closed vortex lines. This is expected to be important for realizing the
deconfining phase transition. We study both vortex percolation and the
potential V (R) between quark and anti-quark as a function of distance R at
different vortex densities, vortex segment lengths, reconnection conditions and
at different temperatures. We find three deconfinement phase transitions, as a
function of density, as a function of vortex segment length, and as a function
of temperature.

survive to increasingly greater depths in a star and their surface abundances
indicate the depth and thoroughness of mixing in the star. We have
(re)determined Li abundances/upper limits for 79 Hyades dwarfs, Be for 43

Boesgaard et al. Models of rotational mixing produce good agreement with the
relative depletions of Be and B in the dip region. We have compared our nLTE B
abundances for the three high B stars on either side of the Li-Be dip with
those found by Duncan et al. for the two Hyades giants. This confirms the

lock-and-key-binding mechanisms, with the ability of appropriately sized
atomically thin membranes to flex substantially in response to sub-nanonewton
forces. We employ carefully designed numerical simulations and theoretical
estimates to demonstrate excellent (79 % to 86 %) raw target detection accuracy
at ~70 million bases per second and electrical measurability of the detected
events. In addition, we demonstrate reliable detection of repeated DNA motifs.
Finally, we argue that the use of a nanoscale opening (nanopore) is not
requisite for the operation of the proposed sensor and present a simplified
sensor geometry without the nanopore as part of the sensing element. Our
results therefore potentially suggest a realistic, inherently base-specific,
high-throughput electronic DNA sequencing device as a cost-effective de-novo
alternative to the existing methods.

practices within our community, we rarely assess workshops through careful
consideration of how they engage faculty. Initial evidence suggests that
workshop leaders often overlook central tenets of education research that are
well-established in classroom contexts, such as the role of interactivity in
enabling student learning. As such, there is a need to develop more robust,
evidence-based models of how best to support faculty learning in professional
development contexts, and to activity support workshop leaders in relating
their design decisions to familiar ideas form other educational contexts. In
response to these needs, we have developed an observation tool, the Real-Time
Professional Development Observation Tool (R-PDOT), to document the form and
focus of faculty's engagement during workshops. In this paper, we describe the
motivation and methodological considerations behind the development of the
R-PDOT, justify our decisions to highlight particular aspects of workshop
sessions, and demonstrate how the R-PDOT can be used to analyze three sessions
from the Physics and Astronomy New Faculty Workshop. We also justify the
accessibility and potential utility of the R-PDOT output as a reflective tool
using preliminary data from interviews with workshop leaders, and consider the
roles the R-PDOT could play in supporting future research on faculty
professional development.

oxidised form is involved in the removal of trace elements from ocean waters.
Recently, a large number of highly accurate Mn measurements have been obtained
in the Atlantic, Indian and Arctic Oceans as part of the GEOTRACES programme.
The goal of this study is to combine these new observations with
state-of-the-art modelling to give new insights into the main sources and
redistribution of Mn throughout the ocean. To this end, we simulate the
distribution of dissolved Mn using a global-scale circulation model. This first
model includes simple parameterisations to account, realistically, for the
sources, processes and sinks of Mn in the ocean. Whereas oxidation and
(photo)reduction, as well as aggregation and settling are parameterised in the
model, biological uptake is not yet taken into account by the model. Our model
reproduces observations accurately and provides the following insights:
  - The high surface concentrations of manganese are caused by the combination
of photoreduction and sources to the upper ocean. The most important sources
are dust, then sediments, and, more locally, rivers.
  - Results show that surface Mn in the Atlantic Ocean moves downwards into the
North Atlantic Deep Water, but because of strong removal rates the Mn does not
propagate southwards.
  - There is a mostly homogeneous background concentration of dissolved Mn of
about 0.10 to 0.15 nM throughout most of the deep ocean. The model reproduces
this by means of a threshold on manganese oxides of 25 pM, suggesting that a
minimal concentration of Mn is needed before aggregation and removal become
efficient.
  - The observed sharp hydrothermal signals are produced by assuming both a
high source and a strong removal of Mn near hydrothermal vents.

Machines (RBM) are accurate models for CF that also lack interpretability. In
this paper, we focus on RBM based collaborative filtering recommendations, and
further assume the absence of any additional data source, such as item content

investigate their dependence on the magnetic field frequency, and analyze the

equation. For arbitrary amplitudes, the frequency dependence of these
quantities is obtained from the numerical solution of this equation. The impact
of transitions between different regimes of regular and chaotic dynamics of

  We give explicit upper and lower bounds for the rate function of the
perimeter in terms of the rate function of the increments. These bounds
coincide and thus give the rate function for a wide class of distributions
which includes the Gaussians and the rotationally invariant ones. For random
walks with such increments, large deviations of the perimeter are attained by
the trajectories that asymptotically align into line segments. However, line
segments may not be optimal in general.
  Furthermore, we find explicitly the rate function of the area of the convex
hull for random walks with rotationally invariant distribution of increments.
For such walks, which necessarily have zero mean, large deviations of the area
are attained by the trajectories that asymptotically align into half-circles.
For random walks with non-zero mean increments, we find the rate function of
the area for Gaussian walks with drift. Here the optimal limit shapes are
elliptic arcs if the covariance matrix of increments is non-degenerate and
parabolic arcs if otherwise.
  The above results on convex hulls of Gaussian random walks remain valid for
convex hulls of planar Brownian motions of all possible parameters. Moreover,
we extend the LDPs for the perimeter and the area of convex hulls to general
Levy processes with finite Laplace transform.

communications. When parallel frequency channels are used for multiuser
transmission, the channel bandwidths and user power are adjusted to maximize
the sum information rate with the bandwidth budget, the transmit power budget,
and the user-specific rate requirements. The maximum sum rate is used in
measuring the energy efficiency. With fixed or flexible bandwidths of the
frequency channels, practical methods are developed to find the total transmit
power with the unique optimal resource (bandwidth and power) allocation for
maximum energy efficiency. This resource allocation ensures that, while each
user's minimum rate requirement is satisfied, all the excess resource of the
spectrum and transmit power is dedicated to the one user with the best channel
quality. Simulation results validate the optimal solutions of total transmit
power and resource allocation that support the energy-efficient multiuser
transmission.

provides a quantitative bound on the privacy cost of an algorithm that operates
on sensitive information. Several tools have been developed for the formal
verification of differentially private algorithms, including program logics and
type systems. However, these tools do not capture fundamental techniques that
have emerged in recent years, and cannot be used for reasoning about
cutting-edge differentially private algorithms. Existing techniques fail to
handle three broad classes of algorithms: 1) algorithms where privacy depends
accuracy guarantees, 2) algorithms that are analyzed with the advanced
composition theorem, which shows slower growth in the privacy cost, 3)
algorithms that interactively accept adaptive inputs.
  We address these limitations with a new formalism extending apRHL, a
relational program logic that has been used for proving differential privacy of
non-interactive algorithms, and incorporating aHL, a (non-relational) program
logic for accuracy properties. We illustrate our approach through a single
running example, which exemplifies the three classes of algorithms and explores
new variants of the Sparse Vector technique, a well-studied algorithm from the
privacy literature. We implement our logic in EasyCrypt, and formally verify
privacy. We also introduce a novel coupling technique called \emph{optimal
subset coupling} that may be of independent interest.

this causes the entire malware population to be non-stationary. Contrary to

assumed that the distribution of the observed malware characteristics (i.e.,

adapt to the drift and evolution in malware population, an online

achieves 84.29% accuracy outperforming two state-of-the-art malware techniques

the modified ideal negative result measurement scheme on a three-level system.
Once these assumptions are tested, the violation becomes small, despite the
fact that the LG value itself is large. Our results showcase the advantages of
using the modified measurement scheme that can reach the higher LG values, as

problem of secure transmission in a relay-assisted network, where a pair of
legitimate user equipments (UEs) communicate with the aid of a multiple-input
multiple output (MIMO) relay in the presence of multiple eavesdroppers (eves).
Assuming imperfect knowledge of the eves' channels, we jointly optimize the
power of the source UE, the amplify-and-forward (AF) relaying matrix and the
covariance of the artificial noise (AN) transmitted by the relay, in order to
maximize the received signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) at the
destination, while imposing a set of robust secrecy constraints. To tackle the
resultant nonconvex optimization problem, a globally optimal solution based on
a bi-level optimization framework is proposed, but with high complexity. Then a
low-complexity sub-optimal method relying on a new penalized
difference-of-convex (DC) algorithmic framework is proposed, which is
specifically designed for non-convex semidefinite programs (SDPs). We show how
this penalized DC framework can be invoked for solving our robust secure
relaying problem with proven convergence. Our extensive simulation results show
that both proposed solutions are capable of ensuring the secrecy of the
relay-aided transmission and significantly improve the robustness towards the
eves' channel uncertainties as compared to the non-robust counterparts. It is
also demonstrated the penalized DC-based method advocated yields a performance
close to the globally optimal solution.

ultimately require new physical laws or principles. Here, we propose a
corresponding ""hard problem of life"" as the problem of how `information' can

as a causal agent is central to explaining life, and why it is hard - that is,
why we suspect that a full resolution of the hard problem of life will, similar
to as has been proposed for the hard problem of consciousness, ultimately not
be reducible to known physical principles.

consistent with thin disks seen at an appreciable inclination angle), and (iii)
radial colour gradients (bluer outwards) decrease in an absolute sense from
significant age-related gradients to a residual level consistent with the
metallicity-induced gradients seen in low redshift cluster members. The
distribution of their effective radii shows some evidence of evolution,
consistent with growth of {\it at most} a factor $<1.5$ between $z\sim 1.4$ and
$z \sim 0.5$, significantly less than for comparable field galaxies, while the

evolution at least at $z<1$. A simple model involving the fading and thickening
of a disk component after comparatively recent quenching (after $z\sim 1.5$)
around an otherwise passively evolving older spheroid component is consistent

so far. In this work, we upgrade the accretion disc model (Li & Cao 2008),
which assumed the variability is caused by the change of global mass accretion
rate, by constraining the disc size to match the viscous timescale of accretion
disc to the variability timescale observed and by including the
irradiation/X-ray reprocessing to make the emitted spectrum become steeper. We
find this hybrid model can reproduce the observed bluer-when-brighter trend
quite well, which is used to validate the theoretical model by several works
recently. The traditional correlation between the variability amplitude and
rest-frame wavelength can also be well fitted by our model. In addition, a weak
positive correlation between variability amplitude and black hole mass is
present, qualitatively consistent with recent observations.

  Methods: We perform hydrodynamic implicit large-eddy simulations of
compressible convection using the MUltidimensional Stellar Implicit Code
(MUSIC). Because MUSIC has been designed to use realistic stellar models
produced from one-dimensional stellar evolution calculations, MUSIC simulations
are capable of seamlessly modeling a whole star. Simulations in two-dimensional
spherical shells that have different radial extents are performed over hundreds
of convective turnover times, permitting the collection of well-converged
statistics.
  Results: We evaluate basic statistics of the convective turnover time, the
convective velocity, and the overshooting layer. These quantities are selected
for their relevance to one-dimensional stellar evolution calculations, so that
our results are focused toward the 321D link. The inclusion in the spherical
shell of the boundary between the radiative and convection zones decreases the
amplitude of convective velocities in the convection zone. The inclusion of
near-surface layers in the spherical shell can increase the amplitude of
convective velocities, although the radial structure of the velocity profile
established by deep convection is unchanged. The impact from including the
near-surface layers depends on the speed and structure of small-scale
convection in the near-surface layers. Larger convective velocities in the
convection zone result in a commensurate increase in the overshooting layer
width and decrease in the convective turnover time. These results provide
support for non-local aspects of convection.

variable is hidden in the sense that for getting full information about it one

This latter issue is tackled by recent works dealing with deep representation

fine-grained latent representations of both words and their semantic relations.
In this paper, we review the main approaches of neural-based document ranking

macroscopic superpositions disappear under thermalization while they may be
preserved in the MBL phase in which thermalization does not occur.

process to increase the amount of dust in galaxies. We show here that this
hypothesis encounters severe difficulties that make it unfit to explain the

Dust growth in the diffuse ISM phases is hampered by (a) too slow accretion
rates; (b) too high dust temperatures, and (c) the Coulomb barrier that
effectively blocks accretion. In molecular clouds these problems are largely
alleviated. Grains are cold (but not colder than the CMB temperature, (Tcmb =
20 K at redshift z=6). However, in dense environments accreted materials form
icy water mantles, perhaps with impurities. Mantles are immediately
photo-desorbed as grains return to the diffuse ISM at the end of the cloud
lifetime, thus erasing any memory of the growth. We conclude that dust
attenuating stellar light at high-$z$ must be ready-made stardust largely
produced in supernova ejecta.

We find that the Pauli blocking effect is weak in the $\Lambda nn$ system,
while it is strong in the $\Sigma^-nn$ system. The appearance of the $\Sigma^-$

coloring, called complex coloring, to the scheduling problems of input queued
switches. The proposed distributed parallel scheduling algorithm possesses two
important features: optimality and rearrangeability. Optimality ensures that
the algorithm always returns a proper coloring with the minimum number of
required colors, and rearrangeability allows partially re-coloring the existing
connection patterns if the underlying graph only changes slightly. The running
time of the proposed scheduling algorithm is on the order of $O(\log^2 N)$ per
frame, and the amortized time complexity, the time to compute a matching per
timeslot, is only $O(\log N)$. The scheduling algorithm is highly robust in the
face of traffic fluctuations. Since the higher the variable density, the higher
the efficiency of the variable elimination process, complex coloring provides a
natural adaptive solution to non-uniform input traffic patterns. The proposed
scheduling algorithm for packet switching can achieve nearly 100% throughput.

discontinuity of the radial distribution of the penumbral filaments in
correspondence with the LB, which shows a dark lane (about 0.3"" wide and about
8.0"" long) along its main axis. The available data were inverted with the
Stokes Inversion based on Response functions (SIR) code and physical parameters

derived from the Doppler effect shows motions towards and away from the
observer up to 0.6 km/s, which are lower in value than the LOS velocities
observed in the neighbouring penumbral filaments. The noteworthy result is that
we find motions toward the observer up to 0.6 km/s in the dark lane where the
LB is located between two umbral cores, while the LOS velocity motion toward
the observer is strongly reduced where the LB is located between an umbral core
at one side and penumbral filaments on the other side. Statistically, the LOS
velocities correspond to upflows/downflows andcomparing these results with
Hinode/SP data, we conclude that the surrounding magnetic field configuration

enables deterministic end-to-end computation in a single forward pass.
Specifically, DPN extends a contemporary CNN to model unary terms and
additional layers are devised to approximate the mean field (MF) algorithm for

recent works that required many iterations of MF during back-propagation, DPN
is able to achieve high performance by approximating one iteration of MF.
Second, DPN represents various types of pairwise terms, making many existing
models as its special cases. Furthermore, pairwise terms in DPN provide a
unified framework to encode rich contextual information in high-dimensional

on standard semantic image/video segmentation benchmarks, where a single DPN

fundamental problem in many signal processing applications, e.g., spectral
analysis and direction-of- arrival estimation. Recently, this problem has been
address using prior information in form of a jointly sparse signal structure. A
prominent approach for exploiting joint sparsity considers mixed-norm
minimization in which, however, the problem size grows with the number of
measurements and the desired resolution, respectively. In this work we derive
an equivalent, compact reformulation of the $\ell_{2,1}$ mixed-norm
minimization problem which provides new insights on the relation between
different existing approaches for jointly sparse signal reconstruction. The
reformulation builds upon a compact parameterization, which models the
row-norms of the sparse signal representation as parameters of interest,
resulting in a significant reduction of the MMV problem size. Given the sparse
vector of row-norms, the jointly sparse signal can be computed from the MMVs in
closed form. For the special case of uniform linear sampling, we present an
extension of the compact formulation for gridless parameter estimation by means
of semidefinite programming. Furthermore, we derive in this case from our
compact problem formulation the exact equivalence between the $\ell_{2,1}$
mixed-norm minimization and the atomic-norm minimization. Additionally, for the

radio-frequency (RF) transmission enabled wireless energy transfer (WET). By
optimally designing the waveforms from multiple energy transmitters (ETs) over
the wireless channels, they can be constructively combined at the energy
receiver (ER) to achieve an EB gain that scales with the number of ETs.
However, the optimal design of EB waveforms requires accurate channel state
information (CSI) at the ETs, which is challenging to obtain practically,
especially in a distributed system with ETs at separate locations. In this
paper, we study practical and efficient channel training methods to achieve
optimal EB in a distributed WET system. We propose two protocols with and
without centralized coordination, respectively, where distributed ETs either
sequentially or in parallel adapt their transmit phases based on a
low-complexity energy feedback from the ER. The energy feedback only depends on
the received power level at the ER, where each feedback indicates one
particular transmit phase that results in the maximum harvested power over a
set of previously used phases. Simulation results show that the two proposed
training protocols converge very fast in practical WET systems even with a
large number of distributed ETs, while the protocol with sequential ET phase
adaptation is also analytically shown to converge to the optimal EB design with
perfect CSI by increasing the training time. Numerical results are also
provided to evaluate the performance of the proposed distributed EB and
training designs as compared to other benchmark schemes.

  To verify the algorithm, the complex student behaviour is modelled using a

fitting of all the molecular line data, including previous maps and single-dish

  We confirm the presence of a rotating equatorial disk and an outflow, which
is mainly formed of gas leaving the disk. The mass of the disk is ~ 0.01 Mo,
and that of the CO-rich outflow is ~ 10 times smaller. High temperatures of ~
100 K are derived for most components. From comparison of the mass values, we
roughly estimate the lifetime of the rotating disk, which is found to be of
about 10000 yr. Taking data of a few other post-AGB composite nebulae into
account, we find that the lifetimes of disks around post-AGB stars typically
range between 5000 and more than 20000 yr. The angular momentum of the disk is
found to be high, ~ 9 Mo AU km/s, which is comparable to that of the stellar
system at present. Our observations of H13CN show a particularly wide velocity
dispersion and indicate that this molecule is only abundant in the inner
Keplerian disk, at ~ 60 AU from the stellar system. We suggest that HCN is
formed in a dense photodissociation region (PDR) due to the UV excess known to
be produced by the stellar system, following chemical mechanisms that are well
established for interstellar medium PDRs and disks orbiting young stars. We
further suggest that this UV excess could lead to the efficient formation and
excitation of PAHs and other C-bearing macromolecules, whose emission is very

Ratio, especially at high b-values. Acquiring data at high b-values contains
relevant information and is now of great interest for microstructural and
connectomics studies. High noise levels bias the measurements due to the
non-Gaussian nature of the noise, which in turn can lead to a false and biased
estimation of the diffusion parameters. Additionally, the usage of in-plane
acceleration techniques during the acquisition leads to a spatially varying
noise distribution, which depends on the parallel acceleration method
implemented on the scanner. This paper proposes a novel diffusion MRI denoising
technique that can be used on all existing data, without adding to the scanning
time. We first apply a statistical framework to convert the noise to Gaussian
distributed noise, effectively removing the bias. We then introduce a spatially
and angular adaptive denoising technique, the Non Local Spatial and Angular
Matching (NLSAM) algorithm. Each volume is first decomposed in small 4D
overlapping patches to capture the structure of the diffusion data and a
dictionary of atoms is learned on those patches. A local sparse decomposition
is then found by bounding the reconstruction error with the local noise
variance. We compare against three other state-of-the-art denoising methods and
show quantitative local and connectivity results on a synthetic phantom and on
an in-vivo high resolution dataset. Overall, our method restores perceptual
information, removes the noise bias in common diffusion metrics, restores the
extracted peaks coherence and improves reproducibility of tractography. Our
work paves the way for higher spatial resolution acquisition of diffusion MRI
datasets, which could in turn reveal new anatomical details that are not

community.

timely recommendations in order to extend the period of independent living.
Extracting individual process models showing user behavior is an important
instrument in achieving this goal. However, the interpretation of sensor data
at an appropriate abstraction level is not straightforward. For example, a
motion sensor in a bedroom can be triggered by tossing and turning in bed or by
getting up. We try to derive the actual activity depending on the context
(time, previous events, etc.). In this paper we introduce the notion of label
refinements, which links more abstract event descriptions with their more
refined counterparts. We present a statistical evaluation method to determine
the usefulness of a label refinement for a given event log from a process
perspective. Based on data from smart homes, we show how our statistical
evaluation method for label refinements can be used in practice. Our method was
able to select two label refinements out of a set of candidate label
refinements that both had a positive effect on model precision.

for the formation of planets. By enhancing the solid surface density and
increasing the sticking efficiency, ice catalyzes the rapid formation of
planetesimals and decreases the time scale for giant planet core accretion.
Aims: In this paper we analyse the composition of the outer disk around the
Herbig star HD~142527. We focus on the composition of the water ice, but also
analyse the abundances of previously proposed minerals. Methods: We present new
Herschel far infrared spectra and a re-reduction of archival data from the
Infrared Space Observatory (ISO). We model the disk using full 3D radiative
transfer to obtain the disk structure. Also, we use an optically thin analysis
of the outer disk spectrum to obtain firm constraints on the composition of the
dust component. Results: The water ice in the disk around HD~142527 contains a
large reservoir of crystalline water ice. We determine the local abundance of
water ice in the outer disk (i.e. beyond 130\,AU). The re-reduced ISO spectrum
differs significantly from that previously published, but matches the new
Herschel spectrum at their common wavelength range. In particular, we do not
detect any significant contribution from carbonates or hydrous silicates, in
contrast to earlier claims. Conclusions: The amount of water ice detected in
the outer disk requires $\sim80\,$\% of the oxygen atoms. This is comparable to
the water ice abundance in the outer solar system, in comets and in dense
interstellar clouds. The water ice is highly crystalline while the temperatures
where we detect it are too low to crystallize the water on relevant time
scales. We discuss the implications of this finding.

estimation of the population mean. As usual in semi-supervised settings, there
exists an unlabeled sample of covariate vectors and a labeled sample consisting
of covariate vectors along with real-valued responses (""labels""). Otherwise,
the formulation is ""assumption-lean"" in that no major conditions are imposed on
the statistical or functional form of the data. We consider both the ideal
semi-supervised setting where infinitely many unlabeled samples are available,
as well as the ordinary semi-supervised setting in which only a finite number
of unlabeled samples is available.
  Estimators are proposed along with corresponding confidence intervals for the
population mean. Theoretical analysis on both the asymptotic distribution and
$\ell_2$-risk for the proposed procedures are given. Surprisingly, the proposed
estimators, based on a simple form of the least squares method, outperform the
ordinary sample mean. The simple, transparent form of the estimator lends
confidence to the perception that its asymptotic improvement over the ordinary
sample mean also nearly holds even for moderate size samples. The method is
further extended to a nonparametric setting, in which the oracle rate can be
achieved asymptotically. The proposed estimators are further illustrated by

  in endothelial cells",,,,,"q-bio.BM q-bio.SC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Vascular endothelial growth factor receptors (VEGFRs) are receptor tyrosine
kinases (RTKs) that regulate proliferation, migration, angiogenesis and
vascular permeability of endothelial cells. VEGFR1 and VEGFR2 bind vascular
endothelial growth factors (VEGFs), inducing receptor dimerisation and
activation, characterised by phosphorylation of tyrosine residues in their
cytoplasmic domain. Although experimental evidence suggests that RTK signalling
occurs both on the plasma membrane and intra-cellularly, and reveals the role
of endocytosis in RTK signal transduction, we still lack knowledge of VEGFR
phosphorylation-site use and of the spatiotemporal regulation of VEGFR
signalling. In this paper, we introduce four stochastic mathematical models to
study the binding kinetics of vascular endothelial growth factor VEGF-A to
VEGFR1 and VEGFR2, and phosphorylation. The formation of phosphorylated dimers
on the cell surface is a two-step process: diffusive transport and binding. The
first two of our models only consider VEGFR2, which allows us to introduce new
stochastic descriptors making use of a matrix-analytic approach. The two
remaining models describe the competition of VEGFR1 and VEGFR2 for ligand
availability, and are analysed making use of Gillespie simulations and the van
Kampen approximation. Under the hypothesis that bound phosphorylated receptor
dimers are the signalling units, we study the time to reach a threshold number
of such complexes. Our results indicate that the presence of VEGFR1 does not
only affect the timescale to reach a given signalling threshold, but it also
affects the maximum attainable threshold. This result is consistent with the
conjectured role of VEGFR1 as a decoy receptor, that prevents VEGF-A binding to
VEGFR2, and thus, VEGFR2 attaining suitable phosphorylation levels. We identify
an optimum range of ligand concentration for sustained dimer phosphorylation.

equation is considered: it can be written as $r_t = r_{xx} + 2r_x r$. The
structural properties of the admitted recursion operator are studied; thus, it
is proved to be a strong symmetry for the mirror non-Abelian Burgers equation
as well as to be the hereditary. These results are proved via direct
computations as well as via computer assisted manipulations; ad hoc routines
are needed to treat non-Abelian quantities and relations among them. The
obtained recursion operator generates the $mirror$ non-Abelian Burgers
hierarchy. The latter, when the unknown operator $r$ is replaced by a real
valued function reduces to the usual (commutative) Burgers hierarchy.
Accordingly, also the recursion operator reduces to the usual Burgers one.

progenitor/descendant links between observed galaxy populations at different
epochs. However, this method breaks down in the presence of galaxy mergers, or
when galaxies experience stochastic growth rates. We present a simple analytic
framework to treat the physical processes that drive the evolution and
diffusion of galaxies within comoving number density space. The evolution in
mass rank order of a galaxy population with time is influenced by the galaxy
coagulation rate and galaxy ""mass rank scatter"" rate. We quantify the relative
contribution of these two effects to the mass rank order evolution. We show
that galaxy coagulation is dominant at lower redshifts and stellar masses,
while scattered growth rates dominate the mass rank evolution at higher
redshifts and stellar masses. For a galaxy population at $10^{10} M_\odot$,
coagulation has been the dominant effect since $z=2.2$, but a galaxy population
at $10^{11} M_\odot$ was dominated by mass rank scatter until $z=0.6$. We show
that although the forward and backward median number density evolution tracks
are asymmetric, the backward median number density evolution can be obtained by
convolving the descendant distribution function with progenitor relative
abundances. We tabulate fits for the median number density evolution and
scatter which can be applied to improve the way galaxy populations are linked

that when process discovery algorithms are only able to discover an

states in disordered one-dimensional interacting electron systems across the
transition to a many-body localized phase. Drude weights are proportional to
the spectral curvatures induced by magnetic fluxes in mesoscopic rings. They
offer a method to relate the transition to the many-body localized phase to
transport properties. In the delocalized regime, we find that the Drude weight
distribution at a fixed disorder configuration agrees well with the
random-matrix-theory prediction $P(D) \propto (\gamma^2+D^2)^{-3/2}$, although
the distribution width $\gamma$ strongly fluctuates between disorder
realizations. A crossover is observed towards a distribution with different
large-$D$ asymptotics deep in the many-body localized phase, which however
differs from the commonly expected Cauchy distribution. We show that the
average distribution width $\langle \gamma\rangle $, rescaled by $L\Delta$,
$\Delta$ being the average level spacing in the middle of the spectrum and $L$
the systems size, is an efficient probe of the many-body localization
transition, as it increases/vanishes exponentially in the delocalized/localized
phase.

cluster mergers and giant radio halos (RH), suggesting that these sources can
be used as probes of the cluster merging rate with cosmic time. In this paper
we carry out an explorative study that combines the observed fractions of
merging clusters (fm) and RH (fRH) with the merging rate predicted by
cosmological simulations and attempt to infer constraints on merger properties
of clusters that appear disturbed in X-rays and of clusters with RH. We use
morphological parameters to identify merging systems and analyze the currently
largest sample of clusters with radio and X-ray data (M500>6d14 Msun, and
0.2<z<0.33, from the Planck SZ cluster catalogue). We found that in this sample
fm~62-67% while fRH~44-51%. The comparison of the theoretical f_m with the
observed one allows to constrain the combination (xi_m,tau_m), where xi_m and
tau_m are the minimum merger mass ratio and the timescale of merger-induced
disturbance. Assuming tau_m~ 2-3 Gyr, as constrained by simulations, we find
that the observed f_m matches the theoretical one for xi_m~0.1-0.18. This is
consistent with optical and near-IR observations of clusters in the sample
(xi_m~0.14-0.16). The fact that RH are found only in a fraction of merging
clusters may suggest that merger events generating RH are characterized by
larger mass ratio; this seems supported by optical/near-IR observations of RH
clusters in the sample (xi_min~0.2-0.25). Alternatively, RH may be generated in
all mergers but their lifetime is shorter than \tau_m (by ~ fRH/fm). This is an
explorative study, however it suggests that follow up studies using the
forthcoming radio surveys and adequate numerical simulations have the potential
to derive quantitative constraints on the link between cluster merging rate and
RH at different cosmic epochs and for different cluster masses.

entails stability, but this is no longer sufficient when jobs/customers of
different classes (i.e. with different service requirements and/or routing

of McQNs are lacking, in general. In this note we design a numerical
(simulation-based) method for determining the stability region of a McQN, in
terms of arrival rate(s). Our method exploits certain (stochastic) monotonicity
properties enjoyed by the associated Markovian queue-configuration process.
Stochastic monotonicity is a quite common feature of queueing models and can be
easily established in the single-class framework (Jackson networks); recently,
also for a wide class of McQNs, including first-come-first-serve (FCFS)
networks, monotonicity properties have been established. Here, we provide a
minimal set of conditions under which the method performs correctly.
Eventually, we illustrate the use of our numerical method by presenting a set
of numerical experiments, covering both single and multi-class networks.

natural robustness against the thermally induced dephasing, which extends the
coherence time of the measurement protocol. Furthermore, we introduce sensing

saccade generation in scene viewing as a case study for our approach. For this
model, the likelihood function can be computed directly by numerical
simulation, which enables more efficient parameter estimation including
Bayesian inference to obtain reliable estimates and corresponding credible
intervals. Using hierarchical models inference is even possible for individual
observers. Furthermore, our likelihood approach can be used to compare
different models. In our example, the dynamical framework is shown to
outperform non-dynamical statistical models. Additionally, the likelihood based
evaluation differentiates model variants, which produced indistinguishable
predictions on hitherto used statistics. Our results indicate that the

large. For this reason, Parallel and Distributes Simulation techniques have
been proposed to take advantage of multiple execution units which are found in
multicore processors, cluster of workstations or HPC systems. The current
generation of HPC systems includes hundreds of thousands of computing nodes and
a vast amount of ancillary components. Despite improvements in manufacturing
processes, failures of some components are frequent, and the situation will get
worse as larger systems are built. In this paper we describe FT-GAIA, a
software-based fault-tolerant extension of the GAIA/ART\`IS parallel simulation
middleware. FT-GAIA transparently replicates simulation entities and
distributes them on multiple execution nodes. This allows the simulation to
tolerate crash-failures of computing nodes; furthermore, FT-GAIA offers some
protection against byzantine failures since synchronization messages are
replicated as well, so that the receiving entity can identify and discard
corrupted messages. We provide an experimental evaluation of FT-GAIA on a
running prototype. Results show that a high degree of fault tolerance can be
achieved, at the cost of a moderate increase in the computational load of the
execution units.

Electron Multiplier (M-THGEM) is presented. The M-THGEM is a novel hole-type
gaseous electron multiplier produced by multi-layer printed circuit board
technology; it consists of a densely perforated assembly of multiple insulating
substrate sheets (e.g., FR-4), sandwiched between thin metallic-electrode
layers. The electron avalanche processes occur along the successive
multiplication stages within the M-THGEM holes, under the action of strong
dipole fields resulting from the application of suitable potential differences
between the electrodes. The present work focuses on investigation of two
different geometries: a two-layer M-THGEM (either as single or double-cascade
detector) and a single three-layer M-THGEM element, tested in various
low-pressure He-based gas mixtures. The intrinsically robust confinement of the
avalanche volume within the M-THGEM holes provides an efficient suppression of
the photon-induced secondary effects, resulting in a high-gain operation over a
broad pressure range, even in pure noble gas. The operational principle, main
properties (maximum achievable gain, long-term stability, energy resolution,
etc.) under different irradiation conditions, as well as capabilities and
potential applications are discussed.

propose a mathematically rigorous approach to this prob- lem, including static
saliency maps of each video frame for the calculation of the optical flow.
Taking into account static saliency maps for calculating the optical flow
allows for overcoming the aperture problem. Our ap- proach is able to explain
human fixation behavior in situations which pose challenges to standard
approaches, such as when a fixated object disappears behind an occlusion and
reappears after several frames. In addition, we quantitatively compare our

of the hidden supergroup give rise to the correct gauge transformations of the
p-forms of the FDA.
  This interpretation is actually valid for any supergravity containing
antisymmetric tensor fields, and any supersymmetric FDA can always be traded
for a hidden Lie superalgebra containing extra fermionic nilpotent generators.
As an interesting example we construct the hidden superalgebra associated with
the FDA of N=2, D=7 supergravity. In this case we are able to parametrize the
mutually non local 2- and 3-form B^(2) and B^(3) in terms of hidden 1-forms and
find that supersymmetry and gauge invariance require in general the presence of
two nilpotent fermionic generators in the hidden algebra. We propose that our
approach, where all the invariances of the FDA are expressed as Lie derivatives
of the $p$-forms in the hidden supergroup manifold, could be an appropriate
framework to discuss theories defined in enlarged versions of superspace

the spectra are encoded in the vanishing of a quantum Riemann theta function.

highly nontrivial coincidence between the two quantization schemes requires
infinite constraints among the refined Gopakumar-Vafa invariants. The
equivalence for mirror curves of genus one has been verified for some local del
Pezzo surfaces. In this paper, we generalize the correspondence to higher
genus, and analyze in detail the resolved $\mathbb{C}^3/\mathbb{Z}_5$ orbifold
and several $SU(N)$ geometries. We also give a proof for some models at
$\hbar=2\pi/k$.

$T_{\mathrm{N}}=0.47\,$K, the temperature of antiferromagnetic ordering of
$3d$-electron spins of Fe$^{3+}$ localized in the insulating anion layers, a
non-saturating linear $R(T)$ dependence has been observed. A weak
superconducting signal has been detected in the antiferromagnetic state, at
temperatures $\leq 0.2\,$K. Despite the very high crystal quality, only a tiny
fraction of the sample appears to be superconducting. Besides a small kink
feature in the resistivity, the impact of the antiferromagnetic ordering of
localized Fe$^{3+}$ spins on the conduction $\pi$-electron system is clearly
manifested in the Fermi surface reconstruction, as evidenced by Shubnikov-de
Haas oscillations. The ""magnetic field -- temperature"" phase diagrams for the
field directions parallel to each of the three principal crystal axes have been
determined. For magnetic field along the easy axis a spin-flop transition has
been found. Similarities and differences between the present material and the

main obstacle in the challenging quest to detect primordial B-modes in the
polarized microwave sky. We make use of the Planck-HFI 2015 data release at
high frequencies to place new constraints on the properties of the polarized
thermal dust emission at high Galactic latitudes. Here, we specifically study
the spatial variability of the dust polarized spectral energy distribution, and
its potential impact on the determination of the tensor-to-scalar ratio. We use
the correlation ratio of the $C_\ell^{BB}$ angular power spectra between the
217- and 353-GHz channels as a tracer of these potential variations, computed
on different high Galactic latitude regions, ranging from 80% to 20% of the
sky. The new insight from Planck data is a departure of the correlation ratio
from unity that cannot be attributed to a spurious decorrelation due to the
cosmic microwave background, instrumental noise, or instrumental systematics.
The effect is marginally detected on each region, but the statistical
combination of all the regions gives more than 99% confidence for this
variation in polarized dust properties. In addition, we show that the
decorrelation increases when there is a decrease in the mean column density of
the region of the sky being considered, and we propose a simple power-law
empirical model for this dependence, which matches what is seen in the Planck
data. We explore the effect that this measured decorrelation has on simulations
of the BICEP2-Keck Array/Planck analysis and show that the 2015 constraints
from those data still allow a decorrelation between the dust at 150 and 353GHz
of the order of the one we measure. Finally we show that either spatial
variation of the dust SED or of the dust polarization angle could produce
decorrelations between 217- and 353-GHz data similar to those we observe in the
data.

telescope. The adopted baseline design is a prime focus telescope with a
segmented primary of 11.25m aperture, with speed f/1.93 and 1.52deg
field-of-view, optimized for wavelengths 360-1800nm. The Wide-Field Corrector
(WFC) has five aspheric lenses, mostly of fused silica, with largest element
1.33m diameter and total glass mass 788kg. The Atmospheric Dispersion Corrector
(ADC) is of the compensating lateral type, combining a motion of the entire WFC
via the hexapod, with a restoring motion for a single lens. There is a modest
amount of vignetting (average 5% over the hexagonal field); this greatly
improves image quality, and allows the design to be effectively pupil-centric.
The polychromatic image quality is d80<0.225""/0.445"" at ZD 0/60deg over more
than 95% of the hexagonal field-of-view. The ADC action allows adjustment of
the plate-scale with zenith distance, which is used to halve the image motions
caused by differential refraction. A simple design is presented for achieving
the required ADC lens shifts and tilts. A two-mirror design was also undertaken
for MSE, but was not selected. This is a 12.3m F/2.69 forward Cassegrain
design, with a 2.75m diameter M2, and three silica lenses, of largest diameter
1.33m. The field-of-view is again 1.52deg. The f/0.95 primary makes the design
remarkably compact, being under 10m long. The ADC action involves a small
motion of M2 (again via a hexapod), and shifts and tilts of a single lens. The
design is effectively pupil-centric, with modest vignetting (5.9% average). The
image quality is virtually identical to the prime focus design.

explicit inclusion of nonlocality in (d,p) reactions. Purpose: The goal of this
work is to extend previous studies to (d,n) reactions, which, although similar
to (d,p), have specific properties that merit inspection. Method: We apply our
methods (both the distorted wave Born approximation and the adiabatic wave
approximation) to $(d,n)$ reactions on $^{16}$O, $^{40}$Ca, $^{48}$Ca,
$^{126}$Sn, $^{132}$Sn, and $^{208}$Pb at $20$ and $50$ MeV. Results: We look
separately at the modifications introduced by nonlocality in the final bound
and scattering states, as well as the consequences reflected on the
differential angular distributions. The cross sections obtained when using
nonlocality explicitly are significantly different than those using the local
approximation, just as in (d,p). Due to the particular role of Coulomb in the
bound state, often we found the effects of nonlocality to be larger in (d,n)
than in (d,p). Conclusions: Our results confirm the importance of including
nonlocality explicitly in deuteron induced reactions.

nonlinear matrix equations using lattice adjunctions, stability and

Bose-Einstein condensates (BECs) systems. Many studies have been done on atomic
BECs with time- and space- modulated nonlinearities, while there is few work
considering the atomic-molecular BECs with space-modulated nonlinearities.
Here, we obtain two kinds of Jacobi elliptic solutions and a family of rational
solutions of the atomic-molecular BECs with trapping potential and
space-modulated nonlinearity and consider the effect of three-body interaction
on the localized matter wave solutions. The topological properties of the
localized nonlinear matter wave for no coupling are analysed: the parity of
nonlinear matter wave functions depends only on the principal quantum number
$n$, and the numbers of the density packets for each quantum state depend on
both the principal quantum number $n$ and the secondary quantum number $l$.
When the coupling is not zero,the localized nonlinear matter waves given by the
rational function, their topological properties are independent of the
principal quantum number $n$, only depend on the secondary quantum number $l$.
The Raman detuning and the chemical potential can change the number and the
shape of the density packets. The stability of the Jacobi elliptic solutions
depends on the principal quantum number $n$, while the stability of the
rational solutions depends on the chemical potential and Raman detuning.

decades have seen an increased interest in establishing mathematical results
and developing computational methods for inferring and analyzing these
networks. A salient concept underlying a great majority of these developments
has been the notion that a network displays a set of trees and those trees can
be used to infer, analyze, and study the network.
  In this paper, we show that in the presence of coalescence effects, the set
of displayed trees is not sufficient to capture the network. We formally define
the set of parental trees of a network and make three contributions based on
this definition. First, we extend the notion of anomaly zone to phylogenetic
networks and report on anomaly results for different networks. Second, we
demonstrate how coalescence events could negatively affect the ability to infer
a species tree that could be augmented into the correct network. Third, we
demonstrate how a phylogenetic network can be viewed as a mixture model that
lends itself to a novel inference approach via gene tree clustering.
  Our results demonstrate the limitations of focusing on the set of trees
displayed by a network when analyzing and inferring the network. Our findings
can form the basis for achieving higher accuracy when inferring phylogenetic
networks and open up new venues for research in this area, including new
problem formulations based on the notion of a network's parental trees.

of all the available information, only a small fraction is of users' interest.
To help users catch up with the latest topics of their interests from the large
amount of information available in social media, we present a relevant content
filtering based framework for data stream summarization. More specifically,
given the topic or event of interest, this framework can dynamically discover
and filter out relevant information from irrelevant information in the stream
of text provided by social media platforms. It then further captures the most
representative and up-to-date information to generate a sequential summary or
event story line along with the evolution of the topic or event. Our framework
does not depend on any labeled data, it instead uses the weak supervision
provided by the user, which matches the real scenarios of users searching for
information about an ongoing event. We experimented on two real events traced
by a Twitter dataset from TREC 2011. The results verified the effectiveness of
relevant content filtering and sequential summary generation of the proposed
framework. It also shows its robustness of using the most easy-to-obtain weak
supervision, i.e., trending topic or hashtag. Thus, this framework can be
easily integrated into social media platforms such as Twitter to generate
sequential summaries for the events of interest. We also make the manually
generated gold-standard sequential summaries of the two test events publicly

tool in many areas of condensed-matter physics and materials science, as they
are often used in the study of lattice thermodynamics, solid-solid phase
transitions, magnetic and thermal properties of solids, and fluid mechanics.
However, the problem of finding the global ground state of generalized Ising
model has remained unresolved, with only a limited number of results for simple
systems known. We propose a method to efficiently find the periodic ground
state of a generalized Ising model of arbitrary complexity by a new algorithm
which we term cluster tree optimization. Importantly, we are able to show that
even in the case of an aperiodic ground state, our algorithm produces a
sequence of states with energy converging to the true ground state energy, with
a provable bound on error. Compared to the current state-of-the-art polytope
method, this algorithm eliminates the necessity of introducing an exponential
number of variables to counter frustration, and thus significantly improves
tractability. We believe that the cluster tree algorithm offers an intuitive
and efficient approach to finding and proving ground states of generalized
Ising Hamiltonians of arbitrary complexity, which will help validate
assumptions regarding local vs. global optimality in lattice models, as well as
offer insights into the low-energy behavior of highly frustrated systems.

influences the sizes of protoplanetary discs surrounding young stars.
Particularly so for the short-lived clusters typical for the solar
neighbourhood in which the stellar density and therefore the influence of the
cluster environment changes considerably over the first 10 Myr. In previous
studies often the effect of the gas on the cluster dynamics has been neglected,
this is remedied here. Using the code NBody6++ we study the stellar dynamics in
different developmental phases - embedded, expulsion, expansion - including the
gas and quantify the effect of fly-bys on the disc size. We concentrate on
massive clusters ($M_{\text{cl}} \geq 10^3 - 6 \cdot 10^4 M_{\text{Sun}}$),
which are representative for clusters like the Orion Nebula Cluster (ONC) or
NGC 6611. We find that not only the stellar density but also the duration of
the embedded phase matters. The densest clusters react fastest to the gas
expulsion and drop quickly in density, here 98% of relevant encounters happen
before gas expulsion. By contrast, discs in sparser clusters are initially less
affected but as they expand slower 13% of discs are truncated after gas
expulsion. For ONC-like clusters we find that usually discs larger than 500 AU
are affected by the environment, which corresponds to the observation that 200
AU-sized discs are common. For NGC 6611-like clusters disc sizes are cut-down
on average to roughly 100 AU. A testable hypothesis would be that the discs in
the centre of NGC 6611 should be on average ~20 AU and therefore considerably
smaller than in the ONC.

conjectures concerning the set of gaps between prime numbers G_p , thus
estimating several measures of it. The same procedures are applied to
artificially created number sets, to compare the size of their entropy against
G_p .

the framework of rainbow gravity. By considering rainbow functions in the
metric of Schwarzschild and Reissner-Nordstr\""{o}m black holes, remnant and
critical masses are found to exist. Demanding the universality of logarithmic
corrections to the semi-classical area law for the entropy leads to
constraining the form of the rainbow functions. The mass output and the
radiation rate for these constrained form of rainbow functions have been
computed for different values of the rainbow parameter $\eta$ and have striking
similarity to those derived from the generalized uncertainty principle.

explanations for dark energy or dark matter. An evidence based approach applies
two foundational principles of information theory to show dark energy and dark
matter may be Holographic Dark Information Energy, HDIE. HDIE explains many
effects attributed separately to Lambda and CDM. HDIE mimics Lambda with
sufficient energy and an equation of state parameter, w= -1.03+-0.05 at
redshifts z<1.35 to account for accelerating expansion. HDIE is clumped around
galaxies at densities that distort space-time, explaining many CDM attributed
effects. The present ratio of HDIE:baryons ~2.15, required for observed
expansion history, is equivalent to a dark matter fraction ~68%, consistent
with several galaxy surveys. The HDIE/baryon model is based largely on proven
physics, provides a common explanation for dark energy and dark matter, and
solves the cosmological coincidence problem. At earlier times, z > ~1.35, HDIE
was phantom, w = -1.82+-0.08, enabling the model to be falsified. HDIE fits
Planck dark energy wo-wa plots at least as well as Lambda, and is consistent
with other results that suggest dark energy was phantom at earlier times. A new
w-parameterisation is proposed, as the usual CPL parameterisation is unsuitable
for distinguishing between HDIE/baryon and LambdaCDM models.

model of the subgrid-scale (SGS) stress in large-eddy simulation. ANN is used
to establish a functional relation between the grid-scale (GS) flow field and
the SGS stress without any assumption of the form of function. Data required
for training and test of ANN are provided by direct numerical simulation (DNS)
of a turbulent channel flow. It is shown that ANN can establish a model similar
to the gradient model. The correlation coefficients between the real SGS stress
and the output of ANN are comparable to or larger than similarity models, but
smaller than a two-parameter dynamic mixed model.
