out photometry in the Herschel SPIRE maps at the positions of known sources.
XID+ is developed using a probabilistic Bayesian framework which provides a
natural framework in which to include prior information, and uses the Bayesian
inference tool, Stan, to obtain the full posterior probability distribution on
flux estimates. In this paper, we discuss the details of XID+ and demonstrate
the basic capabilities and performance by running it on simulated SPIRE maps
resembling the COSMOS field, and comparing to the current prior-based source
extraction tool DESPHOT. We show that not only does XID+ perform better on
metrics such as flux accuracy and flux uncertainty accuracy, we illustrate how
obtaining the posterior probability distribution can help overcome some of the
issues inherent with maximum likelihood based source extraction routines. We
run XID+ on the COSMOS SPIRE maps from HerMES, using a 24 $\mathrm{\mu m}$
catalogue as a prior and show the marginalised SPIRE colour-colour plot and
marginalised contribution to the cosmic infrared background at the SPIRE
wavelengths. XID+ is a core tool arising from the Herschel Extragalactic Legacy
Project (HELP) and we discuss how additional work within HELP providing prior
information on fluxes can and will be utilised. The software is available at
https://github.com/H-E-L-P/XID_plus. We also provide the data product for
COSMOS. We believe this is the first time that the full posterior probability
of galaxy photometry has been provided as a data product.

the superflow $\phi_{\mathbb{I}}$ whose group of symmetries is the icosahedral

resulting in an angular asymmetry in the spectrum. We then use the same model
to study the effects of focussing beyond the limit where the paraxial expansion

the shortening of the pulse with focussing. Finally, we study high-intensity

wide range of programming environments. This paper provides an introduction to
the mathematics of the GraphBLAS. Graphs represent connections between vertices
with edges. Matrices can represent a wide range of graphs using adjacency
matrices or incidence matrices. Adjacency matrices are often easier to analyze
while incidence matrices are often better for representing data. Fortunately,
the two are easily connected by matrix mul- tiplication. A key feature of
matrix mathematics is that a very small number of matrix operations can be used
to manipulate a very wide range of graphs. This composability of small number
of operations is the foundation of the GraphBLAS. A standard such as the
GraphBLAS can only be effective if it has low performance overhead. Performance
measurements of prototype GraphBLAS implementations indicate that the overhead
is low.

formalism in a variety of ocean and engineering fluid applications. In a
self-contained way, this study introduces it to the atmospheric dynamical
diagnostics, with important theoretical updates. Multiscale energy equations
are derived using a new analysis apparatus, namely, multiscale window
transform, with respect to both the primitive equation and quasi-geostrophic
models. A reconstruction of the ""atomic"" energy fluxes on the multiple scale
windows allows for a natural and unique separation of the in-scale transports
and cross-scale transfers from the intertwined nonlinear processes. The
resulting energy transfers bear a Lie bracket form, reminiscent of the Poisson
bracket in Hamiltonian mechanics, we hence would call them ""canonical"". A
canonical transfer process is a mere redistribution of energy among scale
windows, without generating or destroying energy as a whole. By classification,
a multiscale energetic cycle comprises of available potential energy (APE)
transport, kinetic energy (KE) transport, pressure work, buoyancy conversion,
work done by external forcing and friction, and the cross-scale canonical
transfers of APE and KE which correspond respectively to the baroclinic and
barotropic instabilities, among others, in geophysical fluid dynamics. A
buoyancy conversion takes place in an individual window only, bridging the two
types of energy namely KE and APE, it does not involve any processes among
different scale windows, and is hence basically not related to instabilities.
This formalism is exemplified with a preliminary application to the
Madden-Julian Oscillation (MJO) study.

virtualization both in the enterprise and high performance computing (HPC). The
startup time of a virtualized environment is a key performance metric for high
performance computing in which the runtime of any individual task is typically
much shorter than the lifetime of a virtualized service in an enterprise
context. In this paper, a methodology for accurately measuring the startup
performance on an HPC system is described. The startup performance overhead of
three of the most mature, widely deployed cloud management frameworks
(OpenStack, OpenNebula, and Eucalyptus) is measured to determine their
suitability for workloads typically seen in an HPC environment. A 10x
performance difference is observed between the fastest (Eucalyptus) and the
slowest (OpenNebula) framework. This time difference is primarily due to delays
in waiting on networking in the cloud-init portion of the startup. The
methodology and measurements presented should facilitate the optimization of
startup across a variety of virtualization environments.

smaller value of the Coulomb matrix element for two of the molecular orbitals

Furthermore, we perform first-principle calculations of the changes in the
electronic structure and in the screened Coulomb matrix elements of A3C60,
brought in by the deformation associated with the pumped T1u intra-molecular

sign and magnitude for superconductivity enhancement. The physical mechanism
responsible for this enhancement consists in a stabilisation of the
intra-molecular states containing a singlet pair, while preserving the orbital
fluctuations allowing for a coherent inter-orbital delocalization of the pair.
Other perturbations have also been considered and found to be detrimental to
superconductivity. The light-induced deformation and ensuing interaction
imbalance is shown to bring superconductivity further into the strong-coupling
regime.

effective properties on a coarse grid by solving local problems and extracting
the average effective properties from these local solutions. In some cases, the
solutions of local problems can be expensive to compute due to scale disparity.
In this setting, one can basically apply a homogenization or multiscale method
re-iteratively to solve for the local problems. This process is known as
re-iterated homogenization and has many variations in the numerical context.
Though the process seems to be a straightforward extension of two-level
process, it requires some careful implementation and the concept development
for problems without scale separation and high contrast. In this paper, we
consider the Generalized Multiscale Finite Element Method (GMsFEM) and apply it
iteratively to construct its multiscale basis functions. The main idea of the
GMsFEM is to construct snapshot functions and then extract multiscale basis
functions (called offline space) using local spectral decompositions in the
snapshot spaces. The extension of this construction to several levels uses
snapshots and offline spaces interchangebly to achieve this goal. At each
coarse-grid scale, we assume that the offline space is a good approximation of
the solution and use all possible offline functions or randomization as
boundary conditions and solve the local problems in the offline space at the
previous (finer) level, to construct snapshot space. We present an adaptivity
strategy and show numerical results for flows in heterogeneous media and in
perforated domains.

share more than 30% sequence identity have similar structures. Below this mark
is the ""twilight zone"" where proteins may have identical or very different

homology modeling. Despite their importance, however, they have never received
a comprehensive biophysical justification. Here we show that the onset of the
twilight zone is more gradual for proteins with low contact density, a proxy
for low thermodynamic stability, than proteins with high contact density. Then
we present an analytical model that treats divergent fold evolution as an
activated process, in analogy to chemical kinetics, where sequence evolution
must overcome thermodynamically unstable evolutionary intermediates to discover
new folds. This model explains the existence of a twilight zone and explains
why its onset is more abrupt for some classes of proteins than for others. We
test the assumptions of the model and characterize the dynamics of fold
evolution using evolutionary simulations of model proteins and cell
populations. Overall these results show how fundamental biophysical constraints

base (KB) by jointly embedding the union of all available schema types---not
only types from multiple structured databases (such as Freebase or Wikipedia
infoboxes), but also types expressed as textual patterns from raw text. This
prediction is typically modeled as a matrix completion problem, with one type
per column, and either one or two entities per row (in the case of entity types
or binary relation types, respectively). Factorizing this sparsely observed
matrix yields a learned vector embedding for each row and each column. In this
paper we explore the problem of making predictions for entities or entity-pairs
unseen at training time (and hence without a pre-learned row embedding). We
propose an approach having no per-row parameters at all; rather we produce a
row vector on the fly using a learned aggregation function of the vectors of
the observed columns for that row. We experiment with various aggregation
functions, including neural network attention models. Our approach can be
understood as a natural language database, in that questions about KB entities
are answered by attending to textual or database evidence. In experiments
predicting both relations and entity types, we demonstrate that despite having
an order of magnitude fewer parameters than traditional universal schema, we
can match the accuracy of the traditional model, and more importantly, we can
now make predictions about unseen rows with nearly the same accuracy as rows
available at training time.

dwarfs. Instead, the star is probably an interloper that is unaffiliated with
the cluster, but younger (< 1 Gyr) than the typical field dwarf. We ruled out a
false positive transit signal produced by confusion with a background eclipsing
binary by adaptive optics imaging and a statistical calculation. Doppler radial
velocity measurements limit the companion mass to <2 times that of Jupiter.
Screening of the lightcurves of 1014 potential Pleiades candidate stars
uncovered no additional planets. An injection-and-recovery experiment using the
K2 Pleiades lightcurves with simulated planets, assuming a planet population
like that in the Kepler prime field, predicts only 0.8-1.8 detections (vs. ~20
in an equivalent Kepler sample). The absence of Pleiades planet detections can
be attributed to the much shorter monitoring time of K2 (80 days vs. 4 years),
increased measurement noise due to spacecraft motion, and the intrinsic
noisiness of the stars.

train iTracker, a convolutional neural network for eye tracking, which achieves
a significant reduction in error over previous approaches while running in real

error of 1.71cm and 2.53cm without calibration on mobile phones and tablets

we demonstrate that the features learned by iTracker generalize well to other

thermal evolution models predict. Although these inflated planets have been
known for over fifteen years, it is unclear whether their inflation is caused
by deposition of energy from the host star, or inhibited cooling of the planet.
These processes can be distinguished if the planet becomes highly irradiated
only when the host star evolves onto the red giant branch. We report the
discovery of K2-97b, a 1.31 $\pm$ 0.11 R$_\mathrm{J}$, 1.10 $\pm$ 0.11
M$_\mathrm{J}$ planet orbiting a 4.20 $\pm$ 0.14 R$_\odot$, 1.16 $\pm$ 0.12
M$_\odot$ red giant star with an orbital period of 8.4 days. We precisely
constrained stellar and planetary parameters by combining asteroseismology,
spectroscopy, and granulation noise modeling along with transit and radial
velocity measurements. The uncertainty in planet radius is dominated by
systematic differences in transit depth, which we measure to be up to 30%
between different lightcurve reduction methods. Our calculations indicate the
incident flux on this planet was 170$^{+140}_{-60}$ times the incident flux on
Earth while the star was on the main sequence. Previous studies suggest that
this incident flux is insufficient to delay planetary cooling enough to explain
the present planet radius. This system thus provides the first evidence that
planets may be inflated directly by incident stellar radiation rather than by
delayed loss of heat from formation. Further studies of planets around red
giant branch stars will confirm or contradict this hypothesis, and may reveal a
new class of re-inflated planets.

result of statistic fluctuations of the composition, x, in the vicinity of the
transition point, where the average gap, E_g, passes through zero. Local gap
follows the fluctuations of x. Using the instanton approach, we show that, near
the gap edges, the tails are exponential, ln N(E) \propto -(E_g-|E|), and the
tail states are due to small gap reduction. Our main finding is that, even when
the smearing magnitude exceeds the gap-width, there exists are semi-hard gap
around zero energy, where ln N(E) \propto -E_g/|E| (ln E_g/|E|). The states
responsible for N(E) originate from local gap reversals within narrow rings.
The consequence of semi-hard gap is the Arrhenius, rather than variable-range
hopping, temperature dependence of the diagonal conductivity at low
temperatures.

suppression of dendrite growth through solid polymer electrolytes (SPE) or

problem. Studies of the mechanical behavior of Li at any length scale and
temperature are virtually non-existent because of its extreme reactivity, which
renders sample preparation, transfer, microstructure characterization and
mechanical testing prohibitively challenging. We conduct nano-mechanical

micron-sized Li attains extremely high strengths of 105 MPa at room temperature

a power-law size-effect at the micron- and sub-micron length scales, with the
strengthening exponent of -0.68 at room temperature and of -1.00 at

theories, which gives rise to the possibilities of healthy non-singular
cosmologies. However, it has been reported that in many cases cosmological
solutions are plagued with instabilities or have some pathologies somewhere in
the whole history of the universe. Recently, this was shown to be generically
true in a certain subclass of the Horndeski theory. In this short paper, we
extend this no-go argument to the full Horndeski theory, and show that
non-singular models (with flat spatial sections) in general suffer either from
gradient instabilities or some kind of pathology in the tensor sector. This
implies that one must go beyond the Horndeski theory to implement healthy
non-singular cosmologies.

event excess around $750 \, \rm GeV$ recently reported by the LHC experiments.
A new strong gauge group is combined with the ordinary color and hypercharge
gauge groups. The VEV responsible for the combination is of the order of the
$SU(2)\times U(1)$ breaking scale, but the coupling of the new physics to
standard model particles is suppressed by the strong interaction of the new
gauge group. This simple extension of the standard model has a rich
phenomenology, including composite particles of the new confining gauge
interaction, a coloron and a $Z'$ which are rather weakly coupled to standard
model particles, and massive vector bosons charged under both the ordinary
color and hypercharge gauge groups and the new strong gauge group. The new
scalar glueball could have mass of around $750 \, \rm GeV$, be produced by
gluon fusion and decay into two photons, both through loops of the new massive
vector bosons. The simplest version of the model has some issues: the massive
vector bosons are stable and the coloron and the $Z'$ are strongly constrained
by search data. An extension of the model to include additional fermions with
the new gauge coupling, though not as simple and elegant, can address both
issues and more. It allows the massive vector boson to decay into a colorless,
neutral state that could be a candidate of the dark matter. And the coloron and
$Z'$ can decay dominantly into the new fermions, completely changing the search
bounds. In addition, $SU(N)$ fermions below the symmetry breaking scale make it
more plausible that the lightest glueball is at $750$~GeV. Whatever becomes of
the $750$~GeV diphoton excess, the model is an unusual example of how new
physics at small scales could be hidden by strong interactions.

asymptotic expansion of the Bergman kernel on the diagonal $$ K_B\sim

locally; e.g., the vanishing of $b\psi_B$ on an open subset of $M$ does not
imply that $M$ is locally spherical there. Nevertheless, the main result in
this paper is that if $D\subset \mathbb C^2$ is assumed to have transverse

branch of research. It is addressed whenever there is a need for reliable,
available, and safe systems. The studies of reliability must be conducted
earlier during the design phase, in order to reduce costs and the number of
prototypes required in the validation of the system. The process of reliability
is then deployed throughout the full cycle of development. This process is
broken down into three major phases: the predictive reliability, the
experimental reliability and operational reliability. The main objective of
this article is a kind of portrayal of the various studies enabling a
noteworthy mastery of the predictive reliability. The weak points are
highlighted. Presenting an overview of all the quantitative and qualitative
approaches concerned with modelling and evaluating the prediction of
reliability is so important for future reliability studies and for academic
research to come up with new methods and tools. The mechatronic system is a
hybrid system, it is dynamic, reconfigurable, and interactive. The modeling
carried out of reliability prediction must take into account these criteria.
Several methodologies have been developed in this track of research. In this
regard, the aforementioned methodologies will be analytically sketched in this
paper.

investigate the effect of scan length on reliability of resting-state
functional connectivity (rsFC) estimates produced from resting-state functional
magnetic resonance imaging (rsfMRI). Additionally, we study the benefits of
empirical Bayes shrinkage, in which subject-level estimates borrow strength
from the population average by trading a small increase in bias for a greater
reduction in variance. For each subject, we compute raw and shrinkage estimates
of rsFC between 300 regions identified through independent components analysis
(ICA) based on rsfMRI scans varying from 3 to 30 minutes in length. The time
course for each region is determined using dual regression, and rsFC is
estimated as the Pearson correlation between each pair of time courses.
Shrinkage estimates for each subject are computed as a weighted average between
the raw subject-level estimate and the population average estimate, where the
weight is determined for each connection by the relationship of within-subject
variance to between-subject variance. We find that shrinkage estimates exhibit
greater reliability than raw estimates for most connections, with 30-40%
improvement using scans less than 10 minutes in length and 10-20% improvement
using scans of 20-30 minutes. We also observe significant spatial variability
in reliability of both raw and shrinkage estimates, with connections within the
default mode and motor networks exhibiting the greatest reliability and
between-network connections exhibiting the poorest reliability. We conclude
that the scan length required for reliable estimation of rsFC depends on the
specific connections of interest, and shrinkage can be used to increase
reliability of rsFC, even when produced from long, high-quality rsfMRI scans.

dimensional Brunn-Minkowski inequality for log-concave measures, which in the
case of Gaussian measure was conjectured by Gardner and Zvavitch \cite{GZ}.
  In this note, we obtain stability results for both Log-Brunn-Minkowski and
dimensional Brunn-Minkowski inequalities for rotation invariant log-conave
measures near a ball. Remarkably, the assumption of symmetry is only necessary
for Log-Brunn-Minkowski stability, which emphasizes an important difference
between the two conjectured inequalities.
  Also, we determine the infinitesimal version of the log-Brunn-Minkowski
inequality. As a consequence, we obtain a strong Poincar\'{e}-type inequality
in the case of unconditional convex sets, as well as for symmetric convex sets
on the plane.
  Additionally, we derive an infinitesimal equivalent version of the

is shown that the total cross section is given by the series of multiple

standard eikonal formulas is that the integrals contain no rapidly oscillating
Bessel functions. Two theorems which allow one to relate large-b behavior of
