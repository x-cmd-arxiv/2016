fact on their way to establish the scaling limits of random P\'{o}lya trees: a
uniform random P\'{o}lya tree of size $n$ consists of a conditioned critical
Galton-Watson tree $C_n$ and many small forests, where with probability tending
to one as $n$ tends to infinity, any forest $F_n(v)$, that is attached to a
node $v$ in $C_n$, is maximally of size $\vert F_n(v)\vert=O(\log n)$. Their
proof used the framework of a Boltzmann sampler and deviation inequalities.
  In this paper, first, we employ a unified framework in analytic combinatorics
to prove this fact with additional improvements on the bound of $\vert
F_n(v)\vert$, namely $\vert F_n(v)\vert=\Theta(\log n)$. Second, we give a
combinatorial interpretation of the rational weights of these forests and the
defining substitution process in terms of automorphisms associated to a given
P\'{o}lya tree. Finally, we derive the limit probability that for a random node
$v$ the attached forest $F_n(v)$ is of a given size.

through the system depending on the loading rate and disorder present in the
failure thresholds of the fibers. In the presence of a quasi-static drive, the
intermittent dynamics of the interface mimic front propagation in disordered

propagation, domain wall dynamics in magnets, charge density waves, contact
line in wetting etc. We study the effect of the range of interaction, i.e. the
neighborhood of the interface affected following a local perturbation, on the
statistics of the intermittent dynamics of the front. There exists a crossover
from local to global behavior as the range of interaction grows and a
continuously varying `universality' in the intermediate range. This means that
the interaction range is a relevant parameter of any resulting physics. This is
particularly relevant in view of the fact that there is a scatter in the
experimental observations of the exponents, in even idealized experiments on
fracture fronts, and also a possibility in changing the interaction range in

a dark matter subhalo, while both orbit a spherical gravitational potential. To
this end, we make use of the simple behaviour of orbits in action-angle space.
A gap effectively results from the divergence of two nearby orbits whose
initial phase-space separation is, for very cold thin streams, largely given by
the impulse induced by the subhalo. We find that in a spherical potential the
size of a gap increases linearly with time for sufficiently long timescales. We
have derived an analytic expression that shows how the growth rate depends on
the mass of the perturbing subhalo, its scale and its relative velocity with
respect to the stream. We have verified these scalings using N-body simulations
and find excellent agreement. For example, a subhalo of mass 10^8 Msun directly
impacting a very cold thin stream on an inclined orbit can induce a gap that
may reach a size of several tens of kpc after a few Gyr. The gap size
fluctuates importantly with phase on the orbit, and it is largest close to
pericentre. This indicates that it may not be fully straightforward to invert
the spectrum of gaps present in a stream to recover the mass spectrum of the
subhalos.

giving rise to a two-Higgs doublet model at low energies. We study the

highly relevant to complex dynamical systems not only in physics, but also in
life-, earth-, and social sciences. It is challenging however to find systems
with sufficiently controllable parameters that allow quantitatively modelling
of emergent properties. Here, we study a non-equilibrium phase transition and
observe signatures of self-organized criticality in a dilute thermal vapour of
atoms optically excited to strongly interacting Rydberg states.
Electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT) provides excellent control over
the population dynamics and enables high-resolution probing of the
driven-dissipative dynamics, which also exhibits phase bistability. Increased
sensitivity compared to previous work allows us to reconstruct the complete
phase diagram including in the vicinity of the critical point. We observe that
interaction-induced energy shifts and enhanced decay only occur in one of the
phases above a critical Rydberg population. This limits the application of
generic mean-field models, however a modified, threshold-dependent approach is
in qualitative agreement with experimental data. Near threshold, we observe
self-organized dynamics in the form of population jumps that return the density
to a critical value.

their approach is more realistic and absence of a detailed mechanism does not
disprove our results. Models can be no better than the information they are

uncertainties, especially in the role of polar stratospheric clouds (PSCs) and
possible interactions with cosmic rays that constitute lower boundary
conditions. Duderstadt et al. [2014; 2016a] used incomplete, poorly-constrained

our calculated nitrate enhancement is consistent with measured results, given
current levels of uncertainty, and that extreme SPEs can potentially produce
occasional nitrate spikes with hundreds of percent increases. Instead of
repeating old arguments to dismiss nitrates as proxies of SPEs, it is past time
for a dedicated, fine-resolution, multi-parameter, replicate ice core field

Fortunately, vacuum fluctuations are not immutable, and can be ""squeezed""

experimentally demonstrate that squeezed light can be used to sideband cool the
motion of a macroscopic mechanical object below the quantum limit. To do so, we
first cool a microwave cavity optomechanical system with a coherent state of

quantum limit using a squeezed microwave field generated by a Josephson
Parametric Amplifier (JPA). From heterodyne spectroscopy of the mechanical
sidebands, we measure a minimum thermal occupancy of 0.19 phonons. With this
novel technique, even low frequency mechanical oscillators can in principle be
cooled arbitrarily close to the motional ground state, enabling the exploration

Characteristics of that process determined by the harmonic trapping, the decay

the literature, cosine based random quantization has attracted much attentions
due to its intrinsic bounded results. Nevertheless, it usually suffers from the
uncertain outputs, and information of original data fails to be fully preserved

adaptive training quantization (ATQ), is proposed to learn the ideal transform
of random encoder, where the limitation of cosine random mapping is tackled. As
an adaptive learning idea, the reduced mapping is adaptively calculated with
idea of data group, while the bias of random transform is to be improved to
hold most matching information. Experimental results show that the proposed

weighted completion time on unrelated machines when jobs have release times,
i.e, $R | r_{ij} | \sum_j w_j C_j$ using the three-field notation. For this
problem, a 2-approximation is known based on a novel convex programming (J. ACM
2001 by Skutella). It has been a long standing open problem if one can improve
upon this 2-approximation (Open Problem 8 in J. of Sched. 1999 by Schuurman and
Woeginger). We answer this question in the affirmative by giving a
1.8786-approximation. We achieve this via a surprisingly simple linear
programming, but a novel rounding algorithm and analysis. A key ingredient of
our algorithm is the use of random offsets sampled from non-uniform
distributions.
  We also consider the preemptive version of the problem, i.e, $R | r_{ij},pmtn
| \sum_j w_j C_j$. We again use the idea of sampling offsets from non-uniform
distributions to give the first better than 2-approximation for this problem.
This improvement also requires use of a configuration LP with variables for
each job's complete schedules along with more careful analysis. For both
non-preemptive and preemptive versions, we break the approximation barrier of 2
for the first time.

presented. Starting from the original work of Mahaux and Sartor, several
necessary steps are developed and illustrated which increase the scope of the
DOM allowing its interpretation as generating an experimentally constrained
functional form of the nucleon self-energy. The method could therefore be
renamed as the dispersive self-energy method.
  The aforementioned steps include the introduction of simultaneous fits of
data for chains of isotopes or isotones allowing a data-driven extrapolation
for the prediction of scattering cross sections and level properties in the
direction of the respective drip lines. In addition, the energy domain for data
was enlarged to include results up to 200 MeV where available. An important
application of this work was implemented by employing these DOM potentials to
the analysis of the (\textit{d,p}) transfer reaction using the adiabatic
distorted wave approximation (ADWA).
  We review the fully non-local DOM potential fitted to ${}^{40}$Ca where
elastic-scattering data, level information, particle number, charge density and
high-momentum-removal $(e,e'p)$ cross sections obtained at Jefferson Lab were
included in the analysis. An important consequence of this new analysis is the
finding that the spectroscopic factor for the removal of valence protons in
this nucleus comes out larger by about 0.15 than the results obtained from the
NIKHEF analysis of their $(e,e'p)$ data. Another important consequence of this
analysis is that it can shed light on the relative importance of two-body and
three-body interactions as far as their contribution to the energy of the
ground state is concerned through application of the energy sum rule.

close surroundings of a two-dimensional flux slab ""pump"" the plasma inside it
in the downward direction. This action produces a downflow inside the flux
slab, which encompasses ever higher layers, causing an upwardly propagating
rarefaction wave. The slow mode, excited by the adiabatic compression of the
downflow near the optical surface, travels along the magnetic field in the
upward direction at the tube speed. It develops into a shock wave at
chromospheric heights, where it dissipates, lifts the transition region, and
produces an offspring in the form of a compressive wave that propagates further
into the corona. In the wake of downflows and propagating shock waves, the
atmosphere inside the flux slab in the chromosphere and higher tends to
oscillate with a period of $\nu\approx 4$~mHz. We conclude that this process of
""magnetic pumping"" is a most plausible mechanism for the direct generation of
longitudinal chromospheric and coronal compressive waves within magnetic flux
concentrations, and it may provide an important heat source in the

nuclear magnetic resonance to the single spin level. For optical detection it
has essentially become routine to observe a single electron spin or nuclear
spin. Typically, the systems in use are carefully designed to allow for single
spin detection and manipulation, and of those systems, diamond spin defects
rank very high, being so robust that they can be addressed, read out and
coherently controlled even under ambient conditions and in a versatile set of
nanostructures. This renders them as a new type of sensor, which has been shown
to detect single electron and nuclear spins among other quantities like force,
pressure and temperature. Adapting pulse sequences from classic NMR and EPR,
and combined with high resolution optical microscopy, proximity to the target
sample and nanoscale size, the diamond sensors have the potential to constitute
a new class of magnetic resonance detectors with single spin sensitivity. As
diamond sensors can be operated under ambient conditions, they offer potential
application across a multitude of disciplines. Here we review the different
existing techniques for magnetic resonance, with a focus on diamond defect spin
sensors, showing their potential as versatile sensors for ultra-sensitive
magnetic resonance with nanoscale spatial resolution.

elucidate the connections of these different fields on the basis of the

pairwise comparisons. Items are ranked according to the probability that a
given item beats a randomly chosen item, and ranking refers to partitioning the
items into sets of pre-specified sizes according to their scores. This notion
of ranking includes as special cases the identification of the top-k items and
the total ordering of the items. We first analyze a sequential ranking
algorithm that counts the number of comparisons won, and uses these counts to
decide whether to stop, or to compare another pair of items, chosen based on
confidence intervals specified by the data collected up to that point. We prove
that this algorithm succeeds in recovering the ranking using a number of
comparisons that is optimal up to logarithmic factors. This guarantee does not
require any structural properties of the underlying pairwise probability
matrix, unlike a significant body of past work on pairwise ranking based on
parametric models such as the Thurstone or Bradley-Terry-Luce models. It has
been a long-standing open question as to whether or not imposing these
parametric assumptions allows for improved ranking algorithms. For stochastic
comparison models, in which the pairwise probabilities are bounded away from
zero, our second contribution is to resolve this issue by proving a lower bound
for parametric models. This shows, perhaps surprisingly, that these popular
parametric modeling choices offer at most logarithmic gains for stochastic
comparisons.

can be applied to measure the SFR in real regions throughout the Milky Way. We
investigate diffuse infrared SFR tracers such as those using 24 {\mu}m, 70
{\mu}m and total infrared emission, which have been previously calibrated for
global galaxy scales. We set up a toy model of a galaxy and show that the
infrared emission is consistent with the intrinsic SFR using extra-galactic
calibrated laws (although the consistency does not prove their reliability).
For local scales, we show that these techniques produce completely unreliable
results for single star-forming regions, which are governed by different
characteristic timescales. We show how calibration of these techniques can be
improved for single star-forming regions by adjusting the characteristic
timescale and the scaling factor and give suggestions of new calibrations of
the diffuse star-formation tracers. We show that star-forming regions that are
dominated by high-mass stellar feedback experience a rapid drop in infrared
emission once high-mass stellar feedback is turned on, which implies different
characteristic timescales. Moreover, we explore the measured SFRs calculated
directly from the observed young stellar population. We find that the measured
point sources follow the evolutionary pace of star formation more directly than
diffuse star-formation tracers.

Survey (DNGS). The survey consists of wide field, deep ($\mu_{g} > 31$ mag
arcsec$^{-2}$) optical imaging of nearby galaxies using the Dragonfly Telephoto
Array. Our sample includes eight spiral galaxies with stellar masses similar to
that of the Milky Way, inclinations of $16-90$ degrees and distances between
$7-18$ Mpc. We construct stellar mass surface density profiles from the
observed $g$-band surface brightness in combination with the $g-r$ color as a
function of radius, and compute the halo fractions from the excess stellar mass
(relative to a disk$+$bulge fit) beyond $5$ half-mass radii. We find a mean
halo fraction of $0.009 \pm 0.005$ and a large RMS scatter of
$1.01^{+0.9}_{-0.26}$ dex. The peak-to-peak scatter is a factor of $>100$ --
while some galaxies feature strongly structured halos resembling that of M31,
three of the eight have halos that are completely undetected in our data. We
conclude that spiral galaxies as a class exhibit a rich variety in stellar halo
properties, implying that their assembly histories have been highly

susceptible to biases that might affect the observed strength of the relation

diagnostics, the anti-correlation with SFR is stronger for the relatively few
galaxies whose current SFRs are elevated above their past average SFRs. This is
also true for the new abundance diagnostic of Dopita et al. (2016), which gives
anti-correlation between metallicity and SFR only in the high specific star
formation rate (sSFR) regime, in contrast to the recent results of Kashino et

mass, metallicity, and SFR must be carefully accounted for in theoretical

formation activity---it contains no confirmed protostars. HCO+, HCN, and N2H+

widespread, and molecular emission seen toward 90% of the area above N(H_2)
column densities of 1.9x10^21 cm^-2. HCO+ has the broadest velocity dispersion,
near 0.3 km/s on average, compared to ~0.15 km/s for the other molecules, thus
representing a range from supersonic to subsonic gas motions. Our non-binary
dendrogram analysis reveals that the dense gas traced by each molecule has
similar hierarchical structure, and that gas surrounding the candidate first
hydrostatic core (FHSC), L1451-mm, and other previously detected single-dish
continuum clumps have similar hierarchical structure; this suggests that
different sub-regions of L1451 are fragmenting on the pathway to forming young
stars. We determined the three-dimensional morphology of the largest detectable
dense gas structures to be relatively ellipsoidal compared to other CLASSy
regions, which appeared more flattened at largest scales. A virial analysis
shows the most centrally condensed dust structures are likely unstable against
collapse. Additionally, we identify a new spherical, centrally condensed N2H+
feature that could be a new FHSC candidate. The overall results suggest L1451
is a young region starting to form its generation of stars within turbulent,
hierarchical structures.

extended mean-field approximation, where vacuum quark fluctuations are
included. At a given cutoff scale the model parameters are fixed by fitting
vacuum quantities, typically including the sigma-meson mass $m_\sigma$ and the
pion decay constant $f_\pi$. In most publications the latter is identified with
the expectation value of the sigma field, while for $m_\sigma$ the curvature
mass is taken. When quark loops are included, this prescription is however
inconsistent, and the correct identification involves the renormalized pion
decay constant and the sigma pole mass. In the present article we investigate
the influence of the parameter-fixing scheme on the phase structure of the
model at finite temperature and chemical potential. Despite large differences
between the model parameters in the two schemes, we find that in homogeneous
matter the effect on the phase diagram is relatively small. For inhomogeneous
phases, on the other hand, the choice of the proper renormalization
prescription is crucial. In particular, we show that if renormalization effects
on the pion decay constant are not considered, the model does not even present
a well-defined renormalized limit when the cutoff is sent to infinity.

are found by maximizing a log-likelihood function based on single order
statistics after transforming through a sequence of trial cumulative
distribution functions that iteratively improve using a Monte Carlo random
search method. Improvement is quantified by assessing the random variables
against the statistical properties of sampled uniform random data. Quality is
determined using an empirically derived scoring function that is scaled to be
sample size invariant. The scoring function identifies atypical fluctuations,
for which threshold values are set to define objective criteria that prevent
under-fitting as trial iterations continue to improve the model pdf, and,
stopping the iteration cycle before over-fitting occurs. No prior knowledge
about the data is required. An ensemble of pdf models is used to reflect
uncertainties due to statistical fluctuations in random samples, and the
quality of the estimates is visualized using scaled residual quantile plots
that show deviations from size-invariant statistics. These considerations
result in a tractable method that holistically employs key principles of random
variables and their statistical properties combined with employing orthogonal
basis functions and data-driven adaptive algorithms. Benchmark tests show that
the pdf estimates readily converge to the true pdf as sample size increases.
Robust results are demonstrated on several test probability densities that

physics in a (400 Mpc/h)^3 volume with 0.7 trillion particles to follow the
earliest phases of black hole critical growth. At z=8 the most massive black
holes (a handful) approach masses of 10^8 Msun with the most massive (with M_BH

galaxy. Examining the large-scale environment of hosts, we find that the
initial tidal field is more important than overdensity in setting the
conditions for early BH growth. In regions of low tidal fields gas accretes
'cold' onto the black hole and falls along thin, radial filaments straight into
the center forming the most compact galaxies and most massive black holes at
earliest times. Regions of high tidal fields instead induce larger coherent
angular momenta and influence the formation of the first population of massive
compact disks. The extreme early growth depends on the early interplay of high
gas densities and the tidal field that shapes the mode of accretion. Mergers
play a minor role in the formation of the first generation, rare massive BHs.

The most fundamental predictions of GR are black holes (BHs), but in spite of
many convincing BH candidates in the Universe, there is no conclusive
experimental proof of their existence using astronomical observations in the
electromagnetic spectrum. Are BHs real astrophysical objects? Does GR hold in
its most extreme limit or are alternatives needed? The prime target to address
these fundamental questions is in the center of our own Galaxy, which hosts the
closest and best-constrained supermassive BH candidate in the Universe,
Sagittarius A* (Sgr A*). Three different types of experiments hold the promise
to test GR in a strong-field regime using observations of Sgr A* with
new-generation instruments. The first experiment aims to image the relativistic
plasma emission which surrounds the event horizon and forms a ""shadow"" cast
against the background, whose predicted size (~50 microarcseconds) can now be
resolved by upcoming VLBI experiments at mm-waves such as the Event Horizon
Telescope (EHT). The second experiment aims to monitor stars orbiting Sgr A*
with the upcoming near-infrared interferometer GRAVITY at the Very Large
Telescope (VLT). The third experiment aims to time a radio pulsar in tight
orbit about Sgr A* using radio telescopes (including the Atacama Large
Millimeter Array or ALMA). The BlackHoleCam project exploits the synergy
between these three different techniques and aims to measure the main BH
parameters with sufficient precision to provide fundamental tests of GR and
probe the spacetime around a BH in any metric theory of gravity. Here, we
review our current knowledge of the physical properties of Sgr A* as well as
the current status of such experimental efforts towards imaging the event
horizon, measuring stellar orbits, and timing pulsars around Sgr A*.

data re-organization of a tetrahedral data-parallel domain of size
$\mathcal{O}(n^3)$ combined with an efficient block-space GPU map of the form
$g:\mathbb{N} \rightarrow \mathbb{N}^3$. Results from the analysis suggest that
in theory the combination of these two optimizations produce significant
performance improvement as block-based data re-organization allows a coalesced
one-to-one correspondence at local thread-space while $g(\lambda)$ produces an
efficient block-space spatial correspondence between groups of data and groups
of threads, reducing the number of unnecessary threads from $O(n^3)$ to
$O(n^2\rho^3)$ where $\rho$ is the linear block-size and typically $\rho^3 \ll
n$. From the analysis, we obtained that a block based succint data
re-organization can provide up to $2\times$ improved performance over a linear
data organization while the map can be up to $6\times$ more efficient than a
bounding box approach. The results from this work can serve as a useful guide
for a more efficient GPU computation on tetrahedral domains found in spin
lattice, finite element and special n-body problems, among others.

systems. In large scale-out data architectures, data are distributed and
replicated across several machines. Queries/tasks to such data architectures,
are sent to a router which determines the machines containing the requested
data. Ideally, to reduce the overall cost of analytics, the smallest set of
machines required to satisfy the query should be returned by the router.
Mathematically, this can be modeled as the set cover problem, which is NP-hard,
thus making the routing process a balance between optimality and performance.
Even though an efficient greedy approximation algorithm for routing a single
query exists, there is currently no better method for processing multiple
queries than running the greedy set cover algorithm repeatedly for each query.
This method is impractical for Big Data systems and the state-of-the-art
techniques route a query to all machines and choose as a cover the machines
that respond fastest. In this paper, we propose an efficient technique to
speedup the routing of a large number of real-time queries while minimizing the
number of machines that each query touches (query span). We demonstrate that by
analyzing the correlation between known queries and performing query
clustering, we can reduce the set cover computation time, thereby significantly
speeding up routing of unknown queries. Experiments show that our incremental
set cover-based routing is 2.5 times faster and can return on average 50% fewer

routing techniques.

explicit, tractable model for these interactions is still lacking. Here we
build a probabilistic model of population activity that reproduces the firing
rate of each cell, the distribution of the population rate, and the linear
coupling between them. This model is tractable, meaning that its parameters can
be learned in a few seconds on a standard computer even for large population
recordings. We inferred our model for a population of 160 neurons in the
salamander retina. In this population, single-cell firing rates depended in
unexpected ways on the population rate. In particular, some cells had a
preferred population rate at which they were most likely to fire. These complex
dependencies could not be explained by a linear coupling between the cell and
the population rate. We designed a more general, still tractable model that
could fully account for these non-linear dependencies. We thus provide a simple

$\nu_{\mu}A\rightarrow\mu^{-}K^{+}A$, is a rare, inelastic electroweak process
that brings a $K^+$ on shell and leaves the target nucleus intact in its ground
state. This process is significantly lower in rate than neutrino-induced
charged-current coherent pion production, because of Cabibbo suppression and a
kinematic suppression due to the larger kaon mass. We search for such events in
the scintillator tracker of MINERvA by observing the final state $K^+$, $\mu^-$
and no other detector activity, and by using the kinematics of the final state
particles to reconstruct the small momentum transfer to the nucleus, which is a
model-independent characteristic of coherent scattering. We find the first
experimental evidence for the process at $3\sigma$ significance.

in the early universe in the presence of a hypermagnetic field with varying
helicity. We investigate whether the matter / anti-matter asymmetry of the
universe can be created from the decaying helicity of a primordial
(hyper)magnetic field before and after the electroweak phase transition. In
this model, baryogenesis occurs without $(B-L)$-violation, since the $(B+L)$
asymmetry generated by the hypermagnetic field counteracts the washout by
electroweak sphalerons. At the electroweak crossover, the hypermagnetic field
becomes an electromagnetic field, which does not source $(B+L)$. Although the
sphalerons remain in equilibrium for a time, washout is avoided since the
decaying magnetic helicity sources chirality. The relic baryon asymmetry is
fixed when the electroweak sphaleron freezes out. Under reasonable assumptions,
a baryon asymmetry of $n_B / s \simeq 4 \times 10^{-12}$ can be generated from
a maximally helical, right-handed (hyper)magnetic field that has a field
strength of $B_0 \simeq 10^{-14} \, {\rm Gauss}$ and coherence length of
$\lambda_{0} \simeq 1 \, {\rm pc}$ today. Relaxing an assumption that relates
$\lambda_0$ to $B_0$, the model predicts $n_B / s \gtrsim 10^{-10}$, which
could potentially explain the observed baryon asymmetry of the universe.

interested in describing the anthropogenic influence on extreme weather events,
commonly termed ""event attribution."" Limitations in the observational record
and in computational resources motivate the use of uncoupled,
atmosphere/land-only climate models with prescribed ocean conditions run over a
short period, leading up to and including an event of interest. In this
approach, large ensembles of high-resolution simulations can be generated under
factual observed conditions and counterfactual conditions that might have been
observed in the absence of human interference; these can be used to estimate
the change in probability of the given event due to anthropogenic influence.
However, using a prescribed ocean state ignores the possibility that estimates
of attributable risk might be a function of the ocean state. Thus, the
uncertainty in attributable risk is likely underestimated, implying an
over-confidence in anthropogenic influence.
  In this work, we estimate the year-to-year variability in calculations of the
anthropogenic contribution to extreme weather based on large ensembles of
atmospheric model simulations. Our results both quantify the magnitude of
year-to-year variability and categorize the degree to which conclusions of
attributable risk are qualitatively affected. The methodology is illustrated by
exploring extreme temperature and precipitation events for the northwest coast
of South America and northern-central Siberia; we also provides results for
regions around the globe. While it remains preferable to perform a full
multi-year analysis, the results presented here can serve as an indication of
where and when attribution researchers should be concerned about the use of
atmosphere-only simulations.

integrable systems. The formalism presented generalizes an approach by Yudson
and is applied to Lieb-Liniger model which describes a gas of $N$ interacting
bosons moving on the continuous infinite line while interacting via a short
range potential. We carry out the quench from several initial states and for
any number of particles and compute the evolution of the density and the noise
correlations. In the long time limit the system dilutes and we find that for
any value of repulsive coupling independently of the initial state the system
asymptotes towards astrongly repulsive gas, while for any value of attractive
coupling, the system forms a maximal bound state that dominates at longer
times. In either case the system equilibrates but does not thermalize, an
effect that is consistent with prethermalization. These results can be
confronted with experiments. For much more detail see: Phys. Rev. A 87, 053628

the Heisenberg model and to the Anderson model will be presented elsewhere.

on this result, an exact asymptotic lower bound on the minimax EER is provided.
This bound is of the simple form $c_\infty/\sqrt{\nu}$ as $\nu\to\infty$, where
$c_\infty=0.16997\dots$ is a universal constant, $\nu=m/d$, $m$ is the size of
the training sample, and $d$ is the Vapnik--Chervonenkis dimension of the

the maximum EER of any learning algorithms that minimize the empirical risk,
are asymptotically negligible, and all these differences are due to ties in the

bounds on the minimax EER are also obtained, which are shown to be close to the

produced by Galactic dust, lensing of primordial E-modes in the cosmic
microwave background (CMB) by intervening large scale structure, and possibly
by primordial B-modes in the CMB imprinted by gravitational waves produced
during inflation. The conventional method used to separate the dust component
of the signal is to assume that the signal at high frequencies (e.g., 350 GHz)
is due solely to dust and then extrapolate the signal down to lower frequency
(e.g., 150 GHz) using the measured scaling of the polarized dust signal
amplitude with frequency. For typical Galactic thermal dust temperatures of
about 20K, these frequencies are not fully in the Rayleigh-Jeans limit.
Therefore, deviations in the dust cloud temperatures from cloud to cloud will
lead to different scaling factors for clouds of different temperatures. Hence,
when multiple clouds of different temperatures and polarization angles
contribute to the integrated line-of-sight polarization signal, the relative
contribution of individual clouds to the integrated signal can change between
frequencies. This can cause the integrated signal to be decorrelated in both
amplitude and direction when extrapolating in frequency. Here we carry out a
Monte Carlo analysis on the impact of this line-of-sight extrapolation noise,
enabling us to quantify its effect. Using results from the Planck experiment,
we find that this effect is small, more than an order of magnitude smaller than
the current uncertainties. However, line-of-sight extrapolation noise may be a
significant source of uncertainty in future low-noise primordial B-mode
experiments. Scaling from Planck results, we find that accounting for this
uncertainty becomes potentially important when experiments are sensitive to
primordial B-mode signals with amplitude r < 0.0015 .

variable component and a sparse graphical component. Our study is motivated by
analysis of item response data in cognitive assessment and has applications to
many disciplines where item response data are collected. Standard approaches to
item response data in cognitive assessment adopt the multidimensional item
response theory (IRT) models. However, human cognition is typically a
complicated process and thus may not be adequately described by just a few
factors. Consequently, a low-dimensional latent factor model, such as the
multidimensional IRT models, is often insufficient to capture the structure of
the data. The proposed model adds a sparse graphical component that captures
the remaining ad hoc dependence. It reduces to a multidimensional IRT model
when the graphical component becomes degenerate. Model selection and parameter
estimation are carried out simultaneously through construction of a
pseudo-likelihood function and properly chosen penalty terms. The convexity of
the pseudo-likelihood function allows us to develop an efficient algorithm,
while the penalty terms generate a low-dimensional latent component and a
sparse graphical structure. Desirable theoretical properties are established
under suitable regularity conditions. The method is applied to the revised
Eysenck's personality questionnaire, revealing its usefulness in item analysis.
Simulation results are reported that show the new method works well in
practical situations.

based on an individual network. However, nowadays users often join several OSNs

Therefore, in order to obtain the best set of seed users, it is crucial to
consider the role of overlapping users under this circumstances.

demonstrate that subgraph vectors learnt by our approach could be used in
conjunction with classifiers such as CNNs, SVMs and relational data clustering
algorithms to achieve significantly superior accuracies. Also, we show that the
subgraph vectors could be used for building a deep learning variant of
Weisfeiler-Lehman graph kernel. Our experiments on several benchmark and
large-scale real-world datasets reveal that subgraph2vec achieves significant
improvements in accuracies over existing graph kernels on both supervised and
unsupervised learning tasks. Specifically, on two realworld program analysis
tasks, namely, code clone and malware detection, subgraph2vec outperforms
state-of-the-art kernels by more than 17% and 4%, respectively.

  with an optical parametric amplifier","19 pages, 5 figures",,,,"quant-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We propose a scheme to modulate the entanglement between two oscillators
separated in space via the squeezing cavity field generated by the optical
parametric amplifier instead of injecting the squeezing field directly with the
assistance of Coulomb interaction. We show that the Coulomb interaction between
the oscillators is the essential reason for the existence of entanglement. Due
to the gain of the optical parametric amplifier and the phase of the pump
driving the optical parametric amplifier can simultaneously modulate the
squeezing cavity field, the radiation pressure interaction between the cavity
field and the oscillator is modulated accordingly. We find that there is
competing effect between the radiation pressure interaction and the Coulomb
interaction for the oscillator which these two interactions act on
simultaneously. Therefore, the modulation of entanglement can be achieved with
the assistance of Coulomb interaction. The results of numerical simulation show
that the present scheme has stronger robustness against the temperature of

clear separation between \CR\ and \ch\ sub-types. The \CR\ and \ch\ stars seem
to smoothly transition from one to another. This may hint that the \CR\ and
\ch\ stars may not be different in their origins but look different in their

For optimizing data delivery ratio and reducing redundant data a lot of data
forwarding schemes, which selectively replicate data to encountered
participants through node's data forwarding metric are proposed. However most
of them neglect a kind of redundant data whose Time-To-Live is expired. For
reducing this kind of redundant data we proposed a new method to evaluate
node's data forwarding metric, which is used to measure the node's probability
of forwarding data to destination within data's constraint time. The method is
divided into two parts. The first is evaluating nodes whether have possibility
to contact destination within time constraint based on transient cluster. We
propose a method to detect node's transient cluster, which is based on node's
contact rate. Only node, which has possibility to contact destination, has
chances to the second step. It effectively reduces the computational
complexity. The second is calculating data forwarding probability of node to
destination according to individual ICT (inter contact time) distribution.
Evaluation results show that our proposed transient cluster detection method is
more simple and quick. And from two aspects of data delivery ratio and network
overhead our approach outperforms other existing data forwarding approach.

progenitor supernova and study the environment in which the SNR evolved. The
X-ray morphology of the remnant displays a non-uniform structure of
semi-circular appearance, with a bright southwest region and very weak or
almost negligible X-ray emission in its northern part. These results indicate
that the remnant is propagating in a non-uniform environment as the shock
fronts are encountering a high-density medium, where enhanced infrared emission
is detected. The X-ray spectral analysis of the selected regions shows distinct
emission-line features of several metal elements, confirming the thermal origin
of the emission. The X-ray spectra are well represented by a combination of two
absorbed thermal plasma models: one in equilibrium ionization with a mean
temperature of ~0.19 keV, and another out of equilibrium ionization at a higher
temperature of ~1.1 or 1.6-1.9 keV. For regions located in the northeast,
central, and southwest part of the SNR, we found elevated abundances of Si, S,
Ar, Ca, and Fe, typical of ejecta material. The outer regions located northwest
and south show values of the abundances above solar but lower than to those
found in the central regions. This suggests that the composition of the
emitting outer parts of the SNR is a combination of ejecta and shocked material
of the interstellar medium. The comparison between the S/Si, Ar/Si, and Ca/Si
abundances ratios (1.75, 1.27, and 2.72 in the central region, respectively),
favor a Type Ia progenitor for this SNR, a result that is also supported by an
independent morphological analysis using X-ray and IR data.

test single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) with extremely small minor allele
frequency (MAF). Various rare variant tests were proposed to increase power by
aggregating SNPs within a fixed genomic region, such as a gene or pathway.
However, a gene could contain from several to thousands of markers, and not all
of them may be related to the phenotype. Combining functional and
non-functional SNPs in arbitrary genomic region could impair the testing power.
Results: We propose a Zoom-Focus algorithm (ZFA) to locate the optimal testing
region within a given genomic region, as a wrapper function to be applied in
conjunction with rare variant association tests. In the first Zooming step, a
given genomic region is partitioned by order of two, and the best partition is
located within all partition levels. In the next Focusing step, boundaries of
the zoomed region are refined. Simulation studies showed that ZFA substantially
enhanced the statistical power of rare variant tests by over 10 folds,
including the WSS, SKAT and W-test. The algorithm is applied on real exome
sequencing data of hypertensive disorder, and identified biologically relevant
genetic markers to metabolic disorder that are undiscoverable by testing using
full gene. The proposed algorithm is an efficient and powerful tool to increase
the effectiveness of rare variant association tests for exome sequencing
datasets of complex disorder.

particular disease, or likelihood of smoking) is challenging for a variety of
reasons. For one, `local' features (such as an individual's demographic
information) may lack sufficient information to make informative predictions;
this is especially problematic when predicting `risk,' as the relevant features
may be precisely those that an individual is disinclined to reveal in a survey.
Secondly, even if such features are available, they still may miss crucial
information, as `risk' may be a function not just of an individual's features
but also those of their friends and social communities. Here, we predict
individual's risk profiles as a function of both their local features and those
of their friends. Instead of modeling influence from the social network
directly (which proved difficult as friendship links may be sparse and
partially observed), we instead model influence by discovering social
communities in the network that may be related to risky behavior. The result is
a model that predicts risk as a function of local features, while making up for
their deficiencies and accounting for social influence by uncovering community
structure in the network. We test our model by predicting risky behavior among
adolescents from the Add health data set, and hometowns among users in a
Facebook ego net. Compared to prediction by features alone, our model
demonstrates better predictive accuracy when measured as a whole, and in

address computation scheme that flows an already incurred error is better than
a scheme that corrupts one particular array access but otherwise (falsely)
appears to compute perfectly. Enabling the flow of errors allows one to situate
detectors at loop exit points, and helps turn silent corruptions into easily

  with network coding","submitted for possible publication",,"10.1109/TSP.2017.2649486",,"cs.IT math.IT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  There are two fundamentally different fronthaul techniques in the downlink
communication of cloud radio access network (C-RAN): the data-sharing strategy
and the compression-based strategy. Under the former strategy, each user's
message is multicast from the central processor (CP) to all the serving remote
radio heads (RRHs) over the fronthaul network, which then cooperatively serve
the users through joint beamforming; while under the latter strategy, the user
messages are first beamformed then quantized at the CP, and the compressed
signal is unicast to the corresponding RRH, which then decompresses its
received signal for wireless transmission. Previous works show that in general
the compression-based strategy outperforms the data-sharing strategy. This
paper, on the other hand, point s out that in a C-RAN model where the RRHs are
connected to the CP via multi-hop routers, data-sharing can be superior to
compression if the network coding technique is adopted for multicasting user
messages to the cooperating RRHs, and the RRH's beamforming vectors, the
user-RRH association, and the network coding design over the fronthaul network
are jointly optimized based on the techniques of sparse optimization an d
successive convex approximation. This is in comparison to the compression-based
strategy, where information is unicast over the fronthaul network by simple
routing, and the RRH's compression noise covariance and beamforming vectors, as
well as the routing strategy over the fronthaul network are jointly optimized
based on the successive convex approximation technique. The observed gain in
overall network throughput is due to that information multicast is more
efficient than information unicast over the multi-hop fronthaul of a C-RAN.

  programs",,,,,"math.OC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In this paper, we study the strength of Chvatal-Gomory (CG) cuts and more
generally aggregation cuts for packing and covering integer programs (IPs).
Aggregation cuts are obtained as follows: Given an IP formulation, we first
generate a single implied inequality using aggregation of the original
constraints, then obtain the integer hull of the set defined by this single
inequality with variable bounds, and finally use the inequalities describing
the integer hull as cutting-planes. Our first main result is to show that for
packing and covering IPs, the CG and aggregation closures can be 2-approximated
by simply generating the respective closures for each of the original
formulation constraints, without using any aggregations. On the other hand, we
use computational experiments to show that aggregation cuts can be arbitrarily
stronger than cuts from individual constraints for general IPs. The proof of
the above stated results for the case of covering IPs with bounds require the
development of some new structural results, which may be of independent
interest. Finally, we examine the strength of cuts based on k different
aggregation inequalities simultaneously, the so-called multi-row cuts, and show
that every packing or covering IP with a large integrality gap also has a large
k-aggregation closure rank. In particular, this rank is always at least of the
order of the logarithm of the integrality gap.

and $\mathrm{wcol}_r(G)$ were introduced by Kierstead and Yang as
generalisations of the usual colouring number, also known as the degeneracy of
a graph, and have since then found important applications in the theory of
bounded expansion and nowhere dense classes of graphs, introduced by
Ne\v{s}et\v{r}il and Ossona de Mendez. In this paper, we study the relation of
the colouring numbers with two other measures that characterise nowhere dense
classes of graphs, namely with uniform quasi-wideness, studied first by Dawar
et al. in the context of preservation theorems for first-order logic, and with
the splitter game, introduced by Grohe et al. We show that every graph
excluding a fixed topological minor admits a universal order, that is, one
order witnessing that the colouring numbers are small for every value of $r$.
Finally, we use our construction of such orders to give a new proof of a result
of Eickmeyer and Kawarabayashi, showing that the model-checking problem for
successor-invariant first-order formulas is fixed-parameter tractable on
classes of graphs with excluded topological minors.

with a finite battery. Contrary to traditional communication systems, the
transmitter of such a channel is powered by a device that harvests energy from
a random exogenous energy source and has a finite-sized battery. As a
consequence, at each transmission opportunity the system can only transmit a
symbol whose energy is no more than the energy currently available. This new
type of power supply introduces an unprecedented input constraint for the
channel, which is simultaneously random, instantaneous, and influenced by the
full history of the inputs and the energy harvesting process. Furthermore,
naturally, in such a channel the energy information is observed causally at the
transmitter. Both of these characteristics pose great challenges for the
analysis of the channel capacity. In this work we use techniques developed for
channels with side information and finite state channels, to obtain lower and
upper bounds on the capacity of energy harvesting channels. In particular, in a
general case with Markov energy harvesting processes we use stationarity and
ergodicity theory to compute and optimize the achievable rates for the
channels, and derive series of computable capacity upper and lower bounds.

realizations from a Generalized Pareto distribution, which depends on two

that the mean/max statistic, that is the empirical mean divided by the maximal

distinguish between uniform and exponential distributions, the two transitional

differ from its true value. Because this effect is more pronounced for low

which have complete coverage of their spectral energy distribution (SED) from
UV to FIR wavelengths. Using Herschel data, we disentangle the relative
contribution of the AGN and star formation by combining the

components are necessary to reproduce the observed SEDs: an evolved and massive
stellar component, a submm bright young starburst, and an AGN torus. We find
that powerful radio galaxies form at very high-redshift, but experience
episodic and important growth at 1<z<4 as the mass of the associated starburst
varies from 5 to 50% of the total mass of the system. The properties of star
formation differ from source to source, indicating no general trend of the star
formation properties in the most infrared luminous high-redshift radio galaxies
and no correlation with the AGN bolometric luminosity. Moreover, we find that
AGN scattered light have a very limited impact on broad-band SED fitting on our
sample. Finally, our analysis also suggests a wide range in origins for the
observed star formation,which we partially constrain for some sources.

risky investment assets, and introduce a health proxy to capture the decreasing
level of consumption for older retirees. Then we find optimal housing at
retirement, and optimal consumption and optimal risky asset allocation
depending on age and wealth. The model is solved numerically as a stochastic
control problem, and is calibrated using the maximum likelihood method on
empirical data of consumption and housing from the Australian Bureau of
Statistics 2009-2010 Survey. The model fits the characteristics of the data
well to explain the behavior of Australian retirees. The key findings are the
following: First, the optimal policy is highly sensitive to means-tested Age
Pension early in retirement but this sensitivity fades with age. Secondly, the
allocation to risky assets shows a complex relationship with the means-tested
Age Pension that disappears once minimum withdrawal rules are enforced. As a
general rule, when wealth decreases the proportion allocated to risky assets
increases, due to the Age Pension working as a buffer against investment
losses. Finally, couples can be more aggressive with risky allocations due to
their longer life expectancy compared with singles.

ram-pressure stripping.It is unclear which process is dominant, and over what
range of stellar mass. In this paper, we find evidence for suppression of the
cross-correlation function between massive galaxies and less massive
star-forming galaxies, giving a measure of how less likely a galaxy is to be
star-forming in the vicinity of a more massive galaxy. We develop a formalism
for modelling environmental quenching mechanisms within the Halo Occupation
Distribution scheme. We find that at $z \sim 2$ environment is not a
significant factor in determining quenching of star-forming galaxies, and that
galaxies are quenched with similar probabilities when they are satellites in
sub-group environments, as they are globally. However, by $z \sim 0.5$ galaxies
are much less likely to be star forming when in a high density (group or
low-mass cluster) environment than when not. This increased probability of
being quenched does not appear to have significant radial dependence within the
halo at lower redshifts, supportive of the quenching being caused by the
halting of fresh inflows of pristine gas, as opposed to by tidal stripping.
Furthermore, by separating the massive sample into passive and star-forming, we
see that this effect is further enhanced when the central galaxy is passive, a
manifestation of galactic conformity.

(MDC-RHB) model in which the pairing correlations are taken into account by
making the Bogoliubov transformation. In this model, the nuclear shape is
assumed to be invariant under the reversion of $x$ and $y$ axes; i.e., the
intrinsic symmetry group is $V_4$ and all shape degrees of freedom
$\beta_{\lambda\mu}$ with even $\mu$ are included self-consistently. The RHB
equation is solved in an axially deformed harmonic oscillator basis. A
separable pairing force of finite range is adopted in the MDC-RHB model. The
potential energy curves of neutron-rich even-even Zr isotopes are calculated
with relativistic functionals DD-PC1 and PC-PK1 and possible tetrahedral shapes
in the ground and isomeric states are investigated. The ground state shape of
$^{110}$Zr is predicted to be tetrahedral with both functionals and so is that
of $^{112}$Zr with the functional DD-PC1. The tetrahedral ground states are
caused by large energy gaps around $Z=40$ and $N=70$ when $\beta_{32}$
deformation is included. Although the inclusion of the $\beta_{30}$ deformation
can also reduce the energy around $\beta_{20}=0$ and lead to minima with
pear-like shapes for nuclei around $^{110}$Zr, these minima are unstable due to
their shallowness.

convenient way than desktop search. Different from the traditional desktop
search, mobile visual search needs more consideration for the limited resources
on mobile devices (e.g., bandwidth, computing power, and memory consumption).
The state-of-the-art approaches show that bag-of-words (BoW) model is robust
for image and video retrieval; however, the large vocabulary tree might not be
able to be loaded on the mobile device. We observe that recent works mainly
focus on designing compact feature representations on mobile devices for
bandwidth-limited network (e.g., 3G) and directly adopt feature matching on
remote servers (cloud). However, the compact (binary) representation might fail
to retrieve target objects (images, videos). Based on the hashed binary codes,
we propose a de-hashing process that reconstructs BoW by leveraging the
computing power of remote servers. To mitigate the information loss from binary
codes, we further utilize contextual information (e.g., GPS) to reconstruct a
context-aware BoW for better retrieval results. Experiment results show that
the proposed method can achieve competitive retrieval accuracy as BoW while
only transmitting few bits from mobile devices.

computer vision and document analysis, because of its great importance and
significant challenge. However, vast majority of the existing methods detect
text within local regions, typically through extracting character, word or line
level candidates followed by candidate aggregation and false positive
elimination, which potentially exclude the effect of wide-scope and long-range
contextual cues in the scene. To take full advantage of the rich information
available in the whole natural image, we propose to localize text in a holistic
manner, by casting scene text detection as a semantic segmentation problem. The
proposed algorithm directly runs on full images and produces global, pixel-wise
prediction maps, in which detections are subsequently formed. To better make
use of the properties of text, three types of information regarding text
region, individual characters and their relationship are estimated, with a
single Fully Convolutional Network (FCN) model. With such predictions of text
properties, the proposed algorithm can simultaneously handle horizontal,
multi-oriented and curved text in real-world natural images. The experiments on
standard benchmarks, including ICDAR 2013, ICDAR 2015 and MSRA-TD500,
demonstrate that the proposed algorithm substantially outperforms previous
state-of-the-art approaches. Moreover, we report the first baseline result on

increasing in most western countries. For a precise and early diagnosis,
several examination modalities exist, among them single-photon emission
computed tomography (SPECT) and the electroencephalogram (EEG). The latter is
highly available, free of radiation hazards, and non-invasive. Thus, its
diagnostic utility regarding different stages of dementia is of great interest
in neurological research, along with the question of whether its utility
depends on age or sex of the person being examined. However, SPECT or EEG
measurements are intrinsically multivariate, and there has been a shortage of
sufficiently general inferential techniques for the analysis of multivariate
data in factorial designs when neither multivariate normality nor equality of
covariance matrices across groups should be assumed. We adapt an asymptotic
model based (parametric) bootstrap approach to this situation, demonstrate its
ability, and use it for a truly multivariate analysis of the EEG and SPECT

These multivariate results are supplemented by marginal effects bootstrap
inference whose theoretical properties can be derived analogously to the
multivariate methods. Both inference approaches can have advantages in
particular situations, as illustrated in the data analysis.

experimentally generated ultrafast HGBs of order as high as 6 and power >180 mW

condensates, as realized with e.g. cold atomic gases, exciton-polaritons, and
more recently photons in a dye-filled optical microcavity, has paved the way
for new studies and tests of a plethora of fundamental concepts in quantum
physics. We here describe recent experiments studying a transition between
laser-like dynamics and Bose-Einstein condensation of photons in the dye
microcavity system. Further, measurements of the second-order coherence of the
photon condensate are presented. In the condensed state we observe photon
number fluctuations of order of the total particle number, as understood from
effective particle exchange with the photo-excitable dye molecules. The
observed intensity fluctuation properties give evidence for Bose-Einstein
condensation occurring in the grand-canonical statistical ensemble regime.

Testing (NHST), viewed from the perspective of Bayesian statistics, turn benign
once the traditional threshold p value of .05 is substituted by a sufficiently
smaller value. To illustrate, the posterior probability of H0 stating P=.5,
given data that just render it rejected by NHST with a p value of .05 (and a
uniform prior), is shown here to be not much smaller than .50 for most values
of N below 100 (and even exceeds .50 for N>=100); in contrast, with a p value
of .001 posterior probability does not exceed .06 for N<=100 (neither .25 for
N<9000). Yet more interesting, posterior probability becomes quite independent
of N with a p value of .0001, hence practically satisfying the alpha postulate
- set by Cornfield (1966) as the condition for p value being a measure of
evidence in itself. In view of the low prospect that most researchers will soon
convert to use Bayesian statistics in any form, we thus suggest that
researchers who elect the conservative option of resorting to NHST be
encouraged to avoid as much as possible using a p value of .05 as a threshold
for rejecting H0. The analysis presented here may be used to discuss afresh
which level of threshold p value seems to be a reasonable, practical

September 22. It is found that there were large-amplitude oscillations in P1

were triggered by a large-scale coronal wave, originating from a large flare in
a remote active region behind the solar limb. By carefully comparing the
locations and heights of these oscillating and non-oscillating structures, we
conclude that the propagating height of the wave is between 50 Mm and 130 Mm.
The wave energy deposited in the oscillating prominence and coronal loops is at
least of the order of $10^{28}$ erg. Furthermore, local magnetic field strength
and Alfv\'{e}n speeds are derived from the oscillating periods and damping time
scales, which are extracted from the time series of the oscillations. It is
demonstrated that oscillations can be used in not only coronal seismology, but

faint SN because of severe fallback of material. Later on, the object
experiences a sudden brightening of 3 mag, which results from the interaction

years that experienced a possible terminal explosion as type IIn SN in 2015,
named SN 2015bh. This possible SN or ""main event"" was preceded by a precursor
peaking $\sim$ 40 days before maximum. The total energy release of the main
event is $\sim$1.8$\times$10$^{49}$ erg, which can be modeled by a $<$ 0.5
M$_\odot$ shell plunging into a dense CSM. All emission lines show a single
narrow P-Cygni profile during the LBV phase and a double P-Cygni profile post
maximum suggesting an association of this second component with the possible
SN. Since 1994 the star has been redder than during a typical S-Dor like
outburst. SN 2015bh lies within a spiral arm of NGC 2770 next to a number of
small star-forming regions with a metallicity of $\sim$ 0.5 solar and a stellar

which, together with other examples may form a new class of objects that
exhibit outbursts a few decades prior to ""hyper-eruption"" or final
core-collapse. If the star survives this event it is undoubtedly altered, and

star over a very short timescale of only a few years. The final fate of these
types of massive stars can only be determined with observations years after the
possible SN.

regimes that can be useful for applications: (i) low and (ii) high doping of
graphene under source and drain contacts, relative to the doping level in the
graphene channel, which in an experiment can be varied by a back gate. In both
regimes, inelastic scattering induced by the ac drive can excite quasi-bound
states in the channel that leads to resonance promotion of higher order
sidebands. Already for weak to intermediate ac drive strength, this leads to a
substantial change in the direct current between source and drain. For strong
ac drive with frequency $\Omega$, we compute the higher harmonics of
frequencies $n\Omega$ ($n$ integer) in the source-drain conductance. In regime
(ii), we show that particular harmonics (for instance $n=6$) can be selectively
enhanced by tuning the doping level in the channel or by tuning the drive

polarization degree is usually small (less than 1%) and the polarization
position angle is nearly parallel to the AGN radio-axis. However, there are
many types-1 AGNs with unexplained intermediate values for both positional
angles and polarization degrees. Our explanation of polarization degree and
positional angle of Seyfert-1 AGNs focuses on the reflection of non-polarized
radiation from sub-parsec jets in optically thick accretion discs. The presence
of a magnetic field surrounding the scattering media will induce Faraday
rotation of the polarization plane that may explain the intermediate values of
positional angles if there is a magnetic field component normal to the
accretion disc. The Faraday rotation depolarization effect in disc diminishes
the competition between polarization of the reflected radiation with the
parallel component of polarization and the perpendicular polarization from
internal radiation of disc (the Milne problem) in favor of polarization of
reflected radiation. This effect allows us to explain the observed polarization
of Seyfert-1 AGN radiation even though the jet optical luminosity is much lower
than the luminosity of disc. We present the calculation of polarization degrees

few layers of water, the flow exhibits a marked enhancement that we associate

detection challenge with a public keystroke dataset containing a large number
of subjects and real-world aspects. Over 300 subjects typed case-insensitive
repetitions of their first and last name, and as a result, keystroke sequences
could vary in length and order depending on the usage of modifier keys. To deal
with this, a keystroke alignment preprocessing algorithm was developed to
establish a semantic correspondence between keystrokes in mismatched sequences.
The method is robust in the sense that query keystroke sequences need only
approximately match a target sequence, and alignment is agnostic to the
particular anomaly detector used. This paper describes the fifteen
best-performing anomaly detection systems submitted to the KBOC, which ranged
from auto-encoding neural networks to ensemble methods. Manhattan distance
achieved the lowest equal error rate of 5.32%, while all fifteen systems
performed better than any other submission. Performance gains are shown to be
due in large part not to the particular anomaly detector, but to preprocessing

includes a sever, multiple helpers, and multiple users. Basically, the proposed
caching scheme consists of two phases, i.e, placement phase and delivery phase.
In the placement phase, each helper/user randomly and independently selects
contents from the server and stores them into its memory. In the delivery
phase, the users request contents from the server, and the server satisfies
each user through a helper. Different from the existing caching scheme, the
proposed caching scheme takes into account the pre-stored contents at both
helpers and users in the placement phase to design the delivery phase.
Meanwhile, the proposed caching scheme exploits index coding in the delivery
phase and leverages multicast opportunities, even when different users request
distinct contents. Besides, we analytically characterize the performance limit
of the proposed caching scheme, and show that the achievable rate region of the
proposed caching scheme lies within constant margins to the
information-theoretic optimum. In particular, the multiplicative and additive
factors are carefully sharpened to be $\frac{1}{48}$ and $4$ respectively, both
of which are better than the state of arts. Finally, simulation results
demonstrate the advantage of the proposed caching scheme compared with the
state of arts.

single-molecule spectroscopy to unravel the influence of charges on several
photoluminescence (PL) observables. The charges are injected either
stochastically by a photochemical process, or deterministically in a
hole-injection sandwich device configuration. We find that upon charge
injection, besides a blue-shift of the PL emission and a shortening of the PL
lifetime due to quenching and blocking of the lowest-energy chromophores, the
non-classical photon arrival time distribution of the multichromophoric chain
is modified towards a more classical distribution. Surprisingly, the fidelity
of photon antibunching deteriorates upon charging, whereas one would actually
expect the number of chromophores to be reduced. A qualitative model is
presented to explain the observed PL changes. The results are of interest to
developing a microscopic understanding of the intrinsic charge-exciton

obtain a second-order phase transition between an incoherent (the
high-temperature phase) and coherent (the low-temperatures phase) states of
photons. This phase transition in many aspects resembles the
paramagnetic-ferromagnetic phase transition. The critical temperature of the
phase transition, $T^\star$, is determined by the energy splitting of two-level
systems $\delta$, number of qubits in the array $N$, and the strength of the
interaction $\eta$ between qubits and photons in the cavity. We obtain that the
photon states manifest themselves by resonant drops in the frequency dependent
transmission $D(\omega)$ of electromagnetic waves propagating through a
transmission line weakly coupled to the SQM. At high temperatures the
$D(\omega)$ displays a single resonant drop, and at low temperatures a peculiar
\emph{double resonance response} has to be observed. The physical origin of
such a resonant splitting is the quantum oscillations between two coherent

similar traits, has been identified as a major driving force in the formation

the result of a socialization process, where individuals change their traits
according to the dominance of that trait in their local social networks, or if
it results from a selection process, in which individuals reshape their social
networks so that their traits match those in the new environment. Here we
demonstrate the detailed temporal formation of strong homophily in academic
achievements of high school and university students. We analyze a unique
dataset that contains information about the detailed time evolution of a
friendship network of 6,000 students across 42 months. Combining the evolving
social network data with the time series of the academic performance (GPA) of
individual students, we show that academic homophily is a result of selection:
students prefer to gradually reorganize their social networks according to
their performance levels, rather than adapting their performance to the level
of their local group. We find no signs for a pull effect, where a social
environment of good performers motivates bad students to improve their
performance. We are able to understand the underlying dynamics of grades and
networks with a simple model. The lack of a social pull effect in classical
educational settings could have important implications for the understanding of
the observed persistence of segregation, inequality and social immobility in
societies.

symbiotic systems (i.e. with a WD as a secondary star), main-sequence
companions of AGB stars can be more numerous, even though they are more
difficult to find because the primary high luminosity hampers the detection of
the companion at visual wavelengths. However, in the ultraviolet the flux
emitted by a secondary with T eff > 5500 ~ 6000 K may prevail over that of the
primary, and then it can be used to search for candidates to binary AGB stars.
In this work, theoretical atmosphere models are used to calculate the UV excess
in the GALEX near- and far-UV bands due to a main-sequence companion. After
analysing a sample of confirmed binary AGB stars, we propose as a criterium for
binarity: (1) the detection of the AGB star in the GALEX far-UV band and/or (2)
a GALEX near-UV observed-to-predicted flux ratio > 20. These criteria have been
applied to a volume-limited sample of AGB stars within 500 pc of the Sun; 34
out of the sample of 58 AGB stars ( ~ 60%) fulfill them, implying to have a MS
companion of spectral type earlier than K0. The excess in the GALEX near- and
far-UV bands cannot be attributed to a single temperature companion star, thus
suggesting that the UV emission of the secondary might be absorbed by the
extended atmosphere and circumstellar envelope of the primary or that UV
emission is produced in accretion flows.

variables. The classical Kalman filter is no longer computationally feasible in
such a high dimensional context. This problem can often be resolved by
exploiting the underlying multiscale structure, applying the full Kalman
filtering procedures only to the large scale vari- ables, and estimating the
small scale variables with proper statistical strategies, including
multiplicative inflation, representation model error in the observations, and
crude localization. The resulting two-scale reduced filters can have close to
optimal numerical filtering skill based on previous numerical evidence. Yet, no
rigorous explanation exists for this success, because these modifications
create unavoidable bias and model error. This paper contributes to this issue
by establishing a new error analysis framework for two different reduced random
Kalman filters, valid independent of the large dimension. The first part of our
results examines the fidelity of the covariance estimators, which is essential
for accurate uncertainty quantification. In a simplified setting, this is
demonstrated by showing the true error covariance is dominated by its
estimators. In general settings, the Mahalanobis error and its intrinsic
dissipation can indicate covariance fidelity. The second part develops upper
bounds for the covariance estimators by comparing with proper Kalman filters.
Combining both results, the classical tools for Kalman filters can be used as
a-priori performance criteria for the reduced filters. In applications, these
criteria guarantee the reduced filters are robust, and accurate for small noise
systems. They also shed light on how to tune the reduced filters for stochastic
turbulence.

density-density interactions in which each site of the 1D lattice is at most
singly occupied, and strong Raman coupling, in distinction to previous work
which has focused on the weak Raman coupling case. This allows us to keep only
a single state per site and derive a low energy effective spin $1/2$ model. The
effective model contains first-order nearest neighbour tunnelling terms, and
second-order nearest neighbour interactions and correlated next-nearest
neighbour tunnelling terms. By adjusting the flux $\phi$ one can tune the
relative importance of first-order and second-order terms in the effective
Hamiltonian. In particular, first-order terms can be set to zero, realising a
novel model with dominant second-order terms. We show that the resulting
competition between density-dependent tunnelling and repulsive density-density
interaction leads to an interesting phase diagram including a phase with
long-ranged pair-superfluid correlations. The method can be straightforwardly
extended to higher dimensions and lattices of arbitrary geometry including
geometrically frustrated lattices where the interplay of frustration,

magnetic field configuration in the poloidal direction is formed along the
funnel wall accompanied by the generation of a large Poynting flux. The

geometry over a range of stretch rates on dual crosslink hydrogels made from
polyvinyl alcohol chains chemically crosslinked with glutaraldehyde and
physically crosslinked with borate ions. If the energy release rate necessary
for crack propagation was calculated conventionally, by using the work done to
deform the sample to the critical value of stretch $\lambda_c$ where the crack
propagates, we found that the fracture energy $\Gamma$ peaks around
$\lambda\sim 0.001 s^{-1}$ before decreasing sharply with increasing stretch
rate, in contradiction with the measurements of crack velocity. Combining
simulations and experimental observations, we propose therefore here a general
method to separate the energy dissipated during loading before crack
propagation, from that which is dissipated during crack propagation. For fast
loading rates (with a characteristic strain rate only slightly lower than the
inverse of the typical breaking time of physical bonds), this improved method
to estimate a local energy release rate $g_{local}$ at the onset of crack
propagation, gives a value of the local fracture energy $\Gamma_{local}$ which
is constant, consistent with the constant value of the crack propagation
velocity measured experimentally. Using this improved method we also obtain the
very interesting result that the dual crosslink gels have a much higher value
of fracture energy at low loading rates than at high loading rates, contrary to
the situation in classical chemically crosslinked elastic networks.

Predictors of fixation locations are bottom-up factors like luminance contrast,
top-down factors like viewing instruction, and systematic biases like the
tendency to place fixations near the center of an image. However, comparatively
little is known about the dynamics of scanpaths after experimental manipulation
of specific fixation locations. Here we investigate the influence of initial
fixation position on subsequent eye-movement behavior on an image. We presented
64 colored photographs to participants who started their scanpaths from one of
two experimentally controlled positions in the right or left part of an image.
Additionally, we computed the images' saliency maps and classified them as
balanced images or images with high saliency values on either the left or right
side of a picture. As a result of the starting point manipulation, we found
long transients of mean fixation position and a tendency to overshoot to the
image side opposite to the starting position. Possible mechanisms for the
generation of this overshoot were investigated using numerical simulations of
statistical and dynamical models. We conclude that inhibitory tagging is a
viable mechanism for dynamical planning of scanpaths.

establish baselines for statistical tests on regular graphs.

features, ferrogels and magnetorheological elastomers allow a synergy of
elasticity and magnetism. The interplay between elastic and magnetic properties
gives rise to a unique reversible control of the material behavior by applying
an external magnetic field. Albeit few works have been performed on the
time-dependent properties so far, understanding the dynamic behavior is the key
to model many practical situations, e.g. applications as vibration absorbers.
Here we present a way to calculate the frequency-dependent elastic moduli based
on the decomposition of the linear response to an external stress in normal
modes. We use a minimal three-dimensional dipole-spring model to theoretically
describe the magnetic and elastic interactions on the mesoscopic level.
Specifically, the magnetic particles carry permanent magnetic dipole moments
and are spatially arranged in a prescribed way, before they are linked by
elastic springs. An external magnetic field aligns the magnetic moments. On the
one hand, we study regular lattice-like particle arrangements to compare with
previous results in the literature. On the other hand, we calculate the dynamic
elastic moduli for irregular, more realistic particle distributions. Our
approach measures the tunability of the linear dynamic response as a function
of the particle arrangement, the system orientation with respect to the
external magnetic field, as well as the magnitude of the magnetic interaction
between the particles. The strength of the present approach is that it
explicitly connects the relaxational modes of the system with the rheological
properties as well as with the internal rearrangement of the particles in the
sample, providing new insight into the dynamics of these remarkable materials.

It is
a ""stochastic-on-time-arrival (SOTA)""-like algorithm which calculates optimal
guidance strategies with reliable paths, for road network origin-destination
pairs. Our contribution consists here in extending an existing SOTA algorithm,
in order to include robustness of the guidance strategy, towards path failures.
The idea of SOTA algorithms is to calculate the maximum probability of reaching
a destination node, starting from any node of a road network, and given a time
budget. This calculus gives the optimal path for every origin-destination pair
of nodes in the network, with an associated optimal adaptive guidance strategy.
We propose here an extension of this approach in order to take into account the
existence and the performance of alternative detours of the selected paths, in
the calculus of the guidance strategy. We take into account the fact that one
or many links of the selected optimal path may fail during the travel. We then
consider that users may be sensitive to path changing. That is to say that they
may prefer paths with efficient alternative detours, with respect to paths
without, or with less efficient detours, even with a loss in the average travel
time, and/or in its reliability. In order to take into account such behaviors,
we propose a model that includes the existence as well as the performance of
detours for selected paths, in the calculus of the travel time reliability.
This new way of calculating travel time reliability guarantees a kind of
robustness of the guidance strategies.

approach that allows for a realistic treatment of structural relaxations and
electronic effects beyond a purely rigid band approach. By means of the band
unfolding technique we have computed the spectral function and constructed the
effective band structure and Fermi surface (FS), which are readily comparable
with available experimental data. Our calculations clearly indicate that La and
Rh doping can be interpreted as effective electron and (fractional) hole
doping, respectively. In Sr$_{2-x}$La$_x$IrO$_4$ the IMT is accompanied by a
moderate renormalization of the electronic correlation substantiated by a
reduction of the effective on-site Coulomb repulsion $U-J$ from 1.6 eV ($x=0$)
to 1.4 eV (metallic regime $x=12.5\%$). The progressive closing of the
relativistic Mott gap leads to the emergence of connected elliptical electron
pockets at ($\pi$/2,$\pi$/2) and less intense features at $X$ in the FS. The
substitution of Ir with the nominally isovalent Rh is accompanied by a
substantial hole transfer from the Rh site to the nearest neighbor Ir sites.
This shifts down the chemical potential, creates almost circular disconnected
hole pockets in the FS and establishes the emergence of a two-dimensional
metallic state formed by conducting Rh-planes intercalated by insulating
Ir-planes. Finally, our data indicate that hole doping causes a flipping of the
in-plane net ferromagnetic moment in the Rh plane and induces a magnetic
transition from the AF-I to the AF-II ordering.

by-product of this comparison, we found that pulsation periods of BL stars
follow Gaussian distribution with the mean period of $0.54\pm0.07$ d, while the
modulation periods show log-normal distribution with centre at $\log(P_{\rm

has made possible to detect the central areas of a neural system, and to
identify its building blocks by looking at overabundant small subgraphs, known
as motifs. However, network analysis of the brain has so far mainly focused on
anatomical and functional networks as separate entities. The recently developed
mathematical framework of multi-layer networks allows to perform an analysis of
the human brain where the structural and functional layers are considered
together. In this work we describe how to classify the subgraphs of a multiplex
network, and we extend motif analysis to networks with an arbitrary number of
layers. We then extract multi-layer motifs in brain networks of healthy
subjects by considering networks with two layers, anatomical and functional,
respectively obtained from diffusion and functional magnetic resonance imaging.
Results indicate that subgraphs in which the presence of a physical connection
between brain areas (links at the structural layer) coexists with a non-trivial
positive correlation in their activities are statistically overabundant.
Finally, we investigate the existence of a reinforcement mechanism between the
two layers by looking at how the probability to find a link in one layer
depends on the intensity of the connection in the other one. Showing that
functional connectivity is non-trivially constrained by the underlying
anatomical network, our work contributes to a better understanding of the
interplay between structure and function in the human brain.

which relies on a Cloud-based IoT paradigm. The methodology is adaptive in
terms of the rate of execution of the estimation process which varies depending
on the indications of the distributed measurement system. The system is
composed, in particular, of Phasor Measurement Units (PMUs). PMUs are
virtualized with respect to the physical devices and the corresponding
virtualizing modules run in the communication network edge (i.e. closer to the
physical objects). PMUs are set at a higher measurement rate, while the
estimation process works at a given slower rate, for example once per second,
in normal operative conditions. A local decision algorithm implemented in the
virtualized module, monitors the measured quantities in order to detect and
address possible unexpected dynamics. In particular, different metrics can be
applied: the variations and the trend of variation of the rms voltage values,
but also the Rate Of Change Of Frequency (ROCOF) of the monitored signals can
be used to trigger rate variation in the DSSE.In case dynamics are detected,
the measurement data is sent to the DSSE at higher rates and the estimation
process runs consequently on a finer time scale. In the considered system only
application level entities are located in the Cloud, thus allowing to obtain a
bandwidth-efficient and smart data transmission. The results obtained on a
13-bus systems prove the goodness of the proposed methodologies.

  spectrometry proteomic data",,,,,"stat.ME","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Despite the recent advances in mass spectrometry (MS), summarizing and
analyzing high-throughput mass-spectrometry data remains a challenging task.
This is, on the one hand, due to the complexity of the spectral signal which is
measured, and on the other, due to the limit of detection (LOD). The LOD is
related to the limitation of instruments in measuring markers at a relatively
low level. As a consequence, the outcome data set from the quantification step
of proteomic analysis often consists of a reduced list of peaks where any peak
intensities below the detection limit threshold are reported as missings. In
this work, we propose the use of censored data methodology to handle spectral
measurements within the presence of LOD, recognizing that those have been
censored due to left-censoring mechanisms on low-abundance proteins. We apply
this approach to the particular problem of calibrating prediction rules through
prior estimation of the average isotope expression in MALDI-FTICR
mass-spectrometry data, collected in the context of a pancreatic cancer
case-control study. Our idea is to replace the set of incomplete spectral
measurements with the average intensity estimates and use those as new input to
a prediction model. We evaluate the proposed methods, with respect to their
predictive ability, by comparing their performance with the one achieved using
the complete information as well as alternative/competitive methods to deal

static state is linearly unstable ($R_L$), and the energy analysis yields a
Rayleigh number below which it is globally stable ($R_E$). For various boundary
conditions on the velocity, exact expressions for $R_L$ and $R_E$ are found
using long-wavelength asymptotics. Each $R_E$ is strictly smaller than the
corresponding $R_L$ but is within 1%. The lower bound on the mean temperature

aims to adjust the elements of an array to satisfy specified row and column
sums. Given a rectangular non-negative matrix $X_0$ and two positive marginals
$a$ and $b$, the algorithm generates a sequence of matrices $(X_n)$ starting at
$X_0$, supposed to converge to a biproportional fitting, that is, to a matrix
$Y$ whose marginals are $a$ and $b$ and of the form $Y=D_1X_0D_2$, for some
diagonal matrices $D_1$ and $D_2$ with positive diagonal entries.
  When a biproportional fitting does exist, it is unique and the sequence
$(X_n)$ converges to it at an at least geometric rate. More generally, when
there exists some matrix with marginal $a$ and $b$ and with support included in
the support of $X_0$, the sequence $(X_n)$ converges to the unique matrix whose
marginals are $a$ and $b$ and which can be written as a limit of matrices of
the form $D_1X_0D_2$. In the opposite case, the sequence $(X_n)$ diverges but
both subsequences $(X_{2n})$ and $(X_{2n+1})$ converge.
  In the present paper, we use a new method to prove again these results and
determine the two limit-points in the case of divergence. Our proof relies on a
new convergence theorem for backward infinite products $\cdots M_2M_1$ of
stochatic matrices $M_n$, with diagonal entries $M_n(i,i)$ bounded away from
$0$ and with bounded ratios $M_n(j,i)/M_n(i,j)$. This theorem generalizes
Lorenz' stabilization theorem.
  We also provide an alternative proof of Touric and Nedi\'c's theorem on
backward infinite products of doubly-stochatic matrices, with diagonal entries
bounded away from $0$. In both situations, we improve slightly the conclusion,
since we establish not only the convergence of the sequence $(M_n \cdots M_1)$,
but also its finite variation.

The existence and structure of optimal codes are studied using a stochastic
control formulation. Prior results in the literature established the optimality
of deterministic Markov (Walrand-Varaiya type) coding policies for finite time
horizon problem, and the optimality of both deterministic nonstationary and
randomized stationary policies for the infinite time horizon problem. Our main
result here shows that for any irreducible and aperiodic Markov source with a
finite alphabet, \emph{deterministic and stationary} Markov coding policies are
optimal for the infinite horizon problem. In addition, the finite blocklength

is shown to approach the infinite time horizon optimum at a rate $O(1/T)$. The
results are extended to systems where zero delay communication takes place

grows, it becomes increasingly challenging to deliver aggregate responses while
keeping response times and computational costs under control. Ad-hoc heuristic
approaches have been introduced to address this challenge and research has been
conducted aimed at optimizing query routing based on archive profiles. In this
paper, we explore the use of binary, archive-specific classifiers generated on
the basis of the content cached by an Aggregator, to determine whether or not
to query an archive for a given URI. Our results turn out to be readily
applicable and can help to significantly decrease both the number of requests

others, that classifiers can reduce the average number of requests by 77%
compared to a brute force approach on all archives, and the overall response
time by 42% while maintaining a recall of 0.847.

a version of the code ROTFIT that exploits a wide and homogeneous collection of
real star spectra, i.e. the Indo US library. We provide a catalog with the
atmospheric parameters (Teff, logg, [Fe/H]), the radial velocity (RV) and an
estimate of the projected rotation velocity (vsini). For cool stars (Teff<6000
K) we have also calculated the H-alpha and CaII-IRT chromospheric fluxes. We
have derived the RV and the atmospheric parameters for 61,753 spectra of 51,385
stars. Literature data for a few hundred stars have been used to do a quality
control of our results. The final accuracy of RV, Teff, logg, and [Fe/H]
measurements is about 14 km/s, 3.5%, 0.3 dex, and 0.2 dex, respectively.
However, while the Teff values are in very good agreement with the literature,
we noted some issues with the determination of [Fe/H] of metal poor stars and
the tendency, for logg, to cluster around the values typical for main sequence
and red giant stars. We propose correction relations based on these comparison.
The RV distribution is asymmetric and shows an excess of stars with negative
RVs which is larger at low metallicities. We could identify stars with variable
RV, ultrafast rotators, and emission-line objects. Based on the H-alpha and
CaII-IRT fluxes, we have found 442 chromospherically active stars, one of which
is a likely accreting object. The availability of precise rotation periods from
the Kepler photometry has allowed us to study the dependency of the
chromospheric fluxes on the rotation rate for a quite large sample of field
stars.

popular in recent years. However, naive gradient methods generally converge
slowly. Hence, much efforts have been made to accelerate various first-order
methods. This paper proposes two accelerated methods towards solving structured
linearly constrained convex programming, for which we assume composite convex
objective.
  The first method is the accelerated linearized augmented Lagrangian method
(LALM). At each update to the primal variable, it allows linearization to the
differentiable function and also the augmented term, and thus it enables easy
subproblems. Assuming merely weak convexity, we show that LALM owns $O(1/t)$
convergence if parameters are kept fixed during all the iterations and can be
accelerated to $O(1/t^2)$ if the parameters are adapted, where $t$ is the
number of total iterations.
  The second method is the accelerated linearized alternating direction method
of multipliers (LADMM). In addition to the composite convexity, it further
assumes two-block structure on the objective. Different from classic ADMM, our
method allows linearization to the objective and also augmented term to make
the update simple. Assuming strong convexity on one block variable, we show
that LADMM also enjoys $O(1/t^2)$ convergence with adaptive parameters. This
result is a significant improvement over that in [Goldstein et. al, SIIMS'14],
which requires strong convexity on both block variables and no linearization to
the objective or augmented term.
  Numerical experiments are performed on quadratic programming, image
denoising, and support vector machine. The proposed accelerated methods are
compared to nonaccelerated ones and also existing accelerated methods. The
results demonstrate the validness of acceleration and superior performance of
the proposed methods over existing ones.

between approximate solutions constructed by the upwind scheme and
distributional solutions of the continuous problem in a Kantorovich-Rubinstein
distance, which was recently used for stability estimates for the continuity
equation by Seis [23]. Restricted to Cartesian meshes, our estimate shows that
the rate of weak convergence is at least of order $1/2$ in the mesh size. The
proof relies on a probabilistic interpretation of the upwind scheme Delarue and
Lagouti\`ere [9]. We complement the weak convergence result with an example
that illustrates that for rough initial data no rates can be expected in strong

model describing the evolution of the velocity, the anaerobic energy, and the

Newton's second law and energy conservation, is coupled to the condition of
optimizing the time to run a fixed distance. We show that the monotony of the

short run, we prove that the velocity is exponentially increasing to its

increasing start and a decreasing end and this accounts for the change of
velocity profiles. Numerical simulations are compared to timesplits from real

tungsten-based alloys are being considered as plasma-facing candidate materials
in fusion devices. Under neutron irradiation, rhenium, which is produced by
nuclear transmutation, has been found to precipitate in elongated precipitates
forming thermodynamic intermetallic phases at concentrations well below the
solubility limit. Recent measurements have shown that Re precipitation can lead
to substantial hardening, which may have a detrimental effect on the fracture
toughness of W alloys. This puzzle of sub-solubility precipitation points to
the role played by irradiation induced defects, specifically mixed solute-W
interstitials. Here, using first-principles calculations based on density
functional theory, we study the energetics of mixed interstitial defects in
W-Re, W-V, and W-Ti alloys, as well as the heat of mixing for each
substitutional solute. We find that mixed interstitials in all systems are
strongly attracted to each other with binding energies of -2.4 to -3.2 eV and
form interstitial pairs that are aligned along parallel first-neighbor <111>
strings. Low barriers for defect translation and rotation enable defect
agglomeration and alignment even at moderate temperatures. We propose that
these elongated agglomerates of mixed-interstitials may act as precursors for
the formation of needle-shaped intermetallic precipitates. This

with a small number of generators (n=2,3) are considered. For some number r of
relations possible Hilbert series are listed, and those appearing as series of
Koszul algebras are specified. The first case, where it was not possible to do,
namely the case of three generators n=3 and six relations r=6 is formulated as
an open problem. We give here a complete answer to this question, namely for
quadratic algebras with dim A_1=dim A_2=3, we list all possible Hilbert series,
and find out which of them can come from Koszul algebras, and which can not.
  As a consequence of this classification, we found an algebra, which serves as
a counterexample to another problem from the same book [23] (Chapter 7, Sec. 1,
Conjecture 2), saying that Koszul algebra of finite global homological
dimension d has dim A_1 >= d. Namely, the 3-generated algebra A given by
relations xx+yx=xz=zy=0 is Koszul and its Koszul dual algebra A^! has Hilbert
series of degree 4: H_{A^!}(t)= 1+3t+3t^2+2t^3+t^4, hence A has global
homological dimension 4.

adhere to their system of beliefs and to form polarized groups -- i.e., echo
chambers. Such a tendency dominates information cascades and might affect
public debates on social relevant issues. In this work we explore the
structural evolution of communities of interest by accounting for users
emotions and engagement. Focusing on the Facebook pages reporting on scientific
and conspiracy content, we characterize the evolution of the size of the two
communities by fitting daily resolution data with three growth models -- i.e.
the Gompertz model, the Logistic model, and the Log-logistic model. Then, we
explore the interplay between emotional state and engagement of users in the
group dynamics. Our findings show that communities' emotional behavior is
affected by the users' involvement inside the echo chamber. Indeed, to an
higher involvement corresponds a more negative approach. Moreover, we observe
that, on average, more active users show a faster shift towards the negativity
than less active ones.

removable tsunami wall is proposed theoretically. The lenses are made of
expandable rubber pillars or balloons and create a stop-band by the rotating
the incoming tsunami wave and reduce the pressure by canceling each other. The
diameter of each lens is larger than the wavelength of the tsunami near the
coast, that is, order of a kilometer. The impedance matching on the border of
the lenses results in little reflection. Before a tsunami, the balloons are
buried underground in shallow water near the coast in folded or rounded form.
Upon sounding of the tsunami alarm, water and air are pumped into the pillars,
which expand and erect the wall above the sea level within a few hours. After
the tsunami, the water and air are released from the pillars, which are then
buried underground for reuse. Electricity is used to power the entire process.
A numerical simulation with a linear tsunami model was carried out.

ultraviolet (UV) and intense photosynthetically available radiation (PAR) but
the effects on ocean productivity have received little consideration aside from
polar areas subject to periodic enhanced UV-B due to depletion of stratospheric
ozone. Here we consider responses in the temperate and tropical mid-ocean
regions typically dominated by picophytoplankton including the prokaryotic
lineages, $\textit{Prochlorococcus}$ and $\textit{Synechococcus}$. Spectral
models of photosynthetic response for each lineage were constructed using model
strains cultured at different growth irradiances and temperatures. In the
model, inhibition becomes more severe once exposure exceeds a threshold (Emax)
related to repair capacity. Model parameters are presented for
$\textit{Prochlorococcus}$ adding to those previously presented for
$\textit{Synechococcus}$. The models were applied to the estimation of mid-day,
water-column photosynthesis based on an atmospheric model of spectral incident
radiation, satellite-derived spectral water transparency and sea surface
temperature. Comparing predictions integrated over the water column including
versus excluding inhibition, production was 7-28% lower due to inhibition
depending on strain and site conditions. Inhibition was consistently greater
for $\textit{Prochlorococcus}$ compared to two strains of
$\textit{Synechococcus}$. Considering only the surface mixed layer, production
was inhibited 7-73%. Weighted by lineage abundance and daily PAR exposure,
inhibition of full water column production averages around 20% for the modeled
region of the Pacific with two-thirds of the inhibition due to UV. The results
suggest more consideration is needed on inhibition effects, especially due to
UV, which are largely excluded from present models of global phytoplankton
production.

of a spatially flat isotropic and homogeneous
Friedmann-Lemaitre-Robertson-Walker (FLRW) universe. At first, Lie point
symmetry is imposed to the system and the unknown coupled potential of the
model is determined. Then Noether symmetry, which is also a point like symmetry
of the Lagrangian, is imposed on the physical system and the potential takes a
general form. It is shown that the Lie algebra of Noether symmetry is a
sub-algebra of the corresponding Lie algebra of the Lie symmetry. Finally, a
point transformation in the three dimensional augmented space is performed
suitably so that one of the variables become cyclic and as a result there is
considerable simplification to the physical system. Hence conserved quantities
(i.e, constants of motion) are expressed in a compact form and cosmological
solutions are evaluated and analyzed in the present context.
