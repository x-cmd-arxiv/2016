the statistical behavior of a system. Therefore, thermal fluctuation is an
inseparable characteristic of these parameters which eventually finds its way
into experimental data. Analyzing these fluctuations is very useful in studying
the phase transitions of a physical system or its behavior around critical
points. However, this approach is not straightforward as most of the times it
is impossible to distinguish meaningful thermal fluctuations from those due to
the instrumental errors. In this article, we have offered a method by which an
experimenter can separate this multi-sourced fluctuation into its constitutive
parts according to their sources. Although the article is only focused on a
specific system, which is a high pressure charged gas, we have used a
computational method which could be used for various other systems. Our
proposed idea is very efficient and reduces the required computation time by a
remarkable fraction. We have used Euler algorithm, which generally does not
hold the internal energy conserved; But we have used this fact as a tool which
allows us to surf in the phase space of the system and reach different energy
levels in significantly less time. Although system does not spend enough time
in a single energy level to equilibrate, but we have been able to extract the
details of the equilibrium state out of our data. Using numerical computations
combined with theoretical modelings we have given a final expression for the
amount of the overall fluctuations existing in the measured pressure values.
This expression is given in terms of the characteristics of both the gas and
the barometer so that it can be experimentally verified.

consider using energy storage in data centers for two applications in a joint
fashion: reducing peak demand charges and enabling data centers to participate
in regulation markets. We develop an optimization framework that captures the
cost of electricity, degradation of energy storage devices, as well as the
benefit from regulation markets. Under this frame- work, using real data
Microsoft data center traces and PJM regulation signals, we show the
electricity bill of a data center can be reduced by up to 20%. Furthermore, we
demonstrate that the saving from joint optimization can be even larger than the
sum of individually optimizing each component. We quantify the particular
aspects of data center load profiles that lead to this superlinear gain.
Compared to prior works that consider using energy storage devices for each
single application alone, our results suggest that energy storage in data
centers can have much larger impacts than previously thought possible.

decreases continuously with increase in temperature and reaches to $\sim$46
$\mu$V/K at $\sim$600 K. The electronic and TE properties of the compound have
also been investigated by combining the \textit{ab-initio} electronic
structures and Boltzmann transport calculations. LSDA plus Hubbard U (U= 2.75
eV) calculation on low spin configuration of the compound gives an energy gap
of $\sim$0.5 eV, which is close to the experimentally reported energy gap. The
effective mass of holes (\textit{m$^{*}_h$}) at $\Gamma$ point is nearly two
times larger than the value of effective mass of electrons (\textit{m$^{*}_e$})
at FB point along the L and T directions, whereas the \textit{m$^{*}_e$} at FB
point along the $\Gamma$ direction is nearly eight times larger than the value
of \textit{m$^{*}_h$} at $\Gamma$ point along the FB direction. The large
effective mass at FB point along the $\Gamma$ direction suggests that the TE
property of this compound is mainly decided by the effective mass of the charge
carriers in this direction. The calculated temperature dependent values of
$\alpha$ are in fairly good agreement with experimental data in the temperature
range 300-360 K, and above this temperature slight deviation is observed. The
value of power factor (PF) for \textit{n}-type is $\sim$1.3 times larger the
value of \textit{p}-type doped compound at 1100 K. The value of
\textit{figure-of-merit} (\textit{ZT}) for \textit{n}-type doped compound is
obtained $\sim$0.35 in the temperature range 600-1100 K, which suggests that
with appropriate \textit{n}-type doping this compound can be used as a good TE
material in the high temperature region.

  arXiv:1206.4987 by other authors",,,,"cs.SI physics.soc-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The goal of community detection algorithms is to identify densely-connected
units within large networks. An implicit assumption is that all the constituent
nodes belong equally to their associated community. However, some nodes are
more important in the community than others. To date, efforts have been
primarily driven to identify communities as a whole, rather than understanding
to what extent an individual node belongs to its community. Therefore, most
metrics for evaluating communities, for example modularity, are global. These
metrics produce a score for each community, not for each individual node. In
this paper, we argue that the belongingness of nodes in a community is not
uniform.
  The central idea of permanence is based on the observation that the strength
of membership of a vertex to a community depends upon two factors: (i) the the
extent of connections of the vertex within its community versus outside its
community, and (ii) how tightly the vertex is connected internally. We discuss
how permanence can help us understand and utilize the structure and evolution
of communities by demonstrating that it can be used to -- (i) measure the
persistence of a vertex in a community, (ii) design strategies to strengthen
the community structure, (iii) explore the core-periphery structure within a
community, and (iv) select suitable initiators for message spreading.
  We demonstrate that the process of maximizing permanence produces meaningful
communities that concur with the ground-truth community structure of the
networks more accurately than eight other popular community detection
algorithms. Finally, we show that the communities obtained by this method are
(i) less affected by the changes in vertex-ordering, and (ii) more resilient to
resolution limit, degeneracy of solutions and asymptotic growth of values.

elastic interactions of dislocations are crucial for capturing various types of
dislocation patterns formed in crystalline materials. In this article, the
continuum dynamics of straight dislocations distributed on two parallel slip
planes is modelled through upscaling the underlying discrete dislocation
dynamics. Two continuum velocity field quantities are introduced to facilitate
the discrete-to-continuum transition. The first one is the local migration
velocity of dislocation ensembles which is found fully independent of the
short-range dislocation correlations. The second one is the decoupling velocity
of dislocation pairs controlled by a threshold stress value, which is proposed
to be the effective flow stress for single slip systems. Compared to the almost
ubiquitously adopted Taylor relationship, the derived flow stress formula
exhibits two features that are more consistent with the underlying discrete
dislocation dynamics: i) the flow stress increases with the in-plane component
of the dislocation density only up to a certain value, hence the derived
formula admits a minimum inter-dislocation distance within slip planes; ii) the
flow stress smoothly transits to zero when all dislocations become
geometrically necessary dislocations. A regime under which inhomogeneities in
dislocation density grow is identified, and is further validated through
comparison with discrete dislocation dynamical simulation results. Based on the
findings in this article and in our previous works, a general strategy for
incorporating short-range dislocation correlations in continuum models of
dislocations is proposed.

the role of the flexocoupling between the order parameter and elastic strain

presence of squired elastic strain gradient. The squired elastic strain
gradient is required for the free energy stability to arbitrary strain
gradients. Obtained analytical expressions showed that the fundamental upper
limit for the magnitude of the static bulk flexoelectric effect strength,
established by Yudin and Tagantsev under the absence of squired elastic strain
gradient and higher order gradients terms, should be substituted by the
temperature-dependent condition on the flexoelectric coupling strength under
the presence of the gradient terms. Moreover, we established that the SMP
appears and becomes stable in commensurate ferroics if the flexocoupling
constant exceeds the critical value, defined by the reduced temperature, strain
and order parameter gradients constants, striction and expansion coefficients
in the LGD functional. We calculated the soft phonon dispersion in ferroics
with commensurate and incommensurate long-range ordered phases allowing for the
squired elastic strain gradient, as well as static and dynamic flexocoupling.

rigid motion and labeling of two point sets so that they are as close as
possible. Both rigid and non-rigid shape matching problems can be formulated as
PM problems. Recently [Maron et al.] presented a novel convex semi-definite
programming relaxation (PM-SDP) for PM which achieves state of the art results
on common shape matching benchmarks.
  In this paper we analyze the successfulness of PM-SDP in solving PM problems
without noise (Exact PM problems). We begin by showing Exact PM to be
computationally equivalent to the graph isomorphism problem. We demonstrate
some natural theoretical properties of the relaxation, and use these properties
together with the moment interpretation of [Lasserre] to show that for exact PM
problems and for (generic) input shapes which are asymmetric or bilaterally
symmetric, the relaxation returns a correct solution of PM.
  For symmetric shapes, PM has multiple solutions. The non-convex set of
optimal solutions of PM is strictly contained in the convex set of optimal
solutions of PM-SDP, so that `most' solutions of PM-SDP will not be solutions
of PM. We deal with this by showing the solution set of PM to be the extreme
points of the solution set of PM-SDP, and suggesting a random algorithm which
returns a solution of PM with probability one, and returns all solutions of PM
with equal probability. We also show these results can be extended to the
almost-exact case.
  To the best of our knowledge, our work is the first to achieve exact recovery
in the presence of multiple solutions.

stream, which rapidly computes object representations that are both specific
for object identity and relatively robust against identity-preserving
transformations like depth-rotations. Current computational models of object
recognition, including recent deep learning networks, generate these properties
through a hierarchy of alternating selectivity-increasing filtering and
tolerance-increasing pooling operations, similar to simple-complex cells
operations. While simulations of these models recapitulate the ventral stream's
progression from early view-specific to late view-tolerant representations,
they fail to generate the most salient property of the intermediate
representation for faces found in the brain: mirror-symmetric tuning of the
neural population to head orientation. Here we prove that a class of
hierarchical architectures and a broad set of biologically plausible learning
rules can provide approximate invariance at the top level of the network. While
most of the learning rules do not yield mirror-symmetry in the mid-level

commonly assumed core-envelope structure with an adiabatic temperature profile.
Different primordial internal structures as well as various physical processes
can lead to non-homogenous compositional distributions. A non-homogenous
internal structure has a significant impact on the thermal evolution and final
structure of the planets. In this paper, we present alternative structure and
evolution models for Jupiter and Saturn allowing for non-adiabatic primordial
structures and the mixing of heavy elements by convection as these planets
evolve. We present the evolution of the planets accounting for various initial
composition gradients, and in the case of Saturn, include the formation of a
helium-rich region as a result of helium rain. We investigate the stability of
regions with composition gradients against convection, and find that the helium
shell in Saturn remains stable and does not mix with the rest of the envelope.
In other cases, convection mixes the planetary interior despite the existence
of compositional gradients, leading to the enrichment of the envelope with
heavy elements. We show that non-adiabatic structures (and cooling histories)
for both Jupiter and Saturn are feasible. The interior temperatures in that
case are much higher that for standard adiabatic models. We conclude that the
internal structure is directly linked to the formation and evolution history of
the planet. These alternative internal structures of Jupiter and Saturn should
be considered when interpreting the upcoming Juno and Cassini data.

walks on Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi networks are presented. Starting from a random
initial node, a random walker hops between adjacent nodes until it hits a node
which it has already visited before. At this point, the path terminates. The
path length, namely the number of steps, $d$, pursued by the random walker from
the initial node up to its termination is called the first hitting time or the
first intersection length. Using recursion equations, we obtain analytical
results for the tail distribution of the path lengths, $P(d > \ell)$. The
results are found to be in excellent agreement with numerical simulations. It
is found %turns out that the distribution $P(d > \ell)$ follows a product of an
exponential distribution and a Rayleigh distribution. The mean, median and
standard deviation of this distribution are also calculated, in terms of the
network size and its mean degree. The termination of an RW path may take place
either by backtracking to the previous node or by retracing of its path, namely
stepping into a node which has been visited two or more time steps earlier. We
obtain analytical results for the probabilities, $p_b$ and $p_r$, that the
cause of termination will be backtracking or retracing, respectively. It is
shown that in dilute networks the dominant termination scenario is backtracking
while in dense networks most paths terminate by retracing. We also obtain
expressions for the conditional distributions $P(d=\ell | b)$ and $P(d=\ell |
r)$, for those paths which are terminated by backtracking or by retracing,
respectively. These results provide useful insight into the general problem of
survival analysis and the statistics of mortality rates when two or more

also find situations where earlier/shallower layers of CNN provide higher

  uniform diffusions",,,,,"math.PR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  It is known since Kellerer (1972) that for any process that is increasing for
the convex order, or ""peacock"" as in Hirsch et al. 2011, there exist
martingales with the same marginals laws. Nevertheless, there is no general
constructive method for finding such martingales that yields diffusions. We
consider the uniform peacock, namely the peacock with uniform law at all times
on a generic time-varying support [a(t); b(t)]. We derive explicitly the
corresponding SDEs and prove that, under certain ""conic"" conditions on a(t) and
b(t), they admit a unique strong diffusive solution. To guess the candidate SDE
we resort to the approach of inverting the Fokker Planck equation. Dupire
(1994) did this for volatility modeling. Here we tackle the inversion with the
caveats needed when dealing with uniform margins with conic boundaries. This
was done originally in the unpublished preprint by Brigo (1999). Independently,
Madan and Yor (2002) obtained the result as a simple application of Dupire.
Once the SDE is guessed, we analyze it rigorously, discussing the cases where
our approach adds strong uniqueness of the solution of the SDE and cases where
only a weak solution is obtained. We further study the local time and activity
of the solution. We then study the peacock with uniform law at all times on a
constant support [-1; 1] and derive the SDE of an associated mean-reverting
diffusion process with uniform margins that is not a martingale. For the
related SDE we prove existence of a solution. We derive the exact transition
densities for both the mean reverting and the original conic martingale cases.
We prove limit-laws and ergodic results: the SDE solution transition law tends
to be uniform after a long time. Finally, we provide a numerical study
confirming the desired uniform behaviour. These results may be used to model
random probabilities, recovery rates or correlations.

astrophysical phenomena, its effect is often not well understood. Furthermore,
direct numerical simulations are typically not able to reach the extreme
parameters of these processes. For this reason, large-eddy simulations (LES),
which only simulate large and intermediate scales directly, are employed. The
smallest, unresolved scales and the interactions between small and large scales
are introduced by means of a subgrid-scale (SGS) model. We propose and verify a
new set of nonlinear SGS closures for future application as an SGS model in LES
of compressible magnetohydrodynamics (MHD). We use 15 simulations (without
explicit SGS model) of forced, isotropic, homogeneous turbulence with varying
sonic Mach number $\mathrm{M_s} = 0.2$ to $20$ as reference data for the most
extensive \textit{a priori} tests performed so far in literature. In these
tests we explicitly filter the reference data and compare the performance of
the new closures against the most widely tested closures. These include
eddy-viscosity and scale-similarity type closures with different
normalizations. Performance indicators are correlations with the turbulent
energy and cross-helicty flux, the average SGS dissipation, the topological
structure and the ability to reproduce the correct magnitude and direction of
the SGS vectors. We find that only the new nonlinear closures exhibit
consistently high correlations (median value \textgreater$0.8$) with the data
over the entire parameter space and outperform the other closures in all tests.
Moreover, we show that these results are independent of resolution and chosen
filter scale. Additionally, the new closures are effectively coefficient-free
with a deviation of less than $20\%$.

Using a quantum-mechanical Hamiltonian formalism, we present a detailed
theoretical analysis of the conversion dynamics in these systems, and show that
they are capable of converting single- and multi-photon quantum states.
Analytic formulas for the conversion efficiency, spectral conversion
probability density, and pump power requirements are derived which are in good
agreement with previous theoretical and experimental results. We show that with
only modest improvement to the state of the art, efficiencies exceeding 95% are
achievable using less than 100 mW of pump power. At the critical driving
strength that yields maximum conversion efficiency, the spectral conversion
probability density is shown to exhibit a flat-topped peak, indicating a range
of insensitivity to the spectrum of a single photon input. Two alternate
theoretical approaches are presented to study the conversion dynamics: a
dressed mode approach that yields a better intuitive picture of the conversion
process, and a study of the temporal dynamics of the participating modes in the
resonator, which uncovers a regime of Rabi-like coherent oscillations of single
photons between two different frequency modes. This oscillatory regime arises
from the strong coupling of distinct frequency modes mediated by coherent
pumps.

services within the deployment environment are emulated by synthesising service
response messages from models or by recording and then replaying service
interaction messages with the system. Record-and-replay techniques require an
approach where (i) message prototypes can be derived from recorded system
interactions (i.e. request-response sequences), (ii) a scheme to match incoming
request messages against message prototypes, and (iii) the synthesis of
response messages based on similarities between incoming messages and the
recorded system interactions. Previous approaches in service virtualization
have required a multiple sequence alignment (MSA) algorithm as a means of
finding common patterns of similarities and differences between messages
required by all three steps.
  In this paper, we present a novel MSA algorithm based on Generalized Suffix
Trees (GSTs). We evaluated the accuracy and efficiency of the proposed
algorithm against six enterprise service message trace datasets, with the
proposed algorithm performing up to 50 times faster than standard MSA
approaches. Furthermore, the algorithm has applicability to other domains

across views among a large number of imposters. It typically involves two
procedures of non-linear feature extractions against dramatic appearance
changes, and subsequent discriminative analysis in order to reduce intra-
personal variations while enlarging inter-personal differences. In this paper,
we introduce a hybrid architecture which combines Fisher vectors and deep
neural networks to learn non-linear representations of person images to a space
where data can be linearly separable. We reinforce a Linear Discriminant
Analysis (LDA) on top of the deep neural network such that linearly separable
latent representations can be learnt in an end-to-end fashion. By optimizing an
objective function modified from LDA, the network is enforced to produce
feature distributions which have a low variance within the same class and high
variance between classes. The objective is essentially derived from the general
LDA eigenvalue problem and allows to train the network with stochastic gradient
descent and back-propagate LDA gradients to compute the gradients involved in
Fisher vector encoding. For evaluation we test our approach on four benchmark
data sets in person re-identification (VIPeR [1], CUHK03 [2], CUHK01 [3], and
Market1501 [4]). Extensive experiments on these benchmarks show that our model
can achieve state-of-the-art results.

ultra-dense deployment of BSs on the ASE scaling law. Specifically, it is

possible local non-linear distortions, and has been widely applied to audio,
video and graphics data alignments. DTW is essentially a point-to-point
matching method under some boundary and temporal consistency constraints.
Although DTW obtains a global optimal solution, it does not necessarily achieve
locally sensible matchings. Concretely, two temporal points with entirely
dissimilar local structures may be matched by DTW. To address this problem, we
propose an improved alignment algorithm, named shape Dynamic Time Warping
(shapeDTW), which enhances DTW by taking point-wise local structural
information into consideration. shapeDTW is inherently a DTW algorithm, but
additionally attempts to pair locally similar structures and to avoid matching
points with distinct neighborhood structures. We apply shapeDTW to align audio
signal pairs having ground-truth alignments, as well as artificially simulated
pairs of aligned sequences, and obtain quantitatively much lower alignment
errors than DTW and its two variants. When shapeDTW is used as a distance
measure in a nearest neighbor classifier (NN-shapeDTW) to classify time series,
it beats DTW on 64 out of 84 UCR time series datasets, with significantly
improved classification accuracies. By using a properly designed local
structure descriptor, shapeDTW improves accuracies by more than 10% on 18
datasets. To the best of our knowledge, shapeDTW is the first distance measure
under the nearest neighbor classifier scheme to significantly outperform DTW,
which had been widely recognized as the best distance measure to date. Our code
is publicly accessible at: https://github.com/jiapingz/shapeDTW.

generated from a coherent state of light. The system can exhibit polarization
entanglement if the two parts are distinguished by their parity, or parity
entanglement if the parts are distinguished by polarization. It was shown in
[PRL 110, 140404 (2013)] that this phenomenon can be exploited as a method to
test indistinguishability of two particles and it was conjectured that one can
also test indistinguishability of macroscopic systems. We propose a setup to
test this conjecture. Contrary to the previous studies using two-particle
interference effect as in Hong-Ou- Mandel setup, our setup neither assumes that
the tested state is composed of single particles nor requires that the total
number of particles be fixed. Consequently the notion of entanglement duality
is shown to be compatible with a broader class of physical systems. Moreover,
by observing duality in entanglement in the above system one can confirm that
macroscopic systems exhibit quantum behaviour. As a practical side,
entanglement duality is a useful concept that enables adaptive conversion of
entanglement of one degree of freedom (DOF) to that of another DOF according to
varying quantum protocols.

we propose to learn a deep convolutional neural network to rank photo
aesthetics in which the relative ranking of photo aesthetics are directly

meaningful photographic attributes and image content information which can help
regularize the complicated photo aesthetics rating problem.
  To train and analyze this model, we have assembled a new aesthetics and
attributes database (AADB) which contains aesthetic scores and meaningful
attributes assigned to each image by multiple human raters. Anonymized rater
identities are recorded across images allowing us to exploit intra-rater
consistency using a novel sampling strategy when computing the ranking loss of
training image pairs. We show the proposed sampling strategy is very effective
and robust in face of subjective judgement of image aesthetics by individuals
with different aesthetic tastes. Experiments demonstrate that our unified model
can generate aesthetic rankings that are more consistent with human ratings. To
further validate our model, we show that by simply thresholding the estimated
aesthetic scores, we are able to achieve state-or-the-art classification
performance on the existing AVA dataset benchmark.

kidney swap willing but incompatible donors. Determining an optimal set of
exchanges is theoretically and empirically hard. Traditionally, exchanges took
place in cycles, with each participating patient-donor pair both giving and
receiving a kidney. The recent introduction of chains, where a donor without a
paired patient triggers a sequence of donations without requiring a kidney in
return, increased the efficacy of fielded kidney exchanges---while also
dramatically raising the empirical computational hardness of clearing the
market in practice. While chains can be quite long, unbounded-length chains are
not desirable: planned donations can fail before transplant for a variety of
reasons, and the failure of a single donation causes the rest of that chain to
fail, so parallel shorter chains are better in practice.
  In this paper, we address the tractable clearing of kidney exchanges with
short cycles and chains that are long but bounded. This corresponds to the
practice at most modern fielded kidney exchanges. We introduce three new
integer programming formulations, two of which are compact. Furthermore, one of
these models has a linear programming relaxation that is exactly as tight as
the previous tightest formulation (which was not compact) for instances in
which each donor has a paired patient. On real data from the UNOS nationwide
exchange in the United States and the NLDKSS nationwide exchange in the United
Kingdom, as well as on generated realistic large-scale data, we show that our
new models are competitive with all existing solvers---in many cases
outperforming all other solvers by orders of magnitude.

discrimination, attributes shown to rely on an amplification process that
involves a mechanical as well as a biochemical response. Models that display
proximity to an oscillatory onset (a.k.a. Hopf bifurcation) exhibit a resonant
response to distinct frequencies of incoming sound, and can explain many
features of the amplification phenomenology. To understand the dynamics of this
resonance, frequency locking is examined in a system near the Hopf bifurcation
and subject to two types of driving forces: additive and parametric. Derivation
of a universal amplitude equation that contains both forcing terms enables a
study of their relative impact on the hair cell response. In the parametric
case, although the resonant solutions are 1:1 frequency locked, they show the
coexistence of solutions obeying a phase shift of $\pi$, a feature typical of
the 2:1 resonance. Different characteristics are predicted for the transition
from unlocked to locked solutions, leading to smooth or abrupt dynamics in
response to different types of forcing. The theoretical framework provides a
more realistic model of the auditory system, which incorporates a direct
modulation of the internal control parameter by an applied drive. The results
presented here can be generalized to many other media, including Faraday waves,
chemical reactions, and nonlinear optics, which are known to exhibit resonant
behavior.

This kind of results is well understood in the case of smooth test functions

total variation distance), a well known theorem due to Prohorov shows that some
regularity condition for the law of the random variables $Z_{i}$, $i\in

to discuss convergence in distribution norms, that is to replace the test
function $f$ by some derivative $\partial_{\alpha }f$ and to obtain upper
bounds for $\varepsilon_{n}(\partial_{\alpha }f)$ in terms of the infinite norm

perform some numerical experiments which confirm our theoretical result and we
study three physical phenomena : the evolution of water waves over a rough

biology by bioinformaticians. But these techniques have applications in other
fields, in particular in linguistics. Their main characteristics is to search
for relationships between the objects or species in study, instead of grouping
them by similarity. They are thus rather well suited for any kind of
evolutionary objects. For nearly fifteen years, astrocladistics has explored
the use of Maximum Parsimony (or cladistics) for astronomical objects like
galaxies or globular clusters. In this lesson we will learn how it works. 1 Why
phylogenetic tools in astrophysics? 1.1 History of classification The need for
classifying living organisms is very ancient, and the first classification
system can be dated back to the Greeks. The goal was very practical since it
was intended to distinguish between eatable and toxic aliments, or kind and
dangerous animals. Simple resemblance was used and has been used for centuries.
Basically, until the XVIIIth century, every naturalist chose his own criterion
to build a classification. At the end, hundreds of classifications were
available, most often incompatible to each other. The criteria for this
traditional way of classifying is the subjective appearance of the living
organisms. During the XVIIIth a revolution occurred. Scientists like Adanson
and Linn{\'e} devised new ways of classifying the objects and naming the
classes. Adanson realised that all the observable traits should be used, giving
birth to the mutivariate clustering and classification activity (Adanson,
1763). Linn{\'e} based his binomial nomenclature on neutral names unrelated
whatsoever to any property of the classes. We can realise the success of these
two ideas more than two centuries and a half later!

Telescope (WSRT) and the Karl Jansky Very Large Array (VLA), of a fast HI 21-cm
outflow in the ultra-luminous infrared galaxy Mrk 231. The outflow is observed
as shallow HI absorption blueshifted ~1300 km/s with respect to the systemic
velocity and located against the inner kpc of the radio source. The outflowing
gas has an estimated column density between 5 and 15x10^18 Tspin cm^-2. We
derive the Tspin to lie in the range 400-2000 K and the densities are
n_HI~10-100 cm^-3. Our results confirm the multiphase nature of the outflow in
Mrk231. Although effects of the interaction between the radio plasma and the
surrounding medium cannot be ruled out, the energetics and the lack of a clear
kpc-scale jet suggest that the most likely origin of the HI outflow is a
wide-angle nuclear wind, as earlier proposed to explain the neutral outflow
traced by NaI and molecular gas. Our results suggest that an HI component is
present in fast outflows regardless of the acceleration mechanism (wind vs jet
driven) and that it must be connected with common properties of the
pre-interaction gas. Considering the observed similarity of their column
densities, the HI outflow likely represents the inner part of the broad wind
identified on larger scales in NaI. The mass outflow rate of the HI outflow
does not appear to be as large as the one observed in molecular gas. These
characteristics suggest that the HI may represent a short intermediate phase in
the rapid cooling of the gas. We also obtained deeper continuum images than
previously available. At the resolution of ~1arcsec we do not see a kpc-scale
jet. Instead, we detect a plateau of emission, likely due to star formation,
surrounding the bright nuclear region. We also detect a poorly collimated
bridge which may represent the channel feeding the southern lobe.

groups of inputs into the unit (in particular, bottom-up inputs on one hand,
top-down inputs on the other hand) are consistent with each other, producing
the same contribution into the total weighted sum of inputs. In biological
terms, this would correspond to having each dendritic branch correctly
predicting the aggregate input from all the dendritic branches, i.e., the soma
potential. This is consistent with the prediction that the synaptic weights
into dendritic branches such as those of the apical and basal dendrites of
pyramidal cells are trained to minimize the prediction error made by the
dendritic branch when the target is the somatic activity. Whereas previous work
has shown how to achieve fast negative phase inference (when the model is
unclamped) in a predictive recurrent model, this contribution helps to achieve
fast positive phase inference (when the target output is clamped) in such
recurrent neural models.

stronger dawn-dusk asymmetry in response to changes in the geomagnetic

the oxygen ions show significant acceleration in the tail plasma sheet. Changes
in the SW dynamic pressure ($\mathit{P}_{dyn}$) affect the oxygen and proton
intensities in the same way. The energetic protons show significant intensity
increases at the near-Earth duskside during disturbed geomagnetic conditions,
enhanced SW $\mathit{P}_{dyn}$, and southward IMF, implying there location of
effective inductive acceleration mechanisms and a strong duskward drift due to
the increase of the magnetic field gradient in the near-Earth tail. Higher
losses of energetic ions are observed in the dayside plasma sheet under
disturbed geomagnetic conditions and enhanced SW $\mathit{P}_{dyn}$. These
observations are in agreement with theoretical models.

tight-binding model and the scattering-matrix method. It is interesting to find
that the band dispersion, conductance, and thermopower can be modulated by
applying a bias voltage and boundary potentials to the two layers of the ZPNRs.
Under the certain bias voltage, the two-fold degenerate quasi-flat edge bands
split perfectly. The conductance can be switched off, and the thermopower
around zero energy increases. In addition, when only the boundary potential of
the top layer or bottom layer is adjusted, only one edge band bends and merges
into the bulk band. The first conductance plateau is strongly decreased to
$e^2/h$ around zero energy. Particularly, when the two boundary potentials are
adjusted, all the edge bands bend and fully merge into the bulk band, and the
bulk energy gap is maximized. More interestingly, a pronounced conductance
plateau with $G=0$ is found around zero energy, which is attributable to the
opening of the bulk energy gap between the valence and conduction bands.
Meanwhile, the thermopower can be enhanced more than twice, compared to that of
the perfect ZPNRs. The large magnitude of thermopower is ascribed to the
appearance of the bulk energy gap around zero energy. Our results show that the
modulated ZPNRs are more reliable in thermoelectric application.

admits a reciprocal plasma resistance. Analogously, the microscopic

formulation is carried out in the frame of the grand canonical (for current
noise) and canonical (for voltage noise) ensembles and results are derived

Jeans' Theorem, the equilibrium distribution functions are expressed as
functions of the constants of motion, in the form of a Maxwellian multiplied by
an unknown function of the canonical momenta. In this case it is possible to
reduce the inverse problem to inverting Weierstrass transforms, which we
achieve by using expansions over Hermite polynomials. A sufficient condition on
the pressure tensor is found which guarantees the convergence and the
boundedness of the candidate solution, when satisfied. This condition is
obtained by elementary means, and it is clear how to put it into practice. We
also argue that for a given pressure tensor for which our method applies, there
always exists a positive distribution function solution for a sufficiently

of stochastic linear dynamic systems. For large systems, their evaluations are
time-consuming even for a single simulation. In such cases, uncertainty
quantification by crude Monte-Carlo simulation is not feasible. In this paper,
we propose the use of sparse adaptive polynomial chaos expansions (PCE) as a
surrogate of the full model. To overcome known limitations of PCE when applied
to FRF simulation, we propose a frequency transformation strategy that
maximizes the similarity between FRFs prior to the calculation of the PCE
surrogate. This strategy results in lower-order PCEs for each frequency.
Principal component analysis is then employed to reduce the number of random
outputs. The proposed approach is applied to two case studies: a simple 2-DOF
system and a 6-DOF system with 16 random inputs. The accuracy assessment of the
results indicates that the proposed approach can predict single FRFs
accurately. Besides, it is shown that the first two moments of the FRFs
obtained by the PCE converge to the reference results faster than with the
Monte-Carlo (MC) methods.

tensile strain so as to reduce the energy difference between its direct and
indirect band gaps. However, the conventional deformation potential model most
widely adopted to describe this transformation happens to have been
investigated only up to 1 % uniaxially loaded strains. In this work, we use a
micro-bridge geometry to uniaxially stress germanium along [100] up to
$\varepsilon_{100}$=3.3 % longitudinal strain and then perform
electro-absorption spectroscopy. We accurately measure the energy gap between
the conduction band at the $\Gamma$ point and the light- and heavy-hole valence
bands. While the experimental results agree with the conventional linear
deformation potential theory up to 2 % strain, a significantly nonlinear
behavior is observed at higher strains. We measure the deformation potential of
germanium to be a = -9.1 $\pm$ 0.3 eV and b = -2.32 $\pm$ 0.06 eV and introduce
a second order deformation potential. The experimental results are found to be
well described by tight-binding simulations. These new high strain coefficients

However, the Cassini spacecraft has shown that the shock standing in the solar
wind sunward of Saturn (Saturn's bow shock) can occasionally reach this
high-Mach number astrophysical regime. In this regime Cassini has provided the
first in situ evidence for electron acceleration under quasi-parallel upstream
magnetic conditions. Here we present the full picture of suprathermal electrons
at Saturn's bow shock revealed by Cassini. The downstream thermal electron
distribution is resolved in all data taken by the low-energy electron detector
(CAPS-ELS, <28 keV) during shock crossings, but the higher energy channels were
at (or close to) background. The high-energy electron detector (MIMI-LEMMS, >18
keV) measured a suprathermal electron signature at 31 of 508 crossings, where
typically only the lowest energy channels (<100 keV) were above background. We
show that these results are consistent with theory in which the ""injection"" of
thermal electrons into an acceleration process involves interaction with
whistler waves at the shock front, and becomes possible for all upstream
magnetic field orientations at high Mach numbers like those of the strong
shocks around young SNRs. A future dedicated study will analyze the rare

rational decisions on the outcome of the process. For instance, different
levels of trust in acquaintances do play a role in information spreading, and
actors may change their spreading decisions during the information diffusion
process accordingly. Here, we study an information-spreading model in which the
decision to transmit or not is based on trust. We explore the interplay between
the propagation of information and the trust dynamics happening on a two-layer
multiplex network. Actors' trustable or untrustable states are defined as
accumulated cooperation or defection behaviors, respectively, in a Prisoner's
Dilemma set up, and they are controlled by a memory span. The propagation of
information is abstracted as a threshold model on the information-spreading
layer, where the threshold depends on the trustability of agents. The analysis
of the model is performed using a tree approximation and validated on
homogeneous and heterogeneous networks. The results show that the memory of
previous actions has a significant effect on the spreading of information. For
example, the less memory that is considered, the higher is the diffusion.
Information is highly promoted by the emergence of trustable acquaintances.

identified as a function of distance and specific decoder implementation. The
four cases analyzed combine hard-decision (HD) or soft-decision (SD) decoding
together with either a bit-wise or a symbol-wise demapper, the last two
suitable for binary and nonbinary codes, respectively. The information rates
achievable for each scheme are calculated based on the mismatched decoder
principle. These quantities represent true indicators of the coded performance

switching from a symbol-wise to a bit-wise decoder results in a negligible

Galfenol Fe73Ga27 can be reproducibly switched between on and off states in a
low magnetic field of 20 to 30 mT at 10 K. The switching behavior is in
agreement with the magnetic field dependence of the magnetostriction inferred
from the magnetization behavior, causing a positive magnetostrictive strain
along the magnetic field. The repeated magneticfield cycling leads to a stable
contact geometry and to a robust contact configuration with a very low
hysteresis of 1 mT between opening and closing the contact due to a training
effect. Nonintegral multiples of the conductance quantum G0 observed for G is
greater than G0 are attributed to electron backscattering at defect sites in
the electrodes near the contact interface. When the contact is closed either

behavior below G0 due to electron tunneling. This allows to estimate the

attention has been given to the radial component of the Interplanetary Magnetic
Field (IMF). This study investigates the global auroral response in both
hemispheres when the IMF is southward and lies in the $\textit{xz}$ plane. We
present a statistical study of the average auroral response in the 12-24
magnetic local time (MLT) sector to an $\textit{x}$ component in the IMF. Maps
of auroral intensity in both hemispheres for two IMF $\mathit{B}_{x}$ dominated
conditions($ \pm $ IMF $\mathit{B}_{x}$) are shown during periods of negative
IMF $\mathit{B}_{z}$, small IMF $\mathit{B}_{y}$, and local winter. This is
obtained by using global imaging from the Wideband Imaging Camera on the IMAGE
satellite. The analysis indicates a significant asymmetry between the two IMF
$\mathit{B}_{x}$ dominated conditions in both hemispheres. In the Northern
Hemisphere the aurora is brighter in the 15-19 MLT region during negative IMF
$\mathit{B}_{x}$. In the Southern Hemisphere the aurora is brighter in the
16-20 MLT sector during positive IMF $\mathit{B}_{x}$. We interpret the results
in the context of a more efficient solar wind dynamo in one hemisphere. Both
the intensity asymmetry and its location are consistent with this idea. This
has earlier been suggested from case studies of simultaneous observations of
the aurora in both hemispheres, but hitherto never been observed to have a
general impact on global auroral brightness in both hemispheres from a
statistical study. The observed asymmetries between the two IMF
$\mathit{B}_{x}$ cases are not large; however, the difference is significant
with a 95% confidence level. As the solar wind conditions examined in the study
are rather common (37% of the time) the accumulative effect of this small
influence may be important for the total energy budget.

thermal motions are partly neglected in computer models of molecular

introduce a method for modelling interactions so that structural flexibility is
inherently taken into account. It has a statistical model for 3D properties of
'nonlocal' contacts and a physics based description of 'local' interactions,
based on mechanical torque. The form of the torque barrier is derived using a
representation of the local electronic structure, which is presumed to improve
transferability, compared to traditional force fields. The nonlocal contacts
are more distant than 1-4 interactions and Target-atoms are represented by 3D
probability densities. Probability mass quantifies strength of contact and is
calculated as an overlap integral. Repulsion is described by negative
probability density, allowing probability mass to be used as the descriptor of
contact preference. As a result, we are able to transform the high-dimensional
problem into a simpler evaluation of three-dimensional integrals. We outline
how this scoring function gives a tool to study the enthalpy--entropy
compensation and demonstrate the feasibility of our approach by evaluating
numerical probability masses for chosen side chain to main chain contacts in a

ongoing, vigorous star formation -- this claim is supported by strong magnetic

the electron population in the intergalactic bridge between member galaxies

The increase in the spin reorientation transition temperature in case of x =

from 643 K (x = 0) to 273 K (x = 0.5) can be ascribed to the decrease in the

overhauled the way permissions are granted by users, by switching to run-time

welcome change, but recent research has shown that many users continue to
accept run-time permissions blindly, leaving them at the mercy of third-party
app developers and adversaries. Beyond intentionally invading privacy, highly
privileged apps increase the attack surface of smartphones and are more
attractive targets for adversaries. This work focuses exclusively on dangerous

permissions used by Android apps when they are updated, to gain a greater
understanding of the evolution of permission usage. We found that approximately

made statistically significant observations that free apps and highly popular

theories, such as the principal chiral model on a Lie group $G$ or
$\sigma$-models on (semi-)symmetric spaces $G/F$. The deformation has the
effect of breaking the global $G$-symmetry of the original model, replacing the
associated set of conserved charges by ones whose Poisson brackets are those of
the $q$-deformed Poisson-Hopf algebra $\mathscr U_q(\mathfrak g)$. Working at
the Hamiltonian level, we show how this $q$-deformed Poisson algebra originates
from a Poisson-Lie $G$-symmetry. The theory of Poisson-Lie groups and their
actions on Poisson manifolds, in particular the formalism of the non-abelian
moment map, is reviewed. For a coboundary Poisson-Lie group $G$, this
non-abelian moment map must obey the Semenov-Tian-Shansky bracket on the dual
group $G^*$, up to terms involving central quantities. When the latter vanish,
we develop a general procedure linking this Poisson bracket to the defining
relations of the Poisson-Hopf algebra $\mathscr U_q(\mathfrak g)$, including
the $q$-Poisson-Serre relations. We consider reality conditions leading to $q$
being either real or a phase. We determine the non-abelian moment map for
Yang-Baxter type models. This enables to compute the corresponding action of
$G$ on the fields parametrising the phase space of these models.

obtained by the Cluster satellites during magnetopause traversals. Using a
combination of single-spacecraft and multispacecraft techniques, we calculated
macroscopic features such as thickness, location, and motion of the

significantly thicker than the dayside magnetopause and also possesses a
pronounced and persistent dawn-dusk asymmetry. Thicknesses vary from 150 to
5000 km, with an median thickness of around 1400 km at dawn and around 1150 km
at dusk. Current densities are on average higher on dusk, suggesting that the
total current at dawn and dusk are similar. Solar wind conditions and the
interplanetary magnetic field cannot fully explain the observed dawn-dusk
asymmetry. For a number of crossings we were also able to derive detailed
current density profiles. The profiles show that the magnetopause often
consists of two or more adjacent current sheets, each current sheet typically
several ion gyroradii thick and often with different current direction. This
demonstrates that the flank magnetopause has a structure that is more complex
than the thin, one-dimensional current sheet described by a Chapman-Ferraro

by means of steady-state and time-resolved photoluminescence spectroscopy.
While the emission properties of thin films and crystals appear relatively
similar at room temperature, low temperature photoluminescence spectroscopy
reveals striking differences between the two materials. Single crystals
photoluminescence exhibits a sharp excitonic emission at high energy, with Full
Width at Half Maximum of only 5 meV, assigned to free excitonic recombination
and a broad band at low energy. We analyzed the thermal evolution of the free
excitonic intensity and linewidth. An excitonic binding energy of 28 meV is
extracted from the quenching of the photoluminescence. We highlight a strong
broadening of the emission due to LO phonon coupling. The free excitonic
emission turned to be very short-lived with a sub-nanosecond dynamics, mainly
induced by the fast trapping of the excitons. The free excitonic emission is
completely absent of the thin films spectra, which are dominated by trap states

latitudes. From these magnetometers, the largest perturbation in the southward
direction is selected as the $\textit{ AL/SML }$ index at 1 min cadence. The
southward component is defined as antiparallel to the orientation of the
horizontal part of the Earths' main field, $\textbf{B}_{0, \textit{H}}$. The
implicit assumption when using these indices as a monitor of the westward
electrojet is that the electrojet flows perpendicular to $\textbf{B}_{0,

convert the components to a corrected geomagnetic system. This is most
important when considering longitudinal or UT variations, or when data from a

way using the gauge-gravity duality. In earlier calculations, the geometry in
the gravity side at finite temperature was usually taken as the pure AdS
blackhole metric for which the dual gauge theory becomes conformally invariant
unlike QCD. Therefore we use a metric which incorporates the fundamental quarks
by embedding the coincident D7 branes in the Klebanov-Tseytlin background and a
finite temperature is switched on by inserting a black hole into the
background, known as OKS-BH metric. Further inclusion of an additional UV cap
to the metric prepares the dual gauge theory to run similar to thermal QCD.
Moreover $\hat{q}$ is usually defined in the literature from the Glauber-model
perturbative QCD evaluation of the Wilson loop, which has no reasons to hold if
the coupling is large and is thus against the main idea of gauge-gravity
duality. Thus we use an appropriate definition of $\hat{q}$: $\hat{q} L^- =
1/L^2$, where $L$ is the separation for which the Wilson loop is equal to some
specific value. The above two refinements cause $\hat{q}$ to vary with the
temperature as $T^4$ always and to depend linearly on the light-cone time $L^-$
with an additional ($1/L^-$) correction term in the short-distance limit
whereas in the long-distance limit, it depends only linearly on $L^-$ with no
correction term. These observations agree with other holographic calculations
directly or indirectly.

still open to question. Similar in many aspects to common gamma-ray bursts
(GRBs), their strong X-ray emission is accompanied by very low or absent
emission in the gamma-ray band. Despite this key difference, a number of
indications have consolidated the idea that XRFs and GRBs share a common
origin, including a number of potential XRF/supernova associations and the
consistency of some XRFs with the Amati relation for long GRBs. However, the
difficulties in explaining XRFs as off-axis or intrinsically weak GRBs still
cast doubts on this interpretation. Here we explore the possibility that some
XRFs are instead powered by the spindown of a long-lived neutron star (NS)
formed in a binary NS (BNS) merger or, possibly, in a core-collapse supernova.
Focusing on XRF 020903 and a few other cases observed by HETE-2, we show that
their lack of gamma-ray emission, spectral properties, duration and X-ray
luminosity find a natural explanation within our hypothesis. Moreover, we point
out that the agreement of XRF 020903 with the Amati and Ghirlanda relations for
long GRBs is respectively only marginal and problematic. Assuming a BNS merger
origin for the long-lived NS, we use XRF observations to estimate a lower limit
on the rate of BNS mergers accompanied by a potentially observable XRF signal.
Within the reach of the advanced LIGO and Virgo gravitational wave detectors,
we find >0.02-0.05 1/yr. Finally, we discuss the implications of a supernova
association for the XRF events considered.

of the choice of a vector-valued Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space (RKHS) as a

distribution takes a power law form with an index of -2.16. We analyze the gas
geometry, N-PDF shape, and YSO content of a selection of subregions in the
cloud. We find no regions with pure lognormal N-PDFs. The regions with a
combination of lognormal and one power law N-PDF have a YSO cluster and a
corresponding centrally concentrated gas clump. The regions with a combination
of lognormal and two power law N-PDF have significant numbers of typically
younger YSOs but no prominent YSO cluster. These regions are composed of an
aggregate of closely spaced gas filaments with no concentrated dense gas clump.
We find that for our fixed scale regions, the YSO count roughly correlates with
the N-PDF power law index. The correlation appears steeper for single power law
regions relative to two power law regions with a high column density cut-off,

trigonometric parallax. The fit obtained using a uniform proper motion yields a
parallax $\varpi$ = 1.10 $\pm$ 0.18 mas, but with a fairly high post-fit

included, the quality of the fit improves dramatically, and the best estimate
of the parallax becomes $\varpi$ = 1.12 $\pm$ 0.05 mas. The magnitude of the
fitted acceleration suggest an orbital period of order a decade. The measured

convergent infinite series representation for the SWC output signal-noise ratio

the form of infinite series for the average error probability performance of
various modulation schemes for integer values of $m$ as well as the average
number of paths estimation and average waiting time (AWT) of $L$-branch SWC

shown that the performance expressions converge very fast to their exact

addition to the analytical results, complementary computer simulated
performance evaluation results have been obtained by means of Monte Carlo error
counting techniques. The match between these two sets of results has verified
the accuracy of the proposed mathematical analysis. Furthermore, it is revealed
that, at the expense of a negligible AWT, the average error probability
performance of SWC receivers is always superior to that of switched-and-examine

wide field (but relatively low resolution) part of the survey was provided by
15 nights of observation with the Murchison Widefield Array (MWA) over a period
of approximately a month, contemporaneous with K2 observations of the field.
The multi-resolution aspect of the survey was provided by the low resolution

The survey is therefore sensitive to the details of radio structures across a
wide range of angular scales. Consistent with other recent low radio frequency
surveys, no significant radio transients or variables were detected in the
survey. The resulting source catalogs consist of 1,085 and 1,468 detections in
the two MWA observation bands (centered at 154 and 185 MHz, respectively) and
7,445 detections in the GMRT observation band (centered at 148 MHz), over 314

extracted from stellar spectra constitute new tools for building the 3D
structure of the Galactic Interstellar Medium (ISM). The amount of details on
the structure depends directly on the quantity of available lines of sight
(LOS). Therefore there is a need to construct databases of high-quality DIB

catalog of high-quality measurements of the 1.5273 micron DIB towards a large

hot stars observed to correct for the telluric absorption and not used for ISM
studies so far. This catalog would complement the extensive database recently
extracted from the APOGEE observations and used for 3D ISM mapping. We devised
a method to fit the stellar continuum of the hot calibration stars and
extracted the DIB from the normalized spectrum. Severe selection criteria based
on the absorption characteristics are applied to the results. In particular
limiting constraints on the DIB widths and Doppler shifts are deduced from the
HI 21 cm measurements, following a new technique of decomposition of the
emission spectra. From ~16 000 available hot telluric spectra we have extracted
~ 6700 DIB measurements and their associated uncertainties. The statistical
properties of the extracted absorptions are examined and our selection criteria
are shown to provide a robust dataset. The resulting catalog contains the DIB
total equivalent widths, central wavelengths and widths. We briefly illustrate
its potential use for the stellar and interstellar communities.

for structure-preserving linearizations for symmetric and skew-symmetric matrix
polynomial than the one based on Fiedler pencils with repetition, we introduce
in this work the families of (modified) symmetric and skew-symmetric block
Kronecker pencils. These families provide a large arena of structure-preserving
strong linearizations of symmetric and skew-symmetric matrix polynomials. When
the matrix polynomial has degree odd, these linearizations are strong
regardless of whether the matrix polynomial is regular or singular, and many of
them give rise to structure-preserving companion forms. When some generic
nonsingularity conditions are satisfied, they are also strong linearizations
for even-degree regular matrix polynomials. Many examples of
structure-preserving linearizations obtained from Fiedler pencils with
repetitions found in the literature are shown to belong (modulo permutations)
to these families of linearizations. In particular, this is shown to be true
for the well-known block-tridiagonal symmetric and skew-symmetric companion
forms. Since the families of symmetric and skew-symmetric block Kronecker
pencils belong to the recently introduced set of minimal bases pencils
\cite{Fiedler-like}, they inherit all its desirable properties for numerical
applications. In particular, it is shown that eigenvectors, minimal indices,
and minimal bases of matrix polynomials are easily recovered from those of any

angular momentum ${\bf L}_{\rm N}$, to model inspiral gravitational waves from
generic spinning compact binaries. A key feature of such a precessing
convention is its ability to remove all spin precession induced modulations
from the orbital phase evolution. However, this convention usually employs a
post-Newtonian (PN) accurate precessional equation, appropriate for the PN
accurate orbital angular momentum ${\bf L}$, to evolve the ${\bf L}_{\rm
N}$-based precessing source frame. This motivated us to develop inspiral
waveforms for spinning compact binaries in a precessing convention that
explicitly use ${\bf L}$ to describe the binary orbits. Our approach introduces
certain additional 3PN order terms in the orbital phase and frequency evolution
equations with respect to the usual ${\bf L}_{\rm N}$-based implementation of
the precessing convention. The implications of these additional terms are
explored by computing the match between inspiral waveforms that employ ${\bf

estimates are smaller than the optimal value, namely 0.97, for a non-negligible

experimental evidence for contribution of drag of electrons by SPP to
thermoelectric phenomena in graphene: graphene thermopower exhibits good
agreement with Mott's law, which means that the diffusion contribution to the
thermopower is dominant in a wide range of carrier densities and temperatures.
Here we develop a complete theory of drag of electrons in graphene by SPP. By
solving Boltzmann transport equation for electrons scattered by SPPs we derive
SPP drag contribution to the thermopower in graphene. Compared to diffusion
thermopower, obtained values appear to be one order of magnitude lower for
various substrates. This can be explained by low occupation number of the SPPs

$U:=\{ y:E(t,y) \wedge y' \neq 0 \}$ where $t$ is an element with $t'=1$. We
show that certain types of predimension inequalities imply strong minimality

Light-curve Analysis"" (JLA) supernova (SN) data by using an improved
flux-averaging (FA) technique, in which only the type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) at
high redshift are flux-averaged. Adopting the criterion of figure of Merit
(FoM) and considering six dark energy (DE) parameterizations, we search the
best FA recipe that gives the tightest DE constraints in the $(z_{cut}, \Delta
z)$ plane, where $z_{cut}$ and $\Delta z$ are redshift cut-off and redshift
interval of FA, respectively. Then, based on the best FA recipe obtained, we
discuss the impacts of varying $z_{cut}$ and varying $\Delta z$, revisit the
evolution of SN color luminosity parameter $\beta$, and study the effects of
adopting different FA recipe on parameter estimation. We find that: (1) The
best FA recipe is $(z_{cut} = 0.6, \Delta z=0.06)$, which is insensitive to a
specific DE parameterization. (2) Flux-averaging JLA samples at $z_{cut} \geq
0.4$ will yield tighter DE constraints than the case without using FA. (3)
Using FA can significantly reduce the redshift-evolution of $\beta$. (4) The
best FA recipe favors a larger fractional matter density $\Omega_{m}$. In
summary, we present an alternative method of dealing with JLA data, which can
reduce the systematic uncertainties of SNe Ia and give the tighter DE
constraints at the same time. Our method will be useful in the use of SNe Ia
data for precision cosmology.

number of Mercury-crossing asteroids with perihelia less than 0.3 AU. At small
heliocentric distances, these objects may begin to lose mass, thus becoming
""active asteroids"" with comet-like comae or tails. This paper assembles a
database of 97 known Mercury-crossing asteroids that may be encountered by SPP,
and it presents estimates of their time-dependent visible-light fluxes and mass
loss rates. Assuming a similar efficiency of sky background subtraction as was
achieved by STEREO, we find that approximately 80% of these asteroids are
bright enough to be observed by the Wide-field Imager for SPP (WISPR). A model
of gas/dust mass loss from these asteroids is developed and calibrated against
existing observations. This model is used to estimate the visible-light fluxes
and spatial extents of spherical comae. Observable dust clouds occur only when
the asteroids approach the Sun closer than 0.2 AU. The model predicts that
during the primary SPP mission between 2018 and 2025, there should be 113
discrete events (for 24 unique asteroids) during which the modeled comae have
angular sizes resolvable by WISPR. The largest of these correspond to asteroids
3200 Phaethon, 137924, 155140, and 289227, all with angular sizes of roughly 15

  An EKF using a parameterised 2-D spectral-Galerkin model with ITD measurement

predict the core temperature and multiple surface temperatures of a 32113
LiFePO$_4$ cell, using current excitation profiles based on an Artemis HEV
drive cycle. The method is validated experimentally on a cell fitted with a
heat sink and asymmetrically cooled via forced air convection.
  A novel approach to impedance-temperature calibration is also presented,
which uses data from a single drive cycle, rather than measurements at multiple
uniform cell temperatures as in previous studies. This greatly reduces the time
required for calibration, since it overcomes the need for repeated cell thermal
equalization.

ultra-strong and extremely robust, despite it being merely
interfacially-induced, with neither graphene nor the TMD substrates changing
their structure. This is found to be the case irrespective of the TMD material
used, of the transport regime, of the carrier type in the graphene band, and of
the thickness of the graphene multilayer. Specifically, we perform weak
antilocalization measurements as the simplest and most general diagnostic of
SOI, and show that the spin relaxation time is very short in all cases
regardless of the elastic scattering time. Such a short spin-relaxation time
strongly suggests that the SOI originates from a modification of graphene band
structure. We confirmed this expectation by measuring a gate-dependent beating,
and a corresponding frequency splitting, in the low-field Shubnikov-de Haas
magneto-resistance oscillations in high quality bilayer graphene on WSe$_2$.
These measurements provide an unambiguous diagnostic of a SOI-induced splitting
in the electronic band structure, and their analysis allows us to determine the
SOI coupling constants for the Rashba term and the so-called spin-valley
coupling term, i.e., the terms that were recently predicted theoretically for
interface-induced SOI in graphene. The magnitude of the SOI splitting is found
to be on the order of 10 meV, more than 100 times greater than the SOI
intrinsic to graphene. Both the band character of the interfacially induced
SOI, as well as its robustness and large magnitude make graphene-on-TMD a

nuclear norm regularization. However, we will see that the approximations

Deligne--Lusztig varieties attached to division algebras over local fields. We
also prove the two conjectures of Boyarchenko on these varieties. It is known
that in this setting, the semi-infinite Deligne--Lusztig varieties are
ind-schemes comprised of limits of certain finite-type schemes $X_h$.
Boyarchenko's two conjectures are on the maximality of $X_h$ and on the
behavior of the torus-eigenspaces of their cohomology. Both of these
conjectures were known in full generality only for division algebras with Hasse
invariant $1/n$ in the case $h = 2$ (the ""lowest level"") by the work of
Boyarchenko--Weinstein on the cohomology of a special affinoid in the
Lubin--Tate tower. We prove that the number of rational points of $X_h$ attains
its Weil--Deligne bound, so that the cohomology of $X_h$ is pure in a very
strong sense. We prove that the torus-eigenspaces of $H_c^i(X_h)$ are
irreducible representations and are supported in exactly one cohomological
degree. Finally, we give a complete description of the homology groups of the
semi-infinite Deligne--Lusztig varieties attached to any division algebra, thus
giving a geometric realization of the unramified supercuspidal representations
of these groups. We expect that the techniques developed in this paper will be
useful in studying these constructions for reductive groups over local fields
in general.

variables that must be considered jointly in order to be more representative of
the nature of these phenomena. For such events, identification of extremes is
inappropriate if it is based on marginal analysis. Extremes have usually been
linked to the notion of quantile, which is an important tool to analyze risk in
the univariate setting. We propose to identify multivariate extremes and
analyze environmental phenomena in terms of the directional multivariate
quantile, which allows us to analyze the data considering all the variables
implied in the phenomena, as well as look at the data in interesting directions
that can better describe an environmental catastrophe. Since there are many
references in the literature that propose extremes detection based on copula
models, we also generalize the copula method by introducing the directional
approach. Advantages and disadvantages of the non-parametric proposal that we
introduce and the copula methods are provided in the paper. We show with
simulated and real data sets how by considering the first principal component
direction we can improve the visualization of extremes. Finally, two cases of
study are analyzed: a synthetic case of flood risk at a dam (a 3-variable
case), and a real case study of sea storms (a 5-variable case).

for statistical estimation in high-dimensional problems such as compressed
sensing and low-rank matrix estimation. This paper analyzes the performance of
AMP in the regime where the problem dimension is large but finite. For
concreteness, we consider the setting of high-dimensional regression, where the
goal is to estimate a high-dimensional vector $\beta_0$ from a noisy
measurement $y=A \beta_0 + w$. AMP is a low-complexity, scalable algorithm for
this problem. Under suitable assumptions on the measurement matrix $A$, AMP has
the attractive feature that its performance can be accurately characterized in
the large system limit by a simple scalar iteration called state evolution.
Previous proofs of the validity of state evolution have all been asymptotic
convergence results. In this paper, we derive a concentration inequality for
AMP with i.i.d. Gaussian measurement matrices with finite size $n \times N$.
The result shows that the probability of deviation from the state evolution
prediction falls exponentially in $n$. This provides theoretical support for
empirical findings that have demonstrated excellent agreement of AMP
performance with state evolution predictions for moderately large dimensions.
The concentration inequality also indicates that the number of AMP iterations
$t$ can grow no faster than order $\frac{\log n}{\log \log n}$ for the
performance to be close to the state evolution predictions with high
probability. The analysis can be extended to obtain similar non-asymptotic
results for AMP in other settings such as low-rank matrix estimation.

unable to predict the spatially resolved temperature distribution throughout

full temperature distribution with a similar efficiency to a TEC. The model
accounts for transient heat generation, anisotropic heat conduction, and
non-homogeneous convection boundary conditions. The accuracy of the model is
validated through comparison with finite element simulations, which show that
the 2-D temperature field (r, z) of a large format (64 mm diameter) cell can be
accurately modelled with as few as 4 states. Furthermore, the performance of
the model for a range of Biot numbers is investigated via frequency analysis.
For larger cells or highly transient thermal dynamics, the model order can be
increased for improved accuracy. The incorporation of this model in a state

of numbers in real-life data is proportioned between all possible 1 to 9 digits
approximately as in LOG(1 + 1/digit), so that low digits occur much more
frequently than high digits in the first place. The two essential prerequisites
for data configuration with regards to compliance with Benford's Law are high
order of magnitude and positive skewness with a tail falling to the right of
the histogram, so that quantitative configuration is such that the small is
numerous and the big is rare. In this article various quantitative partition
models are examined in terms of the quantitative and digital behavior of the
resultant set of parts. The universal feature found across all partition models
is having many small parts but only very few big parts, while Benford's Law is
valid only in some particular partition cases and under certain constraints.
Hence another suggested vista of Benford's Law is viewing it as a particular
subset of the broader positive skewness phenomenon in quantitative
partitioning. Significantly, such a vista is true in all other causes and
explanations of Benford's Law where the small consistently outnumbers the big
also in partial structures of the model or well before full convergence to
Benford is achieved - endowing the principle universality in a sense. In
conclusion, either the active act of partitioning or the passive consideration
of a large quantity as the composition of smaller parts can be considered as
another independent explanation for the widespread empirical observation of
Benford's Law in the physical sciences.

correct, we show that the Ellis wormhole reduces to Schwarzschild black hole
\textit{only} when the Ellis solution parameter $\gamma $ assumes a complex
value $-i$. We shall then reexamine stability of Ellis and phantom wormholes
from the viewpoint of local and asymptotic observers by using a completely
different approach, viz., we adapt Tangherlini's nondeterministic, prequantal
statistical simulation about photon motion in the real optical medium to an
effective medium reformulation of motions obtained via Hamilton's
optical-mechanical analogy in a gravity field. A crucial component of
Tangherlini's idea is the observed increase of momentum of the photons entering
a real medium. We show that this fact has a heuristic parallel in the effective
medium\ version of the Pound-Rebka experiment in gravity. Our conclusion is
that there is a non-zero probability that Ellis and phantom wormholes could
appear stable or unstable depending on the location of observers and on the
values of $\gamma$, leading to the possibility of \textit{ghost wormholes}
(like ghost stars). The Schwarzschild horizon, however, would always appear
certainly stable ($R=1$, $T=0$) to observers regardless of their location.
Phantom wormholes of bounded mass in the extreme limit $a\rightarrow -1$ are
also shown to be stable just as the Schwarzschild black hole is. We shall

gravity, it is most likely to be unstable to perturbations. Hence, we consider
a situation, where a phantom wormhole is somehow trapped inside a Schwarzschild

Visser (GLV), we shall exemplify that the shell can possess zones of stability
depending on certain constraints. It turns out that zones corresponding to
