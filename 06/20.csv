galaxy in a large spectroscopic sample of Sloan Digital Sky Survey galaxies. We
then characterize the local environment of each galaxy by using the number of
galaxies within 2 Mpc and by determining the isolation of the galaxy pair from
other neighbouring galaxies. We introduce a sophisticated algorithm for
creating a statistical control sample for each galaxy, matching on stellar
mass, redshift, local density and isolation. Unlike traditional studies of
close galaxy pairs, this approach is effective in a wide range of environments,
regardless of how far away the closest companion is (although a very distant
closest companion is unlikely to have a measurable influence on the galaxy in
question). We apply this methodology to measurements of galaxy asymmetry, and
find that the presence of nearby companions drives a clear enhancement in
galaxy asymmetries. The asymmetry excess peaks at the smallest projected
separations (< 10 kpc), where the mean asymmetry is enhanced by a factor of 2.0
$\pm$ 0.2. Enhancements in mean asymmetry decline as pair separation increases,
but remain statistically significant (1-2$\sigma$) out to projected separations
of at least 50 kpc.

simple and efficient for smaller networks. However, when the network is large
with sparse nodes, the routing information becomes more complex making
cluster-based techniques really relevant to tackle such situations. In a
cluster-based routing, all nodes in the network are dynamically organized into
partitions called groups or clusters. In each cluster, a cluster head is chosen
to help in the data transmission management and to maintain cluster membership

to use various ""group sparsity-inducing"" norms such as the Group LASSO norm for
this purpose. By using the theory of convex relaxations, we show that it is
also possible to use $\ell_1$-norm minimization for group sparse recovery. We
introduce a new concept called group robust null space property (GRNSP), and
show that, under suitable conditions, a group version of the restricted
isometry property (GRIP) implies the GRNSP, and thus leads to group sparse
recovery. When all groups are of equal size, our bounds are less conservative
than known bounds. Moreover, our results apply even to situations where where
the groups have different sizes. When specialized to conventional sparsity, our
bounds reduce to one of the well-known ""best possible"" conditions for sparse
recovery. This relationship between GRNSP and GRIP is new even for conventional
sparsity, and substantially streamlines the proofs of some known results. Using
this relationship, we derive bounds on the $\ell_p$-norm of the residual error
vector for all $p \in [1,2]$, and not just when $p = 2$. When the measurement
matrix consists of random samples of a sub-Gaussian random variable, we present
bounds on the number of measurements, which are less conservative than

results have serious implications for Internet privacy -- private attributes
can be inferred from users' publicly available data unless we take steps to
protect users from such inference attacks.
  To infer attributes of a targeted user, existing inference attacks leverage
either the user's publicly available social friends or the user's behavioral
records (e.g., the webpages that the user has liked on Facebook, the apps that
the user has reviewed on Google Play), but not both. As we will show, such
inference attacks achieve limited success rates. However, the problem becomes
qualitatively different if we consider both social friends and behavioral
records. To address this challenge, we develop a novel model to integrate
social friends and behavioral records and design new attacks based on our
model. We theoretically and experimentally demonstrate the effectiveness of our
attacks. For instance, we observe that, in a real-world large-scale dataset
with 1.1 million users, our attack can correctly infer the cities a user lived
in for 57% of the users, via confidence estimation, we are able to increase the
attack success rate to over 90% if the attacker selectively attacks a half of
the users. Moreover, we show that our attack can correctly infer attributes for
significantly more users than previous attacks.

be different from the previous clustering while fitting the data well. We
formalize this interaction in a Bayesian framework as a method for prior

outcome is often greatly different from the number of observations associated
with another discrete outcome. This situation is known as class-imbalance. In
statistics, one hypothesized explanation for class imbalance is the existence
of data generating processes that are characterized by asymmetric (as opposed
to typically symmetric) probability functions. Despite being a valid hypothesis
for class-imbalanced choice situations, few simple models exist for testing
this explanation in transportation settings---settings that are inherently
multinomial. Our paper fills this gap. As such, it should be of interest to
transportation scholars and practitioners alike.
  Overall, we addressed the following questions: ""how can one construct
asymmetric, closed-form, finite-parameter models of multinomial choice"" and
""how do such models compare against commonly used symmetric models?"" To do so,
we (1) introduced a new class of closed-form, finite-parameter, multinomial
choice models that we call ""logit-type models,"" (2) introduced a procedure for
using our logit-type models to extend existing binary choice models to the
multinomial setting, and (3) introduced a procedure for creating new binary
choice models (both symmetric and asymmetric). Together, our contributions
allow us to create new asymmetric, multinomial choice models by creating
multinomial extensions of asymmetric, binary choice models that already exist
or that we create ourselves. We demonstrated our methods by developing four new
asymmetric, multinomial choice models. We found that most of our asymmetric
models dominated the multinomial logit (MNL) model in terms of in-sample and
out-of-sample log-likelihoods. Moreover, on our two empirical applications, we
also found practical differences between the MNL model and our new asymmetric
models.

a single limiting resource coexist is a challenging issue within a theoretical
perspective. Previous investigations rely on mechanisms such as group or
spatial structuring to achieve a stable coexistence between competing metabolic
strategies. Nevertheless, coexistence has been experimentally reported even in
situations where it cannot be attributed to spatial effects [Heredity {\bf
100}, 471 (2008)]. According to that study a toxin expelled by one of the
strains can be responsible for the stable maintenance of the two strain types.
We propose a resource-based model in which an efficient strain with a slow
metabolic rate competes with a second strain type which presents a fast but
inefficient metabolism. Moreover, the model assumes that the inefficient strain
produces a toxin as a byproduct. This toxin affects the growth rate of both
strains with different strength. Through an extensive exploration of the
parameter space we determine the situations at which the coexistence of the two
strains is possible. Interestingly, we observe that the resource influx rate
plays a key role in the maintenance of the two strain types. In a scenario of
resource scarcity the inefficient is favored, though as the resource influx
rate is augmented the coexistence becomes possible and its domain is enlarged.

circuit design for achieving high accuracy and high yield as the process
technology advances. Existing statistical element selection (SES) design method
can improve transistor matching property, but it falls short of being a general
calibration method due to its limited calibration range. In this dissertation,
we propose a high resolution digital calibration method, called extended
statistical element selection (ESES). As compared to the SES method, the ESES
method not only provides wider calibration range, but also it results in higher
calibration yield with same calibration resolution target. Two types of ESES
based calibration application in analog/RF circuits are also proposed. One is
current source calibration and the other is phase/delay calibration. To verify
this proposed digital calibration method in circuit implementation, we
designed, fabricated and tested a wideband harmonic rejection receiver design.
The receiver utilizes ESES-based gain and phase error calibration for improving
harmonic rejection ratios. With the high calibration resolution provided by the
ESES method, after calibration, we achieved best-in-class harmonic rejection
ratios. To extend the application of the proposed method, we further designed a
current-steering D/A data converter (CS-DAC). The CS-DAC utilizes ESES-based
amplitude and timing error calibration for improving linearity performance.
Simulation results showed that we can achieve more than one order of magnitude
linearity improvement after performing ESES-based calibration in the CS-DAC.

synthetically generated by a quantum-accurate voltage-noise source is constant
to within 1 part in a billion for frequencies up to 1 GHz. Given this ratio,
and the values of other known or measured parameters, one can determine the
Boltzmann constant. Due, in part, to mismatch between transmission lines, the
experimental ratio spectrum varies with frequency. We model this spectrum as an
even polynomial function of frequency where the constant term in the polynomial
determines the Boltzmann constant. When determining this constant (offset) from
experimental data, the assumed complexity of the ratio spectrum model and the
maximum frequency analyzed (fitting bandwidth) dramatically affects results. We
select the complexity of the model by cross-validation. For each of many
fitting bandwidths, we determine the component of uncertainty of the offset
term that accounts for random and systematic effects associated with imperfect
knowledge of model complexity. We select the fitting bandwidth that minimizes
this uncertainty. In the most recent measurement of the Boltzmann constant,
results were determined, in part, by application of an earlier version of the
method described here. Here, we extend the earlier analysis by considering a
broader range of fitting bandwidths and quantify an additional component of
uncertainty that accounts for imperfect performance of our fitting bandwidth
selection method. For idealized simulated data our method correctly selects the
true complexity of the ratio spectrum model for all cases considered. A new
analysis of data from the recent experiment yields evidence for a temporal

starvation a population of unicellular amoebae splits between aggregators,
which form a fruiting body made of a stalk and resistant spores, and
non-aggregators. Spores are favored by long starvation periods, but vegetative
cells can exploit resources in fast-recovering environments. This partition can
be understood as a bet-hedging strategy that evolves in response to stochastic
starvation times. A genotype is defined by a different balance between each
type of cells. In this framework, if the ecological conditions are defined in
terms of the mean starvation time (i.e. time between onset of starvation and
the arrival of a new food pulse), a single genotype dominates each environment,
which is inconsistent with the huge genetic diversity observed in nature. We
investigate whether seasonality, represented by a periodic alternation in the
mean starvation times, allows the coexistence of several strategies. We use a
non-spatial (well-mixed) setting where different strains compete for a pulse of
resources. We find that seasonality, which we model via two seasons, induces a
temporal storage effect that can promote the stable coexistence of multiple
genotypes. Two conditions need to be met. First, the distributions of
starvation times in each season cannot overlap in order to create two well
differentiated habitats within the year. Second, numerous growth-starvation
cycles have to occur during each season to allow well-adapted strains to grow
and survive the subsequent unfavorable period. Additional tradeoffs among
life-history traits can expand the range of coexistence and increase the number
of coexisting strategies, contributing towards explaining the genetic diversity
observed in D. discoideum

discoideum includes a multicellular stage in which not necessarily clonal
amoebae aggregate upon starvation to form a possibly chimeric (genetically
heterogeneous) fruiting body made of dead stalk and spores. The lab-measured
reproductive skew in the spores of chimeras indicates strong social antagonism;
this should result in low genotypic diversity, which is inconsistent with
observations from nature. Two studies have suggested that this inconsistency
stems from the one-dimensional assessment of fitness (spore production) and
that the solution lies in tradeoffs between multiple traits, e.g.: spore size
versus viability; and staying vegetative versus becoming dormant. We
theoretically explore different tradeoff-implementing mechanisms and provide a
unifying ecological framework in which the two tradeoffs above, as well as
novel ones, arise collectively in response to characteristics of the
environment. We find that spore production comes at the expense of vegetative
cell production, time to development, and, depending on the experimental setup,
spore size and viability. Furthermore, we find that all existing experimental
results regarding chimeric mixes can be qualitatively recapitulated without
needing to invoke social interactions, which allows for simple resolutions to
previously paradoxical results. We conclude that the complexities of life
histories, including social behavior and multicellularity, can only be
understood in the appropriate multidimensional ecological context.

ion-ion interactions like metallic pores, i.e. that screening leads to an
exponential decay of the interaction potential with ion separation. By
introducing a quantum capacitance that accounts for the density of states in
the material, we show that ion-ion interactions in carbon nanotubes and
graphene slit pores actually decay algebraically with ion separation. This
result suggests a new avenue of capacitance optimization based on tuning the
electronic structure of a pore: a marked enhancement in capacitance might be
achieved by developing nanopores made with metallic materials or bulk
semimetallic materials.

framework, the parameters of the network are optimized to preserve underlying
manifold based relationships between speech feature vectors while minimizing a
measure of loss between network outputs and targets. This is achieved by
incorporating manifold based locality constraints in the objective criterion of
DNNs. Empirical evidence is provided to demonstrate that training a network
with manifold constraints preserves structural compactness in the hidden layers
of the network. Manifold regularization is applied to train bottleneck DNNs for
feature extraction in hidden Markov model (HMM) based speech recognition. The
experiments in this work are conducted on the Aurora-2 spoken digits and the
Aurora-4 read news large vocabulary continuous speech recognition tasks. The
performance is measured in terms of word error rate (WER) on these tasks. It is
shown that the manifold regularized DNNs result in up to 37% reduction in WER

original high-dimension feature vectors and meanwhile filter out irrelevant
noises. In this work, we present three different ways to apply the HOPE models
to CNNs, i.e., {\em HOPE-Input}, {\em single-HOPE-Block} and {\em
multi-HOPE-Blocks}. For {\em HOPE-Input} CNNs, a HOPE layer is directly used
right after the input to de-correlate high-dimension input feature vectors.
Alternatively, in {\em single-HOPE-Block} and {\em multi-HOPE-Blocks} CNNs, we
consider to use HOPE layers to replace one or more blocks in the CNNs, where
one block may include several convolutional layers and one pooling layer. The

the orthogonal constraints imposed by the HOPE layers can significantly improve

where the weights between input and hidden layer are initialized randomly. ELM
is efficient due to its utilization of the analytical approach to compute
weights between hidden and output layer. However, ELM still fails to output the
semantic classification outcome. To address such limitation, in this paper, we
propose a diversified top-k shapelets transform framework, where the shapelets
are the subsequences i.e., the best representative and interpretative features
of each class. As we identified, the most challenge problems are how to extract
the best k shapelets in original candidate sets and how to automatically
determine the k value. Specifically, we first define the similar shapelets and
diversified top-k shapelets to construct diversity shapelets graph. Then, a
novel diversity graph based top-k shapelets extraction algorithm named as
\textbf{DivTopkshapelets}\ is proposed to search top-k diversified shapelets.
Finally, we propose a shapelets transformed ELM algorithm named as
\textbf{DivShapELM} to automatically determine the k value, which is further
utilized for time series classification. The experimental results over public

traditional ELM algorithm in terms of effectiveness and efficiency.

different multicore architectures, and that different phases of an application
may have vastly different resource requirements, Pal et al. proposed a novel
reconfigurable hardware approach for executing multithreaded programs. Instead
of mapping a concurrent program to a fixed architecture, the architecture
adaptively reconfigures itself to meet the application's concurrency and
communication requirements, yielding significant improvements in performance.
Based on our earlier abstract operational framework for multicore execution
with hierarchical memory structures, we describe execution of multithreaded
programs on reconfigurable architectures that support a variety of clustered
configurations. Such reconfiguration may not preserve the semantics of programs
due to the possible introduction of race conditions arising from concurrent
accesses to shared memory by threads running on the different cores. We present
an intuitive partial ordering notion on the cluster configurations, and show
that the semantics of multithreaded programs is always preserved for
reconfigurations ""upward"" in that ordering, whereas semantics preservation for
arbitrary reconfigurations can be guaranteed for well-synchronised programs. We
further show that a simple approximate notion of efficiency of execution on the
different configurations can be obtained using the notion of amortised
bisimulations, and extend it to dynamic reconfiguration.

conflicting results which have appeared in the literature. Two previous surveys
for variability conducted with the Very Large Array (VLA) achieved a
sensitivity of 1mJy/beam. However, one survey found an areal density of radio
variables on timescales of decades that is a factor of ~4 times greater than a
second survey which was conducted on timescales of less than a few years. In
the Phoenix deep field we measure the density of variable radio sources to be
$\rho =0.98\mathrm{deg}^{-2}$ on timescales of 6 months to 8 years. We make use
of WISE infrared cross-ids, and identify all variable sources as an AGN of some
description. We suggest that the discrepancy between previous VLA results is
due to the different time scales probed by each of the surveys, and that radio
variability at 1.4 GHz is greatest on timescales of 2 - 5 years.

satisfying the color selection criteria, detected at S/N > 8 in F160W with M_AB
= -22.8 to -21.1 if at z = 10. Three of the six sources, including the two
brightest, are in a single WFC3 pointing (~ 4 arcmin^2), suggestive of
significant clustering, which is expected from bright galaxies at z ~ 10.
However, the two brightest galaxies are too extended to be likely at z ~ 10,

Typically, CCL requires several passes over the data. We focus on two-pass
technique where each pixel is given a provisional label in the first pass
whereas an actual label is assigned in the second pass.
  We present a scalable parallel two-pass CCL algorithm, called PAREMSP, which
employs a scan strategy and the best union-find technique called REMSP, which
uses REM's algorithm for storing label equivalence information of pixels in a
2-D image. In the first pass, we divide the image among threads and each thread
runs the scan phase along with REMSP simultaneously. In the second phase, we
assign the final labels to the pixels. As REMSP is easily parallelizable, we
use the parallel version of REMSP for merging the pixels on the boundary. Our
experiments show the scalability of PAREMSP achieving speedups up to $20.1$
using $24$ cores on shared memory architecture using OpenMP for an image of
size $465.20$ MB. We find that our proposed parallel algorithm achieves linear
scaling for a large resolution fixed problem size as the number of processing
elements are increased. Additionally, the parallel algorithm does not make use
of any hardware specific routines, and thus is highly portable.

deviation from a non-thermal power-law with a spectral index of $-0.74 \pm
0.02$. This spectral index is consistent with that derived at higher
frequencies, beneath 100 GHz, and with a shock in its adiabatic phase. A
spectral turnover due to free-free absorption by the circumstellar medium has
to occur below 72 MHz, which places upper limits on the optical depth of $\leq$
0.1 at a reference frequency of 72 MHz, emission measure of $\lesssim$ 13,000
cm$^{-6}$ pc, and an electron density of $\lesssim$ 110 cm$^{-3}$. This upper
limit on the electron density is consistent with the detection of prompt radio
emission and models of the X-ray emission from the supernova. The electron
density upper limit implies that some hydrodynamic simulations derived a red
supergiant mass loss rate that is too high, or a wind velocity that is too low.
The mass loss rate of $\sim 5 \times 10^{-6}$ $M_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$ and wind
velocity of 10 km s$^{-1}$ obtained from optical observations are consistent
with our upper limits, predicting a current turnover frequency due to free-free
absorption between 5 and 60 MHz.

reformulate them as mixed-integer linear programs (MILPs). However, the
computational time of such MILP reformulations grows dramatically, once the

approach is inspired by the Schmudgen's Positivstellensatz Theorem in
semi-algebraic geometry; but then we go through several steps based upon both
convex optimization and mixed-integer programming that results in obtaining
close to optimal bidding solutions, as evidenced by several numerical case
studies, besides having a huge advantage on reducing computation time. While
the computation time of the state-of-the-art MILP approach grows exponentially

index codelength that the sender sends. This paper considers unicast index
coding, where each receiver requests exactly one message, and each message is
requested by exactly one receiver. Each unicast index-coding instances can be
fully described by a directed graph and vice versa, where each vertex
corresponds to one receiver. For any directed graph representing a unicast
index-coding instance, we show that if a maximum acyclic induced subgraph
(MAIS) is obtained by removing two or fewer vertices from the graph, then the
minimum index codelength equals the number of vertices in the MAIS, and linear
codes are optimal for the corresponding index-coding instance. Using this
result, we solved all unicast index-coding instances with up to five receivers,
which correspond to all graphs with up to five vertices. For 9819
non-isomorphic graphs among all graphs up to five vertices, we obtained the
minimum index codelength for all message alphabet sizes; for the remaining 28

Arbabjolfaei et al. (ISIT 2013), who solved all unicast index-coding instances

the Rashba spin-orbit torque using Pt/Co/Pt trilayers with asymmetric

of the spin Hall torque, the complete cancelation of the spin Hall torque has
been verified by fabricating symmetric Pt/Co/Pt structure on SiO2 and Gd3Ga5O12

the spin Hall torque cannot be completely canceled out even when the top and
bottom Pt layers have same thicknesses on the SiO2 substrate, which suggests
that Pt/Co/Pt trilayers on a GGG substrate is a suitable system for precise
measurements of the spin Hall torque. The result of the vector measurements on
Pt/Co/Pt/GGG from 300 to 10 K shows that the spin Hall torque is almost
independent of temperature, which is quantitatively reproduced under the

whether a solution is the nucleolus in relatively small games (i.e., the number

form at spatial infinity. The action of three dimensional gravity theories can
be represented by a form including some auxiliary fields. As well-known

that is proportional to $$\frac{\det (\mathbf{G} \mathbf{G}^{\dagger})^{2 L}}
{\det(1_N+ \mathbf{G} \mathbf{G}^{\dagger})^{2(n+N+L)}}.$$ These matrices can
also be constructed via a procedure called `inducing', using a product of a
Wishart matrix (with parameters $n,N$) and a rectangular Ginibre matrix of size
$(N+L)\times N$. The inducing procedure imposes a repulsion of eigenvalues from
$0$ and $\infty$ in the complex plane, with the effect that in the limit of
large matrix dimension, they lie in an annulus whose inner and outer radii
depend on the relative size of $L$, $n$ and $N$.
  By using functional differentiation of a generalized partition function, we
make use of skew-orthogonal polynomials to find expressions for the eigenvalue
$m$-point correlation functions, and in particular the eigenvalue density
(given by $m=1$).
  We find the scaled limits of the density in the bulk (away from the real
line) as well as near the inner and outer annular radii, in the four regimes
corresponding to large or small values of $n$ and $L$. After a stereographic
projection the density is uniform on a spherical annulus, except for a
depletion of eigenvalues on a great circle corresponding to the real axis (as
expected for a real quaternion ensemble). We also form a conjecture for the
behaviour of the density near the real line based on analogous results in the
$\beta=1$ and $\beta=2$ ensembles; we support our conjecture with data from
Monte Carlo simulations of a large number of matrices drawn from the $\beta=4$

distributions of the EW(H$\alpha$) and D$_n(4000)$ on the NUV-r color-mass
diagram show clear trends that at a given stellar mass, galaxies with redder
NUV-r colors have smaller EW(H$\alpha$) and larger D$_n(4000)$. The reddest
adv-merger (U)LIRGs close to the green valley have D$_n(4000)$$>1.4$ mostly. In
addition, in the SFR-$M_{\ast}$ diagram, as the SFR decreases, the
EW(H$\alpha$) decreases and the D$_n(4000)$ increases, implying that the
adv-merger (U)LIRGs on the star formation main sequence have more evolved
stellar populations than those above the main sequence. These results indicate
that a fraction of the adv-merger (U)LIRGs have already exhibited signs of
fading from the starburst phase and that the NUV-r reddest adv-merger (U)LIRGs
are likely at the initial stage of post-starbursts with age of $\sim 1$ Gyr,
which is consistent with the gas exhausting time-scales. Therefore, our results
offer additional support for the fast evolutionary track from the blue cloud to
the red sequence.

adapts perfectly to the 'true OF' in the limit. This perfect OF is described by
a small number of parameters with straightforward geometric interpretation.
Applications are manifold: Quick expert marking of very poor quality (for

two-bridge knots, generalizing the one-parametric family of twist knots. In the
case of rectangular representations $R=[r^s]$ we found an evidence that the
corresponding differential expansion miraculously factorizes and can be
obtained from that for the twist knots. This reduces the problem of rectangular
exclusive Racah to constructing the answers for just a few twist knots. We
develop a recent conjecture on the structure of differential expansion for the

provide the exhaustive answer for the first unknown case of $R=[33]$. The
answer includes HOMFLY of arbitrary twist and double-braid knots and Racah

the single- and two-floor pyramids, the way to proceed is explicitly
illustrated by the examples of $R=[44]$ and $R=[55]$. This solves the difficult

the F\""orster resonance. In our experiments with a few cold Rb Rydberg atoms we
have found that the transients at the edges of the electric pulses strongly
affect the line shapes of the F\""orster resonances, since the population
transfer at the resonances occurs on a time scale of $\sim$100 ns, which is
comparable with the duration of the transients. For example, a short-term
ringing at a certain frequency causes additional radio-frequency-assisted
F\""orster resonances, while non-sharp edges lead to asymmetry. The intentional
application of the radio-frequency field induces transitions between collective
states, whose line shape depends on the interaction strengths and time. Spatial

space over time-invariant channels into fractional dimensions. As such,
multiple symbols can be simultaneously transmitted with fractional
degrees-of-freedom (DoF). Of particular interest is when the one dimensional
space is partitioned into two fractional dimensions. In such scenario, the
interfering signals are confined to one sub-space and the intended signal is
confined to the other sub-space. Existing real interference alignment schemes
achieve near-capacity performance at high SNR for time-invariant channels.
However, such techniques yield poor achievable rate at finite SNR, which is of
interest from a practical point of view. In this paper, we propose a radically
novel nonlinear interference alignment technique, which we refer to as
Interference Dissolution (ID). ID allows to break-up a one-dimensional space
into two fractional dimensions while achieving near-capacity performance for
the entire SNR range. This is achieved by aligning signals by signals, as
opposed to aligning signals by the channel. We introduce ID by considering a
time-invariant MISO channel. This channel has a one-dimensional space and
offers one DoF. We show that, by breaking-up the one dimensional space into two
sub-spaces, ID achieves a rate of two symbols per channel use while providing
$\frac{1}{2}$ DoF for each symbol. We analyze the performance of the proposed
ID scheme in terms of the achievable rate and the symbol error rate. In
characterizing the achievable rate of ID for the entire SNR range, we prove
that, assuming Gaussian signals, the sum achievable rate is at most one bit
away from the capacity. We present numerical examples to validate the
theoretical analysis. We also compare the performance of ID in terms of the
achievable rate performance to that of existing schemes and demonstrate ID's
superiority.

incompatible observables measured on a particle. The uncertainty lower bound
can be reduced by considering a particle as a quantum memory entangled with the
measured particle. In this paper, we consider a tripartite scenario in which a
quantum state has been shared between Alice, Bob, and Charlie. The aim of Bob
and Charlie is to minimize Charlie's lower bound about Alice's measurement
outcomes. To this aim, they concentrate their correlation with Alice in
Charlie's side via a cooperative strategy based on local operations and
classical communication. We obtain lower bound for Charlie's uncertainty about
Alice's measurement outcomes after concentrating information and compare it
with the lower bound without concentrating information in some examples. We
also provide a physical interpretation of the entropic uncertainty lower bound

series of characterization and classification theorems. The classical template
is Hadwiger's theorem, saying that every rigid motion invariant, continuous,
real-valued valuation on convex bodies in $\mathbb{R}^n$ is a linear
combination of the intrinsic volumes. For tensor-valued valuations, under the
assumptions of isometry covariance and continuity, there is a similar
classification theorem, due to Alesker. Also for the local extensions of the
intrinsic volumes, the support, curvature and area measures, there are
analogous characterization results, with continuity replaced by weak
continuity, and involving an additional assumption of local determination. The
present authors have recently obtained a corresponding characterization result
for local tensor valuations, or tensor-valued support measures (generalized
curvature measures), of convex bodies in $\mathbb{R}^n$. The covariance assumed
there was with respect to the group ${\rm O}(n)$ of orthogonal transformations.
This was suggested by Alesker's observation, according to which in dimensions
$n> 2$, the weaker assumption of ${\rm SO}(n)$ covariance does not yield more
tensor valuations. However, for tensor-valued support measures, the distinction
between proper and improper rotations does make a difference. The present paper
considers, therefore, the local tensor valuations sharing the previously
assumed properties, but with ${\rm O}(n)$ covariance replaced by ${\rm SO}(n)$
covariance, and provides a complete classification. New tensor valued support
measures appear only in dimensions two and three.

an accretion-jet model, consisting of an inner advection-dominated accretion
flow (ADAF), an outer truncated standard thin disk, and a jet. But model
degeneracy still exists in this framework. For example, the X-ray emission can
originate from either the ADAF or jet. The aim of the present work is to check
these models with the Faraday rotation measure (RM) observations recently
detected for two LLAGNs, M87 and 3C 84, in the sub-mm band. For M87, we find
that the RM predicted by the model in which the X-ray emission originates from
the ADAF is larger than the observed upper limit of RM by over two orders of
magnitude, while the model in which the X-ray emission originates from the jet
predicts a RM lower than the observed upper limit. For 3C 84, the sub-mm
emission is found to be dominated by the jet component, while the Faraday
screen is attributed to the ADAFs. This scenario can naturally explain the
observed {\it external} origin of the RM and why RM is found to be stable
during a two-year interval although the sub-mm emission increases at the same

been relying on the costly operation of channel state information (CSI)
acquisition and cumbersome phase shifters. Recent works have started to
investigate the possibility to use receivers based on energy detection (ED),
where a single data stream is decoded based on the channel and noise energy.
The asymptotic features of the massive receiver array lead to a system where
the impact of the noise becomes predictable due to a noise hardening effect.
This in effect extends the communication range compared to the receiver with a
small number of antennas, as the latter is limited by the unpredictability of
the additive noise. When the channel has a large number of spatial degrees of
freedom, the system becomes robust to imperfect channel knowledge due to
channel hardening. We propose two detection methods based on the instantaneous
and average channel energy, respectively. Meanwhile, we design the detection
thresholds based on the asymptotic properties of the received energy.
Differently from existing works, we analyze the scaling law behavior of the
symbol-error-rate (SER). When the instantaneous channel energy is known, the
performance of ED approaches that of the coherent detection in high SNR
scenarios. When the receiver relies on the average channel energy, our
performance analysis is based on the exact SER, rather than an approximation.
It is shown that the logarithm of SER decreases linearly as a function of the
number of antennas. Additionally, a saturation appears at high SNR for PAM
constellations of order larger than two, due to the uncertainty on the channel
energy. Simulation results show that ED, with a much lower complexity, achieves
promising performance both in Rayleigh fading channels and in sparse channels.

efficiency can be obtained by using local grid refinement, since the solution
is generally smooth in large parts of the domain and large gradients occur only
locally. Fast evaluation of integral transforms on such an adaptive grid
requires an algorithm that relies on the smoothness of the continuum kernel
only, independent of its discrete form. A multilevel algorithm with this
property was presented in [A. Brandt and C.H. Venner, SIAM J. Sci. Stat.
Comput. 19 (1998) pp.468-492] [Bra1998]. Ref. [Bra1998] shows that already on a
uniform grid the new algorithm is more efficient than earlier fast evaluation
algorithms, and elaborates the application to one-dimensional transforms. The
present work analyses the extension and implementation of the algorithm for
multidimensional transforms. The analysis conveys that the multidimensional
extension is nontrivial, on account of the occurence of nonlocal corrections.
However, by virtue of the asymptotic smoothness properties of the continuum
kernel, these corrections can again be evaluated fast. By recursion, it is then
possible to obtain the optimal work estimates indicated in [Bra1998].
Currently, only uniform grids are considered. Detailed numerical results will
be presented for a two dimensional model problem. The results demonstrate that
with the new algorithm the evaluation of multidimensional transforms is also
more efficient than with previous algorithms.

processing of information within a distributed computational medium. We explore
whether the Majority Problem can be approximated in a similarly simple

initial pattern of discrete voting choices is represented by spatial
arrangement of the agent population, temporarily held in-place by an attractant
stimulus. When this stimulus is removed the model adapts its shape and size,
moving to form a minimal distance connecting line. The final position of this
line is shown, in simple examples, to successfully represent the majority vote
decision, and also accurately reflects the size of the majority. We note
properties, limitations and potential improvements to the approach before
returning full-circle by re-encoding this morphological adaptation approach in

stellar metallicity relation for galaxies above 1e10 solar masses, including
Brightest Cluster Galaxies. Model disks, galaxies dominated by
instability-driven components, and merger-driven objects each stem from
different evolutionary channels. These model galaxies therefore occupy
different loci in the galaxy mass-size relation, which we find to be in accord
with the Atlas 3D classification of disk galaxies, fast rotators and slow
rotators. We find that the stellar populations' properties depend on the galaxy
evolutionary type, with more evolved stellar populations being part of systems

notably for the study of complex media. We here demonstrate the passive
measurement of time-dependent Green's functions between every point at the
surface of a strongly scattering medium by means of low coherence
interferometry. The experimental access to this Green's matrix is essential
since it contains all the information about the complex trajectories of light
within the medium. In particular, the spatio-temporal spreading of the
diffusive halo and the coherent backscattering effect can be locally
investigated in the vicinity of each point acting as a virtual source. On the
one hand, this approach allows a quantitative imaging of the diffusion constant
in the scattering medium with a spatial resolution of the order of a few
transport mean free paths. On the other hand, our approach is able to reveal
and quantify the anisotropy of light diffusion, which can be of great interest
for optical characterization purposes. This study opens important perspectives
both in optical diffuse tomography with potential applications to biomedical
imaging and in fundamental physics for the experimental investigation of
Anderson localization.

two-spot and evolving single spot models in the framework of a Bayesian Monte
Carlo Markov Chain approach to derive the a posteriori distribution of the
starspot parameters and the inclination of the star rotation axis. We focus on
the rotation periods of the spots that can provide evidence for differential
rotation in those stars. We find meaningful results in the case of three stars
with an inclination higher than 50 deg and a slow variation of the light curve
amplitude. The relative difference of the spot rotation periods ranges from
0.02 to 0.05 that is 3-10 times larger than the amplitude of the differential
rotation found in similar stars with Doppler imaging techniques. We conclude
that the intrinsic starspot evolution, although very slow, has a significant

$p_{\mathrm{T}}$ region ($3 < p_{\mathrm{T}} < 6$ GeV/$c$), particles group at
an approximate level according to the number of constituent quarks, suggesting
that coalescence might be the relevant particle production mechanism in this
region. The results for $p_{\mathrm{T}} < 3$ GeV/$c$ are described fairly well

the comparison to the AMPT model highlights the importance of the late hadronic

pulses in randomly structured plasmas mimicking the highly inhomogeneous solar
corona. A network of secondary waves is formed by a series of partial
reflections and transmissions. These secondary waves exhibit
quasi-periodicities in both time and space. Since the temporal and spatial
periods are related simply through the fast wave speed, we quantify the
properties of secondary waves by examining the dependence of the average
temporal period ($\bar{p}$) on the initial pulse width ($w_0$) as well as the
density contrast ($\delta_\rho$) and correlation length ($L_c$) that
characterize the randomness of the equilibrium density profiles. For
small-amplitude pulses, $\delta_\rho$ does not alter $\bar{p}$ significantly.
Large-amplitude pulses, on the other hand, enhance the density contrast when
$\delta_\rho$ is small but have a smoothing effect when $\delta_\rho$ is
sufficiently large. We found that $\bar{p}$ scales linearly with $L_c$ and that
the scaling factor is larger for a narrower pulse. However, in terms of the
absolute values of $\bar{p}$, broader pulses generate secondary waves with
longer periods, and this effect is stronger in random plasmas with shorter
correlation lengths. Secondary waves carry the signatures of both the leading
wave pulse and background plasma, our study may find applications in MHD
seismology by exploiting the secondary waves detected in the dimming regions

and loop, like in process mining. However, we do not look at start-to-end
models, which distinguishes our approach from process discovery and creates a
link to episode / sequential pattern mining. We propose an incremental
procedure for building local process models capturing frequent patterns based
on so-called process trees. We propose five quality dimensions and
corresponding metrics for local process models, given an event log. We show
monotonicity properties for some quality dimensions, enabling a speedup of
local process model discovery through pruning. We demonstrate through a real
life case study that mining local patterns allows us to get insights in
processes where regular start-to-end process discovery techniques are only able
to learn unstructured, flower-like, models.

main drivers for this paper are complexity of the modeling task, the large user
community, and the massive effort that has gone into SME.
  Aims. We do not intend to give a comprehensive introduction to stellar
atmospheres, but will describe changes to key components of SME: the equation
of state, opacities, and radiative transfer. We will describe the analysis and
fitting procedure and investigate various error sources that affect inferred
parameters.
  Methods. We review the current status of SME, emphasizing new algorithms and
methods. We describe some best practices for using the package, based on
lessons learned over two decades of SME usage. We present a new way to assess
uncertainties in derived stellar parameters.
  Results. Improvements made to SME, better line data, and new model
atmospheres yield more realistic stellar spectra, but in many cases systematic
errors still dominate over measurement uncertainty. Future enhancements are
outlined.

modulated spin cycloid structure of BiFeO3 is stable down to 4.2 K, whereas DC
[M(T)] and AC [\c{hi} ({\omega}, T)] magnetization, and caloric studies have
revealed several magnetic transitions including a spin glass transition around
25 K. The two sets of observations are irreconcilable and to settle this, it is
important to first verify if the low temperature magnetic transitions are
intrinsic to BiFeO3 or some of them are offshoots of oxygen vacancies and the
associated redox reaction involving conversion of Fe3+ to Fe2+. We present here
the results of M (T) and \c{hi} ({\omega}, T) measurements on pure and 0.3 wt%
MnO2 doped BiFeO3 samples in the 2 to 300 K temperature range. It is shown that
MnO2 doping increases the resistivity of the samples by three orders of
magnitude as a result of reduced oxygen vacancy concentration. A comparative
study of the M (T) and AC \c{hi} ({\omega}, T) results on two types of samples
reveals that the transitions around 25 K, 110 K and 250 K may be intrinsic to
BiFeO3. The widely reported transition at 50 K is argued to be defect induced,
as it is absent in the doped samples. We also show that the spin glass
transition temperature TSG is less than the spin glass freezing temperature
(Tf), as expected for both canonical and cluster glasses, in marked contrast to
an earlier report of TSG > Tf which is unphysical. We have also observed a cusp
corresponding to the spin glass freezing at Tf in ZFC M (T) data not observed
so far by previous workers. We argue that the ground state of BiFeO3 consists
of the coexistence of the spin glass phase with the long range ordered AFM
phase with a cycloidal spin structure.

It is remarkable that he was able to derive expressions for all phase space
symmetry generators without making explicit reference to the generator of time
evolution. In his Applications, Rosenfeld treated the general relativistic
example of Einstein-Maxwell-Dirac theory. We show, that although Rosenfeld
refrained from fully applying his general findings to this example, he could
have obtained the Hamiltonian. Many of Rosenfeld's discoveries were
re-developed or re-discovered by others two decades later, yet as we show there
remain additional firsts that are still not recognized in the community.

photon flow from the measured inclusive photon flow via the double ratio
$R_{\rm \gamma}$, which defines the excess of direct over decay photons. The
inclusive photon sample is affected by a modest contamination from different
background sources, which is often ignored in measurements. However, due to the
sensitivity of the direct photon measurement even a residual contamination may
significantly bias the extracted direct photon flow. In particular, for
measurements using photon conversions, which are very powerful at low
transverse momentum, these effects can be substantial. Assuming three different
types of correlated background contributions we demonstrate using the
Therminator2 event generator that the impact of the contamination on the
magnitude of direct photon flow can be on the level of $50\%$, even if the
purity of the inclusive photon sample is about $97\%$. Future measurements
should attempt to account for the contamination by measuring the background
contributions and subtracting them from the inclusive photon flow.

at large angular scales provides a smoking-gun evidence for the primordial
gravitational waves (GWs). It is often stated that a discovery of the GWs
establishes the quantum fluctuation of vacuum during the cosmic inflation.
Since the GWs could also be generated by source fields, however, we need to
check if a sizable signal exists due to such source fields before reaching a
firm conclusion when the B-mode is discovered. Source fields of particular
types can generate non-Gaussianity (NG) in the GWs. Testing statistics of the
B-mode is a powerful way of detecting such NG. As a concrete example, we show a
model in which a gauge field sources chiral GWs via a pseudoscalar coupling,
and forecast the detection significance at the future CMB satellite LiteBIRD.
Effects of residual foregrounds and lensing B-mode are both taken into account.
We find the B-mode bispectrum ""BBB"" is in particular sensitive to the
source-field NG, which is detectable at LiteBIRD with a $> 3 \sigma$
significance. Therefore the search for the ""BBB"" will be indispensable toward
unambiguously establishing quantum fluctuation of vacuum when the B-mode is
discovered. We also introduced the Minkowski functional to detect the NGs.
While we find that the Minkowski functional is less efficient than the
harmonic-space bispectrum estimator, it still serves as a useful cross check.
Finally, we also discuss the possibility of extracting clean information on
parity violation of GWs, and new types of parity-violating observables induced
by lensing.

  coefficient in ancient DNA","14 pages, 3 figures","Scientific Reports 6, 31561 (2016)",,,"q-bio.PE physics.bio-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Time-series of allele frequencies are a useful and unique set of data to
determine the strength of natural selection on the background of genetic drift.
Technically, the selection coefficient is estimated by means of a likelihood
function built under the hypothesis that the available trajectory spans a
sufficiently large portion of the fitness landscape. Especially for ancient
DNA, however, often only one single such trajectories is available and the
coverage of the fitness landscape is very limited. In fact, one single
trajectory is more representative of a process conditioned both in the initial
and in the final condition than of a process free to visit the available
fitness landscape. Based on two models of population genetics, here we show how
to build a likelihood function for the selection coefficient that takes the
statistical peculiarity of single trajectories into account. We show that this
conditional likelihood delivers a precise estimate of the selection coefficient
also when allele frequencies are close to fixation whereas the unconditioned
likelihood fails. Finally, we discuss the fact that the traditional,
unconditioned likelihood always delivers an answer, which is often
unfalsifiable and appears reasonable also when it is not correct.

estimation. Typically, redshift estimation has been treated as a regression
problem that takes as input magnitudes and maps them to a single target
redshift. In this work we acknowledge the fact that observed magnitudes may
actually admit multiple plausible redshifts, i.e. the distribution of redshifts
explaining the observed magnitudes (or colours) is multimodal. Hence, employing
one of the standard regression models, as is typically done, is insufficient
for this kind of problem, as most models implement either one-to-one or
many-to-one mappings. The observed multimodality of solutions is a direct
consequence of (a) the variety of physical mechanisms that give rise to the
observations, (b) the limited number of measurements available and (c) the
presence of noise in photometric measurements. Our proposed solution consists
in formulating a model from first principles capable of generating spectra. The
generated spectra are integrated over filter curves to produce magnitudes which
are then matched to the observed magnitudes. The resulting model naturally
expresses a multimodal posterior over possible redshifts, includes measurement
uncertainty (e.g. missing values) and is shown to perform favourably on a real
dataset.

Compression Expansion Machine (RCEM), is described and its use for studying
chemical kinetics is demonstrated. Like conventional RCMs, the RCEM quickly
compresses a fuel/air mixture by pushing a piston into a cylinder; the
resulting high temperatures and pressures initiate chemical reactions. In
addition, the machine can rapidly expand the compressed gas in a controlled way
by pulling the piston outwards again. This freezes chemical activity after a
pre-defined reaction duration, and therefore allows a convenient probe sampling
and ex-situ gas analysis of stable species. The RCEM therefore is a promising
instrument for studying chemical kinetics, including also partially reacted
fuel/air mixtures. The setup of the RCEM, its experimental characteristics and
its use for studying chemical reactions are outlined in detail. To allow
comparisons of RCEM results with predictions of chemical reaction mechanisms, a
simple numerical model of the RCEM process is described. As a first
application, ex-situ measurements of the temporal evolution of species in
partially reacted dimethyl ether/methane-mixtures are presented, and the
results are compared to predictions of a reaction mechanism.

the coalescences of two black hole pairs. These detections have strengthened
our belief that compact binary coalescences (CBCs) are the most promising GW
detection prospects accessible to ground-based interferometric detectors. For
detecting CBC signals it is of vital importance to characterize and identify
non-Gaussian and non-stationary noise in these detectors. In this work we model
two important classes of transient artifacts that contribute to this noise and
adversely affect the detector sensitivity to CBC signals. One of them is the
sine-Gaussian glitch, characterized by a central frequency $f_0$ and a quality
factor $Q$ and the other is the chirping sine-Gaussian glitch, which is
characterized by $f_0$, $Q$ as well as a chirp parameter. We study the response
a bank of compact binary inspiral templates has to these two families of
glitches when they are used to match-filter data containing any of these
glitches. Two important characteristics of this response are the distributions
of the signal-to-noise ratio and the timelag of individual templates. We show
how these distributions differ from those when the detector data has a real CBC
signal instead of a glitch. We argue that these distinctions can be utilized to
develop useful signal-artifact vetos that add negligibly to the computational
cost of a CBC search. Specifically, we show how $f_0$ of a glitch can be used
to set adaptive time-windows around it so that any template trigger occurring
in that window can be quarantined for further vetting of its supposed
astrophysical nature. Second, we recommend focusing efforts on reducing the
incidence of glitches with low $f_0$ values because they create CBC triggers
with the longest timelags. This work allows us to associate such triggers with
the glitches which otherwise would have escaped attention.

including the rotational velocity of particle is decoupled into two parts, i.e.
the local equilibrium distribution function of the translational velocity of

equilibrium functions, two lattice Boltzmann models are derived via the Hermite
expansion, namely one is in relation to the translational velocity and the
other is connected with the rotational velocity. Accordingly, the distribution

Boltzmann models used in the scheme proposed by this work are constructed via
the Hermite expansion, so it is easy to construct new schemes of higher-order
accuracy. To validate the proposed scheme, a shock tube simulation is
performed. The numerical results agree with the analytical solutions very well.

superconductivity (Tc ~13 K). Although the general electron-phonon coupling is
still the main mechanism for electron pairing in LTO, unconventional behaviors
such as the anomalous magnetoresistance, anisotropic orbital/spin
susceptibilities, etc. reveal that both the spin and the orbital interactions
should also be considered for understanding the superconductivity. Here, we
investigate tunneling spectra of [111]-, [110]- and [001]-oriented high quality
LTO thin films. Several bosonic modes in tunneling spectra are observed in the
[111]- and [110]-oriented films but not in [001]-oriented ones, and these modes
still exist at T = 2Tc and beyond the upper critical field, which are confirmed
as stemming from electron-phonon interaction by DFT calculations. These modes
only appear in special surface orientations, indicating that the
electron-phonon coupling in LTO system is highly anisotropic and may be
enhanced by orbital-related state. The anisotropic electron-phonon coupling
should be taken seriously in understanding the nature of LTO superconductivity.

Using a non-equilibrium Green's function formalism in the adiabatic limit, we
show that fluctuating metal-molecule couplings lead to new frictional damping

Numerical tests are performed and compared with a modified classical master

relate the degree of deviation of a particular currency from such an ""inverse

viz., measures of per capita production output and diversity of export

by the exchange rate dynamics for currencies belonging to developed economies,
those of the less developed economies show characteristics of sub-diffusive
processes which we relate to the anti-correlated nature of the corresponding
fluctuations. Approaches similar to that presented here may help in identifying
invariant features obscured by the heterogeneous nature of components in other

This multi-stage procedure can be easily implemented in existing parallel codes

dangerous. For such agents, it is desirable to determine confidence interval
lower bounds on the performance of any given policy without executing said
policy. Current methods for exact high confidence off-policy evaluation that
use importance sampling require a substantial amount of data to achieve a tight
lower bound. Existing model-based methods only address the problem in discrete
state spaces. Since exact bounds are intractable for many domains we trade off
strict guarantees of safety for more data-efficient approximate bounds. In this
context, we propose two bootstrapping off-policy evaluation methods which use
learned MDP transition models in order to estimate lower confidence bounds on
policy performance with limited data in both continuous and discrete state
spaces. Since direct use of a model may introduce bias, we derive a theoretical
upper bound on model bias for when the model transition function is estimated
with i.i.d. trajectories. This bound broadens our understanding of the
conditions under which model-based methods have high bias. Finally, we
empirically evaluate our proposed methods and analyze the settings in which
different bootstrapping off-policy confidence interval methods succeed and

various informations at the hospital such as health care facility, medical
records, and also human resource data. The fasten access could be achieved by
implementing face recognition and live streaming as part of the digital
assistant system. By using face recognition, DIANE can identify patient's
identity. Moreover, DIANE could know patient's biodata and also patient's
medical records. Live streaming in DIANE enables doctor to communicate with
other doctors in different place. Through the increasing speed of doctor to
access the various informations at the hospital, it is expected that doctor can
make decisions more quickly. As a result, more and more patients can be treated
by the doctor properly.

  DIANE merupakan sebuah sistem digital assistant yang bertujuan untuk
mempercepat akses staf medik fungsional sebagai seorang profesional dengan
waktu terbatas terhadap informasi seperti layanan kesehatan, rekam medis, dan
personalia pada SIRS tingkat rumah sakit. Percepatan akses terhadap informasi
tersebut diwujudkan melalui penggunaan fitur face recognition dan live
streaming. Dengan menggunakan face recognition, DIANE dapat mengidentifikasi
pasien sehingga dapat memberikan tampilan data berupa biodata dan rekam medis
pasien. Sedangkan menggunakan live streaming pada DIANE, seorang staf medik
fungsional dapat berkomunikasi dengan staf medik fungsional di tempat lain.
Dengan peningkatan kecepatan akses terhadap beragam informasi tersebut
diharapkan seorang staf medik fungsional dapat mengambil keputusan dengan lebih
cepat. Akibatnya, semakin banyak pasien yang dapat ditangani oleh staf medik
fungsional dengan baik.

using multi-wavelength observations of limb spicules in different chromospheric

about 6 Mm above the solar limb. The majority of features found at larger

with height above the limb. We find no indications that the spicules in our

financial securities. It combines two methods, Vibrato and automatic
differentiation and compares with other methods. We show that this combined
technique is faster than standard finite difference, more stable than automatic
differentiation of second order derivatives and more general than Malliavin
Calculus. We present a generic framework to compute any greeks and present
several applications on different types of financial contracts: European and
American options, multidimensional Basket Call and stochastic volatility models
such as Heston's model. We give also an algorithm to compute derivatives for
the Longstaff-Schwartz Monte Carlo method for American options. We also extend
automatic differentiation for second order derivatives of options with
non-twice differentiable payoff. 1. Introduction. Due to BASEL III regulations,
banks are requested to evaluate the sensitivities of their portfolios every day
(risk assessment). Some of these portfolios are huge and sensitivities are time
consuming to compute accurately. Faced with the problem of building a software
for this task and distrusting automatic differentiation for non-differentiable
functions, we turned to an idea developed by Mike Giles called Vibrato. Vibrato
at core is a differentiation of a combination of likelihood ratio method and
pathwise evaluation. In Giles [12], [13], it is shown that the computing time,
stability and precision are enhanced compared with numerical differentiation of
the full Monte Carlo path. In many cases, double sensitivities, i.e. second
derivatives with respect to parameters, are needed (e.g. gamma hedging). Finite
difference approximation of sensitivities is a very simple method but its
precision is hard to control because it relies on the appropriate choice of the
increment. Automatic differentiation of computer programs bypass the difficulty
and its computing cost is similar to finite difference, if not cheaper. But in
finance the payoff is never twice differentiable and so generalized derivatives
have to be used requiring approximations of Dirac functions of which the
precision is also doubtful. The purpose of this paper is to investigate the
feasibility of Vibrato for second and higher derivatives. We will first compare
Vibrato applied twice with the analytic differentiation of Vibrato and show
that it is equivalent, as the second is easier we propose the best compromise
for second derivatives: Automatic Differentiation of Vibrato. In [8], Capriotti
has recently investigated the coupling of different mathematical methods --
namely pathwise and likelihood ratio methods -- with an Automatic differ

most distinctive difference between random and quantum walks is the replacement
of the random coin in the former by the action of a unitary operator upon some
internal property of the later. We provide explicit expressions for the
solution to the problem when the most general form for the homogeneous unitary
operator is considered, and we analyze several key features of the system as
the presence of symmetries or stationary limits. After that, we analyze the
consequences of letting the properties of the coin operator change from site to
site, and from time step to time step. In spite of this lack of homogeneity,
the probabilistic properties of the motion of the walker can remain unaltered
if the coin variability is chosen adequately. Finally, we show how this
invariance can be connected to the gauge freedom of electromagnetism.

stochastically quantized to low bitwidth numbers before being propagated to

operate on low bitwidth weights and activations/gradients respectively,
DoReFa-Net can use bit convolution kernels to accelerate both training and
inference. Moreover, as bit convolutions can be efficiently implemented on CPU,
FPGA, ASIC and GPU, DoReFa-Net opens the way to accelerate training of low
bitwidth neural network on these hardware. Our experiments on SVHN and ImageNet
datasets prove that DoReFa-Net can achieve comparable prediction accuracy as

$D^L(s)$, have been employed in QCD applications like quark mass determinations
or hadronic $\tau$ decays. $D^L(s)$ suffers from large higher-order corrections
and, by resorting to the large-$\beta_0$ approximation, it is shown that this
is related to a spurious renormalon ambiguity at $u=1$. Hence, this correlator
should be avoided in phenomenological analyses. Moreover, it turns out
advantageous to express the quark mass factor, introduced to make the scalar
current renormalisation group invariant, in terms of the renormalisation
invariant quark mass $\hat m_q$. To further study the behaviour of the
perturbative expansion, we introduce a QCD coupling $\hat\alpha_s$, whose
running is explicitly renormalisation scheme independent. The scheme dependence
of $\hat\alpha_s$ is parametrised by a single parameter $C$, being related to
transformations of the QCD scale parameter $\Lambda$. It is demonstrated that
appropriate choices of $C$ lead to a substantial improvement in the behaviour

groups of carriers with different scattering rates. The analysis reveals that
the scattering rate of at least one of the Drude components develops linearly
with temperature for each doping level. This points towards strong
electron-electron correlations and a non-Fermi-liquid behavior in the
P-substituted superconducting Eu-122 pnictides. We also detect a transfer of
the spectral weight from mid-infrared to higher frequencies and assign it to
the Hund's-rule coupling between itinerant and localized carriers. The
conductivity spectra below the superconducting transition show no sharp
features to be associated with the dirty-limit superconducting BCS gaps. We
interpret these results in terms of clean-limit superconductivity in

substantial improvements in the perturbative prediction of physical

physical properties of the stellar source using stellar evolution and
atmosphere models and constrains the line of sight extinction using a newly

of multiple data flows that need to be completed over a shared set of
distributed resources. Such a computation completes when all of its flows
complete. A useful abstraction for modeling such scenarios is a {\em coflow},
which is a collection of flows (e.g., tasks, packets, data transmissions) that
all share the same performance goal.
  In this paper, we present the first approximation algorithms for scheduling
coflows over general network topologies with the objective of minimizing total
weighted completion time. We consider two different models for coflows based on
the nature of individual flows: circuits, and packets. We design
constant-factor polynomial-time approximation algorithms for scheduling
packet-based coflows with or without given flow paths, and circuit-based
coflows with given flow paths. Furthermore, we give an $O(\log n/\log \log
n)$-approximation polynomial time algorithm for scheduling circuit-based
coflows where flow paths are not given (here $n$ is the number of network
edges).
  We obtain our results by developing a general framework for coflow schedules,
based on interval-indexed linear programs, which may extend to other coflow
models and objective functions and may also yield improved approximation bounds
for specific network scenarios. We also present an experimental evaluation of
our approach for circuit-based coflows that show a performance improvement of
at least 22% on average over competing heuristics.

particle constrained to remain on a hypersurface is in fact a half-finished
version for it is established without regard to the fact that the particle can
never depart from the geodesics on the surface. Once the fact be taken into
consideration, the equation takes that same form as that for centripetal force
law, provided that the symbols are re-interpreted so that the law is applicable
for higher dimensions. The controversial issue of constructing operator forms
of these equations is addressed, and our studies show the quantization of
constrained system based on the extrinsic equation of motion is favorable.

significantly affected by the equalization enhanced phase noise (EEPN), due to
the interaction between the electronic dispersion compensation (EDC) and the
laser phase noise. In this paper, we present a comprehensive study on different
chromatic dispersion (CD) compensation and carrier phase recovery (CPR)
approaches, in the n-level phase shift keying (n-PSK) and the n-level
quadrature amplitude modulation (n-QAM) coherent optical transmission systems,
considering the impacts of EEPN. Four CD compensation methods are considered:
the time-domain equalization (TDE), the frequency-domain equalization (FDE),
the least mean square (LMS) adaptive equalization are applied for EDC, and the
dispersion compensating fiber (DCF) is employed for optical dispersion
compensation (ODC). Meanwhile, three carrier phase recovery methods are also
involved: a one-tap normalized least mean square (NLMS) algorithm, a block-wise
average (BWA) algorithm, and a Viterbi-Viterbi (VV) algorithm. Numerical
simulations have been carried out in a 28-Gbaud dual-polarization quadrature
phase shift keying (DP-QPSK) coherent transmission system, and the results
indicate that the origin of EEPN depends on the choice of chromatic dispersion
compensation methods, and the effects of EEPN also behave moderately different
in accordance to different carrier phase recovery scenarios.

  prediction",,,,,"q-bio.BM","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Predicting the 3D structure of a macromolecule, such as a protein or an RNA
molecule, is ranked top among the most difficult and attractive problems in
bioinformatics and computational biology. Its importance comes from the
relationship between the 3D structure and the function of a given protein or
RNA. 3D structures also help to find the ligands of the protein, which are
usually small molecules, a key step in drug design. Unfortunately, there is no
shortcut to accurately obtain the 3D structure of a macromolecule. Many
physical measurements of macromolecular 3D structures cannot scale up, due to
their large labor costs and the requirements for lab conditions.
  In recent years, computational methods have made huge progress due to advance
in computation speed and machine learning methods. These methods only need the
sequence information to predict 3D structures by employing various mathematical
models and machine learning methods. The success of computational methods is
highly dependent on a large database of the proteins and RNA with known
structures.
  However, the performance of computational methods are always expected to be
improved. There are several reasons for this. First, we are facing, and will
continue to face sparseness of data.Secondly, the 3D structure space is too
large for our computational capability.
  The two obstacles can be removed by knowledge-based methods, which combine
knowledge learned from the known structures and biologists' knowledge of the
folding process of protein or RNA. In the dissertation, I will present my
results in building a knowledge-based method by using machine learning methods
to tackle this problem. My methods include the knowledge constraints on
intermediate states, which can highly reduce the solution space of a protein or
RNA, in turn increasing the efficiency of the structure folding method and
improving its accuracy.
