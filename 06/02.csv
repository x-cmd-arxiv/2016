effects in the I-V characteristics of perovskite based solar cells. By making a
simple ansatz for the polarization relaxation, our model is able to reproduce
qualitatively and quantitatively detailed features of measured I-V
characteristics. Pre-poling effects are discussed, pointing out the differences
between initially over- and under-polarized samples. In particular, the
presence of the current over-shoot observed in the reverse characteristics is
correlated with the solar cell pre-conditioning. Furthermore, the dynamic
hysteresis is analyzed with respect to changing the bias scan rate, the
obtained results being consistent with experimentally reported data: the
hysteresis amplitude is maximum at intermediate scan rates, while at very slow
and very fast ones it becomes negligible. The effects induced by different
relaxation time scales are assessed. The proposed dynamic electrical model
offers a comprehensive view of the solar cell operation, being a practical tool
for future calibration of tentative microscopic descriptions.

March 2012 shows an evolution of two consecutive EUV waves that interact with
the footpoint of a coronal streamer evident in the co-spatial and co-temporal
STEREO-B/COR-I observations. The evolution of EUV waves is clearly evident in
STEREO-B/EUVI, and its energy exchange with coronal streamer generates kink
oscillations. We estimate the phase velocities of the kink wave perturbations
by tracking it at different heights of the coronal streamer. We also estimate
the electron densities inside and outside the streamer using SSI of polarized
brightness images in STEREO-B/COR-1 observations. Taking into account the MHD
theory of kink waves in a cylindrical waveguide, their observed properties at
various heights, and density contrast of the streamer, we estimate the radial
profile of magnetic field within this magnetic structure. Both the kink waves
diagnose the exponentially decaying radial profiles of the magnetic field in
coronal steamer upto 3 solar radii. Within the limit of uncertainties in the
measurements, it is indicated that coronal magnetic field of the streamer
varies slowly in time at various heights, although its nature always remains
exponentially decaying. It is seen that during the evolution of second kink
motion in the streamer, it increases in brightness, and also in areal extent
slightly, which may be associated with the decreased photospheric magnetic flux
at its footpoint. As a result, the magnetic field profile produced by the
second kink wave is reduced within the streamer compared to the one diagnosed
by the first one. The precisely estimated magnetic field profiles with the
uncertainty less than 10% match well with the empirical profile and various
observational estimations of the outer coronal magnetic field.

properties of semiconducting or insulating materials. Therefore we study the
impact of point and line defects on the electronic structure and optical
properties of MoS2 monolayers using density-functional methods. The different
types of defects form electronic states that are spatially localized on the
defect. The strongly localized nature is reflected in weak electronic
interactions between individual point or line defect and a weak dependence of
the defect formation energy on the defect concentration or line defect
separation. In the electronic energy spectrum the defect states occur as deep
levels in the band gap, as shallow levels very close to the band edges, as well
as levels in-between the bulk states. Due to their strongly localized nature,
all states of point defects are sharply peaked in energy. Periodic line defects
form nearly dispersionless one-dimensional band structures and the related
spectral features are also strongly peaked. The electronic structure of the
monolayer system is quite robust and it is well preserved for point defect
concentrations of up to 6%. The impact of point defects on the optical
absorption for concentrations of 1% and below is found to be very small. For
higher defect concentrations molybdenum vacancies were found to quench the
overall absorption and sulfur defects lead to sharp absorption peaks below the
absorption edge of the ideal monolayer. For line defects, we did not find a
considerable impact on the absorption spectrum. These results support recent
experiments on defective transition metal chalcogenides.

optimally placing data centers that are dispatchable (with flexible loads)
provides system-wide flexibility, reduces stranded power, and improves

similar to the DC PNe. In agreement with recent literature, the DC PNe mostly
descend from high-mass (M > 3.5 Msun) solar/supersolar metallicity AGBs that
experience hot bottom burning (HBB), but other formation channels in low-mass
AGBs like extra mixing, stellar rotation, binary interaction, or He
pre-enrichment cannot be disregarded until more accurate C/O ratios would be
obtained. Two objects among the DC PNe show the imprint of advanced CNO
processing and deep second dredge-up, suggesting progenitors masses close to
the limit to evolve as core collapse supernovae (above 6 Msun). Their actual
C/O ratio, if confirmed, indicate contamination from the third dredge-up,
rejecting the hypothesis that the chemical composition of such high-metallicity
massive AGBs is modified exclusively by HBB.

Monthly client IPv4 address counts showed constant growth for years prior, but
since 2014, the IPv4 count has stagnated while IPv6 counts have grown. Thus, it

established that injecting driving and trailing electron bunches into a

that injecting the electron bunches into a negative density gradient of
ten-fold decreasing density over 10 cm long plasma, results in spatially more

emotionally intelligent with the ability to decode human affective states would
allow a more meaningful and natural way of human-computer interactions (HCIs).
One unobtrusive and non-invasive way of recognizing human affective states
entails the exploration of how physiological signals vary under different
emotional experiences. In particular, this paper explores the correlation
between autonomically-mediated changes in multimodal body signals and discrete
emotional states. In order to fully exploit the information in each modality,
we have provided an innovative classification approach for three specific
physiological signals including Electromyogram (EMG), Blood Volume Pressure
(BVP) and Galvanic Skin Response (GSR). These signals are analyzed as inputs to
an emotion recognition paradigm based on fusion of a series of weak learners.
Our proposed classification approach showed 88.1% recognition accuracy, which
outperformed the conventional Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier with 17%
accuracy improvement. Furthermore, in order to avoid information redundancy and
the resultant over-fitting, a feature reduction method is proposed based on a
correlation analysis to optimize the number of features required for training
and validating each weak learner. Results showed that despite the feature space
dimensionality reduction from 27 to 18 features, our methodology preserved the
recognition accuracy of about 85.0%. This reduction in complexity will get us
one step closer towards embedding this human emotion encoder in the wireless

($0\nu\beta \beta$) half-life and lepton flavour violation (LFV) amplitude
within the framework of the minimal left-right symmetric model (MLRSM).
Considering all possible new physics contributions to $0\nu\beta \beta$ and
charged lepton flavour violation $\mu \rightarrow e \gamma, \mu \rightarrow 3e$
in MLRSM, we constrain the parameter space of the model from the requirement of
satisfying existing experimental bounds. Assuming the breaking scale of the
left-right symmetry to be $\mathcal{O}(1)$ TeV accessible at ongoing and near
future collider experiments, we consider the most general type I+II seesaw
mechanism for the origin of tiny neutrino masses. Choosing the relative
contribution of the type II seesaw term allows us to calculate the right handed
neutrino mass matrix as well as Dirac neutrino mass matrix as a function of the
model parameters, required for the calculation of $0\nu\beta \beta$ and LFV
amplitudes. We show that such a general type I+II seesaw structure results in
more allowed parameter space compared to individual type I or type II seesaw
cases considered in earlier works. In particular, we show that the doubly
charged scalar masses $M_{\Delta}$ are allowed to be smaller than the heaviest
right handed neutrino mass $M_N$ from the present experimental bounds in these
scenarios which is in contrast to earlier results with individual type I or
type II seesaw showing $M_{\Delta} > M_N$.

including starspots and chromospheric activity. The manner by which bundles of
magnetic field traverse portions of the convection zone to emerge at the
stellar surface is not especially well understood. In the Solar context, some
insight into this process has been gleaned by regarding the magnetism as
consisting partly of idealized thin flux tubes (TFT). Here, we present the
results of a large set of TFT simulations in a rotating spherical domain of
convective flows representative of a 0.3 solar-mass, main-sequence star. This
is the first study to investigate how individual flux tubes in such a star
might rise under the combined influence of buoyancy, convection, and
differential rotation. A time-dependent hydrodynamic convective flow field,
taken from separate 3D simulations calculated with the anelastic equations,
impacts the flux tube as it rises. Convective motions modulate the shape of the
initially buoyant flux ring, promoting localized rising loops. Flux tubes in
fully convective stars have a tendency to rise nearly parallel to the rotation
axis. However, the presence of strong differential rotation allows some
initially low latitude flux tubes of moderate strength to develop rising loops

popular for sampling hidden and/or marginalized populations. As such, even

the underlying social network: if the network is divided into communities that

these communities. In order to diminish the ""referral bottlenecks"" between
communities, we propose anti-cluster RDS (AC-RDS), an adjustment to the
standard RDS implementation. Using a standard model in the RDS literature,
namely, a Markov process on the social network that is indexed by a tree, we
construct and study the Markov transition matrix for AC-RDS. We show that if
the underlying network is generated from the Stochastic Blockmodel with equal
block sizes, then the transition matrix for AC-RDS has a larger spectral gap
and consequently faster mixing properties than the standard random walk model
for RDS. In addition, we show that AC-RDS reduces the covariance of the samples
in the referral tree compared to the standard RDS and consequently leads to a
smaller variance and design effect. We confirm the effectiveness of the new
design using both the Add-Health networks and simulated networks.

that two phases with antiferromagnetic long-range are separated by a narrow
region of a spin-liquid like quantum phase around $p=0.55$. Thus the strong

open a window for an unconventional quantum ground state in this

""recovering information"" from time signals, concluding that CS and RS
outperform FDM. We argue that this comparison is invalid for the following
reasons. FDM is a well established method designed for solving the harmonic
inversion problem or, similarly, for the problem of spectral estimation, and as
such should be applied only to problems of this kind. The authors incorrectly
assume that the problem of data fitting is equivalent to the spectral
estimation problem, regardless of what parametric form is used, and,
consequently, in all five numerical examples FDM is applied to the wrong
problem. Moreover, the authors' implementation of FDM turned out to be
incorrect, leading to extremely bad results, caused by numerical instabilities.
As we demonstrate here, if implemented correctly, FDM could still be used for
fitting the data, at least for the time signals composed of damped sinusoids,
resulting in superior performance. In addition, we show that the published

using a descriptor-based screening through the calculation of a few properties

principles density functional theory calculated property values is important
for the success of descriptor-based screening. Bayesian error estimation
approach has been built-in to several recently developed exchange-correlation
functionals, which allows an estimate of the uncertainty associated with
properties related to the ground state energy, for e.g. adsorption energies.
Here, we propose a robust and computationally efficient method for quantifying
uncertainty in mechanical properties, which depends on the derivatives of the
energy. The procedure involves calculating the energy around the equilibrium
cell volume with different strains and fitting the obtained energies to the
corresponding energy-strain relationship. At each strain, we use instead of a
single energy, an ensemble of energies, giving us an ensemble of fits and
thereby, an ensemble of mechanical properties associated with each fit, whose
spread can be used to quantify its uncertainty. The generation of ensemble of
energies is only a post-processing step involving a perturbation of parameters
of the exchange-correlation functional and solving for the energy non-self
consistently. The proposed method is computationally efficient and provides a
more robust uncertainty estimate compared to the approach of self-consistent
calculations employing several different exchange-correlation functionals. We
demonstrate the method by calculating the uncertainty bounds for Si using the
developed method. We show that the calculated uncertainty bounds the property
values obtained using three different GGA functionals: PBE, PBEsol and RPBE.

beyond the state of art calls for forward-thinking visionary solutions, not
just more of the same. I present the argument that general game playing
artificial intelligence will require a generalised player model. This is
because games are inherently human artefacts which therefore, as a class of
problems, contain cases which require a human-style problem solving approach. I

spectral lines, i.e. modulation on the rotational timescale, but not strictly
periodic. The variability occurs in the so-called discrete absorption
components (DACs) that accelerate through the UV-wind line profiles and also in
many optical lines. For such OB stars no dipolar magnetic fields have been
detected with upper limits of ~300G. We investigate whether multiple magnetic
loops on the surface rather than non-radial pulsations or a dipolar magnetic
field can explain the observed cyclical UV and optical spectral line
variability. We present time-resolved, high-resolution optical spectroscopy of
the O6.5I(n)fp star lambda Cep. We apply a simplified phenomenological model in
which multiple spherical blobs attached to the surface represent magnetic-loop
structures, which we call stellar prominences, by analogy with solar
prominences. We compare the calculated line profiles as a function of
rotational phase, adopting a rotation period of 4.1d, with observed relative
changes in subsequent quotient spectra. We identify many periodicities in
spectral lines, almost none of which is stable over timescales from months to
years. We show that the relative changes in various optical absorption and
emission lines are often very similar. Our proposed model applied to the HeII
4686 line can typically be fitted with 2-5 equatorial blobs with lifetimes
between ~1 and 24h. Given the irregular timescales involved, we propose that
the azimuthal distribution of DACs correspond to the locations of stellar
prominences attached to the surface. This could explain the observed
variability of optical and UV lines, and put constraints on the strength and
lifetime of these structures, which can be compared with recent theoretical
predictions, in which bright magnetic surface spots are formed by the action of
the subsurface convection zone.

generator coordinate method (GCM) and the recovery of symmetries used in
nuclear physics with effective forces. After a reminder of the
Hartree-Fock-Bogoliubov (HFB) theory a discussion of the shortcomings of any
mean field approximation (MFA) is presented. The recovery of the symmetries
spontaneously broken in the HFB approach, in particular the angular momentum,
is necessary, among others, to describe excited states and transitions.
Particle number projection is needed to guarantee the right number of protons
and neutrons. Furthermore a projection before the variation prevents the
pairing collapse in the weak pairing regime. The lack of fluctuations around
the average values of the MFA is a shortcoming of this approach. To build in
correlations in BMFT one selects the relevant degrees of freedom: quadrupole,
octupole and the pairing vibrations as well as the single particle ones. In the
GCM the operators representing these degrees of freedom are used as coordinates
to generate a collective subspace. The highly correlated GCM wave function is
finally written as a linear combination of a projected basis of this space. The
variation of the coefficients of the linear combination leads to the
Hill-Wheeler equation. We discuss the classical beta and gamma vibrations by
considering the quadrupole operators as coordinates. We present pairing
fluctuations by considering the pairing gaps as generator coordinates. Lastly
the explicit consideration of the time reversal symmetry breaking in the HFB
wave function by the cranking procedure allows the alignment of nucleon pairs
opening a new dimension in the BMFT calculations. Abundant calculations with
the Gogny force illustrate the state-of-the-art of BMFTs with density
functionals. We conclude with a thorough discussion on the potential poles of
the theory.

present a novel fiber-to-waveguide coupler, named ""L-coupler"", through which
the light fed from the top of a chip can bend 90{\deg} with low reflection and
is then efficiently coupled into an on-chip Si waveguide within a short
propagation distance (<20{\mu}m). The key element is a bent metal-clad
waveguide with a big matched input port. According to our finite-difference
time-domain (FDTD) simulation, the coupling efficiency is over 80% within a
broad range of working wavelengths in the near-infrared regime for a transverse
electric input Gaussian wave. The coupler is polarization-dependent, with very
low coupling efficiency (6%-9%) for transverse magnetic waves. The coupler can
also be used for three-dimensional (3D) chip-to-chip optical interconnection by
efficiently coupling light into an integrated photonic chip from a
vertical-cavity surface-emitting laser (VCSEL), or Si waveguide on another
chip. The work presented in this Arxiv article has been filed as a patent.

large enhancements in $T_c$ continue due to the presence of `robust' peaks in

based on multi-band photometry and high-resolution spectroscopy. Two new
transit events of WASP-98b were simultaneously observed in four passbands
(g,r,i,z), using the telescope-defocussing technique, yielding eight
high-precision light curves with point-to-point scatters of less than 1 mmag.
We also collected three spectra of the parent star with a high-resolution
spectrograph, which we used to remeasure its spectral characteristics, in
particular its metallicity. We found this to be very low, Fe/H]=-0.49, but
larger than was previously reported, [Fe/H]=-0.60. We used these new
photometric and spectroscopic data to refine the orbital and physical
properties of this planetary system, finding that the stellar and planetary
mass measurements are significantly larger than those in the discovery paper.
In addition, the multi-band light curves were used to construct an optical
transmission spectrum of WASP-98b and probe the characteristics of its
atmosphere at the terminator. We measured a lower radius at z compared with the
other three passbands. The maximum variation is between the r and z bands, has
a confidence level of roughly 6 sigma and equates to 5.5 pressure scale
heights. We compared this spectrum to theoretical models, investigating several
possible types of atmospheres, including hazy, cloudy, cloud-free, and clear
atmospheres with titanium and vanadium oxide opacities. We could not find a
good fit to the observations, except in the extreme case of a clear atmosphere
with TiO and VO opacities, in which the condensation of Ti and V was
suppressed. As this case is unrealistic, our results suggest the presence of an
additional optical-absorbing species in the atmosphere of WASP-98b, of unknown
chemical nature.

possible annihilation and decay signals they are often treated as approximately
spherical. In this work, we examine the asymmetry of potential indirect
detection signals of DM annihilation and decay, exploiting the large statistics
of the hydrodynamic simulation Illustris. We carefully investigate the effects
of the baryons on the sphericity of annihilation and decay signals for both the
case where the observer is at 8.5 kpc from the center of the halo (exemplified
in the case of Milky Way-like halos), and for an observer situated well outside
the halo. In the case of Galactic signals, we find that both annihilation and
decay signals are expected to be quite symmetric, with axis ratios very
different from 1 occurring rarely. In the case of extragalactic signals, while
decay signals are still preferentially spherical, the axis ratio for
annihilation signals has a much flatter distribution, with elongated profiles
appearing frequently. Many of these elongated profiles are due to large
subhalos and/or recent mergers. Comparing to gamma-ray emission from the Milky
Way and X-ray maps of clusters, we find that the gamma-ray background appears
less spherical/more elongated than the expected DM signal from the large
majority of halos, and the Galactic gamma ray excess appears very spherical,
while the X- ray data would be difficult to distinguish from a DM signal by
elongation/sphericity measurements alone.

have very deep spectroscopic observations (>7 hrs) at lambda=850-1300 A, with
the Low Resolution Imaging Spectrograph on the Keck Telescope. By using an
iterative approach in which we calculate the ratios of composite spectra in
different bins of continuum color excess, E(B-V), we derive a dust curve that
implies a lower attenuation in the far-UV for a given E(B-V) than those
obtained with standard attenuation curves. We demonstrate that the UV composite
spectra of z~3 galaxies can be modeled well by assuming our new attenuation
curve, a high covering fraction of HI, and absorption from the Lyman-Werner
bands of H2 with a small (<20%) covering fraction. The low covering fraction of
H2 relative to that of the HI and dust suggests that most of the dust in the
ISM of typical galaxies at z~3 is unrelated to the catalysis of H2, and is
associated with other phases of the ISM (i.e., the ionized and neutral gas).
The far-UV dust curve implies a factor of ~2 lower dust attenuation of Lyman
continuum (ionizing) photons relative to those inferred from the most commonly
assumed attenuation curves for L* galaxies at z~3. Our results may be utilized
to assess the degree to which ionizing photons are attenuated in HII regions

as a result of their common QCD origin when both types of matter (DM and

$\Lambda_{\rm QCD}$. Instead of conventional ""baryogenesis"" mechanism we
advocate a paradigm when the ""baryogenesis"" is actually a charge separation
process which always occur in the presence of the $\cal{CP}$ odd axion field
$a(x)$. In this scenario the global baryon number of the Universe remains zero,
while the unobserved anti-baryon charge is hidden in form of heavy nuggets,
similar to Witten's strangelets and compromise the DM of the Universe. We argue
that the nuggets will be inevitably produced during the QCD phase transition as
a result of Kibble-Zurek mechanism on formation of the topological defects
during a phase transition. Relevant topological defects in our scenario are the
closed bubbles made of the $N_{\rm DW}=1$ axion domain walls. These bubbles, in
general, accrete the baryon (or anti baryon) charge, which eventually result in
formation of the nuggets and anti-nuggets carrying a huge baryon (anti-baryon)
charge. The main consequence of the model, $\Omega_{\rm dark} \approx
\Omega_{\rm visible}$ is insensitive to the axion mass which may assume any

potentially provide a mechanism for violating topological censorship. However,
these toroidal event horizons satisfy topological censorship by construction,

process normally need extreme input parameters (e.g., very low magnetic field
intensity and extraordinarily large Doppler factor) to explain its
multi-wavelength spectral energy distributions (SEDs). To avoid the extreme
model parameters, different models have been proposed (e.g., two-zone SSC model

leptonic model after including a weak external Compton component to re-explore
the simultaneous multi-wavelength SEDs of PKS 1424+240 in both high (2009) and

external photon field from either broad line region (BLR) or the dust torus.
However, the required energy density of seed photons from BLR or torus is about
3 orders of magnitude less than that constrained in luminous quasars (e.g.,
flat-spectrum radio quasars, FSRQs). This result suggests that the BLR/torus in
BL Lacs is much weaker than that of luminous FSRQs (but not fully disappear),

to disc ratios, morphological parameters of bulges and discs, vertical scale
heights of discs and their radial gradients defining the flare for different
morphological types and stellar mass bins, based on observations. The surface
brightness profiles for the face-on and edge-on views of each model were
simulated to find out whether the flared disc produces a Type-II break in the
disc profile when observed edge-on, and if so under what conditions. Contrary
to previous claims, we find that discs with realistic flares can produce
significant breaks in discs when observed edge-on. Specifically a flare with
the parameters of that of the Milky Way would produce a significant break of
the disc at a Rbreak of ~8.6 kpc if observed edge-on. Central bulges have no
significant effects on the results. These simulations show that flared discs
can explain the existence of many Type-II breaks observed in edge-on galaxies,
in a range of galaxies with low-to-intermediate break strength values of

work we show that if we take a large string $SNIa+BAO+H(z)+LSS+CMB$ of modern
cosmological observations, in which not only the CMB but also a rich sample of

be enhanced up to near $3.8\sigma$ in the context of the running vacuum model

Recently the RVM has been shown to provide an efficient and economical solution
to the $\sigma_8$-tension, which is one of the intriguing phenomenological
problems that has not been possible to solve within the $\Lambda$CDM so far.
This fact contributes to strengthen the possibility that dynamical vacuum

of the covariance matrix in high-dimensional settings. To curb the curse of
dimensionality, numerous methods assume that the population covariance (or
inverse covariance) matrix is sparse, while making no particular structural
assumptions on the desired pattern of sparsity. A highly-related, yet
complementary, literature studies the specific setting in which the measured
variables have a known ordering, in which case a banded population matrix is
often assumed. While the banded approach is conceptually and computationally
easier than asking for ""patternless sparsity,"" it is only applicable in very
specific situations (such as when data are measured over time or
one-dimensional space). This work proposes a generalization of the notion of
bandedness that greatly expands the range of problems in which banded
estimators apply.
  We develop convex regularizers occupying the broad middle ground between the
former approach of ""patternless sparsity"" and the latter reliance on having a
known ordering. Our framework defines bandedness with respect to a known graph
on the measured variables. Such a graph is available in diverse situations, and
we provide a theoretical, computational, and applied treatment of two new
estimators. An R package, called ggb, implements these new methods.

magnetic dipole radiation power that the magnetar supplies comes at the expense
of the star's rotational energy. However, radiation by gravitational waves
(GWs) can be more efficient than magnetic dipole radiation because of its
stronger dependence on neutron star spin rate Omega, i.e. Omega^6 (for a static
'mountain') or Omega^8 (for a r-mode fluid oscillation) versus Omega^4 for
magnetic dipole radiation. Here, we use the magnetic field B and initial spin
period P_0 inferred from SN and GRB observations to obtain simple constraints
on the dimensionless amplitude of the mountain of epsilon < 0.01 and r-mode
oscillation of alpha < 1, the former being similar to that obtained by recent
works. We then include GW emission within the magnetar model. We show that when
epsilon > 10^-4 (B/10^14 G) (P_0/1 ms) or alpha > 0.01 (B/10^14 G) (P_0/1

luminosity and increase in time to peak luminosity. Thus the GW effects studied
here are more pronounced for low B and short P_0 but are unlikely to be
important in modelling SN and GRB light curves since the amplitudes needed for
noticeable changes are quite large.

linear gravity-capillary waves in deep water, is investigated through
experiments and numerical simulations. This unsteady response state, which
consists of a V-shaped pattern behind the source and features periodic shedding
of pairs of depressions from the tips of the V, was first observed
qualitatively by Diorio et al. (Phys. Rev. Let., 103, 214502, 2009) and called
state III. In the present investigation, cinematic shadowgraph and
refraction-based techniques are utilized to measure the temporal evolution of
the free surface deformation pattern downstream of the source as it moves along
a towing tank, while numerical simulations of the model equation described by
Cho et al. (J. Fluid Mech., 672, 288-306, 2011) are used to extend the
experimental results over longer times than are possible in the experiments.
From the experiments, it is found that the speed-amplitude characteristics and
the shape of the depressions are nearly the same as those of the freely
propagating gravity-capillary lumps of inviscid potential theory. The decay
rate of the depressions is measured from their height-time characteristics,
which are well fitted by an exponential decay law with an order 1 decay
constant. It is found that the shedding period of the depression pairs
decreases with increasing source strength and speed. As the source speed
approaches $c_\mathrm{min}$, this period tends to about 1~s for all source
magnitudes. At the low-speed boundary of state III, a new response with
unsteady asymmetric shedding of depressions is found. This response is also
predicted by the model equation.

differences between gravitational wave (GW) and electromagnetic (EM) signals
caused by the wave effects in gravitational lensing. The GW signals can arrive
$earlier$ than the EM signals in some cases if the GW/EM signals have passed
through a lens, even if both signals were emitted simultaneously by a source.
GW wavelengths are much larger than EM wavelengths; therefore, the propagation
of the GWs does not follow the laws of geometrical optics, including the
Shapiro time delay, if the lens mass is less than approximately $10^5 {\rm
M}_\odot (f/{\rm Hz})^{-1}$, where $f$ is the GW frequency. The arrival time
difference can reach $\sim 0.1 \, {\rm s} \, (f/{\rm Hz})^{-1}$ if the signals
have passed by a lens of mass $\sim 8000{\rm M}_\odot (f/{\rm Hz})^{-1}$ with
the impact parameter smaller than the Einstein radius; therefore, it is more
prominent for lower GW frequencies. For example, when a distant super massive
black hole binary (SMBHB) in a galactic center is lensed by an intervening
galaxy, the time lag becomes of the order of $10$ days. Future pulsar timing
arrays including SKA (the Square Kilometre Array) and X-ray detectors may
detect several time lags by measuring the orbital phase differences between the
GW/EM signals in the SMBHBs. Gravitational lensing imprints a characteristic
modulation on a chirp waveform; therefore, we can deduce whether a measured
arrival time lag arises from intrinsic source properties or gravitational
lensing. Determination of arrival time differences would be extremely useful in
multimessenger observations and tests of general relativity.

significant amplification of the gauge fields to which it is coupled. The
amplified gauge fields can source characteristic scalar and tensor primordial
perturbations. Several phenomenological implications have been discussed in the
cases in which (i) $X$ is the inflation, and (ii) $X$ is a field different from
the inflation, that experiences a temporary speed up during inflation. In this
second case, visible sourced gravitational waves (GW) can be produced at the
CMB scales without affecting the scalar perturbations, even if the scale of
inflation is several orders of magnitude below what is required to produce a
visible vacuum GW signal. Perturbativity considerations can be used to limit
the regime in which these results are under perturbative control. We revised
limits recently claimed for the case (i), and we extend these considerations to
the case (ii). We show that, in both cases, these limits are satisfied by the
applications that generate signals at CMB scales. Applications that generate
gravitational waves and primordial black holes at much smaller scales are at
the limit of the validity of this perturbativity analysis, so we expect those
results to be valid up to possibly order one corrections.

technology that provides better endurance, write energy and performance than
traditional NVM technologies such as Flash. In embedded application such as
microcontroller SoC of Internet of Things (IoT), embedded Flash (eFlash) is
widely employed. However, eFlash is also associated with cost. Therefore,
replacing eFlash with STTRAM is desirable in IoTs for power-efficiency.
Although promising, STTRAM brings several new security and privacy challenges
that pose a significant threat to sensitive data in memory. This is inevitable
due to the underlying dependency of this memory technology on environmental
parameters such as temperature and magnetic fields that can be exploited by an
adversary to tamper with the program and data. In this paper, we investigate
these attacks and propose a novel memory architecture for attack resilient IoT
network. The information redundancy present in a homogeneous peer-to-peer
connected IoT network is exploited to restore the corrupted memory of any IoT
node when under attack. We are able to build a failsafe IoT system with STTRAM
based program memory which allows guaranteed execution of all the IoT nodes
without complete shutdown of any node under attack. Experimental results using

missing momenta and removal energies based on the multi-nucleon short-range
correlation~(SRC) model. The approach is based on the effective Feynman
diagrammatic method which allows to account for the relativistic effects
important in the SRC domain. In addition to two-nucleon SRC with center of mass
motion we derive also the contribution of three-nucleon SRCs to the nuclear
spectral functions. The latter is modeled based on the assumption that 3N SRCs
are a product of two sequential short range NN interactions. This approach
allowed us to express the 3N SRC part of the nuclear spectral function as a
convolution of two NN SRCs. Thus the knowledge of 2N SRCs allows us to model
both two- and three-nucleon SRC contributions to the spectral function. The
derivations of the spectral functions are based on the two theoretical
frameworks in evaluating covariant Feynman diagrams: In the first, referred as
virtual nucleon approximation, we reduce Feynman diagrams to the time ordered
noncovariant diagrams by evaluating nucleon spectators in the SRC at their
positive energy poles, neglecting explicitly the contribution from vacuum
diagrams. In the second approach, referred as light-front approximation, we
formulate the boost invariant nuclear spectral function in the light-front
reference frame in which case the vacuum diagrams are generally suppressed and
the bound nucleon is described by its light-cone variables such as momentum
fraction, transverse momentum and invariant mass.

function (LF) and its evolution during the peak epoch of cosmic star formation
at 1<z<3. We use our deep near ultraviolet imaging from WFC3/UVIS on the Hubble
Space Telescope (HST) and existing ACS/WFC and WFC3/IR imaging of three lensing
galaxy clusters, Abell 2744 and MACSJ0717 from the Hubble Frontier Field survey
and Abell 1689. We use photometric redshifts to identify 780 ultra-faint
galaxies with $M_{UV}$<-12.5 AB mag at 1<z<3. From these samples, we identified
5 new, faint, multiply imaged systems in A1689. We compute the rest-frame UV LF
and find the best-fit faint-end slopes of $\alpha=-1.56\pm0.04$,
$\alpha=-1.72\pm0.04$ and $\alpha=-1.94\pm0.06$ at 1.0<z<1.6, 1.6<z<2.2 and
2.2<z<3.0, respectively. Our results demonstrate that the UV LF becomes steeper
from z\sim1.3 to z\sim2.6 with no sign of a turnover down to $M_{UV}=-14$ AB
mag. We further derive the UV LFs using the Lyman break ""dropout"" selection and
confirm the robustness of our conclusions against different selection
methodologies. Because the sample sizes are so large, and extend to such faint
luminosities, the statistical uncertainties are quite small, and systematic
uncertainties (due to the assumed size distribution, for example), likely
dominate. If we restrict our analysis to galaxies and volumes above > 50%
completeness in order to minimize these systematics, we still find that the
faint-end slope is steep and getting steeper with redshift, though with
slightly shallower (less negative) values ($\alpha=-1.55\pm0.06$,
$-1.69\pm0.07$ and $-1.79\pm0.08$ for $z\sim1.3$, 1.9 and 2.6, respectively).
Finally, we conclude that the faint star-forming galaxies with UV magnitudes of
$-18.5<M_{UV}<-12.5$ covered in this study, produce the majority (55%-60%) of
the unobscured UV luminosity density at 1<z<3.

  mapping","9 pages, 5 figures",,,,"stat.AP q-bio.QM stat.ME","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Voxel-based lesion-symptom mapping (VLSM) is a major method for studying
brain-behavior relationships that leverages modern neuroimaging analysis
techniques to build on the classic approach of examining the relationship
between location of brain damage and cognitive deficits. Testing an association
between deficit severity and lesion status in each voxel involves very many
individual tests and requires statistical correction for multiple comparisons.
Several strategies have been adapted from analysis of functional neuroimaging
data, though VLSM faces a more difficult trade-off between avoiding false
positives and statistical power (missing true effects). One such strategy is
using permutation to non-parametrically determine a null distribution of
cluster sizes, which is then used to establish a minimum cluster size
threshold. This strategy is intuitively appealing because it respects the
necessary spatial contiguity of stroke lesions and connects with the typical
cluster-based interpretation of VLSM results. We evaluated this strategy for
detecting true lesion-symptom relations using simulated deficit scores based on
percent damage to defined brain regions (BA 45 and BA 39) in a sample of 124
individuals with left hemisphere stroke. Even under the most conservative
settings tested here, the region identified by VLSM with cluster size
correction systematically extended well beyond the true region. As a result,
this strategy appears to be effective for ruling out situations with no true
lesion-symptom relations, but the spatial contiguity of stroke lesions may
cause identified lesion-symptom relations to extend beyond their true regions.

explicitly calculated for the first time. For this purpose, a novel solution to
the Klein-Gordon equation in the presence of a rotating electric field is
applied. An analytical expression for the emission rate is obtained, as well as
a simplified approximation adequate for emplementation in kinetic codes. The
spectrum is numerically calculated for nowadays optical and X-ray laser
parameters. The results are compared to the standard Volkov-Ritus rate for a
particle in a plane wave, which is commonly assumed to be valid for a rotating
electric field under certain conditions. Subsequent deviations between the two
models, both in the radiated power and the spectral shape, are demonstrated.
First, the typical number of photons participating in the scattering process is
much smaller compared to the Volkov-Ritus rate, resulting in up to an order of
magnitude lower emitted power. Furthermore, our model predicts a discrete
harmonics spectrum for electrons with low asymptotic momentum compared to the
field amplitude. This discrete structure is a clear imprint of the electric
field frequency, as opposed to the Volkov-Ritus rate which reduces to the
constant crossed field rate for the physical conditions under consideration.
Our model predictions can be tested with present-days laser facilities.

density, specific heat etc. follow usual acoustic phonon dynamics as have been
well studied by Debye. Other thermodynamic quantities like pressure, entropy
etc. have also been calculated. The usual Stefan-Boltzmann law gets modified.
We observe that the values of the thermodynamic quantities with the energy
cut-off is lower than the corresponding values in the theory without any such
scale. The phase-space measure is also expected to get modified for an exotic
spacetime appearing at Planck scale, which in turn leads to the modification of
Planck energy density distribution and the Wien's displacement law. We found
that the non-perturbative nature of the thermodynamic quantities in the SR
limit (for both the case with ultravilolet cut-off and the modified measure
case), due to nonanalyticity of the leading term, is a general feature of the
theory accompanied with an ultraviolet energy cut-off. We have also discussed
the possible modification in the case of Big Bang and the Stellar objects and
have suggested a table top experiment for verification in effective low energy
case.

the determination of maximal rank semidefinite moment matrices. Existing

  This paper is motivated by problems in the numerical computation of the real

  In this paper we give a method to compute the generators of the real radical
for any given degree $d$. We combine the use of moment matrices and techniques
from SDP optimization: facial reduction first developed by Borwein and
Wolkowicz. In use of the semidefinite moment matrices to compute the real
radical, the maximum rank property is very key, and with facial reduction, it
can be guaranteed with very high accuracy. Our algorithm can be used to test
the real radical membership of a given polynomial. In a special situation, we
can determine the real radical ideal in the positive dimensional case.

mean-field theory method for determining properties of ultracold atoms in a
trap. This approach goes beyond the well-known local density approximation and
at higher temperatures, in the normal phase, it shows why the local density
approximation works so well, since the local density and generalized gradient
approximations are essentially indistinguishable from each other (and from the
exact solution within full inhomogeneous dynamical mean-field theory). But
because the generalized gradient expansion only involves nearest-neighbor
corrections, it does not work as well at low temperatures, when the systems
enter into ordered phases. This is primarily due to the problem that ordered
phases often satisfy some global constraints which determine the spatial
ordering pattern, and the local density and generalized gradient approximations
are not able to impose those kinds of constraints; they also overestimate the
tendency to order. The theory is applied to phase separation of different mass
fermionic mixtures represented by the Falicov-Kimball model and to determining
the entropy per particle of a fermionic system represented by the Hubbard
model. The generalized gradient approximation is a useful diagnostic for the
accuracy of the local density approximation---when both methods agree, they are
likely accurate, when they disagree, neither is likely to be correct.

functional theory (KSDFT) framework, after revisiting the physics literature of

The PEXSI-$\Sigma$ method approximates the density matrix using a set of nearly
optimally chosen Green's functions evaluated at complex frequencies. For each
Green's function, the complex boundary conditions are described by a self
energy matrix $\Sigma$ constructed from a physical reference Green's function,
which can be computed relatively easily. In the linear regime, such treatment
of the boundary condition can be numerically exact. The support of the $\Sigma$
matrix is restricted to degrees of freedom near the boundary of computational
domain, and can be interpreted as a frequency dependent surface potential. This
makes it possible to perform KSDFT calculations with $\mathcal{O}(N^2)$
computational complexity, where $N$ is the number of atoms within the
computational domain. Green's function embedding methods are also naturally
compatible with atomistic Green's function methods for relaxing the atomic
configuration outside the computational domain. As a proof of concept, we
demonstrate the accuracy of the PEXSI-$\Sigma$ method for graphene with

However, in previous experimental studies, the effects of state-dependent

acting on the molecules while previous theoretical investigations took the
state-dependent molecular alignment into account only implicitly. Herein, we
consider the effects of molecular alignment explicitly and, to this end,
introduce an effective polarizability which takes proper account of molecular
alignment and is directly related to the alignment-dependent optical dipole
force. We illustrate the significance of including molecular alignment in the
optical dipole force by a trajectory study that compares previously used
approximations with the present approach. The trajectory simulations were
carried out for an ensemble of linear molecules subject to either propagating
or standing-wave optical fields for a range of temperatures and laser
intensities. The results demonstrate that the alignment-dependent effective
polarizability can serve to provide correct estimates of the optical dipole
force, on which a state-selection method applicable to nonpolar molecules could
be based. We note that an analogous analysis of the forces acting on polar
molecules subject to an inhomogeneous static electric field reveals a similarly
strong dependence on molecular orientation.

stable under specific equation of state of the phantom matter. We show that if
one does not use the above thin-shell matching, the wormhole, depending on the

wormholes cannot mimic effectively the ringing of a black hole at a few various
dominant multipoles at the same time, so that the future observations of

tutorials were developed via research in physics education and were found to be
effective for a diverse group of introductory physics students in one-on-one

self-paced learning environment by telling students that they would be helpful
for solving the assigned homework problems and that the underlying physics
principles in the tutorial problems would be similar to those in the in-class

struggled in the courses in which these adaptive e-learning tutorials were
assigned as a self-study tool, performed poorly on the paired problems. In
contrast, a majority of student volunteers in one-on-one implementation greatly
benefited from the tutorials and performed well on the paired problems. This
suggests that many students enrolled in introductory physics courses did not
effectively engage with the self-paced tutorials outside of class and may have
only used them superficially. The findings suggest that many students in need
of out-of-class remediation via self-paced learning tools may have difficulty
motivating themselves and may lack the self-regulation and time-management
skills to engage effectively with tools specially designed to help them learn

ZFIRE survey. Our sample consists of 75 Ks-band selected star-forming galaxies
from the ZFOURGE survey with stellar masses ranging from
log(M$_{\star}$/M$_{\odot}$)$=9.0-11.0$, 28 of which are members of a known
overdensity at $z=2.095$. We measure H$\alpha$ emission-line integrated
velocity dispersions ($\sigma_{\rm int}$) from 50$-$230 km s$^{-1}$, consistent
with other emission-line studies of $z\sim2$ field galaxies. From these data we
estimate virial, stellar, and gas masses and derive correlations between these
properties for cluster and field galaxies at $z\sim2$. We find evidence that
baryons dominate within the central effective radius. However, we find no
statistically significant differences between the cluster and the field, and
conclude that the kinematics of star-forming galaxies at $z\sim2$ are not
significantly different between the cluster and field environments.

Extending the targets to stereoscopic molecules, it is shown that the allowed

size polydisperse LJ liquids are Roskilde-simple (RS) liquids. RS liquids are
liquids with strong correlation between constant volume equilibrium
fluctuations of virial and potential energy and are simpler than other types of
liquids. Moreover, it was shown that size polydisperse LJ liquids have
isomorphs to a good approximation. Isomorphs are curves in the phase diagram of
RS liquids along which structure, dynamics, and some thermodynamic quantities
are invariant in dimensionless (reduced) units. In this paper, we study the
effect of energy polydispersity on the nature of LJ liquids. We show that
energy polydisperse LJ liquids are RS liquids. However, a tendency of particle
segregation which increases with the degree of polydispersity leads to a loss
of strong virial-potential energy correlation, but is mitigated with increasing
temperature and/or density. Isomorphs are a good approximation also for energy
polydisperse LJ liquids, although particle-resolved quantities display a
somewhat poorer scaling compared to the mean quantities along the isomorph.

to realizing the vision of Internet of Things (IoT) into reality by supporting
heterogeneous objects interconnection in a large scale network. These devices
may be many types of objects with embedded intelligence and communication
capabilities, e.g., smart phones, cars, or home appliances. The issue in in
this type of communication is the interference to cellular communication caused
by D2D communication. Thus, proper power control and resource allocation should
be coordinated in D2D network to prevent excessive interference and drastic
decrease in the throughput of the cellular system. In this paper, we consider
the problem of cross-layer resource allocation in time-varying cellular
wireless networks with D2D communication and incorporate average interference
to cellular system as a quality-of-service constraint. Specifically, each D2D
pair in the network injects packets to its queue, at rates chosen in order to
maximize a global utility function, subject to network stability and
interference constraints. The interference constraint enforces an arbitrarily
low interference to the cellular system caused by D2D communication. We first
obtain the stability region for the multiuser systems assuming that the nodes
have full channel state information (CSI) of their neighbors. Then, we provide
a joint flow control and scheduling scheme, which is proven to achieve a
utility arbitrarily close to the maximum achievable utility. Finally, we
address the consequences of practical implementation issue such as distributed

  approach",,,,,"q-bio.CB","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  A ubiquitous feature of living cells is their growth over time followed by
division into daughter cells. How isogenic cell populations maintain size
homeostasis, i.e., a narrow distribution of cell size, is an intriguing
fundamental problem. We model cell size using a stochastic hybrid system, where
a cell grows exponentially in size (volume) over time and probabilistic
division events are triggered at discrete time intervals. Moreover, whenever
division events occur, size is randomly partitioned among daughter cells. We
first consider a scenario, where a timer (i.e., cell-cycle clock) that measures
the time since the last division event regulates both the cellular growth and
division rates. Analysis reveals that such a timer-controlled system cannot
achieve size homeostasis, in the sense that, the cell-to-cell size variation
grows unboundedly with time. To explore biologically meaningful mechanisms for
controlling size we consider two classes of regulation: a size-dependent growth
rate and a size-dependent division rate. Our results show that these strategies
can provide bounded intercellular variation in cell size, and exact
mathematical conditions on the form of regulation needed for size homeostasis
are derived. Different known forms of size control strategies, such as, the
adder and the sizer are shown to be consistent with these results.
Interestingly, for timer-based division mechanisms, the mean cell size depends
on the noise in the cell-cycle duration but independent of errors incurred in
partitioning of volume among daughter cells. In contrast, the mean cell size
decreases with increasing partitioning errors for size-based division
mechanisms. Finally, we discuss how organisms ranging from bacteria to
mammalian cells have adopted different control approaches for maintaining size
homeostasis.

the derived perception system has a fast training phase and can work with small

which are common with 3D sensors. We contribute by presenting a comparative

candidates on the standard Cornell dataset. Importantly, experimental results
show a performance improvement of 1.69% in detection and 3.16% in recognition

Given covariates, random effects and process history, the observed responses at

distribution. We develop maximum likelihood estimation of the mixed effects
model using an observation driven generalized linear autoregressive moving
average specification for the serial dependence in each series. The paper
presents an easily implementable approach which uses existing single time
series methods to handle the serial dependence structure in combination with
adaptive Gaussian quadrature to approximate the integrals over the regression
random effects required for the likelihood and its derivatives. The models and
methods presented allow extension of existing mixed model procedures for count

across the individual series. The structure of the model has some similarities
to longitudinal data transition models with random effects. However, in
contrast to that setting, where there are many cases and few to moderate
observations per case, the time series setting has many observations per series

this equation numerically we confirm that the odderon amplitude decreases
faster in the nonlinear case than in the linear BFKL limit. We also point out

using interaction between the Rydberg atoms during the storage and retrieval of
slow light. A distinctive feature of the suggested procedure is that the slow
light is stored into a superposition of two atomic coherences under conditions
of electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT). Interaction between the
atoms during the storage period creates entangled pairs of atoms in a
superposition state that is orthogonal to the initially stored state. Restoring
the slow light from this new atomic state one can produce a two photon state
with a second-order correlation function determined by the atom-atom
interaction and the storage time. Therefore the measurement of the restored
light allows one to probe the atom-atom coupling by optical means with a
sensitivity that can be increased by extending the storage time. As a
realization of this idea we consider a many-body Ramsey-type technique which
involves pi/2 pulses creating a superposition of Rydberg states at the
beginning and the end of the storage period. In that case the regenerated light
is due to the resonance dipole-dipole interaction between the atoms in the
Rydberg states.

active elements affects the global connectivity in the network may be an
important practical question to ask. Here a new model of percolation phenomena,
with an additional source of disorder, has been introduced for a theoretical
understanding of this problem. As in ordinary percolation, sites of a square
lattice are occupied randomly with the probability $p$. Each occupied site is
then assigned a circular disc of random value $R$ for its radius. A bond is
defined to be occupied if and only if the radii $R_1$ and $R_2$ of the discs
centered at the ends satisfy certain pre-defined condition. In a very general
formulation, one divides the $R_1 - R_2$ plane into two regions by an arbitrary
closed curve. One defines that a point within one region represents an occupied
bond, otherwise it is a vacant bond. Study of three different rules under this
general formulation, indicates that the percolation threshold is always larger
and varies continuously. This threshold has two limiting values, one is
$p_c$(sq), the percolation threshold for the ordinary site percolation on the
square lattice and the other being unity. The variation of the thresholds are
characterized by exponents, which are not known in the literature. In a special
case, all lattice sites are occupied by discs of random radii $R \in \{0,R_0\}$
and a percolation transition is observed with $R_0$ as the control variable,
similar to the site occupation probability.

systems where planets with a moon are widely separated from their host stars.
From this investigation, we find that the moon feature generally appears as an
very short-duration perturbation on the smooth asymmetric light curve of the
lensing event induced by the wide separation planet; thus it can be easily
discriminated from the planet feature responsible for the overall asymmetric
light curve. For typical Galactic lensing events with the Einstein radius of
$\sim 2$ AU, the asymmetry of the light curves due to bound planets can be
noticed up to $\sim 20$AU. We also find that the perturbations of the wide
planetary systems become dominated by the moon as the projected star-planet
separation increases, and eventually the light curves of events produced by the
systems appear as the single lensing light curve of the planet itself with a
very short-duration perturbation induced by the moon, which is a representative
light curve of the event induced by a star and a planet, except on the Einstein
timescale of the planet. We also study the effect of a finite source star on
the moon feature in the wide planetary lensing events. From this study, we find
that when the lunar caustic is sufficiently separated from the planetary
caustic, the lower limit on the ratio of the lunar caustic size to the source
radius causing a $\geq 5\%$ lunar deviation depends mostly on the projected
planet-moon separation regardless of the moon/star mass ratio, and it decreases
as the planet-moon separation becomes smaller or larger than the planetary
Einstein radius.

zonal-mean circulation to reduced air-sea momentum roughness ($Z_{0m}$) at low
flow speed is investigated with the Community Atmosphere Model (CAM3). In an
aquaplanet framework with prescribed sea surface temperatures, the response to
reduced $Z_{0m}$ resembles the La Ni$\tilde{\text{n}}$a minus El
Ni$\tilde{\text{n}}$o response to El Ni$\tilde{\text{n}}$o Southern Oscillation
variability with: i) a poleward shift of the mid-latitude westerlies extending
all the way to the surface; ii) a weak poleward shift of the subtropical
descent region; and iii) a weakening of the Hadley circulation, which is
generally also accompanied by a poleward shift of the inter-tropical
convergence zone (ITCZ) and the tropical surface easterlies. Mechanism-denial
experiments show this response to be initiated by the reduction of tropical
latent and sensible heat fluxes, effected by reducing $Z_{0m}$. The circulation
response is elucidated by considering the effect of the tropical energy fluxes
on the Hadley circulation strength, the upper tropospheric critical layer
latitudes, and the lower-tropospheric baroclinic eddy forcing. The ITCZ shift
is understood via moist static energy budget analysis in the tropics. The
circulation response to reduced $Z_{0m}$ carries over to more complex setups
with seasonal cycle, full complexity of atmosphere-ice-land-ocean interaction,
and a slab ocean lower boundary condition. Hence, relatively small changes in
the surface parameterization parameters can lead to a significant circulation
response.

deep neural networks (DNN) recently. Such framework typically employs the Model
Average approach, denoted as MA-DNN, in which parallel workers conduct
respective training based on their own local data while the parameters of local
models are periodically communicated and averaged to obtain a global model
which serves as the new start of local models. However, since DNN is a highly
non-convex model, averaging parameters cannot ensure that such global model can
perform better than those local models. To tackle this problem, we introduce a
new parallel training framework called Ensemble-Compression, denoted as EC-DNN.
In this framework, we propose to aggregate the local models by ensemble, i.e.,
averaging the outputs of local models instead of the parameters. As most of
prevalent loss functions are convex to the output of DNN, the performance of
ensemble-based global model is guaranteed to be at least as good as the average
performance of local models. However, a big challenge lies in the explosion of
model size since each round of ensemble can give rise to multiple times size
increment. Thus, we carry out model compression after each ensemble,
specialized by a distillation based method in this paper, to reduce the size of
the global model to be the same as the local ones. Our experimental results
demonstrate the prominent advantage of EC-DNN over MA-DNN in terms of both
accuracy and speedup.

identification in summarization systems. This paper introduces a novel approach
to labeling a group of n-grams comprising an individual topic. The approach
taken is to complement the existing topic distributions over words with a known
distribution based on a predefined set of topics. This is done by integrating
existing labeled knowledge sources representing known potential topics into the
probabilistic topic model. These knowledge sources are translated into a
distribution and used to set the hyperparameters of the Dirichlet generated
distribution over words. In the inference these modified distributions guide
the convergence of the latent topics to conform with the complementary
distributions. This approach ensures that the topic inference process is
consistent with existing knowledge. The label assignment from the complementary
knowledge sources are then transferred to the latent topics of the corpus. The
results show both accurate label assignment to topics as well as improved topic
generation than those obtained using various labeling approaches based off
Latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA).

consideration for steric hindrance due to the large bond length of CO2. We
calculated the occupation function for CO2 using the Tolman cone angle, which
shows that three CO2 molecules fully occupy the available space around Sc- and

strong increase in filament propagation in the bi-normal direction and a
significant decrease in net radial propagation. Both effects arise from the
temperature dependence of the sheath current which leads to a non-uniform
floating potential, with the latter effect supplemented by faster pressure
loss. The reduction in radial velocity can only occur when the filament

that the proposed criterion exceeds a conventionally derived existing criterion

unsteady flow fields, we deduce a recurrence process which enables the generic
representation of pseudo-periodic motion at high spatial and temporal

CFD. While a first, Eulerian Model A solves a passive transport equation in a
classical implicit finite-volume environment, a second, Lagrangian Model B

very good agreement with full CFD simulations, while computational times are
dramatically reduced. Actually, recurrence CFD is a promising candidate for
online simulations of passive transport processes at full CFD resolution, which

their role on the transport and entry of localized plasma jets similar to those
identified inside the Earth's magnetosheath propagating towards the

field inside the main bulk of the plasma cloud that enables its forward
transport and entry across the transverse magnetic field. The jet is able to
penetrate the transition region when the height of the magnetic barrier does
not exceed a certain critical threshold. Otherwise, the forward transport along
the injection direction is stopped before full penetration of the magnetopause.
Moreover, the jet is pushed back and simultaneously deflected in the
perpendicular plane to the magnetic field. Our simulations evidence physical
processes advocated previously by the theoretical model of impulsive

construct a general interpolating field for each baryon with parameters
specifying the strength of independent interpolating fields. Optimal choices

binary, the accreted gas settles onto the stellar surface through a
boundary/spreading layer. On rare occasions the accumulated gas undergoes a
powerful thermonuclear superburst powered by carbon burning deep below the
neutron star atmosphere. In this paper, we apply the non-negative matrix
factorization spectral decomposition technique to show that the spectral
variations during a superburst from 4U 1636-536 can be explained by two
distinct components: 1) the superburst emission characterized by a variable
temperature black body radiation component, and 2) a quasi-Planckian component
with a constant, $\sim$2.5 keV, temperature varying by a factor of $\sim$15 in
flux. The spectrum of the quasi-Planckian component is identical in shape and
characteristics to the frequency-resolved spectra observed in the
accretion/persistent spectrum of neutron star low-mass X-ray binaries, and
agrees well with the predictions of the spreading layer model by Inogamov &
Sunyaev (1999). Our result is yet another observational evidence that
superbursts - and possibly also normal X-ray bursts - induce changes in the

parameters or on solving unconstrained combinatorial optimization problems such
as the traveling salesman problems. In this paper, a subpopulation-based
genetic al-gorithm that uses only mutation and selection is developed to solve
multi-robot task allocation problems. The target problems are constrained
combinatorial optimization problems, and are more complex if cooperative tasks
are involved as these introduce additional spatial and temporal constraints.
The proposed genetic algorithm can obtain better solutions than classical
genetic algorithms with tournament selection and partially mapped crossover.
The performance of different mutation operators in solving problems
without/with cooperative tasks is evaluated. The results imply that inversion
mutation performs better than others when solving problems without cooperative

solving problems with cooperative tasks.

this, we modify the memory function formalism with respect to the

transformation-induced slip which co-evolves with the phase transformation,
thus ensuring the crossing of a critical manifold. Our conclusions are based on
a model where annealed disorder emerges in the form of a random field induced
by the phase transition. Such disorder exhibits super-transient chaotic
behavior under thermal loading, obeys a heavy-tailed distribution and exhibits
long-range spatial correlations. We show that the universality class is
affected by the long-range character of elastic interactions. In contrast, it

enforce correct monomer packing. We generate $15$ melts of $500$ chains of

the solar core triggered by fast reaction-produced particles is formulated. It
essentially extends an approach to study suprathermal solar reactions discussed
previously [Phys. Rev. C 91, 028801 (2015)] and refines its predictions. The
model is applied to examine in detail the slowing-down of 8.7-MeV alpha
particles produced in the 7Li(p,alpha)alpha reaction of the pp chain, and to
study suprathermal processes in the solar CNO cycle induced by them. The
influence of electron degeneracy and electron screening on suprathermal
reactions through in-flight reaction probability and fast particle emission
rate is clarified. In particular, these effects account for a 20% increase of
the 14N(alpha,p)17O reaction rate at R < 0.2Rsun. This new type of correction
is important for the suprathermal reaction like 14N(alpha,p)17O as it is
recognized to be capable of distorting the CNO cycle in the 95% region of the
solar core. In this region, normal branching 14N <-- 17O --> 18F of nuclear
flow transforms to abnormal sequential flow 14N --> 17O --> 18F, and the
14N(alpha,p)17O reaction rate exceeds the rate of 17O burn up through
conventional 17O(p,alpha)14N and 17O(p,gamma)18F processes. It is shown that
these factors can enhance the 17O abundance in the core as compared with
standard estimates. For the steady state case, the abundance enhancement is
estimated to be as high as ~ 100 in the outer core region. A conjecture is made
that other CNO suprathermal (alpha,p) reactions may also alter abundances of
CNO elements, including those generating solar neutrinos.

improves the interpretability of the estimated coefficients and is desirable in
the functional framework for which small shifts are frequent when comparing one

framework based on Sliced Inverse Regression (SIR). SIR is an effective method
for dimension reduction of high-dimensional data which computes a linear
projection of the predictors in a low-dimensional space, without loss on
regression information. We extend the approaches of variable selection
developed for multidimensional SIR to select intervals rather than separated
evaluation points in the definition domain of the functional predictors.
Different and equivalent formulations of SIR are combined in a shrinkage
approach with a group-LASSO-like penalty. Finally, a fully automated iterative
procedure is also proposed to find the critical (interpretable) intervals. The

applications in natural language processing. In this paper we shed light on
estimating query vectors in ad-hoc retrieval where a limited information is
available in the original query. Pseudo-relevance feedback (PRF) is a
well-known technique for updating query language models and expanding the
queries with a number of relevant terms. We formulate the query updating in
low-dimensional spaces first with rotating the query vector and then with
scaling. These consequential steps are embedded in a query-specific projection
matrix capturing both angle and scaling. In this paper we propose a new but not
the most effective technique necessarily for PRF in language modeling, based on
the query projection algorithm. We learn an embedded coefficient matrix for
each query, whose aim is to improve the vector representation of the query by
transforming it to a more reliable space, and then update the query language
model. The proposed embedded coefficient divergence minimization model (ECDMM)
takes top-ranked documents retrieved by the query and obtains a couple of
positive and negative sample sets; these samples are used for learning the
coefficient matrix which will be used for projecting the query vector and
updating the query language model using a softmax function. Experimental
results on several TREC and CLEF data sets in several languages demonstrate
effectiveness of ECDMM. The experimental results reveal that the new
formulation for the query works as well as state-of-the-art PRF techniques and
outperforms state-of-the-art PRF techniques in a TREC collection in terms of
MAP,P@5, and P@10 significantly.

strengthen and extend in this paper some recent results by Di Nasso, Goldbring,

countable \textsc{amenable} groups to general countable measured groups. We
point out several fundamental differences between the behavior of products of
""large"" sets in Liouville and non-Liouville measured groups.
  As a (very) special case of our main results, we show that if $G$ is a free
group of finite rank, and $A$ and $B$ are ""spherically large"" subsets of $G$,
then there exists a finite set $F \subset G$ such that $AFB$ is thick. The
position of the set $F$ is curious, but seems to be necessary; in fact, we can
produce \emph{left thick} sets $A, B \subset G$ such that $B$ is ""spherically
large"", but $AB$ is \emph{not} piecewise syndetic. On the other hand, if $A$ is
spherically large, then $AA^{-1}$ is always piecewise syndetic \emph{and} left
piecewise syndetic. However, contrary to what happens for amenable groups,
$AA^{-1}$ may fail to be syndetic. The same phenomena occur for many other
(even amenable, but non-Liouville) measured groups.
  Our proofs are based on some ergodic-theoretical results concerning
stationary actions which should be of independent interest.

point correlation functions, we find that the leading contribution is given by
structures related to geodesics connecting the operators inserted at the

three point functions. This is highly suggestive of the emergence of the
analogues of Witten diagrams in the tensor network. The perturbations alone
however do not give the right entanglement spectrum. Using the Coxeter

components is a rapidly rotating magnetic white dwarf is studied. The main
example considered is the AE Aquarii system; the spin period of the white dwarf
is about a factor of 1000 shorter than the orbital period, and the magnetic
field on the white dwarf surface is of order of 50 MG. The mass transfer in
this system was analyzed via numerical solution of the system of MHD equations.
These computations show that the magnetic field of the white dwarf does not
significantly influence the velocity field of the material in its Roche lobe in
the case of laminar flow regime, so that the field does not hinder the
formation of a transient disk (ring) surrounding the magnetosphere. However,
the efficiency of the energy and angular momentum exchange between the white
dwarf and the surrounding material increases considerably with the development
of turbulent motions in the matter, resulting in its acceleration at the
magnetospheric boundary and further escape from the system at a high rate. The
time scales of the transition of the system between the laminar and turbulent
modes are close to those of the AE\,Aqr transition between its quiet and active
phases.

use in particular of rank metric codes. When the classical approach consists in
finding the unique preimage of a syndrome through a decoding algorithm, we
propose to introduce the notion of mixed decoding of erasures and errors for
building signature schemes. In that case the difficult problem becomes, as is
the case in lattice-based cryptography, finding a preimage of weight above the
Gilbert-Varshamov bound (case where many solutions occur) rather than finding a
unique preimage of weight below the Gilbert-Varshamov bound. The paper
describes RankSign: a new signature algorithm for the rank metric based on a
new mixed algorithm for decoding erasures and errors for the recently
introduced Low Rank Parity Check (LRPC) codes. We explain how it is possible
(depending on choices of parameters) to obtain a full decoding algorithm which
is able to find a preimage of reasonable rank weight for any random syndrome
with a very strong probability. We study the semantic security of our signature
algorithm and show how it is possible to reduce the unforgeability to direct
attacks on the public matrix, so that no information leaks through signatures.
Finally, we give several examples of parameters for our scheme, some of which
with public key of size $11,520$ bits and signature of size $1728$ bits.
Moreover the scheme can be very fast for small base fields.

aggregation (QoA) is determined by the number of participating nodes in the
data aggregation process. The previous studies have attempted to propose
optimal scheduling algorithms to obtain the maximum QoA assuming a fixed
underlying aggregation tree. However, there exists no prior work to address the
issue of constructing optimal aggregation tree in deadline-constraints WSNs.
The structure of underlying aggregation tree is important since our analysis
demonstrates that the ratio between the maximum achievable QoAs of different
trees could be as large as O(2^D), where D is the deadline. This paper casts a
combinatorial optimization problem to address optimal tree construction for
deadline-constrained data aggregation in WSNs. While the problem is proved to
be NP-hard, we employ the recently proposed Markov approximation framework and
devise two distributed algorithms with different computation overheads to find
close-to-optimal solutions with bounded approximation gap. To further improve
the convergence of the proposed Markov-based algorithms, we devise another
initial tree construction algorithm with low computational complexity. Our
extensive experiments for a set randomly-generated scenarios demonstrate that
the proposed algorithms outperforms the existing alternative methods by
obtaining better quality of aggregations.

process, characterized by a persistence time and an effective temperature, and
particles interact via a Lennard-Jones potential that yields well-studied
glassy behavior in the Brownian limit, obtained as the persistence time
vanishes. By increasing the persistence time, the system departs more strongly
from thermal equilibrium and we provide a comprehensive numerical analysis of
the structure and dynamics of the resulting active fluid. Finite persistence
times profoundly affect the static structure of the fluid and give rise to
nonequilibrium velocity correlations that are absent in thermal systems.
Despite these nonequilibrium features, for any value of the persistence time we
observe a nonequilibrium glass transition as the effective temperature is
decreased. Surprisingly, increasing departure from thermal equilibrium is found
to promote (rather than suppress) the glassy dynamics. Overall, our results
suggest that with increasing persistence time, microscopic properties of the

electrons[2]. While this surprising theorem has been exploited in sophisticated
quantum phenomena[13-15] such as ultrastrong light-matter coupling[16],
superradiance[17], and coherent control[18], the complete absence of
nonlinearities excludes many intriguing possibilities, such as quantum-logic
protocols[19]. Here, we use intense terahertz pulses to drive the cyclotron
response of a two-dimensional electron gas beyond the protective limits of
Kohn's theorem. Anharmonic Landau ladder climbing and distinct terahertz four-
and six-wave mixing signatures occur, which our theory links to dynamic Coulomb
effects between electrons and the positively charged ion background. This new
context for Kohn's theorem unveils previously inaccessible internal degrees of
freedom of Landau electrons, opening up new realms of ultrafast quantum control
for electrons.

the form $p(t,x,x)\le F_1(x)F_2(t)$ for all $(x,t)\in X\times\mathbb{R_+}$; we
refer to $F_1$ as the \emph{control function}. We show that such an estimate
leads to rather satisfying abstract results on relative compactness of
perturbations of $H$ by potentials. It came as a surprise to us, however, that
such an estimate holds for the Laplace-Beltrami operator on \emph{any}
Riemannian manifold. In particular, using a domination principle, one can
deduce from the latter fact a very general result on the relative compactness
of perturbations by potentials of the Bochner Laplacian associated with a
Hermitian bundle $(E, h^E,\nabla^E)$ over an arbitrary Riemannian manifold
$(M,g)$; in fact, only quantities of order zero in $g$ enter in the estimates.
We extend this result to weighted Riemannian manifolds, where under lower
curvature bounds on the $\alpha$-Bakry-\'{E}mery tensor one can construct quite
explicit control functions, and to any weighted graph, where the control
function is expressed in terms of the vertex weight function.

experiments that can be shifted by electric fields, allowing for charge
transport whenever energy levels of neighboring particles match. Hence, the
state of the device changes sequentially between conducting and non-conducting
instead of just one transition from conducting to pinch-off as in

necessary to use uniform nanoparticles in ordered arrays separated by
well-defined tunnel barriers. In this work, CoPt nanoparticles with a narrow

However, most existing Schatten quasi-norm minimization (SQNM) algorithms, as
well as for nuclear norm minimization, are too slow or even impractical for
large-scale problems, due to the SVD or EVD of the whole matrix in each
iteration. In this paper, we rigorously prove that for any p, p1, p2>0

to minimizing the product of the Schatten-p1 norm (or quasi-norm) and
Schatten-p2 norm (or quasi-norm) of its two factor matrices. Then we present
and prove the equivalence relationship between the product formula of the
Schatten quasi-norm and its weighted sum formula for the two cases of p1 and
p2: p1=p2 and p1\neq p2. In particular, when p>1/2, there is an equivalence
between the Schatten-p quasi-norm of any matrix and the Schatten-2p norms of
its two factor matrices, where the widely used equivalent formulation of the
nuclear norm can be viewed as a special case. That is, various SQNM problems
with p>1/2 can be transformed into the one only involving smooth, convex norms
of two factor matrices, which can lead to simpler and more efficient algorithms
than conventional methods.
  We further extend the theoretical results of two factor matrices to the cases
of three and more factor matrices, from which we can see that for any 0<p<1,
the Schatten-p quasi-norm of any matrix is the minimization of the mean of the
Schatten-(p3+1)p norms of all factor matrices, where p3 denotes the largest
integer not exceeding 1/p. In other words, for any 0<p<1, the SQNM problem can
be transformed into an optimization problem only involving the smooth, convex

cross-ratio identities, which provides an analytic and easy to implement method

given CHY-integrand containing higher-order poles as a linear combination of
CHY-integrands with only simple poles in a finite number of steps, which
ultimately can be trivially evaluated by integration rules of simple poles. To
make the method even more efficient for CHY-integrands with large number of
particles and complicated higher-order pole structures, we combine the
$\Lambda$-algorithm and the cross-ratio identities, and as a by-product it
provides us a way to deal with CHY-integrands where the $\Lambda$-algorithm was
not applicable in its original formulation.

noise in the receiver, namely the problem of estimating and compensating for
the impairment. To lessen the computational burden and delay incurred onto the
receiver, we estimate phase noise using only scattered pilot subcarriers, i.e.,
no tentative symbol decisions are used in obtaining and improving the phase
noise estimate. In particular, the phase noise estimation problem is posed as
an unconstrained optimization problem whose minimizer suffers from the
so-called amplitude and phase estimation error. These errors arise due to
receiver noise, estimation from limited scattered pilot subcarriers and
estimation using a dimensionality reduction model. It is empirically shown
that, at high signal-to-noise-ratios, the phase estimation error is small. To
reduce the amplitude estimation error, we restrict the minimizer to be drawn
from the so-called phase noise geometry set when minimizing the cost function.
The resulting optimization problem is a non-convex program. However, using the
S-procedure for quadratic equalities, we show that the optimal solution can be
obtained by solving the convex dual problem. We also consider a less complex
heuristic scheme that achieves the same objective of restricting the minimizer
to the phase noise geometry set. Through simulations, we demonstrate improved
coded bit-error-rate and phase noise estimation error performance when
enforcing the phase noise geometry. For example, at high
signal-to-noise-ratios, the probability density function of the phase noise
estimation error exhibits thinner tails which results in lower bit-error-rate.

extremal black holes are modified by a one form associated with the vector

vector forms thermodynamic conjugates with the graviton mode and partly
contributes to the one form modifying the first laws. For a minimally coupled
theory with $\Lambda_0\neq 0$, we also obtain one class of asymptotically flat
extremal black hole solutions in general dimensions. This is possible because
the parameters $(m^2,\gamma_4)$ take certain values such that $V=0$. In
particular, we find that the vector also forms thermodynamic conjugates with

transition scenarios not observed in 3D systems, but these phases depend
sensitively on the system and thus predicting how any given 2D system will
behave remains a challenge. Here we report a comprehensive simulation study of
the phase behavior near the melting transition of all hard regular polygons
with $3\leq n\leq 14$ vertices using massively parallel Monte Carlo simulations
of up to one million particles. By investigating this family of shapes, we show
that the melting transition depends upon both particle shape and symmetry
considerations, which together can predict which of three different melting
scenarios will occur for a given $n$. We show that systems of polygons with as
few as seven edges behave like hard disks; they melt continuously from a solid
to a hexatic fluid and then undergo a first-order transition from the hexatic
phase to the fluid phase. We show that this behavior, which holds for all
$7\leq n\leq 14$, arises from weak entropic forces among the particles. Strong
directional entropic forces align polygons with fewer than seven edges and
impose local order in the fluid. These forces can enhance or suppress the
discontinuous character of the transition depending on whether the local order
in the fluid is compatible with the local order in the solid. As a result,
systems of triangles, squares, and hexagons exhibit a KTHNY-type continuous
transition between fluid and hexatic, tetratic, and hexatic phases,
respectively, and a continuous transition from the appropriate ""x""-atic to the

reactions is strongly hindered by the quasifission (QF) mechanism which
prevents the formation of an equilibrated compound nucleus and which depends on
the structure of the reactants. New SHE have been recently produced with
doubly-magic $^{48}$Ca beams. However, SHE synthesis experiments with
single-magic $^{50}$Ti beams have so far been unsuccessful. Purpose: In
connection with experimental searches for $Z=117,119$ superheavy elements, we
perform a theoretical study of fusion and quasifission mechanisms in
$^{48}$Ca,$^{50}$Ti+$^{249}$Bk reactions in order to investigate possible
differences in reaction mechanisms induced by these two projectiles. Methods:
The collision dynamics and the outcome of the reactions are studied using
unrestricted time-dependent Hartree-Fock (TDHF) calculations as well as the
density-constrained TDHF method to extract the nucleus-nucleus potentials and
the excitation energy in each fragment. Results: Nucleus-nucleus potentials,
nuclear contact times, masses and charges of the fragments, as well as their
kinetic and excitation energies strongly depend on the orientation of the
prolate $^{249}$Bk nucleus. Long contact times associated with fusion are
observed in collisions of both projectiles with the side of the $^{249}$Bk
nucleus, but not on collisions with its tip. The energy and impact parameter
dependences of the fragment properties, as well as their mass-angle and
mass-total kinetic energy correlations are investigated. Conclusions: Entrance
channel reaction dynamics are similar with both $^{48}$Ca and $^{50}$Ti
projectiles. Both are expected to lead to the formation of a compound nucleus
by fusion if they have enough energy to get in contact with the side of the
$^{249}$Bk target.

Our analysis is based on data obtained using smartphones equipped with custom

of social contacts is represented as a weighted multilayer network constructed
from different channels of telecommunication as well as data on face-to-face

individuals. In contrast, several socio-demographics variables have a
significant degree of similarity. We further observe that similarity might be
present in one layer of the multilayer network and simultaneously be absent in
the other layers. For a variable such as gender, our measure reveals a
transition from similarity between nodes connected with links of relatively low
weight to dis-similarity for the nodes connected by the strongest links. We
finally analyze the overlap between layers in the network for different levels

diffusivity and the randomness of stochastic Lagrangian trajectories for flows
without bounding walls. This ""Lagrangian fluctuation-dissipation relation""
equates the scalar dissipation for either passive or active scalars to the
variance of scalar inputs associated to initial scalar values and internal
scalar sources, as those are sampled backward in time by the stochastic
Lagrangian trajectories. As an important application, we reconsider the
phenomenon of ""Lagrangian spontaneous stochasticity"" or persistent
non-determinism of Lagrangian particle trajectories in the limit of vanishing
viscosity and diffusivity. Previous work on the Kraichnan (1968) model of
turbulent scalar advection has shown that anomalous scalar dissipation is
associated in that model to Lagrangian spontaneous stochasticity. There has
been controversy, however, regarding the validity of this mechanism for scalars
advected by an actual turbulent flow. We here completely resolve this
controversy by exploiting the fluctuation-dissipation relation. For either a
passive or active scalar advected by any divergence-free velocity field,
including solutions of the incompressible Navier-Stokes equation, and away from
walls, we prove that anomalous scalar dissipation requires Lagrangian
spontaneous stochasticity. For passive scalars we prove furthermore that
spontaneous stochasticity yields anomalous dissipation for suitable initial
scalar distributions, so that the two phenomena are there completely
equivalent. These points are illustrated by numerical results from a database
of homogeneous, isotropic turbulence, which provide both additional support to
the results and physical insight into the representation of diffusive effects
by stochastic Lagrangian particle trajectories.

sources of the latter uncertainty is the poor perturbative behaviour of the
short-distance contribution of the box diagram with two charm quarks. In this
proceeding, based on arXiv:1602.08494, I summarise how that contribution can be
removed, from the imaginary part of the mixing amplitude, by a rephasing of the
kaon fields. A first outcome is a mild reduction of the total theoretical
uncertainty of epsilon_K: while this might look counterintuitive at first
sight, if different ""pieces"" (i.e. short- and long-distance) of an observable
are computed with different techniques, then it is possible to choose a phase
convention where the total uncertainty of that observable is optimised.
Moreover, it is worthy to discuss if and how this freedom of rephasing, which
has been somehow overlooked in the past, can help in making progress in lattice
QCD computations of immediate relevance for epsilon_K.

experimental limit to the spin-dependent interactions can be significantly
improved over existing experiments, and new limits on the coupling strengths
can be set in the interaction range below 0.01 m.

  Parking Stations","8 pages",,,,"cs.SY","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Nowadays, there has been a rapid growth in global usage of the electronic
vehicles (EV). Despite apparent environmental and economic advantages of EVs,
their high demand charging jobs pose an immense challenge to the existing
electricity grid infrastructure. In microgrids, as the small-scale version of
traditional power grid, however, the EV charging scheduling is more
challenging. This is because, the microgrid owner, as a large electricity
customer, is interested in shaving its global peak demand, i.e., the aggregated
demand over multiple parking stations, to reduce total electricity cost. While
the EV charging scheduling problem in single station scenario has been studied
extensively in the previous research, the microgrid-level problem with multiple
stations subject to a global peak constraint is not tackled. This paper aims to
propose a near-optimal EV charging scheduling mechanism in a microgrid governed
by a single utility provider with multiple charging stations. The goal is to
maximize the total revenue while respecting both local and global peak
constraints. The underlying problem, however, is a NP-hard mixed integer linear
problem which is difficult to tackle and calls for approximation algorithm
design. We design a primaldual scheduling algorithm which runs in polynomial
time and achieves bounded approximation ratio. Moreover, the proposed global
scheduling algorithm applies a valley-filling strategy to further reduce the
global peak. Simulation results show that the performance of the proposed
algorithm is 98% of the optimum, which is much better than the theoretical
bound obtained by our approximation analysis. Our algorithm reduces the peak
demand obtained by the existing alternative algorithm by 16% and simultaneously
achieves better resource utilization.

the functional connectivity between multichannel (4x4 matrix) EHG signals
recorded from the women abdomen. The proposed pipeline includes i) the
computation of the statistical couplings between the multichannel EHG signals,
ii) the characterization of the connectivity matrices, computed by using the
imaginary part of the coherence, based on the graph-theory analysis and iii)
the use of these measures for pregnancy monitoring. The method was evaluated on
a dataset of EHGs, in order to track the correlation between EHGs collected by
each electrode of the matrix (called node-wise analysis) and follow their
evolution along weeks before labor. Results showed that the strength of each
node significantly increases from pregnancy to labor. Electrodes located on the
median vertical axis of the uterus seemed to be the more discriminant. We
speculate that the network-based analysis can be a very promising tool to
improve pregnancy monitoring.

large-scale figure errors we employ low-order Zernike polynomials (power and
