decades, where some theoretical bounds on its performance were identified and
where practical optimizations were proposed for making it work fairly well in
high dimensional spaces and on large datasets. From countless experiments of
the past it became widely accepted that the value of k has a significant impact
on the performance of this method. However, the efficient optimization of this
parameter has not received so much attention in literature. Today, the most
common approach is to cross-validate or bootstrap this value for all values in
question. This approach forces distances to be recomputed many times, even if
efficient methods are used. Hence, estimating the optimal k can become
expensive even on modern systems. Frequently, this circumstance leads to a
sparse manual search of k. In this paper we want to point out that a systematic
and thorough estimation of the parameter k can be performed efficiently. The
discussed approach relies on large matrices, but we want to argue, that in
practice a higher space complexity is often much less of a problem than
repetitive distance computations.

to a time-energy uncertainty relation analogue to the position-momentum one,

operator. However Dirac's formulation of electron's relativistic quantum
mechanics (RQM) does allow the introduction of a dynamical time operator that
is self-adjoint. Consequently, it can be considered as the generator of a
unitary transformation of the system,as well as an additional system observable
subject to uncertainty. In the present paper these aspects are examined within
the standard framework of RQM.

the light curves of quasars, e.g. PG 1302-102 by Graham et al. (2015a). Any
quasar showing periodic oscillations in brightness would be a strong candidate
to be a close binary supermassive black hole and, in turn, a candidate for
gravitational wave studies. However, normal quasars -- powered by accretion
onto a single, supermassive black hole -- usually show stochastic variability
over a wide range of timescales. It is therefore important to carefully assess
the methods for identifying periodic candidates from among a population
dominated by stochastic variability. Using a Bayesian analysis of the light
curve of PG 1302-102, we find that a simple stochastic process is preferred
over a sinusoidal variations. We then discuss some of the problems one
encounters when searching for rare, strictly periodic signals among a large
number of irregularly sampled, stochastic time series, and use simulations of
quasar light curves to illustrate these points. From a few thousand simulations
of steep spectrum (`red noise') stochastic processes, we find many simulations
that display few-cycle periodicity like that seen in PG 1302-102. We emphasise
the importance of calibrating the false positive rate when the number of
targets in a search is very large.

which the presence of gender differences has not been extensively explored is
undergraduate laboratory courses. For example, one of the few laboratory
focused research-based assessments, the Colorado Learning Attitudes about
Science Survey for Experimental Physics (E-CLASS), has not been tested for the
existence of gender differences in students' responses. Here, we utilize a

significant gender differences. We also investigate how these differences vary
along multiple student and course demographic slices, including course level
(first-year vs.\ beyond-first-year) and major (physics vs.\ non-physics). We
observe a gender gap in pre- and postinstruction E-CLASS scores in the
aggregate data both for the overall score and for most items individually.
However, for some subpopulations (e.g., beyond-first-year students) the size or
even existence of the gender gap depends on another dimension (e.g., student
major). We also find that for all groups the gap in postinstruction scores
vanishes or is greatly reduced when controlling for preinstruction scores,

nonlinear differential equations, it has been suggested that the so-called
generalized Taylor series approach is equivalent to the homotopy analysis
method. In the present paper, we demonstrate that such a view is only valid in
very special cases, and in general the homotopy analysis method is far more
robust. In particular, the equivalence is only valid when the solution is
represented as a power series in the independent variable. As has been shown
many times, alternative basis functions can greatly improve the error
properties of homotopy solutions, and when the base functions are not
polynomials or power functions, we no longer have that the generalized Taylor
series approach is equivalent to the homotopy analysis method. We demonstrate
this by consideration of an example where the generalizes Taylor series must
always have a finite radius of convergence (and hence limited applicability),
while the homotopy solution is valid over the entire infinite domain. We then
give a second example for which the exact solution is not analytic, and hence
it will not agree with the generalized Taylor series over the domain. We
conclude that the generalized Taylor series approach is not equivalent to the
homotopy analysis method. In particular, the generalized Taylor series can at
best recover local information about solutions, whereas the homotopy analysis
method can recover the solutions globally if appropriate base functions are
selected. Such results have important implications for how series are
calculated when approximating solutions to nonlinear differential equations.

be constant which leads to a substantial simplification of the field equations.
We prove that a vacuum solution to quadratic gravity with traceless Ricci

non-Einstein solutions. Similarly, a vacuum solution to quadratic gravity with
traceless Ricci type III and aligned Weyl tensor of Petrov type II or more
special is again necessarily a Kundt spacetime.
  Then we study the general role of conformal transformations in constructing
vacuum solutions to quadratic gravity. We find that such solutions can be
obtained by solving one non-linear partial differential equation for a
conformal factor on any Einstein spacetime or, more generally, on any
background with vanishing Bach tensor. In particular, we show that all
geometries conformal to Kundt are either Kundt or Robinson-Trautman, and we

show that the observed accumulation is too fast for Ekman convergence to
explain it. We demonstrate that the accumulation is controlled by finite-size

ocean current and wind drags. We infer that the motion of flotsam in general is
constrained by similar effects. This is done by using a newly proposed

homomorphisms into a fixed image graph. Recently, there has been interest in
maximizing the number of homomorphisms from graphs with a fixed number of
vertices and edges into small image graphs. For the image graph
$H_{\text{ind}}$, the graph on two adjacent vertices, one of which is looped,
each homomorphism from $G$ to $H_{\text{ind}}$ corresponds to an independent
set in $G$. It follows from the Kruskal-Katona theorem that the number of
homomorphisms to $H_{\text{ind}}$ is maximized by the lex graph, whose edges
form an initial segment of the lex order.
  A \emph{loop-threshold graph} is a graph built recursively from a single
vertex, which may be looped or unlooped, by successively adding either a looped
dominating vertex or an unlooped isolated vertex at each stage. Thus, the graph
$H_{\text{ind}}$ is a loop-threshold graph. We survey known results for
maximizing the number of homomorphisms into small loop-threshold image graphs.
The only extremal homomorphism problem with a loop-threshold image graph on at
most three vertices not yet solved is $H_{\text{ind}}\cup E_1$, where extremal
graphs are the union of a lex graph and an empty graph. The only question that
remains is the size of the lex component of the extremal graph. While we cannot
give an exact answer for every number of vertices and edges, we establish the
significance of and give a bound for $\ell(m)$, the number of vertices in the
lex component of the extremal graph with $m$ edges and at least $m+1$ vertices.

singular perturbation theory how weak fluid inertia reduces the angular

of the spheroid (on its aspect ratio). In addition we determine the angular
velocity by direct numerical simulations. The results are in excellent
agreement with the theory at small but not too small values of the shear

a minimum separation it can resolve between two objects or sources; this limit
is typically defined by ""Rayleigh's criterion"", although in recent years there
have been a number of high-profile techniques demonstrating that Rayleigh's
limit can be surpassed under particular sets of conditions. Quantum information
and quantum metrology have given us new ways to approach measurement ; a new
proposal inspired by these ideas has now re-examined the problem of trying to
estimate the separation between two poorly resolved point sources. The ""Fisher
information"" provides the inverse of the Cramer-Rao bound, the lowest variance
achievable for an unbiased estimator. For a given imaging system and a fixed
number of collected photons, Tsang, Nair and Lu observed that the Fisher
information carried by the intensity of the light in the image-plane (the only
information available to traditional techniques, including previous
super-resolution approaches) falls to zero as the separation between the
sources decreases; this is known as ""Rayleigh's Curse."" On the other hand, when
they calculated the quantum Fisher information of the full electromagnetic
field (including amplitude and phase information), they found it remains
constant. In other words, there is infinitely more information available about
the separation of the sources in the phase of the field than in the intensity
alone. Here we implement a proof-of-principle system which makes use of the
phase information, and demonstrate a greatly improved ability to estimate the
distance between a pair of closely-separated sources, and immunity to
Rayleigh's curse.

subexponential in $\mathsf{OPT}$, unless the Exponential Time Hypothesis fails.
The assumption of the existence of two non-edges appears to be important: we
show that whenever $H$ is a complete graph without one edge, then $H$-Free Edge
Deletion is tightly connected to the Min Horn problem, whose approximability is
still open. Finally, in an attempt to extend our hardness results beyond
$3$-connected graphs, we consider the cases of $H$ being a path or a cycle, and
we achieve an almost complete dichotomy there.

the goal is to assess association between transcriptomic and metabolomic data

methods for identifying sparse structure in canonical correlation analysis
(CCA) with incorporation of biological/structural information. Our proposed
methods use prior network structural information among genes and among
metabolites to guide selection of relevant genes and metabolites in sparse CCA,
providing insight on the molecular underpinning of cardiovascular disease. Our
simulations demonstrate that the structured sparse CCA methods outperform
several existing sparse CCA methods in selecting relevant genes and metabolites
when structural information is informative and are robust to mis-specified
structural information. Our analysis of the PHI study reveals that a number of
genes and metabolic pathways including some known to be associated with
cardiovascular diseases are enriched in the subset of genes and metabolites
selected by our proposed approach.

explicit results on the asymptotics of DT invariants/Euler characteristics

landscape that lives in the back of a group leader's mind as he contemplates
strategic targeting. We assume that this representation is a combination of the
physical geography of the target environment, and the mental and physical cost
of following a seemingly random pattern of attacks. Focusing on the distance
and time between attacks and taking into consideration the transaction costs
that state boundaries impose, we wish to understand what constrains a group
leader to attack at a location other than the one that would seem to yield the
greatest overt payoff. By its very nature, the research problem defies the
collection of a full set of structural data. Instead, we leverage functional
data from the Armed Conflict Location and Event Data project (ACLED) dataset
that, inter alia, meticulously catalogues violent extremist incidents in North
and West Africa since 1997, to generate a network whose nodes are
administrative regions. These nodes are connected by edges of qualitatively
different types: undirected edges representing geographic distance, undirected
edges representing borders, and directed edges representing consecutive attacks
by the same group at the two endpoints. We analyze the resulting network using
novel spectral embedding techniques that are able to account fully for the
different types of edges. The result is a map of North and West Africa that
depicts the permeability to violence. A better understanding of how location,
time, and borders condition attacks enables planning, prepositioning, and
response.

both in term of memory, computation and performance. It is customary to
consider $\ell_1$ penalty to enforce sparsity in such scenarios. Sparsity
enforcing methods, the Lasso being a canonical example, are popular candidates
to address high dimension. For efficiency, they rely on tuning a parameter
trading data fitting versus sparsity. For the Lasso theory to hold this tuning
parameter should be proportional to the noise level, yet the latter is often
unknown in practice. A possible remedy is to jointly optimize over the
regression parameter as well as over the noise level. This has been considered
under several names in the literature: Scaled-Lasso, Square-root Lasso,
Concomitant Lasso estimation for instance, and could be of interest for
confidence sets or uncertainty quantification. In this work, after illustrating
numerical difficulties for the Smoothed Concomitant Lasso formulation, we
propose a modification we coined Smoothed Concomitant Lasso, aimed at
increasing numerical stability. We propose an efficient and accurate solver
leading to a computational cost no more expansive than the one for the Lasso.

are estimated, and corrected for extinction and line contamination in the
filter pass-bands. The star formation rates (SFRs) are estimated using Halpha
images and from the archival data in the far-ultraviolet (FUV), far-infrared
(FIR) and 1.4 GHz radio continuum wave-bands. A comparison of SFRs estimated
from different wavebands is made after including similar data available in
literature for other WR galaxies. The Halpha based SFRs are found to be tightly
correlated with SFRs estimated from the FUV data. The correlations also exist
with SFRs estimates based on the radio and FIR data. The WR galaxies also
follow the radio-FIR correlation known for normal star forming galaxies,
although it is seen here that majority of dwarf WR galaxies have radio
deficiency. An analysis using ratio of non-thermal to thermal radio continuum
and ratio of FUV to Halpha SFR indicates that WR galaxies have lesser
non-thermal radio emission compared to normal galaxies, most likely due to lack
of supernova from the very young star formation episode in the WR galaxies. The
morphologies of 16 galaxies in our sample are highly suggestive of an ongoing
tidal interaction or a past merger in these galaxies. This survey strengthens
the conclusions obtained from previous similar studies indicating the

change in the oscillation mode frequencies. We also fit the differences using
several parametric models currently available in the literature. The surface
effect in the stars of solar-type and later is qualitatively similar and
changes steadily with decreasing effective temperature. In particular, the
point of greatest frequency difference decreases slightly as a fraction of the
acoustic cut-off frequency and the overall scale of the surface effect
decreases. The surface effect in the hot, F3-type star follows the same trend
in scale (i.e. it is larger in magnitude) but shows a different overall
variation with mode frequency. We find that the two-term fit by Ball & Gizon
(2014) is best able to reproduce the surface terms across all four spectral
types, although the scaled solar term and a modified Lorentzian function also
match the three cooler simulations reasonably well. ... Our simplified results
suggest that the surface effect is generally larger in hotter stars (and
correspondingly smaller in cooler stars) and of similar shape in stars of solar
type and cooler. However, we cannot presently predict whether this will remain
so when other components of the surface effect are included.

scattering optical depth, and of the discovery of a faint AGN population at $z
> 4$, we reassess the actual contribution of quasars to cosmic reionization. To
this aim, we extend our previous MCMC-based data-constrained semi-analytic
reionization model and study the role of quasars on global reionization
history. We find that, the quasars can alone reionize the Universe only for
models with very high AGN emissivities at high redshift. These models are still
allowed by the recent CMB data and most of the observations related to HI
reionization. However, they predict an extended and early HeII reionization
ending at $z\gtrsim4$ and a much slower evolution in the mean HeII Ly-$\alpha$
forest opacity than what the actual observation suggests. Thus when we further
constrain our model against the HeII Ly-$\alpha$ forest data, this
AGN-dominated scenario is found to be clearly ruled out at 2-$\sigma$ limits.
The data seems to favour a standard two-component picture where quasar
contributions become negligible at $z\gtrsim6$ and a non-zero escape fraction
of $\sim10\%$ is needed from early-epoch galaxies. For such models, mean
neutral hydrogen fraction decreases to $\sim10^{-4}$ at $z=6.2$ from $\sim0.8$
at $z=10.0$ and helium becomes doubly ionized at much later time, $z\sim3$. We
find that, these models are as well in good agreement with the observed thermal
evolution of IGM as opposed to models with very high AGN emissivities.

between quasars and their host galaxies and measuring cosmic black hole-growth.
At high redshift, z > 2.1, black hole masses are normally derived using the
velocity-width of the CIV broad emission line, based on the assumption that the
observed velocity-widths arise from virial-induced motions. In many quasars,
the CIV-emission line exhibits significant blue asymmetries (`blueshifts') with
the line centroid displaced by up to thousands of km/s to the blue. These
blueshifts almost certainly signal the presence of strong outflows, most likely
originating in a disc wind. We have obtained near-infrared spectra, including
the H$\alpha$ emission line, for 19 luminous ($L_{Bol}$ = 46.5-47.5 erg/s)
Sloan Digital Sky Survey quasars, at redshifts 2 < z < 2.7, with CIV emission
lines spanning the full-range of blueshifts present in the population. A strong
correlation between CIV-velocity width and blueshift is found and, at large
blueshifts, > 2000 km/s, the velocity-widths appear to be dominated by
non-virial motions. Black-hole masses, based on the full width at half maximum
of the CIV-emission line, can be overestimated by a factor of five at large
blueshifts. A larger sample of quasar spectra with both CIV and H$\beta$, or
H$\alpha$, emission lines will allow quantitative corrections to CIV-based
black-hole masses as a function of blueshift to be derived. We find that
quasars with large CIV blueshifts possess high Eddington luminosity ratios and
that the fraction of high-blueshift quasars in a flux-limited sample is
enhanced by a factor of approximately four relative to a sample limited by
black hole mass.

to supermassive black holes using a Bondi-Hoyle-like prescription. Doing so
ignores the effects of the angular momentum of the gas, which may prevent or
significantly delay accreting material falling directly on to the black hole.
We outline a black hole accretion rate prescription using a modified
Bondi-Hoyle formulation that takes into account the angular momentum of the
surrounding gas. Meaningful implementation of this modified Bondi-Hoyle
formulation is only possible when the inner vorticity distribution is well
resolved, which we achieve through the use of a super-Lagrangian refinement
technique around black holes within our simulations. We then investigate the
effects on black hole growth by performing simulations of isolated as well as

angular momentum barrier can play an important role in limiting the growth of
black holes, leading also to a several Gyr delay between the starburst and the
quasar phase in major merger remnants. We stress, however, that the magnitude
of this effect is highly sensitive to the thermodynamical state of the
accreting gas and to the nature of the black hole feedback present.

miniaturize near-infrared (NIR) spectrometers for upcoming large telescopes and

bands), free spectral range of about 30 nm, high on-chip throughput of about
80% (-1dB) and low crosstalk (high contrast ratio) between adjacent on-chip
wavelength channels of less than 1% (-20dB). A promising photonic technology to
achieve these requirements is Arrayed Waveguide Gratings (AWGs). We have
developed our first generation of AWG devices using a silica-on-silicon
substrate with a very thin layer of silicon-nitride in the core of our
waveguides. The waveguide bending losses are minimized by optimizing the
geometry of the waveguides. Our first generation of AWG devices are designed
for H band and have a resolving power of around 1500 and free spectral range of
about 10 nm around a central wavelength of 1600 nm. The devices have a
footprint of only 12 mm x 6 mm. They are broadband (1450-1650 nm), have a peak
on-chip throughput of about 80% (-1 dB) and contrast ratio of about 1.5% (-18
dB). These results confirm the robustness of our design, fabrication and
simulation methods. Currently, the devices are designed for Transverse Electric
(TE) polarization and all the results are for TE mode. We are developing
separate J- and H-band AWGs with higher resolving power, higher throughput and
lower crosstalk over a wider free spectral range to make them better suited for
astronomical applications.

complexes. Desmosomes are membrane-associated adhesion complexes that
mechanically tether the cytoskeletal intermediate filaments (IFs) between two
adjacent cells, creating a network of tough connections in tissues such as skin
and heart. Desmoplakin (DP) is the key desmosomal protein that binds IFs, and
the DP-IF association poses a quandary: desmoplakin must stably and tightly
bind IFs to maintain the structural integrity of the desmosome. Yet, newly
synthesized DP must traffick along the cytoskeleton to the site of nascent
desmosome assembly without 'sticking' to the IF network, implying weak or
transient DP--IF contacts. Recent work reveals that these contacts are
modulated by post-translational modifications (PTMs) in DP's C-terminal tail.
Using molecular dynamics simulations, we have elucidated the structural basis
of these PTM-induced effects. Our simulations, nearing 2 microseconds in
aggregate, indicate that phosphorylation of S2849 induces an 'arginine claw' in
desmoplakin's C-terminal tail (DPCTT). If a key arginine, R2834, is methylated,
the DPCTT preferentially samples conformations that are geometrically
well-suited as substrates for processive phosphorylation by the cognate kinase
GSK3. We suggest that DPCTT is a molecular switch that modulates, via its
conformational dynamics, DP's efficacy as a substrate for GSK3. Finally, we
show that the fluctuating DPCTT can contact other parts of DP, suggesting a
competitive binding mechanism for the modulation of DP--IF interactions.

SWIFT was designed from the bottom up to provide excellent strong scaling on
both commodity clusters (Tier-2 systems) and Top100-supercomputers (Tier-0
systems), without relying on architecture-specific features or specialized
accelerator hardware. This performance is due to three main computational
approaches: (1) Task-based parallelism for shared-memory parallelism, which
provides fine-grained load balancing and thus strong scaling on large numbers
of cores. (2) Graph-based domain decomposition, which uses the task graph to
decompose the simulation domain such that the work, as opposed to just the
data, as is the case with most partitioning schemes, is equally distributed
across all nodes. (3) Fully dynamic and asynchronous communication, in which
communication is modelled as just another task in the task-based scheme,
sending data whenever it is ready and deferring on tasks that rely on data from
other nodes until it arrives. In order to use these approaches, the code had to
be re-written from scratch, and the algorithms therein adapted to the
task-based paradigm. As a result, we can show upwards of 60% parallel
efficiency for moderate-sized problems when increasing the number of cores
512-fold, on both x86-based and Power8-based architectures.

dominates the central part of the merger remnant and the less massive

V5852~Sgr (discovered as OGLE-2015-NOVA-01), which exhibits a combination of
features from different nova classes. The photometry shows a flat-topped light
curve with quasi-periodic oscillations, then a smooth decline followed by two
fainter recoveries in brightness. Spectroscopy with the Southern African Large
Telescope shows first a classical nova with an Fe II or Fe IIb spectral type.
In the later spectrum, broad emissions from helium, nitrogen and oxygen are
prominent and the iron has faded which could be an indication to the start of
the nebular phase. The line widths suggest ejection velocities around
$1000\,{\rm km\,s^{-1}}$. The nova is in the direction of the Galactic bulge
and is heavily reddened by an uncertain amount. The $V$ magnitude 16 days after
maximum enables a distance to be estimated and this suggests that the nova may
be in the extreme trailing stream of the Sagittarius dwarf spheroidal galaxy.
If so it is the first nova to be detected from that, or from any dwarf
spheroidal galaxy. Given the uncertainty of the method and the unusual light
curve we cannot rule out the possibility that it is in the bulge or even the
Galactic disk behind the bulge.

employing multiple kernels - more than one kernel functions for a set of the

resolved and shows no evidence, to within the uncertainties, of dust density
enhancements. Additional features of the 1.1 mm map are: (i) the presence of
significant flux in the gap between the ring and the star, probably providing

attached to planar dark solitons in scalar Bose-Einstein condensates.
Dynamically stable states of this type are found at low values of the chemical
potential in channeled condensates, where the long-wavelength instability of
dark solitons is prevented. In oblate, harmonic traps, U-shaped vortex lines
attached by both ends to a single planar soliton are shown to be long-lived
states. Our results are reported for parameters typical of current experiments,
and open up a way to explore the interplay of different topological structures.
These configurations provide Dirichlet boundary conditions for vortex lines and
thereby mimic open strings attached to D-branes in string theory. We show that
these similarities can be formally established by mapping the Gross-Pitaevskii
theory into a dual effective string theory for open strings via a boson-vortex
duality in 3+1 dimensions. Combining a one-form gauge field living on the
soliton plane which couples to the endpoints of vortex lines and a two-form
gauge field which couples to vortex lines, we obtain a gauge-invariant dual
action of open vortex lines with their endpoints attached to dark solitons.

species. We introduce a model with the diffusion-type term $\nabla \cdot \left[
a \nabla \left( u/P \right) \right]$ which includes some previously studied
systems as special cases, where a positive space-dependent function $P$ can be
interpreted as a chosen dispersal strategy. The well-known result that if the
first species chooses $P$ proportional to the carrying capacity while the
second does not then the first species will bring the second one to extinction,
is also valid for this type of dispersal. However, we focus on the case when
the ideal free distribution is attained as a combination of the two strategies
adopted by the two species. Then there is a globally stable coexistence
equilibrium, its uniqueness is justified. If both species choose the same
dispersal strategy, non-proportional to the carrying capacity, then the
influence of higher diffusion rates is negative, while of higher intrinsic
growth rates is positive for survival in a competition. This extends the result
of [J. Math. Biol. {\bf 37} (1) (1998), 61--83] for the regular diffusion to a
more general type of dispersal.

  Hole","With a simple correction to the effective potential. Will not submit

marginally stable circular orbit (or the innermost stable circular orbit, ISCO)
around the black hole. It is important for the theories of black hole accretion
disks and their applications to astrophysical black hole systems.
Traditionally, the marginally stable circular orbit is obtained by considering
the equatorial motion of a test particle around a black hole. However, in
reality the accretion flow around black holes consists of fluid, in which the
pressure often plays an important role. Here we consider the influence of fluid
pressure on the location of marginally stable circular orbit around black
holes. It is found that when the temperature of the fluid is so low that the
thermal energy of a particle is much smaller than its rest energy, the location
of marginally stable circular orbit is almost the same as that in the test
particle case. However, we demonstrate that in some special cases the
marginally stable circular orbit can be different when the fluid pressure is
large and the thermal energy becomes non-negligible comparing with the rest
energy. We present our results for both the cases of non-spinning and spinning
black holes. The influences of our results on the black hole spin parameter
measurement in X-ray binaries and the energy release efficiency of accretion
flows around black holes are discussed.

fundamental importance to food security. This is especially true in poor
countries, where basic needs are frequently threatened by economic,
environmental, and health shocks. An empirically sound formalization of the
concept of food security resilience, however, is lacking. Here we introduce a
general framework for quantifying resilience based on a simple definition: a
unit is resilient if $(a)$ its long-term food security trend is not
deteriorating and $(b)$ the effects of shocks on this trend do not persist over
time. Our approach can be applied to any food security variable for which
high-frequency time-series data is available, can accommodate any unit of
analysis (e.g., individuals, households, countries), and is especially useful
in rapidly changing contexts wherein standard equilibrium-based economic models
are ineffective. We illustrate our method with an analysis of per capita
kilocalorie availability for 161 countries between 1961 and 2011. We find that
resilient countries are not necessarily those that are characterized by high
levels or less volatile fluctuations of kilocalorie intake. Accordingly, food
security policies and programs will need to be tailored not only to welfare
levels at any one time, but also to long-run welfare dynamics.

comparators that output the larger of their two inputs if the inputs are more
than a given threshold apart, and output an adversarially-chosen input
otherwise. We consider two adversarial models. A non-adaptive adversary that
decides on the outcomes in advance based solely on the inputs, and an adaptive
adversary that can decide on the outcome of each query depending on previous
queries and outcomes.
  Against the non-adaptive adversary, we derive a maximum-selection algorithm
that uses at most $2n$ comparisons in expectation, and a sorting algorithm that
uses at most $2n \ln n$ comparisons in expectation. These numbers are within
small constant factors from the best possible. Against the adaptive adversary,
we propose a maximum-selection algorithm that uses $\Theta(n\log
(1/{\epsilon}))$ comparisons to output a correct answer with probability at
least $1-\epsilon$. The existence of this algorithm affirmatively resolves an
open problem of Ajtai, Feldman, Hassadim, and Nelson.
  Our study was motivated by a density-estimation problem where, given samples
from an unknown underlying distribution, we would like to find a distribution
in a known class of $n$ candidate distributions that is close to underlying
distribution in $\ell_1$ distance. Scheffe's algorithm outputs a distribution
at an $\ell_1$ distance at most 9 times the minimum and runs in time
$\Theta(n^2\log n)$. Using maximum selection, we propose an algorithm with the
same approximation guarantee but run time of $\Theta(n\log n)$.

of co-expression in gene expression data. Co-regulation, and involvement of
genes in similar cellular function, is subsequently inferred from the clusters
which are obtained. Increasingly sophisticated algorithms have been applied to
microarray data, however, less attention has been given to the statistical
significance of the results of clustering studies. We present a technique for
the analysis of commonly used hierarchical linkage-based clustering called
Significance Analysis of Linkage Trees (SALT).
  Results: The statistical significance of pairwise similarity levels between
gene expression profiles, a measure of co-expression, is established using a
surrogate data analysis method. We find that a modified version of the standard
linkage technique, complete-linkage, must be used to generate hierarchical
linkage trees with the appropriate properties. The approach is illustrated
using synthetic data generated from a novel model of gene expression profiles
and is then applied to previously analysed microarray data on the
transcriptional response of human fibroblasts to serum stimulation.

  Workshop",,,,"cs.HC cs.AI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  An important application of interactive machine learning is extending or
amplifying the cognitive and physical capabilities of a human. To accomplish
this, machines need to learn about their human users' intentions and adapt to
their preferences. In most current research, a user has conveyed preferences to
a machine using explicit corrective or instructive feedback; explicit feedback
imposes a cognitive load on the user and is expensive in terms of human effort.
The primary objective of the current work is to demonstrate that a learning
agent can reduce the amount of explicit feedback required for adapting to the
user's preferences pertaining to a task by learning to perceive a value of its
behavior from the human user, particularly from the user's facial
expressions---we call this face valuing. We empirically evaluate face valuing
on a grip selection task. Our preliminary results suggest that an agent can
quickly adapt to a user's changing preferences with minimal explicit feedback
by learning a value function that maps facial features extracted from a camera
image to expected future reward. We believe that an agent learning to perceive
a value from the body language of its human user is complementary to existing
interactive machine learning approaches and will help in creating successful
human-machine interactive applications.

questions of planetary science. Key challenges remain, but a new wave of
orbital and in situ observations and improvements in climate modeling have led
to significant advances over the last decade. Multiple lines of geologic
evidence now point to an episodically warm surface during the late Noachian and
early Hesperian periods 3-4 Ga. The low solar flux received by Mars in its
first billion years and inefficiency of plausible greenhouse gases such as CO2
means that the steady-state early Martian climate was likely cold. A denser CO2
atmosphere would have caused adiabatic cooling of the surface and hence
migration of water ice to the higher altitude equatorial and southern regions
of the planet. Transient warming caused melting of snow and ice deposits and a
temporarily active hydrological cycle, leading to erosion of the valley
networks and other fluvial features. Precise details of the warming mechanisms
remain unclear, but impacts, volcanism and orbital forcing all likely played an
important role. The lack of evidence for glaciation across much of Mars'
ancient terrain suggests the late Noachian surface water inventory was not
sufficient to sustain a northern ocean. While mainly inhospitable on the
surface, early Mars may nonetheless have presented significant opportunities
for the development of microbial life.

measure, which has been used in many previous works, analyzes global shifts in
a word's distributional semantics, it is sensitive to changes due to regular
processes of linguistic drift, such as the semantic generalization of promise
(""I promise."" -> ""It promised to be exciting.""). The second measure, which we
develop here, focuses on local changes to a word's nearest semantic neighbors;
it is more sensitive to cultural shifts, such as the change in the meaning of
cell (""prison cell"" -> ""cell phone""). Comparing measurements made by these two
methods allows researchers to determine whether changes are more cultural or
linguistic in nature, a distinction that is essential for work in the digital
humanities and historical linguistics.

based on radio observations with ALMA toward a high-mass young stellar object
(YSO) in a nearby low metallicity galaxy, the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC).
Molecular emission lines of CO, C17O, HCO+, H13CO+, H2CO, NO, SiO, H2CS, 33SO,
32SO2, 34SO2, and 33SO2 are detected from a compact region (0.1 pc) associated
with a high-mass YSO, ST11. The temperature of molecular gas is estimated to be
higher than 100 K based on rotation diagram analysis of SO2 and 34SO2 lines.
The compact source size, warm gas temperature, high density, and rich molecular
lines around a high-mass protostar suggest that ST11 is associated with a hot
molecular core. We find that the molecular abundances of the LMC hot core are
significantly different from those of Galactic hot cores. The abundances of
CH3OH, H2CO, and HNCO are remarkably lower compared with Galactic hot cores by
at least 1-3 orders of magnitude. We suggest that these abundances are
characterized by the deficiency of molecules whose formation requires the
hydrogenation of CO on grain surfaces. In contrast, NO shows a high abundance
in ST11 despite the notably low abundance of nitrogen in the LMC. A multitude
of SO2 and its isotopologue line detections in ST11 imply that SO2 can be a key
molecular tracer of hot core chemistry in metal-poor environments. Furthermore,
we find molecular outflows around the hot core, which is the second detection
of an extragalactic protostellar outflow. In this paper, we discuss physical
and chemical characteristics of a hot molecular core in the low metallicity
environment.

nontrivial. The spinfoams in low and high curvature regions of the space-time
may be viewed as in two different {phases} of covariant LQG. There should be a
phase transition as the space-time described by spinfoam becomes more and more

the authors have proposed to adopt the Ginibre point process---one of the

with the presence of an H-poor gas whose origin may be linked to the binarity

an $L^p$-boundedness result for $L^2$-orthogonal projectors on polynomial
subspaces. The $W^{s,p}$-approximation results have general applicability to

this paper, we investigate the convergency of standard N-body simulations,
especially in the cusp region, following the approach proposed by
\protect{\citep{13}}. We simulate the well known Hernquist model using the SPH
code Gadget-3 and consider the full array of dynamical parameters of the
particles. We find that, although the cuspy profile is stable, all integrals of
motion characterizing individual particles suffer strong unphysical variations
along the whole halo, revealing an effective interaction between the test
bodies. This result casts doubts on the reliability of the velocity
distribution function obtained in the simulations. Moreover, we find unphysical
Fokker-Planck streams of particles in the cusp region. The same streams should
appear in cosmological N-body simulations, being strong enough to change the
shape of the cusp or even to create it. Our analysis, based on the Hernquist
model and the standard SPH code, strongly suggests that the UDPs generally
found by the cosmological N-body simulations may be a consequence of numerical
effects. A much better understanding of the N-body simulation convergency is
necessary before a 'core-cusp problem' can properly be used to question the

The proposed framework shares similarities with compressive sensing, which aims
at drastically reducing the dimension of high-dimensional signals while
preserving the ability to reconstruct them. To perform the estimation task, we
derive an iterative algorithm analogous to sparse reconstruction algorithms in
the context of linear inverse problems. We exemplify our framework with the
compressive estimation of a Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM), providing heuristics
on the choice of the sketching procedure and theoretical guarantees of
reconstruction. We experimentally show on synthetic data that the proposed
algorithm yields results comparable to the classical Expectation-Maximization
(EM) technique while requiring significantly less memory and fewer computations
when the number of database elements is large. We further demonstrate the
potential of the approach on real large-scale data (over 10 8 training samples)
for the task of model-based speaker verification. Finally, we draw some
connections between the proposed framework and approximate Hilbert space
embedding of probability distributions using random features. We show that the
proposed sketching operator can be seen as an innovative method to design
translation-invariant kernels adapted to the analysis of GMMs. We also use this
theoretical framework to derive information preservation guarantees, in the
spirit of infinite-dimensional compressive sensing.

only recently been applied to time-series neuroimaging data such as MEG and EEG
to address experimental questions in Cognitive Neuroscience. In a
tutorial-style review, we describe a broad set of options to inform future
time-series decoding studies from a Cognitive Neuroscience perspective. Using
example MEG data, we illustrate the effects that different options in the
decoding analysis pipeline can have on experimental results where the aim is to
'decode' different perceptual stimuli or cognitive states over time from
dynamic brain activation patterns. We show that decisions made at both
preprocessing (e.g., dimensionality reduction, subsampling, trial averaging)
and decoding (e.g., classifier selection, cross-validation design) stages of
the analysis can significantly affect the results. In addition to standard
decoding, we describe extensions to MVPA for time-varying neuroimaging data
including representational similarity analysis, temporal generalisation, and
the interpretation of classifier weight maps. Finally, we outline important
caveats in the design and interpretation of time-series decoding experiments.

ionic solids. In context of amorphous InGaZn oxide (a-IGZO), even though the
coordination polyhedra are irregularly arranged, it will be beneficial to
identify them. In this work, we address the questions, (a) is it possible to
classify all the polyhedra that occur in a-IGZO into only a few distinct
groups? and (b) are these the same polyhedral motifs as those observed in the
crystalline indium gallium zinc oxide (c-IGZO) or other related crystalline
oxides of indium, gallium and zinc? Therefore, in this first principles based
study, a large number (ten) of equivalent samples of a-IGZO were prepared by ab
initio melt-and-quench molecular dynamics, so that several distinct samples of
the amorphous landscape are obtained. The combination of all these structures
thus obtained is a better representation of a real a-IGZO sample. For the ten
samples containing 360 cations, we propose a simpler and more accurate method
for determining the coordination number of each polyhedron, which was verified
by charge density plots. Based on a method of comparing bond angles between
metal and oxygen atoms, the identified polyhedra were matched to the polyhedral
motifs present in the related crystalline systems, such as, InGaZnO4, In2O3,
Ga2O3 and ZnO. We find, the a-IGZO primarily consists of the following
polyhedra: a tetrahedron from space group 199 and an octahedron from space
group 206 of In2O3; a tetrahedron from space group 12 and an octahedron from
space group 167 of Ga2O3; a tetrahedron from space group 186 of ZnO; zinc and
gallium trigonal bipyramids from c-IGZO; and one zinc 4-fold, one zinc 5-fold
and one indium 5-fold coordination polyhedra that occur only in the amorphous
phase. We are able to reduce the description of structure from 360 to 10 groups
of polyhedra. The benefits of this identification could be enormous.

actual structure of the likelihood function - and it is not predicated on the
Laplace approximation which is implicitly built in least-square fits that can
potentially bias the inference - (ii) it provides the ratio of the evidences of
any two models under consideration as the statistical quantity to compare

monitoring of multiple systems, that can be expressed in terms of ratio of
evidences or probability intervals of global (thus not system-dependent)

heterogeneous OpenPower platform using our fast porting interface cupla, which

limited battery capacity, and may terminate the D2D connection when its battery

offloading gain of the system and energy cost of each helper user. To this end,
we introduce a user-centric protocol to control the energy cost for a helper

thermal finite energy QCD sum rules for the pseudoscalar-current correlator.
This quark-mass remains mostly constant for temperatures well below the
critical temperature for deconfinement/chiral-symmetry restoration. As this
critical temperature is approached, the quark-mass increases sharply with
increasing temperature. This increase is far more pronounced if the temperature
dependence of the pion mass (determined independently from other methods) is
taken into account. The behavior of $f_\pi(T)$ is consistent with the
expectation from chiral symmetry, i.e. that it should follow the thermal

field due to the significant performance improvement they have provided on the
challenging wild datasets. These approaches have been extensively tested on
such unconstrained datasets, on the Labeled Faces in the Wild and YouTube
Faces, to name a few. However, their capability to handle individual appearance
variations caused by factors such as head pose, illumination, occlusion, and
misalignment has not been thoroughly assessed till now. In this paper, we
present a comprehensive study to evaluate the performance of deep learning
based face representation under several conditions including the varying head
pose angles, upper and lower face occlusion, changing illumination of different
strengths, and misalignment due to erroneous facial feature localization. Two
successful and publicly available deep learning models, namely VGG-Face and
Lightened CNN have been utilized to extract face representations. The obtained
results show that although deep learning provides a powerful representation for
face recognition, it can still benefit from preprocessing, for example, for
pose and illumination normalization in order to achieve better performance
under various conditions. Particularly, if these variations are not included in
the dataset used to train the deep learning model, the role of preprocessing
becomes more crucial. Experimental results also show that deep learning based
representation is robust to misalignment and can tolerate facial feature
localization errors up to 10% of the interocular distance.

spin-1 ultracold Bose gas via mean field approach corresponding to the both
signs of the spin dependent interaction. In contrast to some of the earlier
studies, the magnetic field in our work is included through both the hopping
frequencies (via Peierls coupling) and the zeeman interaction, thereby
facilitating an explo- ration for competition between the two. The phase
diagrams in the antiferromagnetic case shows that the Mott insulating (MI)
phase with even particle occupancies is stable at low magnetic fields. At
higher magnetic fields, due to a competition between the hopping and the zeeman
interaction terms, the latter tries to destabilize the MI phase by suppressing
the formation of singlet pairs, while the former tends to stabilize the MI
phase. In the ferromagnetic case, the MI lobes become more stable with
increasing flux strengths. Further inclusion of a three body interaction
potential in order to ascertain its role on the phase diagram, we found that in
absence of the magnetic field, the MI lobes become more stable compared to the
superfluid (SF) phase and the location of the transition point for the MI-SF
phase increases with increasing the three body interaction strength. A strong
coupling perturbative calculation has also been done to provide a comparison
with our mean field phase diagrams. Lastly, with inclusion of the external
field, the insulating phases are found to be further stabilized by the three
body interaction potential.

spatial interpolation, the computational cost of this embedding is independent
of the number of parameters in the system, making the approach ideally suited
to high-dimensional problems. We describe in detail the application of this

monolithic systems. Thus, code generation is often tied to a fixed set of
features, hardly reusable in different contexts, and without means for
configuration of variants. In this paper,we present an approach for developing
product lines of template-based code generators. This approach applies concepts
from feature-oriented programming to make variability explicit and manageable.
Moreover, it relies on explicit variability regions (VR) in a code generators
templates, refinements of VRs, and the aggregation of templates and refinements
into reusable layers. Aconcrete product is defined by selecting one or multiple
layers. If necessary, additional layers required due to VR refinements are
automatically selected.

monolayer pristine transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs). Here we show that
point defects, which are omnipresent in the TMD membranes, exhibit even
stronger SOC effects and change the physics of the host materials drastically.
In this Article we chose the representative monolayer WS\sub{2} slabs from the
TMD family together with seven typical types of point defects including
monovacancies, interstitials, and antisites. We calculated the formation
energies of these defects, and studied the effect of spin-orbit coupling (SOC)
on the corresponding defect states. We found that the S monovacancy (V\sub{S} )
and S interstitial (adatom) have the lowest formation energies. In the case of
V\sub{S} and both of the W\sub{S and W\sub{S2} antisites, the defect states
exhibit giant splitting up to 296 meV when SOC is considered. Depending on the
relative position of the defect state with respect to the conduction band
minimum (CBM), the hybrid functional HSE will either increase the splitting by
up to 60 meV (far from CBM), or decrease the splitting by up to 57 meV (close
to CBM). Furthermore, we found that both the W\sub{S} and W\sub{S2} antisites
possess a magnetic moment of 2 $\mu_{B}$ localized at the antisite W atom and
the neighboring W atoms. All these findings provide new insights in the defect
behavior under SOC point to new possibilities for spintronics applications for
TMDs.

Different
from estimating the real age of individuals, in which each face image has a

grouped the face images that are within a specified age range. Using these age
groups and their age-shifted groupings, we have trained an ensemble of deep

by recombination. Numerous weak optical recombination lines (ORLs) of O II, C
II, N II and Ne II were detected in the spectra and accurate fluxes measured.
Line flux tables were compiled and ready for use by the community of nebular
astrophysics. These ORLs were critically analyzed using the effective
recombination coefficients recently calculated for the optical recombination

nebulae. Plasma diagnostics based on the heavy element ORLs were carried out

Resnick (2007) to describe the asymptotic behavior of a random vector as one
specific component becomes extreme. Obviously, this class of models is related
to classical multivariate extreme value theory which describes the behavior of
a random vector as its norm (and therefore at least one of its components)
becomes extreme. However, it turns out that this relationship is rather subtle
and sometimes contrary to intuition. We clarify the differences between the two
approaches with the help of several illuminative (counter)examples.
Furthermore, we discuss marginal standardization, which is a useful tool in
classical multivariate extreme value theory but, as we point out, much less
straightforward and sometimes even obscuring in conditional extreme value
models. Finally, we indicate how, in some situations, a more comprehensive
characterization of the asymptotic behavior can be obtained if the conditions
of conditional extreme value models are relaxed so that the limit is no longer
unique.

capability and high angular resolution. Primary mirror segmentation is a key
technological solution for large-aperture telescopes because it opens the path
toward significantly increasing the angular resolution. The segments are kept
aligned by an active optics system that must reduce segment misalignments below
tens of nm RMS to achieve the high optical quality required for astronomical
science programs. The development of cophasing techniques is mandatory for the
next generation of space- and ground-based segmented telescopes, which both
share the need for increasing spatial resolution. We propose a new focal plane
cophasing sensor that exploits the scientific image of a coronagraphic
instrument to retrieve simultaneously piston and tip-tilt misalignments. The
self-coherent camera phasing sensor (SCC-PS) adequately combines the SCC
properties to segmented telescope architectures with adapted segment
misalignment estimators and image processing. An overview of the system
architecture, and a thorough performance and sensitivity analysis, including a
closed-loop efficiency, are presented by means of numerical simulations. The
SCC-PS estimates simultaneously piston and tip-tilt misalignments and corrects
them in closed-loop operation. The SCC-PS does not require any a priori on the
signal at the segment boundaries or any dedicated optical path. It has a
moderate sensitivity to misalignments, virtually none to pupil shear, and is
insensitive to segment gaps and edge effects. Primary mirror phasing can be
achieved with bright natural guide star. The SCC-PS is a noninvasive concept
and an efficient phasing sensor from the image domain. It is an attractive
candidate for segment cophasing at the instrument level or alternatively at the
telescope level, as usually envisioned in current space- and ground-based
observatories.

characterized by moment restrictions by casting the problem within the
Exponentially Tilted Empirical Likelihood (ETEL) framework. Because the ETEL
function has a well defined probabilistic interpretation and plays the role of
a nonparametric likelihood, a fully Bayesian semiparametric framework can be
developed. We establish a number of powerful results surrounding the Bayesian
ETEL framework in such models. One major concern driving our work is the
possibility of misspecification. To accommodate this possibility, we show how
the moment conditions can be reexpressed in terms of additional nuisance
parameters and that, even under misspecification, the Bayesian ETEL posterior
distribution satisfies a Bernstein-von Mises result. A second key contribution
of the paper is the development of a framework based on marginal likelihoods
and Bayes factors to compare models defined by different moment conditions.
Computation of the marginal likelihoods is by the method of Chib (1995) as
extended to Metropolis-Hastings samplers in Chib and Jeliazkov (2001). We
establish the model selection consistency of the marginal likelihood and show
that the marginal likelihood favors the model with the minimum number of
parameters and the maximum number of valid moment restrictions. When the models
are misspecified, the marginal likelihood model selection procedure selects the
model that is closer to the (unknown) true data generating process in terms of
the Kullback-Leibler divergence. The ideas and results in this paper provide a
further broadening of the theoretical underpinning and value of the Bayesian
ETEL framework with likely far-reaching practical consequences. The discussion
is illuminated through several examples.

fibres is a linear function of their Young's moduli and, hence, the
corresponding value of the shift of the 2D Raman peak over axial stress is, in
fact, a constant. By moving across the length scales we show that this value is
also valid at the nanoscale as it corresponds to the in plane breathing mode of
graphene that is present in both PAN based fibres and monolayer graphene.
Hence, the values of the shift of the 2D Raman peak can be easily converted to
values of stress in the linear elastic region without the aid of modelling or
the need to resort to cumbersome experimental procedures for obtaining the
axial force transmitted to the material and the cross sectional area of the two

proposed to be the candidate central engine of at least some short gamma-ray
bursts (SGRBs), based on the ""internal plateau"" commonly observed in the early
X-ray afterglow. While a previous analysis shows a qualitative consistency
between this suggestion and the Swift SGRB data, the distribution of observed
break time $t_b$ is much narrower than the distribution of the collapse time of
supramassive NSs for the several NS equations-of-state (EoSs) investigated. In
this paper, we study four recently-constructed ""unified"" NS EoSs, as well as
three developed strange quark star (QS) EoSs within the new confinement
density-dependent mass model. All the EoSs chosen here satisfy the recent
observational constraints of the two massive pulsars whose masses are precisely
measured. We construct sequences of rigidly rotating NS/QS configurations with
increasing spinning frequency $f$, from non-rotating ($f = 0$) to the Keplerian
frequency ($f = f_{\rm K}$), and provide convenient analytical parametrizations
of the results. Assuming that the cosmological NS-NS merger systems have the
same mass distribution as the Galactic NS-NS systems, we demonstrate that all
except the BCPM NS EoS can reproduce the current $22\%$ supramassive NS/QS
fraction constraint as derived from the SGRB data. We simultaneously simulate
the observed quantities (the break time $t_b$, the break time luminosity $L_b$
and the total energy in the electromagnetic channel $E_{\rm total}$) of SGRBs,
and find that while equally well reproducing other observational constraints,
QS EoSs predict a much narrower $t_b$ distribution than that of the NS EoSs,
better matching the data. We therefore suggest that the post-merger product of
NS-NS mergers might be fast-rotating supramassive QSs rather than NSs.

Yangian algebra following Drinfeld's original motivation to construct solutions
to the quantum Yang-Baxter equation. Different realizations of the Yangian and
its mathematical role as a Hopf algebra and quantum group are discussed. We
demonstrate how the Yangian algebra is implemented in quantum, two-dimensional
field theories and how its generators are renormalized. Implications of Yangian
symmetry on the two-dimensional scattering matrix are investigated. We
furthermore consider the important case of discrete Yangian symmetry realized
on integrable spin chains. Finally we give a brief introduction to Yangian
symmetry in planar, four-dimensional super Yang-Mills theory and indicate its

solving in the process the Heisenberg XXX spin chain. We discuss this famous

leading to finite-gap equations. Then we proceed to the more involved SU(3)

integrability in Durham, in the summer of 2015. It deals with a beautiful
method, developed in the mid-nineties by V.V. Bazhanov, S.L. Lukyanov and A.B.
Zamolodchikov and, as such, called BLZ. This method can be interpreted as a
field theory version of the quantum inverse scattering (QIS), also known as
algebraic Bethe ansatz (ABA). Starting with the case of conformal field
theories (CFT) we show how to build the field theory analogues of commuting
transfer T matrices and Baxter Q-operators of integrable lattice models. These
objects contain the complete information of the integrable structure of the
theory, viz. the integrals of motion, and can be used, as we will show, to
derive the thermodynamic Bethe ansatz (TBA) and non-linear integral (NLIE)
equations. This same method can be easily extended to the description of
integrable structures of certain particular massive deformations of CFTs;
these, in turn, can be described as quantum group reductions of the quantum
sine-Gordon model and it is an easy step to include this last theory in the
framework of BLZ approach. Finally we show an interesting and surprising
connection of the BLZ structures with classical objects emerging from the study
of classical integrable models via the inverse scattering transform method.
This connection goes under the name of ODE/IM correspondence and we will
present it for the specific case of quantum sine-Gordon model only.

Koml\'os, S\'ark\H{o}zy, and Szemer\'edi proved this conjecture using the
so-called Blow-Up Lemma. Here we extend their result to a random graph setting.
We show that for every $\epsilon > 0$ and $p=n^{-1/2+\epsilon}$ a.a.s. every
subgraph of $G_{n,p}$ with minimum degree at least $(2/3+\epsilon)np$ contains
the square of a cycle on $(1-o(1))n$ vertices. This is almost best possible in
three ways: (1) for $p\ll n^{-1/2}$ the random graph will not contain any
square of a long cycle (2) one cannot hope for a resilience version for the
square of a spanning cycle (as deleting all edges in the neighborhood of single
vertex destroys this property) and (3) for $c<2/3$ a.a.s. $G_{n,p}$ contains a
subgraph with minimum degree at least $cnp$ which does not contain the square
of a path on $(1/3+c)n$ vertices.

under the uniform distribution on $[N]=\{1,\ldots, N\}$ and under the
$P_N$-distribution on $\Omega_N$, have the same asymptotic decay profile as

frequencies. It has been studied at many frequencies and contains unique
information, which is not available for the majority of the pulsars. One of the
mysteries of these data, found by Moffett and Hankins twenty years ago, is the
shift of the IP at high radio frequencies compared to lower ones and return to
its previous position in the more high-frequency optical and X-ray range. We
propose the explanation of these mysterious changes with the frequency through
reflection of radiation by relativistic positrons from the star surface. The
magnetic field of the pulsar in the pole must be inclined to the surface of the
star and affects on the discussed processes. The positrons, which are
accelerated towards the surface of the star by the inner gap electric field,
radiate as half-bare particles. The spectral-angular properties of this
radiation differ from those ones of the electron curvature radiation inside the
gap.

  generic lines and one multiple linear space","44 pages",,,,"math.AG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  A well-known theorem by Hartshorne--Hirschowitz (\cite{HH}) states that a
generic union $\mathbb{X}\subset \PP^n$, $n\geq 3$, of lines has good
postulation with respect to the linear system $|\OO_{\PP^n}(d)|$. So a question
that arises naturally in studying the postulation of non-reduced positive
dimensional schemes supported on linear spaces is the question whether adding a
$m$-multiple linear space $m\PP^r$ to $\mathbb{X}$ can still preserve it's good
postulation, which means in classical language that, whether $m\PP^r$ imposes
independent conditions on the linear system $|\II_{\mathbb{X}}(d)|$. Recently,
the case of $r=0$, i.e., the case of lines and one $m$-multiple point, has been
completely solved by several authors (\cite{CCG4}, \cite{AB}, \cite{B1})
starting with Carlini--Catalisano--Geramita, while the case of $r>0$ was
remained unsolved, and this is what we wish to investigate in this paper.
Precisely, we study the postulation of a generic union of $s$ lines and one
$m$-multiple linear space $m\PP^r$ in $\PP^n$, $n\geq r+2$. Our main purpose is
to provide a complete answer to the question in the case of lines and one
double line, which says that the double line imposes independent conditions on
$|\II_{\mathbb{X}}(d)|$ except for the only case $\{n=4, s=2, d=2\}$.
  Moreover, we discuss an approach to the general case of lines and one
$m$-multiple linear space, $(m\geq 2, r\geq 1)$, particularly, we find several
exceptional such schemes, and we conjecture that these are the only exceptional
ones in this family. Finally, we give some partial results in support of our
conjecture.

  approaches","Journal of Biomedical Semantics, BioMed Central, 2016",,,,"cs.IR cs.CL","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  With the large and increasing volume of textual data, automated methods for
identifying significant topics to classify textual documents have received a
growing interest. While many efforts have been made in this direction, it still
remains a real challenge. Moreover, the issue is even more complex as full
texts are not always freely available. Then, using only partial information to
annotate these documents is promising but remains a very ambitious issue.
MethodsWe propose two classification methods: a k-nearest neighbours
(kNN)-based approach and an explicit semantic analysis (ESA)-based approach.
Although the kNN-based approach is widely used in text classification, it needs
to be improved to perform well in this specific classification problem which
deals with partial information. Compared to existing kNN-based methods, our
method uses classical Machine Learning (ML) algorithms for ranking the labels.
Additional features are also investigated in order to improve the classifiers'
performance. In addition, the combination of several learning algorithms with
various techniques for fixing the number of relevant topics is performed. On
the other hand, ESA seems promising for this classification task as it yielded
interesting results in related issues, such as semantic relatedness computation
between texts and text classification. Unlike existing works, which use ESA for
enriching the bag-of-words approach with additional knowledge-based features,
our ESA-based method builds a standalone classifier. Furthermore, we
investigate if the results of this method could be useful as a complementary
feature of our kNN-based approach.ResultsExperimental evaluations performed on
large standard annotated datasets, provided by the BioASQ organizers, show that
the kNN-based method with the Random Forest learning algorithm achieves good
performances compared with the current state-of-the-art methods, reaching a
competitive f-measure of 0.55% while the ESA-based approach surprisingly
yielded reserved results.ConclusionsWe have proposed simple classification
methods suitable to annotate textual documents using only partial information.
They are therefore adequate for large multi-label classification and
particularly in the biomedical domain. Thus, our work contributes to the
extraction of relevant information from unstructured documents in order to
facilitate their automated processing. Consequently, it could be used for
various purposes, including document indexing, information retrieval, etc.

mechanosensation of living cells (Schmidt et al. Proc Soc Natl Acad Sci USA
109: 10352-10357. 2012), the data were as conventionally done fitted by a
Boltzmann function. However, as also found for other data for ion channels,
this interpretation must be rejected in favor of a multiphasic profile, a
series of straight lines separated by discontinuous transitions, quite often in
the form of noncontiguities (jumps). The data points in the present study are
often very unevenly distributed around the curvilinear profiles. Thus, for 43
of the 75 profiles, the probability is less than 5% that the uneven
distribution is due to chance, for 26 the probability is less than 1%, and for
12 the probability is less than 0.1%, giving a vanishingly low overall
probability for all profiles. Especially at low voltages, the differences
between the fits to curvilinear and multiphasic profiles may be huge. In the
multiphasic profiles, adjacent lines are quite often parallel or nearly so, in
which case the transitions are, necessarily, in the form of jumps. The lines in
the multiphasic profiles appear to be perfectly straight, with no indication of
any curvilinearity. The r values are for the most part high, quite often
exceedingly high. In addition to activation of ion channels, a wide variety of
biological as well as non-biological processes and phenomena involving binding,
pH, folding/unfolding and effect of chain length can be well represented by
multiphasic profiles (Nissen 2015a,b, 2016. Posted on arXiv.org with Paper ID

These two types of patterns are complementary. In this paper, we propose a
generative topic embedding model to combine the two types of patterns. In our
model, topics are represented by embedding vectors, and are shared across
documents. The probability of each word is influenced by both its local context
and its topic. A variational inference method yields the topic embeddings as
well as the topic mixing proportions for each document. Jointly they represent
the document in a low-dimensional continuous space. In two document
classification tasks, our method performs better than eight existing methods,
with fewer features. In addition, we illustrate with an example that our method
can generate coherent topics even based on only one document.

demanding chance constraints. In this paper we use large deviations techniques
to study the probability of current and temperature overloads in power grids
with stochastic power injections, and develop corresponding safe capacity
regions. In particular, we characterize the set of admissible power injections
such that the probability of overloading of any line over a given time interval
stays below a fixed target. We show how enforcing (stochastic) constraints on
temperature, rather than on current, results in a less conservative approach
and can thus lead to capacity gains.

different cosmic observations. Introducing the massive neutrinos in
$\Lambda$CDM could potentially solve the tensions. Viable $f(R)$ gravity
producing $\Lambda$CDM background expansion with massive neutrinos is
investigated in this paper. We fit the current observational data: Planck-2015
CMB, RSD, BAO and SNIa to constrain the mass of neutrinos in viable $f(R)$
theory. The constraint results at 95\% confidence level are: $\Sigma
m_\nu<0.202$ eV for the active neutrino case, $m_{\nu, sterile}^{eff}<0.757$ eV
with $N_{eff}<3.22$ for the sterile neutrino case. For the effects by the mass
of neutrinos, the constraint results on model parameter at 95\% confidence
level become $f_{R0}\times 10^{-6}> -1.89$ and $f_{R0}\times 10^{-6}> -2.02$

several parameters much depend on the neutrino properties, such as the cold
dark matter density, the cosmological quantities at matter-radiation equality,
the neutrino density and the fraction of baryonic mass in helium. At last, the
constraint result shows that the tension between direct and CMB measurements of

survey large areas of the sky to milli-mag precision with rapid cadence. The
vast majority of the planetary and binary systems studied to date consist of
main-sequence or evolved objects, leading to a dearth of knowledge of
properties at early times (< 50 Myr). Only a dozen binaries and one candidate
transiting Hot Jupiter are known among pre-main sequence objects, yet these are
the systems that can provide the best constraints on stellar formation and
planetary migration models. The deficiency in the number of well-characterized
systems is driven by the inherent and aperiodic variability found in
pre-main-sequence objects, which can mask and mimic eclipse signals. Hence, a
dramatic increase in the number of young systems with high-quality observations
is highly desirable to guide further theoretical developments. We have recently
completed a photometric survey of 3 nearby (< 150 pc) and young (< 50 Myr)

  interface",,,"10.1002/2016JC012018",,"physics.flu-dyn","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The ratio of heat and salt flux is employed in ice-ocean models to represent
ice-ocean interactions. In this study, this flux ratio is determined from
direct numerical simulations of free convection beneath a melting, horizontal,
smooth ice-ocean interface. We find that the flux ratio at the interface is
three times as large as previously assessed based on turbulent-flux
measurements in the field. As a consequence, interface salinities and melt
rates are overestimated by up to 40\% if they are based on the three-equation
formulation. We also find that the interface flux ratio depends only very
weakly on the far-field conditions of the flow. Lastly, our simulations
indicate that estimates of the interface flux ratio based on direct
measurements of the turbulent fluxes will be difficult because at the interface
the diffusivities alone determine the mixing and the flux ratio varies with
depth. As an alternative, we present a consistent evaluation of the flux ratio
based on the total heat and salt fluxes across the boundary layer and reconcile
the determinations of the ice-ocean interface conditions.

Robertson-Walker (RW) spacetime. Here we go beyond this limitation and study
the influence of anisotropy on entanglement generated by dynamical spacetime.
Since the isotropic spacetime is viewed as a background medium and the
anisotropy is incorporated as perturbation, we decompose entanglement entropy
into isotropic and anisotropic contributions. The latter is shown to be
non-negligible by analyzing two cosmological models with weak and conformal
coupling. We also show the possibility of using entanglement to infer about
universe features.

experimental information concerning the recently discovered $Z_c(3900)^\pm$.
Within such scheme, the data can be similarly well described in two different
scenarios, where the $Z_c(3900)$ is either a resonance or a virtual state. To
shed light into the nature of this state, we apply this formalism in a finite
box with the aim of comparing with recent Lattice QCD (LQCD) simulations. We
see that the energy levels obtained for both scenarios agree well with those
obtained in the single-volume LQCD simulation reported in Prelovsek {\it et

disentangle between both possibilities. We also study the volume dependence of
the energy levels obtained with our formalism, and suggest that LQCD
simulations performed at several volumes could help in discerning the actual
nature of the intriguing $Z_c(3900)$ state.

worldsheets map into the same region in $\mathbb{R}^n$. An application of
strBUT is given in terms of the evaluation of Electroencephalography (EEG)

orientation (parallel or antiparallel to the direction of momentum) provide
considerable simplification in calculations. Hence, it is generally preferred
to use helicity basis during the calculations in Relativistic Quantum Mechanics
or Quantum Field Theory. Possibly because of the above reason, the Dirac
spinors describing a general spin orientation have been ignored in many
textbooks. Although the helicity eigenstates give almost complete understanding
of the behavior of the free Dirac solutions, the zero-mass limit is one of its
exception. The zero-mass behavior of the free spinor with general spin
orientation and its relation with chirality eigenstates has been skipped in
textbooks and hence it deserves a clear, detailed investigation. In this paper
we obtain the free Dirac spinors describing a general spin orientation and
examine their zero-mass limit. We also briefly discuss some of the implications
of this small-mass behavior of the spinors on particle physics.
