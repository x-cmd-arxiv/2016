villous trees in the placenta. In this paper, we simulate blood flow and oxygen
transfer in feto-placental capillaries by converting three-dimensional
representations of villous and capillary surfaces, reconstructed from confocal
laser scanning microscopy, to finite-element meshes, and calculating values of
vascular flow resistance and total oxygen transfer. The relationship between
the total oxygen transfer rate and the pressure drop through the capillary is
shown to be captured across a wide range of pressure drops by physical scaling
laws and an upper bound on the oxygen transfer rate. A regression equation is
introduced that can be used to estimate the oxygen transfer in a capillary
using the vascular resistance. Two techniques for quantifying the effects of
statistical variability, experimental uncertainty and pathological placental
structure on the calculated properties are then introduced. First, scaling
arguments are used to quantify the sensitivity of the model to uncertainties in
the geometry and the parameters. Second, the effects of localized dilations in
fetal capillaries are investigated using an idealized axisymmetric model, to
quantify the possible effect of pathological placental structure on oxygen
transfer. The model predicts how, for a fixed pressure drop through a
capillary, oxygen transfer is maximized by an optimal width of the dilation.
The results could explain the prevalence of fetal hypoxia in cases of delayed
villous maturation, a pathology characterized by a lack of the
vasculo-syncytial membranes often seen in conjunction with localized capillary
dilations.

of our approach allows us to simultaneously answer questions of rectification
and of changing the base model category to a Quillen equivalent one. We work in
the setting of colored operads, and we do not require them to be
$\Sigma$-cofibrant. Special cases of our main theorem recover many known
results regarding rectification and change of model category, as well as
numerous new results. In particular, we recover a recent result of
Richter-Shipley about a zig-zag of Quillen equivalences between commutative
$H\mathbb{Q}$-algebra spectra and commutative differential graded
$\mathbb{Q}$-algebras, but our version involves only three Quillen equivalences
instead of six. We also work out the theory of how to lift Quillen equivalences
to categories of colored operad algebras after a left Bousfield localization.

  predicting the vascular transport of differently shaped particles",,,,,"physics.flu-dyn","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Modelling the vascular transport and adhesion of man-made particles is
crucial for optimizing their efficacy in the detection and treatment of
diseases. Here, a Lattice Boltzmann and Immersed Boundary methods are combined
together for predicting the near wall dynamics of particles with different
shapes in a laminar flow. For the lattice Boltzmann modelling, a Gauss-Hermite
projection is used to derive the lattice equation, wall boundary conditions are
imposed through the Zou-He framework, and a moving least squares algorithm
accurately reconstructs the forcing term accounting for the immersed boundary.
First, the computational code is validated against two well-known test cases:
the sedimentation of circular and elliptical cylinders in a quiescent fluid. A
very good agreement is observed between the present results and those available
in the literature. Then, the transport of circular, elliptical, rectangular,
square and triangular particles is analyzed in a Couette flow, at Re=20. All
particles drifted laterally across the stream lines reaching an equilibrium
position, independently of the initial conditions. For this large Reynolds
number, the particle shape has no significant effect on the final equilibrium
position but it does affect the absolute value and periodicity of the angular
velocity. Specifically, elongated particles show longer oscillation periods
and, most interestingly, larger variations in angular velocity. The longest
particles exhibit a zero angular velocity for almost the whole rotational
period. Collectively, this data demonstrates that the proposed approach can be
efficiently used for predicting complex particle dynamics in biologically
relevant flows. This computational strategy could have significant impact in
the field of computational nanomedicine for optimizing the specific delivery of
therapeutic and imaging agents.

  presentation at ALife XV (July 4-8, 2016, Cancun, Mexico)",,,,"cs.OH","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Is undecidability a requirement for open-ended evolution (OEE)? Using methods
derived from algorithmic complexity theory, we propose robust computational
definitions of open-ended evolution and the adaptability of computable
dynamical systems. Within this framework, we show that decidability imposes
absolute limits to the stable growth of complexity in computable dynamical
systems. Conversely, systems that exhibit (strong) open-ended evolution must be
undecidable, establishing undecidability as a requirement for such systems.
Complexity is assessed in terms of three measures: sophistication, coarse
sophistication and busy beaver logical depth. These three complexity measures
assign low complexity values to random (incompressible) objects. As time grows,
the stated complexity measures allow for the existence of complex states during
the evolution of a computable dynamical system. We show, however, that finding
these states involves undecidable computations. We conjecture that for similar
complexity measures that assign low complexity values, decidability imposes
comparable limits to the stable growth of complexity, and that such behaviour
is necessary for non-trivial evolutionary systems. We show that the
undecidability of adapted states imposes novel and unpredictable behaviour on
the individuals or populations being modelled. Such behaviour is irreducible.
Finally, we offer an example of a system, first proposed by Chaitin, that
exhibits strong OEE.

However, the distribution of such modes over large distances remains difficult.
Intermodal coupling complicates their use with common fibers, while free-space
transmission is thought to be strongly influenced by atmospheric turbulence.
Here we show the transmission of orbital angular momentum modes of light over a
distance of 143 kilometers between two Canary Islands, which is 50 times
greater than the maximum distance achieved previously. As a demonstration of
the transmission quality, we use superpositions of these modes to encode a
short message. At the receiver, an artificial neural network is used for
distinguishing between the different twisted light superpositions. The
algorithm is able to identify different mode superpositions with an accuracy of
more than 80% up to the third mode order, and decode the transmitted message
with an error rate of 8.33%. Using our data, we estimate that the distribution
of orbital angular momentum entanglement over more than 100 kilometers of free
space is feasible. Moreover, the quality of our free-space link can be further
improved by the use of state-of-the-art adaptive optics systems.

GeV longitudinally polarized $p$$+$$p$ collisions at the Relativistic Heavy Ion

energy, $J/\psi$ particles are predominantly produced through gluon-gluon

inside the proton. We measured $A_{LL}^{J/\psi}$ by detecting the decay
daughter muon pairs $\mu^+ \mu^-$ within the PHENIX muon spectrometers in the

$A_{LL}^{J/\psi}$ to be $0.012 \pm 0.010$~(stat)~$\pm$~$0.003$(syst). The
$A_{LL}^{J/\psi}$ can be expressed to be proportional to the product of the
gluon polarization distributions at two distinct ranges of Bjorken $x$: one at
moderate range $x \approx 0.05$ where recent RHIC data of jet and $\pi^0$
double helicity spin asymmetries have shown evidence for significant gluon
polarization, and the other one covering the poorly known small-$x$ region $x

constrain the gluon polarization for $x< 0.05$.

  permanent magnets in 2D and 3D",,,,,"cond-mat.supr-con","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The ability of stacks of superconducting tapes to trap large magnetic fields
makes them ideal candidates for creating powerful permanent magnets of compact
size and mass. Experimentally, several techniques are used to trap the maximum
possible field in a given practical application. However, regardless of the
magnetization method used, there is a physical limit to the maximum magnetic
field that a given superconducting magnet can trap. This limit is given by the
geometric design, the particular superconducting material used and the
temperature of operation. Knowing the maximum possible trapped field is
important for device design as it provides an upper limit for applications such
as magnetic bearings or rotating machinery. In this work we present a
collection of finite element method (FEM) models in 2D and 3D capable of
estimating the maximum trapped field of stacked tape superconducting magnets.
The models are computationally fast and can be used to perform parametric
studies with ease. For the case of square stacks tape magnets, various sizes
are considered and their estimated maximum trapped field is compared with
experimental results.

fits to the gluon Sivers function obtained recently by D'Alesio {\it et al.,}
by fitting to the asymmetry data for the process $p+p^\uparrow \rightarrow

asymmetry predictions which lie in a broad range, $0.5\%\lesssim
A_N\lesssim10\%$ for the kinematic regions considered. This is to be compared
with the upper bound of 18\% expected for the maximal gluon Sivers function. We
extend our analysis to two other centre of mass energies of proposed
experiments - AFTER@LHC $(\sqrt{s}=115\text{ GeV})$ and a future RHIC run
$(\sqrt{s}=500\text{ GeV})$. We further investigate (at $\sqrt{s}=200$ GeV) the
effect of the transverse momentum dependent (TMD) evolution of the unpolarized
parton distribution functions (pdf's) and of the gluon Sivers function on the
asymmetry predictions. We perform this study using an evolution setup given by
Anselmino {\it et al}. We find that the effect of evolution is an overall
reduction of the asymmetry predictions. For example, for the saturated gluon
Sivers function, upon taking into account TMD evolution, peak asymmetry
predictions reduce by a factor 3 or more. This decrease is similar to that
noticed earlier for Single Spin Asymmetries (SSA) in the electroproduction of
$J/\psi$.

appears in physics in the form of labels on relativistic fields or Schrodinger

Mackey, that generically, such polarizations contain a fundamental length scale
and that contrary to what is implied by the Schrodinger polarization, they
possess topologically distinct spectra. These are the modular spaces. We show
that they naturally come equipped with additional geometrical structures
usually encountered in the context of string theory or generalized geometry.
Moreover, we show how modular space reconciles the presence of a fundamental

with limit behaviors of infinite plays: e.g., mean-payoff and total-payoff in
the quantitative setting, or parity in the qualitative one (a canonical way to
encode omega-regular properties). Those objectives offer powerful abstraction
mechanisms and often yield nice properties such as memoryless determinacy.
However, their very nature provides no guarantee on time bounds within which
something good can be witnessed. In this work, we consider two approaches
toward inclusion of time bounds in parity games. The first one, parity-response
games, is based on the notion of finitary parity games [CHH09] and parity games
with costs [FZ14,WZ16]. The second one, window parity games, is inspired by
window mean-payoff games [CDRR15]. We compare the two approaches and show that
while they prove to be equivalent in some contexts, window parity games offer a
more tractable alternative when the time bound is given as a parameter (P-c.
vs. PSPACE-c.). In particular, it provides a conservative approximation of
parity games computable in polynomial time. Furthermore, we extend both
approaches to the multi-dimension setting. We give the full picture for both
types of games with regard to complexity and memory bounds.

Join-Idle-Queue algorithm, where a group of dispatchers distribute jobs to a
cluster of parallel servers. Each dispatcher maintains a queue of idle servers;
when a job arrives to a dispatcher, it sends it to a server on its queue, or to
a random server if the queue is empty. In turn, when a server has no jobs, it
requests to be placed on the idle queue of a randomly chosen dispatcher.
  Although this algorithm was shown to be quite effective, the original
asymptotic analysis makes simplifying assumptions that become increasingly
inaccurate as the system load increases. Further, the analysis does not
naturally generalize to interesting variations, such as having a server request
to be placed on the idle queue of a dispatcher before it has completed all
jobs, which can be beneficial under high loads.
  We provide a new asymptotic analysis of Join-Idle-Queue systems based on mean
field fluid limit methods, deriving families of differential equations that
describe these systems. Our analysis avoids previous simplifying assumptions,
is empirically more accurate, and generalizes naturally to the variation
described above, as well as other simple variations. Our theoretical and
empirical analyses shed further light on the performance of Join-Idle-Queue,
including potential performance pitfalls under high load.

subjects answer arithmetic questions under low and high stress conditions while
having their GSR monitored using a wearable biosensor. Using only the GSR
measured under low stress conditions, we are able to predict which subjects
will perform well under high stress conditions, achieving an area under the

calibrations for the WFC and HRC filters. The external uncertainty for the
absolute flux is $\sim$1\%, while the internal consistency of the sensitivities
in the broadband ACS filters is $\sim$0.3\% among the three primary WD flux
standards. For stars as cool as K type, the agreement with the CALSPEC
standards is within 1\% at the WFC1-1K subarray position, which achieves the
1\% precision goal for the first time. After making a small adjustment to the

their cavities at the orthorhombic-to-tetragonal phase transition, plays a key

presence of extra peaks in the experimental spectra that have been a source of
confusion in earlier studies. We discuss singular features, in particular the
torsional vibration of the C-N axis, which is the only molecular mode that is
strongly influenced by the size of the lattice. From analysis of the spectral

hence indicate the presence of ice cover on the surface. Icy moons might have
subsurface oceans thus these may potentially be habitable. The objective of our
paper is to determine whether next generation telescopes will be capable of
albedo estimations for icy exomoons using their occultation light curves. The
success of the measurements depends on the depth of the moon's occultation in
the light curve and on the sensitivity of the used instruments. We applied
simple calculations for different stellar masses in the V and J photometric
bands, and compared the flux drop caused by the moon's occultation and the
estimated photon noise of next generation missions with 5 $\sigma$ confidence.
We found that albedo estimation by this method is not feasible for moons of
solar-like stars, but small M dwarfs are better candidates for such
measurements. Our calculations in the J photometric band show that E-ELT
MICADO's photon noise is just about 4 ppm greater than the flux difference
caused by a 2 Earth-radii icy satellite in a circular orbit at the snowline of
an 0.1 stellar mass star. However, considering only photon noise underestimates
the real expected noise, because other noise sources, such as CCD read-out and
dark signal become significant in the near infrared measurements. Hence we
conclude that occultation measurements with next generation missions are far
too challenging, even in the case of large, icy moons at the snowline of small
M dwarfs. We also discuss the role of the parameters that were neglected in the
calculations, e.g. inclination, eccentricity, orbiting direction of the moon.
We predict that the first albedo estimations of exomoons will probably be made
for large icy moons around the snowline of M4 -- M9 type main sequence stars.

our earlier theoretical investigations on general relativistic

plasma can develop into a standing shock for suitable physical conditions
causing the downstream flow to be sufficiently hot due to shock compression. We
numerically calculate to examine, for sets of fiducial plasma parameters, a
physical nature of fast MHD shocks under strong gravity for different BH spins.
We show that thermal seed photons from the standard accretion disk can be
effectively Compton up-scattered by the energized sub-relativistic electrons in
the hot downstream plasma to produce the soft excess feature in X-rays. As a
case study, we construct a three-parameter Comptonization model of inclination

spatially separated, drag-free satellites sharing ultra-stable optical laser
light over a single baseline. Each satellite contains an optical lattice atomic
clock, which serves as a sensitive, narrowband detector of the local frequency
of the shared laser light. A synchronized two-clock comparison between the
satellites will be sensitive to the effective Doppler shifts induced by
incident gravitational waves (GWs) at a level competitive with other proposed
space-based GW detectors, while providing complementary features. The detected
signal is a differential frequency shift of the shared laser light due to the
relative velocity of the satellites, and the detection window can be tuned
through the control sequence applied to the atoms' internal states. This scheme
enables the detection of GWs from continuous, spectrally narrow sources, such
as compact binary inspirals, with frequencies ranging from ~3 mHz - 10 Hz
without loss of sensitivity, thereby bridging the detection gap between
space-based and terrestrial optical interferometric GW detectors. Our proposed
GW detector employs just two satellites, is compatible with integration with an
optical interferometric detector, and requires only realistic improvements to
existing ground-based clock and laser technologies.

can operate in a resonant mode for increased sensitivity. By oscillating the
positions of the atomic wavepackets, this resonant detection mode allows for
coherently enhanced, narrow-band sensitivity at target frequencies. The
proposed detector is flexible and can be rapidly switched between broadband and
narrow-band detection modes. For instance, a binary discovered in broadband
mode can subsequently be studied further as the inspiral evolves by using a
tailored narrow-band detector response. In addition to functioning like a
lock-in amplifier for astrophysical events, the enhanced sensitivity of the
resonant approach also opens up the possibility of searching for important
cosmological signals, including the stochastic gravitational wave background
produced by inflation. We give an example of detector parameters which would
allow detection of inflationary gravitational waves down to $\Omega_\text{GW}

quantum field-theoretical representation of the model can be solved exactly by
means of classical stochastic electrodynamics simulations for stationary atoms
that represent cold atomic ensembles. Simulations for the optical response of
atoms in a quantum degenerate regime require one to synthesize a stochastic
ensemble of atomic positions that generates the corresponding quantum
statistical position correlations between the atoms. In the case of multiple

classical simulations require approximations that neglect quantum fluctuations
between the levels. We show how the model is extended to incorporate

processes. In the low light intensity limit we illustrate the simulations in a
system of atoms in a Mott-insulator state in a 2D optical lattice, where
recurrent scattering of light induces strong interatomic correlations. These

In this paper, we develop novel deep learning models, namely GRU-D, as one of
the early attempts. GRU-D is based on Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU), a
state-of-the-art recurrent neural network. It takes two representations of
missing patterns, i.e., masking and time interval, and effectively incorporates
them into a deep model architecture so that it not only captures the long-term
temporal dependencies in time series, but also utilizes the missing patterns to
achieve better prediction results. Experiments of time series classification

provides useful insights for better understanding and utilization of missing

for example as an approximation to transmission delays, excitatory-inhibitory

chimeras with phase separation of $0$ or $\pi$ between populations, and states
where both populations remain desynchronized. These desynchronized states
exhibit stable, oscillatory, and even chaotic dynamics. Moreover, we identify
the bifurcations through which chimeras emerge. Stable chimera states and
desynchronized solutions, which do not arise for homogeneous phase-lag
parameters, emerge as a result of competition between synchronized in-phase,
anti-phase equilibria, and fully incoherent states when the phase-lags are near

The calculations are performed at the first and second order in the continued

equation with the following property: once the initial value is positive, the
solution tends to the unique positive equilibrium. Introducing additive
perturbations can change this picture: we give examples of difference equations
experiencing additive perturbations which have solutions staying around zero
rather than tending to the unique positive equilibrium. When perturbations are
stochastic with a bounded support, we give an upper estimate for the
probability that the solution can stay around zero. Applying extra conditions
on the behavior of the map function $f$ at zero or on the amplitudes of
stochastic perturbations, we prove that the solution tends to the unique
positive equilibrium almost surely. In particular, this holds either for all
amplitudes when the right derivative of the map $f$ at zero exceeds one or,
independently of the behavior of $f$ at zero, when the amplitudes are not
square summable.

in four dimensions the result is a specific form of the $f(R,G)$ model. This
specific $f(R,G)$ satisfies the stability conditions and possesses
self-accelerating solutions. Our model is consistent with the local tests of
gravity since its behavior is the same as in GR for the high-curvature regime.
In the low-curvature regime the gravitational force is weaker than in GR, which
can be interpreted as the existence of a repulsive fifth force for very large
scales. Interestingly, there is an intermediate-curvature regime where the
gravitational force is stronger in our model compared to GR. The different
behavior of our model in comparison with GR in both low- and

essentially do not depend on the wave vector. At $T=0$ the conductivity of
graphene is real and equal to $\sigma_0=e^2/(4\hbar)$ up to small nonlocal

between $\sigma_0$ at low $T$ and zero at high $T$. The imaginary part of the

accordance to the obtained asymptotic expressions, at fixed $T$ it varies from
infinity at $\omega=0$ to a negative minimum value reached at some $\omega$,

path and the science path represent a critical limitation for the detection of
giant planets with a contrast lower than a few $10^{-6}$ at very small

wavefront sensor based on Zernike phase contrast methods to circumvent this
issue and measure these quasi-static aberrations at a nanometric level. We
present the design, manufacturing and testing of ZELDA, a prototype that was
installed on VLT/SPHERE during its reintegration in Chile. Using the internal
light source of the instrument, we performed measurements in the presence of
Zernike or Fourier modes introduced with the deformable mirror. Our
experimental and simulation results are consistent, confirming the ability of
our sensor to measure small aberrations (<50 nm rms) with nanometric accuracy.
We then corrected the long-lived non-common path aberrations in SPHERE based on
ZELDA measurements. We estimated a contrast gain of 10 in the coronagraphic
image at 0.2\as, reaching the raw contrast limit set by the coronagraph in the
instrument. The simplicity of the design and its phase reconstruction algorithm
makes ZELDA an excellent candidate for the on-line measurements of quasi-static
aberrations during the observations. The implementation of a ZELDA-based

coalesce by redshift zero. For a variety of parameters, we find all GWB

predicts an amplitude of $A_{\textrm{yr}^{-1}} \approx 0.4\times

driving the GWB signal come from redshifts around $0.3$, with total masses of a

Here, however, the emergent dimension is a lattice, with momenta related to the

interleaved with Clifford gates. This gate-synthesis problem is well understood
for multiqubit gates that do not use any Hadamards. We present an in-depth
analysis of a unified framework that realises one round of distillation and
multiqubit gate synthesis in a single step. We call these synthillation
protocols, and show they lead to a large reduction in resource overheads. This
is because synthillation can implement a general class of circuits using the
same number of T-states as gate synthesis, yet with the benefit of quadratic
error suppression. This general class includes all circuits primarily dominated
by control-control-Z gates, such as adders and modular exponentiation routines
used in Shor's algorithm. Therefore, synthillation removes the need for a
costly round of magic state distillation. We also present several additional
results on the multiqubit gate-synthesis problem. We provide an efficient
algorithm for synthesizing unitaries with the same worst-case resource scaling
as optimal solutions. For the special case of synthesizing
controlled-unitaries, our techniques are not just efficient but exactly
optimal. We observe that the gate-synthesis cost, measured by T-count, is often
strictly subadditive. Numerous explicit applications of our techniques are also
presented.

detailed treatment of chemical enrichment and stellar feedback. The IGIMF
provides an analytic description of the dependence of the stellar IMF shape on
the rate of star formation in galaxies. We find that our model with a universal
IMF predicts a rather flat [$\alpha$/Fe]-stellar mass relation. The model
assuming the IGIMF, instead, is able to reproduce the observed increase of
$\alpha$-enhancement with stellar mass, in agreement with previous studies.
This is mainly due to the fact that massive galaxies are characterized by
larger star formation rates at high-redshift, leading to stronger
$\alpha$-enhancement with respect to low-mass galaxies. At the same time, the
IGIMF hypothesis does not affect significantly the trend for shorter star
formation timescales for more massive galaxies. We argue that in the IGIMF
scenario the [$\alpha$/Fe] ratios are good tracers of the highest star
formation events. The final stellar masses and mass-to-light-ratio of our model
massive galaxies are larger than those estimated from the synthetic photometry
assuming a universal IMF, providing a self-consistent interpretation of similar
recent results, based on dynamical analysis of local early type galaxies.

inhabit galactic nuclei, coexisting in a range of bulge masses, but excluding
each other in the largest or smallest galaxies. We propose that the
transformation of NSCs into SMBHs occurs via runaway tidal captures, once NSCs
exceed a certain critical central density and velocity dispersion. The
bottleneck in this process, as with all collisional runaways, is growing the
first e-fold in black hole mass. The growth of a stellar mass black hole past
this bottleneck occurs as tidally captured stars are consumed in repeated
episodes of mass transfer at pericenter. Tidal captures may turn off as a
growth channel once the black hole reaches a mass ~100-1000 solar masses, but
tidal disruption events will continue and appear capable of growing the seed
SMBH to larger sizes. The runaway slows (becomes sub-exponential) once the seed
SMBH consumes the core of its host NSC. While the bulk of the cosmic mass
density in SMBHs is ultimately produced (via the Soltan-Paczynski argument) by
episodic gaseous accretion in very massive galaxies, the smallest SMBHs have
probably grown from strong tidal encounters with NSC stars. SMBH seeds that
grow for a time $t$ entirely through this channel will follow simple power law
relations with the velocity dispersion, $\sigma$, of their host galaxy. In the
simplest regime it is $M_\bullet \sim \sigma^{3/2}\sqrt{M_\star t / G} \sim
10^{6}M_\odot (\sigma / 50~{\rm km~s}^{-1})^{3/2}(t/10^{10}~{\rm yr})^{1/2}$,

loss cone refilling. Current tidal disruption event rates predicted from this

properties are widely used to estimate masses and radii of stars exhibiting
solar-like oscillations. Since the mass and radius of the Sun are known
independently, the Sun is commonly used as a reference to scale to. However,
the validity of the scaling relations depends on the homology between the star
under study and the reference star. Solar-like oscillators span a wide range of
masses and metallicities, as well as evolutionary phases. Most of these stars
are therefore not homologous to the Sun. This leads to errors of up to 10% (5%)
in mass (radius) when using the asteroseismic scaling relations with the Sun as
the reference. In this paper we derive a reference function to replace the
solar-reference value used in the large-frequency-separation scaling relation.
Our function is the first that depends on both effective temperature and
metallicity, and is applicable from the end of the main sequence to just above

graph. It is known that the PIVD problem is fixed-parameter tractable and
admits a polynomial but ""unreasonably"" large kernel of $O(k^{53})$ vertices. A
natural question is whether the problem admits a polynomial kernel of
""reasonable"" size. In this paper, we answer this question by deriving an
$O(k^7)$-vertex kernel for the PIVD problem. Our kernelization is based on
several new observations and a refined analysis of the kernelization.

measurement of rotation in solar-type field stars, but also the determination
of reliable masses and ages from asteroseismology. These critical data have
recently provided the first opportunity to calibrate rotation-age relations for
stars older than the Sun. The evolutionary picture that emerges is surprising:
beyond middle-age the efficiency of magnetic braking is dramatically reduced,
implying a fundamental change in angular momentum loss beyond a critical Rossby
number (Ro~2). We compile published chromospheric activity measurements for the
sample of Kepler asteroseismic targets that were used to establish the new
rotation-age relations. We use these data along with a sample of well
characterized solar analogs from the Mount Wilson HK survey to develop a
qualitative scenario connecting the evolution of chromospheric activity to a
fundamental shift in the character of differential rotation. We conclude that
the Sun may be in a transitional evolutionary phase, and that its magnetic
cycle might represent a special case of stellar dynamo theory.

several variables. A ridge function is constant along several directions in its
domain, so fitting occurs on the coordinates of a low-dimensional subspace of
the input space. We review essential theory for ridge approximation---e.g., the
best mean-squared approximation and an optimal low-dimensional subspace---and
we prove that the gradient-based active subspace is near-stationary for the
least-squares problem that defines an optimal subspace. Motivated by the
theory, we propose a computational heuristic that uses an estimated active
subspace as an initial guess for a ridge approximation fitting problem. We show
a simple example where the heuristic fails, which reveals a type of function
for which the proposed approach is inappropriate. We then propose a simple
alternating heuristic for fitting a ridge function, and we demonstrate the
effectiveness of the active subspace initial guess applied to an airfoil model

Lorentz force pushes the electrons off course in their excursion and suppresses

be used to monitor, control, and cancel the effect of the Lorentz force. This
arrangement can thus be used to re-enable recollision-based phenomena in

it can be used to observe this breakdown in high-harmonic generation using

vehicle routing problems. Currently, the most used ones can be fitted into two
classes, namely vehicle flow formulations and set partitioning formulations.
These types of formulations differ from each other not only due to their
variables and constraints but also due to their main features. Vehicle flow
formulations have the advantage of being compact models, so general-purpose
optimization packages can be used to straightforwardly solve them. However,
they typically show weak linear relaxations and have a large number of
constraints. Branch-and-cut methods based on specialized valid inequalities can
also be devised to solve these formulations, but they have not shown to be
effective for large-scale instances. On the other hand, set partitioning
formulations have stronger linear relaxations, but requires the implementation
of sophisticate techniques such as column generation and specialized
branch-and-price methods. Due to all these reasons, so far it is has been
recognized in the vehicle routing community that these two types of
formulations are rather different. In this paper, we show that they are
actually strongly related as they correspond to special cases of a generalized

some geometric features in non-geometric theories. First, we have found what
symmetry is T-dual to the local gauge transformations. It includes
transformations of background fields but does not include transformations of
the coordinates. According to this we have introduced a new, up to now missing
term, with additional gauge field $A^D_i$ (D denotes components with Dirichlet
boundary conditions). It compensates non-fulfilment of the invariance under
such transformations on the end-points of an open string, and the standard
gauge field $A^N_a$ (N denotes components with Neumann boundary conditions)
compensates non-fulfilment of the gauge invariance. Using a generalized
procedure we will perform T-duality of vector fields linear in coordinates. We
show that gauge fields $A^N_a$ and $A^D_i$ are T-dual to ${}^\star A_D^a$ and
${}^\star A_N^i$ respectively.
  We introduce the field strength of T-dual non-geometric theories as
derivatives of T-dual gauge fields along both T-dual variable $y_\mu$ and its
double ${\tilde y}_\mu$. This definition allows us to obtain gauge
transformation of non-geometric theories which leaves the T-dual field strength
invariant. Therefore, we introduce some new features of non-geometric theories
where field strength has both antisymmetric and symmetric parts. This allows us
to define new kinds of truly non-geometric theories.

uncoordinated multiple random access in wireless networks. However, such
distributed operation of the Medium Access Control (MAC) layer leads to
sub-optimal utilization of the shared channel. One of the reasons is the
occurrence of collisions when more than one packet is transmitted at the same
time. These packets cannot be decoded and retransmissions are necessary.
However, it has been recently shown that it is possible to apply signal
processing techniques with these collided packets so that useful information
can be decoded. This was recently proposed in the Irregular Repetition Slotted
ALOHA (IRSA), achieving a throughput $T \simeq 0.97$ for very large MAC frame
lengths as long as the number of active users is smaller than the number of
slots per frame. In this paper, we extend the operation of IRSA with i) an
iterative physical layer decoding processing that exploits the capture effect
and ii) a Successive Interference Cancellation (SIC) processing at the
slot-level, named intra-slot SIC, to decode more than one colliding packet per
slot. We evaluate the performance of the proposed scheme, referred to as
Extended IRSA (E-IRSA), in terms of throughput and channel capacity.
Computer-based simulation results show that E-IRSA protocol allows to reach the
maximum theoretical achievable throughput even in scenarios where the number of
active users is higher than the number of slots per frame. Results also show
that E-IRSA protocol significantly improves the performance even for small MAC

work is to study in detail an area of the Galactic plane in Carina. We analyze
the properties of different stellar populations and focus on a sample of open
clusters and their population of YSOs and highly reddened early stars. We also
studied the stellar mass distribution in these clusters and the possible
scenario of their formation. Finally, we outline the Galactic spiral structure
in this direction. We obtained photometric data for six young open clusters
located in Carina at l = 291, and their adjacent stellar fields, which we
complemented with spectroscopic observations of a few selected targets. We also
culled additional information from the literature. Our results provide more
reliable estimates of distances, color excesses, masses, and ages of the
stellar populations in this direction. We estimate the basic parameters of the
studied clusters and find that they identify two overdensities of young stellar
populations. We find evidence of PMS populations inside them, with an apparent
coeval stellar formation in the most conspicuous clusters. We also discuss
apparent age and distance gradients in the direction NW-SE. We study the mass
distributions of several clusters in the region. They consistently show a
canonical IMF slope. We discover and characterise an abnormally reddened
massive stellar population. Spectroscopic observations of ten stars of this

reflection of neutrons from the SM coating for one spin-component and total
absorption for the other, thus providing a perfectly polarized neutron beam at
the exit. However, in practice, the substrate's neutron-nucleai optical
potential does not match perfectly that for spin-down neutrons in the SM. For a
positive step in the optical potential (as in a Fe/SiN(x) SM on Si substrate),
this mismatch results in spin-independent total reflection for neutrons with
small momentum transfer Q, limiting the useful neutron bandwidth in the low-Q
region. To overcome this limitation, we propose to replace Si single-crystal
substrates by media with higher optical potential than that for spin-down
neutrons in the SM ferromagnetic layers. We found single-crystal sapphire and
single-crystal quartz as good candidates for solid-state Fe/SiN(x) SM
polarizers. To verify this idea, we coated a thick plate of single-crystal
sapphire with a m=2.4 Fe/SiN(x) SM. At the T3 instrument at the ILL, we
measured the spin-up and spin-down reflectivity curves with 7.5 A neutrons
incident from the substrate to the interface between the substrate and the SM
coating. The results of this experimental test were in excellent agreement with
our expectations: the bandwidth of high polarizing power extended significantly
into the low-Q region. This finding, together with the possibility to apply a
strong magnetizing field, opens a new road to produce high-efficient

include all data taken by the BICEP2 & Keck Array CMB polarization experiments
up to and including the 2014 observing season (BK14). Despite their modest
angular resolution ($\sim 0.5^\circ$), the excellent sensitivity ($\sim
3\mu$K-arcmin) of these maps makes it possible to directly reconstruct the
lensing potential using only information at larger angular scales ($\ell\leq
700$). From the auto-spectrum of the reconstructed potential we measure an
amplitude of the spectrum to be $A^{\phi\phi}_{\rm L}=1.15\pm 0.36$ (Planck
$\Lambda$CDM prediction corresponds to $A^{\phi\phi}_{\rm L}=1$), and reject
the no-lensing hypothesis at 5.8$\sigma$, which is the highest significance
achieved to date using an EB lensing estimator. Taking the cross-spectrum of
the reconstructed potential with the Planck 2015 lensing map yields
$A^{\phi\phi}_{\rm L}=1.13\pm 0.20$. These direct measurements of
$A^{\phi\phi}_{\rm L}$ are consistent with the $\Lambda$CDM cosmology, and with
that derived from the previously reported BK14 B-mode auto-spectrum ($A^{\rm
BB}_{\rm L}=1.20\pm 0.17$). We perform a series of null tests and consistency
checks to show that these results are robust against systematics and are
insensitive to analysis choices. These results unambiguously demonstrate that
the B-modes previously reported by BICEP / Keck at intermediate angular scales
($150\lesssim\ell\lesssim 350$) are dominated by gravitational lensing. The
good agreement between the lensing amplitudes obtained from the lensing
reconstruction and B-mode spectrum starts to place constraints on any
alternative cosmological sources of B-modes at these angular scales.

pre-specified ordering of the null hypotheses, from most to least promising. We
analyze and compare the power of several recent proposals using the asymptotic
framework of Li & Barber (2015). While accumulation tests including ForwardStop
can be quite powerful when the ordering is very informative, they are
asymptotically powerless when the ordering is weaker. By contrast, Selective
SeqStep, proposed by Barber & Cand\`es (2015), is much less sensitive to the
quality of the ordering. We compare the power of these procedures in different
r\'egimes, concluding that Selective SeqStep dominates accumulation tests if
either the ordering is weak or non-null hypotheses are sparse or weak.
Motivated by our asymptotic analysis, we derive an improved version of
Selective SeqStep which we call Adaptive SeqStep, analogous to Storey's
improvement on the Benjamini-Hochberg procedure. We compare these methods using
the GEOQuery data set analyzed by Li & Barber (2015) and find Adaptive SeqStep
has favorable performance for both good and bad prior orderings.

To achieve that, we first construct a system call graph that consists of system

distinguishing features of various malware species, we study social network
properties as applied to the call graph, including the degree distribution,
degree centrality, average distance, clustering coefficient, network density,

a classifier for malware families. Our experimental results show that
influence-based graph metrics such as the degree centrality are effective for
classifying malware, whereas the general structural metrics of malware are less
effective for classifying malware. Our experiments demonstrate that the
proposed system performs well in detecting and classifying malware families
within each malware class with accuracy greater than 96%.

  This paper presents execution templates, a control plane abstraction for

leverage highly repetitive control flow to cache scheduling decisions as {\it
templates}. Rather than reschedule hundreds of thousands of tasks on every loop
execution, nodes instantiate these templates. A controller's template specifies
the execution across all worker nodes, which it partitions into per-worker
templates. To ensure that templates execute correctly, controllers dynamically
patch templates to match program control flow. We have implemented execution
templates in Nimbus, a C++ cloud computing framework. Running in Nimbus,
analytics benchmarks can run 16-43 times faster than in Naiad and Spark.
Nimbus's control plane can scale out to run these faster benchmarks on up to

in a broad and general fashion whenever a given game universe is {\em

parentality} and {\em saturation}, and we prove that the latter is implied by
the former. Parentality means that any pair of non-empty finite sets of games
is admissible as options, and saturation means that, given any game, the first
player can be favored in a disjunctive sum. Game comparison is at the core of
combinatorial game theory, and for example efficiency of potential reduction
theorems rely on a local comparison. We distinguish between three levels of
game comparison; superordinate (global), basic (semi-constructive) and
subordinate (local) comparison. In proofs, a sometimes tedious challenge faces

  We begin by investigating the notion of uniform universality, first proposed
by Montalb\'an, Reimann and Slaman. This notion is a strengthened form of a
countable Borel equivalence relation being universal, which we conjecture is
equivalent to the usual notion. With this additional uniformity hypothesis, we
can answer many questions concerning how countable groups, probability
measures, the subset relation, and increasing unions interact with
universality. For many natural classes of countable Borel equivalence
relations, we can also classify exactly which are uniformly universal.
  We also show the existence of refinements of Martin's ultrafilter on Turing
invariant Borel sets to the invariant Borel sets of equivalence relations that
are much finer than Turing equivalence. For example, we construct such an
ultrafilter for the orbit equivalence relation of the shift action of the free
group on countably many generators. These ultrafilters imply a number of
structural properties for these equivalence relations.

achieve a base level of robustness during testing. Specifically, training with
weight projections other than quantization also works, as does simply clipping
the weights, both of which have never been reported before. We confirm our

between mosquitoes and birds, and the free boundary is introduced to model and
explore the expanding front of the infective region. The spatial-temporal risk
index $R_0^F(t)$, which involves time and characters of the region, is defined
for the simplified model with the free boundary to compare with other related
threshold values, including the usual basic reproduction number $R_0$.
Sufficient conditions for the virus to vanish or spread are given. Our results
suggest that the virus will be in a scenario of vanishing if $R_0\leq 1$, and
the virus will spread to the whole region if $R_{0}^F(t_0)\geq 1$ for some
$t_0\geq 0$, while if $R^F_0(0)<1<R_0$, the spreading or vanishing of the virus
depends on the initial numbers of infected mosquitoes and birds, the area of
the infected region and diffusion rates. Moreover, some remarks on the basic
reproduction numbers and the spreading speed are presented and compared.

discussed in quantum field theories because of mixing between rotational
symmetry and internal symmetry (a.k.a topological twist). Such deformations may
be relevant, and if the subsequent renormalization group flow leads to a
non-trivial fixed point, it generically gives rise to a scale invariant
Euclidean field theory without conformal invariance. Motivated by an ansatz
studied in cosmological models some time ago, we develop a holographic dual
description of such renormalization group flows in the context of AdS/CFT. We
argue that the non-trivial fixed points require fine-tuning of the bulk theory
in general, but remarkably we find that the $O(3)$ Yang-Mills theory coupled
with the four-dimensional Einstein gravity in the minimal manner supports such
a background with the Euclidean AdS metric.

we present a web of dualities in $2+1$ dimensions that generalize the known
particle/vortex duality. Some of the dualities relate theories of fermions to
theories of bosons. Others relate different theories of fermions. For example,
the long distance behavior of the $2+1$-dimensional analog of QED with a single
Dirac fermion (a theory known as $U(1)_{1/2}$) is identified with the $O(2)$
Wilson-Fisher fixed point. The gauged version of that fixed point with a
Chern-Simons coupling at level one is identified as a free Dirac fermion. The
latter theory also has a dual version as a fermion interacting with some gauge
fields. Assuming some of these dualities, other dualities can be derived. Our
analysis resolves a number of confusing issues in the literature including how
time reversal is realized in these theories. It also has many applications in
condensed matter physics like the theory of topological insulators (and their
gapped boundary states) and the problem of electrons in the lowest Landau level
at half filling. (Our techniques also clarify some points in the fractional
Hall effect and its description using flux attachment.) In addition to
presenting several consistency checks, we also present plausible (but not
rigorous) derivations of the dualities and relate them to $3+1$-dimensional
$S$-duality.

mesoscopic superconducting island with a finite charging energy. Each end of
the nanowire is coupled to one lead via a quantum dot with resonant levels.
With a floating superconducting island, the devices shows a negative
differential conductance and giant super-Poissonian shot noise, due to the
interplay between the nonlocality of the MBSs and dynamical Coulomb blockade
effect. When the island is strongly coupled to a bulk superconductor, the
current cross correlations at small lead chemical potentials are negative by
tuning the dot energy levels. In contrast, the cross correlation is always
positive in a non-Majorana setup. This difference may provide a signature for
the existence of the MBSs.

level that can scale to IoT storage and processing requirements. However, there

low latency, and delay caused by transferring data to the cloud and then back
to the application can seriously impact their performances. To overcome this
limitation, Fog computing paradigm has been proposed, where cloud services are
extended to the edge of the network to decrease the latency and network
congestion. To realize the full potential of Fog and IoT paradigms for
real-time analytics, several challenges need to be addressed. The first and

this end, we employ a deep neural network with DAG topology to learn patterns
of change from image-level labeled training data. On top of the initial CNN
activations, we define a CRF model to incorporate the local differences and
context with the dense connections between individual pixels. We apply a
constrained mean-field algorithm to estimate the pixel-level labels, and use
the estimated labels to update the parameters of the CNN in an iterative EM
framework. This enables imposing global constraints on the observed foreground
probability mass function. Our evaluations on four benchmark datasets
demonstrate superior detection and localization performance.

Co$_3$V$_2$O$_8$, that is, the thermal conductivity ($\kappa$) can be changed
with magnetic field in an extremely large scale. Due to successive magnetic
phase transitions at 12--6 K, the zero-field $\kappa(T)$ displays a deep
minimum at 6.7 K and rather small magnitude at low temperatures. Both the
temperature and field dependencies of $\kappa$ demonstrate that the phonons are
strongly scattered at the regime of magnetic phase transitions. Magnetic field
can suppress magnetic scattering effect and significantly recover the phonon
thermal conductivity. In particular, a 14 T field along the $a$ axis increases
the $\kappa$ at 7.5 K up to 100 times. For $H \parallel c$, the magnitude of
$\kappa$ can be suppressed down to $\sim$ 8% at some field-induced transition

that it is possible to design a kind of heat switch in the family of magnetic

  models via convex optimization","27 pages, 1 figure",,,,"stat.ME","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Nonparametric maximum likelihood (NPML) for mixture models is a technique for
estimating mixing distributions that has a long and rich history in statistics
going back to the 1950s, and is closely related to empirical Bayes methods.
Historically, NPML-based methods have been considered to be relatively
impractical because of computational and theoretical obstacles. However, recent
work focusing on approximate NPML methods suggests that these methods may have
great promise for a variety of modern applications. Building on this recent
work, a class of flexible, scalable, and easy to implement approximate NPML
methods is studied for problems with multivariate mixing distributions.
Concrete guidance on implementing these methods is provided, with theoretical
and empirical support; topics covered include identifying the support set of
the mixing distribution, and comparing algorithms (across a variety of metrics)
for solving the simple convex optimization problem at the core of the
approximate NPML problem. Additionally, three diverse real data applications
are studied to illustrate the methods' performance: (i) A baseball data
analysis (a classical example for empirical Bayes methods), (ii)
high-dimensional microarray classification, and (iii) online prediction of
blood-glucose density for diabetes patients. Among other things, the empirical
results demonstrate the relative effectiveness of using multivariate (as
opposed to univariate) mixing distributions for NPML-based approaches.

and Amazon, to achieve high performance for write-intensive workloads. However,
in LSM-tree, random key-value queries can experience long latency and low
throughput due to the interference from the compaction, a basic operation in
the algorithm, to caching. LSM-tree relies on frequent compaction operations to
merge data into a sorted structure. After a compaction, the original data are
reorganized and written to other locations on the disk. As a result, the cached
data are invalidated since their referencing addresses are changed, causing
serious performance degradations.
  We propose dLSM in order to re-enable high-speed caching during intensive
writes. dLSM is an LSM-tree with a compaction buffer on the disk, working as a
cushion to minimize the cache invalidation caused by compactions. The
compaction buffer maintains a series of snapshots of the frequently compacted
data, which represent a consistent view of the corresponding data in the
underlying LSM-tree. Being updated in a much lower rate than that of
compactions, data in the compaction buffer are almost stationary. In dLSM, an
object is referenced by the disk address of the corresponding block either in
the compaction buffer for frequently compacted data, or in the underlying
LSM-tree for infrequently compacted data. Thus, hot objects can be effectively
kept in the cache without harmful invalidations. With the help of a small
on-disk compaction buffer, dLSM achieves a high query performance by enabling
effective caching, while retaining all merits of LSM-tree for write-intensive
data processing. We have implemented dLSM based on LevelDB. Our evaluations
show that with a standard DRAM cache, dLSM can achieve 5--8x performance
improvement over LSM with the same cache on HDD storage.

through models of radiative transfer in a spherical, clumpy ISM. Extinction
properties for MW, LMC, and SMC dust types are considered. It is illustrated
that the attenuation curves are primarily determined by the wavelength
dependence of absorption rather than by the underlying extinction
(absorption+scattering) curve. Attenuation curves consistent with the ""Calzetti
attenuation curve"" are found by assuming the silicate-carbonaceous dust model
for the MW, but with the 2175A absorption bump suppressed or absent. The
discrepancy between our results and previous work that claimed the SMC-type
dust to be the most likely origin of the Calzetti curve is ascribed to the
difference in adopted albedos; this study uses the theoretically calculated
albedos whereas the previous ones adopted empirically derived albedos from
observations of reflection nebulae. It is also found that the model attenuation
curves calculated with the MW dust are well represented by a modified Calzetti
curve with a varying slope and UV bump strength. The strong correlation between
the slope and UV bump strength, with steeper curves having stronger bumps, as
found in star-forming galaxies at 0.5<z<2.0, is well reproduced by our models
if the abundance of the UV bump carriers or PAHs is assumed to be 30% or 40% of
that of the MW-dust. The trend is explained by radiative transfer effects which
lead to shallower attenuation curves with weaker UV bumps as the ISM is more

challenging problem, owing mostly to the complex and dexterous nature of hand

via a Hough transform based approach coupled with a discriminatively learned

from the Hough transform. In this framework, local parts vote collectively for
the start $\&$ end positions of each action over time. We also construct an
in-house annotated dataset of 300 long videos, containing 3,177 single-action

effectively mitigate the user unfairness problem in WPCNs, where a user may
suffer from very low data rate due to the poor energy harvesting performance

Warm Dark Matter (WDM) contain spurious or unphysical haloes, most readily

that spurious haloes are a feature of traditional N-body simulations of
cosmological structure formation models, including WDM and Cold Dark Matter
(CDM) models, in which gravitational collapse proceeds in an initially
anisotropic fashion, and arises naturally as a consequence of
discreteness-driven relaxation. We demonstrate this using controlled N-body
simulations of plane-symmetric collapse and show that spurious haloes are
seeded at shell crossing by localised velocity perturbations induced by the
discrete nature of the density field, and that their characteristic separation
should be approximately the mean inter-particle separation of the N-body
simulation, which is fixed by the mass resolution within the volume. Using
cosmological N-body simulations in which particles are split into two
collisionless components of fixed mass ratio, we find that the spatial
distribution of the two components show signatures of discreteness-driven
relaxation in their spatial distribution on both large and small scales.
Adopting a spline kernel gravitational softening that is of order the comoving
mean inter-particle separation helps to suppress the effect of
discreteness-driven relaxation, but cannot eliminate it completely. These
results provide further motivation for recent developments of new algorithms,
which include, for example, revisions of the traditional N-body approach by
means of spatially adaptive anistropric gravitational softenings or explicit

of quantization, which are typically inconspicuous in low display resolution
environments, are clearly visible on HD and UHD video data and VDUs. The
default QM technique in HEVC does not take into account the video data

required to reduce unwanted video compression artifacts. Based on this fact, we

zeta-functions, as well as to several closely related results. The notes
concerning Ser's and Hasse's representations are given as theorems, while the
related expansions are given either as separate theorems or as formulae inside
the remarks and corollaries. In the first theorem, we show that the famous
Hasse's series for the zeta-function, obtained in 1930 and named after the
German mathematician Helmut Hasse, is equivalent to an earlier expression given
by a little-known French mathematician Joseph Ser in 1926. In the second
theorem, we derive a similar series representation for the zeta-function
involving the Cauchy numbers of the second kind. In the third theorem, with the
aid of some special polynomials, we generalize the previous results to the
Hurwitz zeta-function. In the fourth theorem, we obtain a similar series with
Gregory's coefficients of higher order. In the fifth theorem, we extend the
results of the third theorem to a class of Dirichlet series. As a consequence,
we obtain several globally convergent series for the zeta-functions. We also
show that Hasse's series may be obtained much more easily by using the theory
of finite differences, and we demonstrate that there exist numerous series of
the same nature. In the sixth theorem, we show that Hasse's series is a simple
particular case of a more general class of series involving the Stirling
numbers of the first kind. All the expansions derived in the paper lead, in
turn, to the series expansions for the Stieltjes constants, including new
series with rational terms for Euler's constant, for the logarithm of the
gamma-function, for the digamma and trigamma functions. Finally, in the

data from heterogeneous populations. Maximum likelihood estimation of the
parameters is typically carried out via the Expectation-Maximization (EM)
algorithm. The complexity of the implementation of the algorithm depends on the
parametric distribution that is adopted as the component densities of the
mixture model. In the case of the skew normal and skew t-distributions, for
example, the E-step would involve complicated expressions that are
computationally expensive to evaluate. This can become quite time-consuming for
large and/or high-dimensional datasets. In this paper, we develop a
multithreaded version of the EM algorithm for the fitting of finite mixture
models. Due to the structure of the algorithm for these models, the E- and
M-steps can be easily reformulated to be executed in parallel across multiple
threads to take advantage of the processing power available in modern-day
multicore machines. Our approach is simple and easy to implement, requiring
only small changes to standard code. To illustrate the approach, we focus on a
fairly general mixture model that includes as special or limiting cases some of
the most commonly used mixture models including the normal, t-, skew normal,

Identifying lens binarity is generally easy especially in events characterized
by caustic crossing since the resulting light curve exhibits strong deviations
from smooth single-lensing light curve. On the contrary, light curves with
minor deviations from a Paczy\'nski behaviour do not allow one to identify the
source binarity. A consequence of the gravitational microlensing is the shift
of the position of the multiple image centroid with respect to the source star
location - the so called astrometric microlensing signal. When the astrometric
signal is considered, the presence of a binary source manifests with a path
that largely differs from that expected for single-source events. Here, we
investigate the astrometric signatures of binary sources taking into account
their orbital motion and the parallax effect due to the Earth motion, which
turn out not to be negligible in most cases. We also show that considering the
above-mentioned effects is important in the analysis of astrometric data in
order to correctly estimate the lens-event parameters.

astrophysical phenomena ranging from the intergalactic to the stellar scales.
In studying them, numerical simulations are nearly inescapable, due to the
large degree of nonlinearity involved. However the dynamical ranges of these
phenomena are much larger than what is computationally accessible. In large
eddy simulations (LES), the resulting limited resolution effects are addressed
explicitly by introducing to the equations of motion additional terms
associated with the unresolved, subgrid-scale (SGS) dynamics. This renders the
system unclosed. We derive a set of nonlinear structural closures for the ideal
MHD LES equations with particular emphasis on the effects of compressibility.
The closures are based on a gradient expansion of the finite-resolution
operator (W.K. Yeo CUP 1993, ed. Galperin & Orszag) and require no assumptions
about the nature of the flow or magnetic field. Thus the scope of their
applicability ranges from the sub- to the hyper-sonic and -Alfvenic regimes.
The closures support spectral energy cascades both up and down-scale, as well
as direct transfer between kinetic and magnetic resolved and unresolved energy
budgets. They implicitly take into account the local geometry, and in
particular the anisotropy, of the flow. Their properties are $\textit{a
priori}$ validated in an accompanying article (Grete et al. Phys. Plasmas,
2016) against alternative closures available in the literature with respect to

such phenomena as heat conductivity downturn, anomalous Lorentz ratio,
nonlinear entropy, insulating ground state, nematicity- and stripe-phases and
Fermi pockets, reveals the nonconventional dielectric property of the
pseudogap-normal phase. Since conventional superconductivity appears from a
conducting normal phase, the understanding of how superconductivity arises from
an insulating state becomes a fundamental problem and thus the keystone for all
of cuprate physics. Recently, in interpreting the physics of visualization in
scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) real space nanoregions (NRs), which exhibit
an energy gap, we have succeeded in understanding that the minimum size for
these NRs provides pseudogap and superconductivity pairs, which are single

The focus is on the behavior of the longitudinal resistivity with rising

point, $T = T_m$ between ferro- and antiferromagnetic phases. A detailed
electronic structure investigation for $T \geq 0$ K explains this feature and
demonstrates the important role of (i) the difference of the electronic
structure at the Fermi level between the two magnetically ordered states and
(ii) the different degree of thermally induced magnetic disorder in the

support these conclusions, we also describe the temperature dependence of the
spin-orbit induced anomalous Hall resistivity and Gilbert damping parameter.
For the various response quantities considered the impact of thermal lattice
vibrations and spin fluctuations on their temperature dependence is
investigated in detail. Comparison with corresponding experimental data finds

derivation of the Boltzmann hierarchy, correcting a mistake in previous

lifetime-- on the CMB and matter power spectra. From CMB only, we obtain that
no more than 3.8 % of the DM could have decayed in the time between
recombination and today (all bounds quoted at 95 % CL). We also comment on the
important application of this bound to the case where primordial black holes
constitute DM, a scenario notoriously difficult to constrain. For lifetimes
longer than the age of the Universe, the bounds can be cast as $f\Gamma <
6.3\times10^{-3}$ Gyr$^{-1}$. For the first time, we also checked that
degeneracies with massive neutrinos are broken when information from the large
scale structure is used. Even secondary effects like CMB lensing suffice to
this purpose. Decaying DM models have been invoked to solve a possible tension
between low redshift astronomical measurements of $\sigma_8$ and $\Omega_{\rm
m}$ and the ones inferred by Planck. We reassess this claim finding that with
the most recent BAO, HST and $\sigma_8$ data extracted from the CFHT survey,
the tension is only slightly reduced despite the two additional free
parameters, loosening the bound to $f\Gamma < 15.9\times10^{-3}$ Gyr$^{-1}$.
The bound however improves to $f\Gamma < 5.9\times10^{-3}$ Gyr$^{-1}$ if only
data consistent with the CMB are included. This highlights the importance of
establishing whether the tension is due to real physical effects or unaccounted
systematics, for settling the reach of achievable constraints on decaying DM.

small-volume effect enables robust, sensitive and efficient information
transfer in the spine volume, but not in the cell volume. In the spine volume,
intrinsic noise in reactions becomes larger than extrinsic noise of input,
making robust information transfer against input fluctuation. Stochastic
facilitation of Ca$^{2+}$ increase occurs in the spine volume, making higher
sensitivity to lower intensity of input. Volume-dependency of information
transfer enables efficient information transfer per input in the spine volume.

topological properties of such thin films of 3D topological systems, making
also a comparative study of CI- vs. TI-type models belonging to different
symmetry classes in this respect. Through this comparative study we suggest
that WSM is to CI as STI is to WTI. Finally, to test the robustness of our

numerically the two-terminal conductance of the system using transfer matrix

with non-Euclidean state spaces, non-linear observations and high dimensions

we use a generalized Charbonnier energy function in this framework rather than
a quadratic energy function as proposed in related work. Experiments confirm
that our method enables accurate reconstructions on-par with state-of-the-art.

models facilitate estimation of transition probabilities by tracking species
occupancy at many fixed observation points over multiple periods of time.
Estimation of transition probabilities of sessile communities seems easy in
principle but may still be difficult in practice because resampling error
(i.e., a failure to resample exactly the same location at fixed points) may
cause significant estimation bias. Previous studies have developed novel
analytical methods to correct for this estimation bias. However, they did not
consider the local structure of community composition induced by the aggregated
distribution of organisms that is typically observed in sessile assemblages and
is very likely to affect observations. In this study, we developed a multistate
dynamic site occupancy model to estimate transition probabilities that accounts
for resampling errors associated with local community structure. The model
applies a nonparametric multivariate kernel smoothing methodology to the latent
occupancy component to estimate the local state composition near each
observation point, which is assumed to determine the probability distribution
of data conditional on the occurrence of resampling error. By using computer
simulations, we confirmed that an observation process that depends on local
community structure may bias inferences about transition probabilities. By
applying the proposed model to a real dataset of intertidal sessile
communities, we also showed that estimates of transition probabilities and of
the properties of community dynamics may differ considerably when spatial
dependence is taken into account. Our approach can even accommodate an
anisotropic spatial correlation of species composition, and may serve as a
basis for inferring complex nonlinear ecological dynamics.

less than 3.10$^{-8}$ (this number is comparable with that in lasers) along

Hierarchical self-assembly overcomes shortcomings of ""top-down"" methods by
significantly reducing fabrication time and making it possible to form bulk
materials. Here we report an application of hierarchical self-assembly of metal
nanoparticles for the creation of the first isotropic optical metamaterial with
strong artificial magnetism in blue light. We have used colloidal self-assembly
to create artificial ""nanomolecules"" that generate the desired magnetic
response and microfluidic self-assembly to produce a bulk metastructure. We
demonstrate that the magnetic response of the final material is accurately
described by an isotropic magnetic permeability that satisfies the principle of
locality. Our approach unlocks the fabrication of large volumes of composite
nanomaterials. Moreover, the spatial disorder inherent to this ""bottom-up""
method holds the key to solving the non-locality problem. The technique can be
readily extended to the future generations of low-loss optical metamaterials
made of dielectric nano-blocks to bypass the limitations of optical losses
associated with plasmonic resonances in noble metals.

the patients and hence cannot easily be anonymised. Differential privacy has
emerged as a potentially promising solution: privacy is considered sufficient
if presence of individual patients cannot be distinguished. However,

performance is achieved by limiting the sharing of private information by
decreasing the dimensionality and by projecting outliers to fit tighter bounds,
therefore needing to add less noise for equal privacy. As already the
simple-to-implement method shows promise on the challenging genomic data, we
anticipate rapid progress towards practical applications in many fields, such

it is important for the robot to predict how a human will move when performing
a task. While predicting human motion for tasks not known a priori is very
challenging, we argue that single-arm reaching motions for known tasks in
collaborative settings (which are especially relevant for manufacturing) are
indeed predictable. Two hypotheses underlie our approach for predicting such
motions: First, that the trajectory the human performs is optimal with respect
to an unknown cost function, and second, that human adaptation to their
partner's motion can be captured well through iterative re-planning with the
above cost function. The key to our approach is thus to learn a cost function
which ""explains"" the motion of the human. To do this, we gather example
trajectories from pairs of participants performing a collaborative assembly
task using motion capture. We then use Inverse Optimal Control to learn a cost
function from these trajectories. Finally, we predict reaching motions from the
human's current configuration to a task-space goal region by iteratively
re-planning a trajectory using the learned cost function. Our planning
algorithm is based on the trajectory optimizer STOMP, it plans for a 23 DoF
human kinematic model and accounts for the presence of a moving collaborator
and obstacles in the environment. Our results suggest that in most cases, our
method outperforms baseline methods when predicting motions. We also show that
our method outperforms baselines for predicting human motion when a human and a
robot share the workspace.

the Coriolis force. When the fluid is incompressible, inviscid and contained in
a rigid container, these modes satisfy Poincar\'e's equation that has the
peculiarity of being hyperbolic with boundary conditions. Inertial modes are
therefore solutions of an ill-posed boundary-value problem. In this paper we
investigate the mathematical side of this problem. We first show that the
Poincar\'e problem can be formulated in the Hilbert space of square-integrable
functions, with no hypothesis on the continuity or the differentiability of
velocity fields. We observe that with this formulation, the Poincar\'e operator
is bounded and self-adjoint and as such, its spectrum is the union of the point
spectrum (the set of eigenvalues) and the continuous spectrum only. When the
fluid volume is an ellipsoid, we show that the inertial modes form a complete
base of polynomial velocity fields for the square-integrable velocity fields
defined over the ellipsoid and meeting the boundary conditions. If the
ellipsoid is axisymmetric then the base can be identified with the set of
Poincar\'e modes, first obtained by Bryan (1889), and completed with the
geostrophic modes.

of seismic and non-seismic inputs. When introducing a correction to the Delta
nu scaling relation as suggested by stellar models, for RGB stars we find
excellent agreement with the expected masses from isochrone fitting, and with a
distance modulus derived using independent methods. The offset with respect to
independent masses is lower, or comparable with, the uncertainties on the
average RGB mass (4-10%, depending on the combination of constraints used). Our
results lend confidence to asteroseismic masses in the metal poor regime. We
note that a larger sample will be needed to allow more stringent tests to be
made of systematic uncertainties in all the observables (both seismic and
non-seismic), and to explore the properties of RHB stars, and of different

extend to which software artifacts can be reused during application
development, (3) expressiveness: the characteristics of IoT applications that
can be modeled using our approach, (4) memory metrics: the amount of memory and

known for 30 years. However, the relative importance of the different
contributions to the observed variations is not yet fully understood. Our goal
is to estimate the relative contribution from sunspots to the observed
activity-related variations in the frequencies of the acoustic modes. We use a
variational principle to relate the phase differences induced by sunspots on
the acoustic waves to the corresponding changes in the frequencies of the
global acoustic oscillations. From the sunspot properties (area and latitude as
a function of time), we are able to estimate the spot-induced frequency shifts.
These are then combined with a smooth frequency shift component, associated
with long-term solar-cycle variations, and the results compared with the
frequency shifts derived from the Global Oscillation Network Group (GONG) data.
The result of this comparison is consistent with a sunspot contribution to the
observed frequency shifts of roughly 30 per cent, with the remaining 70 per
cent resulting mostly from a global, non-stochastic variation, possibly related
to the changes in the overall magnetic field. Moreover, analysis of the
residuals obtained after the subtraction of the model frequency shifts from the
observations indicates the presence of a 1.5-yr periodicity in the data in

forth between two vertices. We then connect it to the power dissipation of a

oscillating states, called uniform states and flip states, and that the
projection of an arbitrary state onto a flip state is bounded by the power
dissipation of an electric circuit. By applying this framework to states along
a single edge of a graph, we show that low effective resistance implies
oscillatory localization of the quantum walk. This reveals that oscillatory
localization occurs on a large variety of regular graphs, including
edge-transitive, expander, and high degree graphs. As a corollary, high

localization, where the walker alternates between two states. The walk is given
by the flip-flop shift, which is easily defined on non-lattice graphs, and the
Grover coin. Extremely simple examples of the localization exist, such as a
walker jumping back and forth between two vertices of the complete graph. We
show that only two kinds of states, called flip states and uniform states,
exhibit exact oscillatory localization. So the projection of an arbitrary state
onto these gives a lower bound on the extent of oscillatory localization. Thus
we completely characterize the states that oscillate under the quantum walk.

adopt structures that involve an acidic proton shared between the carboxy and
amino function. Dipeptides adopt one of two intramolecular-hydrogen bonded

cation, the accessible conformational space shrinks and intramolecular hydrogen
bonding is prevented due to strong electrostatic interaction of backbone and
side chain functional groups with cations. Clear correlations emerge from the
binding energies of the six divalent ions with amino acids and dipeptides.
Cd$^{2+}$ and Hg$^{2+}$ show the largest binding energies - a potential
correlation with their known high acute toxicities. Ca$^{2+}$ and Pb$^{2+}$
reveal almost identical binding energies across the entire series of amino

numerical procedure is introduced to compute fluxes in scalar conservation
equations in such a way that their total integrated magnitude is minimised. The

to describe the unification of late and early-time acceleration eras with the
radiation and matter domination era. The Hubble rate of the unified evolution
contains two mild singularities, so called Type IV singularities, and the
evolution itself has some appealing features, such as the existence of a
deceleration-acceleration transition at late times. We also address
quantitatively a fundamental question related to modified gravity models
description of cosmological evolution: Is it possible for all modified gravity
descriptions of our Universe evolution, to produce a nearly scale invariant
spectrum of primordial curvature perturbations? As we demonstrate, the answer
for the $F(G)$ description is no, since the resulting power spectrum is not
scale invariant, in contrast to the $F(R)$ description studied in the
literature. Therefore, although the cosmological evolution can be realized in
the context of vacuum $F(G)$ gravity, the evolution is not compatible with the
observational data, in contrast to the $F(R)$ gravity description of the same
cosmological evolution.

that the fundamental limit of $T^{2}$ time scaling of quantum Fisher

two signaling pathways concurrently, vascular endothelial growth factor A
(VEGFA) and Notch-Delta. Extracellular VEGFA activates the intracellular
Notch-Delta pathway in nearby endothelial cells which results in endothelial
(stalk, tip) differentiation. Retinal astrocytes appear to play a crucial role
in polarizing new sprouts by secreting VEGFA. \emph{In vivo} retinal
angiogenesis experiments in neonatal mouse generated quantitative data on daily
cell counts and morphological data of vascular network expanding over
fibronectin-rich matrix. Based on this set of data and other existing ones, we
developed a cell-based, multiscale mathematical model using the cellular Potts
model framework to investigate the sprout evolution by integrating the VEGFA
and Notch-Delta signaling pathways. The model incorporates three levels of
description: intracellular, intercellular, and extracellular. Starting with a
single astrocyte embedded in a fibronectin-rich matrix, we use the model to
assess different scenarios regarding VEGFA levels and its interaction with
matrix proteins. Simulation results suggest that astrocyte-derived VEGFA
gradients along with heterogeneous ECM reproduces sprouting morphology, and the
extension speed is in agreement with experimental data in 7 days postnatal
mouse retina. Results also reproduce empirical observations in sprouting
angiogenesis, including anastomosis, dynamic tip cell competition, and sprout
regression as a result of Notch blockade.

  brain images",,,,,"stat.AP","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Motivated by increasing trends of relating brain images to a clinical outcome
of interest, we propose a functional domain selection (FuDoS) method that
effectively selects subregions of the brain associated with the outcome. View
each individual's brain as a 3D functional object, the statistical aim is to
distinguish the region where a regression coefficient $\beta(t)=0$ from
$\beta(t)\neq0$, where $t$ denotes spatial location. FuDoS is composed of two
stages of estimation. We first segment the brain into several small parts based
on the correlation structure. Then, potential subsets are built using the
obtained segments and their predictive performance are evaluated to select the
best subset, augmented by a stability selection criterion. We conduct extensive
simulations both for 1D and 3D functional data, and evaluate its effectiveness
in selecting the true subregion. We also investigate predictive ability of the
selected stable regions. To find the brain regions related to cognitive
ability, FuDoS is applied to the ADNI's PET data. Due to the induced
sparseness, the results naturally provide more interpretable information about
the relations between the regions and the outcome. Moreover, the selected
regions from our analysis show high associations with the expected anatomical
brain areas known to have memory-related functions.

motor exhibits distinct states of motility: active motion along filaments, and

performs passive diffusion in the vicinity of the detachment point due to
cytoplasmic crowding. The transition rates between motion and pause phases are
asymmetric in general, and considerably affected by changes in environmental

real-time 3D shape measurement method without changing camera exposures. Three
inverted phase-shifted fringe patterns are used to complement three regular
phase-shifted fringe patterns for phase retrieval when any of the regular
fringe patterns are saturated. But Jiang's method still has some drawbacks: (1)
The phases in saturated pixels are respectively estimated by different formulas
for different cases. It is shortage of an universal formula; (2) it cannot be
extended to four-step phase-shifting algorithm because inverted fringe patterns
are the repetition of regular fringe patterns; (3) only three unsaturated
intensity values at every pixel of fringe patterns are chosen for phase
demodulation, lying idle the other unsaturated ones. We proposed a method for
enhanced high dynamic range 3D shape measurement based on generalized
phase-shifting algorithm, which combines the complementary technique of
inverted and regular fringe patterns with generalized phase-shifting algorithm.
Firstly, two sets of complementary phase-shifted fringe patterns, namely
regular and inverted fringe patterns are projected and collected. Then all
unsaturated intensity values at the same camera pixel from two sets of fringe
patterns are selected, and employed to retrieve the phase by generalized

prove the validity of the proposed method. The results are analyzed and

additional neutrons are produced and the chain reaction propagates until it is

fission waves are soliton-like and self stabilizing. However, we show that in
uranium, coupling of the neutron field to the 239U->239Np->239Pu decay chain

compromised by strong irregularities causing severe phase scintillation
($\mathit{\sigma }_{\phi }$ > 1) in the nightside high-latitude ionosphere
during a substorm on 3 November 2013. Substorm onset and a later
intensification coincided with polar cap patches entering the auroral oval to
become auroral blobs. Using Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS)
receivers and optical data, we show severe scintillation driven by intense
auroral emissions in the line of sight between the receiver and the satellites.
During substorm expansion, the area of scintillation followed the intense
poleward edge of the auroral oval. The intense auroral emissions were colocated
with polar cap patches (blobs). The patches did not contain strong
irregularities, neither before entering the auroral oval nor after the aurora
had faded. Signals from all three GNSS constellations were similarly affected
by the irregularities. Furthermore, two receivers spaced around 120km apart
reported highly different scintillation impacts, with strong scintillation on
half of the satellites in one receiver and no scintillation in the other. This
shows that areas of severe irregularities in the nightside ionosphere can be
highly localized. Amplitude scintillations were low throughout the entire
interval.

Station (magnetic latitude $76.24\,^{\circ}{\rm C}$N) at Ny-Alesund, Svalbard,
we performed the first extensive survey for the dayside diffuse auroras (DDAs)
and acquired observational results as follows. (1) The DDAs can be classified
into two broad categories, i.e., unstructured and structured DDAs. The
unstructured DDAs are mainly distributed in the morning and afternoon, but the
structured DDAs predominantly occurred around the magnetic local noon (MLN).
(2) The unstructured DDAs observed in morning and afternoon present obviously
different properties. The afternoon ones are much stable and seldom show
pulsating property. (3) The DDAs are more easily observed under geomagnetically
quiet times. (4) The structured DDAsmainly show patchy, stripy, and irregular
forms and are often pulsating and drifting. The drifting directions are mostly
westward (with speed $\sim$5km/s), but there are cases showing eastward or
poleward drifting. (5) The stripy DDAs are exclusively observed near theMLN
and,most importantly, their alignments are confirmed to be consistent with the
direction of ionospheric convection near the MLN. (6) A new auroral form,
called throat aurora, is found to be developed from the stripy DDAs. Based on
the observational results and previous studies, we proposed our explanations to
the DDAs. We suggest that the unstructured DDAs observed in the morning are
extensions of the nightside diffuse aurora to the dayside, but that observed in
the afternoon are predominantly caused by proton precipitations.

moving auroral forms (PMAFs) are causing significant phase scintillation in
signals from navigation satellites. The data were obtained using a combination
of ground-based optical instruments and a newly installed multiconstellation
navigation signal receiver at Longyearbyen. Both events affected signals from
GPS and Global Navigation Satellite System (GLONASS). When one intense PMAF
appeared, the signal from one GPS spacecraft also experienced a temporary loss
of signal lock. Although several polar cap patches were also observed in the
area as enhancements in total electron content, the most severe scintillation
and loss of signal lock appear to be attributed to very intense PMAF activity.
This shows that PMAFs are locations of strong ionospheric irregularities, which
at times may cause more severe disturbances in the cusp ionosphere for
navigation signals than polar cap patches.

obtained from the full available set of ground-based magnetometer observations

correlation between the vector magnetometer time series from pairs of stations
within a running time window exceeds a threshold. Dimensionless parameters can
then be obtained that characterize the network and by extension, the
spatiotemporal dynamics of the substorm under observation. We analyze four
isolated substorm test cases as well as a steady magnetic convection (SMC)
event and a day in which no substorms occur. These test case substorms are
found to give a consistent characteristic network response at onset in terms of
their spatial correlation. Such responses are differentiable from responses to
the SMC event and nonsubstorm times. We present a method to optimize network
parametrization with respect to the different individual station responses, the
spatial inhomogeneity of stations in the Northern Hemisphere, and the choice of
correlation window sizes. Our results suggest that dynamical network analysis

second one is a dispersed, longer-timescale injection pulse accompanied by a

We present a case of polar cap patch formation where a reconnection-driven

plasma but where particle impact ionization in the cusp dominates the initial
plasma structuring. In the cusp, density features are observed which are twice
as dense as the solar-ionized background. These features then follow the polar
cap convection and become less structured and lower in amplitude. These are the
first in situ observations tracking polar cap patch evolution from creation by
plasma transport and enhancement by cusp precipitation, through entrainment in
the polar cap flow and relaxation into smooth patches as they approach the

statistic arising from each such optimization. This likelihood is a
first-hitting time distribution in the exponential class. Particular constraint
sets are identified that, from an optimal inference perspective, justify
earlier neurocomputational models. Interactions between constraints, mediated
through the inferred likelihood, restrict constraint-set parameterizations,
e.g., the energy-budget limits estimation performance which, in turn, matches
an axonal communication constraint. Such linkages are, for biologists,
experimental predictions of the method. In addition to the related likelihood,
at least one type of constraint set implies marginal distributions, and in this
case, a Shannon bits/joule statement arises.

exponential distribution of poles along the negative-real axis of the s plane,

the array of zeros relative to the array of poles, where each array maintains
periodic spacing on a log scale. The nature of the slope approximation is close
to Chebyshev optimal in the interior of the pole-zero array, approaching
conjectured Chebyshev optimality over all frequencies in the limit as the order
approaches infinity. Practical designs can arbitrarily approach the
