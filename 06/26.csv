corrections reveal an $\Omega$ -deformed spacetime structure,
$\Omega:=1-2\rho/\rho_c$, where $\Omega<0$ indicates a Euclidean-like space and
$\Omega>0$ indicates a Lorentz-like space. It would be reasonable to give the
initial value at the spacetime transition point, $\rho=\rho_c/2$, but we find
that it is impossible to define a Minkowski-like vacuum even for large $k$
modes at that time. However, if we loosen the condition and give the initial
value slightly after $\Omega=0$, e.g., $\Omega\simeq 0.2$, the vacuum state can
be well defined and, furthermore the slow roll approximation also works well in
that region. Both scalar and tensor spectra are considered in the framework of
loop quantum cosmology with holonomy corrections. We find that if the energy
density is not too small in relation to $\rho_c/2$ when the considered $k$ mode
crossing the horizon, effective theory can give a much smaller scalar power
spectrum than classical theory and the spectrum of tensor perturbations could
blueshift. But when compared to other observations, since the energy densities
when the modes crossed the horizon were significantly smaller than $\rho_c$,the
results we get agree with previous work in the literature and with the
classical inflation theory.

simultaneously, false discovery rate (FDR) control can be achieved with the
well-known Benjamini-Hochberg procedure, which adapts to the amount of signal

improve power in scenarios where the hypotheses are organized into groups or
into a hierarchy, as well as other structured settings. Here we introduce
SABHA, the ""structure-adaptive Benjamini-Hochberg algorithm"", as a
generalization of these adaptive testing methods. SABHA incorporates prior
information about any pre-determined type of structure in the pattern of
locations of the signals and nulls within the list of hypotheses, to reweight
the p-values in a data-adaptive way. This raises the power by making more
discoveries in regions where signals appear to be more common. Our main
theoretical result proves that SABHA controls FDR at a level that is at most
slightly higher than the target FDR level, as long as the adaptive weights are
constrained sufficiently so as not to overfit too much to the
data-interestingly, the excess FDR can be related to the Rademacher complexity
or Gaussian width of the class from which we choose our data-adaptive weights.
We apply this general framework to various structured settings, including
ordered, grouped, and low total variation structures, and get the bounds on FDR
for each specific setting. We also examine the empirical performance of SABHA
on fMRI activity data and on gene/drug response data, as well as on simulated

the spectroscopic results to obtain mass, radius, and luminosity. Additionally,
we used the luminosity, effective temperature, metallicity and alpha-element

radius, gravity, and age ranges for those stars. Finally, we determined new
relations between effective temperature and macroturbulence for dwarfs and
subgiants. Our analysis achieved precisions of 25 K in Teff , 0.01 dex in
[M/H], 0.028 dex for log g and 0.5 km/s in v sin ibased on multiple
observations of the same stars. The abundance results were similarly precise,
between 0.01 and - 0.04 dex, though trends with respect to Teff remained for
which we derived empirical corrections. The trends, though small, were much
larger than our uncertainties and are shared with published abundances. We show
that changing our model atmosphere grid accounts for most of the trend in [M/H]

macrorealistic inequalities for arbitrarily short temporal correlations.
Moreover, the derived inequalities are manifestly violated even in the absence
of Hamiltonian evolution, unlike for Leggett-Garg inequalities that use a
single continuous measurement. Such a violation should indicate the failure of
at least one postulate of macrorealism: either physical quantities do not have
well defined values at all times, or the measurement process itself disturbs
what is being measured. For measurements of equal strength we are able to
construct a classical stochastic model for a spin that perfectly emulates both
the qubit evolution and the observed noisy signals, thus emulating the
violations; interestingly, this model also requires an unphysical noise to
emulate the readouts, which effectively restricts the ability of an observer to
learn information about the spin.

equivalent to Bayes Theorem, also known as Bayesian updating. By definition, a
process of Bayesian Inference is one which involves a Bayesian update, so we
may conclude that these frameworks describe natural selection as a process of
Bayesian inference. Thus natural selection serves as a counter example to a
widely-held interpretation that restricts Bayesian Inference to human mental
processes (including the endeavors of statisticians). As Bayesian inference can
always be cast in terms of (variational) free energy minimization, natural
selection can be viewed as comprising two components: a generative model of an
""experiment"" in the external world environment, and the results of that
""experiment"" or the ""surprise"" entailed by predicted and actual outcomes of the
""experiment"". Minimization of free energy implies that the implicit measure of
""surprise"" experienced serves to update the generative model in a Bayesian
manner. This description closely accords with the mechanisms of generalized
Darwinian process proposed both by Dawkins, in terms of replicators and
vehicles, and Campbell, in terms of inferential systems. Bayesian inference is
an algorithm for the accumulation of evidence-based knowledge. This algorithm
is now seen to operate over a wide range of evolutionary processes, including
natural selection, the evolution of mental models and cultural evolutionary
processes, notably including science itself. The variational principle of free
energy minimization may thus serve as a unifying mathematical framework for
universal Darwinism, the study of evolutionary processes operating throughout
nature.

derived 1D density profiles are both consistent with a cut through the Herschel
PACS/SPIRE and JCMT SCUBA-2 continuum maps of L1689B and with a derived local
interstellar radiation field. Choosing an appropriate cut along the filament
major axis, we minimize the impact of the filament emission on the modeling.
For the bulk of the core (5000-20000 au) an isothermal sphere model with a
temperature of around 10 K provides the best fits. We show that the power law
index of the density profile, as well as the constant temperature can be
derived directly from the radial surface brightness profiles. For the inner
region (< 5000 au), we find a range of densities and temperatures that are
consistent with the surface brightness profiles and the local interstellar
radiation field. Based on our core models, we find that pixel-by-pixel single
temperature spectral energy distribution fits are incapable of determining
dense core properties. We conclude that, to derive physical core properties, it
is important to avoid an azimuthal average of core and filament.
Correspondingly, derived core masses are too high since they include some mass
of the filament, and might introduce errors when determining core mass
functions. The forward radiative transfer methods also avoids the loss of
information owing to smearing of all maps to the coarsest spatial resolution.
We find the central core region to be colder and denser than estimated in
recent inverse radiative transfer modeling, possibly indicating the start of
star formation in L1689B.

groups of Cepheids reported recently include four Cepheids in the Nuclear
Stellar Disk (NSD), about 200 pc around the Galactic Centre, found by Matsunaga
et al. and those spread across the inner part of the disk reported by Dekany

Cepheids towards the bulge region, some of which are common with Dekany et al.,
and discuss the large impact of the reddening correction on distance estimates
for these objects. Assuming that the four Cepheids in the NSD are located at
the distance of the Galactic Centre and that the near-infrared extinction law,
i.e. wavelength dependency of the interstellar extinction, is not
systematically different between the NSD and other bulge lines-of-sight, most
of the other Cepheids presented here are located significantly further than the
Galactic Centre. This suggests a lack of Cepheids in the inner 2.5 kpc region
of the Galactic disk except the NSD. Recent radio observations show a similar
distribution of star-forming regions.

to tackle the word sense disambiguation (WSD) task by representing words as
nodes, which are connected if they are semantically similar. Despite the
increasingly number of studies carried out with such models, most of them use
networks just to represent the data, while the pattern recognition performed on
the attribute space is performed using traditional learning techniques. In
other words, the structural relationship between words have not been explicitly
used in the pattern recognition process. In addition, only a few investigations
have probed the suitability of representations based on bipartite networks and
graphs (bigraphs) for the problem, as many approaches consider all possible
links between words. In this context, we assess the relevance of a bipartite
network model representing both feature words (i.e. the words characterizing
the context) and target (ambiguous) words to solve ambiguities in written
texts. Here, we focus on the semantical relationships between these two type of
words, disregarding the relationships between feature words. In special, the
proposed method not only serves to represent texts as graphs, but also
constructs a structure on which the discrimination of senses is accomplished.
Our results revealed that the proposed learning algorithm in such bipartite
networks provides excellent results mostly when topical features are employed
to characterize the context. Surprisingly, our method even outperformed the
support vector machine algorithm in particular cases, with the advantage of
being robust even if a small training dataset is available. Taken together, the
results obtained here show that the proposed representation/classification
method might be useful to improve the semantical characterization of written
texts.

existence of solutions representing ES state. Using dynamical system techniques
along with numerical analysis, we find two classes of solutions: the first one
is always unstable of the saddle type while the second is always stable so that
its dynamical behavior corresponds to a center equilibrium point. The
importance of the second class of solutions is due to the significant duty they
have in constructing non-singular emergent models in which the universe could
have experienced past-eternally, a series of infinite oscillations about such
an initial static state after which, it enters through a suitable physical
mechanism, to an inflationary era. Considering specific forms for the
functionality of $f(R,T)$, we show that this theory is capable of providing
cosmological solutions which admit emergent universe (EU) scenarios. We also
investigate homogeneous scalar perturbations for the mentioned models. The
stability regions of the solutions are parametrized by a linear equation of

lattice correlations have been reported. At zero magnetic field the transition

dominated by precursor phenomena, neutron scattering shows the build up of
strong chiral fluctuating correlations over the surface of a sphere with radius
$2\pi/\ell$, where $\ell$ is the pitch of the helix. It has been suggested that
these fluctuating correlations drive the helical transition to first order
following a scenario proposed by Brazovskii for liquid crystals. We present a
comprehensive neutron scattering study under magnetic fields, which provides
evidence that this is not the case. The sharp first order transition persists
for magnetic fields up to 0.4 T whereas the fluctuating correlations weaken and
start to concentrate along the field direction already above 0.2 T. Our results
thus disconnect the first order nature of the transition from the precursor
fluctuating correlations. They also show no indication for a tricritical point,
where the first order transition crosses over to second order with increasing
magnetic field. In this light, the nature of the first order helical transition
and the precursor phenomena above $T_C$, both of general relevance to chiral
magnetism, remain an open question.

n(k,rho), with the Heaviside functions, the role of n(k,rho) on the nucleon
SPEs at the major levels of the selected closed shell nuclei, is investigated.
The best fit of spin-orbit splitting is taken into account when correcting the
major levels of the nuclei by using the parameterized Wood-Saxon potential and
the AV18 density-dependent mean field potential which is constructed by the
LOCV method. Considering the point-like protons in the spherical Coulomb
potential well, the single-proton energies are corrected. The results show the

used for describing water diffusion in an organic tissue. Typically, rank-2
tensors quantify this diffusion. From this quantification, it is possible to
calculate relevant scalar measures (i.e. fractional anisotropy and mean
diffusivity) employed in clinical diagnosis of neurological diseases.
Nonetheless, 2nd-order tensors fail to represent complex tissue structures like
crossing fibers. To overcome this limitation, several researchers proposed a
diffusion representation with higher order tensors (HOT), specifically 4th and
6th orders. However, the current acquisition protocols of dMRI data allow
images with a spatial resolution between 1 $mm^3$ and 2 $mm^3$. This voxel size
is much smaller than tissue structures. Therefore, several clinical procedures
derived from dMRI may be inaccurate. Interpolation has been used to enhance
resolution of dMRI in a tensorial space. Most interpolation methods are valid
only for rank-2 tensors and a generalization for HOT data is missing. In this
work, we propose a novel stochastic process called Tucker decomposition process
(TDP) for performing HOT data interpolation. Our model is based on the Tucker
decomposition and Gaussian processes as parameters of the TDP. We test the TDP
in 2nd, 4th and 6th rank HOT fields. For rank-2 tensors, we compare against
direct interpolation, log-Euclidean approach and Generalized Wishart processes.
For rank-4 and rank-6 tensors we compare against direct interpolation. Results
obtained show that TDP interpolates accurately the HOT fields and generalizes
to any rank.

gyrotropic assumption, however, fails around a magnetically neutral region,
where the cyclotron period may get comparable to or even longer than a

this work we propose a data-driven, physics-informed machine learning approach

modern machine learning technique based on random forests, the discrepancy

Reynolds stresses discrepancies in new flows. The method is used to predict the
Reynolds stresses in the flow over periodic hills by using two training flow
scenarios of increasing difficulties: (1) the flow in the same periodic hills
geometry yet at a lower Reynolds number, and (2) the flow in a different hill
geometry with a similar recirculation zone. Excellent predictive performances
were observed in both scenarios, demonstrating the merits of the proposed
method. Improvement of RANS modeled Reynolds stresses enabled by the proposed

force-free pulsar magnetospheres with magnetic twists in closed field line
region around the polar caps. The magnetosphere with twisted closed lines leads
to enhanced spin-down rates. The enhancement in spin-down rate depends on the
size of region with twisted closed lines. Typically, it is increased by a
factor of $\sim2$, which is consistent with the intermittent pulsars' spin down
behavior during the `off' and `on' states. We find there is a threshold of
maximal twist angle $\Delta\phi_{\rm thres}\sim1$. The magnetosphere is stable
only if the closed line twist angle is less than $\Delta\phi_{\rm thres}$.
Beyond this value, the magnetosphere becomes unstable and gets untwisted. The
spin-down rate would reduce to its off-state value. The quasi-periodicity in
spin-down rate change can be explained by long-term activities in star's crust
and the untwisting induced by MHD instability. The estimated duration time of
on-state is about one week, consistent with observations. Due to the MHD
instability, there exists an upper limit for the spin down ratio ($f\sim3$)
between the on-state and the off-state, if the Y-point remains at the light

quintuple layer is reactive to H$_2$O, resulting in a hydrated Bi bilayer as
well as some Bi islands, which passivate the surface and prevent from the
subsequent reaction. A reaction mechanism is proposed with H$_2$Te and hydrated
Bi as the products. Unexpectedly, our study indicates the reaction with water
is intrinsic and not dependent on any surface defects. Since water inevitably
exists, these findings provide key information when considering the reactions
of Bi$_2$Te$_3$ with residual gases or atmosphere.

theory in the Landau-DeWitt gauge. The background field that enters the
definition of the latter is intimately related with the (gauge-invariant)
Polyakov loop and serves as an equivalent order parameter for the deconfinement
transition. We use an effective gauge-fixed description where the
nonperturbative infrared dynamics of the theory is parametrized by a gluon mass
which, as argued elsewhere, may originate from the Gribov ambiguity. In this
scheme, one can perform consistent perturbative calculations down to infrared
momenta, which have been shown to correctly describe the phase diagram of
Yang-Mills theories in four dimensions as well as the zero-temperature
correlators computed in lattice simulations. In this article, we provide the
one-loop expressions of the finite temperature Landau-DeWitt ghost and gluon
propagators for a large class of gauge groups and present explicit results for
the SU(2) case. These are substantially different from those previously
obtained in the Landau gauge, which corresponds to a vanishing background
field. The nonanalyticity of the order parameter across the transition is
directly imprinted onto the propagators in the various color modes. In the
SU(2) case, this leads, for instance, to a cusp in the electric and magnetic
gluon susceptibilities as well as similar signatures in the ghost sector. We
mention the possibility that such distinctive features of the transition could
be measured in lattice simulations in the background field gauge studied here.

  Facility Location Problems: Natural LP is not too bad",,,,,"cs.DS","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In this paper, we give first constant factor approximation for capacitated
knapsack median problem (CKM) for hard uniform capacities, violating the budget
only by an additive factor of $f_{max}$ where $f_{max}$ is the maximum cost of
a facility opened by the optimal and violating capacities by $(2+\epsilon)$
factor. Natural LP for the problem is known to have an unbounded integrality
gap when any one of the two constraints is allowed to be violated by a factor
less than $2$. Thus, we present a result which is very close to the best
achievable from the natural LP. To the best of our knowledge, the problem has
not been studied earlier.
  For capacitated facility location problem with uniform capacities, a constant
factor approximation algorithm is presented violating the capacities a little
($1 + \epsilon$). Though constant factor results are known for the problem
without violating the capacities, the result is interesting as it is obtained
by rounding the solution to the natural LP, which is known to have an unbounded
integrality gap without violating the capacities. Thus, we achieve the best
possible from the natural LP for the problem. The result shows that natural LP
is not too bad.
  Finally, we raise some issues with the proofs of the results presented in
\cite{capkmByrkaFRS2013} for capacitated $k$-facility location problem
(C$k$FLP). \cite{capkmByrkaFRS2013} presents $O(1/\epsilon^2)$ approximation
violating the capacities by a factor of $(2 + \epsilon)$ using dependent
rounding. We first fix these issues using our techniques. Also, it can be
argued that (deterministic) pipage rounding cannot be used to open the
facilities instead of dependent rounding. Our techniques for CKM provide a

treasure, initially placed at distance $1$ from each other. The length $\beta$
of an arc (a fence) within the perimeter of the corresponding circle, as well
as the promise that the treasure is outside the fence, is given as part of the
input. The goal is to device movement trajectories so that the robot locates
the treasure in minimum time. Notably, although the presence of the fence
limits searching uncertainty, the location of the fence is unknown, and in the
worst case analysis is determined adversarially. Nevertheless, the robot has
the ability to move in the interior of the circle. In particular the robot can
attempt a number of chord-jump moves if it happens to be within the fence or if
an endpoint of the fence is discovered.
  The optimal solution to our question can be obtained as a solution to a
complicated optimization problem, which involves trigonometric functions, and
trigonometric equations that do not admit closed form solutions. For the 1-Jump
Algorithm, we fully describe the optimal trajectory, and provide an analysis of
the associated cost as a function of $\beta$. Our analysis indicates that the
optimal k-Jump Algorithm requires that the robot has enough memory and
computation power to compute the optimal chord-jumps. Motivated by this, we
give an abstract performance analysis for every k-Jump Algorithm. Subsequently,
we present a highly efficient Halving Heuristic k-Jump Algorithm that can
effectively approximate the optimal k-Jump Algorithm, with very limited memory

  One of our main results concerns the contact process on $T_d$ with $d\geq2$.
We show that, for large infection rate, there exists a subset $\Delta$ of the
vertices of $T_d$, containing a ""positive fraction"" of all the vertices of
$T_d$, such that the following holds: The contact process on $T_d$ observed on
$\Delta$ stochastically dominates an independent spin-flip process. (This is
known to be false for the contact process on graphs having subexponential

  We further prove that the supercritical contact process on $\mathbb{Z}^d$

have surface velocities that cannot be explained by single star evolution.
  Aims. We check whether tides between a star and a planet followed by planet
engulfment can indeed accelerate the surface rotation of red giants for a
sufficient long time in order to produce these fast rotating red giants.
  Methods. Using rotating stellar models, accounting for the redistribution of
the angular momentum inside the star by different transport mechanisms, for the
exchanges of angular momentum between the planet orbit and the star before the
engulfment and for the deposition of angular momentum inside the star at the
engulfment, we study how the surface rotation velocity at the stellar surface
evolves.
  Results. We show that the surface velocities reached at the end of the
orbital decay due to tidal forces and planet engulfment can be similar to
values observed for fast rotating red giants. This surface velocity then
decreases when the star evolves along the red giant branch but at a
sufficiently slow pace for allowing stars to be detected with such a high
velocity. More quantitatively, star-planet interaction can produce a rapid
acceleration of the surface of the star, above values equal to 8 km s$^{-1}$,
for periods lasting up to more than 30% the red giant branch phase. The changes
of the surface carbon isotopic ratios produced by the dilution of the planetary
material into the convective envelope is quite modest. Much more important
might be the increase of the lithium abundance due to this effect. However
lithium may be affected by many different, still uncertain, processes.
  Conclusions. The acceleration of the stellar surface to rotation velocities
above limits that depend on the surface gravity does appear at the moment as
the clearest signature of a star-planet interaction.[abridged]

establishes that the logarithm of the dimension of the key system (call it
$\log_{2}K$) in an $\varepsilon$-approximate private state is bounded from

$\varepsilon$ and $\log_{2}K$. Importantly, the extra term does not depend on

important projective invariant in Finsler geometry. To find more Douglas
metrics, in this paper we consider a class of Finsler metrics called general
$(\alpha,\beta)$-metrics, which are defined by a Riemannian metric
$\alpha=\sqrt{a_{ij}(x)y^iy^j}$ and a $1$-form $\beta=b_i(x)y^i$. We obtain the
differential equations that characterizes these metrics with vanishing Douglas
curvature. By solving the equivalent PDEs, the metrics in this class are
totally determined. Then many new Douglas metrics are constructed.

and distance weighted discrimination (DWD), are commonly used in biomedical
research to distinguish groups of subjects based on a large number of features.
However, their use is limited to applications where a single vector of features
is measured for each subject. In practice data are often multi-way, or measured
over multiple dimensions. For example, metabolite abundance may be measured
over multiple regions or tissues, or gene expression may be measured over
multiple time points, for the same subjects. We propose a framework for linear
classification of high-dimensional multi-way data, in which coefficients can be
factorized into weights that are specific to each dimension. More generally,
the coefficients for each measurement in a multi-way dataset are assumed to
have low-rank structure. This framework extends existing classification
techniques, and we have implemented multi-way versions of SVM and DWD. We
describe informative simulation results, and apply multi-way DWD to data for
two very different clinical research studies. The first study uses metabolite
magnetic resonance spectroscopy data over multiple brain regions to compare
patients with and without spinocerebellar ataxia, the second uses publicly
available gene expression time-course data to compare treatment responses for
patients with multiple sclerosis. Our method improves performance and
simplifies interpretation over naive applications of full rank linear
classification to multi-way data. An R package is available at

macroscopic physics governed by the laws of Newton and Einstein. The correct
definition of nanophysics is the physics of structures and artefacts with
dimensions in the nanometer range or of phenomena occurring in nanoseconds.
Modern physical methods whose fundamental are developed in physics laboratories
have become critically important in nanoscience. Nanophysics brings together
multiple disciplines, using theoretical and experimental methods to determine
the physical properties of materials in the nanoscale size range. Interesting
properties include the structural, electronic, optical, and thermal behavior of
nanomaterials, electrical and thermal conductivity, the forces between
nanoscale objects, and the transition between classical and quantum behavior.
Nanophysics has now become an independent branch of physics, simultaneously
expanding into many new areas and playing a vital role in fields that were once
the domain of engineering, chemical, or life sciences. Nanoscience and
nanotechnology are all about relating and exploiting phenomena for materials
having one, two or three dimensions reduced to the nanoscale. Breakthroughs in
nanotechnology require a firm grounding in the principles of nanophysics. It is
intended to fulfill a crucial purpose. Nanophysics aims to connect scientists
with disparate interests to begin interdisciplinary projects and incorporate
the theory and methodology of other fields into their work.

boundary conditions were applied for evaporator and condenser sections,
respectively. Water and ethanol were used as working fluids. Volume of Fluid

of temperature time series was carried out using Power Spectrum Density (PSD)
method. Existence of dominant peak in PSD diagram indicated periodic or
quasi-periodic behavior in temperature oscillations at particular frequencies.
Correlation dimension values for ethanol as working fluid was found to be
higher than that for water under the same operating conditions. Similar range
of Lyapunov exponent values for the PHP with water and ethanol as working
fluids indicated strong dependency of Lyapunov exponent to the structure and
dimensions of the PHP. An O-ring structure pattern was obtained for
reconstructed 3D attractor at periodic or quasi-periodic behavior of
