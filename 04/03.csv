the Higgs oscillator. This operator structure has emerged from a relation
between the Higgs oscillator Schroedinger equation and the Klein-Gordon

Alternating Linearized Minimization (PALM) algorithm for solving nonsmooth,

Asynchronous PALM algorithm updates a single block of coordinates; but unlike
the PALM algorithm, the Asynchronous PALM algorithm eliminates the need for
sequential updates that occur one after the other. Instead, our new algorithm
allows each of the coordinate blocks to be updated asynchronously and in any

parallel without synchronizing their computations. In practice, this
asynchronization strategy often leads to speedups that increase linearly with
the number of computing cores.

show that cluster points of the algorithm are stationary points. In the

Kurdyka-{\L}ojasiewicz property holds for a function closely related to the

stage we study the statics. At a given mass asymmetry up to about $\eta=0.5$
the potential barrier has a two hump shape, but for larger $\eta$ it has only
one hump. The touching point deformation energy versus mass asymmetry shows the
three minima, produced by shell effects, corresponding to three decay modes:
spontaneous fission, cluster decay and $\alpha$~decay. The least action
trajectory is determined in the plane $(R,\eta)$ where $R$ is the separation
distance of the fission fragments and $\eta$ is the mass asymmetry. We may find
a sequence of several trajectories one of which gives the least action. The
parametrization with two deformation coordinates $(R,\eta)$ and the radius of

the simpler one, in which $R_2$~=constant. The latter is closer to the reality

f(z|x) when x represents high-dimensional, complex data. In this paper, we
propose a new nonparametric estimator of f(z|x) that adapts to sparse

eigenfunctions of a kernel-based operator, we avoid tensor products in high
dimensions as well as ratios of estimated densities. Our basis functions are
orthogonal with respect to the underlying data distribution, allowing fast
implementation and tuning of parameters. We derive rates of convergence and
show that the method adapts to the intrinsic dimension of the data. We also
demonstrate the effectiveness of the series method on images, spectra, and an
application to photometric redshift estimation of galaxies.

  Dual Approach: Algorithms, Convergence, and Applications",,,,,"math.OC cs.IT math.IT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In this paper, we propose a new decomposition approach named the proximal
primal dual algorithm (Prox-PDA) for smooth nonconvex linearly constrained
optimization problems. The proposed approach is primal-dual based, where the
primal step minimizes certain approximation of the augmented Lagrangian of the
problem, and the dual step performs an approximate dual ascent. The
approximation used in the primal step is able to decompose the variable blocks,
making it possible to obtain simple subproblems by leveraging the problem
structures. Theoretically, we show that whenever the penalty parameter in the
augmented Lagrangian is larger than a given threshold, the Prox-PDA converges
to the set of stationary solutions, globally and in a sublinear manner (i.e.,
certain measure of stationarity decreases in the rate of $\mathcal{O}(1/r)$,
where $r$ is the iteration counter). Interestingly, when applying a variant of
the Prox-PDA to the problem of distributed nonconvex optimization (over a
connected undirected graph), the resulting algorithm coincides with the popular
EXTRA algorithm [Shi et al 2014], which is only known to work in convex cases.
Our analysis implies that EXTRA and its variants converge globally sublinearly
to stationary solutions of certain nonconvex distributed optimization problem.
There are many possible extensions of the Prox-PDA, and we present one
particular extension to certain nonconvex distributed matrix factorization
problem.

ATLASGAL survey.
  Methods. We use the DisPerSE algorithm to identify spatially coherent
structures located across the inner-Galaxy (300 < l < 60 and |b| < 1.5).
  Results. We have determined distances, masses and physical sizes for 241 of
the filamentary structures. We find a median distance of 3.8 kpc, a mean mass
of a few 10^3 m_sun, a mean length of ~6pc and a mass-to-length ratio of (M/L)
~200-2000M_sun/ pc. We also find that these filamentary structures are tightly
correlated with the spiral arms in longitude and velocity, and that their
semi-major axis is preferentially aligned parallel to the Galactic mid-plane
and therefore with the direction of large-scale Galactic magnetic field. We
find many examples where the dense filaments identified in ATLASGAL are
associated with larger scale filamentary structures (~100 pc), and argue that
this is likely to be common, and as such these may indicate a connection
between large-scale Galactic dynamics and star formation.
  Conclusions. We have produced a large and Galaxy-wide catalogue of dense
filamentary structures that are representative of a particular size and mass
range not previously well studied in the literature. Analyses of the properties
and distribution of these filaments reveals that they are correlated with the
spiral arms and make a significant contribution to star formation in the
Galaxy. Massive star formation is ongoing within ~20% of the filaments and is
strongly correlated with the filaments with the largest mass-to- length ratios.
The luminosity of the embedded sources has a similar distribution to the
Galactic-wide samples of young massive stars and can therefore be considered to
be representative.

interacting in dynamic environments is challenging. By leveraging parametric
uncertainty within the model description, one can relax the requirement to
describe exactly the interactions with the environment; however, one must still
guarantee that the model, despite uncertainty, behaves acceptably. This paper
presents a convex optimization method to efficiently compute the set of
configurations of a polynomial dynamical system that are able to safely reach a
user defined target set despite parametric uncertainty in the model. Since
planning in the presence of uncertainty can lead to undesirable conservatives,
this paper computes those trajectories of the uncertain nonlinear systems which
are $\alpha$-probable of reaching the desired configuration. The presented
approach uses the notion of occupation measures to describe the evolution of
trajectories of a nonlinear system with parametric uncertainty as a linear
equation over measures whose supports coincide with the trajectories under
investigation. This linear equation is approximated with vanishing conservatism
using a hierarchy of semidefinite programs each of which is proven to compute
an approximation to the set of initial conditions that are $\alpha$-probable of
reaching the user defined target set safely in spite of uncertainty. The
efficacy of this method is illustrated on four systems with parametric
uncertainty.

attracted significant amount of attention. Traditional electronic EM wave

problems, integrated photonic EM wave sensors have been developed to provide
high sensitivity and broad bandwidth. Previously we demonstrated a compact,
broadband, and sensitive integrated photonic EM wave sensor, consisting of an
organic electro-optic (EO) polymer refilled silicon slot photonic crystal
waveguide (PCW) modulator integrated with a gold bowtie antenna, to detect the
X band of the electromagnetic spectrum. However, due to the relative large RC
constant of the silicon PCW, such EM wave sensors can only work up to tens of
GHz. In this work, we present a detailed design and discussion of a new
generation of EM wave sensors based on EO polymer refilled plasmonic slot
waveguides in conjunction with bowtie antennas to cover a wider electromagnetic
spectrum from 1 GHz up to 10THz, including the range of microwave, millimeter
wave and even terahertz waves. This antenna-coupled plasmonic-organic hybrid
(POH) structure is designed to provide an ultra-small RC constant, a large
overlap between plasmonic mode and RF field, and strong electric field
enhancement, as well as negligible field perturbation. A taper is designed to
bridge silicon strip waveguide to plasmonic slot waveguide. Simulation results
show that our device can have an EM wave sensing ability up to 10 THz. To the

Graphs (DAG). Previous broadcast algorithms route packets along spanning trees.
In large networks with time-varying connectivities, these trees are difficult
to compute and maintain. In this paper we propose a new online
throughput-optimal broadcast algorithm which makes packet-by-packet scheduling
and routing decisions, obviating the need for maintaining any global
topological structures, such as spanning-trees. Our algorithm relies on
system-state information for making transmission decisions and hence, may be
thought of as a generalization of the well-known back-pressure algorithm which
makes point-to-point unicast transmission decisions based on queue-length
information, without requiring knowledge of end-to-end paths. Technically, the
back-pressure algorithm is derived by stochastically stabilizing the
network-queues. However, because of packet-duplications associated with
broadcast, the work-conservation principle is violated and queuing processes
are difficult to define in the broadcast problem. To address this fundamental
issue, we identify certain state-variables which behave like virtual queues in
the broadcast setting. By stochastically stabilizing these virtual queues, we
devise a throughput-optimal broadcast policy. We also derive new
characterizations of the broadcast-capacity of time-varying wireless DAGs and
derive an efficient algorithm to compute the capacity exactly under certain
assumptions of interference model, and a poly-time approximation algorithm for
computing the capacity under less restrictive assumptions.

better strength-ductility combination in contrast to disordered grain
boundaries. Twinning deformation typically involves the kinetics of stacking
faults, its interaction with dislocations, and dislocation - twin boundary
interactions. While the latter has been intensively investigated, the dynamics
of stacking faults has been less known. In this work, we report several new
insights on the stacking fault behavior in twin induced plasticity from our
meta-atom molecular dynamics simulation: The stacking fault interactions are
dominated by dislocation reactions taking place spontaneously, different from
the proposed mechanism in literatures; The competition among generating a
single stacking fault, a twinning partial and a trailing partial dislocation is
dependent on a unique parameter, i.e. stacking fault energy, which in turn
determines deformation twinning behaviors. The complex twin-slip and
twin-dislocation interactions demonstrate the dual role of deformation twins as
both dislocation barrier and storage, potentially contributing to the high
strength and ductility of advanced materials like TWIP steels where deformation
twinning dominated plasticity accounts for the superb strength-ductility
combination.

separate antennas at elevated power levels, which allows these signals to be
jointly decoded at one receiver which has fewer spatial dimensions with lower
interference floors, while another receiver is simultaneously able to
separately decode these signals with a higher interference floor but across a

because they can explain the formation of many networks like social networks,
citation networks, power grids, and biological networks, to name a few.
Motivated by the application of key predistribution in wireless sensor networks
(WSN), we initiate the study of preferential attachment with degree bound.
  Our paper has two important contributions to two different areas. The first
is a contribution in the study of complex networks. We propose preferential
attachment model with degree bound for the first time. In the normal
preferential attachment model, the degree distribution follows a power law,
with many nodes of low degree and a few nodes of high degree. In our scheme,
the nodes can have a maximum degree $d_{\max}$, where $d_{\max}$ is an integer
chosen according to the application. The second is in the security of wireless
sensor networks. We propose a new key predistribution scheme based on the above
model. The important features of this model are that the network is fully
connected, it has fewer keys, has larger size of the giant component and lower
average path length compared with traditional key predistribution schemes and
comparable resilience to random node attacks.
  We argue that in many networks like key predistribution and Internet of
Things, having nodes of very high degree will be a bottle-neck in
communication. Thus, studying preferential attachment model with degree bound
will open up new directions in the study of complex networks, and will have
many applications in real world scenarios.

correlation measures for an arbitrary bipartite state. The measures utilize the
general Schatten $p$-norm to quantify the amount of departure from the
necessary and sufficient condition of classicality of correlations provided by
the concept of NDLID. We show that for the case of Hilbert-Schmidt norm, i.e.
$p=2$, a closed formula is available for an arbitrary bipartite state. The
reliability of the proposed measures is checked from the information theoretic
perspective. Also, the monotonicity behavior of these measures under LOCC is
exemplified. The results reveal that for the general pure bipartite states
these measures have an upper bound which is an entanglement monotone in its own
right. This enables us to introduce a new measure of entanglement, for a
general bipartite state, by convex roof construction. Some examples and
comparison with other quantum correlation measures are also provided.

symmetry-breaking self-propulsion is distinct from other self-propulsion
mechanisms due to the intrinsic polarity such as squirmers and self-phoretic
motion; there is a bifurcation point below which the drop is stationary and
above which it moves spontaneously. When two drops moving along the same axis
with opposite direction, the interactions arise both from hydrodynamics and
concentration overlap. We found that two drops exhibit either elastic collision
or fusion depending on the distance from the bifurcation point controlled, for
instance, by viscosity. The elastic collision results from the balance between
dissipation and energy injection by chemical reactions. We derive the reduced
equations for the collision between two drops and analyze the contributions
from the two interactions. The concentration-mediated interaction is found to
dominate the hydrodynamic interaction.

interface, reducing the surface tension and producing mesophases. Here, the
cations and anions are loosely bound by the Coulomb attraction across the
interface on the scale of the Debye screening length. Second, on solid
surfaces, hydrophilic (hydrophobic) ions are trapped in a water-rich (oil-rich)

spurious polarization. The Stokes I flux of 3.6$\pm$0.72 Jy during our run is
consistent with extrapolations from the previous, lower frequency observations.
We found that the continuum emission of Sgr A* at $\sim$492 GHz shows large
amplitude differences between the XX and the YY correlations. The observed
intensity ratio between the XX and YY correlations as a function of parallactic
angle may be explained by a constant polarization position angle of
$\sim$158$^{\circ}$$\pm$3$^{\circ}$. The fitted polarization percentage of Sgr

polarization position angle in the present work appear consistent with those

Our HyperNet is primarily based on an elaborately designed Hyper Feature which
aggregates hierarchical feature maps first and then compresses them into a
uniform space. The Hyper Features well incorporate deep but highly semantic,
intermediate but really complementary, and shallow but naturally
high-resolution features of the image, thus enabling us to construct HyperNet
by sharing them both in generating proposals and detecting objects via an

verified through stiffness measurements using three independent approaches:
interferometric measurement, AC approach-curve calibration, and finite element
analysis simulation. Power-law values for calibrating higher-mode stiffnesses

of perturbations that induce failure, researchers have used a variety of

in dynamical systems theory to develop a personalised, automated framework to
compute the set of perturbations from which a system can avoid failure, which
is known as the basin of stability. The approach tracks human motion to
synthesise a control input that is analysed to measure the basin of stability.
The utility of this analysis is verified on a Sit-to-Stand task performed by 15

convergent scheme that switches the control parameter within a set of values
while the controlled system is numerically integrated. The attractor obtained
with the PS algorithm matches the attractor obtained by integrating the system
with the parameter replaced by the averaged value of the switched parameter
values. The switching rule can be applied periodically or randomly over a set
of given values. In this way, every stable cycle of the HP system can be
approximated if its underlying parameter value equalizes the average value of
the switching values. Moreover, the PS algorithm can be viewed as a
generalization of Parrondo's game, which is applied for the first time to the
HP system, by showing that losing strategy can win: ""losing + losing =
winning"". If ""loosing"" is replaced with ""chaos"" and, ""winning"" with ""order"" (as
the opposite to ""chaos""), then by switching the parameter value in the HP
system within two values, which generate chaotic motions, the PS algorithm can
approximate a stable cycle so that symbolically one can write ""chaos + chaos =

inverse seesaw models, respectively, in explaining the naturally small neutrino
mass. TeV scale heavy neutrinos can also be accommodated to have a sizable
mixing with the Standard Model light neutrinos, through which they can be
produced and detected at the high energy colliders. In this paper we consider
the Next-to-Leading Order QCD corrections to the heavy neutrino production, and
study the scale variation in cross-sections as well as the kinematic
distributions with different final states at $14$ TeV LHC and also in the
context of $100$ TeV hadron collider. The repertoire of the Majorana neutrino
is realized through the characteristic signature of the same-sign dilepton
pair, whereas, due to a small lepton number violation, the pseudo-Dirac heavy
neutrino can manifest the trileptons associated with missing energy in the
final state. Using the $\sqrt{s}=8$ TeV, $20.3$ fb$^{-1}$ and $19.7$ fb$^{-1}$
data at the ATLAS and CMS respectively, we obtain prospective scale dependent
upper bounds of the light-heavy neutrino mixing angles for the Majorana heavy
neutrinos at the $14$ TeV LHC and $100$ TeV collider. Further exploiting a
recent study on the anomalous multilepton search by CMS at $\sqrt{s}=8$ TeV
with $19.5$ fb$^{-1}$ data, we also obtain the prospective scale dependent
upper bounds on the mixing angles for the pseudo-Dirac neutrinos. We thus
project a scale dependent prospective reach using the NLO processes at the $14$

for 7 nights in 2004. Totally 2 triplets, 4 doublets, and 5 singlets were
identified. The frequency splitting values are very different, from 5.2 $\mu$Hz
to 11.9 $\mu$Hz, which may reflect differential rotations. We evolve grids of
white dwarf models by \texttt{MESA}. Cores, added with He/C envelopes, of those
white dwarf models are inserted into \texttt{WDEC} to evolve grids of DBV star
models. With those DBV star models, we calculate eigenperiods. Those calculated
periods are used to fit observed periods. A best-fitting model is selected. The
parameters are $T_{eff}$ = 25000 K, $M_{*}$ = 0.740 $M_{\odot}$, and
log($M_{He}/M_{*}$) = -4.5. With the massive stellar mass, the effective
temperature is close to previous spectroscopic result. In addition, kinetic
energy distributions are calculated for the best-fitting model. We find that
the observed modes with large frequency splitting values are fitted by the
calculated modes with much kinetic energy distributed in C/O core. After
preliminary analysis, we suggest that the C/O core may rotate at least 2 times
faster than the helium layer for CBS 114.

specific algorithms used are the correlation coefficient change statistic and
the intensity ratio change statistic algorithms. Therefore these algorithms and
the probabilistic selection of the threshold criteria is reviewed and
discussed. A recently offered change detection method which depends on the idea
of generating two different final change maps of two images in a sequence, is
used. First final change map is obtained by cumulatively adding the sequences
of change maps in such a manner that common change areas are excluded and
uncommon change areas are included. The second final change map is obtained by
comparing the first and the last images in the temporal sequence. This method
requires at least three images to be employed and can be generalized to longer
temporal image sequences. The purpose of this approach is to provide a double
check mechanism to the conventional approach and thus to reduce the probability
of false alarm and enhance the change detection. The algorithms mentioned are
applied to a 2010 Gulf of Mexico oil spill imagery together with the method
described. It is shown that intensity ratio change statistic is a better tool
for identification of the changes due to the oil spill compared to the
correlation coefficient change statistic. It is also shown that two final
change map method can reduce the probability of false alarm. The data used in
this study is acquired by the Japanese Aerospace Agency's Advanced Land
Observing Satellite (ALOS) through Alaska SAR Facility (ASF) at the University
of Alaska, Fairbanks, AK.

handling of missed outcomes and validated these models on the data of 15,437
patients which arrived into TARN hospitals later than 24 hours but within 30
days from injury. We used these Markov models for the analysis of mortality. In

give 7.20\% (available case study) or 6.36\% (if we assume that all unknown
outcomes are `alive'). The corrected value is 6.78\%. Following the seminal
paper of Trunkey (1983) the multimodality of mortality curves has become a much
discussed idea. For the whole analysed TARN dataset the coefficient of
mortality monotonically decreases in time but the stratified analysis of the
mortality gives a different result: for lower severities the coefficient of
mortality is a non-monotonic function of the time after injury and may have
maxima at the second and third weeks. The approach developed here can be
applied to various healthcare datasets which experience the problem of lost

where a spatially-discrete system is approximated by a spatially-continuous
one, governed by linear PDEs forming diffusion equations. In the case of
distributed consensus algorithms, this approach is adapted to enhance its
convergence rate to the equilibrium. In previous studies within this context,
constant diffusion parameter is considered for obtaining the diffusion
equations. This is equivalent to assigning a constant weight to all edges of
the underlying graph in the consensus algorithm. Here, by relaxing this
restricting assumption, a spatially-variable diffusion parameter is considered
and by optimizing the obtained system, it is shown that significant
improvements are achievable in terms of the convergence rate of the obtained
spatially-continuous system. As a result of approximation, the system is
divided into two sections, namely, the spatially-continuous path branches and
the lattice core which connects these branches at one end. The optimized
weights and diffusion parameter for each of these sections are optimal
individually but considering the whole system, they are suboptimal. It is shown
that the symmetric star topology is an exception and the obtained results for
this topology are globally optimal. Furthermore, through variational method,
the results obtained for the symmetric star topology are validated and it is
shown that the variable diffusion parameter improves the robustness of the

essential for the advancement of future wireless communications. The stochastic
nature of wireless channels in general gives rise to a time varying
transmission rate. In such an environment, interference is increasingly
becoming a key constraint. Obtaining an expressive model for offered service of
such channels has major implications in the design and optimization of future
networks. However, interference channels are not well-understood with respect
to their higher layer performance. The particular difficulty for handling
interference channels arises from the superposition of random fading processes
for the signals of the transmitters involved (i.e., for the signal of interest
and for the signals of the interferers). Starting from the distribution of the
signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR), we derive a statistical
characterization of the underlying service process in terms of its Mellin
transform. Then, we adapt a recent stochastic network calculus approach for
fading channels to derive measures of the queuing performance of single- and
multi-hop wireless interference networks. Special cases of our solution include
noise-limited and interference-limited systems. A key finding of our analysis
is that for a given average signal and average sum interference power, the
performance of interfered systems not only depends on the relative strength of
the sum interference with respect to the signal-of-interest power, but also on
the interference structure (i.e., the number of interferers) as well as the

that in case of the observed down-chirping BAEs the changes in the radial
structure are smaller than the uncertainty of our measurement. This behaviour
is most probably the consequence of that BAEs are normal modes, thus their
radial structure strongly depends on the background plasma parameters rather

analysis consistently shows shrinkage of the mode structure. The proposed
explanation is that the resonance in the velocity space moves towards more

AOP allows COARA to intercept code for offloading without a customized compiler

begin execution of the offloaded application code, regardless of whether all
required objects been transferred to the server. We run COARA with Android

problem is through Neuroevolution, a method which trains Artificial Neural
Networks using evolutionary algorithms. In this article, we introduce a
framework for testing optimization algorithms with artificial agent controllers
in electronic games, called EvoMan, which is inspired in the action-platformer
game Mega Man II. The environment can be configured to run in different
experiment modes, as single evolution, coevolution and others. To demonstrate
some challenges regarding the proposed platform, as initial experiments we
applied Neuroevolution using Genetic Algorithms and the NEAT algorithm, in the
context of competitively coevolving two distinct agents in this game.

  arXiv:1512.06176",,,,"cs.IT math.IT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Heterogeneous wireless networks (HetNets) provide a powerful approach to meet
the dramatic mobile traffic growth, but also impose a significant challenge on
backhaul. Caching and multicasting at macro and pico base stations (BSs) are
two promising methods to support massive content delivery and reduce backhaul
load in HetNets. In this paper, we jointly consider caching and multicasting in
a large-scale cache-enabled HetNet with backhaul constraints. We propose a
hybrid caching design consisting of identical caching in the macro-tier and
random caching in the pico-tier, and a corresponding multicasting design. By
carefully handling different types of interferers and adopting appropriate
approximations, we derive tractable expressions for the successful transmission
probability in the general region as well as the high signal-to-noise ratio
(SNR) and user density region, utilizing tools from stochastic geometry. Then,
we consider the successful transmission probability maximization by optimizing
the design parameters, which is a very challenging mixed discrete-continuous
optimization problem due to the sophisticated structure of the successful
transmission probability. By using optimization techniques and exploring the
structural properties, we obtain a near optimal solution with superior
performance and manageable complexity. This solution achieves better
performance in the general region than any asymptotically optimal solution,
under a mild condition. The analysis and optimization results provide valuable
design insights for practical cache-enabled HetNets.

their X-ray emission. Stellar coronal emission includes radio emission, and AGN
corona may also be a significant source for radio emission in radio quiet (RQ)
AGN. We calculate the coronal properties required to produce the observed radio
emission in RQ AGN, either from synchrotron emission of power-law (PL)
electrons, or from cyclo-synchrotron emission of hot mildly-relativistic
thermal electrons. We find that a flat spectrum, as observed in about half of
RQ AGN, can be produced by corona with a disc or a spherical configuration,
which extends from the innermost regions out to a pc scale. A spectral break to
an optically thin power-law emission is expected around 300-1000 GHz, as the
innermost corona becomes optically thin. In case of thermal electrons, a sharp
spectral cutoff is expected above the break. The position of the break can be
measured with VLBI observations, which exclude the cold dust emission, and it
can be used to probe the properties of the innermost corona. Assuming
equipartition of the coronal thermal energy density, the PL electrons energy
density, and the magnetic field, we find that the energy density in a disc
corona should scale as $\sim R^{-1.3}$, to get a flat spectrum. In the
spherical case the energy density scales as $\sim R^{-2}$, and is $\sim 4\times
10^{-4}$ of the AGN radiation energy density. In paper II we derive additional
constraints on the coronal parameters from the Gudel-Benz relation, $L_{\rm
Radio}/L_{\rm X-ray}\sim 10^{-5}$, which RQ AGN follow.

require working with very large and complex datasets - e.g., the Web graph -

such scenarios due to their high computational complexity and poor scalability
on large data.
  In this paper, we propose a novel and scalable approach for multi-relational
factorization based on consensus optimization. Our model, called ConsMRF, is
based on the Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM) framework,
which enables us to optimize each target relation using a smaller set of
parameters than the state-of-the-art competitors in this task.
  Due to ADMM's nature, ConsMRF can be easily parallelized which makes it
suitable for large multi-relational data. Experiments on large Web datasets -
derived from DBpedia, Wikipedia and YAGO - show the efficiency and performance
improvement of ConsMRF over strong competitors. In addition, ConsMRF
near-linear scalability indicates great potential to tackle Web-scale problem
sizes.
