  large-scale survey of blue whales","33 pages 19 figures",,,,"stat.ME","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Distance sampling is a widely used method for estimating wildlife population
abundance. The fact that conventional distance sampling methods are partly
design-based constrains the spatial resolution at which animal density can be
estimated using these methods. Estimates are usually obtained at survey stratum
level. For an endangered species such as the blue whale, it is desirable to
estimate density and abundance at a finer spatial scale than stratum. Temporal
variation in the spatial structure is also important. We formulate the process
generating distance sampling data as a thinned spatial point process and
propose model-based inference using a spatial log-Gaussian Cox process. The
method adopts a flexible stochastic partial differential equation (SPDE)
approach to model spatial structure in density that is not accounted for by
explanatory variables, and integrated nested Laplace approximation (INLA) for
Bayesian inference. It allows simultaneous fitting of detection and density
models and permits prediction of density at an arbitrarily fine scale. We
estimate blue whale density in the Eastern Tropical Pacific Ocean from thirteen
shipboard surveys conducted over 22 years. We find that higher blue whale
density is associated with colder sea surface temperatures in space, and
although there is some positive association between density and mean annual
temperature, our estimates are consitent with no trend in density across years.
Our analysis also indicates that there is substantial spatially structured
variation in density that is not explained by available covariates.

synthesized under certain growth conditions to favor the appearance of wurtzite
crystal phase. Despite the reports in literature of ab initio band structures
for these wurtzite compounds, we still lack effective multiband models and
parameter sets that can be simply used to investigate physical properties of
such systems, for instance, under quantum confinement effects. In order to
address this deficiency, in this study we calculate the ab initio band
structure of bulk InAs and InP in wurtzite phase and develop an 8$\times$8 k.p
Hamiltonian to describe the energy bands around $\Gamma$ point. We show that
our k.p model is robust and can be fitted to describe the important features of
the ab initio band structure. The correct description of the spin splitting
effects that arise due to the lack of inversion symmetry in wurtzite crystals,
is obtained with the $k$-dependent spin-orbit term in the Hamiltonian, often
neglected in the literature. All the energy bands display a Rashba-like spin
texture for the in-plane spin expectation value. We also provide the density of
states and the carrier density as functions of the Fermi energy. Alternatively,
we show an analytical description of the conduction band, valid close to
$\Gamma$ point. The same fitting procedure is applied to the 6$\times$6 valence
band Hamiltonian. However, we find that the most reliable approach is the
8$\times$8 k.p Hamiltonian for both compounds. The k.p Hamiltonians and
parameter sets that we develop in this paper provide a reliable theoretical
framework that can be easily applied to investigate electronic, transport,
optical, and spin properties of InAs- and InP-based nanostructures.

investigated. First passage time techniques are employed to calculate the
statistical moments of the number of inflationary $e$-folds, which give rise to
all correlation functions of primordial curvature perturbations through the
stochastic $\delta N$ formalism. The number of fields is a critical parameter.
The probability of exploring arbitrarily large-field regions of the potential
becomes non-vanishing when more than two fields are driving inflation. The mean
number of $e$-folds can be infinite, depending on the number of fields; for
plateau potentials, this occurs even with one field. In such cases, correlation
functions of curvature perturbations are infinite. They can, however, be
regularised if a reflecting (or absorbing) wall is added at large energy or
field value. The results are found to be independent of the exact location of
the wall and this procedure is, therefore, well-defined for a wide range of
cutoffs, above or below the Planck scale. Finally, we show that, contrary to
single-field setups, multi-field models can yield large stochastic corrections
even at sub-Planckian energy, opening interesting prospects for probing quantum
effects on cosmological fluctuations.

'cosmology is the hydrodynamics of quantum gravity': the classical Friedmann

from fundamental quantum gravity. We take one further step towards
strengthening the link with LQC and show, in a class of GFT models for gravity
coupled to a free massless scalar field and for generic initial conditions,
that GFT condensates dynamically reach a low spin phase of many quanta of
geometry, in which all but an exponentially small number of quanta are
characterised by a single spin $j_0$ (i.e. by a constant volume per quantum).
As the low spin regime is reached, GFT condensates expand to exponentially
large volumes, and the dynamics of the total volume follows precisely the
classical Friedmann equations. This behaviour follows from a single requirement
on the couplings in the GFT model under study. We present one particular simple
case in which the dominant spin is the lowest one: $j_0=0$ or, if this is
excluded, $j_0=1/2$. The type of quantum state usually assumed in the
derivation of LQC is hence derived from the quantum dynamics of GFT. These
results confirm and extend recent results by Oriti, Sindoni and Wilson-Ewing in

thoroughly researched, the understanding of Spatially Correlated Noise (SCN) is

spatial correlation function in the particle-bath interactions. This expression
shows that SCN is the inherent component of binary mixtures, originating from
the effective (entropic) interactions. Further, employing this spatial
correlation function, we postulate the thermodynamically consistent Langevin

thermodynamical consistency is achieved by introducing the spatially variant
friction coefficient, which can be also derived analytically. This coefficient
exhibits a number of intriguing properties, e.g. the singular behavior for
certain interaction types. Eventually, we apply this new theory to the system
of two charged particles in the presence of counter-ions. Such particles
interact via the screened-charge Yukawa potential and the inclusion of SCN
leads to the emergence of the anomalous frictionless regime. In this regime the
particles can experience active propulsion leading to the transient attraction
effect. This effect suggests a non-equilibrium mechanism facilitating the
molecular binding of the like-charged particles.

Subsequently, estimation proceeds using cyclic monotonicity moment inequalities

OSIRIS instrument at the GTC in long slit spectroscopy mode, placing HAT-P-32

covering two transit events. Using the best quality data set, we were able to
yield 20 narrow-band transit light curves, with each passband spanning a 20 nm
wide interval. After removal of all systematic noise signals and light curve
modeling the uncertainties for the resulting radius ratios lie between 337 and
972 ppm. The radius ratios show little variation with wavelength suggesting a
high altitude cloud layer masking any atmospheric features. Alternatively, a
strong depletion in alkali metals or a much smaller than expected planetary
atmospheric scale height could be responsible for the lack of atmospheric
features. Our result of a flat transmission spectrum is consistent with a
previous ground-based study of the optical spectrum of this planet. This
agreement between independent results demonstrates that ground-based
measurements of exoplanet atmospheres can give reliable and reproducible
results despite the fact that the data often is heavily affected by systematic
noise, as long as the noise source is well understood and properly corrected.

be initialized with $n$ and an additional parameter $t\in\mathbb{N}$ and
subsequently occupies $n+O(n(t/w)^t+\log n)$ bits of memory and executes each
of the four operations insert, delete, contains (i.e., a membership query) and
choice in $O(t)$ time on a word RAM with a word length of $w=\Omega(\log n)$
bits. In particular, with $w=\Theta(\log n)$, we can support insert, delete,
contains and choice in constant time using $n+O(n/(\log n)^t)$ bits for
arbitrary fixed $t$. We extend our results to maintaining several pairwise
disjoint subsets of $\{1,\ldots,n\}$.
  We study additional space-efficient data structures for subsets $S$ of
$\{1,\ldots,n\}$, including one that supports only insertion and an operation
extract-choice that returns and deletes an arbitrary element of $S$. All our
main data structures can be initialized in constant time and support efficient
iteration over the set $S$, and we can allow changes to $S$ while an iteration
over $S$ is in progress. We use these abilities crucially in designing the most
space-efficient algorithms known for solving a number of graph and other
combinatorial problems in linear time. In particular, given an undirected graph
$G$ with $n$ vertices and $m$ edges, we can output a spanning forest of $G$ in
$O(n+m)$ time with at most $(1+\epsilon)n$ bits of working memory for arbitrary
fixed $\epsilon>0$.

freely-suspended two-dimensional condensed-matter film, i.e., an explicit
realization of a 2D brane. The large contributions of vacuum fluctuations to
the surface tension of this film are cancelled in equilibrium by the
thermodynamic potential arising from the conservation law for particle number.
In short, the surface tension of the film vanishes in equilibrium due to a
thermodynamic identity. This 2D brane can be generalized to a 4D brane with
gravity. For the 4D brane, the analogue of the 2D surface tension is the 4D
cosmological constant, which is also nullified in full equilibrium. The 4D
brane theory provides an alternative description of the phenomenological
$q$-theory of the quantum vacuum. As for other realizations of the vacuum
variable $q$, such as the 4-form field-strength realization, the main
ingredient is the conservation law for the variable $q$, which makes the vacuum
a self-sustained system. For a vacuum within this class, the nullification of
the cosmological constant takes place automatically in equilibrium. Out of
equilibrium, the cosmological constant can be as large as suggested by naive
estimates based on the summation of zero-point energies. In this brane
description, $q$-theory also corresponds to a generalization of unimodular
gravity.

discovered in the insolation habitable zone (HZ) have high orbital
eccentricities (e.g., up to an eccentricity of $\sim0.97$ for HD~20782~b). This
raises the question of the capacity of these planets to host surface liquid
water. In order to assess the habitability of an eccentric planet, the mean
flux approximation is often used. It states that a planet on an eccentric orbit
is called habitable if it receives on average a flux compatible with the
presence of surface liquid water. However, as the planets do experience
important insolation variations over one orbit and even spend some time outside
the HZ for high eccentricities, the question of their habitability might not be
as straightforward. We performed a set of simulations using the Global Climate
Model LMDz, exploring the limits of the mean flux approximation when varying
the luminosity of the host star and the eccentricity of the planet. We computed
the climate of tidally locked ocean covered planets with orbital eccentricity
from 0 to 0.9 receiving a mean flux equal to Earth's, around stars of
luminosity ranging from $L_\odot$ to $10^{-4}~L_\odot$. Using here a definition
of habitability based on the presence of surface liquid water, we find that
most of the planets considered can sustain surface liquid water on the dayside
with an ice cap on the nightside. However, for high eccentricity and high
luminosity, planets cannot sustain surface liquid water during the whole
orbital period. They completely freeze at apoastron and when approaching
periastron an ocean appears around the substellar point. We conclude that the
higher the eccentricity and the higher the luminosity of the star, the less
reliable the mean flux approximation.

evolution of a young population with a high degree of primordial multiplicity

unfolding of higher-order (triple) systems; a natural consequence of which is
the formation of wide binaries. We find a strong preference for wide systems to

argue that the majority of wide binaries identified in young moving groups are

origin of light neutrino masses and mixings. If the RHN masses are at or below
the weak scale, direct experimental discovery of these states is possible at
accelerator experiments such as the LHC or new dedicated beam dump experiments;
in such experiments, the RHN decays after traversing a macroscopic distance
from the collision point. The experimental sensitivity to RHNs is significantly
enhanced if there is a new ""dark"" gauge force connecting them to the Standard
Model (SM), and detection of RHNs can be the primary discovery mode for the new
dark force itself. We take the well-motivated example of a B-L gauge symmetry
and analyze the sensitivity to displaced decays of the RHNs produced via the
new gauge interaction in two experiments: the LHC and the proposed SHiP beam
dump experiment. In the most favorable case in which the mediator can be
produced on-shell and decays to RHNs, the sensitivity reach is controlled by
the square of the B-L gauge coupling. We demonstrate that these experiments
could access neutrino parameters responsible for the observed SM neutrino
masses and mixings in the most straightforward implementation of the see-saw
mechanism.

of topological order in two dimensions, capturing the total quantum dimension
of the topological particle content. An extrapolation method on cylinders has
been used frequently to measure the topological entanglement entropy. Here, we
show that a class of short-range entangled 2D states, when put on an infinite
cylinder of circumference $L$, exhibits the entanglement R\'enyi entropy of any
integer index $\alpha \ge 2$ that obeys $S_\alpha = a L - \gamma$ where $a,
\gamma > 0 $. Under the extrapolation method, the subleading term $\gamma$
would be identified as the topological entanglement entropy, which is spurious.
A nonzero $\gamma$ is always present if the 2D state reduces to a certain
symmetry-protected topological 1D state, upon disentangling spins that are far
from the entanglement cut. The internal symmetry that stabilizes $\gamma > 0$
is not necessarily a symmetry of the 2D state, but should be present after the
disentangling reduction. If the symmetry is absent, $\gamma$ decays
exponentially in $L$ with a characteristic length, termed as a replica
correlation length, which can be arbitrarily large compared to the two-point
correlation length of the 2D state. We propose a simple numerical procedure to
measure the replica correlation length through replica correlation functions.
We also calculate the replica correlation functions for representative wave
functions of abelian discrete gauge theories and the double semion theory in
2D, to show that they decay abruptly to zero. This supports a conjecture that
the replica correlation length being small implies that the subleading term
from the extrapolation method determines the total quantum dimension.

magnitude ($M_{K}$) Tully-Fisher relations (TFRs) for sub-samples of the 584
galaxies spatially resolved in H$\alpha$ emission by the KMOS Redshift One
Spectroscopic Survey (KROSS). We model the velocity field of each of the KROSS
galaxies and extract a rotation velocity, $V_{80}$ at a radius equal to the
major axis of an ellipse containing 80% of the total integrated H$\alpha$ flux.
The large sample size of KROSS allowed us to select 210 galaxies with well
measured rotation speeds. We extract from this sample a further 56 galaxies
that are rotationally supported, using the stringent criterion $V_{80}/\sigma >
3$, where $\sigma$ is the flux weighted average velocity dispersion. We find
the $M_{K}$ and $M_{*}$ TFRs for this sub-sample to be $M_{K} / \rm{mag}= (-7.3

zero-point of $-0.41 \pm 0.08$ dex over the last $\sim $8 billion years.
However, we measure no evolution in the $M_{K}$ TFR zero-point over the same

mass had less stellar mass at $z \sim 1$ than the present day, yet emitted the
same amounts of $K$-band light. The ability of KROSS to differentiate, using
integral field spectroscopy with KMOS, between those galaxies that are
rotationally supported and those that are not explains why our findings are at
odds with previous studies without the same capabilities.

reflect the balance between gas pressure and radiation pressure in the ENLR. In
two of the galaxies the ENLR is radiation pressure dominated throughout and the
ionization parameter remains constant (log U ~ 0). In the other two galaxies
radiation pressure is initially important, but gas pressure becomes dominant as
the ionization parameter in the ENLR decreases from log U ~ 0 to -3.4 <= log U
<= -3.2. Where radiation pressure is dominant, the AGN regulates the density of
the interstellar medium on kpc scales and may therefore have a direct impact on
star formation activity and/or the incidence of outflows in the host galaxy to
scales far beyond the zone of influence of the black hole. We find that both
radiation pressure dominated and gas pressure dominated ENLRs are dynamically
active with evidence for outflows, indicating that radiation pressure may be an
important source of AGN feedback even when it is not dominant over the entire

non-superconducting material the induced spectral gap and pairing correlations
are independent physical quantities arising from the proximity effect. This is
a crucial issue in proposals to create topological superconductivity through
the proximity effect. Heterostructures of 3D topological insulator (TI) slabs
on conventional s-wave superconductor (SC) substrates provide a platform, with
proximity-induced topological superconductivity expected to be observed on the
""naked"" top surface of a thin TI slab. We theoretically study the induced
superconducting gap on this naked surface. In addition, we compare against the
induced spectral gap in heterostructures of SC with a normal metal or a
semiconductor with strong spin orbit coupling and a Zeeman splitting potential
(another platform for topological superconductivity). We find that for any
model for the non-SC metal (including metallic TI) the induced spectral gap on
the naked surface decays as $L^{-3}$ as the thickness ($L$) of the non-SC slab
is increased in contrast to the slower $1/L$ decay of the pairing correlations.
Our distinction between proximity-induced spectral gap (with its faster spatial
decay) and pairing correlation (with its slower spatial decay) has important

information through innovative techniques can therefore potentially improve the
cluster detection rate when compared to using only one of the probes. Our aim
is to build such a joint X-ray-SZ analysis tool, which will allow us to detect
fainter or more distant clusters while maintaining high catalogue purity. We
present a method based on matched multifrequency filters (MMF) for extracting
cluster catalogues from SZ and X-ray surveys. We first designed an X-ray
matched-filter method, analogous to the classical MMF developed for SZ
observations. Then, we built our joint X-ray-SZ algorithm by combining our
X-ray matched filter with the classical SZ-MMF, for which we used the physical
relation between SZ and X-ray observations. We show that the proposed X-ray
matched filter provides correct photometry results, and that the joint matched
filter also provides correct photometry when the $F_{\rm X}/Y_{500}$ relation
of the clusters is known. Moreover, the proposed joint algorithm provides a
better signal-to-noise ratio than single-map extractions, which improves the
detection rate even if we do not exactly know the $F_{\rm X}/Y_{500}$ relation.

the Steiner minimal trees (in Gromov-Hausdorff space) with boundaries from this

$3$-point boundary whose points are $3$-point metric spaces such that its
Steiner minimal tree in the Gromov-Hausdorff space is not a minimal filling.
The latter proves that the Steiner subratio of the Gromov-Hausdorff space is
less than 1. The irreducible correspondences enabled us to create a quick

We analyse our AMI data in a fully Bayesian way to produce estimated cluster

Varying pressure profile shape parameters, illustrating an influence of mergers
on scaling relations, induces small deviations from the canonical self-similar
predictions -- in agreement with simulations of Poole et al. 2007 who found
that merger activity causes only small scatter perpendicular to the relations.
We demonstrate this effect observationally using the different dependencies of
SZ and X-ray signals to $n_{\rm e}$ that cause different sensitivities to the
shocking and/or fractionation produced by mergers. Plotting $Y_{\rm
X}$--$M_{\rm gas}$ relations (where $Y_{\rm X}=M_{\rm gas}T$) derived from AMI
SZ and from $Chandra$ X-ray gives ratios of AMI and $Chandra$ $Y_{\rm X}$ and
$M_{\rm gas}$ estimates that indicate movement of clusters \textit{along} the
scaling relation, as predicted by Poole et al. 2007. Clusters that have moved
most along the relation have the most discrepant $T_{\rm SZ}$ and $T_{\rm X}$
estimates: all the other clusters (apart from one) have SZ and X-ray estimates

together with the shape and derived properties from the SED was used to
determine each system's coevality as accurately as possible. SED models were
used to examine the frequency of non-coevality that is due to geometry. We find
a non-coevality frequency of 33+/-10% from the comparison of SED shapes of
resolved multiple systems. Other source parameters suggest a somewhat lower
frequency of non-coevality. The frequency of apparent non-coevality that is due
to random inclination angle pairings of model SEDs is 17+/-0.5%. Observations
of the outflow of resolved multiple systems do not suggest significant
misalignments within multiple systems. Effects of unresolved multiples on the
SED shape are also investigated. We find that 1/3 of the multiple protostellar

geometric orientations. The other 2/3 are found to be coeval. Higher order
multiples show a tendency to be non-coeval. The frequency of non-coevality
found here is most likely due to formation and enhanced by dynamical evolution.

a position-sensitive detector probed by tracks. It calculates the resolution
solely from measured track data without using a detailed tracking simulation
and without considering multiple Coulomb scattering effects. Two separate
linear track fits are performed on the same data, one excluding and the other
including the hit from the probed detector. The geometric mean of the widths of
the corresponding exclusive and inclusive residual distributions for the probed
detector is then taken as a measure of the intrinsic spatial resolution of the
probed detector: $\sigma=\sqrt{\sigma_{ex}\cdot\sigma_{in}}$. The validity of
this method is examined for a range of resolutions with a stand-alone Geant4
Monte Carlo simulation that specifically takes multiple Coulomb scattering in
the tracking detector materials into account. Using simulated as well as actual
tracking data from a representative beam test scenario, we find that the
geometric-mean method gives systematically inaccurate spatial resolution
results. Good resolutions are estimated as poor and vice versa. The more the
resolutions of reference detectors and probed detector differ, the larger the
systematic bias. An attempt to correct this inaccuracy by statistically
subtracting multiple-scattering effects from geometric-mean results leads to
resolutions that are typically too optimistic by 10-50\%. This supports an
earlier critique of this method based on simulation studies that did not take
multiple scattering into account.

flagella or cilia to swim in a fluid, while many other micro-organisms instead
use ample shape deformation, described as amoeboid, to propel themselves by
either crawling on a substrate or swimming. Many eukaryotic cells were believed
to require an underlying substratum to migrate (crawl) by using membrane
deformation (like blebbing or generation of lamellipodia) but there is now
increasing evidence that a large variety of cells (including those of the
immune system) can migrate without the assistance of focal adhesion, allowing
them to swim as efficiently as they can crawl. This paper details the analysis
of amoeboid swimming in a confined fluid by modeling the swimmer as an
inextensible membrane deploying local active forces. The swimmer displays a
rich behavior: it may settle into a straight trajectory in the channel or
navigate from one wall to the other depending on its confinement. The nature of
the swimmer is also found to be affected by confinement: the swimmer can
behave, on the average over one swimming cycle, as a pusher at low confinement,
and becomes a puller at higher confinement. The swimmer's nature is thus not an
intrinsic property. The scaling of the swimmer velocity V with the force
amplitude A is analyzed in detail showing that at small enough A, $V\sim
A^2/\eta^2$, whereas at large enough A, V is independent of the force and is
determined solely by the stroke frequency and swimmer size. This finding
starkly contrasts with currently known results found from swimming models where
motion is based on flagellar or ciliary activity, where $V\sim A/\eta$. To
conclude, two definitions of efficiency as put forward in the literature are
analyzed with distinct outcomes. We find that one type of efficiency has an
optimum as a function of confinement while the other does not. Future
perspectives are outlined.

approximations for the optimal timing when the parameters correspond to the
rates for different network events. We find that the optimal time depends the
most on the network processes with short expected durations and few expected
events such as the dissolution of ties. We apply our approximations to a simple
example of a dynamic network with formation and dissolution of iid ties.

(SNe) by analyzing their bolometric light curves. Bolometric light curves of
Type Ibn SNe generally have a large contrast between peak luminosity and
late-phase luminosity, which is much larger than those of 56Ni-powered SNe.
Thus, most of them are likely powered by the interaction between SN ejecta and
dense circumstellar media. In addition, Type Ibn SNe decline much faster than
Type IIn SNe, and this indicates that the interaction in Type Ibn SNe ceases
earlier than in Type IIn SNe. Thus, we argue that Type Ibn SN progenitors
experience high mass-loss rates in a short period just before explosion, while
Type IIn SN progenitors have high mass-loss rates sustained for a long time.
Furthermore, we show that rise time and peak luminosity of Type Ibn and Type
IIn SNe are similar and thus, they have similar explosion properties and
circumstellar density. The similar circumstellar density in the two kinds of
SNe may indicate that mass-loss rates of Type Ibn SN progenitors are generally
higher than those of Type IIn as the wind velocities inferred from narrow
spectral components are generally higher in Type Ibn SNe. We also show that
56Ni mass and explosion energy of Type Ibn SNe may be smaller than those of
other stripped-envelope SNe, probably because they tend to suffer large
fallback or some of them may not even be terminal stellar explosions.

  Intersection Problem of Erd\H{o}s and S\'os","39 pages. Minor expositional changes",,,,"math.CO math.PR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  A family $F$ of sets is said to be $t$-intersecting if $|A \cap B| \geq t$
for any $A,B \in F$. The seminal Complete Intersection Theorem of Ahlswede and
Khachatrian (1997) gives the maximal size $f(n,k,t)$ of a $t$-intersecting
family of $k$-element subsets of $[n]=\{1,2,\ldots,n\}$, together with a
characterisation of the extremal families.
  The forbidden intersection problem, posed by Erd\H{o}s and S\'{o}s in 1971,
asks for a determination of the maximal size $g(n,k,t)$ of a family $F$ of
$k$-element subsets of $[n]$ such that $|A \cap B| \neq t-1$ for any $A,B \in
F$.
  In this paper, we show that for any fixed $t \in \mathbb{N}$, if $o(n) \leq k
\leq n/2-o(n)$, then $g(n,k,t)=f(n,k,t)$. In combination with prior results,
this solves the above problem of Erd\H{o}s and S\'{o}s for any constant $t$,
except for in the ranges $n/2-o(n) < k < n/2+t/2$ and $k < 2t$.
  One key ingredient of the proof is the following sharp `stability' result for
the Complete Intersection Theorem: if $k/n$ is bounded away from $0$ and $1/2$,
and $F$ is a $t$-intersecting family of $k$-element subsets of $[n]$ such that
$|F| \geq f(n,k,t) - O(\binom{n-d}{k})$, then there exists a family $G$ such
that $G$ is extremal for the Complete Intersection Theorem, and $|F \setminus
G| = O(\binom{n-d}{k-d})$. We believe this result to be of interest in its own
right; indeed, it proves a conjecture of Friedgut from 2008. We prove it by
combining classical `shifting' arguments with a `bootstrapping' method based
upon an isoperimetric inequality.
  Another key ingredient is a `weak regularity lemma' for families of
$k$-element subsets of $[n]$, where $k/n$ is bounded away from 0 and 1. This
states that any such family $F$ is approximately contained within a `junta',
such that the restriction of $F$ to each subcube determined by the junta is
`pseudorandom' in a certain sense.

surveys such as the Dark Energy Survey (DES) and the Large Synoptic Survey

resources are limited, so in the absence of real-time SN spectra these surveys
must rely on host galaxy spectra to obtain accurate redshifts for the Hubble
diagram and to improve photometric classification of SNe. In addition, SN
luminosities are known to correlate with host-galaxy properties. Therefore,
reliable identification of host galaxies is essential for cosmology and SN
science. We simulate SN events and their locations within their host galaxies
to develop and test methods for matching SNe to their hosts. We use both real
and simulated galaxy catalog data from the Advanced Camera for Surveys General
Catalog and MICECATv2.0, respectively. We also incorporate ""hostless"" SNe
residing in undetected faint hosts into our analysis, with an assumed hostless
rate of 5%. Our fully automated algorithm is run on catalog data and matches
SNe to their hosts with 91% accuracy. We find that including a machine learning
component, run after the initial matching algorithm, improves the accuracy
(purity) of the matching to 97% with a 2% cost in efficiency (true positive
rate). Although the exact results are dependent on the details of the survey
and the galaxy catalogs used, the method of identifying host galaxies we
outline here can be applied to any transient survey.

17,230 targets for which at least one transit signature is identified that
meets the specified detection criteria: periodicity, minimum of three observed
transit events, detection statistic (i.e., signal-to-noise ratio) in excess of
the search threshold, and passing grade on three statistical transit
consistency tests. Light curves for which a transit signal is identified are
iteratively searched for additional signatures after a limb-darkened transiting
planet model is fitted to the data and transit events are removed. The search
for additional planets adds 16,802 transit signals for a total of 34,032; this
far exceeds the number of transit signatures identified in prior pipeline runs.
There was a strategic emphasis on completeness over reliability for the final
Kepler transit search. A comparison of the transit signals against a set of
3402 well-established, high-quality Kepler Objects of Interest yields a
recovery rate of 99.8%. The high recovery rate must be weighed against a large
number of false-alarm detections. We examine characteristics of the planet
population implied by the transiting planet model fits with an emphasis on
detections that would represent small planets orbiting in the habitable zone of
their host stars.

that the only information on the eavesdropper available at the source is her

beamforming solution, showing how the path to optimality remains the same.
Finally, we investigate the impact of location uncertainty on the secrecy
outage probability, showing how our solution can still allow for secrecy even
when the source only has a noisy estimate of the eavesdropper's location. Our
work demonstrates how a multi-antenna array, operating in the most general

where vehicles arrive according to a spatio-temporal Poisson process, and
depart after traveling a distance that is sampled independently and identically
from a spatial distribution. When inside the queue, the speed of a vehicle is
proportional to a power $m >0$ of the distance to the vehicle in front. The
service rate of HTQ is equal to the sum of the speeds of the vehicles, and has
a complex dependency on the state (vehicle locations) of the system. We show
that the service-rate increases (resp., decreases) in between arrivals and
departures for $m<1$ (resp., $m>1$) case. For a given initial condition, we
define the throughput of such a queue as the largest arrival rate under which
the queue length remains bounded. We extend the busy period calculations for

Submitted for publication",,,,"cs.IT cs.NI math.IT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We propose a cellular architecture that combines multiuser MIMO (MU-MIMO)
downlink with opportunistic use of unlicensed ISM bands to establish
device-to-device (D2D) cooperation. The architecture consists of a
physical-layer cooperation scheme based on forming downlink virtual MIMO
channels through D2D relaying, and a novel resource allocation strategy for
such D2D-enabled networks. We prove the approximate optimality of the
physical-layer scheme, and demonstrate that such cooperation boosts the
effective SNR of the weakest user in the system, especially in the many-user
regime, due to multiuser diversity. To harness this physical-layer scheme, we
formulate the cooperative user scheduling and relay selection problem using the
network utility maximization framework. For such a cooperative network, we
propose a novel utility metric that jointly captures fairness in throughput and
the cost of relaying in the system. We propose a joint user scheduling and
relay selection algorithm, which we prove to be asymptotically optimal. We
study the architecture through system-level simulations over a wide range of
scenarios. The highlight of these simulations is an approximately $6$x
improvement in data rate for cell-edge (bottom fifth-percentile) users (over
the state-of-the-art SU-MIMO) while still improving the overall throughput, and
taking into account various system constraints.

neural network in embedded systems is a challenging task, because a typical
deep neural network, such as a Deep Belief Network using 128x128 images as

bottleneck. To address this challenge, this paper presents a hardware-oriented
deep learning algorithm, named as the Deep Adaptive Network, which attempts to
exploit the sparsity in the neural connections. The proposed method adaptively
reduces the weights associated with negligible features to zero, leading to
sparse feedforward network architecture. Furthermore, since the small
proportion of important weights are significantly larger than zero, they can be
robustly thresholded and represented using single-bit integers (-1 and +1),
leading to implementations of deep neural networks with sparse and binary
connections. Our experiments showed that, for the application of recognizing
MNIST handwritten digits, the features extracted by a two-layer Deep Adaptive
Network with about 25% reserved important connections achieved 97.2%
classification accuracy, which was almost the same with the standard Deep
Belief Network (97.3%). Furthermore, for efficient hardware implementations,
the sparse-and-binary-weighted deep neural network could save about 99.3%

accuracy for pattern recognition applications.

whose solution corresponds to the computation of $\mathcal{S}(L(p,1))$. We
start from the Lambropoulou invariant $X$ for knots and links in ST, the
universal analogue of the Homflypt polynomial in ST, and a new basis,
$\Lambda$, of $\mathcal{S}({\rm ST})$ presented in \cite{DL1}. We show that
$\mathcal{S}(L(p,1))$ is obtained from $\mathcal{S}({\rm ST})$ by considering
relations coming from the performance of braid band moves (bbm) on elements in
the basis $\Lambda$, where the braid band moves are performed on any moving
strand of each element in $\Lambda$. We do that by proving that the system of
equations obtained from diagrams in ST by performing bbm on any moving strand
is equivalent to the system obtained if we only consider elements in the basic
set $\Lambda$.
  The importance of our approach is that it can shed light to the problem of
computing skein modules of arbitrary c.c.o. $3$-manifolds, since any
$3$-manifold can be obtained by surgery on $S^3$ along unknotted closed curves.
The main difficulty of the problem lies in selecting from the infinitum of band
moves some basic ones and solving the infinite system of equations.

comparison to other materials. One of the most useful is the high degree of
toughness that can be achieved due to significant yield occurring in the

poorly quantified, despite its importance as the ultimate limit of purely
elastic behavior. Here we report the results of a novel experiment which is
extremely sensitive to the onset of yield and discuss its impact on measurement
and elastic theory. In particular, we use an elastic instability to locally
bend and impart a \textit{local} tensile stress in a thin, glassy polystyrene
film, and directly measure the resulting residual stress caused by the bending.
We show that plastic failure is initiated at extremely low strains, of order
$10^{-3}$ for polystyrene. Not only is this critical strain found to be small
in comparison to bulk measurement, we show that it is influenced by thin film
confinement - leading to an increase in the critical strain for plastic failure
as film thickness approaches zero.

O(sqrt(n)) memory to train a n layer network, with only the computational cost
of an extra forward pass per mini-batch. As many of the state-of-the-art models
hit the upper bound of the GPU memory, our algorithm allows deeper and more

intermediate feature maps and gradients during training. Computation graph
analysis is used for automatic in-place operation and memory sharing
optimizations. We show that it is possible to trade computation for memory -
giving a more memory efficient training algorithm with a little extra
computation cost. In the extreme case, our analysis also shows that the memory
consumption can be reduced to O(log n) with as little as O(n log n) extra cost
for forward computation. Our experiments show that we can reduce the memory

$G$ if every node in $V(G)\backslash C$ is adjacent with at least $m$ nodes in

62.3 by a large amount for the $(3,m)$-CDS problem on a unit disk graph.

had focused primarily on the classification of pre-segmented (i.e., trimmed)
videos, which is an artificial task. In THUMOS 2014, we elevated action
recognition to a more practical level by introducing temporally untrimmed
videos. These also include `background videos' which share similar scenes and
backgrounds as action videos, but are devoid of the specific actions. The three
editions of the challenge organized in 2013--2015 have made THUMOS a common
benchmark for action classification and detection and the annual challenge is
widely attended by teams from around the world.
  In this paper we describe the THUMOS benchmark in detail and give an overview
of data collection and annotation procedures. We present the evaluation
protocols used to quantify results in the two THUMOS tasks of action
classification and temporal detection. We also present results of submissions
to the THUMOS 2015 challenge and review the participating approaches.
Additionally, we include a comprehensive empirical study evaluating the
differences in action recognition between trimmed and untrimmed videos, and how
well methods trained on trimmed videos generalize to untrimmed videos. We
conclude by proposing several directions and improvements for future THUMOS
challenges.

interconversion principles, are still an open debate. We have found theoretical
evidence that a single photon packet is capable of extracting work from a
single two-level system (TLS). More importantly, this effect is found for a
photon as it is spontaneously emitted, therefore carrying only heat away from
the emitter. This is the most elementary process in which heat is converted
into work, requiring not more than two off-resonance atoms for that purpose.
From a more practical point of view it is found that, surprisingly, work can be
extracted from a TLS in a completely passive initial state. The process is
cyclic in the sense that the TLS initial and final states are equal. The state
of the TLS remains passive throughout the interaction time with the
single-photon packet. The physical meaning of the work performed by the TLS is
found to be a dynamical change in the color of the photon during the reemission
process. All our predictions are, in principle, measurable within
state-of-the-art experiments.

within this sample are high luminosity quasars with a mean bolometric
luminosity of $10^{46.4}$ erg s$^{-1}$. The redshift range of this sample is
within $z<4$, with a mean value of $1.5\pm0.78$. Because we only selected
quasars that have been detected in all three Herschel-SPIRE bands, the quasar
sample is complete yet highly biased. Based on the multi-wavelength photometric
observation data, we conducted a spectral energy distribution (SED) fitting
through UV to FIR. Parameters such as active galactic nucleus (AGN) luminosity,
FIR luminosity, stellar mass, as well as many other AGN and galaxy properties
are deduced from the SED fitting results. The mean star formation rate (SFR) of
the sample is 419 $M_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$ and the mean gas mass is $\sim
10^{11.3}$ $M_{\odot}$. All these results point to an IR luminous quasar
system. Comparing with star formation main sequence (MS) galaxies, at least 80
out of 207 quasars are hosted by starburst galaxies. It supports the statement
that luminous AGNs are more likely to be associated with major mergers. The SFR
increases with the redshift up to $z=2$. It is correlated with the AGN
bolometric luminosity, where $L_{\rm FIR} \propto L_{\rm Bol}^{0.46\pm0.03}$.
The AGN bolometric luminosity is also correlated with the host galaxy mass and
gas mass. Yet the correlation between $L_{\rm FIR}$ and $L_{\rm Bol}$ has
higher significant level, implies that the link between AGN accretion and the
SFR is more primal. The $M_{\rm BH}/M_{\ast}$ ratio of our sample is 0.02,
higher than the value 0.005 in the local Universe. It might indicate an
evolutionary trend of the $M_{\rm BH} - M_{\ast}$ scaling relation.

from errors, and as a result, the error-correcting capability of the code is
diminished. Prior studies have proposed two different schemes as a solu- tion.
One uses only one QECC to correct errors on the receiver's side (i.e., Bob) and

progenitors of high-mass young stars and clusters relies on a variety of
independent diagnostics based on observables from the near-infrared to the
radio. A promising evolutionary indicator for massive and dense
cluster-progenitor clumps is the L/M ratio between the bolometric luminosity
and the mass of the clumps. With the aim of providing a quantitative
calibration for this indicator we used SEPIA/APEX to obtain CH3C2H(12-11)
observations, that is an excellent thermometer molecule probing densities >
10^5 cm^-3 , toward 51 dense clumps with M>1000 solar masses, and uniformly
spanning -2 < Log(L/M) < 2.3.
  We identify three distinct ranges of L/M that can be associated to three
distinct phases of star formation in massive clumps. For L/M <1 no clump is
detected in CH3C2H , suggesting an inner envelope temperature below 30K. For 1<
L/M < 10 we detect 58% of the clumps, with a temperature between 30 and 35 K
independently from the exact value of L/M; such clumps are building up
luminosity due to the formation of stars, but no star is yet able to
significantly heat the inner clump regions. For L/M> 10 we detect all the
clumps, with a gas temperature rising with Log(L/M), marking the appearance of
a qualitatively different heating source within the clumps; such values are
found towards clumps with UCHII counterparts, suggesting that the quantitative
difference in T - L/M behaviour above L/M >10 is due to the first appearance of
ZAMS stars in the clumps.

asymptotic freedom. As one step in our computation of the $\Lambda$-parameter

us to non-perturbatively reach very high energies, corresponding to $\alpha_s =

there, yielding a three percent error in the $\Lambda$-parameter, while data
around $\alpha_s \approx 0.2$ is clearly insufficient to quote such a

the complete story for understanding and inferring the preferences of people.
First, peoples' preferences and their observable manifestations as ratings
evolve over time along general patterns of trajectories. Second, an individual
person's preferences evolve over time through influence of their social
connections. In this paper, we develop a unified process model for both types
of dynamics within a state space approach, together with an efficient
optimization scheme for estimation within that model. The model combines
elements from recent developments in dynamic matrix factorization, opinion
dynamics and social learning, and trust-based recommendation. The estimation
builds upon recent advances in numerical nonlinear optimization. Empirical

consistent reduction in root mean squared error by consideration of the two

Reality (AR), Virtual Reality (VR) and wearable devices, the need for a hand
based input mechanism is becoming essential in order to make the experience
natural, seamless and immersive. Hand pose estimation has progressed
drastically in recent years due to the introduction of commodity depth cameras.
  Hand pose estimation based on vision is still a challenging problem due to
its complexity from self-occlusion (between fingers), close similarity between
fingers, dexterity of the hands, speed of the pose and the high dimension of
the hand kinematic parameters. Articulated hand pose estimation is still an
open problem and under intensive research from both academia and industry.
  The 2 approaches used for hand pose estimation are: discriminative and
generative. Generative approach is a model based that tries to fit a hand model
to the observed data. Discriminative approach is appearance based, usually
implemented with machine learning (ML) and require a large amount of training
data. Recent hand pose estimation uses hybrid approach by combining both
discriminative and generative methods into a single hand pipeline.
  In this paper, we focus on reviewing recent progress of hand pose estimation
from depth sensor. We will survey discriminative methods, generative methods
and hybrid methods. This paper is not a comprehensive review of all hand pose
estimation techniques, it is a subset of some of the recent state-of-the-art

effective approach to achieve O(N^2) degrees of freedom (DoF) with an antenna
array of N antennas. Such DoF refers to the number of directions of incoming
signals that can be resolved. With the increased number of DoF, an important
application of nested array is to nullify the interference signals from
multiple directions. In this paper, we apply nested array in a massive MIMO
heterogeneous network (HetNet) for interference management. With nested array
based interference nulling, each base station (BS) can nullify a certain number
of interference signals. A key design issue is to select the interference
sources to be nullified at each BS. We formulate this problem as an integer
programming problem. The objective is to maximize the sum rate of all users,
subject to BS DoF constraints. We propose an approximation scheme to solve this
problem and derive a performance upper bound. Simulation results show that the
proposed scheme effectively improves the sum rate and achieves a near optimal
performance.

universal relations between the superfluid density at zero temperature, the
transition temperature, and the electric DC conductivity right above the

Energy Camera at the 4-m Blanco telescope at CTIO. We find clear evidence of
stellar substructure associated with the galaxy, extending to a distance of
$82\arcmin$ (2\,kpc) from its centre. We perform a statistical analysis of the
over-densities and find three distinct features, as well as an extended
halo-like structure, to be significant at the $99.7\%$ confidence level or
higher. Unlike the extremely elongated and extended substructures surrounding
the Hercules dwarf spheroidal galaxy, the over-densities seen around Sextans
are distributed evenly about its centre, and do not appear to form noticeable
tidal tails. Fitting a King model to the radial distribution of Sextans stars
yields a tidal radius $r_t =83.2\arcmin\pm7.1\arcmin$ (2.08$\pm$0.18\,kpc),
which implies the majority of detected substructure is gravitationally bound to
the galaxy. This finding suggests that Sextans is not undergoing significant
tidal disruption from the Milky Way, supporting the scenario in which the orbit
of Sextans has a low eccentricity.

super-Eddington accreting massive black holes (SEAMBHs) in active galactic
nuclei (AGNs) between 2014-2015. Ten new targets were selected from quasar
sample of Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS), which are generally more luminous
than the SEAMBH candidates in last two years. H$\beta$ lags ($\tau_{_{\rm
H\beta}}$) in five of the 10 quasars have been successfully measured in this
monitoring season. We find that the lags are generally shorter, by large
factors, than those of objects with same optical luminosity, in light of the
well-known $R_{_{\rm H\beta}}-L_{5100}$ relation. The five quasars have
dimensionless accretion rates of $\dot{\mathscr{M}}=10-10^3$. Combining
measurements of the previous SEAMBHs, we find that the reduction of H$\beta$
lags tightly depends on accretion rates, $\tau_{_{\rm
H\beta}}/\tau_{_{R-L}}\propto\dot{\mathscr{M}}^{-0.42}$, where $\tau_{_{R-L}}$
is the H$\beta$ lag from the normal $R_{_{\rm H\beta}}-L_{5100}$ relation.
Fitting 63 mapped AGNs, we present a new scaling relation for the broad-line
region: $R_{_{\rm
H\beta}}=\alpha_1\ell_{44}^{\beta_1}\,\min\left[1,\left(\dot{\mathscr{M}}/\dot{\mathscr{M}}_c\right)^{-\gamma_1}\right]$,
where $\ell_{44}=L_{5100}/10^{44}\,\rm erg~s^{-1}$ is 5100 \AA\ continuum
luminosity, and coefficients of $\alpha_1=(29.6_{-2.8}^{+2.7})$ lt-d,
$\beta_1=0.56_{-0.03}^{+0.03}$, $\gamma_1=0.52_{-0.16}^{+0.33}$ and
$\dot{\mathscr{M}}_c=11.19_{-6.22}^{+2.29}$. This relation is applicable to
AGNs over a wide range of accretion rates, from $10^{-3}$ to $10^3$.

electrically insulating and delicate and have proven very challenging to probe
with conventional methods. Using a unique pulsed tunneling method capable of

determine the sign/phase of superconducting order parameter, as it is closely
related to the pairing interaction. In conventional superconductors, the
electron-phonon interaction induces attraction between electrons near the Fermi
energy and results in a sign-preserved s-wave pairing. For high-temperature
superconductors, including cuprates and iron-based superconductors, prevalent
weak coupling theories suggest that the electron pairing is mediated by spin
fluctuations which lead to repulsive interactions, and therefore that a
sign-reversed pairing with an s+-or d-wave symmetry is favored. Here, by using
magnetic neutron scattering, a phase sensitive probe of superconducting gap, we
report the observation of a transition from the sign-reversed to sign-preserved
Cooper-pairing symmetry with insignificant changes in Tc in the S-doped iron
selenide superconductors KxFe2-y(Se1-zSz)2. We show that a rather sharp
magnetic resonant mode well below the superconducting gap (2delta) in the
undoped sample (z = 0) is replaced by a broad hump structure above 2delta under
50% S doping. These results cannot be readily explained by simple spin
fluctuation-exchange pairing theories and, therefore, multiple pairing channels
are required to describe superconductivity in this system. Our findings may
also yield a simple explanation for the sometimes contradictory data on the
sign of the superconducting order parameter in iron-based materials.

disconnected clusters of the high density phase exhibit ballistic motion, the

from nearly circular shapes, at the time of nucleation, these clusters grow via

crystalline order. Standard self-similarity in the domain pattern, typically
observed in kinetics of phase transitions, is found to be absent in this growth
process. This invalidates the common method, that provides a growth law same as

time is a fundamental part of modern astrophysics. In order to study this
evolution it is important to sample the galaxies at various times in a
consistent way through time. In regular luminosity selected samples, our
analyses are biased towards the brightest galaxies at all times (as these are
easier to observe and identify). A complementary method relies on the
absorption imprint from neutral gas in galaxies, the so-called damped Ly-alpha
absorbers (DLAs) seen towards distant bright objects. This thesis seeks to
understand how the absorption selected galaxies relate to the emission selected
galaxies by identifying the faint glow from the absorbing galaxies at redshift
z~2.
  In the last Chapter, a study of the more evolved, massive galaxies is
presented. These galaxies are observed to be a factor of 2 to 6 times smaller
than local galaxies of similar masses. A new spectroscopically selected sample
is presented and the increased precision of the redshifts allows a more
detailed measurement of the scatter in the mass-size relation. The size
evolution of massive, quiescent galaxies is modelled by a `dilution' scenario,
in which progressively larger galaxies at later times are added to the
population of denser galaxies, causing an increase of the mean size of the
population. This model describes the evolution of both sizes and number
densities very well, however, the scatter in the model increases with time,
contrary to the data. It is thus concluded that a combination of `dilution' and
individual growth, e.g., through mergers, is needed.
  For brevity, the individual chapters based on published peer-reviewed
articles are omitted and a link to the given article is given instead.

a core module of automated mapping. When computational power represents a
limited resource and, a detailed map is not the primary goal, the
reconstruction can be performed incrementally, from a monocular video, carving
a 3D Delaunay triangulation of sparse points; this allows online incremental
mapping for tasks such as traversability analysis or obstacle avoidance. To
exploit the sharp edges of urban landscape, we propose to use a Delaunay
triangulation of Edge-Points, which are the 3D points corresponding to image
edges. These points constrain the edges of the 3D Delaunay triangulation to
real-world edges. Besides the use of the Edge-Points, a second contribution of
this paper is the Inverse Cone Heuristic that preemptively avoids the creation
of artifacts in the reconstructed manifold surface. We force the reconstruction
of a manifold surface since it makes it possible to apply computer graphics or
photometric refinement algorithms to the output mesh. We evaluated our approach
on four real sequences of the public available KITTI dataset by comparing the
incremental reconstruction against Velodyne measurements.

efficiently computing the Fourier transform of finite-length signals, whenever
the time or frequency grid is nonuniformly spaced. Following the usual
classification, there exist five NFFT types. Types 1 and 2 make it possible to
pass from the time to the frequency domain with nonuniform input and output
grids respectively. Type 3 allows for both input and output nonuniform grids.
Finally, types 4 and 5 are the inverses of types 1 and 2 and are expensive
computationally, given that they involve iterative methods. In this paper, we
solve this last drawback in the one-dimensional case by presenting
non-iterative type 4 and 5 NFFT methods that just involve three NFFTs of types
1 or 2 plus some additional FFTs. The methods are based on exploiting the

galaxy DDO 68, based on our photometry with the Advanced Camera for Surveys.
With a metallicity of only $12+\log(O/H)=7.15$ and a very isolated location,
DDO 68 is one of the most metal-poor galaxies known. It has been argued that
DDO 68 is a young system that started forming stars only $\sim 0.15$ Gyr ago.
Our data provide a deep and uncontaminated optical color-magnitude diagram that
allows us to disprove this hypothesis, since we find a population of at least
$\sim 1$ Gyr old stars. The star formation activity has been fairly continuous
over all the look-back time. The current rate is quite low, and the highest
activity occurred between 10 and 100 Myr ago. The average star formation rate
over the whole Hubble time is $\simeq 0.01$ M$_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$,
corresponding to a total astrated mass of $\simeq 1.3 \times 10^8$ M$_{\odot}$.
Our photometry allows us to infer the distance from the tip of the red giant
branch, $D = 12.08 \pm 0.67$ Mpc; however, to let our synthetic color-magnitude
diagram reproduce the observed ones we need a slightly higher distance,
$D=12.65$ Mpc, or $(m-M)_0 = 30.51$, still inside the errors of the previous
determination, and we adopt the latter. DDO 68 shows a very interesting and
complex history, with its quite disturbed shape and a long Tail probably due to
tidal interactions. The star formation history of the Tail differs from that of
the main body mainly for an enhanced activity at recent epochs, likely
triggered by the interaction.

the plasma number density profiles obtained from the polarization data for the
Vela and the gamma-ray millisecond pulsars J1446-4701, J1939+2134 and
J1744-1134 are presented. The number densities derived tend to be the
highest/lowest when the radio pulse leads/lags the gamma-ray peak. In the PSR
J1939+2134, the plasma density profiles for the main pulse and interpulse
appear to fit exactly the same curve, testifying to the origin of both radio
components above the same magnetic pole and their propagation through the same
plasma flow in opposite directions. The millisecond radio pulse components
exhibiting flat position angle curves are suggested to result from the induced
scattering of the main pulse by the same particles that generate gamma-rays.
This is believed to underlie the wide-sense radio/gamma-ray correlation in the
millisecond pulsars. The radio quietness of young gamma-ray pulsars is
attributed to resonant absorption, whereas the radio loudness to the radio beam
escape through the periphery of the open field line tube.

evaluate the expectation values (VEVs) of the electric field squared and of the

extracted. In this way, for points away from the shell, the renormalization is
reduced to the one for the VEVs in the boundary-free dS bulk. As a special
case, the VEVs are obtained for a cylindrical shell in the $(D+1)$%

The corresponding Casimir-Polder forces are directed toward the shell. The
vacuum energy-momentum tensor, in addition to the diagonal components, has a
nonzero off-diagonal component corresponding to the energy flux along the
direction normal to the shell. This flux is directed from the shell in both the
exterior and interior regions. For points near the shell, the leading terms in
the asymptotic expansions for the electric field squared and diagonal
components of the energy-momentum tensor are obtained from the corresponding
expressions in the Minkowski bulk replacing the distance from the shell by the
proper distance in the dS bulk. The influence of the gravitational field on the
local characteristics of the vacuum is essential at distances from the shell
larger than the dS curvature radius. The results are extended for confining

their quotient: the tangent module to the miniversal deformation. In

We demonstrate that the generalized magneto-optical conductivity of graphene on
the harmonics of a strong pump laser radiation has a characteristic Hall
plateaus feature. The plateaus heights depend on the laser intensity and
broadening of Landau levels, so that are not quantized exactly. This nonlinear
effect remains robust against the significant broadening of Landau levels. We
predict realization of an experiment through the observation of the third

graphene, one common practice is through chemical doping. While a gap may me
opened in this way, disorder-induced scattering is an unwanted side-effect that
impacts the electron mobility in the conductive regime of the system. However,
this undesirable side effect is known to be minimised if dopants interact
asymmetrically with the two sublattices of graphene. In this work we propose
that mechanical strain can be used to introduce such a sublattice asymmetry in
the doping process of graphene. We argue that a localised out-of-plane
deformation applied to a graphene sheet can make one of the graphene
sublattices more energetically favourable for impurity adsorption than the
other and that this can be controlled by varying the strain parameters. Two
complementary modelling schemes are used to describe the electronic structure
of the flat and deformed graphene sheets: a tight-binding model and density
functional theory. Our results indicate a novel way to select the doping
process of graphene through strain engineering.

allows to formulate a manifestly step-by-step Weyl gauge invariant theory and
to emphasize some fundamental aspects of group theory in the demonstration. No
relativistic quantum field operators are used and the particle exchange

elementary particles. It is therefore this property, not considered in the
Standard Quantum Mechanics, which determines the correct spin-statistics

and uncrosslinked actin filaments in a supercritical solution of free monomers
pressing against a mobile wall. The filaments are anchored normally to a fixed
planar surface at one of their ends and, because of their limited flexibility,
they grow almost parallel to each other. Their growing ends hit a moving
obstacle, depicted as a second planar wall, parallel to the previous one and
subjected to a harmonic compressive force. The force constant is denoted as
trap strength while the distance between the two walls as trap length to make
contact with the experimental optical trap apparatus. For an ideal solution of
reactive filaments and free monomers at fixed free monomers chemical potential,
we obtain the general expression for the grand potential from which we derive
averages and distributions of relevant physical quantities, namely the obstacle
position, the bundle polymerization force and the number of filaments in direct
contact with the wall. The grafted living filaments are modeled as discrete
Wormlike chains, with Factin persistence length, subject to discrete contour
length variations to model single monomer (de)polymerization steps. Rigid
filaments, either isolated or in bundles, all provide average values of the
stalling force in agreement with Hill's predictions, independent of the average
trap length. Flexible filaments instead, for values of the trap strength
suitable to prevent their lateral escape, provide an average bundle force and
an average trap length slightly larger than the corresponding rigid cases (few
percents). Still the stalling force remains nearly independent on the average
trap length, but results from the product of two strongly L dependent
contributions: the fraction of touching filaments and the single filament
buckling force.

high energy physics experiments poses a major challenge to readout systems. At
high collision rates, e.g. at LHC experiments, only a small fraction of data
can be read out with currently used technologies. To cope with the requirements
of future or upgraded experiments new data transfer techniques are required
which offer high data rates at low power and low material budget. Wireless
technologies operating in the 60 GHz band or at higher frequencies offer high
data rates and are thus a promising upcoming alternative to conventional data
transmission via electrical cables or optical fibers. Using wireless
technology, the amount of cables and connectors in detectors can be
significantly reduced. Tracking detectors profit most from a reduced material
budget as fewer secondary particle interactions (multiple Coulomb scattering,
energy loss, etc.) improve the tracking performance in general. We present
feasibility studies regarding the integration of the wireless technology at 60
GHz into a silicon tracking detector. Spare silicon strip modules of the ATLAS
experiment are measured to be opaque in the 60 GHz range. The reduction of
cross talk between links is studied. An estimate of the maximum achievable link
density is given. It is shown that wireless links can be placed as close as 2
cm next to each other for a layer distance of 10 cm by exploiting one or
several of the following measures: highly directive antennas, absorbers, linear
polarization and frequency channeling. Combining these measures, a data rate
area density of up to 11 Tb/(s $\cdot$ m$^2$) seems feasible. In addition, two
types of silicon sensors are tested under mm-wave irradiation . No

important role in the formation of social networks and is in general not
symmetric between persons. In this paper, we study the dynamics of initiative
by analysing and modeling a detailed call and text message network sampled from
a group of 700 individuals. We show that in an average relationship between two
individuals, one part is almost twice as likely to initiate communication
compared to the other part. The asymmetry has social consequences and
ultimately might lead to the discontinuation of a relationship. We explain the
observed asymmetry by a positive feedback mechanism where individuals already
taking initiative are more likely to take initiative in the future. In general,
people with many initiatives receive attention from a broader spectrum of
friends than people with few initiatives. Lastly, we compare the likelihood of
taking initiative with the basic personality traits of the five factor model.

this paper, we propose to address the challenge by learning a latent matching

the spatial manifold $\mathbb{R}^2 \times S^1 (\beta)$. We illustrate this
approach by calculating the pressure of a relativistic Bose and Fermi gas and
reproduce the known results obtained from the usual grand canonical ensemble.
As a first non-trivial application we calculate the pressure of Yang-Mills
theory as function of the temperature in a quasi-particle approximation
motivated by variational calculations in Coulomb gauge.

Traditional approaches involve various language modeling and machine
translation techniques, however, they perform not as well when generating poems
with complex pattern constraints, for example Song iambics, a famous type of
poems that involve variable-length sentences and strict rhythmic patterns. This
paper applies the attention-based sequence-to-sequence model to generate
Chinese Song iambics. Specifically, we encode the cue sentences by a
bi-directional Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM) model and then predict the entire
iambic with the information provided by the encoder, in the form of an
attention-based LSTM that can regularize the generation process by the fine
structure of the input cues. Several techniques are investigated to improve the
model, including global context integration, hybrid style training, character
vector initialization and adaptation. Both the automatic and subjective
evaluation results show that our model indeed can learn the complex structural
and rhythmic patterns of Song iambics, and the generation is rather successful.

layers of the solar atmosphere from the photosphere to upper chromosphere. We
study the distribution of power in different period-bands at different heights.
Power maps of the upper photosphere and the lower chromosphere show suppressed
power surrounding the magnetic-network elements, known as ""magnetic shadows"".
These also show enhanced power close to the photosphere, traditionally referred
to as ""power halos"". The interaction between acoustic waves and inclined
magnetic fields is generally believed to be responsible for these two effects.
In this study we explore if small-scale transients can influence the
distribution of power at different heights. We show that the presence of
transients, like mottles, Rapid Blueshifted Excursions (RBEs) and Rapid
Redshifted Excursions (RREs), can strongly influence the power-maps. The short
and finite lifetime of these events strongly affects all powermaps, potentially
influencing the observed power distribution. We show that Doppler-shifted
transients like RBEs and RREs that occur ubiquitously, can have a dominant
effect on the formation of the power halos in the quiet Sun. For magnetic
shadows, transients like mottles do not seem to have a significant effect in
the power suppression around 3 minutes and wave interaction may play a key role
here. Our high cadence observations reveal that flows, waves and shocks
manifest in presence of magnetic fields to form a non-linear
magnetohydrodynamic system.

Notably, it contains a copy of the Cuntz algebra $\mathcal{O}_2=C^*(S_1, S_2)$

results, the relative commutant $C^*(S_2)'\cap \mathcal{Q}_2$ is shown to be

$\mathcal{O}_2\subset\mathcal{Q}_2$, namely the endomorphisms of
$\mathcal{Q}_2$ that restrict to the identity on $\mathcal{O}_2$ are actually
the identity on the whole $\mathcal{Q}_2$. Moreover, there is no conditional

structure of $\mathcal{Q}_2$, the diagonal subalgebra $\mathcal{D}_2$ and
$C^*(U)$ are both proved to be maximal abelian in $\mathcal{Q}_2$. The
maximality of the latter allows a thorough investigation of several classes of

semigroup of the endomorphisms fixing $U$ turns out to be a maximal abelian

of these network jets, e.g. apparent speed, length, lifetime and increase in

quiet sun and coronal holes. For example, our study shows that the coronal-hole
jets appear to be faster and longer than those in the quiet sun. This can be
directly attributed to a difference in the magnetic configuration of the two
regions with open magnetic field lines rooted in coronal holes and magnetic
loops often present in quiet sun. We have also detected compact bright loops,
likely transition region loops, mostly in quiet sun. These small loop-like
regions are generally devoid of network jets. In spite of different magnetic
structures in the coronal hole and quiet sun in the transition region, there
appears to be no substantial difference for the increase in foot-point

closed-loop pulsating heat pipe (PHP). Heat flux and constant temperature
boundary conditions have been applied for heating and cooling sections
respectively. Water was used as working fluid. Volume of Fluid (VOF) method has
been employed for two-phase flow simulation. Volume fraction results showed
formation of perfect vapor and liquid plugs in the fluid flow of PHP.
Non-linear time series analysis, power spectrum density, correlation dimension
and autocorrelation function were used to investigate the chaos. Absence of
dominating peaks in the power spectrum density was a signature of chaos in the
pulsating heat pipe. It was found that by increasing the filling ratio and
evaporator heating power the correlation dimension increases. Decreasing of the
autocorrelation function with respect to time showed the prediction ability is
finite as a result of chaotic state. An optimal filling ratio of 60% and
minimum thermal resistance of 1.62 K/W were found for better thermal
performance of the pulsating heat pipe.

adaptive versus non-adaptive changes in the evolution of complexity. While
selection is certainly responsible for the spread and maintenance of complex
phenotypes, this does not automatically imply that strong selection enhances
the chance for the emergence of novel traits, that is, the origination of
complexity. Population size is one parameter that alters the relative
importance of adaptive and non-adaptive processes: as population size
decreases, selection weakens and genetic drift grows in importance. Because of
this relationship, many theories invoke a role for population size in the
evolution of complexity. Such theories are difficult to test empirically
because of the time required for the evolution of complexity in biological
populations. Here, we used digital experimental evolution to test whether large
or small asexual populations tend to evolve greater complexity. We find that
both small and large---but not intermediate-sized---populations are favored to
evolve larger genomes, which provides the opportunity for subsequent increases
in phenotypic complexity. However, small and large populations followed
different evolutionary paths towards these novel traits. Small populations
evolved larger genomes by fixing slightly deleterious insertions, while large
populations fixed rare beneficial insertions that increased genome size. These
results demonstrate that genetic drift can lead to the evolution of complexity
in small populations and that purifying selection is not powerful enough to
prevent the evolution of complexity in large populations.

the distribution of taxa of different levels (the number of species and genera
in families, species/genera ratio in families, the number of species in the
genera). In most cases, these distributions are satisfactorily described by a
power law (Pareto distribution). In logarithmic coordinates power function is a
straight line. Empirical curves repeat this line is good enough, but on the
right side of the graph (at low volumes taxa), there is a marked deviation of
theoretical from the empirical curves. This suggests that the small volumes of
taxa should be greater for full compliance with the theoretical curves.
Modeling ratios among genera and species in families showed that only in the
case of dynamic extinction factor observed satisfactory agreement between
observed and calculated the number of species in a wide range of iterations.
This suggested that there was a differential extinction of species during the
evolution of angiosperms. This implies that the rate of extinction had to be
minimal in genera with a large number of species. On the contrary, extinction
rates may be increased by orders of magnitude with a decrease in the number of
species. As a result, large genera became getting bigger and small genera
become less. The species frequencies of distribution in the genera varied
according to a power law. The initial divergence of taxa volume, which led to
their further division into large and small, could be caused by the emergence
and expansion of herbs with their functional and adaptive capabilities.

space where magnetic catalysis occurs at zero temperature but inverse magnetic

melting and chiral transitions in the holographic framework. The introduction

is proposed. Firstly, starting from a set of complete orthogonal time-dependent
basis with undetermined coefficients, a time-dependent Hamiltonian is derived
via Counterdiabatic driving for the purpose of guiding the system to attain an
arbitrary target state at a predefined time. Then, on request of the assumed
target states, two single-mode driving protocols and a multi-mode driving
protocol are proposed as examples to discuss the validity of the QSE scheme.
The result of comparison between single-mode driving and multi-mode driving
shows that multi-mode driving seems to have a wider rang of application
prospect because it can drive the system to an arbitrary target state from an
arbitrary initial state also at a predefined time even without the use of
microwave fields for the transition between the two ground states. Moreover,
for the purpose of discussion in the scheme's feasibility in practice, a
polynomial ansatz as the simplest exampleis used to fix the pulses. The result
shows that the pulses designed to implement the protocols are not hard to be
realized in practice. At the end, QSE in higher-dimensional systems is also
discussed in brief as a generalization example of the scheme.

theoretically confirmed. The bulk modulus increases and the shear modulus
decreases due to partial Bi/Sn/Sb substitution for Al in Zr2AlC. The calculated

  Convolutional Neural Networks","Accepted at CVPR 2016. The first two authors assert equal
  contribution and joint first authorship",,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In this paper we present a deep neural network topology that incorporates a
simple to implement transformation invariant pooling operator (TI-POOLING).
This operator is able to efficiently handle prior knowledge on nuisance
variations in the data, such as rotation or scale changes. Most current methods
usually make use of dataset augmentation to address this issue, but this
requires larger number of model parameters and more training data, and results
in significantly increased training time and larger chance of under- or
overfitting. The main reason for these drawbacks is that the learned model
needs to capture adequate features for all the possible transformations of the
input. On the other hand, we formulate features in convolutional neural
networks to be transformation-invariant. We achieve that using parallel siamese
architectures for the considered transformation set and applying the TI-POOLING
operator on their outputs before the fully-connected layers. We show that this
topology internally finds the most optimal ""canonical"" instance of the input
image for training and therefore limits the redundancy in learned features.
This more efficient use of training data results in better performance on
popular benchmark datasets with smaller number of parameters when comparing to
standard convolutional neural networks with dataset augmentation and to other
baselines.

oxidation can cause severe local deformations on the monolayer GeSe structure

reformulated as commutative stochastic games. When there is only one player and

This paper shows that at a finite temperature, when $S^5$ without rotation is
close to the horizon, the Schwinger effect fails because the particles remain
in an annihilate state, which is an absolute vacuum state. However, the angular
velocity in $S^5$ will avoid the existence of an absolute vacuum near the

us to derive extremely simple expressions for the emergent Friedmann-like

such a scenario, the dynamical evolution of a chemically nonequilibrated system
is described by the ideal (2+1)-dimensional hydrodynamics with a time dependent
(anti)quark fugacity. The equation of state interpolates linearly between the
lattice data for the pure gluonic matter and the lattice data for the
chemically equilibrated quark-gluon plasma. The spectra and elliptic flows of
thermal dileptons and photons are calculated for central Pb+Pb collisions at

test the sensitivity of the results to the choice of equilibration times,

reached already at the initial stage. It is shown that a suppression of quarks
at early times leads to a significant reduction of the yield of the thermal
dileptons, but only to a rather modest suppression of the $p_T$-distribution of
direct photons. It is demonstrated that an enhancement of photon and dilepton
elliptic flows might serve as a promising signature of the pure-glue initial
state.

carry out a detailed study of the interactions between the nonlinear and

of invariant states in the multi-parameter limit to the convergence of

the small parameter system and the limit equation, and due to the
multi-parameter nature of the problem, further analysis is required to
establish the singular limit. In particular, we develop methods to lift the
contraction for the limit equation to the extended phase space, including the

in self-fertilising populations most models developed make the assumption that
populations have discrete non-overlapping generations. This makes them
biologically irrelevant when considering perennial species with over-lapping
generations and where mating occurs independently of the age group. Previous
models studying the effect of perennial life-histories on the genetic
properties of populations in the presence of self-fertilisation have done so
considering age-dependent selection and have found that, contrary to empirical
observations, perennial populations should exhibit lower levels of inbreeding
depression. Here we propose a simple deterministic model in continuous time
with selection at different fitness traits and feedback between population
fitness and size. We find that a perennial life-history can result in high
levels of inbreeding depression in spite of inbreeding, due to higher
frequencies of heterozygous individuals at the adult stage. We also propose
that there may be demographic advantages for self-fertilisation that are
independent of reproductive success.

and the orbit may be dominant factors determining the jet properties beyond the
binary scales.} An analytical study is performed to characterize the effects of
the stellar wind and the orbital motion on the jet properties. Accounting for
the wind thrust transferred to the jet, we derive analytical estimates to
characterize the jet evolution under the impact of the stellar wind. We include
the Coriolis force effect, induced by orbital motion and enhanced by the wind
presence. Large-scale evolution of the jet is sketched accounting for
wind-to-jet thrust transfer, total energy conservation, and wind-jet flow
mixing. If the angle of the wind-induced jet bending is larger than its
half-opening angle, the following is expected: (i) a strong recollimation
shock; (ii) bending against orbital motion, caused by Coriolis forces and
enhanced by the wind presence; and (iii) non-ballistic helical propagation
further away. Even if disrupted, the jet can reaccelerate due to ambient
pressure gradients, but wind entrainment can weaken this acceleration. On large
scales, the opening angle of the helical structure is determined by the
wind-jet thrust relation, and the wind-loaded jet flow can be rather slow. The
impact of stellar winds on high-mass microquasar jets can yield non-ballistic
helical jet trajectories, jet partial disruption and wind mixing, shocks, and
possibly non-thermal emission. Among several observational diagnostics at
different bands, the radio morphology on milliarcsecond scales can be
particularly insightful regarding the wind-jet interaction.

its relation types. In experimental results on the FB15k-237 benchmark we

using numerical simulations. Planetary embryos large enough to become giant
planets do not form beyond the ice line within a typical disk lifetime unless
icy pebbles stick at higher speeds than in experiments using rocky pebbles.
Systems like the Solar System (small inner planets, giant outer planets) can
form if (i) icy pebbles are stickier than rocky pebbles, and (ii) the
planetesimal formation efficiency increases with pebble size, which prevents
the formation of massive terrestrial planets. Growth beyond the ice line is
dominated by pebble accretion. Most growth occurs early, when the surface
density of pebbles is high due to inward drift of pebbles from the outer disk.
Growth is much slower after the outer disk is depleted. The outcome is
sensitive to the disk radius and turbulence level, which control the lifetime
and maximum size of pebbles. The outcome is sensitive to the size of the
largest planetesimals since there is a threshold mass for the onset of pebble
accretion. The planetesimal formation rate is unimportant provided that some
large planetesimals form while pebbles remain abundant. Two outcomes are seen,
depending on whether pebble accretion begins while pebbles are still abundant.
Either (i) multiple gas giant planets form beyond the ice line, small planets
form close to the star, and a Kuiper-belt-like disk of bodies is scattered
outwards by the giant planets; or (ii) no giants form and bodies remain
Earth-mass or smaller.

problem, of utmost relevance for banking, insurance, engineering and the

$g_i(s)=\exp(-\alpha_i s),$ th expected values $E[\exp-\alpha_i S)]$ are the

Since inverting the Laplace transform is an ill-posed problem, to devise
numerical tecniques that are efficient is of importance for many applications,
specially in cases where all we know is the value of the transform at a few
points along the real axis. A simple change of variables transforms the Laplace
inversion problem into a fractional moment problem on $[0,1].$ It is remarkable
that the maximum entropy procedure allows us to determine the density on
$[0,1]$ with high accuracy. In this note, we examine why this might be so.

solve the Von Karman's plate equations in the integral form for a circular
plate with the clamped boundary under an arbitrary uniform external pressure.
Two HAM-based approaches are proposed. One is for a given external load Q, the
other for a given central deflection. Both of them are valid for an arbitrary
uniform external pressure by means of choosing a proper value of the so-called
convergence-control parameters c_1 and c_2 in the frame of the HAM. Besides, it
is found that iteration can greatly accelerate the convergence of solution
series. In addition, we prove that the interpolation iterative method is a
special case of the HAM-based 1st-order iteration approach for a given external
load Q when c_1=-theta and c_2=-1, where theta denotes the interpolation
parameter of the interpolation iterative method. Therefore, like Zheng and
Zhou}, one can similarly prove that the HAM-based approaches are valid for an
arbitrary uniform external pressure, at least in some special cases such as
c_1=-theta and c_2=-1. Furthermore, it is found that the HAM-based iteration
approaches converge much faster than the interpolation iterative method. All of
these illustrate the validity and potential of the HAM for the famous Von
Karman's plate equations, and show the superiority of the HAM over perturbation

the interactions between shells. Dipolar motion of each constituent spherical
shell is allowed along the net dipole moment, but higher order
