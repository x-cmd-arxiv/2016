gamma-ray bursts. Over the last few years, a strong correlation between the
intrinsic X-ray absorbing column density (N_H(z)) and the redshift was found.
This absorption excess in high-z GRBs is now thought to be due to the
overlooked contribution of the absorption along the intergalactic medium, by
means of both intervening objects and the diffuse warm-hot intergalactic medium
along the line of sight. In this work we neglect the absorption along the IGM,
because our purpose is to study the eventual effect of a radical change in the
Galactic absorption model on the N_H(z) distribution. Therefore, we derive the
intrinsic absorbing column densities using two different Galactic absorption
models, the Leiden Argentine Bonn HI survey and the more recent model including
molecular hydrogen. We find that, if on the one hand the new Galactic model
considerably affects the single column density values, on the other hand there
is no drastic change in the distribution as a whole. It becomes clear that the
contribution of Galactic column densities alone, no matter how improved, is not
sufficient to change the observed general trend and it has to be considered as
a second-order correction. The cosmological increase of N_H(z) as a function of
redshift persists and, in order to explain the observed distribution, it is
necessary to include the contribution of both the diffuse intergalactic medium
and the intervening systems along the line of sight of the GRBs.

of Reionization (EoR, $z\gsim6$) indicate a very steep increase of the number
density of low-mass galaxies populating the LF faint-end. However, as star
formation in low-mass halos can be easily depressed or even quenched by
ionizing radiation, a turnover is expected at some faint UV magnitudes. Using a
physically-motivated analytical model, we quantify reionization feedback
effects on the LF faint-end shape. We find that if reionization feedback is
neglected, the power-law Schechter parameterization characterizing the LF
faint-end remains valid up to absolute UV magnitude $\sim -9$. If instead
radiative feedback is strong enough that quenches star formation in halos with
circular velocity smaller than 50 km s$^{-1}$, the LF starts to drop at
absolute UV magnitude $\sim -15$, i.e. slightly below the detection limits of
current (unlensed) surveys at $z\sim5$. The LFs may rise again at higher
absolute UV magnitude, where, as a result of interplay between reionization
process and galaxy formation, most of the galaxy light is from relic stars
formed before the EoR. We suggest that the galaxy number counts data,
particularly in lensed fields, can put strong constraints on reionization
feedback. In models with stronger reionization feedback, stars in galaxies with
absolute UV magnitude higher than $\sim -13$ and smaller than $\sim - 8$ are
typically older. Hence, the stellar age - UV magnitude relation can be used as
an alternative feedback probe.

calculated using a semi-analytical method, as a function of frequency and angle
of incidence. The conversion between forward and backward Lamb modes is
thoroughly investigated. It is shown that, at the zero-group velocity (ZGV)
frequency, the forward $S_1$ Lamb mode fully converts into the backward
$S_{2b}$ Lamb mode at normal incidence. Besides, this conversion is very
efficient over most of the angular spectrum and remains dominant at frequencies
just above the ZGV-point. This effect is observed experimentally on a Duralumin
plate. Firstly, the $S_1$ Lamb mode is selectively generated using a transducer
array, secondly the $S_{2b}$ mode is excited using a single circular
transducer. The normal displacement field is probed with an interferometer. The
free edge is shown to retro-focus the incident wave at different depths
depending on the wave number mismatch between the forward and backward
propagating modes. In the vicinity of the ZGV-point, wave numbers coincide and
the wave is retro-reflected on the source. In this frequency range, the free
edge acts as a perfect phase conjugating mirror.

energy phenomena. They are universal and systematic: they can be formulated for
any low energy systems we can think of and offer a clear guide on how to
calculate predictions with reliable error estimates, a feature that is called
power counting. These properties can be easily understood in Wilsonian
renormalization, in which effective field theories are the low energy
renormalization group evolution of a more fundamental ---perhaps unknown or
unsolvable--- high energy theory. In nuclear physics they provide the
possibility of a theoretically sound derivation of nuclear forces without
having to solve quantum chromodynamics explicitly. However there is the problem
of how to organize calculations within nuclear effective field theory: the
traditional knowledge about power counting is perturbative but nuclear physics
is not. Yet power counting can be derived in Wilsonian renormalization and
there is already a fairly good understanding of how to apply these ideas to
non-perturbative phenomena and in particular to nuclear physics. Here we review

goal is to characterize the RR Lyrae stars in the outer bulge in terms of their
periods, amplitudes, Fourier coefficients, and distances, in order to evaluate
the 3D structure of the bulge in this area. The distance distribution of RR
Lyrae stars will be compared to the one of red clump stars that is known to
trace a X-shaped structure in order to determine if these two different stellar
populations share the same Galactic distribution. We report the detection of
more than 1000 RR Lyrae ab-type stars in the VVV Survey located in the

Sagittarius Dwarf Spheroidal Galaxy. We calculated colors, reddening,
extinction, and distances of the detected RR Lyrae stars in order to determine
the outer bulge 3D structure. Our main result is that, at the low galactic
latitudes mapped here, the RR Lyrae stars trace a centrally concentrated
spheroidal distribution. This is a noticeably different spatial distribution to
the one traced by red clump stars known to follow a bar and X-shape structure.

needs to go beyond standard regression and instead estimate the full
conditional density f(z|x) of a galaxy's redshift z given its photometric

only the rarest and brightest galaxies have known redshifts, and these galaxies
have characteristics and measured covariates that do not necessarily match
those of more numerous and dimmer galaxies of unknown redshift. Unfortunately,
there is not much research on how to best estimate complex multivariate

particle candidate able to produce such an extra line is sterile neutrino with
the mass of ~7 keV. Previous works show that sterile neutrino dark matter with

obtain that such sterile neutrino dark matter would produce significantly
sharper reionization compared to widely used cold dark matter models,
impossible to 'imitate' within the cold dark matter scenario under any
reasonable choice of our model parameters, and would have a clear tendency of
lowering both the redshift of reionization and the electron scattering optical
depth (although the difference is still below the existing model
uncertainties). Further dedicated studies of reionization (such as 21 cm

essential for reconstruction of particle candidate responsible the ~3.5 keV

separately preceding category recognition. In contrast, neuroscience studies on

and category recognition? In this paper, we introduce a novel material category

effective time-varying trapping frequency in connection with the dynamically
changing combined external+laser potential trap. The resulting dynamics are
analyzed by plotting their trajectories in coordinate phase space and in energy

the latter space. Quantum effects and trap anharmonicity are demonstrated to
generate chaos in energy space, thus confirming its presence and implicating
either quantum effects or trap anharmonicity as its generator. The presence of

illumination, and geometry) is a long-sought ability of computer vision that
can provide invaluable information for a wide range of applications.
Deciphering the radiometric ingredients from the appearance of a real-world
scene, as opposed to a single isolated object, is particularly challenging as
it generally consists of various objects with different material compositions
exhibiting complex reflectance and light interactions that are also part of the
illumination. We introduce the first method for radiometric scene decomposition
that handles those intricacies. We use RGB-D images to bootstrap geometry
recovery and simultaneously recover the complex reflectance and natural
illumination while refining the noisy initial geometry and segmenting the scene
into different material regions. Most important, we handle real-world scenes
consisting of multiple objects of unknown materials, which necessitates the
modeling of spatially-varying complex reflectance, natural illumination,
texture, interreflection and shadows. We systematically evaluate the
effectiveness of our method on synthetic scenes and demonstrate its application
to real-world scenes. The results show that rich radiometric information can be
recovered from RGB-D images and demonstrate a new role RGB-D sensors can play
for general scene understanding tasks.

have to radically rethink our strategy or give up our dreams of reaching the
stars, or wait for technology that does not currently exist. While we all dream
of human spaceflight to the stars in a way romanticized in books and movies, it
is not within our power to do so, nor it is clear that this is the path we
should choose. We posit a technological path forward, that while not simple, it

vast array of possibilities of flight both within our solar system and far
beyond. Spacecraft from gram level complete spacecraft on a wafer (""wafersats"")

spacecraft with masses more than $10^5$ kg (100 tons) that can reach speeds of
greater than 1000 km/s. These systems can be propelled to speeds currently
unimaginable with existing propulsion technologies. To do so requires a
fundamental change in our thinking of both propulsion and in many cases what a
spacecraft is. In addition to larger spacecraft, some capable of transporting
humans, we consider functional spacecraft on a wafer, including integrated
optical communications, imaging systems, photon thrusters, power and sensors
combined with directed energy propulsion.

high-dimensional $x\in\mathbb{R}^n$ subject to $\texttt{update}(i,\Delta)$
causing $x_i\leftarrow x_i + \Delta$, where $i\in[n]$, $\Delta\in\mathbb{R}$.
Upon receiving a query, the goal is to report a small list $L\subset[n]$, $|L|

\ge \varepsilon \|x_{\overline{1/\varepsilon^p}}\|_p$, where $x_{\overline{k}}$
denotes the vector obtained by zeroing out the largest $k$ entries of $x$ in
magnitude.
  For any $p\in(0,2]$ the CountSketch solves $\ell_p$ heavy hitters using
$O(\varepsilon^{-p}\log n)$ words of space with $O(\log n)$ update time,
$O(n\log n)$ query time to output $L$, and whose output after any query is
correct with high probability (whp) $1 - 1/poly(n)$. Unfortunately the query
time is very slow. To remedy this, the work [CM05] proposed for $p=1$ in the
strict turnstile model, a whp correct algorithm achieving suboptimal space
$O(\varepsilon^{-1}\log^2 n)$, worse update time $O(\log^2 n)$, but much better
query time $O(\varepsilon^{-1}poly(\log n))$.
  We show this tradeoff between space and update time versus query time is
unnecessary. We provide a new algorithm, ExpanderSketch, which in the most
general turnstile model achieves optimal $O(\varepsilon^{-p}\log n)$ space,
$O(\log n)$ update time, and fast $O(\varepsilon^{-p}poly(\log n))$ query time,
and whp correctness. Our main innovation is an efficient reduction from the
heavy hitters to a clustering problem in which each heavy hitter is encoded as
some form of noisy spectral cluster in a much bigger graph, and the goal is to
identify every cluster. Since every heavy hitter must be found, correctness
requires that every cluster be found. We then develop a ""cluster-preserving
clustering"" algorithm, partitioning the graph into clusters without destroying
any original cluster.

approaches in computer vision use category labels from datasets such as
ImageNet to train ConvNets. However, in case of biological agents, visual
representation learning does not require millions of semantic labels. We argue
that biological agents use physical interactions with the world to learn visual
representations unlike current vision systems which just use passive
observations (images and videos downloaded from web). For example, babies push
objects, poke them, put them in their mouth and throw them to learn
representations. Towards this goal, we build one of the first systems on a
Baxter platform that pushes, pokes, grasps and observes objects in a tabletop
environment. It uses four different types of physical interactions to collect
more than 130K datapoints, with each datapoint providing supervision to a
shared ConvNet architecture allowing us to learn visual representations. We
show the quality of learned representations by observing neuron activations and
performing nearest neighbor retrieval on this learned representation.
Quantitatively, we evaluate our learned ConvNet on image classification tasks
and show improvements compared to learning without external data. Finally, on
the task of instance retrieval, our network outperforms the ImageNet network on

band gap can be changed by cation doping. The gap becomes arched in an
ultrathin layer due to the space charge formed from metal-induced gap states.
With an appropriate combination of an arched gap and a bias voltage, NDR can be
produced in either spin channel. This mechanism is applicable to 2D and 3D
ultrathin junctions with a sufficiently small band gap that forms a large space
charge. It provides a new way of controlling the spin-dependent transport in

acting on $\mathcal{O}(k(n))$ qubits with all measurements at the end of the

[STOC '13] by giving new space-efficient quantum algorithms that avoid
intermediate measurements, as well as showing matching hardness results.
  Additionally, as a consequence we show that PreciseQMA, the version of QMA

the problem of estimating the minimum eigenvalue of a local Hamiltonian to
inverse exponential precision is PSPACE-complete, which we show holds even in
the frustration-free case. Finally, we can use this characterization to give a
provable setting in which the ability to prepare the ground state of a local

  Interestingly, by suitably changing the parameterization of either of these

circum-binary gas disc when the binary and the gas are coplanar and the gas is
counter-rotating. The secondary black hole, revolving in the direction opposite
to the gas, experiences a drag from gas-dynamical friction and from direct
accretion of part of it. Using two-dimensional (2D) hydrodynamical grid
simulations we investigate the effect of changing the accretion prescriptions
on the dynamics of the secondary black hole which in turn affect the binary
hardening and eccentricity evolution. We find that realistic accretion
prescriptions lead to results that differ from those inferred assuming
accretion of all the gas within the Roche Lobe of the secondary black hole.
Different accretion prescriptions result in different disc's surface densities
which alter the black hole's dynamics back. Full 3D SPH realizations of a
number of representative cases, run over a shorter interval of time, validate
the general trends observed in the less computationally demanding 2D
simulations. Initially circular black hole binaries increase only slightly
their eccentricity which then oscillates around small values (<0.1) while they
harden. By contrast, initially eccentric binaries become more and more
eccentric. A semi-analytical model describing the black hole's dynamics under
accretion only explores the late evolution stages of the binary in an otherwise
unperturbed retrograde disc to illustrate how eccentricity evolves with time in
relation to the shape of the underlying surface density distribution.

cosmological `zoom-in' simulations from the `Feedback In Realistic
Environments' project, which spans a large range in halo mass 10^10-10^13
Msun). We explore the effect of stellar feedback on the hot gas observables.
The properties of our simulated groups, such as baryon fractions, SZ flux, and
X-ray luminosities (L_X), are broadly consistent with existing observations,
even though feedback from active galactic nuclei is not included. We make
predictions for future observations of lower-mass objects for both SZ and
diffuse X-ray measurements, finding that they are not just scaled-down versions
of massive galaxies, but more strongly affected by galactic winds driven by
star formation. Low-mass haloes (<~10^11 Msun) retain a low fraction of their
baryons, which results in a strong suppression of the SZ signal. Our
simulations therefore predict a scaling with halo mass that is steeper than
self-similar for haloes less massive than 10^13 Msun. For halo masses <~10^12
Msun, L_X is time-variable and correlated primarily with the star formation
rate (SFR). For these objects, the diffuse X-ray emission is powered mostly by
galactic winds and the gas dominating the X-ray emission is flowing out with
radial velocities close to the halo's circular velocity. For halo masses
>~10^13 Msun, on the other hand, L_X is much less variable and not correlated
with the SFR, because the emission originates from the quasi-hydrostatic,
virialized halo gas.

explain their observed quiescent and bursting emission, implying that the field
strength within the star's outer crust is orders of magnitude larger than the

challenge to theories of magnetic field generation in a proto-neutron star.
Here, we present detailed modelling of the evolution of the magnetic field in
the crust of a neutron star through 3-D simulations. We find that, in the
plausible scenario of equipartition of energy between global-scale poloidal and
toroidal magnetic components, magnetic instabilities transfer energy to
non-axisymmetric, kilometre-sized magnetic features, in which the local field
strength can greatly exceed that of the global-scale field. These intense
small-scale magnetic features can induce high energy bursts through local crust
yielding, and the localised enhancement of Ohmic heating can power the star's
persistent emission. Thus, the observed diversity in magnetar behaviour can be
explained with mixed poloidal-toroidal fields of comparable energies.

poorly constrained. The spectrum of the excess emission is observed to extend
upwards of 10 GeV outside $\sim5^\circ$ in radius, but cuts off steeply between
10--20 GeV only in the innermost few degrees. If interpreted as a real feature

after fitting the data, which implies that mismodeling is an important
systematic effect in point source analyses aimed at resolving the gamma-ray
excess.

sources over a very broad, densely-sampled frequency band. Our sample was
selected on the basis of polarization behaviour apparent in narrowband archival
data at 1.4 GHz: half the sample show complicated frequency-dependent
polarization behaviour (i.e. Faraday complexity) at these frequencies, while
half show comparatively simple behaviour (i.e. they appear Faraday simple). We
re-observed the sample using the Australia Telescope Compact Array (ATCA) in
full polarization, with 6 GHz of densely sampled frequency coverage spanning
1.3 to 10 GHz. We have devised a general polarization modelling technique that
allows us to identify multiple polarized emission components in a source, and
to characterize their properties. We detect Faraday complex behaviour in almost
every source in our sample. Several sources exhibit particularly remarkable
polarization behaviour. By comparing our new and archival data, we have
identified temporal variability in the broadband integrated polarization
spectra of some sources. In a number of cases, the characteristics of the
polarized emission components, including the range of Faraday depths over which
they emit, their temporal variability, spectral index, and the linear extent of
the source, allow us to argue that the spectropolarimetric data encodes
information about the magnetoionic environment of active galactic nuclei
themselves. Furthermore, the data place direct constraints on the geometry and
magnetoionic structure of this material. We discuss the consequences of
restricted frequency bands on the detection and interpretation of polarization
structures, and implications for upcoming spectropolarimetric surveys.

updated model of the Milky Way's interstellar gas, radial velocities, an
updated reddening map, and a careful statistical analysis, to bound the allowed
surface density and scale height of a dark disk. We pay careful attention to
the self-consistency of the model, including the gravitational influence of the
dark disk on other disk components, and to the net velocity of the tracer
stars. We find that the data set exhibits a non-zero bulk velocity in the
vertical direction as well as a displacement from the expected location at the
Galactic midplane. If not properly accounted for, these features would bias the
bound toward low dark disk mass. We therefore perform our analysis two ways. In
the first, traditional method, we subtract the mean velocity and displacement
from the tracers' phase space distributions. In the second method, we perform a
non-equilibrium version of the HF method to derive a bound on the dark disk
parameters for an oscillating tracer distribution. Despite updates in the mass
model and reddening map, the traditional method results remain consistent with
those of HF2000. The second, non-equilibrium technique, however, allows a
surface density as large as $14\, M_\odot\,{\rm pc}^{-2}$ (and as small as 0),
demonstrating much weaker constraints. For both techniques, the bound on
surface density is weaker for larger scale height. In future analyses of Gaia
data, it will be important to verify whether the tracer populations are in
equilibrium.

potentially excellent tool to search for extrasolar planets around cool or
active stars. High resolution infrared (IR) spectrographs now available are
reaching the high precision of visible instruments, with a constant improvement
over time. GIANO is an infrared echelle spectrograph at the Telescopio
Nazionale Galileo (TNG) and it is a powerful tool to provide high resolution
spectra for accurate RV measurements of exoplanets and for chemical and
dynamical studies of stellar or extragalactic objects. No other high spectral
resolution IR instrument has GIANO's capability to cover the entire NIR
wavelength range (0.95-2.45 micron) in a single exposure. In this paper we
describe the ensemble of procedures that we have developed to measure high
precision RVs on GIANO spectra acquired during the Science Verification (SV)
run, using the telluric lines as wavelength reference. We used the Cross
Correlation Function (CCF) method to determine the velocity for both the star
and the telluric lines. For this purpose, we constructed two suitable digital
masks that include about 2000 stellar lines, and a similar number of telluric
lines. The method is applied to various targets with different spectral type,
from K2V to M8 stars. We reached different precisions mainly depending on the H
-magnitudes: for H ~ 5 we obtain an rms scatter of ~ 10 m s-1, while for H ~ 9
the standard deviation increases to ~ 50 - 80 m s-1. The corresponding
theoretical error expectations are ~4 m s-1 and 30 m s-1, respectively. Finally
we provide the RVs measured with our procedure for the targets observed during
GIANO Science Verification.

changing logarithmic slope, such as in NFW or Einasto profiles. However, in two
different classes of commonly used systems, this is often not the case. These
classes exhibit non-monotonic changes in their density profile slopes which we
call oscillations for short. We analyze these two unrelated classes separately.
Class 1 consists of systems that have density oscillations and that are defined
through their distribution function $f(E)$, or differential energy distribution
$N(E)$, such as isothermal spheres, King profiles, or DARKexp, a theoretically
derived model for relaxed collisionless systems. Systems defined through $f(E)$
or $N(E)$ generally have density slope oscillations. Class 1 system
oscillations can be found at small, intermediate, or large radii but we focus
on a limited set of Class 1 systems that have oscillations in the central
regions, usually at $\log(r/r_{-2})\lesssim -2$, where $r_{-2}$ is the largest
radius where $d\log(\rho)/d\log(r)=-2$. We show that the shape of their $N(E)$
can roughly predict the amplitude of oscillations. Class 2 systems which are a
product of dynamical evolution, consist of observed and simulated galaxies and
clusters, and pure dark matter halos. Oscillations in the density profile slope
seem pervasive in the central regions of Class 2 systems. We argue that in
these systems, slope oscillations are an indication that a system is not fully
relaxed. We show that these oscillations can be reproduced by small
modifications to $N(E)$ of DARKexp. These affect a small fraction of systems'
mass and are confined to $\log(r/r_{-2})\lesssim 0$. The size of these
modifications serves as a potential diagnostic for quantifying how far a system
is from being relaxed.

negligible: $|\Omega_{\rm K}| \lesssim 5 \times 10^{-3}$ (95% CL). Neglecting
it as a cosmological parameter would be premature however, as more stringent
constraints on $\Omega_{\rm K}$ at around the $10^{-4}$ level would offer
valuable tests of eternal inflation models and probe novel large-scale
structure phenomena. This precision also represents the ""curvature floor"",
beyond which constraints cannot be meaningfully improved due to the cosmic
variance of horizon-scale perturbations. In this paper, we discuss what future
experiments will need to do in order to measure spatial curvature to this
maximum accuracy. Our conservative forecasts show that the curvature floor is
unreachable - by an order of magnitude - even with Stage IV experiments, unless
strong assumptions are made about dark energy evolution and the $\Lambda$CDM
parameter values. We also discuss some of the novel problems that arise when
attempting to constrain a global cosmological parameter like $\Omega_{\rm K}$
with such high precision. Measuring curvature down to this level would be an
important validation of systematics characterisation in high-precision
cosmological analyses.

relative to previous measurements, whereas the low resolution $K_1$
($\lambda/\delta\lambda \approx 66$) spectrum is featureless within the

pseudo-continuum consistent with a cloudy atmosphere. By combining these new
measurements with literature $L^{\prime}$ photometry, we compare the spectral
energy distribution of the planet to other young planetary-mass companions,
field brown dwarfs, and to the predictions of grids of model atmospheres. HD
95086 b is over a magnitude redder in $K_1-L^{\prime}$ color than 2MASS
J12073346-3932539 b and HR 8799 c and d, despite having a similar $L^{\prime}$
magnitude. Considering only the near-infrared measurements, HD 95086 b is most
analogous to the brown dwarfs 2MASS J2244316+204343 and 2MASS
J21481633+4003594, both of which are thought to have dusty atmospheres.
Morphologically, the spectral energy distribution of HD 95086 b is best fit by
low temperature ($T_{\rm eff} =$ 800-1300 K), low surface gravity spectra from
models which simulate high photospheric dust content. This range of effective
temperatures is consistent with field L/T transition objects, but the spectral
type of HD 95086 b is poorly constrained between early L and late T due to its
unusual position the color-magnitude diagram, demonstrating the difficulty in
spectral typing young, low surface gravity substellar objects. As one of the
reddest such objects, HD 95086 b represents an important empirical benchmark
against which our current understanding of the atmospheric properties of young
extrasolar planets can be tested.

labor-intensive work, requiring a unique skill set. dMath allows a wide range
of developers to utilize parallel and distributed hardware easily. One
contribution of this approach is that data is stored persistently on the GPU
hardware, avoiding costly transfers between host and device. Advanced memory
management techniques are utilized, including caching of transferred data and
memory reuse through pooling. A key contribution of dMath is that it delivers

accurate head pose estimation achieved by fitting a person specific morphable
model of the face to depth data. The ordinarily competing requirements of high
accuracy and high speed are met concurrently by formulating the fitting
objective function as a combination of terms which excel either in accurate or
fast fitting, and then by adaptively adjusting their relative contributions
throughout fitting. Following pose estimation, pose normalization is done by
re-rendering the fitted model as a frontal face. Finally gaze estimates are
obtained through regression from the appearance of the eyes in synthetic,
normalized images. Using EYEDIAP, the standard public dataset for the
evaluation of gaze estimation algorithms from RGB-D data, we demonstrate that
our method greatly outperforms the state of the art.

parameter $k$, select $k$ sets $A_{i_1}, A_{i_2},\cdots, A_{i_k}$ for maximum
union $A_{i_1}\cup A_{i_2}\cup\cdots\cup A_{i_k}$. In our algorithm, each input
set $A_i$ is a black box that can provide its size $|A_i|$, generate a random
element of $A_i$, and answer the membership query $(x\in A_i?)$ in $O(1)$ time.
Our algorithm gives $(1-{1\over e})$-approximation for maximum coverage problem
in $O(p(m))$ time, which is independent of the sizes of the input sets. No
existing $O(p(m)n^{1-\epsilon})$ time $(1-{1\over e})$-approximation algorithm
for the maximum coverage has been found for any function $p(m)$ that only
depends on the number of sets, where $n=\max(|A_1|,\cdots,| A_m|)$ (the largest
size of input sets). The notion of partial sublinear time algorithm is
introduced. For a computational problem with input size controlled by two
parameters $n$ and $m$, a partial sublinear time algorithm for it runs in a
$O(p(m)n^{1-\epsilon})$ time or $O(q(n)m^{1-\epsilon})$ time. The maximum
coverage has a partial sublinear time $O(p(m))$ constant factor approximation.
On the other hand, we show that the maximum coverage problem has no partial
sublinear $O(q(n)m^{1-\epsilon})$ time constant factor approximation algorithm.
It separates the partial sublinear time computation from the conventional
sublinear time computation by disproving the existence of sublinear time
approximation algorithm for the maximum coverage problem.

where the independent sets are weighted by a parameter $\lambda>0$. For
constant $\Delta$, previous work of Weitz (2006) established an FPTAS for the
partition function for graphs of maximum degree $\Delta$ when $\lambda<
\lambda_c(\Delta)$. The threshold $\lambda_c(\Delta)$ is the critical point for
the phase transition for uniqueness/non-uniqueness on the infinite
$\Delta$-regular trees. Sly (2010) showed that there is no FPRAS, unless NP=RP,
when $\lambda>\lambda_c(\Delta)$. The running time of Weitz's algorithm is
exponential in $\log(\Delta)$. Here we present an FPRAS for the partition
function whose running time is $O^*(n^2)$. We analyze the simple single-site
Glauber dynamics for sampling from the associated Gibbs distribution. We prove
there exists a constant $\Delta_0$ such that for all graphs with maximum degree
$\Delta\geq\Delta_0$ and girth $\geq 7$, the mixing time of the Glauber
dynamics is $O(n\log(n))$ when $\lambda<\lambda_c(\Delta)$. Our work
complements that of Weitz which applies for constant $\Delta$ whereas our work
applies for all $\Delta \geq \Delta_0$.
  We utilize loopy BP (belief propagation), a widely-used inference algorithm.
A novel aspect of our work is using the principal eigenvector for the BP
operator to design a distance function which contracts in expectation for pairs
of states that behave like the BP fixed point. We also prove that the Glauber
dynamics behaves locally like loopy BP. As a byproduct we obtain that the
Glauber dynamics converges, after a short burn-in period, close to the BP fixed
point, and this implies that the fixed point of loopy BP is a close
approximation to the Gibbs distribution. Using these connections we establish
that loopy BP quickly converges to the Gibbs distribution when the girth $\geq
6$ and $\lambda<\lambda_c(\Delta)$.

of the two-particle Lippmann Schwinger (LS) equation is considered as a means
of avoiding the shortcomings of partial-wave expansion at high energies and in
the context of few-body problems. Upon the regularization of the singular
kernel of the three-dimensional LS equation by a subtraction technique, a
three-variate quadrature rule is used to solve the resulting nonsingular
integral equation. To avoid the computational burden of discretizing three
variables, advantage is taken of the fact that, for central potentials,
azimuthal angle can be integrated out leaving a two-variable reduced integral
equation. Although the singularity in the the kernel of the two-variable
integral equation is weaker than that of the three-dimensional equation, it
nevertheless requires careful handling for quadrature discretization to be
applicable. A regularization method for the kernel of the two-variable integral
equation is derived from the treatment of the singularity in the
three-dimensional equation. A quadrature rule constructed as the direct-product
of single-variable quadrature rules for radial distance and polar angle is used
to discretize the two-variable integral equation. These two- and three-variable
methods are tested on a model nucleon-nucleon potential. The results show that
Nystrom method for the coordinate-space LS equation compares favorably in terms
of its ease of implementation and effectiveness with the Nystrom method for the
momentum-space version of the LS equation .

variables in 11 new hosts of recent SNe~Ia, more than doubling the sample of
SNe~Ia having a Cepheid-calibrated distance for a total of 19; these leverage
the magnitude-z relation based on 300 SNe~Ia at z<0.15. All 19 hosts and the
megamaser system NGC4258 were observed with WFC3, thus nullifying
cross-instrument zeropoint errors. Other improvements include a 33% reduction
in the systematic uncertainty in the maser distance to NGC4258, more Cepheids
and a more robust distance to the LMC from late-type DEBs, HST observations of
Cepheids in M31, and new HST-based trigonometric parallaxes for Milky Way (MW)
Cepheids. We consider four geometric distance calibrations of Cepheids: (i)
megamasers in NGC4258, (ii) 8 DEBs in the LMC, (iii) 15 MW Cepheids with
parallaxes, and (iv) 2 DEBs in M31. H_0 from each is 72.25+/-2.51,
72.04+/-2.67, 76.18+/-2.37, and 74.50+/-3.27 km/sec/Mpc, respectively. Our best
estimate of 73.24+/-1.74 km/sec/Mpc combines the anchors NGC4258, MW, and LMC,
and includes systematic errors for a final uncertainty of 2.4%. This value is
3.4 sigma higher than 66.93+/-0.62 km/sec/Mpc predicted by LambdaCDM with 3
neutrinos with mass 0.06 eV and the Planck data, but reduces to 2.1 sigma
relative to the prediction of 69.3+/-0.7 km/sec/Mpc with the combination of
WMAP+ACT+SPT+BAO, suggesting systematic uncertainties in CMB measurements may
play a role in the tension. If we take the conflict between Planck and H_0 at
face value, one plausible explanation could involve an additional source of

differentially private low-rank factorization} of a matrix. We consider various
settings that are close to the real world applications of low-rank
factorization: (i) the manner in which matrices are updated (row by row or in
an arbitrary manner), (ii) whether matrices are distributed or not, and (iii)
how the output is produced (once at the end of all updates, also known as {\em
one-shot algorithms} or continually). Even though these settings are well
studied without privacy, surprisingly, there are no private algorithm for these
settings (except when a matrix is updated row by row). We present the first set
of differentially private algorithms for all these settings.
  Our algorithms when private matrix is updated in an arbitrary manner promise
differential privacy with respect to two stronger privacy guarantees than
previously studied, use space and time {\em comparable} to the non-private
algorithm, and achieve {\em optimal accuracy}. To complement our positive
results, we also prove that the space required by our algorithms is optimal up
to logarithmic factors. When data matrices are distributed over multiple
servers, we give a non-interactive differentially private algorithm with
communication cost independent of dimension. In concise, we give algorithms
that incur optimal cost. We also perform experiments to verify that all our
algorithms perform well in practice and outperform the best known algorithms
until now for large range of parameters. We give experimental results for total
approximation error and additive error for varying dimensions, $\alpha$ and

logarithmic loss fidelity which does not necessarily lead to an additive

Bottleneck method to a multi-source scenario where several encoders have to
build cooperatively rate-limited descriptions of their sources in order to
maximize information with respect to other unobserved (hidden) sources. More
precisely, we study fundamental information-theoretic limits of the so-called:
(i) Two-way Collaborative Information Bottleneck (TW-CIB) and (ii) the
Collaborative Distributed Information Bottleneck (CDIB) problems. The TW-CIB
problem consists of two distant encoders that separately observe marginal
(dependent) components $X_1$ and $X_2$ and can cooperate through multiple
exchanges of limited information with the aim of extracting information about
hidden variables $(Y_1,Y_2)$, which can be arbitrarily dependent on
$(X_1,X_2)$. On the other hand, in CDIB there are two cooperating encoders
which separately observe $X_1$ and $X_2$ and a third node which can listen to
the exchanges between the two encoders in order to obtain information about a
hidden variable $Y$. The relevance (figure-of-merit) is measured in terms of a
normalized (per-sample) multi-letter mutual information metric (log-loss
fidelity) and an interesting tradeoff arises by constraining the complexity of
descriptions, measured in terms of the rates needed for the exchanges between
the encoders and decoders involved. Inner and outer bounds to the
complexity-relevance region of these problems are derived from which optimality
is characterized for several cases of interest. Our resulting theoretical
complexity-relevance regions are finally evaluated for binary symmetric and
Gaussian statistical models.

receiver channel state information is obtained using the information density
approach. No assumptions of ergodicity, stationarity or information stability
are made and the channel state set is arbitrary. A direct (constructive) proof
is given. To prove achievability, we generalize Feinstein Lemma to the compound
channel setting, and to prove converse, we generalize Verdu-Han Lemma to the
same compound setting. A notion of a uniform compound channel is introduced and
the general formula is shown to reduce to the familiar $\sup-\inf$ expression
for such channels. As a by-product, the arbitrary varying channel capacity is
established under maximum error probability and deterministic coding.
Conditions are established under which the worst-case and compound channel
capacities are equal so that the full channel state information at the
transmitter brings in no advantage.
  The compound inf-information rate plays a prominent role in the general
formula. Its properties are studied and a link between information-unstable and
information-stable regimes of a compound channel is established. The results
are extended to include $\varepsilon$-capacity of compound channels. Sufficient

concretely, employing non-local features expressed in J. High Energy Phys. 04

effective action with a non-local dilaton. The non-locality refers to an
infinite derivative kinetic term involving the operator
$\mathcal{F}\left(\Box\right)$. Algebraic roots of the characteristic equation
$\mathcal{F}(z)=0$ play a crucial role in determining the properties of the
theory. We subsequently study the cases when $\mathcal{F}\left(\Box\right)$ has
one real root and one complex root, from which we retrieve two concrete
effective models of inflation. In the first case we retrieve a class of single
field inflations with universal prediction of $n_{s}\sim0.967$ with any value
of the tensor to scalar ratio $r<0.1$ intrinsically controlled by the root of
the characteristic equation. The second case involves a new class of two field
conformally invariant models with a peculiar quadratic cross-product of scalar
fields. In this latter case, we obtain Starobinsky like inflation through a
spontaneously broken conformal invariance. Furthermore, an uplifted minimum of

motivated by scalar field dynamics such as for example quintessence models. Our

this probability can be approximated using only pairwise marginal probabilities
of the entries winning when there is a certain structure on their joint

Building on this, we then consider a scenario where the entries are given by

of the flare within the southern loop system, but all three cusp-shaped
structures are characterized by ~ 10 MK temperatures, hotter than the
arch-shaped loops underneath. The ""Ahead"" satellite of the Solar Terrestrial
Relations Observatory (STEREO) provides a top view, in which the post-flare
loops brighten sequentially, with one end fixed while the other apparently
slipping eastward. By performing stereoscopic reconstruction of the post-flare
loops in EUV and mapping out magnetic connectivities, we found that the
footpoints of the post-flare loops are slipping along the footprint of a
hyperbolic flux tube (HFT) separating the two loop systems, and that the
reconstructed loops share similarity with the magnetic field lines that are
traced starting from the same HFT footprint, where the field lines are
relatively flexible. These results argue strongly in favor of slipping magnetic
reconnection at the HFT. The slipping reconnection was likely triggered by the
flare and manifested as propagative dimmings before the loop slippage is
observed. It may contribute to the late-phase peak in Fe XVI 33.5 nm, which is
even higher than its main-phase counterpart, and may also play a role in the

excellent agreement between an analytical theory based on coupled spin chains

Srisawat et al. (2013) compared a wide range of merger-tree-building codes.
Here we test the influence of output strategies and mass resolution on
tree-building. We find that, somewhat surprisingly, building the tree from more
snapshots does not generally produce more complete trees; instead, it tends to
short- en them. Significant improvements are seen for patching schemes which
attempt to bridge over occasional dropouts in the underlying halo catalogues or
schemes which combine the halo-finding and tree-building steps seamlessly. The
adopted output strategy does not affec- t the average number of branches
(bushiness) of the resultant merger trees. However, mass resolution has an
influence on both main branch length and the bushiness. As the resolution
increases, a halo with the same mass can be traced back further in time and
will encounter more small progenitors during its evolutionary history. Given
these results, we recommend that, for simulations intended as precursors for
galaxy formation models where of order 100 or more snapshots are analysed, the
tree-building routine should be integrated with the halo finder, or at the very
least be able to patch over multiple adjacent snapshots.

decompose the observed IR SEDs of Hot DOGs into torus and cold dust components.
The main results are: 1) Hot DOGs in our submm-detected sample are
hyperluminous, with torus emission dominating the IR energy output. However,
cold dust emission is non-negligible, averagely contributing ~24% of total IR
luminosity. 2) Compared to QSO and starburst SED templates, the median SED of
Hot DOGs shows the highest luminosity ratio between mid-IR and submm at
rest-frame, while it is very similar to that of QSOs at 10-50um suggesting that
the heating sources of Hot DOGs should be buried AGNs. 3) Hot DOGs have both
high dust temperatures ~73K and IR luminosity of cold dust. The T-L relation of
Hot DOGs suggests that the increase in IR luminosity for Hot DOGs is mostly due
to the increase of the dust temperature, rather than dust mass. Hot DOGs have
lower dust masses than those of submillimeter galaxies (SMGs) and QSOs within
the similar redshift range. Both high IR luminosity of cold dust and relatively
low dust mass in Hot DOGs can be expected by their relatively high dust
temperatures. 4) Hot DOGs have high dust covering factors, which deviate the
previously proposed trend of the dust covering factor decreasing with
increasing bolometric luminosity. Finally, we can reproduce the observed
properties in Hot DOGs by employing a physical model of galaxy evolution. The
result suggests that Hot DOGs may lie at or close to peaks of both star
formation and black hole growth histories, and represent a transit phase during
the evolution of massive galaxies, transforming from the dusty starburst
dominated phase to the optically bright QSO phase. (abridged)

communications by providing a statistical analysis of the downlink in network
multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems. We consider an idealized model
where the multiple-antenna base-stations (BSs) are distributed according to a
homogeneous Poisson point process and cooperate by forming disjoint clusters.
We assume that perfect channel state information (CSI) is available at the
cooperating BSs without any overhead. Multiple single-antenna users are served
using zero-forcing beamforming with equal power allocation across the beams.
For such a system, we obtain tractable, but accurate, approximations of the
signal power and inter-cluster interference power distributions and derive a
computationally efficient expression for the achievable per-BS ergodic sum rate
using tools from stochastic geometry. This expression allows us to obtain the
optimal loading factor, i.e., the ratio between the number of scheduled users
and the number of BS antennas, that maximizes the per-BS ergodic sum rate.
Further, it allows us to quantify the performance improvement of network MIMO
systems as a function of the cooperating cluster size. We show that to perform
zero-forcing across the distributed set of BSs within the cluster, the network
MIMO system introduces a penalty in received signal power. Along with the
inevitable out-of-cluster interference, we show that the per-BS ergodic sum
rate of a network MIMO system does not approach that of an isolated cell even
at unrealistically large cluster sizes. Nevertheless, network MIMO does provide
significant rate improvement as compared to uncoordinated single-cell
processing even at relatively modest cluster sizes.

to reduced density matrices, the essential tools of decoherence theory.
Following Bohr's Copenhagen interpretation, textbooks postulate the Born rule
outright. However, recent attempts to derive it from other quantum principles
have been successful, holding promise for simplifying and clarifying the
quantum foundational bedrock. A major family of derivations is based on
envariance, a recently discovered symmetry of entangled quantum states. Here,
we identify and experimentally test three premises central to these

a lens with a narrow aperture and scan across the area where the interference
fringes would be. The aperture is wide enough to separate the slits in the
images, i.e., telling which way. The illumination pattern over the pupil is
reconstructed from the series of slit intensities. The result matches the
double-slit interference pattern well. As such, the photon's wave-like and
particle-like behaviors are observed simultaneously in a straightforward and
thus unambiguous way. The implication is far reaching. For one, it presses
hard, at least philosophically, for a consolidated wave-and-particle
description of quantum objects, because we can no longer dismiss such a
challenge on the basis that the two behaviors do not manifest at the same time.
A bold proposal is to forgo the concept of particles. Then, Heisenberg's

Regarding visual content modeling, most of existing VQA methods adopt the

on a large-scale benchmark dataset, VQA, clearly demonstrate the superior

only statistically limited uncertainty is proposed and demonstrated for the
decay of the P$_{3/2}$ level of the barium ion, with precision below $0.5\%$.
Heavy hydrogenic atoms like the barium ion are test beds for fundamental
physics such as atomic parity violation and they also hold the key to
understanding nucleo-synthesis in stars. To draw definitive conclusion about
possible physics beyond the standard model by measuring atomic parity violation
in the barium ion it is necessary to measure the dipole transition
probabilities of low-lying excited states with precision better than $1\%$.
Furthermore, enhancing our understanding of the $\it{barium-puzzle}$ in barium
stars requires branching fraction data for proper modelling of
nucleo-synthesis. Our measurements are the first to provide a direct test of
quantum many-body calculations on the barium ion with precision below one
percent and more importantly with no known systematic uncertainties. The unique
measurement protocol proposed here can be easily extended to any decay with
more than two channels and hence paves the way for measuring the branching
fractions of other hydrogenic atoms with no significant systematic
uncertainties.

bound $\Omega(n^{2/3})$ for general point sets in $\mathbb R^3$.
  We also show that the number of unit distances determined by $n$ points on a

planar bound, and is worst-case tight in 3-space. This is in sharp contrast
with the best known general bound $O(n^{3/2})$ for points in three dimensions.
  To prove these results, we establish an improved upper bound for the number
of incidences between a set $P$ of $m$ points and a set $S$ of $n$ spheres, of
arbitrary radii, in $\mathbb R^3$, provided that the points lie on an algebraic
surface $V$ of constant degree, which does not have linear or spherical
components. Specifically, the bound is $$ O\left( m^{2/3}n^{2/3} +
m^{1/2}n^{7/8}\log^\beta(m^4/n) + m + n + \sum_{c} |P_{c}|\cdot |S_{c}| \right)

depend on the degree of $V$, and where the sum ranges over all circles $c$ that
are fully contained in $V$, so that, for each such $c$, $P_c = P\cap c$ and
$S_c$ is the set of the spheres of $S$ that contain $c$. In addition, $\sum_{c}
|P_{c}| = O(m)$ and $\sum_{c} |S_{c}| = O(n)$. This bound too improves upon
earlier known bounds. These have been obtained for arbitrary point sets but
only under severe restrictions about the spheres, which are dropped in our
result. Another interesting application of our result is an incidence bound for
arbitrary points and spheres in 3-space, where we improve and generalize the

restraints from NMR, using convex optimization. It is well-known that the
NP-hard distance geometry problem of determining atomic positions from pairwise
distance restraints can be relaxed into a convex semidefinite program. Often
the NOE distance restraints are too imprecise and sparse for accurate structure
determination. Residual dipolar coupling (RDC) measurements provide additional
geometric information on the angles between atom-pair directions and axes of
the principal-axis-frame. The optimization problem involving RDC is highly
non-convex and requires a good initialization even within the simulated
annealing framework. In this paper, we model the protein backbone as an
articulated structure composed of rigid units. Determining the rotation of each
rigid unit gives the full protein structure. We propose solving the non-convex
optimization problems using the sum-of-squares (SOS) hierarchy. The two
algorithms - RDC-SOS and RDC-NOE-SOS, have polynomial time complexity in the
number of amino-acid residues and run efficiently on a standard desktop. In
many instances, the proposed methods exactly recover the solution to the
original non-convex optimization problem. We introduce a statistical tool, the
Cramer-Rao bound (CRB), to provide an information theoretic bound on the
highest resolution one can hope to achieve when determining protein structure
from noisy measurements using any methodology. Our simulation results show that
when the RDC measurements are corrupted by Gaussian noise of realistic
variance, both SOS based algorithms attain the CRB. We successfully apply our
method in a divide-and-conquer fashion to determine the structure of ubiquitin
from experimental NOE and RDC measurements, achieving more accurate and faster
reconstructions compared to the current state of the art.

\hi-deficient galaxies have at the same time lower $M_{\rm HI}/M_{\rm dust}$

the chain is rotated at a constant angular speed around a fixed axis using a

are slow enough for the chain to be always in ""rotational"" equilibrium. The
curve traced by the chain in a rotating plane -- its shape function -- can be
determined by a simple force analysis, yet it possesses complex multi-solutions
behavior typical of non-linear systems. We prove that the configuration space
of the uniformly rotating chain is homeomorphic to a two-dimensional surface
embedded in $\mathbb{R}^3$. Using that representation, we devise a manipulation
strategy for transiting between different rotation modes in a stable and
controlled manner. We demonstrate the strategy on a physical robotic arm

might find fruitful applications in the study of other flexible objects, such

small salt ions. We systematically vary the concentration and the length of the
oligocation, and examine how the oligocations affects the chain conformation,
the static structure factor, the radial and axial distribution of various
charged species, and the number of bound ions in the complex. At low
oligocation concentration, the polyanion has an extended structure. Upon
increasing the oligocation concentration, the polyanion chain collapses and
forms a compact globule, but the complex still carries a net negative charge.
Once the total charge of the oligocations is equal to that of the polyanion,
the collapse stops and is replaced by a slow expansion. In this regime, the net
charge on the complexes is positive or neutral, depending on the microion
concentration in solution. The expansion can be explained by the reduction of
the oligocation bridging. We find that the behavior and the structure of the
complex are largely independent of the length of oligocations, and very similar
to that observed when replacing the oligocations by multivalent salt cations,
and conclude that the main driving force keeping the complex together is the
release of monovalent counterions and coions. We speculate on the implications
of this finding for the problem of controlled oligolyte release and oligolyte

is subsequently exploited to engineer gaps in the energy spectrum by an
appropriate choice of the magnetic substrate. We obtain an exact correlation

magnetic moment of the substrate atoms in the chain desired for opening up of a
spectral gap. Results of spin polarized transport, calculated within a transfer

device which opens a transmission window only for selected spin components over
certain ranges of the Fermi energy, blocking them in the remaining part of the
spectrum. The results appear to be robust even when the choice of the substrate
atoms deviates substantially from the ideal situation, as verified by extending
the ideas to the case of a spin spiral. Interestingly, the spin spiral
geometry, apart from exhibiting the filtering effect, is also seen to act as a
device flipping spins - an effect that can be monitored by an interplay of the

Remote sensing of weak and small-scale solar magnetic fields is of
utmost relevance for a number of important open questions in solar physics.
This requires the acquisition of spectropolarimetric data with high spatial
resolution (0.1 arcsec) and low noise (1e-3 to 1e-5 of the continuum
intensity). The main limitations to obtain these measurements from the ground,
are the degradation of the image resolution produced by atmospheric seeing and
the seeing-induced crosstalk (SIC). Aims. We introduce the prototype of the
Fast Solar Polarimeter (FSP), a new ground-based, high-cadence polarimeter that
tackles the above-mentioned limitations by producing data that are optimally
suited for the application of post-facto image restoration, and by operating at
a modulation frequency of 100 Hz to reduce SIC. Results. The pnCCD camera
reaches 400 fps while keeping a high duty cycle (98.6 %) and very low noise
(4.94 erms). The modulator is optimized to have high (> 80%) total polarimetric
efficiency in the visible spectral range. This allows FSP to acquire 100
photon-noise-limited, full-Stokes measurements per second. We found that the
seeing induced signals present in narrow-band, non-modulated, quiet-sun
measurements are (a) lower than the noise (7e-5) after integrating 7.66 min,
(b) lower than the noise (2.3e-4) after integrating 1.16 min and (c) slightly
above the noise (4e-3) after restoring case (b) by means of a multi-object
multi-frame blind deconvolution. In addition, we demonstrate that by using only
narrow-band images (with low SNR of 13.9) of an active region, we can obtain
one complete set of high-quality restored measurements about every 2 s.

magnitude ratio and strong phase difference between the suppressed and favoured
$B^0$ decay amplitudes, and have been measured in a region of $\pm 50$
MeV/$c^2$ around the $K^{\ast}(892)^{0}$ mass and with the magnitude of the

the extinction to a line emitting region once the relevant spontaneous emission
coefficients are known. This is commonly done, normally from low-resolution
spectra, in observations of shocked gas from jets driven by Young Stellar
Objects. In this paper we review this method, provide the relevant equations,
and test it by analyzing high-resolution ($R \sim 50000$) near-infrared spectra
oftwo young stars, namely the Herbig Be star HD 200775 and the Be star V1478
Cyg, which exhibit intense emission lines. The spectra were obtained with the
new GIANO echelle spectrograph at the Telescopio Nazionale Galileo. Notably,
the high-resolution spectra allowed checking the effects of overlapping
telluric absorption lines. A set of various determinations of the Einstein
coefficients are compared to show how much the available computations affect
extinction derivation. The most recently obtained values are probably good
enough to allow reddening determination within 1 visual mag of accuracy.
Furthermore, we show that [FeII] line ratios from low-resolution pure
emission-line spectra in general are likely to be in error due to the
impossibility to properly account for telluric absorption lines. If
low-resolution spectra are used for reddening determinations, we advice that
the ratio 1.644/1.257, rather than 1.644/1.321, should be used, being less
affected by the effects of telluric absorption lines.

chemical spectroscopy, medicine, security and imaging[1]. It has also recently
become a playground for fundamental studies of light-matter interactions [2-6].
THz science and technology could benefit from optomechanical approaches, which
harness the interaction of light with miniature mechanical resonators [7,8]. So
far, optomechanics has mostly focused on the optical and microwave domains,
leading to new types of quantum experiments [9-11] and to the development of
optical-microwave converters [12-14]. Here we demonstrate an integrated
meta-atom [15] THz resonator with a flexible part acting as a mechanical
oscillator. In this device free space THz photons are collected by the
resonator and induce high frequency currents and charges that, in turn, couple
to the mechanical degrees of freedom. The resulting mechanical motion is
read-out optically, allowing our device to function as a compact and efficient
terahertz detector at room temperature. Furthermore the device operates at high
modulation frequencies (>10MHz), well beyond the cut-off frequencies of Golay
cells, pyroelectric detectors and cryogenic semiconductor bolometers [16,17].
Notably, our experiments unambiguously reveal an instantaneous THz detection
mechanism arising from a nano-scale Coulomb interaction, with a Noise
Equivalent Power that is potentially frequency independent. Alongside this
effect, our compact geometry allows for an uncooled bolometric detection [18]
with extremely short heat diffusion times (few microseconds) and high
detectivity.

short-range exchange interaction between a single manganese (Mn) atom hosted by
cylindrical CdTe quantum dots and its light-hole excitons or biexcitons. Our
approach is based on the Kohn-Luttinger KP theory and configuration interaction
method, the dynamics of the system in the presence of intraband relaxation
being derived from the von Neumann-Lindblad equation. The complex structure of
the light-hole exciton absorption spectrum reveals the exchange-induced exciton
mixing and depends strongly on the Mn position. In particular, if the Mn atom
is closer to the edges of the cylinder the bright and dark light-hole excitons
are mixed by the hole-Mn exchange alone. Consequently, their populations

global magnetohydrodynamical convection presented in Passos et al. 2014. The
turbulent electromotive force operating in the simulation is assumed to be
linearly related to the cyclic axisymmetric mean magnetic field and its first
spatial derivatives. At every grid point in the simulation's meridional plane,
this assumed relationship involves 27 independent tensorial coefficients.
Expanding on Racine et al. 2011, we extract these coefficients from the
simulation data through a least-squares minimization procedure based on
singular value decomposition. The reconstructed alpha-tensor shows good
agreement with that obtained by Racine et al. 2011, who did not include
derivatives of the mean-field in their fit, as well as with the alpha-tensor
extracted by Augustson et al. 2015 from a distinct ASH MHD simulation. The
isotropic part of the turbulent magnetic diffusivity tensor beta is positive
definite and reaches values of 5.0x10^7 m2s-1 in the middle of the convecting
fluid layers. The spatial variations of both alpha_phiphi and beta_phiphi
component are well reproduced by expressions obtained under the SOCA, with a
good matching of amplitude requiring a turbulent correlation time about five
times smaller than the estimated turnover time of the small-scale turbulent
flow. We find the magnetic quenching of the alpha-effect to be driven primarily
by a reduction of the small-scale flow's kinetic helicity, with variations of
the current helicity playing a lesser role in most locations in the simulation
domain. Our measurements of turbulent diffusivity quenching are restricted to
the beta_phiphi component, but indicate a weaker quenching, by a factor of
1.36, than of the alpha effect, which in our simulation drops by a factor of
three between the minimum and maximum phases of the magnetic cycle.

as a gas of dissipative, rigid mass points, it is very helpful take grains as a
thermal solid that has been sliced and diced. (3) General principles that

increased with the chemical potential, which is consistent with the fact that
the particle density is essentially the superfluid density for zero temperature

variations. However, an increase in strength of the emission is seen before
periastron, following a 1/D relative trend, where D is the separation between
both components. This increase is rapidly followed by a decline due to strong
absorption as the Wolf-Rayet (WR) comes in front. The fitted local absorption
value appears to be coherent with a mass-loss rate of about 1x10^{-5} M_sol/yr
for the WR component. However, absorption is not the only parameter affecting
the X-ray emission at periastron as even the hard X-ray emission decreases,
suggesting a possible collapse of the colliding wind region near to or onto the
photosphere of the companion just before or at periastron. An eclipse may
appear as another potential scenario, but it would be in apparent contradiction
with several lines of evidence, notably the width of the dip in the X-ray light
curve and the absence of variations in the UV light curve. Afterwards, the
emission slowly recovers, with a strong hysteresis effect. The observed
behaviour is compatible with predictions from general wind-wind collision

practice, and various concepts on how to define the robustness of a solution
have been suggested. The idea of recoverable robustness requires that a
solution can be recovered to a feasible one as soon as the realized scenario
becomes known. The usual approach in the literature is to minimize the
objective function value of the recovered solution in the nominal or in the
worst case.
  As the recovery itself is also costly, there is a trade-off between the
recovery costs and the solution value obtained; we study both, the recovery
costs and the solution value in the worst case in a biobjective setting.
  To this end, we assume that the recovery costs can be described by a metric.
We demonstrate that this leads to a location planning problem, bringing
together two fields of research which have been considered separate so far.
  We show how weakly Pareto efficient solutions to this biobjective problem can
be computed by minimizing the recovery costs for a fixed worst-case objective
function value and present approaches for the case of linear and quasiconvex
problems for finite uncertainty sets. We furthermore derive cases in which the
size of the uncertainty set can be reduced without changing the set of Pareto
efficient solutions.

using Deconvolutional Networks (DNs). Several constraints limit the practical
performance of DNs in this context: firstly, the paucity of existing pixel-wise
labelled training data, and secondly, the memory constraints of embedded
hardware, which rule out the practical use of state-of-the-art DN architectures
such as fully convolutional networks (FCN). To address the first constraint, we
introduce a Multi-Domain Road Scene Semantic Segmentation (MDRS3) dataset,
aggregating data from six existing densely and sparsely labelled datasets for
training our models, and two existing, separate datasets for testing their
generalisation performance. We show that, while MDRS3 offers a greater volume
and variety of data, end-to-end training of a memory efficient DN does not
yield satisfactory performance. We propose a new training strategy to overcome
this, based on (i) the creation of a best-possible source network (S-Net) from
the aggregated data, ignoring time and memory constraints; and (ii) the
transfer of knowledge from S-Net to the memory-efficient target network
(T-Net). We evaluate different techniques for S-Net creation and T-Net
transferral, and demonstrate that training a constrained deconvolutional
network in this manner can unlock better performance than existing training
approaches. Specifically, we show that a target network can be trained to
achieve improved accuracy versus an FCN despite using less than 1\% of the
memory. We believe that our approach can be useful beyond automotive scenarios
where labelled data is similarly scarce or fragmented and where practical
constraints exist on the desired model size. We make available our network
models and aggregated multi-domain dataset for reproducibility.

Kelvin-Helmholtz instability upon various physical parameters, including
viscosity, width of sheared layer, flow speed, and magnetic field strength. In
most cases, a multi-vortex phase exists between the initial growth phase and
final single-vortex phase. The parametric study shows that the evolutionary
properties, such as phase duration and vortex dynamics, are generally sensitive
to these parameters except in certain regimes. An interesting result is that
for supersonic flows, the phase durations and saturation of velocity growth
approach constant values asymptotically as the sonic Mach number increases. We
confirm that the linear coupling between magnetic field and Kelvin-Helmholtz
modes is negligible if the magnetic field is weak enough. The morphological
behaviour suggests that the multi-vortex coalescence might be driven by the
underlying wave-wave interaction. Based on these results, we make a preliminary
discussion about several events observed in the solar corona. The numerical
models need to be further improved to make a practical diagnostic of the

when the attractive interaction strength $|u|$ is larger than some critical
value $|u_{c}|$ because the density of states vanishes at Dirac points.
Disorders enhance the low-energy density of states but meanwhile shorten the
lifetime of fermions, which tend to promote and suppress superconductivity,
respectively. To determine which of the two competing effects wins, we study
the interplay of Cooper pairing interaction and disorder scattering by means of
renormalization group method. We consider three types of disorders, including
random mass, random gauge potential, and random chemical potential, and show
that the first two suppress superconductivity. In particular, the critical BCS
coupling $|u_{c}|$ is increased to certain larger value if the system contains
only random mass or random gauge potential, which makes the onset of
superconductivity more difficult. In the case of random chemical potential, the
effective disorder parameter flows to the strong coupling regime, where the
perturbation expansion breaks down and cannot provide a clear answer concerning
the fate of superconductivity. When different types of disorder coexist in one
system, their strength parameters all flow to strong couplings. In the strong
coupling regime, the perturbative renormalization group method becomes invalid,
and one needs to employ other methods to treat the disorder effects. We perform
a simple gap equation analysis of the impact of random chemical potential on
superconductivity by using the Abrikosov-Gorkov diagrammatic approach, and also
briefly discuss the possible generalization of this approach.

$s$-channel $Y(4630)$ meson exchange is taken into account. For the total cross
sections, the $D^0$ and $D^{*0}$ mesons provide minor background contributions,
while the $Y(4630)$ state gives a clear peak structure with the magnitude of 10

that the reaction of $p\bar{p}\rightarrow\Lambda_c\bar{\Lambda}_c$ can be used

exchanges, and a $J^P = 3/2^-$ resonance, which describes the low energy
$\gamma p \to \phi p$ LEPS data well, including the peak in the forward
differential cross section.
  The calculation is done up to double rescatterings, with the spin dependence
of the elementary $\gamma N \to \phi N$ amplitude retained throughout the
calculation. The Fermi motion and final-state interactions (FSI) are all
properly treated as prescribed by realistic nucleon-nucleon interaction. The
couplings of the resonance to $\gamma n$ and $\phi n$ channels are estimated
with the help of a constituent quark model. The main features of the LEPS and
CLAS data are described reasonably well except for some quantitative
discrepancies at very low energies and low momentum transfers regions. It is
found that contributions of Fermi motion, $pn$ FSI, and resonance are all
indispensable in bridging the differences between the single-scattering results
and the data. The off-shell rescattering is found to be important as it cancels
out a large portion of the on-shell contribution. The discrepancies at low
momentum transfer region might be related to the binning size of the data. No
peak is found to be associated with the weak resonance as it gets smeared out
by the Fermi motion and FSI with deuterium target. The problem at very low
energy region hints at the possible contributions from other mechanisms and
should be investigated in depth with the use of recent high statistics $\gamma

external factors: the expert advice, the lack of information or an information

to follow them significantly decreases when subjects spends more time to take a

carries information from the source to the destination is a physically degraded
version of the link that carries information from the source to the relay. The
source and the relay are subject to expected power constraints. The
$\varepsilon$-capacity of the channel is characterized and it is strictly
larger than the capacity for $\varepsilon>0$, which implies that the channel
does not possess the strong converse property. The proof of the achievability
part is based on several key ideas: block Markov coding which is used in the
classical decode-forward strategy, power control for Gaussian channels under
expected power constraints, and a careful scaling between the block size and
the total number of block uses. The converse part is proved by first
establishing two non-asymptotic lower bounds on the error probability, which
are derived from the type-II errors of some binary hypothesis tests.
Subsequently, each lower bound is simplified by conditioning on an event
related to the power of some linear combination of the codewords transmitted by
the source and the relay. Lower and upper bounds on the second-order term of
the optimal coding rate in terms of blocklength and error probability are also
obtained.

inflation continues, the initial bulge grows continually in diameter until it
reaches a critical size and then propagates in both directions. The bulging
solution before propagation starts is of the solitary-wave type, whereas the
propagating bulging solution is of the kink-wave type. The stability, with
respect to axially symmetric perturbations, of both the solitary-wave type and
the kink-wave type solutions is studied by computing the Evans function using
the compound matrix method. It is found that when the inflation is
pressure-controlled, the Evans function has a single non-negative real root and
this root tends to zero only when the initiation pressure or the propagation
pressure is approached. Thus, the kink-wave type solution is probably stable

structural properties of networks that guarantee that random graphs having
these properties are geometric. Specifically we show that random graphs in
which expected degree and clustering of every node are fixed to some constants
are equivalent to random geometric graphs on the real line, if clustering is
sufficiently strong. Large numbers of triangles, homogeneously distributed
across all nodes as in real networks, are thus a consequence of network

construction methods and algorithms in this area. Quantities of interatomic
potential models have been proposed and parameterized with various methods,
such as analytic method, force-matching approach and multi-object optimization
method, in order to make the potentials more transferable. Without apparently
lowing precisions for describing the target system, potentials of fewer fitting
parameters (FPs) are somewhat more physically reasonable. Thus, studying
methods of reducing FP number is helpful to understand the underline physics of
simulated systems and generalize the construction methods to other similar
systems. However, few reported works concentrate on methods of reducing the
number of FPs without affecting precisions. In this work, the methods of
reducing the FP number while keeping the precisions are discussed from two
aspects. Firstly, the physical ideas of constructions of the embedded-atom
method (EAM) potential model are modified to make the potential more robust,
flexible and scalable without introducing too many FPs.Secondly, the smaller
reference data set (SRD), compared with the target reference database for
describing the mechanical behaviors of aluminum, is employed in our
construction procedures.

computation to an untrusted quantum server while fully maintaining privacy
(blindness) is one of the big open questions in quantum cryptography. Both yes
and no answers have important practical and theoretical consequences, and the
question seems genuinely hard. The state-of-the-art approaches to securely
delegating quantum computation, without exception, rely on granting the client
modest quantum powers, or on additional, non-communicating, quantum servers. In
this work, we consider the single server setting, and push the boundaries of
the minimal devices of the client, which still allow for blind quantum
computation. Our approach is based on the observation that, in many blind
quantum computing protocols, the ""quantum"" part of the protocol, from the
clients perspective, boils down to the establishing classical-quantum
correlations (independent from the computation) between the client and the
server, following which the steering of the computation itself requires only
classical communication. Here, we abstract this initial preparation phase,
specifically for the Universal Blind Quantum Computation protocol of Broadbent,
Fitzsimons and Kashefi. We identify sufficient criteria on the powers of the
client, which still allow for secure blind quantum computation. We work in a
universally composable framework, and provide a series of protocols, where each
step reduces the number of differing states the client needs to be able to
prepare. As the limit of such reductions, we show that the capacity to prepare
just two pure states, which have an arbitrarily high overlap (thus are
arbitrarily close to identical), suffices for efficient and secure blind
quantum computation.

approach able to improve the sensitivity of the current experiments is the
rejection of $\alpha$ interactions, that represents the dominant background

contrast to electrons, they do not emit Cherenkov light. Nevertheless, the very
low amount of detected Cherenkov light undermines the complete rejection of
$\alpha$ background. In this paper we compare the results obtained in previous
measurements of the TeO$_2$ light yield with a detailed Monte Carlo simulation
able to reproduce the number of Cherenkov photons produced in $\beta/\gamma$
interactions within the calorimeter and their propagation in the experimental
set-up. We demonstrate that the light yield detectable from a
$5\times5\times5$~cm$^{3}$ TeO$_2$ bolometer can be increased by up to 60% by
increasing the surface roughness of the crystal and improving the light
detector design. Moreover, we study the possibility to disentangle $\alpha$,
$\beta$ and $\gamma$ interactions, which represent the ultimate background
source. Unfortunately $\gamma$ rejection is not feasible but $\alpha$ rejection
can be achieved exploiting high sensitivity light detectors.

special techniques for reducing the computational costs of the algorithm. The
analysis of the computational complexity of the algorithm shows that the
algorithm is much faster than traditional Fourier transform. Our algorithm can

shown great potential in recent work for both estimation and de-noising of

has received relatively little attention within the density ridge approach,
despite being an integral part of manifold learning in general. This paper
proposes two novel algorithms for unwrapping manifolds based on estimated

respectively. The methods of unwrapping are founded in the realization that
both principal curves and principal surfaces will have inherent local maxima of
the probability density function. Following this observation, coordinate
systems that follow the shape of the manifold can be computed by following the
integral curves of the gradient flow of a kernel density estimate on the
manifold. Furthermore, since integral curves of the gradient flow of a kernel
density estimate is inherently local, we propose to stitch together local
coordinate systems using parallel transport along the manifold. We provide
numerical experiments on both real and synthetic data that illustrates clear
and intuitive unwrapping results comparable to state-of-the-art manifold
learning algorithms.

through the evolution of an event $x^\mu(\tau)$. By admitting unconstrained
commutation relations between the positions and velocities, the associated
electromagnetic gauge fields are in general dependent on the parameter $\tau$,
which plays the role of time in Newtonian mechanics. Standard Maxwell theory
emerges from this system as a $\tau$-independent equilibrium limit. In this
paper, we calculate the $\tau$-dependent field induced by an arbitrarily
evolving event, and study the long-range radiation part, which is seen to be an
on-shell plane wave of the Maxwell type. Following Dirac's method, we obtain an
expression for the finite part of the self-interaction, which leads to the ALD
equation that generalizes the Lorentz force. This third-order differential
equation is then converted to an integro-differential equation, identical to
the standard Maxwell expression, except for the $\tau$-dependence of the field.
By studying this $\tau$-dependence in detail, we show that field can be removed
from the integration, so that the Lorentz force depends only on the
instantaneous external field and an integral over dynamical variables of the
event evolution. In this form, pre-acceleration of the event by future values
of the field is not present.

range of 0.16 to 0.7. This is the introductory paper of a series presenting the
sample selection, photometric and spectroscopic observations and data
reduction. Photometric data in different passbands were taken for eight galaxy
clusters at Las Campanas Observatory; three clusters at Cerro Tololo
Interamerican Observatory; and eight clusters at the Gemini Observatory.
Spectroscopic data were collected for only four galaxy clusters using Gemini
telescopes. With the photometry, the galaxies were defined based on the
star-galaxy separation taking into account photometric parameters. For each
galaxy cluster, the catalogues contain the PSF and aperture magnitudes of
galaxies within the 90\% completeness limit. They are used together with
structural parameters to study the galaxy morphology and to estimate
photometric redshifts. With the spectroscopy, the derived galaxy velocity
dispersion of our clusters ranged from 507 km~s$^{-1}$ for [VMF98]022 to 775
km~s$^{-1}$ for [VMF98]097 with signs of substructure. Cluster membership has
been extensively discussed taking into account spectroscopic and photometric
redshift estimates. In this sense, members are the galaxies within a projected
radius of 0.75 Mpc from the X-ray mission peak and with cluster centric
velocities smaller than the cluster velocity dispersion or 6000 km~s$^{-1}$,

the galaxy luminosity function and cluster dynamics.

case in Stueckelberg-Horwitz electromagnetic theory. In this theory, spacetime
events $x^\mu(\tau)$ evolve in an unconstrained 8-dimensional phase space,
interacting through five $\tau$-dependent gauge fields induced by the current
densities associated with their evolutions. The chronological time $\tau$ was
introduced as an independent evolution parameter in order to free the
laboratory clock $x^0$ to evolve alternately 'forward' and 'backward' in time
according to the sign of the energy, thus providing a classical implementation
of the Feynman-Stueckelberg interpretation of pair creation/annihilation. The
resulting theory differs in its underlying mechanics from conventional
electromagnetism, but coincides with Maxwell theory in an equilibrium limit.
  After a brief review of Stueckelberg-Horwitz electrodynamics, we obtain the
field produced by an event in uniform motion and verify that it satisfies the
field equations. We study this field in the rest frame of the event, where it
depends explicitly on coordinate time $x^0$ and the parameter $\tau$, as well
as spatial distance $R$. Calculating with this generalized Coulomb field, we
demonstrate how Gauss's theorem and Stoke's theorem apply in 4D spacetime, and
obtain the fields associated with a charged line and a charged sheet. Finally,
we use the field of the charged sheet to study a static event in the vicinity
of a potential barrier. In all of these cases, we observe a small transfer of
mass from the field to the particle. It is seen that for an event in the field
of an oppositely charged sheet of sufficient density, the event can reverse
time direction, providing a specific model for pair phenomena.

associated with specific scattering processes, can be exploited for different
scopes. In this work, the parquet decomposition is used to unravel the
underlying physics of non-perturbative numerical calculations. We show the
specific example of dynamical mean field theory (DMFT) and its cluster
extensions (DCA) applied to the Hubbard model at half-filling and with hole
doping: These techniques allow for a simultaneous determination of two-particle
vertex functions and self-energies, and hence, for an essentially ""exact""
parquet decomposition at the single-site or at the cluster level. Our
calculations show that the self-energies in the underdoped regime are dominated
by spin scattering processes, consistent with the conclusions obtained by means
of the fluctuation diagnostics approach [Phys. Rev. Lett. 114, 236402 (2015)].
However, differently from the latter approach, the parquet procedure displays
important changes with increasing interaction: Even for relatively moderate
couplings, well before the Mott transition, singularities appear in different
terms, with the notable exception of the predominant spin-channel. We explain
precisely how these singularities, which partly limit the utility of the
parquet decomposition, and - more generally - of parquet-based algorithms, are
never found in the fluctuation diagnostics procedure. Finally, by a more
refined analysis, we link the occurrence of the parquet singularities in our
calculations to a progressive suppression of charge fluctuations and the

Aharonovich have proposed a simple mechanism by which a particle traveling
below light speed almost everywhere may exhibit a transit time that suggests
superluminal motion. This mechanism, which requires precise measurement of the
particle velocity, involves a subtle perturbation affecting the particle's
recorded time coordinate caused by virtual pair processes. The Stueckelberg
framework is particularly well suited to such problems, because it permits pair
creation/annihilation at the classical level. In this paper, we study a
trajectory of the type proposed by Horwitz and Aharonovich, and derive the
Maxwell 4-vector potential associated with the motion. We show that the
resulting fields carry a signature associated with the apparent superluminal
motion, providing an independent test for the mechanism that does not require
direct observation of the trajectory, except at the detector.

Further, we bound the efficiency loss under profit maximizing prices, showing
that there is a strong alignment between profit and efficiency in practical

practice due to supply shortages; thus platforms have a strong incentive to
encourage sharing via subsidies. We provide an analytic characterization of

(EOS) is explored in simulations of failed core-collapse supernova explosions.
Therefore the nuclear EOS is extended via a one-parameter excluded volume
description for baryons, taking into account their finite and increasing volume
with increasing density in excess of saturation density. Parameters are
selected such that the resulting supernova EOS represent extreme cases, with
high pressure variations at supersaturation density which feature extreme stiff
and soft EOS variants of the reference case, i.e. without excluded volume
corrections. Unlike in the interior of neutron stars with central densities in
excess of several times saturation density, central densities of core-collapse
supernovae reach only slightly above saturation density. Hence, the impact of
the supersaturation density EOS on the supernova dynamics as well as the
neutrino signal is found to be negligible. It is mainly determined from the
low- and intermediate-density domain, which is left unmodified within this
generalized excluded volume approach.

presents two closely related problems: (1) What accounts for the stability of
the measured masses of the known particles? (2) Under what circumstances can
real particles evolve sufficiently off-shell to account for mass changing
phenomena such as flavor-changing neutrino interactions and low energy nuclear
reactions? To approach these questions, we introduce a constant $c_5$

differentiation procedure, suggested by Severa, that maps higher groupoids to
$L_\infty$-algebroids. Generalising this procedure, we define connections for
higher groupoid bundles. As an application, we obtain six-dimensional
superconformal field theories via a Penrose-Ward transform of higher groupoid
bundles over a twistor space. This construction reduces the search for
non-Abelian self-dual tensor field equations in six dimensions to a search for
the appropriate (higher) gauge structure. The treatment aims to be accessible

This discussion is mainly influenced by two specific scenarios of physics which
assume either a (pseudo-)scalar or a tensor resonance, but these estimates can
be used in most scenarios. I envisage either a photon collider, which has a
guaranteed signal with the LHC observation, or a standard e+e- collider, more
straightforward to implement. After a detailed study of the heavy graviton
scenario, I conclude that at a TeV LC, high accuracy measurements, including
rare modes, allow to unambiguously establish the origin of this resonance. Also
envisaged in some detail is a radion scenario which illustrates the production
of a scalar. The role of an LC for precision measurements on Higgs and top

Thus, information utilization is critical to the performance of heuristics.
However, the concept of information utilization has remained vague and abstract
because there is no reliable metric to reflect the extent to which the
information about the objective function is utilized by heuristic algorithms.
In this paper, the metric of information utilization ratio (IUR) is defined,
which is the ratio of the utilized information quantity over the acquired
information quantity in the search process. The IUR proves to be well-defined.
Several examples of typical heuristic algorithms are given to demonstrate the

origin of the observed plateaus in the retraction force as a function of
tip-surface distance, showing that they ensue from the tip geometrical
features. In lateral sliding, the model exhibits a wide range of dynamic
behaviors ranging from smooth sliding to stick-slip at different velocities,
with the average friction force determined by the characteristic
formation/rupture rates of the complexes. In particular, it is shown that for
some molecular complexes friction can become almost constant over a wide range
of velocities. Also, we show the possibility to exploit ageing effect through
slide-hold-slide experiments, in order to infer the characteristic formation
rate. Finally, our model predicts a novel ""anti-ageing"" effect which is
characterized by a decrease of static friction force with the hold time. Such

propose a new technique to account for model inadequacy that is both
probabilistic and physically meaningful. A stochastic inadequacy operator
$\mathcal{S}$ is introduced which is embedded in the ODEs describing the
evolution of chemical species concentrations and which respects certain
physical constraints such as conservation laws. The parameters of $\mathcal{S}$
are governed by probability distributions, which in turn are characterized by a
set of hyperparameters. The model parameters and hyperparameters are calibrated
using high-dimensional hierarchical Bayesian inference. We apply the method to

combustion.

functions of a dichotomic variable Q appearing in Leggett-Garg type
inequalities. The protocols measure solely whether Q has the same or different
sign at the ends of a given time interval. They are inspired, in part, by a
decoherent histories analysis of the two-time histories of Q although the
protocols are ultimately expressed in macrorealistic form independent of
quantum theory. The first type involves an ancilla coupled to the system with
two sequential CNOT gates, and the two-time histories of the system are
determined in a single final time measurement of the ancilla. It is
non-invasive for special choices of initial system states and partially
invasive for more general choices. Modified Leggett-Garg type inequalities
which accommodate the partial invasiveness are discussed. The quantum picture
of the protocol shows that for certain choices of primary system initial state
the protocol is undetectable with respect to final system state measurements,
although it is still invasive at intermediate times. This invasiveness can be
reduced with different choices of ancilla states and the protocol is then
similar in flavour to a weak measurement. The second type of protocol is based
on the fact that the behaviour of Q over a time interval can be determined from
knowledge of the dynamics together with a measurement of certain initial (or
final) data. Its quantum version corresponds to the known fact that when sets
of histories are decoherent, their probabilities may be expressed in terms of a
record projector, hence the two-time histories in which Q has the same or
different sign can be determined by a single projective measurement. The
resulting protocol resembles the decay-type protocol proposed by Huelga and
collaborators (which is non-invasive but requires a stationarity assumption).

environment with different `senses' (e.g., seeing and hearing) but also infer
the world's conditional (or even causal) relations and corresponding
uncertainty. The past decade has seen major advances in many perception tasks
such as visual object recognition and speech recognition using deep learning
models. For higher-level inference, however, probabilistic graphical models
with their Bayesian nature are still more powerful and flexible. In recent
years, Bayesian deep learning has emerged as a unified probabilistic framework
to tightly integrate deep learning and Bayesian models. In this general
framework, the perception of text or images using deep learning can boost the
performance of higher-level inference and in turn, the feedback from the
inference process is able to enhance the perception of text or images. This
survey provides a comprehensive introduction to Bayesian deep learning and
reviews its recent applications on recommender systems, topic models, control,
etc. Besides, we also discuss the relationship and differences between Bayesian
deep learning and other related topics such as Bayesian treatment of neural

processes in generating extreme events is of critical importance in many
fields, from forecasting extreme meteorological events to the catastrophic
failure of materials and in the Earth. Here we investigate the statistics of
record-breaking events in the time series of crackling noise generated by local
rupture events during the compressive failure of porous materials. The events
are generated by computer simulations of the uni-axial compression of
cylindrical samples in a discrete element model of sedimentary rocks that
closely resemble those of real experiments. The number of records grows
initially as a decelerating power law of the number of events, followed by an
acceleration immediately prior to failure. We demonstrate the existence of a
characteristic record rank k^* which separates the two regimes of the time
evolution. Up to this rank deceleration occurs due to the effect of random
disorder. Record breaking then accelerates towards macroscopic failure, when
physical interactions leading to spatial and temporal correlations dominate the
location and timing of local ruptures. Sub-sequences of bursts between
consecutive records are characterized by a power law size distribution with an
exponent which decreases as failure is approached. High rank records are
preceded by bursts of increasing size and waiting time between consecutive
events and they are followed by a relaxation process. As a reference, surrogate
time series are generated by reshuffling the crackling bursts. The record
statistics of the uncorrelated surrogates agrees very well with the
corresponding predictions of independent identically distributed random
variables, which confirms that the temporal and spatial correlation of cracking
bursts are responsible for the observed unique behaviour.

heat equation $u_t-\Delta u= |u|^{p-1}u$ in the whole space $R^n$, with $n\ge
3$ and supercritical power $p>(n+2)/(n-2)$. This is proved {\rmb without any
radial symmetry or sign assumptions}, unlike in all the previously known
results for the Cauchy problem, and under spatial decay assumptions on the
initial data that are essentially optimal in view of the known
counter-examples. Moreover, we show that any global classical solution has to
decay in time faster than $t^{-1/(p-1)}$, which is also optimal and in contrast
with the subcritical case.
  The proof relies on nontrivial modifications of techniques developed by Chou,
Du and Zheng [Calc. Var. PDE 2007] and by Blatt and Struwe [IMRN, 2015] for the
case of convex bounded domains. They are based on weighted energy estimates of
Giga-Kohn type, combined with an analysis of the equation in a suitable Morrey
space. We in particular simplify the approach of Blatt and Struwe by
establishing and using a result on global existence and decay for small initial
data in the critical Morrey space $M^{2,4/(p-1)}(R^n)$, rather than
$\eps$-regularity in a parabolic Morrey space. This method actually works for
any convex, bounded or unbounded, smooth domain, but at the same time captures
some of the specific behaviors associated with the case of the whole space
$R^n$.
  As a consequence we also prove that the set of initial data producing global
solutions is open in suitable topologies, and we show that the so-called
""borderline"" global weak solutions blow up in finite time and then become
classical again and decay as $t\to\infty$. All these results put into light the
key role played by the Morrey space $M^{2,4/(p-1)}$ in the understanding of the
structure of the set of global solutions for $p>p_S$.

large oscillator strength to the confined electromagnetic mode of an optical
microcavity. In this work we demonstrate that strong/ultra-strong coupling can
also take place in the absence of optical confinement. We have studied the
non-perturbative spontaneous emission of collective excitations in a dense
two-dimensional electron gas that superradiantly decays into free space. By
using a quantum model based on the input-output formalism, we have derived the
linear optical properties of the coupled system and demonstrated that its
eigenstates are mixed light-matter particles, like in any system displaying
strong or ultra-strong light-matter interaction. Moreover, we have shown that
in the ultra-strong coupling regime, i.e. when the radiative broadening is
comparable to the matter excitation energy, the commonly used rotating-wave and
Markov approximations yield unphysical results. Finally, the input-output
formalism has allowed us to prove that Kirchhoff's law, describing thermal
emission properties, applies to our system in all the light-matter coupling

Nebulae (PNe) shaping via binary interaction. We explore whether tidal
interaction with a companion can spin up the AGB envelope. To do so we have
selected binary systems with main sequence masses of 2.5 \Mo and of 0.8 \Mo and
evolve them allowing initial separations of 5, 6, 7, and 8 AU. The binary
stellar evolution models have been computed all the way to the PNe formation
phase or until Roche lobe overflow (RLOF) is reached, whatever happens first.
We show that with initial separations of 7 and 8 AU, the binary avoids entering
into RLOF, and the AGB star reaches moderate rotational velocities at the
surface ($\sim 3.5 $ and $\sim 2 $ \kms respectively) during the inter-pulse
phases, but after the thermal pulses it drops to a final rotational velocity of
only $\sim 0.03 $ \kms. For the closest binary separations explored, 5 and 6
AU, the AGB star reaches rotational velocities of $\sim 6 $ and $\sim 4 $ \kms
respectively when the RLOF is initiated. We conclude that the detached binary
models that avoid entering the RLOF phase during the AGB will not shape bipolar
PNe, since the acquired angular momentum is lost via the wind during the last
two thermal pulses. This study rules out tidal spin-up in non-contact binaries
as a sufficient condition to form bipolar PNe.

operational matrix method and the exponential spline interpolation is proposed

derived based on sine-cosine wavelet functions, which helps to convert the
underlying equation into a linear algebraic system. Then, an exponential
B-spline method is introduced in spatial direction. On selecting a set of

  New Declarative Method to Update Object Databases",,,,,"cs.DB","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In this article I introduce a new communication theory for complex
information represented as a direct graph of nodes. In addition, I introduce an
application for the theory, a new radical method, embed, that can be used to
update object databases declaratively. The embed method revolutionizes updating
of object databases. One embed method call can replace dozens of lines of
complicated updating code in a traditional client program of an object
database, which is a huge improvement. As a declarative method the embed method
takes only one natural parameter, the root object of a modified object
structure in the run-time memory, which makes it extremely easy to use.The
communication theory behind the embed method states that modified complex
information represented as a directed graph of nodes can always be transferred
back to its original system in an exact and meaningful way. The theory can also
have additional applications since today information often has a network or
directed graph like structure and it often evolves or it is maintained. The
embed method applies the communication theory by modeling the object database
and a modified object structure in the run-time memory as directed graphs of
nodes without any artificial limitations. For example, different kinds of
circular substructures and their modifications are allowed. Persistence in the
object database is defined in a well known and accepted way, by reachability
from persistent root objects. The embed method also removes structures of
garbage objects from the object database if any appear during the update
operation, leaving the database in a consistent state. The embed method applies
reference counting techniques. It understands local topology of the object
database, avoiding examining unrelated objects in the database. For these
reasons, the embed method is efficient and it scales for databases of different
sizes.

  abstract is published in the conference proceedings",,,,"q-bio.QM cs.CE","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Aptamers, short synthetic RNA/DNA molecules binding specific targets with
high affinity and specificity, are utilized in an increasing spectrum of
bio-medical applications. Aptamers are identified in vitro via the Systematic
Evolution of Ligands by Exponential Enrichment (SELEX) protocol. SELEX selects
binders through an iterative process that, starting from a pool of random
ssDNA/RNA sequences, amplifies target-affine species through a series of
selection cycles. HT-SELEX, which combines SELEX with high throughput
sequencing, has recently transformed aptamer development and has opened the
field to even more applications. HT-SELEX is capable of generating over half a
billion data points, challenging computational scientists with the task of
identifying aptamer properties such as sequence structure motifs that determine
binding. While currently available motif finding approaches suggest partial
solutions to this question, none possess the generality or scalability required
for HT-SELEX data, and they do not take advantage of important properties of
the experimental procedure.
  We present AptaTRACE, a novel approach for the identification of
sequence-structure binding motifs in HT-SELEX derived aptamers. Our approach
leverages the experimental design of the SELEX protocol and identifies
sequence-structure motifs that show a signature of selection. Because of its
unique approach, AptaTRACE can uncover motifs even when these are present in
only a minuscule fraction of the pool. Due to these features, our method can
help to reduce the number of selection cycles required to produce aptamers with
the desired properties, thus reducing cost and time of this rather expensive
procedure. The performance of the method on simulated and real data indicates
that AptaTRACE can detect sequence-structure motifs even in highly challenging
data.

resonating within them move slightly towards their narrow ends (the emdrive).
Standard physics has no explanation for this and an error has not yet been
found. It is shown here that this effect can be predicted by assuming that the
inertial mass of the photons in the cavity is caused by Unruh radiation, whose
wavelengths must fit exactly within the cavity, using a theory already applied
successfully to astrophysical anomalies such as galaxy rotation where the Unruh
waves have to fit within the Hubble scale. In the emdrive this means that more
Unruh waves are allowed at the wide end, leading to a greater inertial mass for
the photons there, and to conserve momentum the cavity must move towards its
narrow end, as observed. The model predicts thrusts of: 3.8, 149, 7.3, 0.23,
0.57, 0.11, 0.64 and 0.02 mN compared with the observed thrusts of: 16, 147, 9,

equal to the diameter of the small end of the cavity, the thrust should be
reversed.

tensor and currents is a standard tool in quantum field theory (QFT) to
eliminate infinite vacuum expectation values (v.e.v.) However, for fermionic
expressions these infinite terms are due to anti-particles only. This exposes
an asymmetry in standard QFT, which can be traced back to a bias towards
particles in the Dirac bra-ket notation. To counter this bias a new ordering
principle (called the $\mathbb{R}$-product) is required which restores the
symmetry (or rather duality) between particles and anti-particles and
eliminates the infinite v.e.v. While this $\mathbb{R}$-product was already used
in a bound-state application, this paper aims to give it a more general
foundation and analyze its overall impact in QFT.
  For boson fields the particle bias is hidden and the fields must first be
expanded into bilinear particle-anti-particle fermion operators. This new
representation also leads to vanishing v.e.v.'s and avoids some common
technical problems in the quantization of vector fields, while it admits new
constant contributions that mimic the Higgs mechanism without unacceptable
contributions to the cosmological constant.
  Since the $\mathbb{R}$-product does not apply between operators belonging to
different space- time coordinates (e.g. propagators and vacuum condensates),
most standard QFT calculations remain unaffected by this new principle,
preserving those quantitative successes. The boson propagator also retains a
standard bosonic form despite the fermionic representation. However, the
foundations of QFT are affected strongly as the new principle suggests that the
Standard Model is an effective theory built (partly?) on massless bare quarks.

of fields from quantum communications to particle manipulation. Due to their
widespread influence, significant attention has been paid to the methods by
which vortex waves are generated. For example, active phased arrays generate
diverse vortex modes at the cost of electronic complexity and power
consumption. Conversely, analog apertures, such as spiral phase plates,
metasurfaces, and gratings require separate apertures to generate each mode.
Here we present a new class of metamaterial-based acoustic vortex generators,
which are both geometrically and electronically simple, and topologically
tunable. Our metamaterial approach generates vortex waves by wrapping an
acoustic leaky wave antenna back upon itself. Exploiting the antennas
frequency-varying refractive index, we demonstrate experimentally and
analytically that this analog structure generates both integer, and non-integer
vortex modes. The metamaterial design makes the aperture compact and can thus
be integrated into high-density systems.

distributions. These distributions show that the first three recalls come from
the emptying of working memory, recalls 6 and above come from a second stage
and the 4th and 5th recalls are mixtures of the two. A discontinuity, a rounded
step function, is shown to exist in the fitted linear slope of the recall
distributions as the recall shifts from the emptying of working memory
(positive slope) to the second stage (negative slope). The discontinuity leads
to a first estimate of the capacity of working memory at 4-4.5 items. Working
memory accounts for the recency effect. The primacy effect comes from the
second stage with a contribution also from working memory for short lists (the
first item). The different slopes of the working memory and secondary stages,
and that the two have different functional forms, accounts for the u-shaped
serial position curve. The total recall is shown to be a linear combination of
the content of working memory and items recalled in the second stage with
3.0-3.9 items coming from working memory, a second estimate of the capacity of
working memory. A third, separate upper limit on the capacity of working memory
is found (3.06 items), corresponding to the requirement that the content of
working memory cannot exceed the total recall, item by item. This third limit
presumably corresponds to the least chunked item. This is the best limit on the
capacity of unchunked working memory.

the mean field equation is a linear diffusion with a non constant diffusion
coefficient that models also the geometric Brownian motion and can be studied

solution is represented, for a large class of initial data, by a lognormal
distribution with constant mean value and variance increasing exponentially in
time at a precise rate. The relationship between the kinetic and the diffusion
models allow to introduce an easy-to- implement expression for computing the
