new ab initio theory of temperature-dependent optical absorption spectra and
band gaps in semiconductors and insulators. In that work the zero-point
renormalization and the temperature dependence were obtained by sampling the
nuclear wavefunctions using a stochastic approach. In the present work, we show
that the stochastic sampling can be replaced by fully deterministic supercell
calculations based on a single optimal configuration of the atomic positions.
We demonstrate that a single calculation is able to capture the
temperature-dependent band gap renormalization including quantum nuclear
effects in direct and indirect-gap semiconductors, as well as phonon-assisted
optical absorption in indirect-gap semiconductors. In order to demonstrate this
methodology we calculate from first principles the temperature-dependent
optical absorption spectra and the renormalization of direct and indirect band
gaps in Si, C, and GaAs, and we obtain good agreement with experiment and with
previous calculations. In this work we also establish the formal connection
between the Williams-Lax theory of optical transitions and the related theories
of indirect absorption by Hall, Bardeen, and Blatt, and of
temperature-dependent band structures by Allen and Heine. Furthermore, we
identify an additional band gap renormalization that arises in the case of
degenerate band extrema, and which has not been considered in previous work.
The present methodology enables systematic ab initio calculations of optical
absorption spectra at finite temperature, including both direct and indirect
transitions. This feature will be useful for high-throughput calculations of
optical properties at finite temperature, and for calculating
temperature-dependent optical properties using high-level theories such as GW
and Bethe-Salpeter approaches.

sources such as batch effects and stochastic variation. We used the L1000
platform for large-scale profiling of 978 genes, chosen to be representative of
the genome as whole, across thousands of compound treatments. Here, a method is
described that uses deep learning techniques to convert the expression changes
of the landmark genes into a perturbation barcode that reveals important
features of the underlying data, performing better than the raw data in
revealing important biological insights. The barcode captures compound
structure and target information, in addition to predicting a compound's high
throughput screening promiscuity, to a higher degree than the original data
measurements, indicating that the approach uncovers underlying factors of the
expression data that are otherwise entangled or masked by noise. Furthermore,
we demonstrate that visualizations derived from the perturbation barcode can be
used to more sensitively assign functions to unknown compounds through a

Using the simulation

microchannel the Taylor line swims at an acute angle along a channel wall with
a clearly enhanced swimming speed due to hydrodynamic interactions with the
bounding wall. While in a dilute obstacle lattice swimming speed is also
enhanced, a dense obstacle lattice gives rise to geometric swimming. This new
type of swimming is characterized by a drastically increased swimming speed.
Since the Taylor line has to fit into the free space of the obstacle lattice,
the swimming speed is close to the phase velocity of the bending wave traveling
along the Taylor line. While adjusting its swimming motion within the lattice,
the Taylor line chooses a specific swimming direction, which we classify by a
lattice vector. When plotting the swimming velocity versus the magnitude of the
lattice vector, all our data collapse on a single master curve. Finally, we

On both surfaces, we identify a surface state that forms a large Fermi-arc
emerging out of the bulk electron pocket. Using surface electronic structure
calculations, we show that these Fermi arcs are topologically trivial and that
their existence is independent of the presence of type-II Weyl points in the
bulk band structure. This implies that the observation of surface Fermi arcs
alone does not allow the identification of WTe2 as a topological Weyl

clarify the number of Fermi surface sheets in WTe2.

knowledge between different environmental conditions. Current methods for
comparing microbial communities face important limitations. Those based on
taxonomical or functional assignation rely on a small subset of the sequences
that can be associated to known organisms. On the other hand, de novo methods,
that compare the whole sets of sequences, either do not scale up on ambitious
metagenomic projects or do not provide precise and exhaustive results.
  Methods. These limitations motivated the development of a new de novo
metagenomic comparative method, called Simka. This method computes a large
collection of standard ecological distances by replacing species counts by
k-mer counts. Simka scales-up today's metagenomic projects thanks to a new
parallel k-mer counting strategy on multiple datasets.
  Results. Experiments on public Human Microbiome Project datasets demonstrate
that Simka captures the essential underlying biological structure. Simka was
able to compute in a few hours both qualitative and quantitative ecological
distances on hundreds of metagenomic samples (690 samples, 32 billions of
reads). We also demonstrate that analyzing metagenomes at the k-mer level is
highly correlated with extremely precise de novo comparison techniques which
rely on all-versus-all sequences alignment strategy or which are based on
taxonomic profiling.

a photon-limited signal-to-noise ratio of $\sim$50. Our observations can rule
out a larger than 10% variation in the column of CH$_3$D below 50 km. The
preferential condensation of the heavy isotopologues will fractionate methane
by reducing CH$_3$D in the remaining vapor, and therefore these observations
place limits on the amount of condensation that occurs in the troposphere.
While previous estimates of CH$_3$D fractionation on Titan have estimated an
upper limit of -6 per mil, assuming a solid condensate, we consider more recent
laboratory data for the equilibrium fractionation over liquid methane, and use
a Rayleigh distillation model to calculate fractionation in an ascending parcel
of air that is following a moist adiabat. We find that deep, precipitating
convection can enhance the fractionation of the remaining methane vapor by -10
to -40 per mil, depending on the final temperature of the rising parcel. By
relating fractionation of our reference parcel model to the pressure level
where the moist adiabat achieves the required temperature, we argue that the
measured methane fractionation constrains the outflow level for a deep
convective event. Observations with a factor of at least 4 to 6 times larger
signal-to-noise are required to detect this amount of fractionation, depending
on the altitude range over which the outflow from deep convection occurs.

polarization in superlattices of SrTiO$_3$ (STO) and LaCrO$_3$ (LCO) is
demonstrated. By controlling the interfaces between polar LCO and non-polar
STO, polarization is induced throughout the STO layers of the superlattice.
Using x-ray absorption near-edge spectroscopy and aberration-corrected scanning
transmission electron microscopy displacements of the Ti cations off-center

This distortion gives rise to built-in potential gradients within the STO and
LCO layers, as measured by in situ x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. Density
functional theory models explain the mechanisms underlying this behavior,
revealing the existence of both an intrinsic polar distortion and a built-in
electric field, which are due to alternately positively and negatively charged
interfaces in the superlattice. This study paves the way for controllable
polarization for carrier separation in multilayer materials and highlights the
crucial role that interface structure plays in governing such behavior.

definition for projective space and allow for non-trivial weights. On its own,
this extra freedom gives rise to more than enough interesting phenomena, but it
is the fact that weighted projective space arises naturally in the context of
classical algebraic geometry that can be surprising. Using the Riemann-Roch
theorem to calculate l(E,nD) where E is a non-singular cubic curve inside
projective 2-space and D=p is a point in E we obtain a non-negatively graded
ring R(E) by taking the direct sum of the L(E,nD) for n greater than or equal
to 0. This gives rise to an embedding of E inside the weighted projective space
P(1,2,3).
  To understand a space it is always a good idea to look at the things inside
it. The main content of this paper is the introduction and explanation of many
basic concepts of weighted projective space and its varieties. There are
already many brilliant texts on the topic but none of them are aimed at an
audience with only an undergraduate's knowledge of mathematics. This paper
hopes to partially fill this gap whilst maintaining a good balance between
'interesting' and 'simple'.

non-singular 'sufficiently general' plane curves, proved using not much more
than the Riemann-Hurwitz formula.

is studied in the case of the 2-user Z interference channel (Z-IC) with secrecy
constraints at the receivers, on achieving two conflicting goals
simultaneously: mitigating interference and ensuring secrecy. First, the
problem is studied under the linear deterministic model. The achievable schemes
for the deterministic model use a fusion of cooperative precoding and
transmission of a jamming signal. The optimality of the proposed scheme is
established for the deterministic model for all possible parameter settings
using the outer bounds derived by the authors in a previous work. Using the
insights obtained from the deterministic model, a lower bound on the secrecy
capacity region of the 2-user Gaussian Z-IC are obtained. The achievable scheme
in this case uses stochastic encoding in addition to cooperative precoding and
transmission of a jamming signal. The secure sum generalized degrees of freedom
(GDOF) is characterized and shown to be optimal for the weak/moderate
interference regime. It is also shown that the secure sum capacity lies within
2 bits/s/Hz of the outer bound for the weak/moderate interference regime for
all values of the capacity of the cooperative link. Interestingly, in case of
the deterministic model, it is found that there is no penalty on the capacity
region of the Z-IC due to the secrecy constraints at the receivers in the
weak/moderate interference regimes. Similarly, it is found that there is no
loss in the secure sum GDOF for the Gaussian case due to the secrecy constraint
at the receiver, in the weak/moderate interference regimes. The results
highlight the importance of cooperation in facilitating secure communication
over the Z-IC.

observed evolving networks. In this paper, we firstly propose a
structured-dependent index to strengthen the robustness of link prediction

and model the evolutionary dynamics of nodes similarity. Based on the iterative
updating of nodes' network position, the potential trend of evolving networks

communities. These networks are usually defined as static entities, in which
the occurrence of a particular interaction between species is considered fixed
despite the intrinsic dynamics of ecological systems. However, empirical
analysis of the temporal variation of trophic interactions is constrained by
the lack of data with high spatial, temporal, and taxonomic resolution. Here,
we evaluate the spatiotemporal variability of multiple consumer-resource
interactions of large marine networks. The tropic interactions of all of the
analyzed networks had low temporal persistence, which was well described by a
common exponential decay in the rank-frequency relationship of
consumer-resource interactions. This common pattern of low temporal persistence
was evident despite the dissimilarities of environmental conditions among
sites. Between-site rank correlations of frequency of occurrence of
interactions ranged from 0.59 to 0.73. After removing the interactions with
<50% frequency, the between-site correlations decreased to values between 0.60
and 0.28, indicating that low-frequency interactions accounted for the apparent
similarities between sites. Our results showed that the communities studied
were characterized by few persistent interactions and a large number of
transient trophic interactions. We suggest that consumer-resource temporal
asynchrony in addition to varying local environmental conditions and
opportunistic foraging could be among the mechanisms generating the observed
rank-frequency relationship of trophic interactions. Therefore, our results
question the analysis of ecological communities as static and persistent
natural entities and stress the need for strengthening the analysis of temporal

two types of magnetic-field geometries: one where each star is endowed with a
dipole magnetic field extending from the interior into the exterior, as in a
pulsar, and the other where the dipole field is initially confined to the
interior. In both cases the adopted magnetic fields are initially dynamically
unimportant. The merger outcome is a hypermassive neutron star that undergoes
delayed collapse to a black hole (spin parameter $a/M_{\rm BH} \sim 0.74$)
immersed in a magnetized accretion disk. About $4000M \sim 60(M_{\rm

becomes strongly magnetized, and a collimated, mildly relativistic outflow ---
an incipient jet --- is launched. The lifetime of the accretion disk, which
likely equals the lifetime of the jet, is $\Delta t \sim 0.1 (M_{\rm

determined by interactions internal to a thermalized dark sector, with no
direct involvement of the Standard Model (SM). We point out that these theories
raise an immediate cosmological question: how was the dark sector initially
populated in the early universe? Motivated in part by the difficulty of
accommodating large amounts of entropy carried in dark radiation with cosmic
microwave background measurements of the effective number of relativistic
species at recombination, $N_{\mathrm{eff}}$, we aim to establish which
admissible cosmological histories can populate a thermal dark sector that never
reaches thermal equilibrium with the SM. The minimal cosmological origin for
such a dark sector is asymmetric reheating, when the same mechanism that
populates the SM in the early universe also populates the dark sector at a
lower temperature. Here we demonstrate that the resulting inevitable
inflaton-mediated scattering between the dark sector and the SM can wash out a
would-be temperature asymmetry, and establish the regions of parameter space
where temperature asymmetries can be generated in minimal reheating scenarios.
Thus obtaining a temperature asymmetry of a given size either restricts
possible inflaton masses and couplings or necessitates a non-minimal cosmology
for one or both sectors. As a side benefit, we develop techniques for
evaluating collision terms in the relativistic Boltzmann equation when the full
dependence on Bose-Einstein or Fermi-Dirac phase space distributions must be
retained, and present several new results on relativistic thermal averages in
an appendix.

models of galaxy spectral energy distributions to extract constraints on galaxy
physical parameters (such as stellar mass and star formation rate) as well as

this intriguing source in December 2014 with the aim of studying its
high-energy emission, leveraging the broad band covered by the new NuSTAR and
the archival XMM-Newton data. Several measurements are in agreement with the
super-Eddington scenario for PG1247+267: the soft power law
($\Gamma=2.3\pm0.1$); the weak ionized Fe emission line and a hint of the
presence of outflowing ionized gas surrounding the SMBH. The presence of an
extreme reflection component is instead at odds with the high accretion rate
proposed for this quasar. This can be explained with three different scenarios;
all of them are in good agreement with the existing data, but imply very
different conclusions: i) a variable primary power law observed in a low state,
superimposed on a reflection component echoing a past, higher flux state; ii) a
power law continuum obscured by an ionized, Compton thick, partial covering
absorber; and iii) a relativistic disk reflector in a lamp-post geometry, with
low coronal height and high BH spin. The first model is able to explain the
high reflection component in terms of variability. The second does not require
any reflection to reproduce the hard emission, while a rather low high-energy
cutoff of $\sim100$ keV is detected for the first time in such a high redshift
source. The third model require a face-on geometry, which may affect the SMBH

the mass-to-light (M/L) ratio of the stellar component through a previously

baryonic mass model with variable axis ratios together with one of the three DM
models to provide the theoretical rotational velocity curves, and we compared
them with the dataset. In a second attempt, we addressed the question whether
the dark component could be replaced by a pure baryonic model with fitted M/L
ratios. We employed the Akaike information criterion (AIC) to establish the
performance of the best-fit models. For 7 galaxies, neither model fits the

mutations in a large number of patients from the same cancer type. One of the
main goals in analyzing these mutations is the identification of mutations
associated with clinical parameters, such as survival time. This goal is
hindered by the genetic heterogeneity of mutations in cancer, due to the fact
that genes and mutations act in the context of pathways. To identify mutations
associated with survival time it is therefore crucial to study mutations in the
context of interaction networks.
  In this work we study the problem of identifying subnetworks of a large
gene-gene interaction network that have mutations associated with survival. We
formally define the associated computational problem by using a score for
subnetworks based on the test statistic of the log-rank test, a widely used
statistical test for comparing the survival of two populations. We show that
the computational problem is NP-hard and we propose a novel algorithm, called
Network of Mutations Associated with Survival (NoMAS), to solve it. NoMAS is
based on the color-coding technique, that has been previously used in other
applications to find the highest scoring subnetwork with high probability when
the subnetwork score is additive. In our case the score is not additive;
nonetheless, we prove that under a reasonable model for mutations in cancer
NoMAS does identify the optimal solution with high probability. We test NoMAS
on simulated and cancer data, comparing it to approaches based on single gene
tests and to various greedy approaches. We show that our method does indeed
find the optimal solution and performs better than the other approaches.
Moreover, on two cancer datasets our method identifies subnetworks with
significant association to survival when none of the genes has significant
association with survival when considered in isolation.

deterministic setting. The derivation of the outer bounds on the secrecy
capacity region involves careful selection of the side information to be
provided to the receivers and using the secrecy constraints at the receivers in
a judicious manner. To this end, a novel partitioning of the encoded messages
and outputs is proposed for the deterministic model based on the strength of
interference and signal. The obtained outer bounds are shown to be tight using
the achievable scheme derived by the authors in a previous work. Using the
insight obtained from the deterministic model, outer bounds on the secrecy
capacity region of the 2-user Gaussian Z-IC are obtained. The equivalence
between the outer bounds for both the models is also established. It is also
shown that secrecy constraint at the receiver does not hurt the capacity region
of the 2-user Z-IC for the deterministic model in the weak/moderate
interference regime. On the other hand, the outer bounds developed for the
Gaussian case shows that secrecy constraint at the receiver can reduce the
capacity region for the weak/moderate interference regime. The study of the
relative performance of these bounds reveals insight into the fundamental
limits of the 2-user Z-IC with limited rate transmitter cooperation.

However we argue that the GR vacuum is absolutely stable and AdS cannot be
reached neither via classical evolution nor via quantum tunnelling. Our results
show that a Starobinsky-like model is the only possible realisation of $f(R)$
theory with an extremely flat area in the Einstein frame potential.

compare our data to a variety of models for the emission physics. The Main
Pulse and the Low-Frequency Interpulse come from regions somewhere in the
high-altitude emission zones (caustics) that also produce pulsed X-ray and
gamma-ray emission. Although no emission model can fully explain these two
components, the most likely models suggest they arise from a combination of
beam-driven instabilities, coherent charge bunching and strong electromagnetic
turbulence. Because the radio power fluctuates on a wide range of timescales,
we know the emission zones are patchy and dynamic. It is tempting to invoke
unsteady pair creation in high-altitude gaps as source of the variability, but
current pair cascade models cannot explain the densities required by any of the
likely models. It is harder to account for the mysterious High-Frequency
Interpulse. We understand neither its origin within the magnetosphere nor the
striking emission bands in its dynamic spectrum. The most promising models are
based on analogies with solar zebra bands, but they require unusual plasma
structures which are not part of our standard picture of the magnetosphere. We
argue that radio observations can reveal much about the upper magnetosphere,
but work is required before the models can address all of the data.

DCS with jointly sparse signals has applications in multi-sensor acoustic
sensing, magnetic resonance imaging with multiple coils, remote sensing, and
array signal processing. Multi-measurement vector (MMV) problems consider the
estimation of jointly sparse signals under the DCS framework. Two related MMV
settings are studied. In the first setting, each signal vector is measured by a
different independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) measurement matrix,
while in the second setting, all signal vectors are measured by the same i.i.d.
matrix. Replica analysis is performed for these two MMV settings, and the
minimum mean squared error (MMSE), which turns out to be identical for both
settings, is obtained as a function of the noise variance and number of
measurements. To showcase the application of MMV models, the MMSE's of complex
CS problems with both real and complex measurement matrices are also analyzed.
Multiple performance regions for MMV are identified where the MMSE behaves
differently as a function of the noise variance and the number of measurements.
  Belief propagation (BP) is a CS signal estimation framework that often
achieves the MMSE asymptotically. A phase transition for BP is identified. This
phase transition, verified by numerical results, separates the regions where BP
achieves the MMSE and where it is suboptimal. Numerical results also illustrate
that more signal vectors in the jointly sparse signal ensemble lead to a better
phase transition.

the possibility to process also non-numeric data by means of an embedding

outcoming partition of vertices defines the classifier. The final partition is
derived by exploiting a criterion based on mutual information minimization.
Here, we compute the mutual information by using a convenient formulation
provided in terms of the $\alpha$-Jensen difference. Once training is
completed, in order to associate a confidence level with the classifier
decision, a graph-based fuzzy model is constructed. The fuzzification process
is based only on topological information of the vertices of the entropic

data characterized by complex geometric structures. We provide experiments on
well-known benchmarks containing both feature vectors and labeled graphs. In
addition, we apply the method to the protein solubility recognition problem by
considering several representations for the input samples. Experimental results
demonstrate the effectiveness and versatility of the proposed method with

neutrino-nucleus interactions at different neutrino energies or different
distances from the source. Knowledge of the neutrino energy spectrum and
neutrino-detector interactions are crucial for these experiments. Short range
nucleon-nucleon correlations in nuclei (SRC) affect properties of nuclei. The
ArgoNeut liquid Argon Time Projection Chamber (lArTPC) observed neutrino-argon
scattering events with two protons back-to-back in the final state (""hammer""
events) which they associated with SRC pairs. The MicroBoone lArTPC will
measure far more of these events.
  We simulate hammer events using two simple models. We use the well-known
electron-nucleon cross section to calculate e-argon interactions where the e-
scatters from a proton, ejecting a pi+, and the pi+ is then absorbed on a
moving deuteron-like $np$ pair. We also use a model where the electron excites
a nucleon to a Delta, which then deexcites by interacting with a second
nucleon.
  The pion production model results in two protons very similar to those of the
hammer events. These distributions are insensitive to the momentum of the $np$
pair that absorbed the $\pi$. The incident neutrino energy can be reconstructed
from just the outgoing lepton. The Delta process results in two protons that
are less similar to the observed events.
  ArgoNeut hammer events can be described by a simple pion production and
reabsorption model. These hammer events in MicroBooNE can be used to determine
the incident neutrino energy but not to learn about SRC. We suggest that this
reaction channel could be used for neutrino oscillation experiments to
complement other channels with higher statistics but different systematic
uncertainties.

intratumor heterogeneity, much attention has focused on the challenges of
accurately profiling heterogeneity in individual patients. Experimental
technologies for directly profiling genomes of single cells are rapidly
improving, but they are still impractical for large-scale sampling. Bulk
genomic assays remain the standard for population-scale studies, but conflate
the influences of mixtures of genetically distinct tumor, stromal, and
infiltrating immune cells. Many computational approaches have been developed to
deconvolute these mixed samples and reconstruct the genomics of genetically
homogeneous clonal subpopulations. All such methods, however, are limited to
reconstructing only coarse approximations to a few major subpopulations. In
prior work, we showed that one can improve deconvolution of genomic data by
leveraging substructure in cellular mixtures through a strategy called
simplicial complex inference. This strategy, however, is also limited by the
difficulty of inferring mixture structure from sparse, noisy assays. Results:
We improve on past work by introducing enhancements to automate learning of
substructured genomic mixtures, with specific emphasis on genome-wide copy
number variation (CNV) data. We introduce methods for dimensionality estimation
to better decompose mixture model substructure; fuzzy clustering to better
identify substructure in sparse, noisy data; and automated model inference
methods for other key model parameters. We show that these improvements lead to
more accurate inference of cell populations and mixture proportions in
simulated scenarios. We further demonstrate their effectiveness in identifying
mixture substructure in real tumor CNV data. Availability: Source code is

(SAR) satellite images is proposed. It makes use of the textural features of
the different regions in the image for segmentation. The method consists in a
multiscale analysis of the images, which allows us to study the images
regularity both, locally and globally. As results of the analysis, coarse
multifractal spectra of studied images and a group of images that associates
each position (pixel) with its corresponding value of local regularity (or
singularity) spectrum are obtained. Thresholds are then applied to the
multifractal spectra of the images for the classification. These thresholds are
selected after studying the characteristics of the spectra under the assumption
that water bodies have larger local regularity than other soil types.
Classifications obtained by the multifractal method are compared quantitatively
with those obtained by neural networks trained to classify the pixels of the
images in covered against uncovered by water. In optical images, the
classifications are also compared with those derived using the so-called

validated in experiments and Discrete Element Method (DEM) simulations. The
form instructs how to scale size, mass, and driving parameters in order to
relate dynamic behaviors of different locomotors in the same granular media.
The scaling can be derived by assuming intrusion forces arise from Resistive
Force Theory (RFT) or equivalently by assuming the granular material behaves as
a continuum obeying a frictional yield criterion. The scalings are
experimentally confirmed using pairs of wheels of various shapes and sizes
under many driving conditions in a common sand bed. We discuss why the two
models provide such a robust set of scaling laws even though they neglect a
number of the complexities of granular rheology. Motivated by potential
extra-planetary applications, the dimensionless form also implies a way to
predict wheel performance in one ambient gravity based on tests in a different
ambient gravity. We confirm this using DEM simulations, which show that scaling
relations are satisfied over an array of driving modes even when gravity
differs between scaled tests.

are independent. By contrast, the new field of adaptive data analysis hopes to
understand and provide algorithms and accuracy guarantees for research as it is
commonly performed in practice, as an iterative process of interacting
repeatedly with the same data set, such as repeated tests against a holdout
set. Previous work has defined a model with a rather strong lower bound on
sample complexity in terms of the number of queries, $n\sim\sqrt q$, arguing
that adaptive data analysis is much harder than static data analysis, where
$n\sim\log q$ is possible. Instead, we argue that those strong lower bounds
point to a limitation of the previous model in that it must consider wildly
asymmetric scenarios which do not hold in typical applications.
  To better understand other difficulties of adaptivity, we propose a new
Bayesian version of the problem that mandates symmetry. Since the other lower
bound techniques are ruled out, we can more effectively see difficulties that
might otherwise be overshadowed. As a first contribution to this model, we
produce a new problem using error-correcting codes on which a large family of
methods, including all previously proposed algorithms, require roughly
$n\sim\sqrt[4]q$. These early results illustrate new difficulties in adaptive
data analysis regarding slightly correlated queries on problems with
concentrated uncertainty.

combination of the application precondition of super-directivity in HF band and
circular topology of IWSNs, a super-directivity synthesis method is presented
for designing super-directivity array. In this method, the dominance of
external noise is ensured by constraining the Ratio of External to Internal
Noise (REIN) of the array, and the desired side lobe level is achieved by
implementing linear constraint. By using this method, the highest directivity
will be achieved in certain conditions. Using the designed super directive
circular array as sub-arrays, the compact receive antenna array is constructed,
the purpose of miniaturization is achieved. Simulation verifies that the
proposed method is correct and effective, the validity of the proposed method

researchers to sequence complex microbial communities directly from
environment. Since assembly typically produces only genome fragments, also
known as contigs, instead of entire genome, it is crucial to group them into
operational taxonomic units (OTUs) for further taxonomic profiling and
down-streaming functional analysis. OTU clustering is also referred to as
binning. We present COCACOLA, a general framework automatically bin contigs
into OTUs based upon sequence composition and coverage across multiple samples.
  The effectiveness of COCACOLA is demonstrated in both simulated and real
datasets in comparison to state-of-art binning approaches such as CONCOCT,
GroopM, MaxBin and MetaBAT. The superior performance of COCACOLA relies on two
aspects. One is employing $L_{1}$ distance instead of Euclidean distance for
better taxonomic identification during initialization. More importantly,
COCACOLA takes advantage of both hard clustering and soft clustering by
sparsity regularization.
  In addition, the COCACOLA framework seamlessly embraces customized knowledge
to facilitate binning accuracy. In our study, we have investigated two types of
additional knowledge, the co-alignment to reference genomes and linkage of
contigs provided by paired-end reads, as well as the ensemble of both. We find
that both co-alignment and linkage information further improve binning in the
majority of cases. COCACOLA is scalable and faster than CONCOCT ,GroopM, MaxBin
and MetaBAT.

in harsh communication environment. However, most of the existing relaying
schemes are based on relays with fixed locations, or \emph{static relaying}. In
this paper, we consider a novel \emph{mobile relaying} technique, where the
relay nodes are assumed to be capable of moving at high speed. Compared to
static relaying, mobile relaying offers a new degree of freedom for performance
enhancement via careful relay trajectory design. We study the throughput
maximization problem in mobile relaying systems by optimizing the source/relay
transmit power along with the relay trajectory, subject to practical mobility
constraints (on the relay speed and initial/final relay locations), as well as
the \emph{information-causality constraint} at the relay owing to its
decode-store-and-forward (DSF) strategy. It is shown that for fixed relay
trajectory, the throughput-optimal source/relay power allocations over time
follow a ""staircase"" water filling (WF) structure, with \emph{non-increasing}
and \emph{non-decreasing} water levels at the source and relay, respectively.
On the other hand, with given power allocations, the throughput can be further
improved by optimizing the relay trajectory via successive convex optimization.
An iterative algorithm is thus proposed to optimize the power allocations and
relay trajectory alternately. Furthermore, for the special case with free
initial and final relay locations, the jointly optimal power allocation and
relay trajectory are derived. Numerical results show that by optimizing the
trajectory of the relay and power allocations adaptive to its induced channel
variation, mobile relaying is able to achieve significant throughput gains over
the conventional static relaying.

devices embedded in the environment and support their device-to-device (D2D)

challenge of designing IoT since batteries increase the devices' form factors
and their recharging/replacement is difficult. To tackle this challenge, we
propose a novel network architecture that integrates wireless power transfer
and backscatter communication, called wirelessly powered backscatter
communication (WP-BC) networks. In this architecture, power beacons (PBs) are
deployed for wirelessly powering devices; their ad-hoc communication relies on
backscattering and modulating incident continuous waves from PBs, which
consumes orders-of-magnitude less power than traditional radios. Thereby, the
dense deployment of low-complexity PBs with high transmission power can power a
large-scale IoT. In this paper, a WP-BC network is modeled as a random Poisson
cluster process in the horizontal plane where PBs are Poisson distributed and
active ad-hoc pairs of backscatter communication nodes with fixed separation
distances form random clusters centered at PBs. Furthermore, by harvesting
energy from and backscattering radio frequency (RF) waves transmitted by PBs,
the transmission power of each node depends on the distance from the associated
PB. Applying stochastic geometry, the network coverage probability and
transmission capacity are derived and optimized as functions of the backscatter
duty cycle and reflection coefficient as well as the PB density. The effects of
the parameters on network performance are characterized.

computation to clouds located at the edges of cellular networks. Thereby, MECO
is envisioned as a promising technique for prolonging the battery lives and
enhancing the computation capacities of mobiles. In this paper, we consider
resource allocation in a MECO system comprising multiple users that time share
a single edge cloud and have different computation loads. The optimal resource
allocation is formulated as a convex optimization problem for minimizing the
weighted sum mobile energy consumption under constraint on computation latency
and for both the cases of infinite and finite edge cloud computation
capacities. The optimal policy is proved to have a threshold-based structure
with respect to a derived offloading priority function, which yields priorities
for users according to their channel gains and local computing energy
consumption. As a result, users with priorities above and below a given
threshold perform complete and minimum offloading, respectively. Computing the
threshold requires iterative computation. To reduce the complexity, a
sub-optimal resource-allocation algorithm is proposed and shown by simulation
to have close-to-optimal performance.

To alleviate the aforementioned limitations, a rolling PID control approach is
proposed in this study, in which, at each rolling period, the PID controller
parameters are updated using observable data, which can be classified to
data-driven control method. The effectiveness of the proposed approach has been
validated by experiments.

  Shared Memory Systems","9 pages, 7 figures, submitted to SuperComputing 2016",,,,"cs.MS","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Given a sparse matrix $A$, the selected inversion algorithm is an efficient
method for computing certain selected elements of $A^{-1}$. These selected
elements correspond to all or some nonzero elements of the LU factors of $A$.
In many ways, the type of matrix updates performed in the selected inversion
algorithm is similar to that performed in the LU factorization, although the
sequence of operation is different. In the context of LU factorization, it is
known that the left-looking and right-looking algorithms exhibit different
memory access and data communication patterns, and hence different behavior on
shared memory and distributed memory parallel machines. Corresponding to
right-looking and left-looking LU factorization, selected inversion algorithm
can be organized as a left-looking and a right-looking algorithm. The parallel
right-looking version of the algorithm has been developed in [1]. The sequence
of operations performed in this version of the selected inversion algorithm is
similar to those performed in a left-looking LU factorization algorithm. In
this paper, we describe the left-looking variant of the selected inversion
algorithm, and based on task parallel method, present an efficient
implementation of the algorithm for shared memory machines. We demonstrate that
with the task scheduling features provided by OpenMP 4.0, the left-looking
selected inversion algorithm can scale well both on the Intel Haswell multicore
architecture and on the Intel Knights Corner (KNC) manycore architecture.
Compared to the right-looking selected inversion algorithm, the left-looking
formulation facilitates pipelining of work along different branches of the
elimination tree, and can be a promising candidate for future development of
massively parallel selected inversion algorithms on heterogeneous architecture.

gravitation wave event GW150914 from two merging black holes; however the
nature of the black holes are still not clear.
  Aims: We study whether electromagnetic radiation can be detected from merging
stellar mass black binaries like GW150914.
  Methods: We briefly investigate the possible growth and merging processes of
the two stellar mass black holes in the merging event of GW150914 detected by
aLIGO, as clocked by a distant external observer.
  Our main results are: (1) The description of the black hole growth using
stationary metric of a pre-existing black hole predicts strong electromagnetic
radiation from merging black holes, which is inconsistent with GW150914; (2)
Only gravitational wave radiation can be produced in the coalescence of two
black holes such as that in the GW150914 event, if the black hole growth is
described using time-dependent metric considering the influence of the
in-falling matter onto a pre-existing black hole, as clocked by a distant
external observer.
  Conclusions: Future high sensitivity detections of gravitational waves from
merging black holes might be used to probe matter distribution and space-time
geometry in the vicinity of the horizon. Perhaps the GW150914-like events can
be identified with traditional astronomy observations only if the black holes
are embedded in extremely dense medium before their final merge, when very
strong electromagnetic radiation is produced and can escape from the system.

of such features as the granules, mesogranules, supergranules and giant cells -
has not yet been properly understood. Here, the possible role of one physical
factor - variations in the thermal diffusivity - in the formation of a
multiscale convection structure is investigated. Thermal convection in a plane
horizontal fluid layer is numerically simulated. The temperature dependence of
thermal diffusivity is chosen so as to produce a sharp kink in the static
temperature profile near the upper layer boundary. As a result, the magnitude
of the (negative) static temperature gradient dTs/dz, being small over the most
part of the layer thickness, reaches large values in a thin boundary sublayer.
To identify the structures on different scales, we apply a smoothing procedure,
computational-homology techniques and spectral processing to the temperature
field. The flow is found to be a superposition of three cellular structures
with three different characteristic scales. The largest (first-scale)
convection cells, with central upflows, fill the whole layer thickness; most of
these cells are divided by bridges, or isthmuses, into a few smaller
(second-scale) ones, which are localised in the upper portion of the layer;
finally, there are numerous tiny (third-scale) features that dot the horizontal
sections of the layer located near its upper boundary and exhibit a tendency of
gathering in the intercellular lanes of the first-scale cells. The third-scale
cellular structures are advected by the first-scale and second-scale convective
flows. The spatial spectrum of the flow does not directly indicate the presence
of the second-scale and third-scale structures; however, they can be selected
by using our processing techniques. On the whole, the simulated flow pattern
qualitatively resembles that observed on the Sun.

matching procedure, that led to a finite energy spectrum. In seeking the
condition governing the time evolution of the tunnelling process, the Euler
formula provided the crucial ingredient for time quantization, which
discretised the continuous time in the oscillating barrier potential and energy
harmonic equations. As a result, a finite system of inelastic scattering
channels was created. When an electron entered the elastic channel, it was
scattered, instantaneously, into finite neighbouring energy-level scattering
channels, by absorption (emission) of photon energy from (to) the oscillating
field, during the transit period across the dynamic barrier. The absorption and
emission times of barrier traversal, T_+ and T_-, respectively, were derived

frequently links are created or destroyed when doing link prediction. In this
paper, we introduce a new supervised link prediction framework, RPM (Rate
Prediction Model). In addition to network similarity measures, RPM uses the
predicted rate of link modifications, modeled using time series data; it is
implemented in Spark-ML and trained with the original link distribution, rather

experiments show that RPM, which leverages predicted rates, outperforms the use
of network similarity measures, either individually or within a time series.

generalization of the constant frequency. The instantaneous frequency (IF) is
the time derivative of the instantaneous phase and it is well-defined only when
this derivative is positive. If this derivative is negative, the IF creates
problem because it does not provide any physical significance. This study
proposes a mathematical solution and eliminate this problem by redefining the
IF such that it is valid for all monocomponent and multicomponent signals which
can be nonlinear and nonstationary in nature. This is achieved by using the
property of the multivalued inverse tangent function. The efforts and
understanding of all the methods based on the IF would improve significantly by
using this proposed definition of the IF. We also demonstrate that the
decomposition of a signal, using zero-phase filtering based on the well
established Fourier and filter theory, into a set of desired frequency bands
with proposed IF produces accurate time-frequency-energy (TFE) distribution
that reveals true nature of signal. Simulation results demonstrate the efficacy
of the proposed IF that makes zero-phase filter based decomposition most
powerful, for the TFE analysis of a signal, as compared to other existing
methods in the literature.
