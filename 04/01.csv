simulations in mission-critical applications, the quantification of model-form
uncertainty in RANS models has attracted attention in the turbulence modeling
community. Recently, a physics-based, nonparametric approach for quantifying
model-form uncertainty in RANS simulations has been proposed, where Reynolds
stresses are projected to physically meaningful dimensions and perturbations
are introduced only in the physically realizable limits. However, a challenge
associated with this approach is to assess the amount of information introduced
in the prior distribution and to avoid imposing unwarranted constraints. In
this work we propose a random matrix approach for quantifying model-form
uncertainties in RANS simulations with the realizability of the Reynolds stress
guaranteed. Furthermore, the maximum entropy principle is used to identify the
probability distribution that satisfies the constraints from available
information but without introducing artificial constraints. We demonstrate that
the proposed approach is able to ensure the realizability of the Reynolds
stress, albeit in a different manner from the physics-based approach. Monte
Carlo sampling of the obtained probability distribution is achieved by using
polynomial chaos expansion to map independent Gaussian random fields to the
Reynolds stress random field with the marginal distributions and correlation
structures as specified. Numerical simulations on a typical flow with
separation have shown physically reasonable results, which verifies the
proposed approach. Therefore, the proposed method is a promising alternative to
the physics-based approach for model-form uncertainty quantification of RANS
simulations. The method explored in this work is general and can be extended to
other complex physical systems in applied mechanics and engineering.

originally developed within the EUDET project. The beam telescopes are equipped
with six sensor planes using MIMOSA26 monolithic active pixel devices. A
programmable Trigger Logic Unit provides trigger logic and time stamp
information on particle passage. Both data acquisition framework and offline
reconstruction software packages are available. User devices are easily
integrable into the data acquisition framework via predefined interfaces.
  The biased residual distribution is studied as a function of the beam energy,
plane spacing and sensor threshold. Its standard deviation at the two centre
pixel planes using all six planes for tracking in a 6\,GeV
electron/positron-beam is measured to be
$(2.88\,\pm\,0.08)\,\upmu\meter$.Iterative track fits using the formalism of
General Broken Lines are performed to estimate the intrinsic resolution of the
individual pixel planes. The mean intrinsic resolution over the six sensors
used is found to be $(3.24\,\pm\,0.09)\,\upmu\meter$.With a 5\,GeV
electron/positron beam, the track resolution halfway between the two inner
pixel planes using an equidistant plane spacing of 20\,mm is estimated to
$(1.83\,\pm\,0.03)\,\upmu\meter$ assuming the measured intrinsic resolution.
Towards lower beam energies the track resolution deteriorates due to increasing
multiple scattering. Threshold studies show an optimal working point of the
MIMOSA26 sensors at a sensor threshold of between five and six times their RMS
noise. Measurements at different plane spacings are used to calibrate the
amount of multiple scattering in the material traversed and allow for
corrections to the predicted angular scattering for electron beams.

was successfully answered recently by the authors for a spatially flat FRW
model in the canonical approach. In this manuscript, we obtain a covariant
generalization of this result. Our analysis is based on expressing loop quantum
cosmology in the spin foam paradigm and using histories defined via volume
transitions to compute the amplitudes of transitions obtained using a vertex
expansion. We show that the probability for bounce turns out to be unity.

cavity can reduce the damping of a mechanical resonator, leading to parametric
instability accompanied by self-sustained oscillations. Fundamentally, the
driving breaks the continuous time-translation symmetry and replaces it with
the symmetry with respect to time translation by the driving period. This
discrete symmetry should be reflected in the character of the oscillations.
Here, we perform experimental and theoretical study of new aspects of the
backaction and the discrete time-translation symmetry using a micromechanical
resonator designed to have two nonlinearly coupled vibrational modes with
strongly differing frequencies and decay rates. We find that self-sustained
oscillations are induced not only in the low frequency mode as measured in
previous experiments, but also in the high frequency mode. The vibration
frequencies and amplitudes are determined by the system nonlinearity, which
also leads to bistability and hysteresis. A remarkable consequence of the
discrete time-translation symmetry is revealed by studying the vibration
phases. We find that the phase fluctuations of the two modes are nearly
perfectly anti-correlated. At the same time, in each mode the phase undergoes
anomalous diffusion, where the time dependence of the phase variance follows a
superlinear rather than the standard linear power law. Our analysis shows that
the exponent of the power law is determined by the exponent of the 1/f-type
intrinsic frequency noise of the resonator. We demonstrate the possibility of
compensating for these fluctuations using a feedback scheme to generate stable
oscillations that could prove useful in frequency standards and resonant
detection.

complex parallel software stacks whose aim is to tackle the challenges of data
deluge. A drawback of a such multi-layered hierarchical deployment is the
inability to maintain and delegate vital semantic information between layers in
the stack. Software abstractions increase the semantic distance between an
application and its generated code. However, parallel software frameworks
contain inherent semantic information that general purpose compilers are not
designed to exploit.
  This paper presents a case study demonstrating how the specific semantic
information of the MapReduce paradigm can be exploited on multicore
architectures. MR4J has been implemented in Java and evaluated against
hand-optimized C and C++ equivalents. The initial observed results led to the
design of a semantically aware optimizer that runs automatically without
requiring modification to application code.
  The optimizer is able to speedup the execution time of MR4J by up to 2.0x.
The introduced optimization not only improves the performance of the generated
code, during the map phase, but also reduces the pressure on the garbage
collector. This demonstrates how semantic information can be harnessed without
sacrificing sound software engineering practices when using parallel software
frameworks.

to deviate from simple Fickian diffusion. One explanation offered for this
behavior is that molecular crowding renders diffusion anomalous, where the
mean-squared displacement of the particles scales as $\langle r^2 \rangle
\propto t^{\alpha}$ with $\alpha < 1$. Unfortunately, methods such as
fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (FCS) or fluorescence recovery after
photobleaching (FRAP) probe diffusion only over a narrow range of lengthscales
and cannot directly test the dependence of the mean-squared displacement (MSD)
on time. Here we show that variable-lengthscale FCS (VLS-FCS), where the volume
of observation is varied over several orders of magnitude, combined with a
numerical inversion procedure of the correlation data, allows retrieving the
MSD for up to five decades in time, bridging the gap between diffusion
experiments performed at different lengthscales. In addition, we show that
VLS-FCS provides a way to assess whether the propagator associated with the
diffusion is Gaussian or non-Gaussian. We used VLS-FCS to investigate two
systems where anomalous diffusion had been previously reported. In the case of
dense cross-linked agarose gels, the measured MSD confirmed that the diffusion
of small beads was anomalous at short lengthscales, with a cross-over to simple
diffusion around $\approx 1~\mu$m, consistent with a caged diffusion process.
On the other hand, for solutions crowded with marginally entangled dextran
molecules, we uncovered an apparent discrepancy between the MSD, found to be
linear, and the propagators at short lengthscales, found to be non-Gaussian.
These contradicting features call to mind the ""anomalous, yet Brownian""
diffusion observed in several biological systems, and the recently proposed
""diffusing diffusivity"" model.

observables are derived that promise to be of use in detecting a rotating
traversable wormhole indirectly, if it does exist. We also deduce the exact
Lense-Thirring (LT) precession frequency of a test gyroscope moving toward a
rotating traversable Teo wormhole. The precession frequency diverges on the
ergoregion, a behavior intimately related to and governed by the geometry of
the ergoregion, analogous to the situation in a Kerr spacetime. Interestingly,
it turns out that here the LT precession is inversely proportional to the
angular momentum ($a$) of the wormhole along the pole and around it in the
strong gravity regime, a behavior contrasting with its direct variation with
$a$ in the case of other compact objects. In fact, divergence of LT precession
inside the ergoregion can also be avoided if the gyro moves with a non-zero
angular velocity in a certain range. As a result, the spin precession frequency
of the gyro can be made finite throughout its whole path, even very close to
the throat, during its travel to the wormhole. Furthermore, it is evident from
our formulation that this spin precession not only arises due to curvature or
rotation of the spacetime but also due to the non-zero angular velocity of the
spin when it does not move along a geodesic in the strong gravity regime. If in
the future, interstellar travel indeed becomes possible through a wormhole or
at least in its vicinity, our results would prove useful in determining the
behavior of a test gyroscope which is known to serve as a fundamental
navigation device.

variety}$ if $H$ acts on it transitively, and satisfies a few other properties,
such as $H$ being semisimple. Some examples of homogeneous varieties are
quadric hypersurfaces, rational normal curves, and Veronese and Segre

by $H$, and we will call the result space of \textit{complete homogeneous

formula for the volume of divisors that depends only on the dimension of

some tools in invariant theory, combinatorics and spline approximation to
calculate such invariants, and carry out the entire calculations for the case

explicit values for the volume function in the case of $X$ being a twisted

  following comments by reviewers",,,,"cs.IT math.IT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Motivated by recent developments in wireless power transfer, we study
communication with a remotely powered transmitter. We propose an
information-theoretic model where a charger can dynamically decide on how much
power to transfer to the transmitter based on its side information regarding
the communication, while the transmitter needs to dynamically adapt its coding
strategy to its instantaneous energy state, which in turn depends on the
actions previously taken by the charger. We characterize the capacity as an
$n$-letter mutual information rate under various levels of side information
available at the charger. When the charger is finely tunable to different
energy levels, referred to as a ""precision charger"", we show that these
expressions reduce to single-letter form and there is a simple and intuitive
joint charging and coding scheme achieving capacity. The precision charger
scenario is motivated by the observation that in practice the transferred
energy can be controlled by simply changing the amplitude of the beamformed
signal. When the charger does not have sufficient precision, for example when
it is restricted to use a few discrete energy levels, we show that the
computation of the $n$-letter capacity can be cast as a Markov decision process
if the channel is noiseless. This allows us to numerically compute the capacity
for specific cases and obtain insights on the corresponding optimal policy, or
even to obtain closed form analytical solutions by solving the corresponding
Bellman equations, as we demonstrate through examples. Our findings provide
some surprising insights on how side information at the charger can be used to
increase the overall capacity of the system.

their heads towards the other participants rather than facing the cameras and
the microphones. Multiple-person visual tracking is combined with multiple
speech-source localization in order to tackle the speech-to-person association

following grounds: binaural spectral features are first extracted from a
microphone pair, then a supervised audio-visual alignment technique maps these
features onto an image, and finally a semi-supervised clustering method assigns
binaural spectral features to visible persons. The main advantage of this
method over previous work is that it processes in a principled way speech
signals uttered simultaneously by multiple persons. The diarization itself is
cast into a latent-variable temporal graphical model that infers speaker
identities and speech turns, based on the output of an audio-visual association
process, executed at each time slice, and on the dynamics of the diarization
variable itself. The proposed formulation yields an efficient exact inference
procedure. A novel dataset, that contains audio-visual training data as well as

changes in the underlying generative processes driving the time series. Despite
having received significant attention, one important unexplored aspect is how
to efficiently utilize additional correlated information to improve the
detection and the understanding of changepoints. We propose hierarchical
quickest change detection (HQCD), a framework that formalizes the process of
incorporating additional correlated sources for early changepoint detection.
The core ideas behind HQCD are rooted in the theory of quickest detection and
HQCD can be regarded as its novel generalization to a hierarchical setting. The
sources are classified into targets and surrogates, and HQCD leverages this
structure to systematically assimilate observed data to update changepoint
statistics across layers. The decision on actual changepoints are provided by
minimizing the delay while still maintaining reliability bounds. In addition,
HQCD also uncovers interesting relations between changes at targets from
changes across surrogates. We validate HQCD for reliability and performance
against several state-of-the-art methods for both synthetic dataset (known
changepoints) and several real-life examples (unknown changepoints). Our
experiments indicate that we gain significant robustness without loss of
detection delay through HQCD. Our real-life experiments also showcase the
usefulness of the hierarchical setting by connecting the surrogate sources

correlates broadly with quiescence, we find that quiescence is primarily a
function of black hole mass, where galaxies quench when heating from their
active galactic nuclei becomes sufficient to offset the redshift-dependent
cooling rate. In this model, the emergence of a prominent quiescent population
is the main process that flattens the stellar mass-halo mass relation at mass
scales at or above that of the Milky Way.

conditions of the calculations such as the initial half-mass radius of the
clusters, initial binary populations for massive stars and initial mass
segregation. We find that the initial density is the most influential parameter
for the ejection fraction of the massive systems. The clusters with an initial
half-mass radius of 0.1 (0.3) pc can eject up to 50% (30%) of their O-star
systems on average. Most of the models show that the average ejection fraction
decreases with decreasing stellar mass. For clusters efficient at ejecting O
stars, the mass function of the ejected stars is top-heavy compared to the
given initial mass function (IMF), while the mass function of stars that remain
in the cluster becomes slightly steeper (top-light) than the IMF. The top-light
mass functions of stars in 3 Myr old clusters in our N-body models agree well
with the mean mass function of young intermediate-mass clusters in M31, as
reported previously. We show that the multiplicity fraction of the ejected

can be dynamically ejected, and that high-order multiples become common

top quark (stops) play the crucial role in addressing the naturalness problem.
For direct pair-production of stops with each stop decaying into a top quark
plus the lightest neutralino, the standard stop searches have difficulty
finding the stop for a compressed spectrum where the mass difference between
the stop and the lightest neutralino is close to the top quark mass, because
the events look too similar to the large $t\bar{t}$ background. With an
additional hard ISR jet, the two neutralinos from the stop decays are boosted
in the opposite direction and they can give rise to some missing transverse
energy. This may be used to distinguish the stop decays from the backgrounds.
In this paper we study the semileptonic decay of such signal events for the
compressed mass spectrum. Although the neutrino from the $W$ decay also
produces some missing transverse energy, its momentum can be reconstructed from
the kinematic assumptions and mass-shell conditions. It can then be subtracted
from the total missing transverse momentum to obtain the neutralino
contribution. Because it suffers from less backgrounds, we show that the
semileptonic decay channel has a better discovery reach than the fully hadronic
decay channel along the compressed line $m_{\tilde{t}} -
m_{\tilde{\chi}}\approx m_t$. With 300 $\text{fb}^{-1}$, the 13 TeV LHC can

(a planet or star) in an eccentric and/or mutually inclined orbit. In this
model the warm Jupiters migrate periodically, in the high-eccentricity phase of
the oscillation when the pericenter distance is small, but are typically

presence of a dense and structured circumstellar medium, probably produced
through numerous pre-supernova mass-loss events. In addition, we find evidence
for high-velocity ejecta, with a fraction of gas expelled at more than
20000\kms. The spectra of LSQ13zm show remarkable similarity with those of

gravitational waves. So far theoretical models and simulations have been unable
to predict directly the SMBH merger timescale from ab-initio galaxy formation
theory, focusing only on limited phases of the orbital decay of SMBHs under
idealized conditions of the galaxy hosts. The predicted SMBH merger timescales
are long, of order Gyrs, which could be problematic for future gravitational
wave searches. Here we present the first multi-scale $\Lambda$CDM cosmological
simulation that follows the orbital decay of a pair of SMBHs in a merger of two
typical massive galaxies at $z\sim3$, all the way to the final coalescence
driven by gravitational wave emission. The two SMBHs, with masses $\sim10^{8}$
M$_{\odot}$, settle quickly in the nucleus of the merger remnant. The remnant
is triaxial and extremely dense due to the dissipative nature of the merger and
the intrinsic compactness of galaxies at high redshift. Such properties
naturally allow a very efficient hardening of the SMBH binary. The SMBH merger
occurs in only $\sim10$ Myr after the galactic cores have merged, which is two
orders of magnitude smaller than the Hubble time.

that exploring its nuances can yield new insights. Comprising nothing more than

just a short-lived phase among more typical star-forming galaxies? To explore
this problem further, we investigate the clustering of SMGs identified in the

the halo masses for this large sample of SMGs and compare them with passive and
star-forming galaxies selected in the same field. We find that SMGs, on
average, occupy high-mass dark matter halos (M$_{\text{halo}}
>10^{13}$M$_{\odot}$) at redshifts $z > 2.5$, consistent with being the
progenitors of massive quiescent galaxies in present-day galaxy clusters. We
also find evidence of downsizing, in which SMG activity shifts to lower mass
halos at lower redshifts. In terms of their clustering and halo masses, SMGs
appear to be consistent with other star-forming galaxies at a given redshift.

optical and on to the x-ray have attempted to uncover signs of type Ia
supernovae (SNe Ia) interacting with a circumstellar medium (CSM). The goal of
these studies is to constrain the nature of the hypothesized SN Ia mass-donor
companion. A continuous CSM is typically assumed when interpreting observations
of interaction. However, while such models have been successfully applied to
core-collapse SNe, the assumption of continuity may not be accurate for SNe Ia,
as shells of CSM could be formed by pre-supernova eruptions (novae). In this
work, we model the interaction of SNe with a spherical, low density,
finite-extent CSM and create a suite of synthetic radio synchrotron light
curves. We find that CSM shells produce sharply peaked light curves, and
identify a fiducial set of models that all obey a common evolution and can be
used to generate radio light curves for interaction with an arbitrary shell.
The relations obeyed by the fiducial models can be used to deduce CSM
properties from radio observations; we demonstrate this by applying them to the
non-detections of SN 2011fe and SN 2014J. Finally, we explore a multiple shell
CSM configuration and describe its more complicated dynamics and resultant
radio light curves.

observational constraints on these quantities. In order to make a more direct

deficiency of the underlying model. It seems unlikely that additional
unresolved variability can account for this difference. The simulation shows a
similar `downsizing' of the AGN population as seen in observational surveys.

requires adding a SU(3)_L x SU(3)_R x Z(3)_A nonet of scalar fields, with both
parities, and coupling these to quarks through a Yukawa coupling, y. Treating
the scalar fields in mean field approximation, the effective Lagrangian is
computed by integrating out quarks to one loop order. In addition to the usual
symmetry breaking term, linear in the current quark mass m_qk, at a nonzero
temperature T it is necessary to add a new term, ~ m_qk T^2. The parameters of
the gluon part of the matrix model are identical to that for the pure glue
theory without quarks. The parameters in the chiral matrix model are fixed by
the values, at zero temperature, of the pion decay constant and the masses of
the pions, kaons, eta, and eta'. The temperature for the chiral crossover at
T_chi = 155 MeV is determined by adjusting the Yukawa coupling y. We find
reasonable agreement with the results of numerical simulations on the lattice
for the pressure and related quantities. In the chiral limit, besides the
divergence in the chiral susceptibility there is also a milder divergence in
the susceptibility between the Polyakov loop and the chiral order parameter,
with critical exponent beta - 1. We compute derivatives with respect to a quark
chemical potential to determine the susceptibilities for baryon number, the
chi_2n. Especially sensitive tests are provided by chi_4 - chi_2 and by chi_6,
which changes in sign about T_chi. The behavior of the susceptibilities in the
chiral matrix model strongly suggests that as the temperature increases from
T_chi, that the transition to deconfinement is significantly quicker than
indicated by the measurements of the (renormalized) Polyakov loop on the

quasars is detectable in the polarization properties of the background sources.
The polarization properties appear to be correlated with the presence of
intervening MgII absorption, which is thought to arise in outflowing material
from star forming galaxies. In order to investigate this further, we have
obtained high spectral resolution polarization measurements, with the VLA and
ATCA, of a set of 49 unresolved quasars for which we have high quality optical
spectra. These enable us to produce a Faraday Depth spectrum for each source,
using Rotation Measure Synthesis. Our new independent radio data confirms that
interveners are strongly associated with depolarization. We characterize the
complexity of the Faraday Depth spectrum using a number of parameters and show
how these are related, or not, to the depolarization and to the presence of
MgII absorption along the line of sight. We argue that complexity and structure
in the Faraday Depth distribution likely arise from both intervening material
and intrinsically to the background source and attempt to separate these. We
find that the strong radio depolarization effects associated with intervening
material at redshifts out to $z \approx 1$ arise from inhomogeneous Faraday
screens producing a dispersion in Rotation Measure across individual sources of
around 10~rad/m$^2$. This is likely produced by disordered fields with
strengths of at least $3\;\mu$G.

galaxies using the axis ratio dependence of optical-NIR colour, as measured by
the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS), the Two Micron All Sky Survey (2MASS), and
the Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE). In order to avoid to the
greatest extent possible attenuation-driven biases, we carefully select
galaxies using dust attenuation-independent near- and mid-IR luminosities and
colours. Relative u-band attenuation between face-on and edge-on disc galaxies
along the star forming main sequence varies from ~0.55 mag up to ~1.55 mag. The
strength of the relative attenuation varies strongly with both specific star
formation rate and galaxy luminosity (or stellar mass). The dependence of
relative attenuation on luminosity is not monotonic, but rather peaks at
$M_{3.4\mu m} \approx -21.5$, corresponding to $M_* \approx 3\times
10^{10}M_{Sun}$. This behavior stands seemingly in contrast to some older
studies; we show that older works failed to reliably probe to higher
luminosities, and were insensitive to the decrease in attenuation with
increasing luminosity for the brightest star-forming discs.
Back-of-the-envelope scaling relations predict the strong variation of dust
optical depth with specific star formation rate and stellar mass. More in-depth
comparisons using the scaling relations to model the relative attenuation
require the inclusion of star-dust geometry to reproduce the details of these
variations (especially at high luminosities), highlighting the importance of
these geometrical effects.

TRIPPy: TRailed Image Photometry in Python. TRIPPy introduces the pill
aperture, which is the natural extension of the circular aperture appropriate
for linearly trailed sources. The pill shape is a rectangle with two
semicircular end-caps, and is described by three parameters, the trail length
and angle, and the radius. The TRIPPy software package also includes a new
technique to generate accurate model point-spread functions (PSF) and trailed
point-spread functions (TSF) from stationary background sources in sidereally
tracked images. The TSF is merely the convolution of the model PSF, which
consists of a moffat profile, and super sampled lookup table. From the TSF,
accurate pill aperture corrections can be estimated as a function of pill
radius with a accuracy of 10 millimags for highly trailed sources. Analogous to
the use of small circular apertures and associated aperture corrections, small
radius pill apertures can be used to preserve signal-to-noise of low flux
sources, with appropriate aperture correction applied to provide an accurate,
unbiased flux measurement at all SNR.

electric dipoles can be disregarded unless the volume fraction of the GNPs is
unrealistically high, or if there are some other electric dipole mechanisms

indicates that an inductive heating (induced eddy currents inside the metal

increase the heating locally provided that the supplied magnetic field can be
made sufficiently strong at radio frequency. This paper presents a near field
optimization approach to study the electromagnetic heating of conductive
nanoparticles. An optimization problem is formulated where the power absorption
inside the nanoparticles is maximized subjected to power constraints related to
the skin effect in the surrounding medium. The analysis shows that when the

Slingshots are known to shoot faster under some circumstances when the bands
are tapered rather than having constant width and stiffness. We give both
qualitative understanding and numerical predictions of this effect. We consider
two models. The first is based on conservation of energy and is easier to
implement, but cannot determine the speeds along the rubber bands without
making assumptions. The second, treats the bands as a series of mass points
subject to being pulled by immediately adjacent mass points according to how
much the rubber has been stretched on the two adjacent sides. This is a classic
many-body F=ma problem but convergence requires using a particular numerical
technique. It gives accurate predictions (average error +2%, standard deviation
3%). The basis for these models involves measurements of pull-force vs.
pull-distance. We will show how such measurements can be scaled for increased
width or length, so that minimal calibration measurements are needed to support
the models. With a good physical model of a slingshot one is easily able to
test a wide range of parameters to determine how to get the fastest shots for a

under mild conditions this attains a stationary distribution that depends on
the distribution of the numbers of eggs per batch, the probability an egg
hatches and the distributions of the times between batches and bee lifetime.
This allows an analytic examination of the effect of changing these quantities.

applications in a variety of research areas, including plasmonics and
near-field radiative heat transfer. Even though the optical properties of bulk
metals at elevated temperatures have been studied, the temperature-dependent
data for thin metal films, with thicknesses ranging from few tens to few
hundreds of nanometers, is largely missing. In this work we report on the
optical constants of single- and polycrystalline gold thin films at elevated
temperatures in the wavelength range from 370 to 2000 nm. Our results show that
while the real part of the dielectric function changes marginally with
increasing temperature, the imaginary part changes drastically. For
200-nm-thick single- and polycrystalline gold films the imaginary part of the
dielectric function at 500 0C becomes nearly twice larger than that at room
temperature. In contrast, in thinner films (50-nm and 30-nm) the imaginary part
can show either increasing or decreasing behavior within the same temperature
range and eventually at 500 0C it becomes nearly 3-4 times larger than that at
room temperature. The increase in the imaginary part at elevated temperatures
significantly reduces the surface plasmon polariton propagation length and the
quality factor of the localized surface plasmon resonance for a spherical
particle. We provide experiment-fitted models to describe the
temperature-dependent gold dielectric function as a sum of one Drude and two
Critical Point oscillators. These causal analytical models could enable
accurate multiphysics modelling of gold-based nanophotonic and plasmonic

turbulent velocities that greatly exceed the electron thermal velocities within

thermal Comptonization in determining the emergent spectrum. Bulk
Comptonization by divergenceless turbulence is due to radiation viscous
dissipation only. It can be treated as thermal Comptonization by solving the
Kompaneets equation with an equivalent ""wave"" temperature, which is a weighted
sum over the power present at each scale in the turbulent cascade. Bulk
Comptonization by turbulence with non-zero divergence is due to both pressure
work and radiation viscous dissipation. Pressure work has negligible effect on
photon spectra in the limit of optically thin turbulence, and in this limit
radiation viscous dissipation alone can be treated as thermal Comptonization
with a temperature equivalent to the full turbulent power. In the limit of
extremely optically thick turbulence, radiation viscous dissipation is
suppressed, and the evolution of local photon spectra can be understood in
terms of compression and expansion of the strongly coupled photon and gas
fluids. We discuss the consequences of these effects for self-consistently
resolving and interpreting turbulent Comptonization in spectral calculations in

algorithm proceeds by first identifying low score nodes that should not be

in recent years. Despite the rapid progress, the emphasis of the research
community in the last decade has remained largely concentrated on improving the
design of energy harvester (so-called rectenna) and has left aside the effect
of transmitter design. In this paper, we study the design of transmit waveform
so as to enhance the DC power at the output of the rectenna. We derive a
tractable model of the non-linearity of the rectenna and compare with a linear
model conventionally used in the literature. We then use those models to design
novel multisine waveforms that are adaptive to the channel state information
(CSI). Interestingly, while the linear model favours narrowband transmission
with all the power allocated to a single frequency, the non-linear model
favours a power allocation over multiple frequencies. Through realistic
simulations, waveforms designed based on the non-linear model are shown to
provide significant gains (in terms of harvested DC power) over those designed
based on the linear model and over non-adaptive waveforms. We also compute
analytically the theoretical scaling laws of the harvested energy for various
waveforms as a function of the number of sinewaves and transmit antennas. Those
scaling laws highlight the benefits of CSI knowledge at the transmitter in WPT
and of a WPT design based on a non-linear rectenna model over a linear model.
Results also motivate the study of a promising architecture relying on
large-scale multisine multi-antenna waveforms for WPT. As a final note, results
stress the importance of modeling and accounting for the non-linearity of the

beautiful, computationally efficient, and efficiently parallelizable way to
solve hyperbolic partial differential equations. These properties make them
highly desirable for numerical calculations in relativistic astrophysics and
many other fields. The BSSN formulation of the Einstein equations has
repeatedly demonstrated its robustness. The formulation is not only stable but
allows for puncture-type evolutions of black hole systems. To-date no one has
been able to solve the full (3+1)-dimensional BSSN equations using DGFE
methods. This is partly because DGFE discretization often occurs at the level
of the equations, not the derivative operator, and partly because DGFE methods
are traditionally formulated for manifestly flux-conservative systems. By
discretizing the derivative operator, we generalize a particular flavor of DGFE
methods, Local DG methods, to solve arbitrary second-order hyperbolic
equations. Because we discretize at the level of the derivative operator, our
method can be interpreted as either a DGFE method or as a finite differences
stencil with non-constant coefficients.

applied on two sequence classification tasks, dialogue act detection and key
term extraction. In the sequence labeling tasks, the model input is a sequence,
and the output is the label of the input sequence. The major difficulty of
sequence labeling is that when the input sequence is long, it can include many
noisy or irrelevant part. If the information in the whole sequence is treated
equally, the noisy or irrelevant part may degrade the classification
performance. The attention mechanism is helpful for sequence classification
task because it is capable of highlighting important part among the entire
sequence for the classification task. The experimental results show that with
the attention mechanism, discernible improvements were achieved in the sequence
labeling task considered here. The roles of the attention mechanism in the
tasks are further analyzed and visualized in this paper.

area surfaces in $AdS_3 \subset AdS_5$ was discussed based on a Schroedinger
equation with a periodic potential determined by the Schwarzian derivative of
the shape of the Wilson loop. Here we use the Mathieu equation, a standard
example of a periodic potential, to obtain a class of Wilson loops such that
the area of the dual minimal area surface can be computed analytically in terms
of eigenvalues of such equation. As opposed to previous examples, these minimal
surfaces have an umbilical point (where the principal curvatures are equal) and
are invariant under $\lambda$-deformations. In various limits they reduce to
the single and multiple wound circular Wilson loop and to the regular
light-like polygons studied by Alday and Maldacena. In this last limit, the
periodic potential becomes a series of deep wells each related to a light-like
segment. Small corrections are described by a tight--binding approximation. In
the circular limit they are well approximated by an expansion developed by
A.Dekel. In the particular case of no umbilical points they reduce to a
previous solution proposed by J. Toledo. The construction works both in
Euclidean and Minkowski signature of $AdS_3$.

work has found that frame rate matters to general perception, however a
critical question is which of these animation and data properties affects the
perceptual accuracy of judgement tasks, and to what extent. Although graphical
perception has been well studied for static data visualizations, it is ripe for
exploration in the animated setting. We designed two animated judgment tasks of
a target bar in an animated bar chart and empirically evaluate the effects of 2
animations properties - highlighting of the target bar and frame rate - as well
as 3 data properties that affect the target bar's value throughout the
animation. In short, we find that the rate and timing of animation changes is
easier detected in larger values; that encodings such as color are easier to

include our treatment of far-from-equilibrium degenerate statistics and
QC-based modeling of surface-roughness scattering, as well as considering
quantum-confined phonon and impurity scattering in 3D. Typical MC simulations
approximate degenerate carrier populations as Fermi distributions to model the
Pauli-blocking (PB) of scattering to occupied final states. To allow for
increasingly far-from-equilibrium non-Fermi carrier distributions in
ultra-scaled devices, we instead generate the final-state occupation
probabilities used for PB by sampling the local carrier populations as a
function of energy and energy valley. This process is aided by the use of
fractional carriers or sub-carriers, which minimizes classical carrier-carrier
scattering. Quantum confinement effects are addressed through
quantum-correction potentials (QCPs) generated from Schr\""{o}dinger-Poisson
solvers, as commonly done. However, we use our valley- and
orientation-dependent QCPs not just to redistribute carriers in real space, or
even among energy valleys, but also to calculate confinement-dependent phonon,
impurity, and surface-roughness scattering rates. FinFET simulations are used

the pressure induced by the confinement, which increased with decreasing

for dendritic filtering by low-pass filtering the delivered synaptic current.
Filter parameters are computed numerically and independently for inhibitory and
excitatory input using a Green's function approach. Next, point-neuron models
for each neuron in the microcircuit are fit to their respective morphologically
detailed counterparts. Here, generalized integrate-and-fire point neuron models
are used, leveraging a recently published fitting toolbox. The fits are
constrained by currents and voltages computed in the morphologically detailed

well constrained by the reference circuit, and can be continuously updated as
the latter iteratively integrates new data. The modularity of the approach
makes it applicable also for other point-neuron and synapse models. The
approach is demonstrated on a recently reported reconstruction of a neocortical

Over multiple training sessions, participants learned to associate semantic

found in gardens) with novel objects. Functional magnetic resonance imaging was
used to examine VTC activity for objects before and after learning.
Multivariate pattern similarity analyses revealed that, after learning, VTC
activity patterns carried information about the learned contextual associations
of the objects, such that objects with contextual associations exhibited higher
pattern similarity after learning. Further, these learning-induced increases in
pattern information about contextual associations were correlated with
reductions in pattern information about the objects visual features. In a

Perey-Buck type interaction, and compared to local equivalent calculations.
Using the distorted wave Born approximation we construct the T-matrix for (p,d)
transfer on 17O, 41Ca, 49Ca, 127Sn, 133Sn, and 209Pb at 20 and 50 MeV.
Additionally we studied (p,d) reactions on 40Ca using the the nonlocal
dispersive optical model. We have also included nonlocality consistently into
the adiabatic distorted wave approximation and have investigated the effects of
nonlocality on on (d,p) transfer reactions for deuterons impinged on 16O, 40Ca,
48Ca, 126Sn, 132Sn, 208Pb at 10, 20, and 50 MeV. We found that for bound states
the Perry corrected wave functions resulting from the local equation agreed
well with that from the nonlocal equation in the interior region, but
discrepancies were found in the surface and peripheral regions. Overall, the
Perey correction factor was adequate for scattering states, with the exception
for a few partial waves. Nonlocality in the proton scattering state reduced the
amplitude of the wave function in the nuclear interior. The same was seen for
nonlocality in the deuteron scattering state, but the wave function was also
shifted outward. In distorted wave Born approximation studies of (p,d)
reactions using the Perey-Buck potential, we found that transfer distributions
at the first peak differed by 15-35% as compared to the distribution resulting
from local potentials. When using the dispersive optical model, this
discrepancies grew to 30-50%. When nonlocality was included consistently within
the adiabatic distorted wave approximation, the disagreement was found to be
~40%. This highlights the necessity to pursue reaction formalisms that include
nonlocality exactly.

Grohe and Marx (AGM) for queries with no FD, in which case there are known
algorithms running within AGM bound and thus are worst-case optimal.
  A main result of this paper is an algorithm for computing join queries with
FDs, running within GLVV bound up to a poly-log factor. In particular, our
algorithm is worst-case optimal for any query where the GLVV bound is tight. As
an unexpected by-product, our algorithm manages to solve a harder problem,
where (some) input relations may have prescribed maximum degree bounds, of
which both functional dependencies and cardinality bounds are special cases.
  We extend Gottlob et al. framework by replacing all variable subsets with the
lattice of closed sets (under the given FDs). This gives us new insights into
the structure of the worst-case bound and worst-case instances. While it is
still open whether GLVV bound is tight in general, we show that it is tight on
distributive lattices and some other simple lattices. Distributive lattices
capture a strict superset of queries with no FD and with simple FDs. We also
present two simpler algorithms which are also worst-case optimal on
distributive lattices within a single-$\log$ factor, but they do not match GLVV
bound on a general lattice. Our algorithms are designed based on a novel
principle: we turn a proof of a polymatroid-based output size bound into an

keeping the computation perfectly secret. Whereas in some protocols a user can
verify that calculated outcomes are correct, a third party cannot do this,
which allows a dishonest user or owner to benefit illegally. I propose a new
blind quantum computation protocol with a new property called public
verifiability, which enables any third party to assure that a party does not

  Game-Theoretic Perspective",,,,,"cs.CR cs.GT cs.IT cs.SY math.IT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Data injection attacks have recently emerged as a significant threat on the
smart power grid. By launching data injection attacks, an adversary can
manipulate the real-time locational marginal prices to obtain economic
benefits. Despite the surge of existing literature on data injection, most such
works assume the presence of a single attacker and assume no cost for attack or
defense. In contrast, in this paper, a model for data injection attacks with
multiple adversaries and a single smart grid defender is introduced. To study
the defender-attackers interaction, two game models are considered. In the
first, a Stackelberg game model is used in which the defender acts as a leader
that can anticipate the actions of the adversaries, that act as followers,
before deciding on which measurements to protect. The existence and properties
of the Stackelberg equilibrium of this game are studied. To find the
equilibrium, a distributed learning algorithm that operates under limited
system information is proposed and shown to converge to the game solution. In
the second proposed game model, it is considered that the defender cannot
anticipate the actions of the adversaries. To this end, we proposed a hybrid
satisfaction equilibrium - Nash equilibrium game and defined its equilibrium
concept. A search algorithm is also provided to find the equilibrium of the
hybrid game. Numerical results using the IEEE 30-bus system are used to
illustrate and analyze the strategic interactions between the attackers and
defender. Our results show that by defending a very small set of measurements,
the grid operator can achieve an equilibrium through which the optimal attacks
have no effect on the system. Moreover, our results show how, at equilibrium,
multiple attackers can play a destructive role towards each other, by choosing
to carry out attacks that cancel each other out, leaving the system unaffected.

unsupervised and semi-supervised methods that require no or minimal training

excitations. This is confirmed by the numerical calculations at finite

$\sigma^{xy}_\mathrm{spin}\sim2(e/2\pi)$, predicting gapless edge modes
carrying the spin current, while the helical edge modes in the single-particle

electric field. In negative fields and in positive fields greater than 600
V/cm, the total number of ground comic ray positrons and electrons increases
with increasing electric field strength. And these values increase more
obviously when involving a shower with lower primary energy or a higher zenith
angle. While in positive fields ranging from 0 to 600 V/cm, the total number of
ground comic ray positrons and electrons declines and the amplitude is up to
3.1% for vertical showers. A decrease of intensity occurs for inclined showers
in positive fields less than 500 V/cm, which is accompanied by smaller
amplitudes. In this paper, the intensity changes are discussed, especially
concerning the decreases in positive electric fields. Our simulation results

J1024$-$0719 by the telescopes participating in the European Pulsar Timing
Array (EPTA). These observations reveal a significant second derivative of the
pulsar spin frequency and confirm the discrepancy between the parallax and
Shklovskii distances that has been reported earlier. We also present optical
astrometry, photometry and spectroscopy of 2MASS J10243869$-$0719190. We find
that it is a low-metallicity main-sequence star (K7V spectral type,
$\mathrm{[M/H]}=-1.0$, $T_\mathrm{eff}=4050\pm50$ K) and that its position,
proper motion and distance are consistent with those of PSR J1024$-$0719. We
conclude that PSR J1024$-$0719 and 2MASS J10243869$-$0719190 form a common
proper motion pair and are gravitationally bound. The gravitational interaction
between the main-sequence star and the pulsar accounts for the spin frequency
derivatives, which in turn resolves the distance discrepancy. Our observations
suggest that the pulsar and main-sequence star are in an extremely wide
($P_\mathrm{b}>200$ yr) orbit. Combining the radial velocity of the companion
and proper motion of the pulsar, we find that the binary system has a high
spatial velocity of $384\pm45$ km s$^{-1}$ with respect to the local standard
of rest and has a Galactic orbit consistent with halo objects. Since the
observed main-sequence companion star cannot have recycled the pulsar to
millisecond spin periods, an exotic formation scenario is required. We
demonstrate that this extremely wide-orbit binary could have evolved from a
triple system that underwent an asymmetric supernova explosion, though find
that significant fine-tuning during the explosion is required. Finally, we
discuss the implications of the long period orbit on the timing stability of
PSR J1024$-$0719 in light of its inclusion in pulsar timing arrays.

  subsurface flow",,,,,"math.NA","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  This work presents a model reduction approach to the inverse problem in the
application of subsurface flows. For the Bayesian inverse problem, the forward
model needs to be repeatedly computed for a large number of samples to get a
stationary chain. This requires large computational efforts. To significantly
improve the computation efficiency, we use generalized multiscale finite
element method and least-squares stochastic collocation method to construct a
reduced computational model. To avoid the difficulty of choosing regularization
parameter, hyperparameters are introduced to build a hierarchical model. We use
truncated Karhunen-Loeve expansion (KLE) to reduce the dimension of the
parameter spaces and decrease the mixed time of Markov chains. The techniques
of hyperparameter and KLE are incorporated into the model reduction method. The
reduced model is constructed offline. Then it is computed very efficiently in
the online sampling stage. This strategy can significantly accelerate the
evaluation of the Markov chain and the resultant posterior distribution
converges fast. We analyze the convergence for the approximation between the
posterior distribution by the reduced model and the reference posterior
distribution by the full-order model. A few numerical examples in subsurface
flows are carried out to demonstrate the performance of the presented model
reduction method with application of the Bayesian inverse problem.

shows that the vertical detachment energy (VDE) of these anions exceeds to that
of halogen, and therefore they behave as superhalogen anions. Consequently, it
might be possible to design new electrolytic salts using other superhalogen
anions. We have explored this possibility using Li-salts of various
superhalogen anions such as BO2-, AlH4-, TiH5- and VH6- as well as hyperhalogen
anions, BH4-y(BH4)y-(y = 1 to 4). Our density functional calculations show that
Li-salts of these complex anions possess similar characteristics as those of
electrolytic salts in LIBs. Note that they all are halogen free and hence,
non-toxic and safer than LiBF4, LiPF6 etc. In particular, LiB4H13 and LiB5H16
are two potential candidates for electrolytic salt due to their smaller
Li-dissociation energy ({\Delta}E) than those of LiBF4, LiPF6 etc. We have also
noticed that {\Delta}E of LiBH4-y(BH4)y varies inversely with the VDE of
BH4-y(BH4)y- anions, which increases with the increase in y. These findings may

young cluster in the center of the HII region with a limiting magnitude of K =
18.0 mag (10sigma), which corresponds to a mass detection limit of ~0.2 M_sun.
This enables the comparison of star-forming properties under low metallicity
with those of the solar neighborhood. We identified 89 cluster members. From
the fitting of the K-band luminosity function (KLF), the age and distance of
the cluster are estimated to be ~0.5 Myr and ~4 kpc, respectively. The
estimated young age is consistent with the detection of strong CO emission in
the cluster region and the estimated large extinction of cluster members (Av ~
4--25 mag). The observed KLF suggests that the underlying initial mass function
(IMF) of the low-metallicity cluster is not significantly different from
canonical IMFs in the solar neighborhood in terms of both high-mass slope and
IMF peak (characteristic mass). Despite the very young age, the disk fraction
of the cluster is estimated at only 27pm6 %, which is significantly lower than
those in the solar metallicity. Those results are similar to Sh 2-207, which is
another low-metallicity star-forming region close to Sh 2-208 with a separation
of 12 pc,suggesting that their star-forming activities in low-metallicity
environments are essentially identical to those in the solar neighborhood,
except for the disk dispersal timescale. From large-scale mid-infrared images,
we suggest that sequential star formation is taking place in Sh 2-207, Sh 2-208
and the surrounding region, triggered by an expanding bubble with a ~30 pc
radius.

Interestingly, by combining mathematically the coherence of formation to the

leads to the superadditivity property for the coherence increasing power of

In particular, sufficient conditions are presented for both stability (almost

(possibly) non-diminishing gradient errors. In addition to ensuring stability,
such an algorithm is shown to converge to a small neighborhood of the minimum
set, which depends on the gradient errors. It is worth noting that the main
result of this paper can be used to show that GD with asymptotically vanishing
errors indeed converges to the minimum set. The results presented herein are
not only more general when compared to previous results, but our analysis of GD
with errors is new to the literature to the best of our knowledge. Our work
extends the contributions of Mangasarian & Solodov, Bertsekas & Tsitsiklis and
Tadic & Doucet. Using our framework, a simple yet effective implementation of
GD using simultaneous perturbation stochastic approximations (SP SA), with
constant sensitivity parameters, is presented. Another important improvement
over many previous results is that there are no `additional' restrictions
imposed on the step-sizes. In machine learning applications where step-sizes
are related to learning rates, our assumptions, unlike those of other papers,
do not affect these learning rates. Finally, we present experimental results to
validate our theory.

spatial and temporal resolution observations were recorded simultaneously with
G-band filtergrams and Narrow-band Filter Imager (NFI) Stokes I and V images
with Hinode /Solar Optical Telescope. The GBPs are identified and tracked in
the G-band images automatically, and the corresponding longitudinal magnetic
field strength of each GBP is extracted from the calibrated NFI magnetograms by
a point-to-point method. After categorizing the GBPs into five groups by their
longitudinal magnetic field strengths, we analyze the dynamics of GBPs of each
group. The results suggest that with increasing longitudinal magnetic field
strengths of GBPs correspond to a decrease in their horizontal velocities and
motion ranges as well as by showing more complicated motion paths. This
suggests that magnetic elements showing weaker magnetic field strengths prefer
to move faster and farther along straighter paths, while stronger ones move
more slowly in more erratic paths within a smaller region. The dynamic
behaviors of GBPs with different longitudinal magnetic field strengths can be
explained by that the stronger flux concentrations withstand the convective
flows much better than weaker ones.

the electric conductivity in low frequency limit shows a Drude peak and that in
the intermediate frequency regime it reveals the power law behavior.
Especially, when the anisotropy increases the exponent of the power law becomes
smaller. In addition, we find that there exist a critical value for the
anisotropy at which the DC conductivity reaches to its maximum value.

(MR) spectroscopy under ambient conditions. Our method relies on
cross-relaxation between a probe spin, the electronic spin of a
nitrogen-vacancy centre in diamond, and target spins as the two systems are
tuned into resonance. By optically monitoring the spin relaxation time ($T_1$)
of the probe spin while varying the amplitude of an applied static magnetic
field, a frequency spectrum of the target spin resonances, a $T_1$-MR spectrum,
is obtained. As a proof of concept, we measure $T_1$-MR spectra of a small
ensemble of $^{14}$N impurities surrounding the probe spin within the diamond,
with each impurity comprising an electron spin 1/2 and a nuclear spin 1. The
intrinsically large bandwidth of the technique and probe properties allows us
to detect both electron spin transitions -- in the GHz range -- and nuclear
spin transitions -- in the MHz range -- of the $^{14}$N spin targets. The
measured frequencies are found to be in excellent agreement with theoretical
expectations, and allow us to infer the hyperfine, quadrupole and gyromagnetic
constants of the target spins. Analysis of the strength of the resonances
obtained in the $T_1$-MR spectrum reveals that the electron spin transitions
are probed via dipole interactions, while the nuclear spin resonances are
dramatically enhanced by hyperfine coupling and an electron-mediated process.
Finally, we investigate theoretically the possibility of performing $T_1$-MR
spectroscopy on nuclear spins without hyperfine interaction and predict
single-proton sensitivity using current technology. This work establishes
$T_1$-MR as a simple yet powerful technique for nanoscale MR spectroscopy, with
broadband capability and a projected sensitivity down to the single nuclear

the cell's capacity to maintain metabolic enzymes. The necessary enzyme amount
per unit flux is a major determinant of metabolic strategies both in evolution
and bioengineering. It depends on enzyme parameters (such as kcat and KM
constants), but also on metabolite concentrations. Moreover, similar amounts of
different enzymes might incur different costs for the cell, depending on
enzyme-specific properties such as protein size and half-life. Here, we
developed enzyme cost minimization (ECM), a scalable method for computing
enzyme amounts that support a given metabolic flux at a minimal protein cost.
The complex interplay of enzyme and metabolite concentrations, e.g. through
thermodynamic driving forces and enzyme saturation, would make it hard to solve
this optimization problem directly. By treating enzyme cost as a function of
metabolite levels, we formulated ECM as a numerically tractable, convex
optimization problem. Its tiered approach allows for building models at
different levels of detail, depending on the amount of available data.
Validating our method with measured metabolite and protein levels in E. coli
central metabolism, we found typical prediction fold errors of 3.8 and 2.7,
respectively, for the two kinds of data. ECM can be used to predict enzyme
levels and protein cost in natural and engineered pathways, establishes a
direct connection between protein cost and thermodynamics, and provides a
physically plausible and computationally tractable way to include enzyme
kinetics into constraint-based metabolic models, where kinetics have usually
been ignored or oversimplified.

method of optimizing an unknown function for which every measurement is

optimizing a given acquisition function. After a sufficient number of
measurements, a recommendation about the maximum is made. However, a key
realization is that the maximum of a Gaussian process is not a deterministic

cannot be calculated analytically. Our main contribution is an algorithm,
inspired by sequential Monte Carlo samplers, that approximates this maximum
distribution. Subsequently, by taking samples from this distribution, we enable
Thompson sampling to be applied to (armed-bandit) optimization problems with a

a nonlinear acquisition function. Experiments have shown that the resulting

existence and brightness of such images is important for investigation of the
central mass distributions of lensing galaxies, but only one secure detection
has been made so far in a galaxy-scale lens system. The noise levels achieved
in our new B1030+074 images reach 3 microJy/beam and represent an improvement
in central image constraints of nearly an order of magnitude over previous
work, with correspondingly better resulting limits on the shape of the central
mass profile of the lensing galaxy. Simple models with an isothermal outer
power law slope now require either the influence of a central supermassive
black hole, or an inner power law slope very close to isothermal, in order to
suppress the central image below our detection limit. Using the central mass
profiles inferred from light distributions in Virgo galaxies, moved to z=0.5,
and matching to the observed Einstein radius, we now find that 45% of such mass
profiles should give observable central images, 10% should give central images

been estimated from ab-initio Density Functional Theory. A model for the
diffusion of the trimer based in rotations yields a simple explanation of why
the cluster can diffuse faster than a single water molecule by a factor
$\approx 10^{2}$. This model is based on the differences between the adsorption
geometry for the three monomers forming the cluster. One member interacts
strongly with the surface and sits closer to the surface (d) while the other
two interact weakly and stay at a larger separation from the surface (u). The
trimer rotates nearly freely around the axis determined by the d monomer.
Translations of the whole trimer imply breaking the strong interaction of the d
monomer with the surface. Alternatively, thermal fluctuations exchange the
actual monomer sitting closer to the surface with a lower energetic cost.
Rotations around different axis introduce a diffusion mechanism where a strong
interaction is kept along the diffusion path between the water molecule

chance to study the interaction between human mobility and social relations.
This work is a step towards quantifying whether a location is suitable for
conducting social activities, and the notion is named location sociality. Being
able to quantify location sociality creates practical opportunities such as
urban planning and location recommendation. To quantify a location's sociality,
we propose a mixture model of HITS and PageRank on a heterogeneous network
linking users and locations. By exploiting millions of check-in data generated
by Instagram users in New York and Los Angeles, we investigate the relation
between location sociality and several location properties, including location
categories, rating and popularity. We further perform two case studies, i.e.,
friendship prediction and location recommendation, experimental results
demonstrate the usefulness of our quantification.

agreement with each other. As the calculated MCA energy significantly differs
from experiment, it is clear that many-body effects beyond the local density

effects for FePt are accounted for by solving the full Dirac equation or
whether the spin-orbit coupling (SOC) is treated as a correction to the

energy on the magnetization angle and on the SOC strength it follows that the
main mechanism of MCA in FePt can be described within second order perturbation
theory. However, a distinct contribution not accountable for by second order

conservation of the isospin due to the nonzero mass difference of the $K^+$ and
$K^0$ mesons. They result in the appearance of the narrow resonance structure
in the $\pi^+\pi^-$ mass spectrum in the region of the $K\bar K$ thresholds,
with the width $\approx2m_{K^0}-2m_{K^+}\approx8$ MeV. The observation of such
a structure in experiment is the direct indication on the $K\bar K$ loop
mechanism of the breaking of the isotopic invariance. We point out that
existing data should be more precise, and it is difficult to explain them using
the single specific mechanism from those listed above. Taking the decay

the H(z) measurements obtained with cosmic chronometer from the BOSS survey

important also to constrain neutrino properties by breaking or reducing
degeneracies with other parameters. We find that $N_{eff}=3.17\pm0.15$, thus
excluding the possibility of an extra (sterile) neutrino at more than

a good tracer of molecular outflows, and how the two tracers are connected.
Fourteen objects in our sample have a broad wing component as traced by [CII],
and all of these also show OH119 absorption indicative of an outflow (in 1 case
an inflow). The other eight cases, where no broad [CII] component was found,
are predominantly objects with no OH outflow or a low-velocity ($\leq
100\,\text{km s}^{-1}$) OH outflow. The full width at half maximum (FWHM) of
the broad [CII] component shows a trend with the OH119 blue-shifted velocity,
although with significant scatter. Moreover, and despite large uncertainties,
the outflow masses derived from OH and broad [CII] show a 1:1 relation. The
main conclusion is therefore that broad [CII] wings can be used to trace
molecular outflows. This may be particularly relevant at high redshift, where
the usual tracers of molecular gas (like low-J CO lines) become hard to
observe. Additionally, observations of blue-shifted Na I D $\lambda\lambda

of Na I D show a trend with OH velocity and broad [CII] FWHM. These
observations suggest that the atomic and molecular gas phases of the outflow

final temperature at a hot background. In stark contrast,
electromagnetic-induced-transparency (EIT) cooling with a $\Lambda$-system
produces significant negative cooling rate at high motional excitation. At

of combined spiral and giant molecular cloud (GMC) heating on the discs we
introduce massive, short-lived particles that sample a GMC mass function. An

histories of star formation and radial scale growth. Models with GMCs and
standard values for the disc mass and halo density provide the right level of
self-gravity to explain the age velocity dispersion relation of the Solar

profiles with scaleheights that are radially constant and agree with
observations of galactic thin discs. GMCs are also capable of significantly
delaying bar formation. The amount of spiral induced radial migration agrees

mutually-dependent singing voice separation and vocal fundamental frequency
(F0) estimation. Vocal F0 estimation is considered to become easier if singing
voices can be separated from a music audio signal, and vocal F0 contours are
useful for singing voice separation. This calls for an approach that improves
the performance of each of these tasks by using the results of the other. The
proposed method first performs robust principal component analysis (RPCA) for
roughly extracting singing voices from a target music audio signal. The F0
contour of the main melody is then estimated from the separated singing voices
by finding the optimal temporal path over an F0 saliency spectrogram. Finally,
the singing voices are separated again more accurately by combining a
conventional time-frequency mask given by RPCA with another mask that passes
only the harmonic structures of the estimated F0s. Experimental results showed
that the proposed method significantly improved the performances of both
singing voice separation and vocal F0 estimation. The proposed method also
outperformed all the other methods of singing voice separation submitted to an
international music analysis competition called MIREX 2014.

need $\Omega(n^{2/3})$ queries in the worst case, otherwise they still need
$\Omega(n)$ queries similarly to Las Vegas algorithms. All our bounds

and, for the first time, image the dust emission, the molecular gas
distribution, and the kinematics from a 7-10 pc-diameter disk that represents
the submillimeter counterpart of the putative torus of NGC 1068. We fitted the
nuclear spectral energy distribution of the torus using ALMA and near and
mid-infrared (NIR/MIR) data with CLUMPY models. The mass and radius of the
best-fit solution for the torus are both consistent with the values derived
from the ALMA data alone: Mgas_torus=(1+-0.3)x10^5 Msun and Rtorus=3.5+-0.5 pc.
The dynamics of the molecular gas in the torus show non-circular motions and
enhanced turbulence superposed on the rotating pattern of the disk. The
kinematic major axis of the CO torus is tilted relative to its morphological
major axis. By contrast with the nearly edge-on orientation of the H2O
megamaser disk, we have found evidence suggesting that the molecular torus is
less inclined (i=34deg-66deg) at larger radii. The lopsided morphology and
complex kinematics of the torus could be the signature of the
Papaloizou-Pringle instability, long predicted to likely drive the dynamical
evolution of active galactic nuclei (AGN) tori.

the few remaining open problems from the list of open questions in algorithmic
randomness by Miller and Nies in 2006. The halting probability of a prefix-free
machine M restricted to a set X is the probability that the machine halts and
outputs an element of X. These numbers Omega_M(X) were studied by a number of

When X is the complement of a computably enumerable set, the number Omega_M(X)
is the difference of two halting probabilities. Becher, Figueira, Grigorieff,

kinetic model to predict the resistive force ($F$) dependent velocity ($P(v)$)
and run-length ($P(n)$) distribution functions of generic finitely processive
molecular motors that take forward and backward steps on a track. Our theory
quantitatively explains the zero force kinesin-1 data for both $P(n)$ and
$P(v)$ using the detachment rate as the only parameter, thus allowing us to
obtain the variations of these quantities under load. At non-zero $F$, $P(v)$
is non-Gaussian, and is bimodal with peaks at positive and negative values of
$v$. The prediction that $P(v)$ is bimodal is a consequence of the discrete
step-size of kinesin-1, and remains even when the step-size distribution is
taken into account. Although the predictions are based on analyses of kinesin-1
data, our results are general and should hold for any processive motor, which
walks on a track by taking discrete steps.

also result in an indefinite increase in the settling time of clock recovery
circuits, particularly in low swing mesochronous systems. Mesochronous clock
retiming circuits are required in repeaterless low swing on-chip interconnects.
We first discuss how timing jitter can result in a large increase in the
settling time of the clock recovery circuit. Next, the circuit is modelled as a
Markov chain with absorbing states. The mean time to absorption of the Markov
chain, which represents the mean settling time of the circuit, is determined.
The model is validated through behavioural simulations of the circuit, the
results of which match well with the model predictions. We consider circuits
with (i) data dependent jitter, (ii) random jitter, and (iii) combination of
both of them. We show that a mismatch between the strengths of up and down
corrections of the retiming can reduce the settling time. In particular, a 10%
mismatch can reduce the mean settling time by up to 40%. We leverage this fact
toward improving the settling time performance, and propose useful techniques
based on biased training sequences and mismatched charge pumps. We also present
a coarse+fine clock retiming circuit, which can operate in coarse first mode,
to reduce the settling time substantially. These fast settling retiming
circuits are verified with circuit simulations.

the accretion flow velocity at the white dwarf surface, which is normally close
to the free-fall velocity. This allows to estimate the white dwarf masses as
the white dwarf mass-radius relation M-R and the expected free-fall velocities
at the surface are well known. This method is widely used, however, derived
white dwarf masses M can be systematically underestimated because the accretion
flow is stopped at and re-accelerates from the magnetospheric boundary R_m, and
therefore, its velocity at the surface will be lower than free-fall.To avoid
this problem we computed a two-parameter set of model hard X-ray spectra, which
allows to constrain a degenerate M - R_m dependence. On the other hand,
previous works showed that power spectra of accreting X-ray pulsars and
intermediate polars exhibit breaks at the frequencies corresponding to the
Keplerian frequencies at the magnetospheric boundary. Therefore, the break
frequency \nu_b in an intermediate polar power spectrum gives another relation
in the M - R_m plane. The intersection of the two dependences allows,
therefore, to determine simultaneously the white dwarf mass and the
magnetospheric radius. To verify the method we analyzed the archival Suzaku
observation of EX Hya obtaining M /M_sun= 0.73 \pm 0.06 and R_ m / R = 2.6 \pm
0.4 consistent with the values determined by other authors. Subsequently, we
applied the same method to a recent NuSTAR observation of another intermediate
polar GK~Per performed during an outburst and found M/M_sun = 0.86 \pm 0.02 and
R_ m / R = 2.8 \pm 0.2. The long duration observations of GK Per in quiescence

degree. The irregular chromatic index $\chi_{\rm irr}'(G)$ of a graph $G$ is
the smallest number of locally irregular subgraphs needed to edge-decompose
$G$. Not all graphs have such a decomposition, but Baudon, Bensmail,
Przyby{\l}o, and Wo\'zniak conjectured that if $G$ can be decomposed into
locally irregular subgraphs, then $\chi_{\rm irr}'(G)\leq 3$. In support of
this conjecture, Przyby{\l}o showed that $\chi_{\rm irr}'(G)\leq 3$ holds
whenever $G$ has minimum degree at least $10^{10}$.
  Here we prove that every bipartite graph $G$ which is not an odd length path
satisfies $\chi_{\rm irr}'(G)\leq 10$. This is the first general constant upper
bound on the irregular chromatic index of bipartite graphs. Combining this
result with Przyby{\l}o's result, we show that $\chi_{\rm irr}'(G) \leq 328$
for every graph $G$ which admits a decomposition into locally irregular
subgraphs. Finally, we show that $\chi_{\rm irr}'(G)\leq 2$ for every
$16$-edge-connected bipartite graph $G$.

state of matter at nuclear density can be extracted from the gravitational
waves emitted by merging neutron-star binaries. We present a comprehensive
analysis of the gravitational-wave signal emitted during the inspiral, merger
and post-merger of 56 neutron-star binaries. This sample of binaries, arguably
the largest studied to date with realistic equations of state, spans across six
different nuclear-physics equations of state and ten masses, allowing us to
sharpen a number of results recently obtained on the spectral properties of the
gravitational-wave signal. Overall we find that: (i) for binaries with masses
differing no more than $20\%$, the frequency at gravitational-wave amplitude's
maximum is related quasi-universally with the tidal deformability of the two
stars; (ii) the spectral properties vary during the post-merger phase, with a
transient phase lasting a few millisecond after the merger and followed by a
quasi-stationary phase; (iii) when distinguishing the spectral peaks between
these two phases, a number of ambiguities in the identification of the peaks
disappear, leaving a simple and robust picture; (iv) using properly identified
frequencies, quasi-universal relations are found between the spectral features
and the properties of the neutron stars; (v) for the most salient peaks
analytic fitting functions can be obtained in terms of the stellar tidal
deformability or compactness. Altogether, these results support the idea that
the equation of state of nuclear matter can be constrained tightly when a
signal in gravitational waves from binary neutron stars is detected.

tangent bifurcation exhibit intermittency and this circumstance has been
exploited, e.g. by Procaccia and Schuster [Phys. Rev. A 28, 1210 (1983)], to
develop a general theory of 1/f spectra. This suggests it is interesting to
study the extent to which the behavior of a high-dimensional stochastic system
can be described by such tangent maps. The Tangled Nature (TaNa) Model of
evolutionary ecology is an ideal candidate for such a study, a significant
model as it is capable of reproducing a broad range of the phenomenology of
macroevolution and ecosystems. The TaNa model exhibits strong intermittency
reminiscent of Punctuated Equilibrium and, like the fossil record of mass
extinction, the intermittency in the model is found to be non-stationary, a
feature typical of many complex systems. We derive a mean-field version for the
evolution of the likelihood function controlling the reproduction of species
and find a local map close to tangency. This mean-field map, by our own local
approximation, is able to describe qualitatively only one episode of the
intermittent dynamics of the full TaNa model. To complement this result we
construct a complete nonlinear dynamical system model consisting of successive
tangent bifurcations that generates time evolution patterns resembling those of
the full TaNa model in macroscopic scales. In spite of the limitations of our
approach, that entails a drastic collapse of degrees of freedom, the
description of a high-dimensional model system in terms of a low-dimensional
one appears to be illuminating.

effect of the South Atlantic Anomaly. The effect is marginal for high amplitude
variable stars but it could be critical in the case of low amplitude variables,
especially if the frequency range of the intrinsic variation overlaps the
interval of the instrumental frequencies. Some tests were carried out both on
synthetic and real data for distinguishing technical and stars' frequencies.

features are relevant and which are not. The information bottleneck method (IB)
by Tishby, Pereira, and Bialek formalized this notion as an
information-theoretic optimization problem and proposed an optimal tradeoff
between throwing away as many bits as possible, and selectively keeping those
that are most important. In the IB, compression is measure my mutual
information. Here, we introduce an alternative formulation that replaces mutual
information with entropy, which we call the deterministic information
bottleneck (DIB), that we argue better captures this notion of compression. As
suggested by its name, the solution to the DIB problem turns out to be a
deterministic encoder, or hard clustering, as opposed to the stochastic
encoder, or soft clustering, that is optimal under the IB. We compare the IB
and DIB on synthetic data, showing that the IB and DIB perform similarly in
terms of the IB cost function, but that the DIB significantly outperforms the
IB in terms of the DIB cost function. We also empirically find that the DIB
offers a considerable gain in computational efficiency over the IB, over a
range of convergence parameters. Our derivation of the DIB also suggests a
method for continuously interpolating between the soft clustering of the IB and
the hard clustering of the DIB.

By the Kronecker decomposition Theorem, they admit a normal form. This normal
form consists of four parts, one part based on the Jordan canonical form, one
part made of nilpotent matrices, and two other dual parts, which we call the
observation and control part. The goal of this paper is to show that large
portions of that decomposition are still valid for pairs of morphisms of
modules or abelian groups, and more generally in any abelian category. % This
gives a new perspective even in the vector space case, as we have to use
radically new proof techniques to work on abelian categories. In the vector
space case, we recover the full Kronecker decomposition theorem. The main
technique is that of reduction, which extends readily to the abelian category
case. Reductions naturally arise in two flavours, which are dual to each other.
There are a number of properties of those reductions which extend remarkably
from the vector space case to abelian categories. First, both types of
reduction commute. Second, at each step of the reduction, one can compute three
sequences of invariant spaces (objects in the category), which generalize the
Kronecker decomposition into nilpotent, observation and control blocks. These
sequences indicate whether the system is reduced in one direction or the other.
In the category of modules, there is also a relation between these sequences
and the resolvent set of the pair of morphisms, which generalizes the regular
pencil theorem. We also indicate how this allows to define invariant subspaces
in the vector space case, and study the notion of strangeness as an example.

involves solving Laplace's equation with Dirichlet boundary conditions on
multiply connected and unbounded domains and propagating the interface using a
normal velocity obtained from the solution of the PDE at each time step. Our
method is based on a simple formulation for implicit interfaces, which rewrites
boundary integrals as volume integrals over the entire space. The resulting
algorithm thus inherits the benefits of both level set methods and boundary
integral methods to simulate the nonlocal front propagation problem with
possible topological changes. We present numerical results in both two and

Mn and Ti dopant ions. The effect of dopant ions on the Sr$_3$Ru$_2$O$_7$ band
structure has been included by taking into account the dopant induced
suppression of the oxygen octahedral rotation in the tight binding band
structure and changes in electron occupation. We find that the low energy spin
fluctuations are dominated by three wave vectors around
Q=$((0,0),(\pi/2,\pi/2))$, and $(\pi,0)$ which compete with each other. As the
octahedral rotation is suppressed with increasing doping, the three wave
vectors evolve differently. In particular, the undoped compound has dominant
wavevectors at Q=$((0,0),(\pi/2,\pi/2))$, but doping Sr$_3$Ru$_2$O$_7$ leads to
a significant enhancement in the spin susceptibility at the Q=$(\pi,0)$
wavevector bringing the system closer to a magnetic instability. All the
features calculated from our model are in agreement with neutron scattering
experiments. We have also studied the effect of a c-axis Zeeman field on the
low energy spin fluctuations. We find that an increasing magnetic field
suppresses the AFM fluctuations and leads to stronger competition between the
AFM and FM spin fluctuations. The magnetic field dependence observed in our
calculations therefore supports the scenario that the observed nematic phase in
the metamagnetic region in Sr$_3$Ru$_2$O$_7$ is intimately related to the
presence of a competing ferromagnetic instability.

The effect of the EF and of a resonant magnetic perturbation (RMP) on the TM,

of the Modified Rutherford Equation. In the experiment, the TM amplitude is
measured as a function of the toroidal angle as the TM rotates rapidly in the

amplitude is fixed while the toroidal phase is varied from one discharge to the
other, completing a full toroidal scan. Using three such scans with different
RMP amplitudes, the EF amplitude and phase are inferred from the phases at
which the TM amplitude maximizes. The estimated EF amplitude is consistent with
other estimates (e.g. based on the best EF-cancelling RMP, resulting in the
fastest TM rotation). A passive variant of this technique is also presented,
where no RMPs are applied, and the EF phase is deduced.

along a flexible beam. The flow is modelled using lubrication theory and the
substrate is modelled as an elastica which deforms according to the
Euler-Bernoulli equation. A constant flux of liquid is supplied at one end of
the beam, which is clamped horizontally, while the other end of the beam is
free. As the liquid film spreads, its weight causes the beam deflection to
increase, which in turn enhances the spreading rate of the liquid. This
feedback mechanism causes the front position ${\sigma}$(t) and the deflection
angle at the front ${\phi}$(t) to go through a number of different power-law
behaviours. For early times, the liquid spreads like a horizontal gravity
current, with ${\sigma}$(t) = $t^{4/5}$ and ${\phi}$(t) = $t^{13/5}$. For
intermediate times, the deflection of the beam leads to rapid acceleration of
the liquid layer, with ${\sigma}$(t) = $t^4$ and ${\phi}$(t) = $t^9$. Finally,
when the beam has sagged to become almost vertical, the liquid film flows
downward with ${\sigma}$(t) = $t$ and ${\phi}$(t) ~ ${\pi}$/2. We demonstrate

We
address this problem in this work by generalizing the infinitesimal BRST
transformations in de Sitter spacetime to finite field-dependent BRST (FFBRST)
transformations. These FFBRST transformations are symmetry of the classical
action, but do not leave path integral measure invariant for the graviton
theory in de Sitter spacetime. Due to the non-trivial Jacobian of such finite
transformation the path integral measure changes and hence FFBRST
transformation is capable of relating theories in two different gauges. We
explicitly construct FFBRST transformation which relates theory with diverging
graviton two-point function to theory with infrared (IR) finite graviton. The
FFBRST transformation thus establishes that divergence in graviton two-point
function may be only a gauge artifact.

transport engineering aiming to recover flows from every Origin to every
Destination from measured traffic counts and a priori model information. In
addition to traffic counts, the present contribution takes advantage of probe
trajectories, whose capture is made possible by new measurement technologies.
It extends the concept of ODM to that of Link dependent ODM (LODM), keeping the
information about the flow distribution on links and containing inherently the
ODM assignment. Further, an original formulation of LODM estimation, from
traffic counts and probe trajectories is presented as an optimisation problem,
where the functional to be minimized consists of five convex functions, each
modelling a constraint or property of the transport problem: consistency with
traffic counts, consistency with sampled probe trajectories, consistency with
traffic conservation (Kirchhoff's law), similarity of flows having close
origins and destinations, positivity of traffic flows. A primal-dual algorithm
is devised to minimize the designed functional, as the corresponding objective
functions are not necessarily differentiable. A case study, on a simulated
network and traffic, validates the feasibility of the procedure and details its
benefits for the estimation of an LODM matching real-network constraints and
observations.

spatially flat Friedmann-Lemaitre-Robertson-Walker universe for the
gravitationally induced particle creation scenario with constant specific
entropy and an arbitrary particle creation rate $\Gamma$. Assuming a perfect
fluid equation of state $p=(\gamma -1)\rho$ with $\frac{2}{3} \leq \gamma \leq
2$, the first law, the generalized second law (GSL), and thermodynamic
equilibrium have been studied and an expression for the total entropy (i.e.,
horizon entropy plus fluid entropy) has been obtained which does not contain
$\Gamma$ explicitly. Moreover, a lower bound for the fluid temperature $T_f$
has also been found which is given by $T_f \geq
8\left(\frac{\frac{3\gamma}{2}-1}{\frac{2}{\gamma}-1}\right)H^2$. It has been
shown that the GSL is satisfied for $\frac{\Gamma}{3H} \leq 1$. Further, when
$\Gamma$ is constant, thermodynamic equilibrium is always possible for
$\frac{1}{2}<\frac{\Gamma}{3H} < 1$, while for $\frac{\Gamma}{3H} \leq
\text{min}\left\lbrace \frac{1}{2},\frac{2\gamma -2}{3\gamma -2} \right\rbrace$
and $\frac{\Gamma}{3H} \geq 1$, equilibrium can never be attained.
Thermodynamic arguments also lead us to believe that during the radiation
phase, $\Gamma \leq H$. When $\Gamma$ is not a constant, thermodynamic
equilibrium holds if $\ddot{H} \geq \frac{27}{4}\gamma ^2 H^3
\left(1-\frac{\Gamma}{3H}\right)^2$, however, such a condition is by no means
necessary for the attainment of equilibrium.

control, for battery energy storage system (BESS) owners that participate in
the primary frequency control (PFC) market. Specifically, the optimal BESS
control minimizes the operating cost by keeping the state of charge (SoC) in an
optimal range. Through rigorous analysis, we prove that the optimal BESS
control is a ""state-invariant"" strategy in the sense that the optimal SoC range
does not vary with the state of the system. As such, the optimal control
strategy can be computed offline once and for all with very low complexity.
Regarding the BESS planning, we prove that the the minimum operating cost is a
decreasing convex function of the BESS energy capacity. This leads to the
optimal BESS sizing that strikes a balance between the capital investment and
operating cost. Our work here provides a useful theoretical framework for
understanding the planning and control strategies that maximize the economic
benefits of BESSs in ancillary service markets.

  oscillators: a biological interpretation","12 pages , 5 figures",,,,"nlin.AO math-ph math.MP","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Non-linear oscillator networks have revealed properties as the remote
synchronization and the quorum sensing. The remote synchronization, defined as
the synchronization of nodes not directly connected by any sequence of
synchronized nodes, was found firstly in networks of amplitude oscillators and
recently in bipartite delayed networks of phase oscillators. The quorum
sensing, a biological information scheme discovered in cell aggregates, has
been investigated in amplitude oscillators coupled by a common medium.
Implications of such findings are important in technology and biology. We show
both of them in non-bipartite, biologically plausible networks of Kuramoto
oscillators. The quorum sensing emerges using the graph edge density, while the
remote synchronization is obtained by means of an oscillator acting as a
pacemaker. In the remote synchronization two distinct groups of well inter and
infra-synchronized nodes, separated by non-synchronized paths, appear clearly.
Our biological interpretation is that the remote synchronization, bypassing the
normal quorum sensing mechanism, is responsible of the pathological cell
proliferation. This approach seems suitable to study the quorum sensing
alterations due to genetic mutation or to the environmental action before the
actual mass replication begins.

and the spin-orbit coupling within the Dirac theory. Whereas the algebra for
the anomalous Zeeman effect is impeccable and therefore in excellent agreement
with experiment, the physical interpretation of that algebra uses images that
are based on macroscopic intuition but do not correspond to the meaning of this
algebra. The interpretation violates the Lorentz symmetry. We give an
alternative intuitive description of the meaning of this effect, which respects
the symmetry and is exact. It can be summarized by stating that a magnetic
field makes any charged particle spin. We show also that the traditional
discussion about magnetic monopoles confuses two issues, viz. the symmetry of
the Maxwell equations and the quantization of charge. These two issues define
each a different concept of magnetic monopole. They cannot be merged together
into a unique all-encompassing issue. We also generalize the minimal
substitution for a charged particle, and provide some intuition for the
magnetic vector potential. We finally explore the algebra of the spin-orbit
coupling, which turns out to be badly wrong. The traditional theory that is
claimed to reproduce the Thomas half is based on a number of errors. An
error-free application of the Dirac theory cannot account for the Thomas
precession, because it only accounts for the instantaneous local boosts, not
for the rotational component of the Lorentz transformation. This runs contrary
to established beliefs, but Thomas precession can be understood in terms of the
Berry phase on a path through the velocity space of the Lorentz group manifold.
These results clearly reveal the limitations of the prevailing working
philosophy to ""shut up and calculate"".
