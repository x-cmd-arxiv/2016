exhibit a rotation-dependent heat capacity. However, as equilibrium is
approached, a new effect is identified here wherein the temperature does not
grow homogeneously in the radial direction, but develops a temperature
differential with the hottest region on axis, at the maximum of the centrifugal
potential energy. This phenomenon, which we call a piezo-thermal effect, is
shown to grow bilinearly with the compression rate and the amplitude of the
potential. Numerical simulations confirm a simple model of this effect, which
can be generalized to other forms of potential energy and methods of heating.

stage of evolution ($\leq 10^4$ yr). Our data show an interacting pair of
galaxies, projected separation 9.1 kpc, velocity difference $\Delta(v)=216$ km

spheroidal with the emission-line spectrum of a high-excitation young radio
AGN, e.g. strong [OI]6300 and [OIII]5007. Emission-line ratios indicate a large
contribution to the line luminosity from high-velocity shocks ($\simeq 550$ km
$\rm s^{-1}$) . The companion is a non-AGN disk galaxy, with extended $\rm
H\alpha$ emission from which its star-formation rate is estimated as $\rm
0.61~M_{\odot}yr^{-1}$.
  Both galaxies show rotational velocity gradients in $\rm H\alpha$ and other
lines, with the interaction being prograde-prograde. The SE-NW velocity
gradient of the AGN host is misaligned from the E-W radio axis, but aligned
with a previously discovered central ultraviolet source, and a factor 2 greater

of [OI]6300 is redshifted. In spectral fits, both galaxies have old stellar

shock microphysics enters at different stages of shock formation, shock
dynamics and particle energization and/or acceleration. It turns out that the
shock phenomenon is a multi-scale non-linear problem in time and space. It is
complexified by the impact due to high-energy cosmic rays in astrophysical
environments. This review adresses the physics of shock formation, shock
dynamics and particle acceleration based on a close examination of available
multi-wavelength or in-situ observations, analytical and numerical
developments. A particular emphasize is made on the different instabilities
triggered during the shock formation and in association with particle
acceleration processes with regards to the properties of the background
upstream medium. It appears that among the most important parameters the
background magnetic field through the magnetization and its obliquity is the
dominant one. The shock velocity that can reach relativistic speeds has also a
strong impact over the development of the micro-instabilities and the fate of
particle acceleration. Recent developments of laboratory shock experiments has

prevent such attacks because they do not control access to the speaker at all
and fail to control when untrusted apps may use the microphone, enabling
authorized apps to create exploitable communication channels. In this paper, we
propose a security mechanism that tracks the creation of audio communication
channels explicitly and controls the information flows over these channels to
prevent several types of attacks.We design and implement AuDroid, an extension
to the SELinux reference monitor integrated into the Android operating system
for enforcing lattice security policies over the dynamically changing use of
system audio resources. To enhance flexibility, when information flow errors
are detected, the device owner, system apps and services are given the
opportunity to resolve information flow errors using known methods, enabling
AuDroid to run many configurations safely. We evaluate our approach on 17
widely-used apps that make extensive use of the microphone and speaker, finding
that AuDroid prevents six types of attack scenarios on audio channels while
permitting all 17 apps to run effectively. AuDroid shows that it is possible to
prevent attacks using audio channels without compromising functionality or

$b$-matching, instead of disjointness we require that every element appears in
at most $b$ sets of the subcollection. Our main result is a linear-programming
based $(k-1+\tfrac{1}{k})$-approximation algorithm for $k$-hypergraph
$b$-matching. This settles the integrality gap when $k$ is one more than a
prime power, since it matches a previously-known lower bound. When the
hypergraph is bipartite, we are able to improve the approximation ratio to
$k-1$, which is also best possible relative to the natural LP. These results
are obtained using a more careful application of the \emph{iterated packing}
method.
  Using the bipartite algorithmic integrality gap upper bound, we show that for
the family of combinatorial auctions in which anyone can win at most $t$ items,
there is a truthful-in-expectation polynomial-time auction that
$t$-approximately maximizes social welfare. We also show that our results
directly imply new approximations for a generalization of the recently
introduced bounded-color matching problem.
  We also consider the generalization of $b$-matching to \emph{demand
matching}, where edges have nonuniform demand values. The best known
approximation algorithm for this problem has ratio $2k$ on $k$-hypergraphs. We
give a new algorithm, based on local ratio, that obtains the same approximation

Using HIFI on the Herschel Space Observatory we detect, for the first time, the

chemistry of ammonia and water to infer the amounts of gas-phase molecules of

the millimeter-sized grains) and two vertical distributions (near the midplane
where water is expected to photodesorb off icy grains) to describe the
(unknown) location of the molecules. These distributions capture the effects of
radial drift and vertical settling of ice-covered grains. We use
physical-chemical models to reproduce the fluxes with assuming that water and
ammonia are co-spatial. We infer ammonia gas-phase masses of 0.7-11.0
$\times$10$^{21}$ g. For water, we infer gas-phase masses of 0.2-16.0

measurements as low as 1 Pa. We use the capabilities of this design to perform
an extensive set of rheo-electric experiments on gels formulated from
attractive carbon black particles, at concentrations ranging from 4 to 15% wt.
First, experiments on gels at rest prepared with different shear history show a
robust power-law scaling between the elastic modulus $G'_0$ and the
conductivity $\sigma_0$ of the gels, i.e. $G'_0 \sim \sigma_0^\alpha$, with
$\alpha =1.65 \pm 0.04$ independently of the gel concentration. Second,
conductivity measurements performed simultaneously with creep experiments
reveal for the first time that plastic events take place in the bulk while the
shear rate decreases as a weak power law of time in the early stage of the
experiment. The subsequent evolution of the conductivity and shear rate allows
us to propose a local yielding scenario that is in agreement with previous
velocimetry measurements. Finally, we determine the constitutive rheological
and electrical behavior of carbon black gels. Corrections first introduced for
mechanical measurements are carefully extended to electrical measurements to
accurately distinguish between bulk and surface contributions to the
conductivity. As an illustrative example, we examine the constitutive
rheo-electric properties of five carbon black gels of different grades, and
demonstrate the relevance of the novel rheo-electric apparatus as a versatile

uptake capacity of MOF-74 under humid conditions originate in the water
dissociation reaction H$_2$O$\rightarrow$OH+H at the metal centers. After this
dissociation, the OH groups coordinate to the metal centers, explaining the
reduction in the MOF's CO$_2$ uptake capacity. This reduction thus strongly
depends on the catalytic activity of MOF-74 towards the water dissociation
reaction. We further show that-while the water molecules themselves only have a
negligible effect on the crystal structure of MOF-74-the OH and H products of
the dissociation reaction significantly weaken the MOF framework and lead to
the observed crystal structure breakdown. With this knowledge, we propose a way
to suppress this particular reaction by modifying the MOF-74 structure to
increase the water dissociation energy barrier and thus control the stability
of the system under humid conditions.

time to meet ever-changing requirements. Evolution imposes changes to feature
models in terms of edit operations. Ensuring consistency of concurrent edits
requires appropriate conflict detection techniques. However, recent approaches
fail to handle crucial subtleties of extended feature models, namely
constraints mixing feature-tree patterns with first-order logic formulas over
non-Boolean feature attributes with potentially infinite value domains. In this
paper, we propose a novel conflict detection approach based on symbolic graph
transformation to facilitate concurrent edits on extended feature models. We
describe extended feature models formally with symbolic graphs and edit

eMoflon with an SMT solver, and evaluated with respect to applicability.

One important approach to quantum operations is to use an extra quantum system

interactions between separated quantum registers, and by using fresh ancillas

Using the max flow-min cut principle, a theorem from network theory, we rewrite
the RT formula in a way that does not make reference to the minimal surface.
Instead, we invoke the notion of a ""flow"", defined as a divergenceless
norm-bounded vector field, or equivalently a set of Planck-thickness ""bit
threads"". The entanglement entropy of a boundary region is given by the maximum
flux out of it of any flow, or equivalently the maximum number of bit threads

points on the boundary, and naturally implement the holographic principle. As
we explain, this new picture clarifies several conceptual puzzles surrounding
the RT formula. We give flow-based proofs of strong subadditivity and related
properties; unlike the ones based on minimal surfaces, these proofs correspond
in a transparent manner to the properties' information-theoretic meanings. We
also briefly discuss certain technical advantages that the flows offer over
minimal surfaces. In a mathematical appendix, we review the max flow-min cut
theorem on networks and on Riemannian manifolds, and prove in the network case
that the set of max flows varies Lipshitz continuously in the network
parameters.

studies of metastable samples outside the Lamb-Dicke regime. We discuss several

arguably under-represented in real-world problems. They mainly stem from the
easier construction of such functions and result in improbable properties such
as separability, optima located exactly at the boundary constraints, and the
existence of variables that solely control the distance between a solution and

recommend a general procedure for creating test suites for an arbitrary number

their (known) properties, this paper also aims at giving the rationale behind
our approach in terms of groups of functions with similar properties, objective

function is proposed to be used for the first time to describe the relation
between unemployment rate and inflation rate, also known as the Phillips curve.
The Phillips curve is in the literature often represented by an
exponential-like shape. On the other hand, Phillips in his fundamental paper
used a power function in the model definition. Considering that the ordinary as
well as generalised Mittag-Leffler function behaves between a purely
exponential function and a power function it is natural to implement it in the
definition of the model used to describe the relation between the data
representing the Phillips curve. For the modelling purposes the data of two
different European economies, France and Switzerland, were used and an
""out-of-sample"" forecast was done to compare the performance of the
Mittag-Leffler model to the performance of the power-type and exponential-type
model. The results demonstrate that the ability of the Mittag-Leffler function
to fit data that manifest signs of stretched exponentials, oscillations or even
damped oscillations can be of use when describing economic relations and
phenomenons, such as the Phillips curve.

uncovering the major modes of multivariate interaction among high-dimensional
genomic markers that are potentially associated with cancer. Traditionally,
conditional independence has been studied using sparse Gaussian graphical
models for continuous data and sparse Ising models for discrete data. However,
there are two clear situations when these approaches are inadequate. The first
occurs when the data are continuous but display non-normal marginal behavior
such as heavy tails or skewness, rendering an assumption of normality
inappropriate. The second occurs when a part of the data is ordinal or discrete
(e.g., presence or absence of a mutation) and the other part is continuous
(e.g., expression levels of genes or proteins). In this case, the existing
Bayesian approaches typically employ a latent variable framework for the
discrete part that precludes inferring conditional independence among the data
that are actually observed. The current article overcomes these two challenges
in a unified framework using Gaussian scale mixtures. Our framework is able to
handle continuous data that are not normal and data that are of mixed
continuous and discrete nature, while still being able to infer a sparse
conditional sign independence structure among the observed data. Extensive
performance comparison in simulations with alternative techniques and an

high-speed ultrasound imaging to probe non-invasively how the interior of a

demonstrate that the solidification proceeds without a detectable increase in

provides direct experimental evidence for jamming by shear, rather than

elements are determined mainly based on the long-term traffic behaviour.
However, when the random and hard-to-predict spatio-temporal distribution of
the traffic (load,demand) does not fully match the fixed locations of the RAN
elements (supply), some performance degradation becomes inevitable. The concept
of multi-tier cells (heterogeneous networks, HetNets) has been introduced in 4G
networks to alleviate this mismatch. However, as the traffic distribution
deviates more and more from the long-term average, even the HetNet architecture
will have difficulty in coping up with the erratic supply-demand mismatch,
unless the RAN is grossly over-engineered (which is a financially non-viable
solution). In this article, we study the opportunistic utilization of
low-altitude unmanned aerial platforms equipped with base stations (BSs), i.e.,
drone-BSs, in 5G networks. In particular, we envisage a multi-tier drone-cell
network complementing the terrestrial HetNets. The variety of equipment, and
non-rigid placement options allow utilizing multitier drone-cell networks to
serve diversified demands. Hence, drone-cells bring the supply to where the
demand is, which sets new frontiers for the heterogeneity in 5G networks. We
investigate the advancements promised by drone-cells, and discuss the
challenges associated with their operation and management. We propose a
drone-cell management framework (DMF) benefiting from the synergy among
software defined networking (SDN), network functions virtualization (NFV), and
cloud-computing. We demonstrate DMF mechanisms via a case study, and
numerically show that it can reduce the cost of utilizing drone-cells in

approximate joint measurement of two or more quantum observables. The aim of
this paper is to provide methods to compute optimal bounds of this type. The
basic method is semidefinite programming, which we apply to arbitrary finite
collections of projective observables on a finite dimensional Hilbert space.
The quantification of errors is based on an arbitrary cost function, which
assigns a penalty to getting result $x$ rather than y, for any pair (x,y). This
induces a notion of optimal transport cost for a pair of probability
distributions, and we include an appendix with a short summary of optimal
transport theory as needed in our context. There are then different ways to
form an overall figure of merit from the comparison of distributions. We
consider three, which are related to different physical testing scenarios. The
most thorough test compares the transport distances between the marginals of a
joint measurement and the reference observables for every input state. Less
demanding is a test just on the states for which a ""true value"" is known in the
sense that the reference observable yields a definite outcome. Finally, we can
measure a deviation as a single expectation value by comparing the two
observables on the two parts of a maximally entangled state. All three error
quantities have the property that they vanish if and only if the tested
observable is equal to the reference. The theory is illustrated with some
characteristic examples.

Those findings are consistent with past in situ observations. Both simulations
reproduce the theoretical jump conditions at the shock. However, the PIC code
density and temperature distributions are inflated and slightly shifted sunward
when compared to the MHD results. Kinetic electron motions and reflected ions
upstream may cause this sunward shift. Species distributions in the foreshock
region are depicted within the transition of the shock (measured ~2
c/{\omega}pi for {\Theta}Bn =90o and MMS =4.7 ) and in the downstream. The size
of the foot jump in the magnetic field at the shock is measured to be (1.7

regularization, often called rapidity divergences. Once regulated, a general
framework exists for their renormalization, the rapidity renormalization group
(RRG), leading to fully resummed calculations of transverse momentum (to the

regularization of rapidity divergences. As an example, we examine the
fully-differential factorization of a color singlet's momentum spectrum in a

mother theory to both traditional threshold and transverse momentum
resummation, recovering the classical results for both resummations. Examining
the refactorization of the transverse momentum beam functions in the threshold
region, we show that one can directly calculate the rapidity renormalized
function, while shedding light on the structure of joint resummation. Finally,
we show how using modern bootstrap techniques, the transverse momentum spectrum

mechanism to ensure consistency with local tests of gravity. These screening
mechanisms fit into three broad classes; we investigate theories which are
capable of exhibiting more than one type of screening. Specifically, we focus
on a simple model which exhibits both Vainshtein and kinetic screening. We
point out that due to the two characteristic length scales in the problem, the
type of screening that dominates depends on the mass of the sourcing object,
allowing for different phenomenology at different scales. We consider embedding
this double screening phenomenology in a broader cosmological scenario and show
that the simplest examples that exhibit double screening are radiatively
stable.

evolutionary state of brown dwarfs ambiguous without additional information.
Theoretical models are normally used to help distinguish between old, massive
brown dwarfs and young, low mass brown dwarfs but these models have yet to be
properly calibrated. We have carried out an infrared high-contrast imaging
program with the goal of detecting substellar objects as companions to nearby
stars to help break degeneracies in inferred physical properties such as mass,
age, and composition. Rather than using imaging observations alone, our targets
are pre-selected based on the existence of dynamical accelerations informed
from years of stellar radial velocity (RV) measurements. In this paper, we
present the discovery of a rare benchmark brown dwarf orbiting the nearby
($d=18.69\pm0.19$ pc), solar-type (G9V) star HD 4747 ([Fe/H]=$-0.22\pm0.04$)
with a projected separation of only $\rho=11.3\pm0.2$ AU ($\theta \approx$
0.6""). Precise Doppler measurements taken over 18 years reveal the companion's
orbit and allow us to place strong constraints on its mass using dynamics ($m
\sin(i) = 55.3\pm1.9M_J$). Relative photometry ($\Delta K_s=9.05\pm0.14$,
$M_{K_s}=13.00\pm0.14$, $K_s - L' = 1.34\pm0.46$) indicates that HD 4747 B is
most-likely a late-type L-dwarf and, if near the L/T transition, an intriguing
source for studying cloud physics, variability, and polarization. We estimate a
model-dependent mass of $m=72^{+3}_{-13}M_J$ for an age of $3.3^{+2.3}_{-1.9}$
Gyr based on gyrochronology. Combining astrometric measurements with RV data,
we calculate the companion dynamical mass ($m=60.2\pm3.3M_J$) and orbit
($e=0.740\pm0.002$) directly. As a new mass, age, and metallicity benchmark, HD
4747 B will serve as a laboratory for precision astrophysics to test
theoretical models that describe the emergent radiation of brown dwarfs.

that measure similarities of system generated summaries with a set of human

between the terms and phrases in the sentences; therefore, in cases of
terminology variations and paraphrasing, ROUGE is not as effective. Scientific
article summarization is one such case that is different from general domain
summarization (e.g. newswire data). We provide an extensive analysis of ROUGE's

that, contrary to the common belief, ROUGE is not much reliable in evaluating
scientific summaries. We furthermore show how different variants of ROUGE
result in very different correlations with the manual Pyramid scores. Finally,
we propose an alternative metric for summarization evaluation which is based on
the content relevance between a system generated summary and the corresponding
human written summaries. We call our metric SERA (Summarization Evaluation by

with manual scores which shows its effectiveness in evaluation of scientific

group galaxies by \citet{tzanavaris10} and collaborators with Swift UVOT,
Spitzer IRAC and MIPS 24 \micron\ photometry of a sample of 183 galaxies in 46
compact groups. After correcting luminosities for the contribution from old
stellar populations, we estimate the dust-unobscured star formation rate
(SFR$_{\mathrm{UV}}$) using the UVOT uvw2photometry. Similarly, we use the MIPS
24 \micron\ photometry to estimate the component of the SFR that is obscured by
dust (SFR$_{\mathrm{IR}}$). We find that galaxies which are MIR-active
(MIR-""red""), also have bluer UV colours, higher specific star formation rates,
and tend to lie in H~{\sc i}-rich groups, while galaxies that are MIR-inactive
(MIR-""blue"") have redder UV colours, lower specific star formation rates, and
tend to lie in H~{\sc i}-poor groups. We find the SFRs to be continuously
distributed with a peak at about 1 M$_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$, indicating this might
be the most common value in compact groups. In contrast, the specific star
formation rate distribution is bimodal, and there is a clear distinction
between star-forming and quiescent galaxies. Overall, our results suggest that
the specific star formation rate is the best tracer of gas depletion and galaxy
evolution in compact groups.

silicon (Si) photonic devices at room temperature may help develop practical
applications of quantum photonics. An important characteristic of photon-pair
generation is the two-photon joint spectral intensity (JSI), which describes
the frequency correlations of the photon pair. In particular, heralded
single-photon generation requires uncorrelated photons, rather than the highly
anti-correlated photons conventionally obtained under continuous-wave (CW)
pumping. Recent attempts to achieve such a factorizable JSI have used short
optical pulses from mode-locked lasers, which are much more expensive and
bigger table-top or rack-sized instruments compared to the Si microchip pair
generator, dominate the cost and inhibit the miniaturization of the source.
Here, we generate photon pairs from a Si microring resonator by using an
electronic step-recovery diode to drive an electro-optic modulator which carves
the pump light from a CW optical diode into pulses of the appropriate width,
thus potentially eliminating the need for optical mode-locked lasers.

identified a bright ($M_{\rm UV}\approx -22$) star forming galaxy candidate at
$z \approx 11$. The presence of GN-$z11$ implies a number density $\sim
10^{-6}\,{\rm Mpc^{-3}}$, roughly an order of magnitude higher than the
expected value based on extrapolations from lower redshift. Using the
unprecedented volume and high resolution of the BlueTides cosmological
hydrodynamical simulation, we study the population of luminous rare objects at
$z > 10$. The luminosity function in BlueTides implies an enhanced number of
massive galaxies, consistent with the observation of GN-$z11$. We find about 30
galaxies at $M_{\rm UV}\approx -22$ at $z = 11$ in the BlueTides volume,
including a few objects about 1.5 magnitudes brighter. The probability of
observing GN-$z11$ in the volume probed by Oesch et al. (2016) is $\sim 13$ per
cent. The predicted properties of the rare bright galaxies at $z = 11$ in
BlueTides closely match those inferred from the observations of GN-$z11$.
BlueTides predicts a negligible contribution from faint AGN in the observed
SED. The enormous increase in volume surveyed by WFIRST will provide
observations of $\sim1000$ galaxies with $M_{\rm UV} < -22$ beyond $z = 11$ out
to $z = 13.5$.

systems of interacting chains with memory of variable length. Each chain
describes the activity of a single neuron, indicating whether it spikes or not

evolution of its presynaptic neurons since its last spike time. When a neuron
spikes, its potential is reset to a resting level and postsynaptic current
pulses are generated, modifying the membrane potential of all its postsynaptic
neurons. The relationship between a neuron and its pre- and postsynaptic
neurons defines an oriented graph, the interaction graph of the model. The goal
of this paper is to estimate this graph based on the observation of the spike
activity of a finite set of neurons over a finite time. We provide explicit
exponential upper bounds for the probabilities of under- and overestimating the
interaction graph restricted to the observed set and obtain the strong
consistency of the estimator. Our result does not require stationarity nor

consider an additional narrow band to the otherwise completely localized

small hopping of the localized electrons between neighboring sites of the
lattice. This new model is adequate to study a novel class of intermetallic 4f

orbitals, with J=5/2 multiplet in the presence of spin-orbit coupling. We
present results of the correlation functions and we show that the short range
antiferromagnetic correlations favors the formation of magnetic moments on the
atoms, and at the same time the existence of these moments opens the
possibility of the spin-flip scattering by the conduction electrons, generating
the Kondo effect, which contribute to the opening of a gap in the density of
states of the system. We also calculate the phase diagram which shows that, as

insulator. The band structure calculated shows that the model develops a strong

been seen previously in the Milky Way and nearby spiral galaxies. Furthermore,
the ratio of L(HNC)/L(HCN) ~ 0.3-0.4 does not vary by more than a factor of 1.5
between regions. By comparing our measured ratios to PDR models including
mechanical heating, we find that the ratio of L(HNC)/L(HCN) is consistent with

this is specially the case for the time evolution of a pulsar's magnetic dipole

well known in the context of the classic magnetic dipole radiation, $n<3$ would
only be possible for positive $(\dot{B}_0/B_0 + \dot{\phi}/\tan\phi)$, which,
for instance, leads to $\dot{B}_0>0$ ($\dot{\phi}>0$) when $\phi$ ($B_0$) is

for cross-architecture and cross-domain transfer learning. However, a key
requirement is that training examples are in correspondence across the domains.
We show that in many scenarios of practical importance such aligned data can be
synthetically generated using computer graphics pipelines allowing domain
adaptation through distillation. We apply this technique to learn models for
recognizing low-resolution images using labeled high-resolution images,
non-localized objects using labeled localized objects, line-drawings using
labeled color images, etc. Experiments on various fine-grained recognition
datasets demonstrate that the technique improves recognition performance on the
low-quality data and beats strong baselines for domain adaptation. Finally, we
present insights into workings of the technique through visualizations and

arises when designing the transmit covariance matrices in multiuser
multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) broadcast networks implementing
simultaneous wireless information and power transfer (SWIPT). The MIMO SWIPT
problem is formulated as a general multi-objective optimization problem, in
which data rates and harvested powers are optimized simultaneously. Two
different approaches are applied to reformulate the (nonconvex) multi-objective
problem. In the first approach, the transmitter can control the specific amount
of power to be harvested by power transfer whereas in the second approach the
transmitter can only control the proportion of power to be harvested among the
different harvesting users. The computational complexity will also be
different, with higher computational resources required in the first approach.
In order to solve the resulting formulations, we propose to use the
majorization-minimization (MM) approach. The idea behind this approach is to
obtain a convex function that approximates the nonconvex objective and, then,
solve a series of convex subproblems that will converge to a locally optimal
solution of the general nonconvex multi-objective problem. The solution
obtained from the MM approach is compared to the classical
block-diagonalization (BD) strategy, typically used to solve the nonconvex
multiuser MIMO network by forcing no interference among users. Simulation
results show that the proposed approach improves over the BD approach both the
system sum rate and the power harvested by users. Additionally, the
computational times needed for convergence of the proposed methods are much
lower than the ones required for classical gradient-based approaches.

Correlations between galaxy interaction and star formation have been found in

formation. We present the results of simulations that reconstruct the orbit
trajectories and disturbed morphologies of pairs of interacting galaxies. With
the use of a restricted three-body simulation code and the help of Citizen
Scientists, we sample 10^5 points in parameter space for each system. We
demonstrate a successful recreation of the morphologies of 62 pairs of
interacting galaxies through the review of more than 3 million simulations. We
examine the level of convergence and uniqueness of the dynamical properties of
each system. These simulations represent the largest collection of models of
interacting galaxies to date, providing a valuable resource for the
investigation of mergers. This paper presents the simulation parameters
generated by the project. They are now publicly available in electronic format
at http://data.galaxyzoo.org/mergers.html. Though our best-fit model parameters
are not an exact match to previously published models, our method for
determining uncertainty measurements will aid future comparisons between
models. The dynamical clocks from our models agree with previous results of the
time since the onset of star formation from star burst models in interacting
systems and suggests that tidally induced star formation is triggered very soon

number of triangle-free graphs. Three noteworthy bounds are in terms of the
number of vertices, edges, and maximum degree given by Poljak \& Tuza (1994),
and Johansson. There have been comparatively fewer works extending these types
of bounds to graphs with a small number of triangles. One noteworthy exception
is a result of Alon et. al (1999) bounding the chromatic number for graphs with
low degree and few triangles per vertex; this bound is nearly the same as for
triangle-free graphs. This type of parametrization is much less rigid, and has
appeared in dozens of combinatorial constructions.
  In this paper, we show a similar type of result for $\chi(G)$ as a function
of the number of vertices $n$, the number of edges $m$, as well as the triangle
count (both local and global measures). Our results smoothly interpolate
between the generic bounds true for all graphs and bounds for triangle-free
graphs. Our results are tight for most of these cases; we show how an open
problem regarding fractional chromatic number and degeneracy in triangle-free
graphs can resolve the small remaining gap in our bounds.

Understanding both the fundamental and the technical noise sources was critical
for increasing the observable volume in the universe. The average distance at
which coalescing binary black hole systems with individual masses of 30

neutron star inspirals was about 75 Mpc. With respect to the initial detectors,

revealing the existence of large regions in parameter space which are excluded
for any ${\tilde t_1}\to c \tilde \chi^0_1$ branching ratio. This effect is
then illustrated for scenarios with stop-scharm mixing in the right-handed
sector, where it has previously been observed that the stop mass limits can be
significantly weakened for large mixing. Our analysis shows that once the LHC
bounds from ${\tilde c_1}\to c \tilde \chi^0_1$ searches are taken into
account, non-zero stop-scharm mixing leads only to a modest increase in the
allowed regions of parameter space, with large areas excluded for arbitrary

uncertainty. It is demonstrated on the Cassra/Iris Field. The theory for the
stochastic wavelet derivation (which estimates the seismic noise level along
with the wavelet, time-to-depth mapping, and their uncertainties), the
stochastic sparse spike inversion, and the net pay estimation (using secant
areas) along with its uncertainty; will be outlined. This includes benchmarking
of this methodology on a synthetic model. A critical part of this process is
the calibration of the secant areas. This is done in a two step process. First,
a preliminary calibration is done with the stochastic reflection response
modeling using rock physics relationships derived from the well logs. Second, a
refinement is made to the calibration to account for the encountered net pay at
the wells. Finally, a variogram structure is estimated from the extracted
secant area map, then used to build in the lateral correlation to the ensemble
of net pay maps while matching the well results to within the nugget of the
variogram. These net pay maps are then integrated, over the area of full
saturation gas, to give the GIIP distribution (Gaussian distributions for the
porosity, gas expansion factor, and gas saturation for the sand end member are
assumed and incorporated in the estimate of GIIP). The method is demonstrated
on the Iris (UP5 turbidite) interval. The net pay is corrected for reduction in
the amplitudes over part of the area due to shallow gas. The sensitivity of the
GIIP to the independent stochastic variables is estimated (determining the
value of information) so that business decisions can be made that maximize the
value of the field.

density function ($I^2\chi(\omega)$) obtained from optical data using a maximum
entropy inversion method. We start with two simple model input
$I^2\chi(\omega)$, calculate the optical scattering rates at selected
temperatures using the model input spectral density functions and a generalized
Allen's formula, then extract back $I^2\chi(\omega)$ at each temperature from
the calculated optical scattering rate using the maximum entropy method (MEM)
which has been used for analysis of optical data of high-temperature
superconductors including cuprates, and finally compare the resulting
$I^2\chi(\omega)$ with the input ones. From this approach we find that the
inversion process can recover the input $I^2\chi(\omega)$ almost perfectly when
the quality of fits is good enough and also temperature smearing (or thermal
broadening) effects appear in the $I^2\chi(\omega)$ when the quality of fits is
not good enough. We found that the coupling constant and the logarithmically
averaged frequency are robust to the temperature smearing effects and/or the
quality of fits. We use these robust properties of the two quantities as
criterions to check whether experimental data have intrinsic
temperature-dependent evolutions or not. We carefully apply the MEM to two
material systems (one optimally doped and the other underdoped cuprates) and
conclude that the $I^2\chi(\omega)$ extracted from the optical data contain
intrinsic temperature-dependent evolutions.

design a class of dynamic algorithms which makes packet-by-packet schedul- ing

topological structures, such as span- ning trees. Our algorithms may be
conveniently understood as a non-trivial generalization of the familiar
back-pressure algorithm which makes unicast packet routing and schedul- ing
decisions, based on queue-length information, without maintaining end-to-end

structures due to ab- sence of a work-conservation principle which results from
packet duplications. We design and prove the optimality of a virtual-queue

two approaches of such inference: one based on an M-type statistic constructed

  http://cvgl.stanford.edu/papers/choy_16_appendix.pdf",,,,"cs.CV cs.AI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Inspired by the recent success of methods that employ shape priors to achieve
robust 3D reconstructions, we propose a novel recurrent neural network
architecture that we call the 3D Recurrent Reconstruction Neural Network
(3D-R2N2). The network learns a mapping from images of objects to their
underlying 3D shapes from a large collection of synthetic data. Our network
takes in one or more images of an object instance from arbitrary viewpoints and
outputs a reconstruction of the object in the form of a 3D occupancy grid.
Unlike most of the previous works, our network does not require any image
annotations or object class labels for training or testing. Our extensive
experimental analysis shows that our reconstruction framework i) outperforms
the state-of-the-art methods for single view reconstruction, and ii) enables
the 3D reconstruction of objects in situations when traditional SFM/SLAM
methods fail (because of lack of texture and/or wide baseline).

as special cases, are the most general form of linear isotropic media where the
electric displacement and the magnetic induction are related to both the
electric field and the magnetic intensity. In inhomogeneous bi-isotropic media,
electromagnetic waves of two different polarizations are coupled to each other.
In this paper, we develop a generalized version of the invariant imbedding
method for the study of wave propagation in arbitrarily-inhomogeneous
stratified bi-isotropic media, which can be used to solve the coupled wave
propagation problem accurately and efficiently. We verify the validity and
usefulness of the method by applying it to several examples, including the wave
propagation in a uniform chiral slab, the surface wave excitation in a bilayer
system made of a layer of Tellegen medium and a metal layer, and the mode
conversion of transverse electromagnetic waves into longitudinal plasma
oscillations in inhomogeneous Tellegen media. In contrast to the case of
ordinary isotropic media, we find that the surface wave excitation and the mode
conversion occur for both s and p waves in bi-isotropic media.

the sense that they provide the maximum failure-tolerance for a given number of
parity nodes. Suppose that an MDS code with $k$ information nodes and $r=n-k$
parity nodes is used to encode data in a distributed storage system. It is
known that if $h$ out of the $n$ nodes are inaccessible and $d$ surviving
(helper) nodes are used to recover the lost data, then we need to download at
least $h/(d+h-k)$ fraction of the data stored in each of the helper nodes
(Dimakis et. al., 2010 and Cadambe et al., 2013). If this lower bound is
achieved for the repair of any $h$ erased nodes from any $d$ helper nodes, we
say that the MDS code has the $(h,d)$-optimal repair property.
  We study high-rate MDS array codes with the optimal repair property. Explicit
constructions of such codes in the literature are only available for the cases
where there are at most 3 parity nodes, and these existing constructions can
only optimally repair a single node failure by accessing all the surviving
nodes.
  In this paper, given any $r$ and $n$, we present two explicit constructions
of MDS array codes with the $(h,d)$-optimal repair property for all $h\le r$
and $k\le d\le n-h$ simultaneously. Codes in the first family can be
constructed over any base field $F$ as long as $|F|\ge sn,$ where
$s=\text{lcm}(1,2,\dots,r).$ The encoding, decoding, repair of failed nodes,
and update procedures of these codes all have low complexity. Codes in the
second family have the optimal access property and can be constructed over any
base field $F$ as long as $|F|\ge n+1.$ Moreover, both code families have the
optimal error resilience capability when repairing failed nodes. We also
construct several other related families of MDS codes with the optimal repair
property.

as overlay text is presented in widely varying formats and often with animation

our application on account of their simplicity and speed of operation. However,
these methods are sensitive to thresholds and have high false positive rates.
In this paper, we present a contrast enhancement based preprocessing stage for
overlay text detection and a parameter free edge density based scheme for
efficient text band detection. The second contribution of this paper is a novel
approach for multiple text region tracking with a formal identification of all
possible detection failure cases. The tracking stage enables us to establish
the temporal presence of text bands and their linking over time. The third
contribution is the adoption of Tesseract OCR for the specific task of overlay
text recognition using web news articles. The proposed approach is tested and
found superior on news videos acquired from three Indian English television

the SSTM, we translate the trust evaluation problem to be a nonlinear state
filtering problem. To estimate the state based on the SSTM, a component-wise
iterative state inference procedure is proposed to work in tandem with the
particle filter, and thus the resulting algorithm is termed as iterative
particle filter (IPF). The computational complexity of the IPF algorithm is
theoretically linearly related with the dimension of the state. This property
is desirable especially for high dimensional trust evaluation and state
filtering problems. The performance of the proposed algorithm is evaluated by
both simulations and real data analysis.

and -1 acting on it) is subsumed within the formalism of Gupta-Bleuler for the
quantized free electromagnetic field in the Krein space (i.e. in the ordinary
Hilbert space endowed with the Gupta-Bleuler operator $\eta$). Rigorous
Gupta-Bleuler quantization of the free electromagnetic field is based on a
generalization of ours (published formerly) of the Mackey theory of induced
representations which includes representations preserving the indefinite Krein
inner-product given by the Gupta-Bleuler operator and acting in the Krein
space. The free electromagnetic field is constructed by application of the
Segal's second quantization functor to the specific Krein-isometric
representation. A closed subspace $\mathcal{H}_{\textrm{tr}}$ of the
single-photon Krein space on which the indefinite Krein-inner-product is
strictly positive is constructed such that the Krein-isometric single-photon
representation generates modulo unphysical states precisely the action of a
representation which preserves the positive inner product on
$\mathcal{H}_{\textrm{tr}}$ induced by the Krein inner product, and is equal to
the direct sum of ordinary unitary representations of helicity 1 and -1
respectively. Two states of single photon Krein space are physically equivalent
whenever differ by a state of Krein norm zero and whose projection on
$\mathcal{H}_{\textrm{tr}}$, in the sense of the Krein-inner-product, vanishes.
In particulart it follows that the results of Bia{\l}ynicki-Birula on the
single-photon wave function may be reconciled with the micro-local perturbative

optoelectronic properties of these ultra-long chains are poorly described by
current theoretical models, which are based on short chain experimental data

system in terms of charge transfer and van der Waals interactions is widely
missing. We provide a reference for the intrinsic Raman frequency of polyynes
in vacuo and explicitly describe the interactions between polyynes and carbon
nanotubes. We find that van der Waals interactions strongly shift the Raman
frequency, which has been neither expected nor addressed before. As a
consequence of charge transfer from the tube to the chain, the Raman response
of long chains is qualitatively different from the known phonon dispersion of
polymers close to the $\Gamma$-point. Based on these findings we show how to
correctly interpret the Raman data, considering the nanotube's properties. This
is essential for its use as an analytical tool to optimize the growth process

This method also allows for the computation of oscillator strengths. Here we

Results differ from those in [Phys. Rev. Lett. 115, 027402 (2015)]; the

third Luttinger parameter can be determined by comparisons with experiments,
however, the evaluation of all three Luttinger parameters is not uniquely
possible. Our results are consistent with band structure calculations.
Considering also a finite momentum $\hbar K$ of the center of mass, we show
that the large $K$-dependent line splitting observed for the $1S$ exciton state

shown to reduce to the AdS case studied before once the value of the dynamical
exponent is set to unity and the metric functions are accordingly chosen. The
analytical results we present are general and can be applied to a variety of

clocks from different countries, to meet at a geographical location which is
not fixed in advanced. The robots act independently. They can observe others,
compute some locations and walk towards those locations. They can only get a
snapshot of the locations of other robots but can not detect whether they are
static or in motion. The robots are forgetful; once they have completed their
motion they forget their previous locations and observations. Again they decide
new destinations to move to. Eventually all the robots compute the same
destination and meet there. There exists no global positioning system. As they
stand, they agree on up and down directions. However, as they do not have any
compass, the other directions are not agreed upon. They also do not agree on
the clockwise direction. For determining a strategy, we imagine the robots to
be points on a three dimensional plane where all the robots are mutually
visible to each other always. The strategy we propose has to be obeyed by all
the robots independently with respect to their own clock and compass. Initially
the robots start from distinct locations. Some dead robots may be present in

the live robots are not aware of the presence of these dead robots.

lies in between the well-known notions of Bell nonlocality and entanglement.
Moreover, quantum steering is also related to several asymmetric quantum
information protocols where some of the parties are considered untrusted.
Because of these facts, quantum steering has received a lot of attention both
theoretically and experimentally. The main goal of this review is to give an
overview of how to characterise quantum steering through semidefinite
programming. This characterisation provides efficient numerical methods to
address a number of problems, including steering detection, quantification, and

  The accurate representation of the evolution of a discontinuous stochastic

Adaptivity of the stochastic basis to reduce computational cost is challenging
in the stochastic Galerkin setting since the change of basis affects the system
matrix itself. To achieve adaptivity without adding overhead by rewriting the
entire system of equations for every grid cell, we devise a basis reduction
method that distinguishes between locally significant and insignificant modes
without changing the actual system matrices.

studied BH4-x(BH4)x- (x = 1 to 4) hyperhalogen anions and their Li-complexes,
LiBH4-x(BH4)x using density functional theory. The VDE of these anions is
larger than that of BH4-, which increases with the increase in the number of
peripheral BH4 moieties (x). The hydrogen storage capacity of LiBH4-x(BH4)x
complexes is higher but binding energy is smaller than that of LiBH4, a typical

because the dual function is also bent in certain cases. For $k$ odd and
$\gcd(n, k)=1$, it is known that the Coulter-Matthews bent function
$f(x)=Tr(ax^{\frac{3^k+1}{2}})$ is weakly regular bent over $\mathbb{F}_{3^n}$,
where $a\in\mathbb{F}_{3^n}^{*}$, and
$Tr(\cdot):\mathbb{F}_{3^n}\rightarrow\mathbb{F}_3$ is the trace function. In
this paper, we investigate the dual function of $f(x)$, and dig out an
universal formula. In particular, for two cases, we determine the formula
explicitly: for the case of $n=3t+1$ and $k=2t+1$ with $t\geq 2$, the dual
function is given by
$$Tr\left(-\frac{x^{3^{2t+1}+3^{t+1}+2}}{a^{3^{2t+1}+3^{t+1}+1}}-\frac{x^{3^{2t}+1}}{a^{-3^{2t}+3^{t}+1}}+\frac{x^{2}}{a^{-3^{2t+1}+3^{t+1}+1}}\right);$$
and for the case of $n=3t+2$ and $k=2t+1$ with $t\geq 2$, the dual function is
given by
$$Tr\left(-\frac{x^{3^{2t+2}+1}}{a^{3^{2t+2}-3^{t+1}+3}}-\frac{x^{2\cdot3^{2t+1}+3^{t+1}+1}}{a^{3^{2t+2}+3^{t+1}+1}}+\frac{x^2}{a^{-3^{2t+2}+3^{t+1}+3}}\right).$$
As a byproduct, we find two new classes of ternary bent functions with only
three terms. Moreover, we also prove that in certain cases $f(x)$ is regular
bent.

recorded during the past 24 years. Characteristic magnitudes, colors and
albedos in all seven band-passes are derived from the ensemble of data.
Additionally, 25 spectra spanning 26 hours of observation on 5 nights are
analyzed. The spectrophotometry demonstrates that planetary flux and albedo is
inversely related to the equivalent widths of methane bands. We attribute the
changes in band strength, flux and albedo to the high altitude clouds which
rotate across the planet's visible disk. Bright clouds increase albedo and flux
while reducing methane absorption. Synthetic V magnitudes derived from the
spectroscopy also agree closely with the photometric quantities, which
cross-validates the two techniques. The spectroscopic and photometric results
are discussed within the framework of the secular brightness variations of
Neptune.

the Friedmann equation derives from these in an astoundingly simple way through

gravitational horizon, as a result of which the application of the shell
theorem fails and the Newtonian derivation collapses. We show that in the
presence of a gravitational horizon the Friedmann equation can be derived from
a Machian definition of kinetic energy, without invoking the shell theorem.
Whereas in the Newtonian case total energy translates to curvature energy
density, in the Machian case total energy takes on different identities,
depending on the evolution of the horizon; we show that in the de Sitter
universe Machian total energy density is constant, i.e. appears as cosmological
constant.

Fermi, however, never published anything on this topic. On the one occasion he
is known to have mentioned it, he asked 'where is everybody?'- apparently
suggesting that we don't see extraterrestrials on Earth because interstellar
travel may not be feasible, but not suggesting that intelligent
extraterrestrial life does not exist, or suggesting its absence is paradoxical.
  The claim 'they are not here; therefore they do not exist' was first
published by Michael Hart, claiming that interstellar travel and colonization
of the galaxy would be inevitable if intelligent extraterrestrial life existed,
and taking its absence here as proof that it does not exist anywhere. The Fermi
paradox appears to originate in Hart's argument, not Fermi's question.
  Clarifying the origin of these ideas is important, because the Fermi paradox
is seen by some as an authoritative objection to searching for evidence of
extraterrestrial intelligence-cited in the U. S. Congress as a reason for
killing NASA's SETI program on one occasion-but evidence indicates that it
misrepresents Fermi's views, misappropriates his authority, deprives the actual
