scalar-tensor theory of gravity, called the XG theory, by which the action or
the Hamiltonian and the primary constraints keep their forms invariant. We
derive the Hamiltonian in a non perturbative manner and complete the
Hamiltonian analysis for all regions of the theory. We confirm that the theory
has at most 3 degrees of freedom in all regions of the theory as long as the
theory has the symmetry under the spatial diffeormorphism. Then, we derive the
invariant canonical transformation by using the infinitesimal transformation.
The invariant metric transformation of the XG theory contains a vector product
as well as the disformal transformation. The vector product and the disformal
factor can depend on the higher order derivative terms of the scalar field and
the metric. In addition, we discover the invariant canonical transformation
which transforms the momentum of the metric. Using the invariant
transformation, we study the relation between the Horndeski theory and the GLPV
theory, and find that we can not obtain the arbitrary GLPV theory from the
Horndeski theory through the invariant canonical transformation we have found.

key management systems use either pre-installed shared keys or install initial

additional burden for engineers who manage the devices in industrial plants.
Hence, device deployment in industrial plants becomes a challenging task in
order to achieve security. In this work, we present a device deployment
framework that can support key management using the existing trust towards
employees in a plant. This approach reduces the access to initial security
parameters by employees, rather it helps to bind the trust of the employee with
device commissioning. Thus, this approach presents a unique solution to the
device deployment problem. Further, through a proof-of-concept implementation
and security analysis using the AVISPA tool, we present that our framework is
feasible to implement and satisfies our security objectives.

  We investigate this in the constructive setting. The basic construction is

successful for scalable recommendation systems with extreme sparsity. HPF,

the sparsity model from the response model, allowing us to choose the most
suitable distribution for the response. HCPF can capture binary, non-negative

compare HCPF with HPF on nine discrete and three continuous data sets and
conclude that HCPF captures the relationship between sparsity and response

involved the radio luminosities and X-ray spectral indices of the blazars. We
used a Principal Component Analysis (PCA), to determine the basis vectors of
the blazar SEDs and, in order to maximize the size of the sample, imputed
missing fluxes using the K-nearest neighbors method. Using more than an order
of magnitude more data than was available when Fossati et al. (1997, 1998)
first reported trends of SED shape with blazar luminosity, we confirmed the
anti-correlation between radio luminosity and synchrotron peak frequency,
although with greater scatter than was seen in the smaller sample. The same
trend can be seen between bolometric luminosity and synchrotron peak frequency.
Finally, we used all available blazar data to determine an empirical SED
description that depends only on the radio luminosity at 1.4~GHz and the
redshift. We verified that this statistically significant relation was not a
result of the luminosity-luminosity correlations that are natural in
flux-limited samples (i.e., where the correlation is actually caused by the

collisions. However there are also considerable uncertainties with regard to
the astrophysical ingredients to the predicted WIMP signal. Uncertainties in
the velocity of the Sun with respect to the Milky Way dark matter halo, the
local density of WIMPs, and the shape of the local WIMP speed distribution all
have an effect on the expected event rate in direct detection experiments and
hence will change the region of the WIMP parameter space for which neutrinos
are a significant background. In this work we extend the WIMP+neutrino analysis
to account for the uncertainty in the astrophysics dependence of the WIMP
signal. We show the effect of uncertainties on projected discovery limits with
an emphasis on low WIMP masses (less than 10 GeV) when Solar neutrino
backgrounds are most important. We find that accounting for astrophysical
uncertainties changes the shape of the neutrino floor as a function of WIMP
mass but also causes it to appear at cross sections up to an order of magnitude
larger, extremely close to existing experimental limits - indicating that
neutrino backgrounds will become an issue sooner than previously thought. We
also explore how neutrinos hinder the estimation of WIMP parameters and how
astrophysical uncertainties impact the discrimination of WIMPs and neutrinos

$1/(T_1T)$ reveals a progressive slowing down of spin fluctuations. Yet,
long-range magnetic order and also a detectable orthorhombic lattice distortion
are absent. Thus, we conclude from the data that short-range orbital-nematic
ordering or a slowly fluctuating form of it sets in near 160 K. Remarkably, all
anomalies in the transport and also the indications of slow spin fluctuations
disappear close to optimal doping $x=0.1$ which suggests that in

churches built prior to 1810, as well as a few buildings of later times, nearly

sample indicates that a definite orientation pattern was followed on the island

prototype is twofold. On the one hand, the representative orientation to the
east (or west) is present. However, the sample has also a marked orientation

interactions to flow back to weak coupling. Consistent with this RG scenario,
in unbiased quantum Monte Carlo simulations of the Hubbard model we find
compelling evidence that antiferromagnetism turns on at a finite $U/t$, despite
the $U=0$ hopping problem having a QBT. The onset of antiferromagnetism takes
place at a continuous transition which is consistent with a dynamical critical
exponent $z=1$ as expected for 2+1 d Gross-Neveu criticality. We conclude that
generically in models of bilayer graphene, even if the free dispersion has a

poses and appear reasonably well spaced out in the image. However, in many real
images, that's not what people do. People often appear quite close to each
other, e.g., with limbs linked or heads touching, and their poses are often not
pedestrian-like. We propose an approach to detangle people in multi-person
images. We formulate the task as a region assembly problem. Starting from a
large set of overlapping regions from body part semantic segmentation and
generic object proposals, our optimization approach reassembles those pieces
together into multiple person instances. It enforces that the composed body
part regions of each person instance obey constraints on relative sizes, mutual
spatial relationships, foreground coverage, and exclusive label assignments
when overlapping. Since optimal region assembly is a challenging combinatorial
problem, we present a Lagrangian relaxation method to accelerate the lower
bound estimation, thereby enabling a fast branch and bound solution for the
global optimum. As output, our method produces a pixel-level map indicating
both 1) the body part labels (arm, leg, torso, and head), and 2) which parts
belong to which individual person. Our results on three challenging datasets
show our method is robust to clutter, occlusion, and complex poses. It
outperforms a variety of competing methods, including existing detector CRF

attention models over different databases consisting of distorted images with
various types of distortions such as blur, noise and compression with varying

(~250 pc) extended narrow line region (ENLR) cloud near Centaurus A using the
Multi Unit Spectroscopic Explorer. This cloud is located in the so-called outer
filament of ionized gas (about 15 kpc from the nucleus) where jet-induced star
formation has been suggested to occur by different studies. We find that,
despite the small size, a mixture of ionization mechanisms is operating,
resulting in considerable complexity in the spatial ionization structure. The
area includes two H II regions where star formation is occurring and another
location where star formation must have ceased very recently. Interestingly,
the extreme Balmer decrement of one of the star forming regions
(H_alpha/H_beta~6) indicates that it is still heavily embedded in its natal
cocoon of gas and dust. At all three locations a continuum counterpart is found
with spectra matching those of O/B stars local to Centaurus A. The H II regions
are embedded in a larger gas complex which is photoionized by the radiation of
the central active galactic nucleus (AGN), but the O/B stars affect the spatial
ionization pattern in the ENLR cloud very locally. In particular, in the
surroundings of the youngest star forming region, we can isolate a tight mixing
sequence in the diagnostic diagram going from gas with ionization due to a pure
stellar continuum to gas only photoionized by the AGN. These results emphasize
the complexity and the mixture of processes occurring in star forming regions
under the influence of an AGN radiation. This is relevant for our understanding
of AGN-induced star formation suggested to occur in a number of objects,
including this region of Centaurus A. They also illustrate that these young
stars influence the gas over only a limited region.

nuclear matter. Several different approaches for measuring the masses and radii
of neutron stars have been tried or proposed, including analyzing the X-ray
fluxes and spectra of the emission from neutron stars in quiescent low-mass
X-ray binary systems and thermonuclear burst sources; fitting the
energy-dependent X-ray waveforms of rotation-powered millisecond pulsars, burst
oscillations with millisecond periods, and accretion-powered millisecond
pulsars; and modeling the gravitational radiation waveforms of coalescing
double neutron star and neutron star -- black hole binary systems. We describe
the strengths and weaknesses of these approaches, most of which currently have
substantial systematic errors, and discuss the prospects for decreasing the
systematic errors in each method.

choice of vectors $v_1,\ldots,v_r \in V$ and have a Gaussian shape that peaks
on the locus where $v_1,\ldots,v_r$ become Hodge classes. We show that they can
be rescaled so that one can form theta series by summing over a lattice $L^r

$\Gamma \backslash \mathbb{D}$. We compute their cohomology class explicitly in
terms of the cohomology classes of Hodge loci in $\Gamma \backslash

we show that the components of our forms of appropriate degree recover the
forms introduced by Kudla and Millson. In particular, our results provide
another way to establish the main properties of these forms.

In this work, we first show that the $L^\infty$-boundedness of the system can
be reduced to the boundedness of
$\|u(\cdot,t)\|_{L^{\frac{n}{4}+\epsilon}(\Omega)}$ for some $\epsilon>0$

$L^\infty$-boundedness of the system. Furthermore, we show that boundedness
implies exponential convergence with explicit convergence rate, which resolves

supernovae (SNe Ia) is presented. A metric space built using principal
component analysis (PCA) on spectral series SNe Ia between -12.5 and +17.5 days
from B maximum is used as a set of predictors. This metric space is built to be
insensitive to reddening. Hence, it does not predict the part of color excess
due to dust-extinction. At the same time, the rich variability of SN Ia spectra
is a good predictor of a large fraction of the intrinsic color variability.
Such metric space is a good predictor of the epoch when the maximum in the B-V
color curve is reached. Multivariate Partial Least Square (PLS) regression
predicts the intrinsic B band light-curve and the intrinsic B-V color curve up
to a month after maximum. This allows to study the relation between the light
curves of SNe Ia and their spectra. The total-to-selective extinction ratio RV
in the host-galaxy of SNe Ia is found, on average, to be consistent with
typical Milky-Way values. This analysis shows the importance of collecting
spectra to study SNe Ia, even with large sample publicly available. Future
automated surveys as LSST will provide a large number of light curves. The
analysis shows that observing accompaning spectra for a significative number of
SNe will be important even in the case of ""normal"" SNe Ia.

congestion, but also that we need urgently a better theoretical understanding

sector, the Higgs is expected to be universally in the form of a condensate
towards the end of inflation. The Higgs decays rapidly after inflation - via
non-perturbative effects - into an out-of-equilibrium distribution of SM
species, which thermalize soon afterwards. If the post-inflationary equation of
state of the universe is stiff, $w \simeq +1$, the SM species eventually
dominate the total energy budget. This provides a natural origin for the
relativistic thermal plasma of SM species, required for the onset of the `hot
Big Bang' era. The viability of this scenario requires the inflationary Hubble
scale $H_*$ to be lower than the instability scale for Higgs vacuum decay, the
Higgs not to generate too large curvature perturbations at cosmological scales,
and the SM dominance to occur before Big Bang Nucleosynthesis. We show that
successful reheating into the SM can only be obtained in the presence of a
non-minimal coupling to gravity $\xi \gtrsim 1$, with a reheating temperature

perovskite-based solar cells is one of the fundamental aspects of these cells

hysteresis, is polarization of the perovskite layer under applied voltage and
illumination bias, due to ion migration within the perovskite. To study this
problem systemically current-voltage characteristics of both regular (light
incident through the electron conducting contact) and so-called inverted (light
incident through the hole conducting contact) perovskite cells were studied at
different temperatures and scan rates. We explain our results by assuming that
the effects of scan rate and temperature on hysteresis are strongly correlated
to ion migration within the device, with the rate-determining step being ion
migration at/across the interfaces of the perovskite layer with the contact
materials. By correlating between the scan rate with the measurement
temperature we show that the inverted and regular cells operate in different
hysteresis regimes, with different activation energies of 0.28+-0.04 eV and
0.59+-0.09 eV, respectively. We suggest that the differences, observed between
the two architectures are due to different rates of ion migration close to the
interfaces, and conclude that the diffusion coefficient of migrating ions in
the inverted cells is 3 orders of magnitude higher than in the regular cells,
leading to different accumulation rates of ions near the interfaces. Analysis
of VOC as a function of temperature shows that the main recombination mechanism
is trap-assisted (Shockley-Read Hall, SRH) in the space charge region, similar
to what is the case for other thin film inorganic solar cells.

Fermi sea at the half filled Landau level, Dam T. Son has made an intriguing
proposal [Phys. Rev. X {\bf 5}, 031027 (2015)] that composite fermions are
Dirac particles. We ask what features of the Dirac-composite fermion theory and
its various consequences may be reconciled with the well established
microscopic theory of the fractional quantum Hall effect and the 1/2 state,
which is based on {\em non-relativistic} composite fermions. Starting from the
microscopic theory, we derive the assertion of Son that the particle-hole
transformation of electrons at filling factor $\nu=1/2$ corresponds to an
effective time reversal transformation (i.e.
$\{\vec{k}_j\}$$\rightarrow$$\{-\vec{k}_j\}$) for composite fermions, and
discuss how this connects to the absence of $2k_{\rm F}$ backscattering in the
presence of a particle-hole symmetric disorder. By considering bare holes in
various composite-fermion $\Lambda$ levels (analogs of electronic Landau
levels) we determine the $\Lambda$ level spacing and find it to be very nearly
independent of the $\Lambda$ level index, consistent with a parabolic
dispersion for the underlying composite fermions. Finally, we address the
compatibility of the Chern-Simons theory with the lowest Landau level
constraint, and find that the wave functions of the mean-field Chern-Simons
theory, as well as a class of topologically similar wave functions, are
surprisingly accurate when projected into the lowest Landau level. These
considerations lead us to introduce a ""normal form"" for the unprojected wave
functions of the $n/(2pn-1)$ states that correctly capture the topological
properties even without lowest Landau level projection.

MDP policies depend on both the stochastic system dynamics as well as the
reward function, the solution of the inverse problem is significantly
influenced by both. Current IRL approaches assume that if the transition model
is unknown, additional samples from the system's dynamics are accessible, or
the observed behavior provides enough samples of the system's dynamics to solve
the inverse problem accurately. These assumptions are often not satisfied. To
overcome this, we present a gradient-based IRL approach that simultaneously
estimates the system's dynamics. By solving the combined optimization problem,
our approach takes into account the bias of the demonstrations, which stems
from the generating policy. The evaluation on a synthetic MDP and a transfer
learning task shows improvements regarding the sample efficiency as well as the
accuracy of the estimated reward functions and transition models.

model, we shall consider a stochastic controlled problem with multidimensional
backward SDE dynamics, which covers many existing time-inconsistent problems in

essentially equivalent to the lack of {\it comparison principle}. We shall
propose three approaches aiming at reviving the DPP in this setting: the
duality approach, the dynamic utility approach, and the master equation
approach. Unlike the game approach in many existing works in continuous time
models, all our approaches produce the same value as the original static

for every pair of vertices u,w in G, there exists abpath P_{uw} in G that is
monotone in some direction l_{uw}. (Namely, the order of the orthogonal
projections of the vertices of P_{uw} on l_{uw} is the same as the order they
appear in P_{uw}.)
  The problem of finding monotone drawings for trees has been studied in
several recent papers. The main focus is to reduce the size of the drawing.
Currently, the smallest drawing size is O(n^{1.205}) x O(n^{1.205}). In this
paper, we present an algorithm for constructing monotone drawings of trees on a
grid of size at most 12n x 12n. The smaller drawing size is achieved by a new
simple Path Draw algorithm, and a procedure that carefully assigns primitive
vectors to the paths of the input tree T.
  We also show that there exists a tree T_0 such that any monotone drawing of
T_0 must use a grid of size Omega(n) x Omega(n). So the size of our monotone
drawing of trees is asymptotically optimal.

  We obtain our results by reducing CCA to the top-$k$ generalized eigenvector
problem. We solve this problem through a general framework that simply requires
black box access to an approximate linear system solver. Instantiating this
framework with accelerated gradient descent we obtain a running time of
$O(\frac{z k \sqrt{\kappa}}{\rho} \log(1/\epsilon) \log

their origin is still highly debated. In one of the leading formation
scenarios, a black hole of $\sim100$ M$_{\odot}$ results from the collapse of
the inner core of a supermassive star ($\gtrsim 10^{4-5}$ M$_{\odot}$), created
by the rapid accumulation ($\gtrsim 0.1 $ M$_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$) of pristine
gas at the centre of newly formed galaxies at $z\sim 15$. The subsequent
evolution is still speculative: the remaining gas in the supermassive star can
either directly plunge into the nascent black hole, or part of it can form a
central accretion disc, whose luminosity sustains a surrounding, massive, and
nearly hydrostatic envelope (a system called a ""quasi-star""). To address this
point, we consider the effect of rotation on a quasi-star, as angular momentum
is inevitably transported towards the galactic nucleus by the accumulating gas.
Using a model for the internal redistribution of angular momentum that
qualitative matches results from simulations of rotating convective stellar
envelopes, we show that quasi-stars with an envelope mass greater than a few
$10^{5}$ M$_{\odot} \times (\rm black~hole~mass/100 M_{\odot})^{0.82}$ have
highly sub-keplerian gas motion in their core, preventing gas circularisation
outside the black hole's horizon. Less massive quasi-stars could form but last
for only $\lesssim 10^4$ years before the accretion luminosity unbinds the
envelope, suppressing the black hole growth. We speculate that this might
eventually lead to a dual black hole seed population: (i) massive ($>10^{4}$
M$_{\odot}$) seeds formed in the most massive ($> 10^{8}$ M$_{\odot}$) and rare
haloes; (ii) lighter ($\sim 10^{2}$ M$_{\odot}$) seeds to be found in less
massive and therefore more common haloes.

suggests that the spin axes of quasars preferentially align with their
surrounding large-scale structure that is assumed to be traced by the LQGs.
Here, we consider a large sample of LQGs built from the Sloan Digital Sky
Survey DR7 quasar catalogue in the redshift range $1.0-1.8$. For quasars
embedded in this sample, we collected radio polarization measurements with the
goal to study possible correlations between quasar polarization vectors and the
major axis of their host LQGs. Assuming the radio polarization vector is
perpendicular to the quasar spin axis, we found that the quasar spin axis is
preferentially parallel to the LQG major axis inside LQGs that have at least
$20$ members. This result independently supports the observations at optical
wavelengths. We additionally found that when the richness of an LQG decreases,
the quasar spin axis becomes preferentially perpendicular to the LQG major axis

members.

velocity dispersion does not depend on the stellar mass for most of the mass
range: the curve of the velocity dispersion as a function of mass is nearly
flat even after several half-mass relaxation times, regardless of the adopted
stellar evolution recipes and Galactic tidal field model. This result holds
both if we start from virialized King models and if we use clumpy sub-virial
initial conditions. The velocity dispersion of the most massive stars and
stellar remnants tends to be higher than the velocity dispersion of the lighter

star-forming galaxies at z~1. These spectra are unique in that they cover the
high-ionization CIV{\lambda}{\lambda}1548, 1550 doublet. We also detect
low-ionization features such as SiII{\lambda}1527, FeII{\lambda}1608,
AlII{\lambda}1670, NiII{\lambda}{\lambda}1741, 1751 and SiII{\lambda}1808, and
intermediate-ionization features from AlIII{\lambda}{\lambda}1854, 1862.
Comparing the properties of absorption lines of lower- and higher- ionization
states provides a window into the multi-phase nature of circumgalactic gas. Our
sample is drawn from the DEEP2 survey and spans the redshift range 1.01 < z <
1.35 (<z> = 1.25). By isolating the interstellar CIV absorption from the
stellar P-Cygni wind profile we find that 69% of the CIV profiles are
blueshifted with respect to the systemic velocity. Furthermore, CIV shows a
small but significant blueshift relative to FeII (offset of the best-fit linear
regression -76 $\pm$ 26 km/s). At the same time, the CIV blueshift is on
average comparable to that of MgII{\lambda}{\lambda}2796, 2803. At this point,
in explaining the larger blueshift of CIV absorption at the ~ 3-sigma level, we
cannot distinguish between the faster motion of highly-ionized gas relative to
gas traced by FeII, and filling in on the red side from resonant CIV emission.
We investigate how far-UV interstellar absorption kinematics correlate with
other galaxy properties using stacked spectra. These stacking results show a
direct link between CIV absorption and the current SFR, though we only observe
small velocity differences among different ionization states tracing the
outflowing ISM.

time-reversal-invariant insulators with nonsymmorphic spatial symmetries. These
insulators may be described as 'piecewise topological', in the sense that
subtopologies describe the different high-symmetry submanifolds of the
Brillouin zone, and the various subtopologies must be pieced together to form a
globally consistent topology. The subtopologies that we discovered include: a
glide-symmetric analog of the quantum spin Hall effect, an hourglass-flow
topology (exemplified by our recently-proposed KHgSb material class), and
quantized non-Abelian polarizations. Our cohomological classification results

in graphene, we investigate theoretically the behavior of hydrodynamic sound
modes in such quasi-relativistic fluids near charge neutrality, within linear
response. Locally driving an electron fluid at a resonant frequency to such a
sound mode can lead to large increases in the electrical response at the edges
of the sample, a signature which cannot be explained using diffusive models of
transport. We discuss the robustness of this signal to various effects,
including electron-acoustic phonon coupling, disorder, and long-range Coulomb
interactions. These long range interactions convert the sound mode into a
collective plasmonic mode at low frequencies unless the fluid is charge
neutral. At the smallest frequencies, the response in a disordered fluid is
quantitatively what is predicted by a ""momentum relaxation time"" approximation.
However, this approximation fails at higher frequencies (which can be
parametrically small), where the classical localization of sound waves cannot
be neglected. Experimental observation of such resonances is a clear signature
of relativistic hydrodynamics, and provides an upper bound on the viscosity of
the electron-hole plasma.

distributions of stellar or baryonic mass. Our SMFs exhibit the ""plateau""
feature starting below Mstar ~ 10^10 Msun that has been described in prior
work. However, the BMF fills in this feature and rises as a straight power law
below ~10^10 Msun, as gas-dominated galaxies become the majority of the
population. Nonetheless, the low-mass slope of the BMF is not as steep as that
of the theoretical dark matter halo MF. Moreover, we assign group halo masses
by abundance matching, finding that the SMF and BMF separated into four
physically motivated halo mass regimes reveal complex structure underlying the
simple shape of the overall MFs. In particular, the satellite MFs are depressed
below the central galaxy MF ""humps"" in groups with mass <10^13.5 Msun yet rise
steeply in clusters. Our results suggest that satellite destruction and/or
stripping are active from the point of nascent group formation. We show that

rapidly rotating BHs to shed their spin into a large cloud of axions in atomic
Bohr orbits around the BH, through the effect of superradiance (SR). This
results in a gap in the mass vs. spin distribution of BHs when the BH size is
comparable to the axion's Compton wavelength. By measuring the spin and mass of
the merging objects observed at LIGO, we could verify the presence and shape of
the gap in the BH distribution produced by the axion.

annihilations or level transitions. A blind monochromatic GW search may reveal
up to 10^5 BHs radiating through axion annihilations, at distinct frequencies

observable in future GW observatories. The merger events are perfect candidates

or local realistic models of quantum theory (QT), including quantum field
theory (QFT), are theoretically possible and practically feasible in light of
the present state of these theories. Quantum physicists consider Bells famous
inequality and its violation in experiments to be a strong indication that
local realistic or local causal models of QT are not possible and that quantum
theory as a whole is therefore not a local realistic or local causal theory.
Based on a proposed definition of a ""formal causal model"" for a theory of
physics (such as QT), this paper investigates the possibility of having a local
causal model for QT. Areas of QT are identified in which the construction of a
causal model is impeded because of deficiencies in the state of the respective
theory. It is shown that the removal of the deficiencies can be achieved by the
provision of a causal model. Whereas the construction of a causal model of QT,
including QFT, appears to be feasible after the removal of certain
deficiencies, the construction of a local (causal) model does not appear to be
possible. As a consequence of the conclusion that local (causal) models of
QT/QFT are not possible, if a strong interpretation of locality is assumed, a
locality model is proposed in which the non-localities are confined to ""quantum
objects"".

contributions to the OH Trot as a function of the upper vibrational level v',
we studied a sample of 343 echelle spectra taken with the X-shooter
spectrograph at the Very Large Telescope at Cerro Paranal in Chile. These data
allowed us to analyse 25 OH bands in each spectrum. Moreover, we could measure
lines of O2b(0-1), which peaks at 94 to 95 km, and O2a(0-0) with an emission
peak at about 90 km. Since the radiative lifetimes are relatively long, the
derived O2 Trot are not significantly affected by non-LTE contributions. For a
comparison with OH, the differences in the emission profiles were corrected by
using OH emission, O2a(0-0) emission, and CO2-based temperature profile data
from the multi-channel radiometer SABER on the TIMED satellite. For a reference

$\p_x$ are unique up to a sub-resonance polynomial. As a consequence, we obtain
the centralizer theorem that the coordinate change $\h$ also conjugates any

evaporating gasous globules (EGGs), proplyd-like objects, and condensations.
From the 70 and 160 micron flux maps, we derive the local FUV field on the PDR
surfaces. In parallel, we use a census of the O-stars to estimate the overall
FUV-field, that is 10^3-10^4 G_0 close to the central OB cluster (within 10 pc)
and decreases down to a few tens G_0, in a distance of 50 pc. From a SED fit to
the four longest Herschel wavelengths, we determine column density and
temperature maps and derive masses, volume densities and surface densities for
these structures. We find that the morphological classification corresponds to
distinct physical properties. Pillars and globules have the longest estimated
photoevaporation lifetimes, a few 10^6 yr, while all other features should
survive less than that. These lifetimes are consistent with that found in
simulations of turbulent, UV-illuminated clouds. We propose a tentative
evolutionary scheme in which pillars can evolve into globules, which in turn
then evolve into EGGs, condensations and proplyd-like objects.

that for $\kappa>2$ a new regime of stability for the exact solutions appears

unrelaxed. The influence of shear and extensional deformation and polymer
orientation is determined in a nonlinear elastic limit where dissipative
relaxation processes are intentionally neglected. For needles and PP-level
chains, a Gaussian analysis of transverse polymer dynamical fluctuations
predicts that deformation-induced orientation leads to tube dilation. In
contrast, for deformed polymers in which chain stretch does not relax we find
tube compression. For all three systems, a finite maximum transverse
entanglement force localizing the polymers in effective tubes is predicted. The
conditions when this entanglement force can be overcome (a force imbalance) by
an externally applied force associated with macroscopic deformation can be
crisply defined in the nonlinear elastic limit, and the possibility of a
""microscopic absolute yielding"" event destroying the tube confinement can be
analyzed. For needles and contour-relaxed PP chains, this force imbalance is
found to occur at a stress of order the equilibrium shear modulus and thus a
strain of order unity, corresponding to a mechanically fragile entanglement
tube field. However, for unrelaxed stretched chains, tube compression
stabilizes transverse polymer confinement, and there appears to be no force
imbalance. These results collectively suggest that the crossover from elastic
to irreversible viscous response requires chain retraction to initiate
disentanglement. We qualitatively discuss comparisons with existing
phenomenological models for nonlinear startup shear, step strain, and creep

of heavily entangled rigid rod polymer fluids based on our self-consistent,
force-level theory of anharmonic tube confinement. The approach is simplified
by neglecting stress-assisted transverse barrier hopping, and irreversible
relaxation proceeds solely via deformation-perturbed reptation. This process is
self-consistently coupled to tube dilation and macroscopic rheological
response. We predict that with increasing strain the tube strongly dilates,
entanglements are lost, and reptation speeds up. As a consequence, a stress
overshoot emerges not due to affine over-orientation, but rather to strong
weakening of the entanglement network. Just beyond the stress overshoot the
longest relaxation time is predicted to scale as the inverse shear rate,
corresponding to the emergence of a generic form of convective constraint
release (CCR). Its origin is a stress-induced local force that
self-consistently couples the mesoscopic tube-scale physics with macroscopic
mechanical response. Tube weakening at the overshoot occurs via the same
qualitative mechanism that leads to microscopic absolute yielding in the
nonlinear elastic scenario analyzed in the preceding paper. The stress
overshoot and emergent CCR thus correspond to an elastic-viscous crossover due
to deformation-induced disentanglement, which at long times and high shear
rates results in a quantitatively sensible flow stress plateau and shear
thinning behavior. We suggest that the predicted behavior for needles is
relevant to flexible chain melts at low Rouse Weissenberg numbers if contour
length equilibration is fast. Quantitative predictions for tube dilation in the
steady state flow of chains melts are favorably compared to a recent
simulation.

the correct theory to describe dipole $l$-changing collisions ($nl\rightarrow

Pengelly & Seaton (1964) has, for half-a-century, been considered the
definitive study which ""solved"" the problem. Recent work by Vrinceanu et
al.(2012) recommended the use of rate coefficients from a semi-classical
approximation which are nearly an order of magnitude smaller than those of
Pengelly & Seaton (1964), with the result that significantly higher densities
are needed for the $nl$ populations to come into local thermodynamic
equilibrium.
  Here, we compare predicted H~I emissivities from the two works and find
widespread differences, of up to $\approx 10$%. This far exceeds the 1%
precision required to obtain the primordial He/H abundance ratio from

needed. By using spectroscopy, I participated in TRANSITS, an RV follow-up
program of Kepler Objects of Interest. I determined the parameters of nine host
stars, enabling the characterization of their companions. With the same method,
I participated in two studies which aim at exploring the mass-radius
relationship of low-mass stars and at improving the statistics of star-planet
interactions. I also inspected the behavior of SOPHIE/OHP spectra for
instrumental effects which can affect the measure of the stellar parameters.
From a different perspective, I studied Kepler-117, a multi-planetary system
which presents Transit Timing Variations (TTV). A specific approach was
developed in order to realize a simultaneous fit of transits, RV, and TTV, used
to measure the mass of the lightest planet of the system, which was poorly
constrained by RV alone. Finally, I focused on the impact of stellar activity
in transit photometry and RV. This phenomenon affects the determination of the
planet radius and mass, as well as other key parameters. I implemented two
starspot modeling codes into a Markov Chain Monte Carlo software, and added
spot evolution to one of them. I applied the codes to observations of the Sun,
CoRoT-2, and CoRoT-7. In particular, I carried out an extensive study on the
light curve of CoRoT-2, and explored the effects of the spots on the transit
parameters. The planetary systems studied in this work provide further
constraints on models of planet interior and formation. With the techniques
here developed, they help in the preparation of future exoplanet surveys.

(M5) derived from the Fourier decomposition of the light curves of selected
RRab and RRc stars. The aim in doing this was to bring these parameters into
the homogeneous scales established by our previous work on numerous other
globular clusters, allowing a direct comparison of the horizontal branch
luminosity in clusters with a wide range of metallicities. Our CCD photometry
of the large variable star population of this cluster is used to discuss light
curve peculiarities, like Blazhko modulations, on an individual basis. New
Blazhko variables are reported.
  From the RRab stars we found [Fe/H]$_{\rm UVES} = -1.335 \pm
0.003{\rm(statistical)} \pm 0.110{\rm(systematic)}$, and a distance of $7.6\pm
0.2$ kpc, and from the RRc stars we found [Fe/H]$_{\rm UVES}$ = $-1.39 \pm
0.03{\rm(statistical)} \pm 0.12{\rm(systematic)}$ and a distance of $7.5 \pm
0.3$ kpc. The results for RRab and RRc stars should be considered independent
since they come from different calibrations and zero points. Absolute
magnitudes, radii and masses are also reported for individual RR Lyrae stars.
The distance to the cluster was calculated by alternative methods like the P-L
relation of SX Phe and the luminosity of the stars at the tip of the red giant
branch; we obtained $7.7 \pm 0.4$ and $7.2-7.5$ kpc respectively.
  The distribution of RR Lyrae stars in the instability strip is discussed and
compared with other clusters in connection with the Oosterhoff and horizontal
branch type. The Oosterhoff type II clusters systematically show a RRab-RRc
segregation about the instability strip first-overtone red edge, while the
Oosterhoff type I clusters may or may not display this feature. A group of RR
Lyrae stars is identified in an advanced evolutionary stage, and two of them
are likely binaries with unseen companions.

strongly magnetized, rapidly rotating neutron stars which are often called
magnetars. In this process, rotational energy of the magnetar is radiated via
magnetic dipole radiation and heats the supernova ejecta. However, if magnetars
are highly distorted in their geometric shape, rotational energy is mainly lost
as gravitational wave radiation and thus such magnetars cannot power SLSNe. By
simply comparing electromagnetic and gravitational wave emission timescales, we
constrain upper limits to the ellipticity of magnetars by assuming that they
power the observed SLSNe. We find that their ellipticity typically needs to be
less than about a few 1e-3. This indicates that the toroidal magnetic field
strengths in these magnetars are typically less than a few 1e16 G so that their
distortions remain small. Because light-curve modelling of SLSNe shows that
their dipole magnetic field strengths are of the order of 1e14 G, the ratio of
poloidal to toroidal magnetic field strengths is found to be larger than ~ 0.01
in magnetars powering SLSNe.

CeCo$_{0.85}$Fe$_{0.15}$Si under high magnetic fields (up to 16 Tesla)
measuring different physical properties such as specific heat, magnetization,
electrical resistivity, thermal expansion and magnetostriction.
CeCo$_{0.85}$Fe$_{0.15}$Si becomes antiferromagnetic at $T_N \approx$ 6.7 K.
However, a broad tail (onset at $T_X \approx$ 13 K) in the specific heat
precedes that second order transition. This tail is also observed in the
temperature derivative of the resistivity. However, it is particularly
noticeable in the thermal expansion coefficient where it takes the form of a
large bump centered at $T_X$. A high magnetic field practically washes out that
tail in the resistivity. But surprisingly, the bump in the thermal expansion
becomes a well pronounced peak fully split from the magnetic transition at
$T_N$. Concurrently, the magnetoresistance also switches from negative to
positive just below $T_X$. The magnetostriction is considerable and
irreversible at low temperature ($\frac {\Delta L}{L} \left(16 T\right) \sim$
4$\times$10$^{-4}$ at 2 K) when the magnetic interactions dominate. A broad
jump in the field dependence of the magnetostriction observed at low $T$ may be
the signature of a weak ongoing metamagnetic transition. Taking altogether, the
results indicate the importance of the lattice effects in the development of
the magnetic order in these alloys.

observables in isolated integrable quantum systems after equilibration. Since
then, the GGE has been demonstrated to be a powerful tool to predict the
outcome of the relaxation dynamics of few-body observables in a variety of
integrable models, a process we call generalized thermalization. This review
discusses several fundamental aspects of the GGE and generalized thermalization
in integrable systems. In particular, we focus on questions such as: which
observables equilibrate to the GGE predictions and who should play the role of
the bath; what conserved quantities can be used to construct the GGE; what are
the differences between generalized thermalization in noninteracting systems
and in interacting systems mappable to noninteracting ones; why is it that the
GGE works when traditional ensembles of statistical mechanics fail. Despite a
lot of interest in these questions in recent years, no definite answers have
been given. We review results for the XX model and for the transverse field
Ising model. For the latter model, we also report original results and show
that the GGE describes spin-spin correlations over the entire system. This
makes apparent that there is no need to trace out a part of the system in real
space for equilibration to occur and for the GGE to apply. In the past, a
spectral decomposition of the weights of various statistical ensembles revealed
that generalized eigenstate thermalization occurs in the XX model (hard-core
bosons). Namely, eigenstates of the Hamiltonian with similar distributions of
conserved quantities have similar expectation values of few-spin observables.
Here we show that generalized eigenstate thermalization also occurs in the
transverse field Ising model.

access memory), it is necessary to be able to predict switching (error) rates.
For small elements, this can be done using a single-macrospin theory since the
element will switch quasi-uniformly. Experimental results on switching rates
suggest that elements large enough to be thermally stable switch by some
mechanism with a lower energy barrier. It has been suggested that this
mechanism is local nucleation, but we have also previously reported a global
magnetostatic instability, which is consistent with the lower experimental
energy barriers. In this paper, we try to determine which of these mechanisms
is most important by visualizing the switching in a ""U-NU"" (uniform -
nonuniform) phase diagram. We find that switching trajectories follow the
horizontal U axis (i.e., quasi-uniform precession) until they reach a critical
amplitude, at which the magnetostatic instability grows exponentially and a
domain wall forms at the center, whose motion completes the switching. We have
tried unsuccessfully to induce local nucleation (a domain wall at the edge). We
conclude that the dominant switching mechanism is not edge nucleation, but the
magnetostatic instability.

is also evidence for a fan-shaped outflow, as found in other studies based on
the [OIII] emission lines. Although evidence for gas inflowing along nuclear
spirals has been found in a few barred galaxies, we find no obvious signs of
such features in the inner kiloparsec of NGC 1365. However, the emission lines

sensitive to such inhomogeneities and can be used to constrain the presence of
ultra-large scale structure (ULSS). We numerically evolve nonlinear
inhomogeneities present at the beginning of inflation in full General
Relativity to assess the CMB quadrupole constraint on the amplitude of the
initial fluctuations and the size of the observable universe relative to a
length scale characterizing the ULSS. To obtain a statistically significant
number of simulations, we adopt a toy model in which inhomogeneities are
injected along a preferred direction. We compute the likelihood function for
the CMB quadrupole including both ULSS and the standard quantum fluctuations
produced during inflation. We compute the posterior given the observed CMB
quadrupole, finding that when including gravitational nonlinearities, ULSS
curvature perturbations of order unity are allowed by the data, even on length
scales not too much larger than the size of the observable universe. Our
results illustrate the utility and importance of numerical relativity for
constraining early universe cosmology.

We propose a hybridized kernel smoothing and $\ell^1$-regularized method to

sparsity assumption on the transition matrix, we establish the rate of
convergence of the proposed estimator and show that the convergence rate
depends on the smoothness of the locally stationary VAR processes only through
the smoothness of the transition matrix function. In addition, for our
estimator followed by thresholding, we prove that the false positive rate (type
I error) and false negative rate (type II error) in the pattern recovery can
asymptotically vanish in the presence of weak signals without assuming the
minimum nonzero signal strength condition. Favorable finite sample performances

adder designs which correspond to early output logic. The proposed full adders
are constructed using the delay-insensitive dual-rail code and adhere to the
four-phase return-to-zero handshaking. For an asynchronous ripple carry adder
(RCA) constructed using the proposed early output full adders, the
relative-timing assumption becomes necessary and the inherent advantages of the
relative-timed RCA are: (1) computation with valid inputs, i.e., forward
latency is data-dependent, and (2) computation with spacer inputs involves a
bare minimum constant reverse latency of just one full adder delay, thus
resulting in the optimal cycle time. With respect to different 32-bit RCA
implementations, and in comparison with the optimized strong-indication,
weak-indication, and early output full adder designs, one of the proposed early
output full adders achieves respective reductions in latency by 67.8, 12.3 and
6.1 %, while the other proposed early output full adder achieves corresponding
reductions in area by 32.6, 24.6 and 6.9 %, with practically no power penalty.
Further, the proposed early output full adders based asynchronous RCAs enable
minimum reductions in cycle time by 83.4, 15, and 8.8 % when considering
carry-propagation over the entire RCA width of 32-bits, and maximum reductions
in cycle time by 97.5, 27.4, and 22.4 % for the consideration of a typical
carry chain length of 4 full adder stages, when compared to the least of the
cycle time estimates of various strong-indication, weak-indication, and early
output asynchronous RCAs of similar size. All the asynchronous full adders and

  Weighting",,,,,"cs.IR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Supervised term weighting could improve the performance of text
categorization. A way proven to be effective is to give more weight to terms
with more imbalanced distributions across categories. This paper shows that
supervised term weighting should not just assign large weights to imbalanced
terms, but should also control the trade-off between over-weighting and
under-weighting. Over-weighting, a new concept proposed in this paper, is
caused by the improper handling of singular terms and too large ratios between
term weights. To prevent over-weighting, we present three regularization
techniques: add-one smoothing, sublinear scaling and bias term. Add-one
smoothing is used to handle singular terms. Sublinear scaling and bias term
shrink the ratios between term weights. However, if sublinear functions scale
down term weights too much, or the bias term is too large, under-weighting
would occur and harm the performance. It is therefore critical to balance
between over-weighting and under-weighting. Inspired by this insight, we also
propose a new supervised term weighting scheme, regularized entropy (re). Our
re employs entropy to measure term distribution, and introduces the bias term
to control over-weighting and under-weighting. Empirical evaluations on topical
and sentiment classification datasets indicate that sublinear scaling and bias
term greatly influence the performance of supervised term weighting, and our re
enjoys the best results in comparison with existing schemes.

the model to fit the ZIKV data in Brazil, Colombia, and El Salvador. Based on
the estimated parameter values, we calculated the median and confidence

increases the risk of infection and epidemic size and prolongs the outbreak. In

an inhomogeneaous distribution of emergent liquid on the surface. This result
is applied to asteroid 433 Eros, which has an irregular, elongated, and concave
shape. Two cases are considered 1) we calculate the height of the liquid in the
capillary when the direction of the capillary is perpendicular to the local
surface of the asteroid; 2) we calculate the height of the liquid in the
capillary when the direction of the capillary is parallel to the vector from
the center of mass to the surface position. The projected height in the
capillary on the local surface of the asteroid seems to depend on the assumed
direction of the capillary.

receive information and energy simultaneously via power splitting (PS) from the

weighted sum of the harvested energy at two source nodes subject to quality of
service (QoS) constraints and the relay power constraints. Three well-known and
practical two-way relay strategies are considered, i.e., amplify-and-forward
(AF), bit level XOR based decode-and-forward (DF-XOR) and symbol level
superposition coding based DF (DF-SUP). For each relaying strategy, we
formulate the joint energy transmit beamforming and PS ratios optimization as a
nonconvex quadratically constrained problem. To find a closed-form solution of
the formulated problem, we decouple the primal problem into two subproblems. In
the first problem, we intend to optimize beamforming vector for a given PS
ratio. In the second subproblem, we optimize the PS ratio with a given
beamforming vector. It is worth noting that although the corresponding
subproblem are nonconvex, the optimal solution of each subproblem can still be
found by using certain techniques. We provide numerical results that
demonstrate the advantage of adapting the different relaying strategies and

KL divergence provide sparse models and sparse representation, which describe
the random variation better than a normal distribution and Frobenius norm.
Specially, sparse models provide more concise understanding of the appearance
of attributes over latent components, while sparse representation provides
concise interpretability of the contribution of latent components over
instances. However, minimizing NMF with KL divergence is much more difficult
than minimizing NMF with Frobenius norm; and sparse models, sparse
representation and fast algorithms for large sparse datasets are still

Multiple views containing different types of features can be used for

mapping between different views. In many real-world applications, information
can be gathered from multiple sources, while each source can contain multiple
views, which are more cohesive for learning. The views under the same source

mappings between different sources are usually incomplete and partially
observed, which makes it more difficult to integrate all the views across
different sources. In this paper, we propose MMC (Multi-source Multi-view
Clustering), which is a framework based on collective spectral clustering with
a discrepancy penalty across sources, to tackle these challenges. MMC has
several advantages compared with other existing methods. First, MMC can deal
with incomplete mapping between sources. Second, it considers the disagreements
between sources while treating views in the same source as a cohesive set.
Third, MMC also tries to infer the instance similarities across sources to
enhance the clustering performance. Extensive experiments conducted on

following way: (1) it increases monotonically with star formation rate per unit
area ($\Sigma_{\rm SFR}$), and stellar mass ($M_*$), with the trend being much
stronger with $M_*$, from $\sim$0% at $M_*=10^{10}M_{\odot}$ to about 50% at
$M_*=10^{11}M_\odot$; (2) the fraction is much smaller in face-on systems than
in edge-on systems. It increases with galaxy inclination ($i$) while $i <
60\,^{\circ}$ and is roughly a constant of 25% beyond this range; (3) for the
sources which can be modeled well with two velocity components, blueshifted and
redshifted from the systemic velocity, these is a positive correlation between
the velocity difference of these two components and the stellar mass, with a
slope similar to the Tully-Fisher relation; (4) the two components are very

partially compute $\Upsilon$ of $(n,1)$-cable of the Whitehead double of the
trefoil knot. For this computation of $\Upsilon$, we determine a sufficient
condition for two satellite knots to have identical $\Upsilon$ for any pattern
with nonzero winding number.

  Dataset of Planar Pushing","8 pages, 10 figures","IROS 2016",,,"cs.RO","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","  Pushing is a motion primitive useful to handle objects that are too large,
too heavy, or too cluttered to be grasped. It is at the core of much of robotic
manipulation, in particular when physical interaction is involved. It seems
reasonable then to wish for robots to understand how pushed objects move.
  In reality, however, robots often rely on approximations which yield models
that are computable, but also restricted and inaccurate. Just how close are
those models? How reasonable are the assumptions they are based on? To help
answer these questions, and to get a better experimental understanding of
pushing, we present a comprehensive and high-fidelity dataset of planar pushing
experiments. The dataset contains timestamped poses of a circular pusher and a
pushed object, as well as forces at the interaction.We vary the push
interaction in 6 dimensions: surface material, shape of the pushed object,
contact position, pushing direction, pushing speed, and pushing acceleration.
An industrial robot automates the data capturing along precisely controlled
position-velocity-acceleration trajectories of the pusher, which give dense
samples of positions and forces of uniform quality.
  We finish the paper by characterizing the variability of friction, and
evaluating the most common assumptions and simplifications made by models of
frictional pushing in robotics.

allowing for the correct simulation of melting, while keeping its behavior in

has made significant improvement in recent years. Current state-of-the-art
object detection methods mostly adhere to the framework of regions with
convolutional neural network (R-CNN) and only use local appearance features
inside object bounding boxes. Since these approaches ignore the contextual
information around the object proposals, the outcome of these detectors may
generate a semantically incoherent interpretation of the input image. In this
paper, we propose an ensemble object detection system which incorporates the
local appearance, the contextual information in term of relationships among
objects and the global scene based contextual feature generated by a
convolutional neural network. The system is formulated as a fully connected
conditional random field (CRF) defined on object proposals and the contextual
constraints among object proposals are modeled as edges naturally. Furthermore,
a fast mean field approximation method is utilized to inference in this CRF
model efficiently. The experimental results demonstrate that our approach
achieves a higher mean average precision (mAP) on PASCAL VOC 2007 datasets

the microscopic origin of heavy-fermion-like behavior in the class of
transition-metal compounds, including LiV$_2$O$_4$, Y(Sc)Mn$_2$, and
YMn$_2$Zn$_{20}$. In this review, we demonstrate by our recent study of muon
spin rotation/relaxation that the temperature ($T$) dependence of the
longitudinal spin relaxation rate ($\lambda\equiv 1/T_1$) in these compounds
exhibits a common trend of leveling off to a constant value ($\lambda\sim
const$.) below a characteristic temperature, $T^*$. This is in marked contrast
to the behavior predicted for normal metals from the Korringa relation,
$\lambda\propto T/\nu$, where the spin fluctuation rate ($\nu$) in the Pauli
paramagnetic state is given as a constant, $\nu\simeq 1/[h D(E_F)]$ [with
$D(E_F)$ being the density of states at the Fermi energy]. Thus, the observed
behavior of $\lambda$ implies that the spin fluctuation rate becomes linearly
dependent on temperature, $\nu\propto T$, suggesting that heavy quasiparticles
develop in a manner satisfying $D(E_F)\propto (m^*)^{\sigma}\propto 1/T$ at
lower temperatures ($\sigma$ determined by the electronic dispersion).
Considering that the theory of spin correlation for intersecting Hubbard chains
as a model of pyrochlore lattice predicts $\nu\propto T$, our finding strongly
indicates the crucial role of $t_{2g}$ bands which preserve the one-dimensional
character at low energies due to the geometrical frustration specific to the

encountering very high and very low annual tropical rainfall has increased
significantly in the recent decade (1998-present) as compared to the preceding
warming era (1979-1997). These changes over land and ocean are spatially
coherent and comprise of a rearrangement of very wet regions and a systematic
expansion of dry zones. While the increased likelihood of extremes is
consistent with a higher average temperature during the pause (as compared to
1979-1997), it is important to note that the periods considered are also
characterized by a transition from a relatively warm to cold phase of the El
Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO). To further probe the relation between
contrasting phases of ENSO and extremes in accumulation, a similar comparison
is performed between 1960-1978 (another extended cold phase of ENSO) and the
aforementioned warming era. Though limited by land-only observations, in this
cold-to-warm transition, remarkably, a near-exact reversal of extremes is noted
both statistically and geographically. This is despite the average temperature
being higher in 1979-1997 as compared to 1960-1978. Taken together, we propose
that there is a fundamental mode of natural variability, involving the waxing
and waning of extremes in accumulation of global tropical rainfall with
different phases of ENSO.

including atoms in cavities, electron or nuclear spins in NV centers in
diamond, erbium in Y$_2$SiO$_5$, bismuth impurities in silicon, or arrays of

potentially more macroscopic than other systems that have been used so far for
testing the Leggett--Garg inequality, and open a route toward probing the
boundaries of quantum mechanics at macroscopic scales. We find that, because of
the non-trivial internal structure of such an ensemble, the behavior of
different measurement schemes, under the influence of noise, can be surprising.
We discuss which measurement schemes are optimal for flux qubits and NV
centers, and some of the technological constraints and difficulties for
observing such violations with present-day experiments.

shape obtained by the MAGIC telescope with a three-Gaussian template and
rescale it to account for the different CTA instrumental and observational
configurations. Simulations are performed for different configurations of CTA
and for the ASTRI mini-array. The northern CTA configuration will provide an
improvement of a factor of ~3 in accuracy with an observing time comparable to
that of MAGIC (73 hours). Unless the VHE spectrum above 1 TeV behaves
differently from what we presently know, unreasonably long observing times are
required for a significant detection of the pulsations of the Crab pulsar with
the high-energy-range sub-arrays. We also found that an independent VHE timing
analysis is feasible with Large Size Telescopes (LSTs). CTA will provide a
significant improvement in determining the VHE pulse shape parameters necessary

unconventional aspect of the NLTVA is that the mathematical form of its
restoring force is not imposed a priori, as it is the case for most existing
nonlinear absorbers. The NLTVA parameters are determined analytically using
stability and bifurcation analyses, and the resulting design is validated using
numerical continuation. The proposed developments are illustrated using a Van

studying creative systems. Few academic studies analysing the behaviour of
creative agents from a theoretical viewpoint have been proposed. The proposed
frameworks are vague and hard to exploit; moreover, such works are focused on a
notion of creativity tailored for humans.
  In this paper we introduce General Creativity, which extends that traditional
notion. General Creativity provides the basis for a formalised theoretical
framework, that allows one to univocally describe any creative agent, and their
behaviour within societies of creative systems. Given the growing number of AI
creative systems developed over recent years, it is of fundamental importance
to understand how they could influence each other as well as how to gauge their
impact on human society. In particular, in this paper we exploit the proposed
framework for (i) identifying different forms of creativity; (ii) describing
some typical creative agents behaviour, and (iii) analysing the dynamics of
societies in which both human and non-human creative systems coexist.

Vibrational motions are well understood in terms of phonons, which carry heat
and control heat transport. The situation is notably different in disordered
solids, where vibrational excitations are not phonons and can be even
localized. Recent numerical work has established the concept of elastic
heterogeneity: disordered solids show inhomogeneous local mechanical response.
Clearly, the heterogeneous nature of elastic properties strongly influences
vibrational and thermal properties, and it is expected to be the origin of
anomalous features, including boson peak, vibrational localization, and
temperature dependence of thermal conductivity. These are all crucial
long-standing problems in materials physics, which we address in the present
work. We have considered a toy model able to stabilize different states of
matter, by introducing an increasing amount of size disorder. The phase diagram
generated by molecular dynamics simulations encompasses the perfect crystalline
state with a spatially homogeneous elastic moduli distribution, multiple
defective phases with increasing moduli heterogeneities, and eventually a
series of amorphous states. We have established clear correlations among the
heterogeneous local mechanical response, vibrational states, and thermal

preprocessing algorithms. Our framework builds on the notion of kernelization
from parameterized complexity. However, as opposed to the original notion of
kernelization, our definitions combine well with approximation algorithms and
heuristics. The key new definition is that of a polynomial size
$\alpha$-approximate kernel. Loosely speaking, a polynomial size
$\alpha$-approximate kernel is a polynomial time pre-processing algorithm that
takes as input an instance $(I,k)$ to a parameterized problem, and outputs
another instance $(I',k')$ to the same problem, such that $|I'|+k' \leq
k^{O(1)}$. Additionally, for every $c \geq 1$, a $c$-approximate solution $s'$
to the pre-processed instance $(I',k')$ can be turned in polynomial time into a
$(c \cdot \alpha)$-approximate solution $s$ to the original instance $(I,k)$.
  Our main technical contribution are $\alpha$-approximate kernels of
polynomial size for three problems, namely Connected Vertex Cover, Disjoint
Cycle Packing and Disjoint Factors. These problems are known not to admit any
polynomial size kernels unless $NP \subseteq coNP/poly$. Our approximate
kernels simultaneously beat both the lower bounds on the (normal) kernel size,
and the hardness of approximation lower bounds for all three problems. On the
negative side we prove that Longest Path parameterized by the length of the
path and Set Cover parameterized by the universe size do not admit even an
$\alpha$-approximate kernel of polynomial size, for any $\alpha \geq 1$, unless
$NP \subseteq coNP/poly$. In order to prove this lower bound we need to combine
in a non-trivial way the techniques used for showing kernelization lower bounds

distributions consistent with observations can only be reproduced if the actual
Type I migration timescale is at least an order of magnitude longer than that
deduced from linear theories. Although past studies considered the effect of
the Type I migration of protoplanetary embryos, in most cases they used a
conventional formula based on static torques in isothermal disks, and employed
a reduction factor to account for uncertainty in the mechanism details.
However, in addition to static torques, a migrating planet experiences dynamic
torques that are proportional to the migration rate. These dynamic torques can
impact on planet migration and predicted planetary populations. In this study,
we derived a new torque formula for Type I migration by taking into account
dynamic corrections. This formula was used to perform population synthesis
simulations with and without the effect of dynamic torques. In many cases,
inward migration was slowed significantly by the dynamic effects. For the
static torque case, gas giant formation was effectively suppressed by Type I
migration; however, when dynamic effects were considered, a substantial
fraction of cores survived and grew into gas giants.

elements diffusion over the solar surface is still a challenge. Understanding
the formation and evolution of the solar network (NE) is a challenge, because
it provides a magnetic flux over the solar surface comparable to the flux of
active regions at solar maximum. Aims: We investigate the structure and
evolution of interior cells of solar supergranulation. From Hinode
observations, we explore the motions on solar surface at high spatial and
temporal resolution. We derive the main organization of the flows inside
supergranules and their effect on the magnetic elements. Method: To probe the
superganule interior cell, we used the Trees of Fragmenting Granules (TFG)
evolution and their relations to horizontal Results: Evolution of TFG and their
mutual interactions result in cumulative effects able to build horizontal
coherent flows with longer lifetime than granulation (1 to 2 hours) over a
scale up to 12\arcsec. These flows clearly act on the diffusion of the
intranetwork (IN) magnetic elements and also on the location and shape of the
network. Conclusions: From our analysis during 24 hours, TFG appear as one of
the major elements of the supergranules which diffuse and advect the magnetic
field on the Sun's surface. The strongest supergranules contribute the most to
magnetic flux diffusion in the solar photosphere.

computationally wasteful in that they consider every part of the input when

ability to reconstruct the full-detail images from the foveated versions. By
varying the type of foveation, we can study how well the architectures can cope
with various types of distortion. We find that the autoencoder compensates for
lower detail by learning increasingly global feature functions. In many cases,
the learnt features are suitable for reconstructing the original full-detail

contains 41 members ($z=0.01\sim 0.54$), which are selected from the Chandra
archive when a high photon count, an adequate angular resolution, a relatively
complete detector coverage, and coincident CC-NCC classifications derived with
three traditional diagnostics are simultaneously guaranteed. We find that in
the log-log space the derived image power spectra can be well represented by a
constant model component at large wavenumbers, while at small wavenumbers a
power excess beyond the constant component appears in all clusters, with a
clear tendency that the excess is stronger in CC clusters. By introducing a new
CC diagnostic parameter, i.e., the power excess index (PEI), we classify the
clusters in our sample and compare the results with those obtained with three
traditional CC diagnostics. We find that the results agree with each other very
well. By calculating the PEI values of the simulated clusters, we find that the
new diagnostic works well at redshifts up to 0.5 for intermediately sized and
massive clusters with a typical Chandra or XMM pointing observation. The new CC
diagnostic has several advantages over its counterparts, e.g., it is free of
the effects of the commonly seen centroid shift of the X-ray halo caused by
merger event, and the corresponding calculation is straightforward, almost
irrelevant to the complicated spectral analysis.

complex, undulating tissue surface in order to enhance the effective
field-of-view through video mosaicing. In this paper, the da Vinci surgical
robot, through the dVRK framework, is used for autonomous scanning and 2D
mosaicing over a user-defined region of interest. To achieve the level of
precision required for high quality large-area mosaic generation, which relies
on sufficient overlap between consecutive image frames, visual servoing is
performed using a tracking marker attached to the probe. The resulting
sub-millimetre accuracy of the probe motion allows for the generation of large
endomicroscopy mo- saics with minimal intervention from the surgeon. It also
allows the probe to be maintained in an orientation perpendicular to the local
tissue surface, providing optimal imaging results. Images are streamed from the
endomicroscope and overlaid live onto the surgeons view, while 2D mosaics are
generated in real-time, and fused into a 3D stereo reconstruction of the
surgical scene, thus providing intuitive visualisation and fusion of the
multi-scale images. The system therefore offers significant potential to
enhance surgical procedures, by providing the operator with cellular-scale

Conventionally, visual representations adopted in visual tracking rely on

generically without considering tracking-specific information. In this paper,
we propose to learn complex-valued invariant representations from tracked
sequential image patches, via strong temporal slowness constraint and stacked
convolutional autoencoders. The deep slow local representations are learned
offline on unlabeled data and transferred to the observational model of our
proposed tracker. The proposed observational model retains old training samples
to alleviate drift, and collect negative samples which are coherent with
target's motion pattern for better discriminative tracking. With the learned
representation and online training samples, a logistic regression classifier is
adopted to distinguish target from background, and retrained online to adapt to
appearance changes. Subsequently, the observational model is integrated into a
particle filter framework to peform visual tracking. Experimental results on
various challenging benchmark sequences demonstrate that the proposed tracker
performs favourably against several state-of-the-art trackers.

from forwards-in-time models of allele frequency evolution with those of
backwards-in-time genealogical models; a well known example is the duality
between the Wright-Fisher diffusion for genetic drift and its genealogical
counterpart, the coalescent. There have been a number of articles extending
this relationship to include other evolutionary processes such as mutation and
selection, but little has been explored for models also incorporating crossover
recombination. Here, we derive from first principles a new genealogical process
which is dual to a Wright-Fisher diffusion model of drift, mutation, and
recombination. Our approach is based on expressing a putative duality
relationship between two models via their infinitesimal generators, and then
seeking an appropriate test function to ensure the validity of the duality
equation. This approach is quite general, and we use it to find dualities for
several important variants, including both a discrete L-locus model of a gene
and a continuous model in which mutation and recombination events are scattered
along the gene according to continuous distributions. As an application of our
results, we derive a series expansion for the transition function of the
diffusion. Finally, we study in further detail the case in which mutation is
absent. Then the dual process describes the dispersal of ancestral genetic
material across the ancestors of a sample. The stationary distribution of this
process is of particular interest; we show how duality relates this
distribution to haplotype fixation probabilities. We develop an efficient
method for computing such probabilities in multilocus models.

incorporate renewables and distributed energy resources (DERs) to the grid.
Because of the associated uncertainties in power generations and peak power

grid lie in the design of an efficient, yet pragmatic distributed control
framework with guaranteed robustness margins. This paper addresses the problem
of output voltage regulation for multiple DC-DC converters connected to a grid,
and prescribes a robust scheme for sharing power among different sources. More
precisely, we develop a control architecture where, unlike most standard
control frameworks, the desired power ratios appear as reference signals to
individual converter systems, and not as internal parameters of the system of
parallel converters. This makes the proposed approach suited for scenarios when
the desired power ratios vary rapidly with time. Additionally, the proposed
control framework is suitable to both centralized and decentralized
implementations, i.e., the same control architecture can be employed for
voltage regulation irrespective of the availability of common load-current (or
power) measurement, without the need to modify controller parameters. The
control design is obtained using robust optimal-control framework. Case studies
presented show the enhanced performance of prescribed optimal controllers for
voltage regulation and power sharing.

infimum of entropy production of a motor can be related to the maximal

diffusion of a test particle is studied using kinetic Monte Carlo simulations.
Diffusion is relevant to a wide variety of problems, both within physics and
outside of physics. Kinetic effects in diffusion are often hidden in a
thermodynamical description of the problem. In this work, no assumptions based
on energy are made, and diffusion occurs purely based on the attempt rate of
the test particle and the occupation and fluctuation rate of the lattice.
Although the average transition rate of the particle is the same for a static
or fluctuating lattice with specific occupation, the diffusion constant is
kinetically affected in a fluctuating, disordered lattice. If the lattice
fluctuates faster than the attempt rate of the particle, diffusion is
controlled by the attempt rate of the particle. However, if the lattice
fluctuates slower than the attempt rate of the particle, diffusion is affected
by the fluctuations. The slower the lattice fluctuates, the lower the diffusion
constant. Furthermore, it is found that for fast fluctuating lattices,
diffusion is due to Brownian motion. If the lattice fluctuates slower than the
particle, diffusion becomes anomalous depending on the occupation of the
lattice.

we quantify the interference correlation in non-Poisson networks where the
interferers are distributed as a Matern cluster process (MCP) and a
second-order cluster process (SOCP). Interestingly, it is found that the
correlation coefficient of interference for the Matern cluster networks,
$\zeta_{MCP}$, is equal to that for second-order cluster networks,

including an extra, nonminimally coupled scalar degree of freedom. A wide class
of these theories, albeit indistinguishable from GR in the weak field regime,
predicts a radically different phenomenology for neutron stars, due to a
nonperturbative, strong-field effect referred to as spontaneous scalarization.
This effect is known to occur in theories where the effective linear coupling
$\beta_0$ between the scalar and matter fields is sufficiently negative, i.e.
$\beta_0 \lesssim -4.35$, and has been strongly constrained by pulsar timing
observations.
  In the test-field approximation, spontaneous scalarization manifests itself
as a tachyonic-like instability. Recently, it was argued that, in theories
where $\beta_0>0$, a similar instability would be triggered by sufficiently
compact neutron stars obeying realistic equations of state. In this work we
investigate the endstate of this instability for some representative coupling
functions with $\beta_0>0$. This is done both through an energy balance
analysis of the existing equilibrium configurations, and by numerically
determining the nonlinear Cauchy development of unstable initial data. We find
that, contrary to the $\beta_0<0$ case, the final state of the instability is
highly sensitive to the details of the coupling function, varying from
gravitational collapse to spontaneous scalarization. In particular, we show,
for the first time, that spontaneous scalarization can happen in theories with
$\beta_0>0$, which could give rise to novel astrophysical tests of the theory
of gravity.

guarantees the presence of a parametrically-unstable chiral edge mode in a

show that one can exploit this to realize a topologically protected,

protected both against internal losses and back-scattering; the latter feature
is in stark contrast to standard travelling wave amplifiers. This adds a new
example to the list of potential quantum devices that profit from topological

individuals behave independently according to a Markov chain, but individual
sample paths cannot be observed due to limitations of the observation process

number of individuals in each state at each time step are available. When these
counts are exact, a conditional least squares (CLS) estimator is known to be
consistent and asymptotically normal. We initiate the study of method of
moments estimators for this problem to handle the more realistic case when
observations are additionally corrupted by noise. We show that CLS can be
interpreted as a simple ""plug-in"" method of moments estimator. However, when

it leads to the emergence of an effective cosmological constant in Einstein's

applications in practice. Scalable SimRank computation has been the subject of
extensive research for more than a decade, and yet, none of the existing
solutions can efficiently derive SimRank scores on large graphs with provable
accuracy guarantees. In particular, the state-of-the-art solution requires up
to a few seconds to compute a SimRank score in million-node graphs, and does
not offer any worst-case assurance in terms of the query error.
  This paper presents SLING, an efficient index structure for SimRank
computation. SLING guarantees that each SimRank score returned has at most
$\varepsilon$ additive error, and it answers any single-pair and single-source
SimRank queries in $O(1/\varepsilon)$ and $O(n/\varepsilon)$ time,
respectively. These time complexities are near-optimal, and are significantly
better than the asymptotic bounds of the most recent approach. Furthermore,
SLING requires only $O(n/\varepsilon)$ space (which is also near-optimal in an
asymptotic sense) and $O(m/\varepsilon + n\log \frac{n}{\delta}/\varepsilon^2)$
pre-computation time, where $\delta$ is the failure probability of the
preprocessing algorithm. We experimentally evaluate SLING with a variety of
real-world graphs with up to several millions of nodes. Our results demonstrate
that SLING is up to $10000$ times (resp. $110$ times) faster than competing
methods for single-pair (resp. single-source) SimRank queries, at the cost of
higher space overheads.

that some active region areas which produce the continuum emission correspond
rather to plages than to the flare kernels. We showed that in some cases the

relaxations. We propose an algorithm to compute a variational approximation of
the pseudo-posterior. Thanks to the convex relaxation, the corresponding

the quasar is at a minimum flux level and broad absorption line profiles are
revealed in the soft X-ray band, with typical velocity widths of $\sigma_{\rm

observations (OBS. C and D, respectively), a very broad absorption trough is
also present above 1 keV. From fitting the absorption lines with models of
photoionized absorption spectra, the inferred outflow velocities lie in the
range $\sim 0.1-0.2c$. The absorption lines likely originate from He and H-like
neon and L-shell iron at these energies. Comparison with earlier archival data
of PDS 456 also reveals similar absorption structure near 1 keV in a 40 ks
observation in 2001, and generally the absorption lines appear most apparent
when the spectrum is more absorbed overall. The presence of the soft X-ray
broad absorption lines is also independently confirmed from an analysis of the
XMM-Newton EPIC spectra below 2 keV. We suggest that the soft X-ray absorption
profiles could be associated with a lower ionization and possibly clumpy phase
of the accretion disk wind, where the latter is known to be present in this
quasar from its well studied iron K absorption profile and where the wind
velocity reaches a typical value of 0.3$c$.

Name-passing process calculi, like the pi-calculus, are a well-known and widely

designed to naturally express processes with a changing link infrastructure, as
the communication between processes may carry information that can be used for

strategies (EPFES) as an efficient approach for nonlinear system
identification. The EPFES is derived from the frequently-employed state-space
model, where the relevant information of the nonlinear system is captured by an
unknown state vector. Similar to classical particle filtering, the EPFES
consists of a set of particles and respective weights which represent different
realizations of the latent state vector and their likelihood of being the
solution of the optimization problem. As main innovation, the EPFES includes an
evolutionary elitist-particle selection which combines long-term information
with instantaneous sampling from an approximated continuous posterior
distribution. In this article, we propose two advancements of the
previously-published elitist-particle selection process. Further, the EPFES is
shown to be a generalization of the widely-used Gaussian particle filter and
thus evaluated with respect to the latter for two completely different
scenarios: First, we consider the so-called univariate nonstationary growth
model with time-variant latent state variable, where the evolutionary selection
of elitist particles is evaluated for non-recursively calculated particle
weights. Second, the problem of nonlinear acoustic echo cancellation is
addressed in a simulated scenario with speech as input signal: By using
long-term fitness measures, we highlight the efficacy of the well-generalizing
EPFES in estimating the nonlinear system even for large search spaces. Finally,
we illustrate similarities between the EPFES and evolutionary algorithms to
outline future improvements by fusing the achievements of both fields of
research.

the limit of neutrino-induced background. We propose here the use of a detector
based on nuclear emulsions to measure the direction of WIMP-induced nuclear
recoils. The production of nuclear emulsion films with nanometric grains is
established. Several measurement campaigns have demonstrated the capability of
detecting sub-micrometric tracks left by low energy ions in such emulsion
films. Innovative analysis technologies with fully automated optical
microscopes have made it possible to achieve the track reconstruction for path
lengths down to one hundred nanometers and there are good prospects to further

character of alternant polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) using
thermally-assisted-occupation density functional theory (TAO-DFT), an efficient
electronic structure method for the study of large ground-state systems with
strong static correlation effects. Our results reveal that the studies of
Kekule and non-Kekule structures qualitatively describe the radical character
of alternant PAHs, which could be useful when electronic structure calculations
are infeasible due to the expensive computational cost. In addition, our
results support previous findings on the increase in radical character with
increasing system size. For alternant PAHs with the same number of aromatic
rings, the geometrical arrangements of aromatic rings are responsible for their
radical character.

modeling assumptions and parameter estimation. In high dimensions, this
modeling is particularly difficult due to the ""curse of dimensionality"". In
this paper, we propose a method for building an intrinsic representation of
such signals in a purely data-driven manner. First, we apply a manifold
learning technique, diffusion maps, to learn the intrinsic model of the latent
variables of the dynamical system, solely from the measurements. Second, we use
concepts and tools from control theory and build a linear contracting observer
to estimate the latent variables in a sequential manner from new incoming
measurements. The effectiveness of the presented framework is demonstrated by
applying it to a toy problem and to a music analysis application. In these
examples we show that our method reveals the intrinsic variables of the
analyzed dynamical systems.

gravitational theories from the flat space into the complex octonion curved

terminology to describe the electromagnetic theory. It inspires subsequent
scholars to study the electromagnetic and gravitational theories with the
complex quaternions/octonions. Furthermore Einstein was the first to depict the
gravitational theory by means of tensor analysis and curved four-space-time.
Nowadays some scholars investigate the electromagnetic and gravitational
properties making use of the complex quaternion/octonion curved space. From the
orthogonality of two complex quaternions, it is possible to define the
covariant derivative of the complex quaternion curved space, describing the
gravitational properties in the complex quaternion curved space. Further it is
possible to define the covariant derivative of the complex octonion curved
space by means of the orthogonality of two complex octonions, depicting
simultaneously the electromagnetic and gravitational properties in the complex
octonion curved space. The result reveals that the connection coefficient and
curvature of the complex octonion curved space will exert an influence on the
field strength and field source of the electromagnetic and gravitational
fields, impacting the linear momentum, angular momentum, torque, energy, and

different forms of phase space distributions not restricted to the
Gibbs-Boltzmann factor. With a generalised Lorentzian both the Kappa-Bose and
Kappa-Fermi partition functions are obtained in straightforward way, from which
the conventional Bose and Fermi distributions follow for $\kappa\to\infty$. For
$\kappa\neq\infty$ these are subject to the restrictions that they can be used
only at temperatures far from zero. They thus, as shown earlier, have little
value for quantum physics. This is reasonable, because physical
$\kappa$-systems imply strong correlations which are absent at zero temperature
where appart from stochastics all dynamical interactions are frozen. In the
classical large temperature limit one obtains physically reasonable
$\kappa$-distributions which depend on energy respectively momentum as well as
on chemical potential. Looking for other functional dependencies, we examine
Bessel functions whether they can be used for obtaining valid distributions.
Again and for the same reason, no Fermi and Bose distributions exist in the low
temperature limit. However, a classical Bessel-Boltzmann distribution can be
constructed which is a Bessel-modified Lorentzian distribution. Whether it
makes any physical sense remains an open question. This is not investigated
here. The choice of Bessel functions is motivated solely by their convergence
properties and not by reference to any physical demands. This result suggests
that the Gibbs-Boltzmann partition function is fundamental not only to
Gibbs-Boltzmann but also to a large class of generalised Lorentzian
distributions as well as to the corresponding nonextensive statistical
mechanics.

is explained by the topology of the Hopf fibration, which defines the geometry
and structure of KS space. A trajectory in Cartesian space is represented by a
four-dimensional manifold, called the fundamental manifold. Based on geometric
and topological aspects classical concepts of stability are translated to KS
language. The separation between manifolds of solutions generalizes the concept
of Lyapunov stability. The dimension-raising nature of the fibration transforms
fixed points, limit cycles, attractive sets, and Poincar\'e sections to
higher-dimensional subspaces. From these concepts chaotic systems are studied.
In strongly perturbed problems the numerical error can break the topological
structure of KS space: points in a fiber are no longer transformed to the same
point in Cartesian space. An observer in three dimensions will see orbits
departing from the same initial conditions but diverging in time. This apparent
randomness of the integration can only be understood in four dimensions. The
concept of topological stability results in a simple method for estimating the
time scale in which numerical simulations can be trusted. Ideally all
trajectories departing from the same fiber should be KS transformed to a unique
trajectory in three-dimensional space, because the fundamental manifold that
they constitute is unique. By monitoring how trajectories departing from one
fiber separate from the fundamental manifold a critical time, equivalent to the
Lyapunov time, is estimated. These concepts are tested on N-body examples: the
Pythagorean problem, and an example of field stars interacting with a binary.

to increase the number of residues in a wrapped-phase map, which only uses a
simple multiply operation in spatial domain to realize frequency shift by
taking advantage of the frequency shift property of Fourier transform. Besides
that, we discuss the relationship between the number of residues and frequency
shift. Finally, the experimental evaluation is conducted to prove the validity
of the proposed method. Experimental results demonstrated that the proposed

optimal. In addition, Gdeisat's method will take much time to make the Fourier

In view of the above problems, we proposed an improved method for phase wraps
elimination or reduction. First, the wrapped phase map is padded with zeros,
the carrier frequency of the projected fringe is determined by high resolution,
which can be used as the moving distance of the spectrum. And then realize
frequency shift in spatial domain. So it not only can enable the spectrum to be
shifted by a rational number when the carrier frequency is not an integer
