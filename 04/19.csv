model to smooth multiple functional data with the assumptions of the same
underlying Gaussian process distribution, a Gaussian process prior for the mean
function, and an Inverse-Wishart process prior for the covariance function.
This model-based approach can borrow strength from all functional data to
increase the smoothing accuracy, as well as estimate the mean-covariance
functions simultaneously. An option of approximating the Bayesian inference
process using cubic B-spline basis functions is integrated in BFDA, which
allows for efficiently dealing with high-dimensional functional data. Examples
of using BFDA in various scenarios and conducting follow-up functional
regression are provided. The advantages of BFDA include: (1) Simultaneously
smooths multiple functional data and estimates the mean-covariance functions in
a nonparametric way; (2) flexibly deals with sparse and high-dimensional
functional data with stationary and nonstationary covariance functions, and
without the requirement of common observation grids; (3) provides accurately
smoothed functional data for follow-up analysis.

facilitating large scale image management and retrieval. Existing methods focus
on learning image-tag correlation or correlation between tags to improve
annotation accuracy. However, most of these methods evaluate their performance
using top-k retrieval performance, where k is fixed. Although such setting
gives convenience for comparing different methods, it is not the natural way
that humans annotate images. The number of annotated tags should depend on
image contents. Inspired by the recent progress in machine translation and
image captioning, we propose a novel Recurrent Image Annotator (RIA) model that
forms image annotation task as a sequence generation problem so that RIA can
natively predict the proper length of tags according to image contents. We
evaluate the proposed model on various image annotation datasets. In addition
to comparing our model with existing methods using the conventional top-k
evaluation measures, we also provide our model as a high quality baseline for
the arbitrary length image tagging task. Moreover, the results of our
experiments show that the order of tags in training phase has a great impact on
the final annotation performance.

learning community. They map measures $\mu$ from some set $M$ to functions in a
reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS) with kernel $k$. The RKHS distance of
two mapped measures is a semi-metric $d_k$ over $M$. We study three questions.
(I) For a given kernel, what sets $M$ can be embedded? (II) When is the
embedding injective over $M$ (in which case $d_k$ is a metric)? (III) How does
the $d_k$-induced topology compare to other topologies on $M$? The existing
machine learning literature has addressed these questions in cases where $M$ is
(a subset of) the finite regular Borel measures. We unify, improve and
generalise those results. Our approach naturally leads to continuous and
possibly even injective embeddings of (Schwartz-) distributions, i.e.,
generalised measures, but the reader is free to focus on measures only. In
particular, we systemise and extend various (partly known) equivalences between
different notions of universal, characteristic and strictly positive definite
kernels, and show that on an underlying locally compact Hausdorff space, $d_k$
metrises the weak convergence of probability measures if and only if $k$ is

generalized low-density parity-check (CH-GLDPC) codes which are free of small
trapping sets. The approach is based on converting some selected check nodes
involving a trapping set into super checks corresponding to a 2-error
correcting component code. Specifically, we follow two main purposes to
construct the check-hybrid codes; first, based on the knowledge of the trapping
sets of the global LDPC code, single parity checks are replaced by super checks
to disable the trapping sets. We show that by converting specified single check
nodes, denoted as critical checks, to super checks in a trapping set, the
parallel bit flipping (PBF) decoder corrects the errors on a trapping set and
hence eliminates the trapping set. The second purpose is to minimize the rate
loss caused by replacing the super checks through finding the minimum number of
such critical checks. We also present an algorithm to find critical checks in a
trapping set of column-weight 3 LDPC code and then provide upper bounds on the
minimum number of such critical checks such that the decoder corrects all error
patterns on elementary trapping sets. Moreover, we provide a fixed set for a
class of constructed check-hybrid codes. The guaranteed error correction
capability of the CH-GLDPC codes is also studied. We show that a CH-GLDPC code
in which each variable node is connected to 2 super checks corresponding to a
2-error correcting component code corrects up to 5 errors. The results are also
extended to column-weight 4 LDPC codes. Finally, we investigate the eliminating
of trapping sets of a column-weight 3 LDPC code using the Gallager B decoding
algorithm and generalize the results obtained for the PBF for the Gallager B
decoding algorithm.

  A Machine Learning Approach","Updated contents to reflect most recent data and corrected typos",,,,"stat.ML stat.AP","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In this paper, we employ machine learning techniques to analyze seventeen
seasons (1999-2000 to 2015-2016) of NBA regular season data from every team to
determine the common characteristics among NBA playoff teams. Each team was
characterized by 26 predictor variables and one binary response variable taking
on a value of ""TRUE"" if a team had made the playoffs, and value of ""FALSE"" if a
team had missed the playoffs. After fitting an initial classification tree to
this problem, this tree was then pruned which decreased the test error rate.
Further to this, a random forest of classification trees was grown which
provided a very accurate model from which a variable importance plot was
generated to determine which predictor variables had the greatest influence on
the response variable. The result of this work was the conclusion that the most
important factors in characterizing a team's playoff eligibility are a team's
opponent number of assists per game, a team's opponent number of made two point
shots per game, and a team's number of steals per game. This seems to suggest
that defensive factors as opposed to offensive factors are the most important
characteristics shared among NBA playoff teams. We then use neural networks to
classify championship teams based on regular season data. From this, we show
that the most important factor in a team not winning a championship is that
team's opponent number of made three-point shots per game. This once again
implies that defensive characteristics are of great importance in not only
determining a team's playoff eligibility, but certainly, one can conclude that
a lack of perimeter defense negatively impacts a team's championship chances in
a given season. Further, it is shown that made two-point shots and defensive
rebounding are by far the most important factor in a team's chances at winning
a championship in a given season.

(KS). The defining feature of these and other OR models is the matching of
directions and planes in the parent face-centred cubic $\gamma$-phase to ones
in the product body-centred cubic/tetragonal $\alpha/\alpha'$-phase.
  In this paper a novel method that identifies transformation strains with ORs
is introduced and used to develop a new strain-based approach to phase
transformation models in steels. Using this approach, it is shown that the
transformation strains that leave a close packed plane in the $\gamma$-phase
and a close packed direction within that plane unrotated are precisely those
giving rise to the NW and KS ORs when a cubic product phase is considered.
Further, it is outlined how, by choosing different pairs of unrotated planes
and directions, other common ORs such as the ones by Pitsch (PT) and
Greninger-Troiano (GT) can be derived.
  One of the advantages of our approach is that it leads to a natural
generalisation of the NW, KS and other ORs for different ratios of
tetragonality $r$ of the product bct $\alpha'$-phase. These generalised ORs
predict a sharpening of the transformation textures with increasing
tetragonality and are thus in qualitative agreement with experiments on steels
with varying alloy concentration.

positive support and negative support values to find similar temporal
association patterns of user interest. The main advantage of our method is
that, it performs only a single scan of temporal database to find temporal
association patterns similar to specified reference support sequence. This
single database scan approach hence eliminates the huge overhead incurred when
the database is scanned multiple times. The present approach also eliminates
the need to compute and maintain true support values of all the subsets of
temporal patterns of previous stages when computing temporal patterns of next

the charge current couples predominantly to the antiferromagnetic order
parameter and the sublattice-canting moment in, respectively, the limits of
large and small exchange coupling. The effects can be quantified by analyzing
the antiferromagnetic spin-wave dispersions in the presence of charge current:
in the limit of large exchange coupling the spin-wave Doppler shift always
occurs, whereas, in the opposite limit, the only spin-wave modes to react to
the charge current are ones that carry a pronounced sublattice-canting moment.
The findings offer a framework for understanding and designing spin-transfer
torques in antiferromagnets belonging to different classes of sublattice
structures such as, e.g., bipartite and layered antiferromagnets.

has been some recent interest in probabilistic modeling of the outputs of
computations that are too expensive to run. Since mathematical logic is a
powerful tool for reasoning about computer programs, we consider this problem
from the perspective of integrating probability and logic. Recent work on
assigning probabilities to mathematical statements has used the concept of
coherent distributions, which satisfy logical constraints such as the
probability of a sentence and its negation summing to one. Although there are
algorithms which converge to a coherent probability distribution in the limit,
this yields only weak guarantees about finite approximations of these
distributions. In our setting, this is a significant limitation: Coherent
distributions assign probability one to all statements provable in a specific
logical theory, such as Peano Arithmetic, which can prove what the output of
any terminating computation is; thus, a coherent distribution must assign
probability one to the output of any terminating computation. To model
uncertainty about computations, we propose to work with approximations to
coherent distributions. We introduce inductive coherence, a strengthening of
coherence that provides appropriate constraints on finite approximations, and
propose an algorithm which satisfies this criterion.

Survey effects complicate the estimation and description of the power spectrum
on the largest angular scales. The pixel-space likelihood yields parameter
distributions without the power spectrum as an intermediate step, but it does
not have the large suite of tests available to power spectral methods. Searches
for primordial B-modes must rigorously reject and rule out contamination. Many
forms of contamination vary or are uncorrelated across epochs, frequencies,
surveys, or other data treatment subsets. The cross power and the power
spectrum of the difference of subset maps provide approaches to reject and
isolate excess variance. We develop an analogous joint pixel-space likelihood.
Contamination not modeled in the likelihood produces parameter-dependent bias
and complicates the interpretation of the difference map. We describe a null
test that consistently weights the difference map. Excess variance should

software and accelerator hardware, with particle numbers up to 128k. The
primary focus is on the accretion rate of stars by the black hole (equivalent
to their tidal disruption rate for black holes in the small to medium mass
range) and the eccentricity distribution of these stars. Our simulations vary
not only the particle number, but disc model (two models examined), spatial
resolution at the centre (characterised by the numerical accretion radius) and
softening length. The large parameter range and physically realistic modelling
allow us for the first time to confidently extrapolate these results to real
galactic centres. While in a real galactic centre both particle number and
accretion radius differ by a few orders of magnitude from our models, which are
constrained by numerical capability, we find that the stellar accretion rate
converges for models with N > 32k. The eccentricity distribution of accreted
stars, however, does not converge. We find that there are two competing effects
at work when improving the resolution: larger particle number leads to a
smaller fraction of stars accreted on nearly-circular orbits, while higher
spatial resolution increases this fraction. We scale our simulations to some
nearby galaxies and find that the expected boost in stellar accretion (or tidal
disruption, which could be observed as X-ray flares) in the presence of a gas
disc is about a factor of 10. Even with this boost, the accretion of mass from
stars is still a factor of ~ 100 slower than the accretion of gas from the
disc. Thus, it seems accretion of stars is not a major contributor to black
hole mass growth.

observations of the well-suited pair of M-stars GJ 725A+B to delve into the
sub-night HARPS-N response. Besides the possible presence of a low-mass planet
orbiting GJ 725B, our observations reveal changes in the spectral energy
distribution (SED) correlated with measurements of the width of the
instrumental line profile and, to a lower degree, with the Doppler
measurements. To study the origin of these effects, we searched for
correlations among several quantities defined and measured on the spectra and
on the acquisition images.
  We find that the changes in apparent SED are very likely related to flux
losses at the fibre input. Further tests indicate that such flux losses do not
seriously affect the shape of the instrumental point spread function of
HARPS-N, but identify an inefficient fitting of the continuum as the most
likely source of the systematic variability observed in the FWHM. This index,
accounting for the HARPS-N cross-correlation profiles width, is often used to
decorrelate Doppler time-series. We show that the Doppler measurement obtained
by a parametric least-squares fitting of the spectrum accounting for continuum
variability is insensitive to changes in the slope of the SED, suggesting that
forward modeling techniques to measure moments of the line profile are the
optimal way to achieve higher accuracy. Remaining residual variability at ~1
m/s suggests that for M-stars Doppler surveys the current noise floor still has
an instrumental origin.

between the brightest group galaxy and the center of mass of the group members.
We find that the Illustris simulation, over-produces large luminosity gap
galaxy systems, known as fossil systems, in comparison to observations and the
probed semi-analytical predictions. However, this simulation is equally
successful in recovering the correlation between luminosity gap and luminosity
centroid offset, in comparison to the probed semi-analytic model. We find
evolutionary tracks based on luminosity gap which indicate that a large
luminosity gap group is rooted in a small luminosity gap group, regardless of
the position of the brightest group galaxy within the halo. This simulation
helps, for the first time, to explore the black hole mass and its accretion
rate in galaxy groups. For a given stellar mass of the brightest group
galaxies, the black hole mass is larger in dynamically relaxed groups with a
lower rate of mass accretion. We find this consistent with the latest
observational studies of the radio activities in the brightest group galaxies
in fossil groups. We also find that the IGM in dynamically evolved groups is
hotter for a given halo mass than that in evolving groups, again consistent

the rate at which dense gas forms stars, SFE_dense traced by IR/HCN, depend on

density, high molecular gas fraction regions of the galaxy show high dense gas
fractions and low dense gas star formation efficiencies. This agrees with
recent results for individual pointings by Usero et al. 2015 but using unbiased
whole-galaxy maps. It also agrees qualitatively with the behavior observed
contrasting our own Solar Neighborhood with the central regions of the Milky

seed black hole immediately after a galaxy forms. When the mass of the seed is
set at 10^5 M_sun, we find that the model results become inconsistent with
recent observational results of the black hole mass - bulge mass relation for
dwarf galaxies. In particular, the model predicts that bulges with ~ 10^9 M_sun
harbour larger black holes than observed. On the other hand, when we employ
seed black holes with 10^3 M_sun, or randomly select their mass within a
10^(3-5) M_sun range, the resulting relation is consistent with observation
estimates, including the observed dispersion. We find that to obtain stronger

abundances, most are in fact worse. The high abundance of refractory elements
leads to an overproduction of neutrinos, with a predicted $^8$B flux that is
nearly twice its observed value, and $^7$Be and CNO fluxes that are
experimentally ruled out at high confidence. A combined likelihood analysis
shows that models using the vSZ16 abundances fare worse than AGSS09 despite a

produce fractal behaviors or modify the scale of cosmic homogeneity. From the
footprint of BOSS-DR12, we build a homogeneous sample following the radial
selection function for 73,412 points limited to the redshift range
$0.002<z<0.2$. Different percentages of observational holes were created
cumulatively in RA and dec on the sample. For the synthetic sample and for a
real sample of galaxies we determined the fractal dimension $D_q(r)$ in the
range $2\leq q\leq6$ using the sliding window technique to characterize the
spatial point distribution. Our results show that generalized dimension varies
with the scale, for low scales there are a fractal behavior with fluctuations
for all hole percentages studied and for larger scales than 113 Mpc/h the
statistical homogeneity is achieved in concordance with other analysis. We find
that observational holes cause a shift in the homogeneity scale $r_H$, in
particular for synthetic samples with percentages of holes between 0-10% the
homogeneity scale is reached at $(83\pm1)$Mpc/h while the fractal dimension
changes as $2.83^{\pm0.09}\leq D_q\leq2.855^{\pm0.09}$. For synthetic samples
with percentages of holes greater than 10%, we find that the value of $r_H$
increases proportionally. Consequently future results about homogeneity scale
based in fractal analyses must be corrected by observational holes and regions
of incompleteness in the geometry of the galaxy catalogue if the size of the

Their large dispersion measures, RMs and the large RM variation between these
pulsars and other known objects in the GC implies that the pulsars lie in the
GC and are not merely seen in projection towards the GC. The large RMs of these
pulsars indicate large line-of-sight magnetic field components between ~ 16-33
microgauss; combined with recent model predictions for the strength of the
magnetic field in the GC this implies that the large-scale magnetic field has a
very small inclination angle with respect to the plane of the sky (~ 12
degrees). Foreground objects like the Radio Arc or possibly an ablated, ionized
halo around the molecular cloud G0.11-0.11 could contribute to the large RMs of
two of the pulsars. If these pulsars lie behind the Radio Arc or G0.11-0.11
then this proves that low-scattering corridors with lengths >~ 100 pc must
exist in the GC. This also suggests that future, sensitive observations will be

mock catalogues, in which we anchor the photometric redshifts to the 3D galaxy
distribution of the available spectroscopic redshifts. We then estimate the
local density contrast by counting objects in cylindrical cells with radius
from 1 to 10 h$^{-1}$Mpc over the redshift range 0.9<z<1.8. We compare this
density field with the one computed in a mock catalogue with the same depth as
the Euclid Deep survey (H=26) but without redshift measurement errors. We find
that our method successfully separates high from low density environments (the
last from the first quintile of the density distribution), with higher
efficiency at low redshift and large cell: the fraction of low density regions
mistaken by high density peaks is <1% for all scales and redshifts explored,

that we can efficiently study environment in photometric samples if
spectroscopic information is available for a smaller sample of objects that
sparsely samples the same volume. We demonstrate that these studies are
possible in the Euclid Deep survey, i.e. in a redshift range in which
environmental effects are different from those observed in the local universe,
hence providing new constraints for galaxy evolution models.

Gibbs ensemble rather than a pure thermal ensemble at late times. We construct
the holographic dual of the generalized Gibbs ensemble and show that, to
leading order, it is still described by a BTZ black hole. The extra conserved

mass transfer will occur from the WD to the NS through the inner Lagrange
point. The accreted magnetized materials may trigger magnetic reconnection when
they approach the NS surface, and therefore the electrons can be accelerated to
an ultra-relativistic speed. In this scenario, the curvature radiation of the
electrons moving along the NS magnetic field lines can account for the
characteristic frequency and the timescale of an FRB. Owing to the conservation
of angular momentum, the WD may be kicked away after a burst, and the next

within each loop. In this paper, we apply this approach to a long duration
two-ribbon flare SOL2011-09-13T22 observed by the Atmosphere Imaging Assembly

multiple EUV wavelengths, each thread should be heated in two phases, an
intense impulsive heating followed by a gradual, low-rate heating tail that is
attenuated over 20-30 minutes. Each AIA resolved single loop may be composed of
several such threads. The two-phase heating scenario is supported by modeling
with both a zero-dimensional and a 1D hydrodynamic code. We discuss viable
physical mechanisms for the two-phase heating in a post-reconnection thread.

analysis of spatially-resolved multi-wavelength observations of chromospheric
evaporation during an M 1.0 class solar flare (SOL2014-06-12T21:12) using data
from the NASA's IRIS (Interface Region Imaging Spectrograph) and HMI/SDO

high-resolution observations, covering the temperature range from 10^4 K to

the hot evaporating plasma is delayed relative to the C II redshift of the
relatively cold chromospheric plasma by about 1 min. The spatial distribution
of the delays is not uniform across the region and can be as long as 2 min in
several zones. Using vector magnetograms from HMI we reconstruct the magnetic
field topology and the quasi-separatrix layer (QSL) and find that the blueshift
delay regions as well as the H-alpha flare ribbons are connected to the region
of magnetic polarity inversion line (PIL) and an expanding flux rope via a
system of low-lying loop arcades with height < ~4.5 Mm. This allows us to
propose an interpretation of the chromospheric evaporation based on the
geometry of local magnetic fields, and the primary energy source associated
with the PIL.

the present epoch, is strongly constrained by observations of both the
extragalactic and Galactic gamma-ray backgrounds. However, while the dominant
contribution to the extragalactic background comes from the time-integrated
emission of PBHs with initial mass M_*, the Galactic background is dominated by
the instantaneous emission of those with initial mass slightly larger than M_*
and current mass below M_*. Also, the instantaneous emission of PBHs smaller
than 0.4 M_* mostly comprises secondary particles produced by the decay of
directly emitted quark and gluon jets. These points were missed in the earlier
analysis by Lehoucq et al. using EGRET data. For a monochromatic PBH mass
function, with initial mass (1+\mu) M_* and \mu << 1, the current mass is
(3\mu)^{1/3} M_* and the Galactic background constrains the fraction of the
Universe going into PBHs as a function of \mu. However, the initial mass
function cannot be precisely monochromatic and even a tiny spread of mass
around M_* would generate a current low-mass tail of PBHs below M_*. This tail
would be the main contributor to the Galactic background, so we consider its
form and the associated constraints for a variety of scenarios with both
extended and nearly-monochromatic initial mass functions. In particular, we
consider a scenario in which the PBHs form from critical collapse and have a
mass function which peaks well above M_*. In this case, the largest PBHs could
provide the dark matter without the M_* ones exceeding the gamma-ray background
limits.

crossing-free geometric graphs on a planar point set. The framework generalizes
ideas of Alvarez and Seidel, who used them to count triangulations in time
$O(2^nn^2)$ where $n$ is the number of points. The main idea is to reduce the
problem of counting geometric graphs to counting source-sink paths in a
directed acyclic graph.
  The following new results will emerge. The number of all crossing-free
geometric graphs can be computed in time $O(c^nn^4)$ for some $c < 2.83929$.
The number of crossing-free convex partitions can be computed in time
$O(2^nn^4)$. The number of crossing-free perfect matchings can be computed in
time $O(2^nn^4)$. The number of convex subdivisions can be computed in time
$O(2^nn^4)$. The number of crossing-free spanning trees can be computed in time
$O(c^nn^4)$ for some $c < 7.04313$. The number of crossing-free spanning cycles
can be computed in time $O(c^nn^4)$ for some $c < 5.61804$.
  With the same bounds on the running time we can construct data structures
which allow fast enumeration of the respective classes. For example, after
$O(2^nn^4)$ time of preprocessing we can enumerate the set of all crossing-free
perfect matchings using polynomial time per enumerated object. For
crossing-free perfect matchings and convex partitions we further obtain
enumeration algorithms where the time delay for each (in particular, the first)
output is bounded by a polynomial in $n$.
  All described algorithms are comparatively simple, both in terms of their
analysis and implementation.

between them, leading to a net repulsive force.

large power systems. Its dependence on communication of remote measurement

develops a framework to analyze and quantify resilience of a given wide-area
controller under disruptive attacks on certain communication links. Resilience
of a given controller is measured in terms of closed-loop eigenvalues under the
worst possible attack strategy. The computation of such a resilience index is
challenging especially for large-scale power systems due to the discrete nature
of the attack strategies. To address the challenge, we propose an
optimization-based formulation and a convex relaxation approach to facilitate
the computation. Conditions under which the relaxation is exact are derived and
an efficient algorithm with guaranteed convergence is also developed. The
proposed framework and the algorithm allow us to quantify resilience for given
wide-area controllers and also provide sufficient conditions to guarantee
closed-loop stability under all possible communication attacks. Simulations are
performed on the IEEE 39-bus system to illustrate the proposed resilience

Our retrieval technique employs a geometric albedo model coupled with both a

sampling algorithm (MultiNest) to map the posterior distribution. This
combination makes the global evidence calculation more robust for any given
model, and highlights possible discrepancies in the likelihood maps. As a
proof-of-concept, our current atmospheric model contains 1 or 2 cloud layers,
methane as a major absorber, and a H$_2$-He background gas. This 6-to-9
parameter model is appropriate for Jupiter-like planets and can be easily
expanded in the future. In addition to deriving the marginal likelihood
distribution and confidence intervals for the model parameters, we perform
model selection to determine the significance of methane and cloud detection as
a function of expected signal-to-noise in the presence of spectral noise
correlations. After internal validation, the method is applied to realistic
spectra of Jupiter, Saturn, and HD 99492 c, a model observing target. We find
that the presence or absence of clouds and methane can be determined with high
confidence, while parameter uncertainties are model-dependent and correlated.
Such general methods will also be applicable to the interpretation of direct

situation where the resources for longitudinal data collection are limited, by
determining the optimal locations in time where measurements should be taken.
As for all optimal designs, some prior information is needed to implement the
proposed optimal designs. We demonstrate that this prior information may come
from a pilot longitudinal study that has irregularly measured and noisy
measurements, where for each subject one has available a small random number of
repeated measurements that are randomly located on the domain. A second
possibility of interest is that a pilot study consists of densely measured
functional data and one intends to take only a few measurements at
strategically placed locations in the domain for the future collection of
similar data. We construct optimal designs by targeting two criteria: (a)
Optimal designs to recover the unknown underlying smooth random trajectory for
each subject from a few optimally placed measurements such that squared
prediction errors are minimized; (b) Optimal designs that minimize prediction
errors for functional linear regression with functional or longitudinal
predictors and scalar responses, again from a few optimally placed
measurements. The proposed optimal designs address the need for sparse data
collection when planning longitudinal studies, by taking advantage of the close
connections between longitudinal and functional data analysis. We demonstrate
in simulations that the proposed designs perform considerably better than
randomly chosen design points and include a motivating data example from the
Baltimore longitudinal study of aging. The proposed designs are shown to have
an asymptotic optimality property.

attractor (strong attractor) for the primitive equations (PEs) of large-scale
ocean and atmosphere dynamics under $non$-$periodic$ boundary conditions and
driven by infinite-dimensional additive fractional Wiener processes. In
contrast to our new method, the common method, compact Sobolev embedding
theorem, is to obtain the uniform $a$ $priori$ estimates in some Sobolev space
whose regularity is high enough. But this is very complicated for the 3D
stochastic PEs with the $non$-$periodic$ boundary conditions. Therefore, the
existence of universal attractor ( weak attractor) was established in previous
work.
  The main idea of our method is that we first derive that $\mathbb{P}$-almost
surely the solution operator of stochastic PEs is compact. Then we construct a
compact absorbing set by virtue of the compact property of the the solution
operator and the existence of a absorbing set. We should point out that our
method has some advantages over the common method of using compact Sobolev
embedding theorem, i.e., if the random attractor in some Sobolev space do exist
in view of the common method, our method would then further implies the
existence of random attractor in this space. The present work provides a
general way for proving the existence of random attractor for common classes of
dissipative stochastic partial differential equations and improves the existing
results concerning random attractor of stochastic PEs. In a forth coming paper,
we use this new method to prove the existence of strong attractor for the

imaging, we investigate the mutual influence of two pulsed jets under
conditions relevant to low-speed maneuvering in a vehicle ($Re\approx350,$

different nozzle spacings using a new force estimation technique based on the

jets, the efficiency and thrust generated by the pair of interacting jets can
fall by as much as 10\% when the jets are brought into close proximity.
Empirically, the thrust $T$ falls off with the non-dimensional jet spacing
$\widetilde{\Delta}$ as $T=T_\infty(1-Co \widetilde{\Delta}^{-6})$ for a thrust
coupling coefficient $Co=2.04 \pm 0.11.$ Finally, we predict this leading order

zeros at locations other than the nodes of the eigenstates that comprise them.
It is shown that if an infinite potential barrier is suddenly raised at some or
all of these zeros, the well can be split into multiple adjacent infinite
square wells without affecting the wavefunction. This effects a change of the
energy eigenbasis of the state to a basis that does not commute with the
original, and a subsequent measurement of the energy now reveals a completely
different spectrum, which we call the {interference energy spectrum} of the

the stationary nodes of any eigenstate does not change the measurable energy of
the state. Of particular interest, this procedure can result in measurable
energies that are greater than the energy of the highest mode in the original
superposition, raising questions about the conservation of energy akin to those
that have been raised in the study of superoscillations. An analytic derivation
is given for the interference spectrum of a given wavefunction $\Psi(x,t)$ with
$N$ known zeros located at points $s_i = (x_i, t_i)$. Numerical simulations
were used to verify that a barrier can be rapidly raised at a zero of the

(J.
Fluid Mech., 768, 415-441) to consider the design of compliant walls for
turbulent skin friction reduction. Specifically, the effects of simple
spring-damper walls are contrasted with the effects of more complex walls
incorporating tension, stiffness and anisotropy. In addition, varying mass
ratios are tested to provide insight into differences between aerodynamic and
hydrodynamic applications. Despite the differing physical responses, all the
walls tested exhibit some important common features. First, the effect of the
walls (positive or negative) is greatest at conditions close to resonance, with
sharp transitions in performance across the resonant frequency or phase speed.
Second, compliant walls are predicted to have a more pronounced effect on
slower-moving structures because such structures generally have larger
wall-pressure signatures. Third, two-dimensional (spanwise constant) structures
are particularly susceptible to further amplification. These features are
consistent with many previous experiments and simulations, suggesting that
mitigating the rise of such two-dimensional structures is essential to
designing performance-improving walls. For instance, it is shown that further
amplification of such large-scale two-dimensional structures explains why the
optimal anisotropic walls identified by Fukagata et al. via DNS (J. Turb., 9,
1-17) only led to drag reduction in very small domains. The above observations
are used to develop design and methodology guidelines for future research on
compliant walls.

the spin temperature of the gas (degenerate with the covering factor) varies
significantly across the disk. This is consistent with the uniformity of spin
temperature measured across the Galactic disk. Furthermore, comparison with the
Galactic distribution suggests that intervening 21-cm absorption preferentially
arises in disks of high inclinations (near face-on). We also investigate the
hypothesis that 21-cm absorption is favourably detected towards compact radio
sources. Although there is insufficient data to determine whether there is a
higher detection rate towards quasar, rather than radio galaxy, sight-lines,
the 21-cm detections intervene objects with a mean turnover frequency of 5 x
10^8 Hz, compared to 1 x 10^8 Hz for the non-detections. Since the turnover
frequency is anti-correlated with radio source size, this does indicate a
preferential bias for detection towards compact background radio sources.

spiral pattern is taken to rotate rigidly in a galactic disc with a constant,
definite pattern speed. The observational measurement of the pattern speed of
the spiral arms, though difficult, has been achieved in a few galaxies such as
NGC 6946, NGC 2997, and M 51 which we consider here. We examine whether the
theoretical dispersion relation permits a real solution for wavenumber
corresponding to a stable wave, for the observed rotation curve and the pattern
speed values. We find that the disc when treated to consist of stars alone, as
is usually done in literature, does not generally support a stable density wave
for the observed pattern speed. Instead the inclusion of the low velocity
dispersion component, namely, gas, is essential to obtain a stable density
wave. Further, we obtain a theoretical range of allowed pattern speeds that
correspond to a stable density wave at a certain radius, and check that for the
three galaxies considered, the observed pattern speeds fall in the respective
prescribed range. The inclusion of even a small amount (~ 15 %) of gas by mass
fraction in the galactic disc is shown to have a significant dynamical effect
on the dispersion relation and hence on the pattern speed that is likely to be
seen in a real, gas-rich spiral galaxy.

problems of using partially implicit schemes, demonstrate the importance of
using fully implicit schemes and discuss the limitation of energy stability
that are often used to evaluate the quality of a numerical scheme for
phase-field modeling. In particular, we make the following observations: 1. a
convex splitting scheme (CSS in short) can be equivalent to some fully implicit
scheme (FIS in short) with a much different time scaling and thus it may lack
numerical accuracy; 2. most implicit schemes (in discussions) are energy-stable
if the time-step size is sufficiently small; 3. a traditionally known
conditionally energy-stable scheme still possess an unconditionally
energy-stable physical solution; 4. an unconditionally energy-stable scheme is
not necessarily better than a conditionally energy-stable scheme when the time
step size is not small enough; 5. a first-order FIS for the Allen-Cahn model
can be devised so that the maximum principle will be valid on the discrete
level and hence the discrete phase variable satisfies $|u_h(x)|\le 1$ for all
$x$ and, furthermore, the linearized discretized system can be effectively
preconditioned by discrete Poisson operators.

and clusters. Its physical origin lies in the kpc-scale interaction of AGN jets
with the intracluster medium. Large-scale jet simulations often initiate light
internally-supersonic jets with density contrast $0.01<\eta<1$. Here we argue
for the first time for the importance of very-light ($\eta<0.01$)
internally-subsonic jets. We investigated the shapes of young X-ray cavities
produced in a suite of hydrodynamic simulations, and found that bottom-wide
cavities are always produced by internally-subsonic jets, while
internally-supersonic jets inflate cylindrical, center-wide, or top-wide
cavities. We found examples of real cavities with shapes analogous to those
inflated in our simulations by internally-subsonic and internally-supersonic
jets, suggesting a dichotomy of AGN jets according to their internal Mach
numbers. We further studied the long-term cavity evolution, and found that old
cavities resulted from light jets spread along the jet direction, while those
produced by very light jets are significantly elongated along the perpendicular
direction. The northwestern ghost cavity in Perseus is pancake-shaped,
providing tentative evidence for the existence of very light jets. Our
simulations show that very-light internally-subsonic jets decelerate faster and
rise much slower in the ICM than light internally-supersonic jets, possibly
depositing a larger fraction of jet energy to cluster cores and alleviating the
problem of low coupling efficiencies found previously. The internal Mach number
points to the jet's energy content, and internally-subsonic jets are
energetically dominated by non-kinetic energy, such as thermal energy, cosmic
rays, or magnetic fields.

other main operator of AGM belief change theory, i.e. contraction, receiving
relatively little attention. In this paper we extend the Harper Identity from
single-step change to define iterated contraction in terms of iterated
revision. Specifically, just as the Harper Identity provides a recipe for
defining the belief set resulting from contracting A in terms of (i) the
initial belief set and (ii) the belief set resulting from revision by not-A, we
look at ways to define the plausibility ordering over worlds resulting from
contracting A in terms of (iii) the initial plausibility ordering, and (iv) the
plausibility ordering resulting from revision by not-A. After noting that the
most straightforward such extension leads to a trivialisation of the space of
permissible orderings, we provide a family of operators for combining
plausibility orderings that avoid such a result. These operators are
characterised in our domain of interest by a pair of intuitively compelling
properties, which turn out to enable the derivation of a number of iterated
contraction postulates from postulates for iterated revision. We finish by
observing that a salient member of this family allows for the derivation of
counterparts for contraction of some well known iterated revision operators, as

three are unambiguously and three others are possibly connected to Ellerman
bombs (EBs), which show intense brightening of the extended H$_{\alpha}$ wings
without leaving an obvious signature in the H$_{\alpha}$ core. These bombs
generally reveal the following distinct properties: (1) The
O~{\sc{iv}}~1401.156\AA{} and 1399.774\AA{} lines are absent or very weak; (2)
The Mn~{\sc{i}}~2795.640\AA{} line manifests as an absorption feature
superimposed on the greatly enhanced Mg~{\sc{ii}}~k line wing; (3) The
Mg~{\sc{ii}}~k and h lines show intense brightening in the wings and no
dramatic enhancement in the cores; (4) Chromospheric absorption lines such as
Ni~{\sc{ii}}~1393.330\AA{} and 1335.203\AA{} are very strong; (5) The 1700\AA{}
images obtained with the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly on board the Solar
Dynamics Observatory reveal intense and compact brightenings. These properties
support the formation of these bombs in the photosphere, demonstrating that EBs
can be heated much more efficiently than previously thought. We also
demonstrate that the Mg~{\sc{ii}}~k and h lines can be used to investigate EBs
similarly to H$_{\alpha}$, which opens a promising new window for EB studies.
The remaining four IBs obviously have no connection to EBs and they do not have
the properties mentioned above, suggesting a higher formation layer possibly in
the chromosphere.

the recently-discovered very-high-energy (VHE, $E>$ 100 GeV) blazar S4 0954+65
($z=0.368$) during an exceptionally bright optical flare in 2015 February.
During the time period (2015 February, 13/14, or MJD 57067) when the MAGIC
telescope detected VHE $\gamma$-ray emission from the source, the Fermi-LAT
data indicated a significant spectral hardening at GeV energies, with a
power-law photon index of $1.8 \pm 0.1$---compared with the 3FGL value
(averaged over four years of observation) of $2.34 \pm 0.04$. In contrast,
Swift/XRT data showed a softening of the X-ray spectrum, with a photon index of
$1.72 \pm 0.08$ (compared with $1.38 \pm 0.03$ averaged during the flare from
MJD 57066 to 57077), possibly indicating a modest contribution of synchrotron
photons by the highest-energy electrons superposed on the inverse Compton
component. Fitting of the quasi-simultaneous ($<1$ day) broadband spectrum with
a one-zone synchrotron plus inverse-Compton model revealed that GeV/TeV
emission could be produced by inverse-Compton scattering of external photons
from the dust torus. We emphasize that a flaring blazar showing high flux of
$\gtrsim 1.0 \times 10^{-6}$ photons cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$ ($E>$ 100 MeV) and a
hard spectral index of $\Gamma_{\rm GeV} < 2.0$ detected by Fermi-LAT on daily

telescopes to discover high-redshift blazars, investigate their temporal
variability and spectral features in the VHE band, and also constrain the
intensity of the extragalactic background light.

by a delay-tolerant information dissemination algorithm in a specialized
setting. The specialized Delay Tolerant Network (DTN) system comprises static
message buffers or throwboxes kept in popular places besides the mobile agents
hopping from one place to another. We identify that an information
dissemination technique that exploits the throwbox infrastructure can cover
only a fixed number of popular places irrespective of the time spent. We notice
that such DTN system has a natural bipartite network correspondence where two
sets are the popular places and people visiting those places. This helps
leveraging the theories of evolving bipartite networks (BNW) to provide an
appropriate explanation of the observed temporal invariance of information
coverage over the DTN. In this work, we first show that information coverage
can be estimated by the size of the largest component in the thresholded
one-mode projection of BNW. Next, we also show that exploiting a special
property of BNW, the size of the largest component size can be calculated from
the degree distribution. Combining these two, we derive a closed form simple
equation to accurately predict the amount of information coverage in DTN which
is almost impossible to achieve using the traditional techniques such as
epidemic or Markov modeling. The equation shows that full coverage quickly
becomes extremely difficult to achieve if the number of places increases while
variation in agent's activity helps in covering more places.

importance in formation and evolution of circumstellar disks. Many molecular
line observations toward young stellar objects indicate that radial
distributions of the specific angular momentum $j$ are more or less universal.
In small scales, typically $R\lesssim$ 100 AU, the specific angular momenta
distribute like $j\propto r^{1/2}$, indicating existence of rotationally
supported disk. In outer regions, $R\gtrsim$ 5000 AU, $j$ increases as the
radius increases and the slope is steeper than unity, which is supposed to
reflect the original angular momentum distributions in the maternal molecular
clouds. And lastly there is a connecting region, 100 AU $\lesssim R \lesssim$
5000 AU, in which $j$-distribution looks almost flat. While this is often
interpreted as a consequence of conservation of the specific angular momentum,
it actually is insufficient and requires a stronger condition that the initial
distribution of $j$ must be spatially uniform. However, this requirement is
unrealistic and inconsistent with observations. In this work, we propose a
simple alternative explanation; the flat $j$ profile is produced by strong
prolongation due to the large velocity gradient in the accreting flow no matter
what the initial $j$ distribution is. We provide a simple analytic model for
gravitational collapse of molecular clouds. This model can be used to estimate
ages of protostars based solely on the observed rotation profile. We
demonstrate its validity in comparison with hydrodynamic simulations, and apply
the model to young stellar objects such as L1527 IRS, TMC-1A and B335.

we do not assume that the graphs satisfy the standard condition (K), so that
the graph $C^*$-algebras may come with uncountable ideal structures.
  We find that in this generality, stable isomorphism of graph $C^*$-algebras
does not coincide with the geometric notion of Cuntz move equivalence. However,
adding a modest condition on the graphs, the two notions are proved to be
mutually equivalent and equivalent to the $C^*$-algebras having isomorphic

$C^*$-algebras are in fact classifiable by $K$-theory, providing in particular
complete classification when the $C^*$-algebras in question are either of real

properties of a newly discovered contact binary, 2MASS J11201034$-$2201340. We
serendipitously found this X-ray point source outside the error ellipse when
searching for possible X-ray counterparts of $\gamma$-ray millisecond pulsars
among the unidentified objects detected by the {\it Fermi Gamma-ray Space
Telescope}. The optical counterpart of the X-ray source (unrelated to the
$\gamma$-ray source) was then identified using archival databases. The
long-term CRTS survey detected a precise signal with a period of
$P=0.28876208(56)$ days. A follow-up observation made by the SLT telescope of
Lulin Observatory revealed the binary nature of the object. Utilizing archived
photometric data of multi-band surveys, we construct the spectral energy
distribution, which is well fitted by a K2V spectral template. The fitting
result of the orbital profile using the Wilson--Devinney code suggests that
2MASS J11201034-2201340 is a short-period A-type contact binary and the more
massive component has a cool spot. The X-ray emission was first noted in
observations made by \swift\, then further confirmed and characterized by an
\xmm\ observation. The X-ray spectrum can be described by a power law or
thermal Bremsstrahlung. Unfortunately, we could not observe significant X-ray
orbital modulation. Finally, according to the spectral energy distribution,
this system is estimated to be 690 pc from Earth with a calculated X-ray
intensity of $(0.7-1.5)\times 10^{30}$ erg s$^{-1}$, which is in the expected
range of an X-ray emitting contact binary.

evident in extreme ultraviolet (EUV) and soft X-ray observations. The locations
of dimming are sometimes considered to map footpoints of the erupting flux
rope. As the emitting material expands in the corona, the decreased plasma
density leads to reduced emission observed in spectral and irradiance
measurements. Therefore, signatures of dimming may reflect properties of CMEs
in the early phase of its eruption. In this study, we analyze the event of
flare, CME, and coronal dimming on December 26, 2011. We use the data from the
Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA) on Solar Dynamics Observatories (SDO) for
disk observations of the dimming, and analyze images taken by EUVI, COR1, and
COR2 onboard the Solar Terrestrial Relations Observatories to obtain the height
and velocity of the associated CMEs observed at the limb. We also measure
magnetic reconnection rate from flare observations. Dimming occurs in a few
locations next to the flare ribbons, and it is observed in multiple EUV
passbands. Rapid dimming starts after the onset of fast reconnection and CME
acceleration, and its evolution well tracks the CME height and flare
reconnection. The spatial distribution of dimming exhibits cores of deep
dimming with a rapid growth, and their light curves are approximately linearly
scaled with the CME height profile. From the dimming analysis, we infer the
process of the CME expansion, and estimate properties of the CME.

No domain structure deterioration has been observed for a month as inspected

broken power-law function of angular scales. The systematic shallowness of its
spectral slope is inconsistent with the standard Kolmogorov scaling. This
motivates us to examine the statistical analysis on RM fluctuations. The
correlations of RM constructed by Lazarian & Pogosyan (2016) are demonstrated
to be adequate in explaining the observed features of RM SFs through a direct
comparison between the theoretically obtained and observationally measured SF
results. By segregating the density and magnetic field fluctuations and
adopting arbitrary indices for their respective power spectra, we find that
when the SFs of RM and emission measure have a similar form over the same range
of angular scales, the statistics of the RM fluctuations reflect the properties
of density fluctuations. RM SFs can be used to evaluate the mean magnetic field
along the line of sight, but cannot serve as an informative source on the
properties of turbulent magnetic field in the interstellar medium. We identify
the spectral break of RM SFs as the inner scale of a shallow spectrum of
electron density fluctuations, which characterizes the typical size of discrete
electron density structures in the observed region.

a fundamental numerical primitive. For a number of reasons, one often seeks an
approximation whose rows are sampled from those of $A$. Row sampling improves
interpretability, saves space when $A$ is sparse, and preserves row structure,
which is especially important, for example, when $A$ represents a graph.
  However, correctly sampling rows from $A$ can be costly when the matrix is
large and cannot be stored and processed in memory. Hence, a number of recent
publications focus on row sampling in the streaming setting, using little more
space than what is required to store the outputted approximation [KL13,
KLM+14].
  Inspired by a growing body of work on online algorithms for machine learning
and data analysis, we extend this work to a more restrictive online setting: we
read rows of $A$ one by one and immediately decide whether each row should be
kept in the spectral approximation or discarded, without ever retracting these
decisions. We present an extremely simple algorithm that approximates $A$ up to
multiplicative error $\epsilon$ and additive error $\delta$ using $O(d \log d
\log(\epsilon||A||_2/\delta)/\epsilon^2)$ online samples, with memory overhead
proportional to the cost of storing the spectral approximation. We also present
an algorithm that uses $O(d^2$) memory but only requires
$O(d\log(\epsilon||A||_2/\delta)/\epsilon^2)$ samples, which we show is
optimal.
  Our methods are clean and intuitive, allow for lower memory usage than prior
work, and expose new theoretical properties of leverage score based matrix
approximation.

is to explore and exploit the relationships between new labels and past labels
and then inherit the relationship into hypotheses of labels to boost the
performance of new classifiers. In specific, we use the label
self-representation to model the label relationship, and SLL will be divided
into two steps: a regression problem and a empirical risk minimization (ERM)
problem. Both problems are simple and can be efficiently solved. We further
show that SLL can generate a tighter generalization error bound for new labels
than the general ERM framework with trace norm or Frobenius norm
regularization. Finally, we implement extensive experiments on various
benchmark datasets to validate the new setting. And results show that SLL can
effectively handle the constantly emerging new labels and provides excellent

theoretical analysis of secular gravitational instability (GI) described a
possible formation of multiple ring structures with separations of 13 AU around
a radius of 100 AU in protoplanetary disks under certain conditions. In this
article, we reanalyze the viability of secular GI by adopting the physical
values inferred from the observations. We derive the radial distributions of
the most unstable wavelength and the growth timescale of secular GI and verify
that secular GI can form the ring structures observed in HL Tau. When a
turbulent viscosity coefficient $\alpha$ remains small in inner region of the
disk, secular GI grows in the whole disk. Thus, the formation of planetary mass
objects should occur first in the inner region as a result of gravitational
fragmentation after the non-linear growth of secular GI. In this case,
resulting objects are expected to create the gaps at $r$ ~ 10 AU and ~ 30 AU.
As a result, all ring structures in HL Tau can be created by secular GI. If
this scenario is realized in HL Tau, the outer region corresponds to the
earlier growth phase of the most unstable mode of secular GI, and the inner
region corresponds to the outcome of the non-linear growth of secular GI.
Therefore, this interpretation suggests that we are possibly witnessing both
the beginning and end of planet formation in HL Tau.

arise in the analysis of time series or spatial data. Most of the definitions
of long memory of a stationary process $X=\{X_1, X_2,\cdots,\}$ are based on
the second-order properties of the process. The excess entropy of a stationary
process is the summation of redundancies which relates to the rate of
convergence of the conditional entropy $H(X_n|X_{n-1},\cdots, X_1)$ to the
entropy rate. It is proved that the excess entropy is identical to the mutual
information between the past and the future when the entropy $H(X_1)$ is
finite. We suggest the definition that a stationary process is long memory if
the excess entropy is infinite. Since the definition of excess entropy of a
stationary process requires very weak moment condition on the distribution of
the process, it can be applied to processes whose distributions without bounded
second moment. A significant property of excess entropy is that it is invariant
under invertible transformation, which enables us to know the excess entropy of
a stationary process from the excess entropy of other process. For stationary
Guassian process, the excess entropy characterization of long memory relates to
popular characterization well. It is proved that the excess entropy of
fractional Gaussian noise is infinite if the Hurst parameter $H \in (1/2, 1)$.

  Wireless Networks","10 pages, 6 figures",,,,"cs.NI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Offloading computation to a mobile cloud is a promising solution to augment
the computation capabilities of mobile devices. In this paper we consider
selfish mobile devices in a dense wireless network, in which individual mobile
devices can offload computations via multiple access points (APs) to a mobile
cloud so as to minimize their computation costs, and we provide a game
theoretical analysis of the problem. We show that in the case of an elastic
cloud, all improvement paths are finite, and thus a pure strategy Nash
equilibrium exists and can be computed easily. In the case of a non-elastic
cloud we show that improvement paths may cycle, yet we show that a pure Nash
equilibrium exists and we provide an efficient algorithm for computing one.
Furthermore, we provide an upper bound on the price of anarchy (PoA) of the
game. We use simulations to evaluate the time complexity of computing Nash
equilibria and to provide insights into the PoA under realistic scenarios. Our
results show that the equilibrium cost may be close to optimal, and the cost
difference is due to too many mobile users offloading simultaneously.

{\em horizontal $\alpha$-harmonic maps}, $\alpha\ge 1/2$, with respect to such

  If the distribution of planes is integrable then we recover the classical
case of $\alpha$-harmonic maps with values into a manifold. In this paper we
shall focus our attention to the case $\alpha=1/2$ in dimension $1$ and
$\alpha=2$ in dimension $2$ and we investigate the regularity of the {\em
horizontal $\alpha$-harmonic maps}. In both cases we show that such maps
satisfy a Schr\""odinger type system with an antisymmetric potential, that
permits us to apply the previous results obtained by the authors. Finally we
study the regularity of {\em variational $\alpha$-harmonic} maps which are
critical points of $\|(-\Delta)^{\alpha/2} u\|^2_{L^2}$ under the constraint to
be tangent (horizontal) to a given planes distribution. We produce a
convexification of this variational problem which permits to write it's Euler

OGLE-2012-BLG-0724Lb. Although the duration of the planetary signal for this
event was one of the shortest seen for a planetary event, the anomaly was well
covered thanks to high cadence observations taken by the survey groups OGLE and
MOA. By analyzing the light curve, this planetary system is found to have a
mass ratio $q=(1.58\pm0.15)\times10^{-3}$. By conducting a Bayesian analysis,
we estimate that the host star is an M-dwarf star with a mass of $M_{\rm
L}=0.29_{-0.16}^{+0.33} \ M_{\odot}$ located at $D_{\rm L}=6.7_{-1.2}^{+1.1} \
{\rm kpc}$ away from the Earth and the companion's mass is $m_{\rm

$a_{\perp}=1.6_{-0.3}^{+0.4} \ {\rm AU}$. Because the lens-source relative
proper motion is relatively high, future high resolution images would detect
the lens host star and determine the lens properties uniquely. This system is
likely a Saturn-mass exoplanet around an M-dwarf and such systems are commonly
detected by gravitational microlensing. This adds an another example of a
possible pileup of sub-Jupiters $(0.2 < m_{\rm P}/M_{\rm Jup} < 1)$ in contrast
to a lack of Jupiters ($\sim 1 - 2 \ M_{\rm Jup}$) around M-dwarfs, supporting
the prediction by core accretion models that Jupiter-mass or more massive

Overstaying of an EV after a charging event is a key contributor to low
utilization. Since overstaying is easily detectable by monitoring the power
drawn from the charger, managing this problem primarily involves designing an
appropriate ""penalty"" during the overstaying period. Higher penalties do
discourage overstaying; however, due to uncertainty in parking duration, less
people would find such penalties acceptable, leading to decreased utilization
(and revenue). To analyze this central trade-off, we develop a novel framework
that integrates models for realistic user behavior into queueing dynamics to
locate the optimal penalty from the points of view of utilization and revenue,
for different values of the external charging demand. Next, when the model
parameters are unknown, we show how an online learning algorithm, such as UCB,
can be adapted to learn the optimal penalty. Our experimental validation, based
on charging data from London, shows that an appropriate penalty can increase
both utilization and revenue while significantly reducing overstaying.

  generalized block-Toeplitz precision matrix",,,,,"stat.CO stat.ME","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Gaussian Markov random fields (GMRFs) are extensively used in statistics to
model area-based data and usually depend on several parameters in order to
capture complex spatial correlations. In this context, it is important to
determine the valid parameter space, namely the domain ensuring (semi)
positive-definiteness of the precision matrix. Depending on the structure of
the latter, this task can be challenging. While univari- ate GMRFs with
block-Toeplitz precision are well studied in the literature, not much is
analytically known about bivariate GMRFs. So far, only restrictive sufficient
conditions and brute-force approaches were proposed, which are computationally
expensive for the size of modern datasets. In this paper, we consider a
bivariate GMRF, which is part of a hierarchical model used in spatial
statistics to analyze data coming from projec- tions of regional climate
change. By extending classical convergence results of univariate fields with
toroidal boundary conditions to fields without boundary conditions, we pro-
vide asymptotically closed-form expressions of the valid parameter space. We
develop a general methodology that can be used to determine the valid parameter
space of bivariate GMRFs whose precision matrix has a generalized
block-Toeplitz structure and for which classical convergence results are not
directly applicable. Finally, we quantify the rate of convergence of our
approach through a numerical study in R.

two parts: (1) an exosystem generator that creates a local copy of the

an adaptation of the (centralized) internal model principle to the distributed,

principle which states an homogeneous and isotropic distribution of matter in
the universe on large scales. However, recent observations, such as the
temperature anisotropy of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) radiation, the
motion of galaxies in the universe, the polarization of quasars and the
acceleration of the cosmic expansion, indicate preferred directions in the sky.
If these directions have a cosmological origin, the cosmological principle
would be violated, and modern cosmology should be reconsidered. In this paper,
by considering the preferred axis in the CMB parity violation, we find that it
coincides with the preferred axes in CMB quadrupole and CMB octopole, and they
all align with the direction of the CMB kinematic dipole. In addition, the
preferred directions in the velocity flows, quasar alignment, anisotropy of the
cosmic acceleration, the handedness of spiral galaxies, and the angular
distribution of the fine-structure constant are also claimed to be aligned with
the CMB kinematic dipole. Since CMB dipole was confirmed to be caused by the
motion of our local group of galaxies relative to the reference frame of the
CMB, the coincidence of all these preferred directions hints that these
anomalies have a common origin, which is not cosmological or due to a
gravitational effect. The systematical or contaminative errors in observation
or in data analysis, which can be directly related to the motion of our local
group of galaxies, can play an important role in explaining the anomalies.

social and economic networks are often driven by cascading mechanisms, and so
are contagion dynamics in financial networks. Global behaviors generally emerge
from the interplay between the structure of the interconnection topology and
the local agents' interactions. We focus on the Linear Threshold Model (LTM) of
cascades first introduced by Granovetter (1978). This can be interpreted as the
best response dynamics in a network game whereby agents choose strategically
between two actions and their payoff is an increasing function of the number of
their neighbors choosing the same action. Each agent is equipped with an
individual threshold representing the number of her neighbors who must have
adopted a certain action for that to become the agent's best response. We
analyze the LTM dynamics on large-scale networks with heterogeneous agents.
Through a local mean-field approach, we obtain a nonlinear, one-dimensional,
recursive equation that approximates the evolution of the LTM dynamics on most
of the networks of a given size and distribution of degrees and thresholds.
Specifically, we prove that, on all but a fraction of networks with given
degree and threshold statistics that is vanishing as the network size grows
large, the actual fraction of adopters of a given action in the LTM dynamics is
arbitrarily close to the output of the aforementioned recursion. We then
analyze the dynamic behavior of this recursion and its bifurcations from a
dynamical systems viewpoint. Applications of our findings to some real network
testbeds show good adherence of the theoretical predictions to numerical
simulations.

annihilation (J) and decay (D) factors of dwarf spheroidal galaxies with both
analytic and numerical methods. Flattening has two consequences: first, there
is a geometric effect as the squeezing (or stretching) of the dark matter
distribution enhances (or diminishes) the J-factor; second, the line of sight
velocity dispersion of stars must hold up the flattened baryonic component in
the flattened dark matter halo. We provide analytic formulae and a simple
numerical approach to estimate the correction to the J- and D-factors required
over simple spherical modeling. The formulae are validated with a series of
equilibrium models of flattened stellar distributions embedded in flattened
dark-matter distributions. We compute corrections to the J- and D-factors for
the Milky Way dwarf spheroidal galaxies under the assumption that they are all
prolate or all oblate and find that the hierarchy of J-factors for the dwarf
spheroidals is slightly altered (typical correction factors for an ellipticity
of $0.4$ are $0.75$ for the oblate case and $1.6$ for the prolate case). We
demonstrate that spherical estimates of the D-factors are very insensitive to
the flattening and introduce uncertainties significantly less than the
uncertainties in the D-factors from the other observables for all the dwarf
spheroidals (for example, ${}^{+10\mathrm{\,percent}}_{-3\mathrm{\,percent}}$

we have demonstrated here. We find that with the exception of four diffuse

This game was introduced by Bennett (1989) motivated by applications in
designing space efficient reversible algorithms. Recently, Chan (2013) showed
that the reversible pebble game number of any DAG is the same as its
Dymond-Tompa pebble number and Raz-Mckenzie pebble number.
  We show, as our main result, that for any rooted directed tree T, its
reversible pebble game number is always just one more than the edge rank
coloring number of the underlying undirected tree U of T. It is known that
given a DAG G as input, determining its reversible pebble game number is
PSPACE-hard. Our result implies that the reversible pebble game number of trees
can be computed in polynomial time.
  We also address the question of finding the number of steps required to
optimally pebble various families of trees. It is known that trees can be
pebbled in $n^{O(\log(n))}$ steps where $n$ is the number of nodes in the tree.
Using the equivalence between reversible pebble game and the Dymond-Tompa
pebble game (Chan, 2013), we show that complete binary trees can be pebbled in
$n^{O(\log\log(n))}$ steps, a substantial improvement over the naive upper
bound of $n^{O(\log(n))}$. It remains open whether complete binary trees can be
pebbled in polynomial (in $n$) number of steps. Towards this end, we show that
almost optimal (i.e., within a factor of $(1 + \epsilon)$ for any constant
$\epsilon > 0$) pebblings of complete binary trees can be done in polynomial
number of steps.
  We also show a time-space trade-off for reversible pebbling for families of
bounded degree trees by a divide-and-conquer approach: for any constant
$\epsilon > 0$, such families can be pebbled using $O(n^\epsilon)$ pebbles in
$O(n)$ steps. This generalizes an analogous result of Kralovic (2001) for
chains.

rise, we conduct a performance evaluation of Compound TCP (C-TCP) in two
topologies: a single bottleneck and a multi-bottleneck topology, under
different traffic scenarios. The first topology consists of a single bottleneck
router, and the second consists of two distinct sets of TCP flows, regulated by
two edge routers, feeding into a common core router. We focus on some dynamical
and statistical properties of the underlying system. From a dynamical
perspective, we develop fluid models in a regime wherein the number of flows is
large, bandwidth-delay product is high, buffers are dimensioned small
(independent of the bandwidth-delay product) and routers deploy a Drop-Tail
queue policy. A detailed local stability analysis for these models yields the
following key insight: smaller buffers favour stability. Additionally, we
highlight that larger buffers, in addition to increasing latency, are prone to
inducing limit cycles in the system dynamics, via a Hopf bifurcation. These
limit cycles in turn cause synchronisation among the TCP flows, and also result
in a loss of link utilisation. For the topologies considered, we also
empirically analyse some statistical properties of the bottleneck queues. These
statistical analyses serve to validate an important modelling assumption: that
in the regime considered, each bottleneck queue may be approximated as either
an $M/M/1/B$ or an $M/D/1/B$ queue. This immediately makes the modelling
perspective attractive and the analysis tractable. Finally, we show that
smaller buffers, in addition to ensuring stability and low latency, would also
yield fairly good system performance, in terms of throughput and flow
completion times.

supernovae-driven galactic winds: a freely expanding steady-state wind and a
wind sourced by a self-similarly expanding superbubble including thermal heat
conduction. It is shown that, for the steady-state wind, matching the measured
correlation between the soft x-ray luminosity and star formation rate of
starburst galaxies is equivalent to producing a scaled wind mass-loading factor
relative to the star-formation rate of 0.5 - 3, in agreement with the amount
inferred from metal absorption line measurements. The match requires the
asymptotic wind velocity v_inf to scale with the star formation rate SFR (in
solar masses per year) approximately as v_inf ~ (700 - 1000) km/s SFR^{1/6}.
The corresponding mass injection rate is close to the amount naturally provided
by thermal evaporation from the wall of a superbubble in a galactic disc,
suggesting thermal evaporation may be a major source of mass-loading. The
predicted mass-loading factors from thermal evaporation within the galactic
disc alone, however, are somewhat smaller, 0.2 - 2, so that a further
contribution from cloud ablation or evaporation may be required. Both models
may account for the 1.4GHz luminosity of unresolved radio sources within
starburst galaxies for plausible parameters describing the distribution of

several useful features that make it compare favorably to the Diffie-Hellman

such a system. We show that the gap in such model scales linearly with SOC,
opposed to other oxide-based topological insulators, where smaller gaps tend to
appear by construction of the lattice. We also provide a study of the quantum

resolution, which remains a challenging task for super-resolution microscopy.
We have addressed this important issue by combining photo-activated
localization microscopy (PALM) with super-resolution optical fluctuation
imaging (SOFI). Using simulations and fixed cell focal adhesion images, we
investigated the complementarity between PALM and SOFI in terms of spatial and
temporal resolution. This PALM-SOFI framework was used to image focal adhesions
in living cells, while obtaining a temporal resolution below 10 s. We
visualized the dynamics of focal adhesions, and revealed local mean velocities
around 190 nm per minute. The complementarity of PALM and SOFI was assessed in
detail with a methodology that integrates a quantitative resolution and
signal-to-noise metric. This PALM and SOFI concept provides an enlarged
quantitative imaging framework, allowing unprecedented functional exploration
of focal adhesions through the estimation of molecular parameters such as the
fluorophore density and the photo-activation and photo-switching rates.

of multicast networks, at the cost of high decoding complexity. To improve the
performance-complexity tradeoff, we consider the design of sparse network
codes. A generation-based strategy is employed in which source packets are
grouped into overlapping subsets called generations. RLNC is performed only
amongst packets belonging to the same generation throughout the network so that
sparseness can be maintained. In this paper, generation-based network codes
with low reception overheads and decoding costs are designed for transmitting
of the order of $10^2$-$10^3$ source packets. A low-complexity
overhead-optimized decoder is proposed that exploits ""overlaps"" between
generations. The sparseness of the codes is exploited through local processing
and multiple rounds of pivoting of the decoding matrix. To demonstrate the
efficacy of our approach, codes comprising a binary precode, random overlapping
generations, and binary RLNC are designed. The results show that our designs
can achieve negligible code overheads at low decoding costs, and outperform
existing network codes that use the generation based strategy.

$T_i$ and $T_f$ on the aging properties and, in particular, on the behavior of
the autocorrelation $C$ and of the integrated response function $\chi$. Our
results show that for any choice of $T_f$, while the autocorrelation function
exponent $\lambda _C$ takes a markedly different value for $T_i=\infty$
[$\lambda _C(T_i=\infty)\simeq 5/4$] or $T_i=T_c$ [$\lambda _C(T_i=T_c)\simeq
1/8$] the response function exponents are unchanged. Supported by the outcome
of the analytical solution of the solvable spherical model we interpret this
fact as due to the different contributions provided to autocorrelation and
response by the large-scale properties of the system. As changing $T_f$ is
considered, although this is expected to play no role in the
large-scale/long-time properties of the system, we show important effects on
the quantitative behavior of $\chi$. In particular, data for quenches to
$T_f=0$ are consistent with a value of the response function exponent $\lambda
_\chi=\frac{1}{2}\lambda _C(T_i=\infty)=5/8$ different from the one [$\lambda
_\chi \in (0.5-0.56)$] found in a wealth of previous numerical determinations
in quenches to finite final temperatures. This is interpreted as due to
important pre-asymptotic corrections associated to $T_f>0$.

VLAD vector with the STR, providing a finer representation of the vector and
enabling us to get rid of the reordering phase. The experiments on a publicly

separation (PS) appears by tuning the system near a Lifshitz transition in
multiband Hubbard models. The PS in La2CuO4+y near insulator to metal
transition (IMT) is made of short range Charge Density Wave (CDW) order
inhomogeneity coexisting with quenched lattice disorder. While at high doping
y=0.1 percolation gives a single superconducting phase, near the IMT at y=0.06
two coexisting superconducting phases appear: the first one with a critical
temperature Tc1=16 K and the second one with Tc2=29K. It is known that the two
superconducting phases are characterized by two different space geometry
because of two different spatial distributions of both CDW order and dopants
self-organization. Here we show that these two phases show different flux
dynamic regimes using alternating current (AC) multi-harmonic susceptibility
experiments. This is a unique technique capable to investigate multi-phase
superconductors and characterize their transport properties in a percolative
scenario. Results point out that the low critical temperature phase is well
described by a bulk-like flux pinning with a 2D geometry while the phase with
higher critical temperature shows a barrier pinning mechanism providing direct
evidence of two different superconducting vortex dynamics in different complex
geometrical spaces.

without using part annotations, with an application to the challenging problem
of weakly supervised single-view reconstruction. This is in contrast to prior
works that require part annotations, since matching objects across class and
pose variations is challenging with appearance features alone. We overcome this
challenge through a novel deep learning architecture, WarpNet, that aligns an
object in one image with a different object in another. We exploit the
structure of the fine-grained dataset to create artificial data for training
this network in an unsupervised-discriminative learning approach. The output of
the network acts as a spatial prior that allows generalization at test time to
match real images across variations in appearance, viewpoint and articulation.
On the CUB-200-2011 dataset of bird categories, we improve the AP over an
appearance-only network by 13.6%. We further demonstrate that our WarpNet
matches, together with the structure of fine-grained datasets, allow
single-view reconstructions with quality comparable to using annotated point
correspondences.

fundamental building blocks for the realization of textbook many-body quantum

topological order or frustration. Step-by-step assembly promises an interesting
handle on the emergence of quantum collective behavior as one goes from one, to

ability to tune and measure local properties as the system size increases.
Here, we use low-temperature scanning tunneling microscopy to construct arrays
of magnetic atoms on a surface, designed to behave like spin-1/2 XXZ Heisenberg
chains in a transverse field, for which a quantum phase transition from an
antiferromagnetic to a paramagnetic phase is predicted in the thermodynamic
limit. Site-resolved measurements on these finite size realizations reveal a
number of sudden ground state changes when the field approaches the critical
value, each corresponding to a new domain wall entering the chains. We observe
that these state crossings become closer for longer chains, indicating the
onset of critical behavior. Our results present opportunities for further
studies on quantum behavior of many-body systems, as a function of their size

relationship between enclosed mass, velocity dispersion and half-light radius.
We extend the calculation to the spherical Navarro-Frenk-White (NFW) model, and
demonstrate that our new formulae give accurate results in comparison to more
elaborate Jeans models driven by Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods. Of the known
ultrafaint dwarf spheroidals, we show that Ursa Major II, Reticulum II, Tucana

$\gamma$ and outer slope $\beta$. The central and asymptotic behaviour of the

APEX, GBT, and IRAM 30-m telescopes. The observations were interpreted using a
gas-grain chemistry model combined with radiative transfer calculations. The
chemistry model distinguishes between the different nuclear spin states of
light hydrogen molecules, ammonia, and their deuterated forms. High deuterium
fractionation ratios with NH2D/NH3=0.4, NHD2/NH2D=0.2, and ND3/NHD2=0.06 were
found in the core. The observed ortho/para ratios of NH2D and NHD2 are close to
the corresponding nuclear spin statistical weights. The chemistry model can
approximately reproduce the observed abundances, but predicts uniformly too low
ortho/para-NH2D, and too large ortho/para-NHD2 ratios. The longevity of N2H+
and NH3 in dense gas, which is prerequisite to their strong deuteration, can be
attributed to the chemical inertia of N2 on grain surfaces. The discrepancies
between the chemistry model and the observations are likely to be caused by the
fact that the model assumes complete scrambling in principal gas-phase
deuteration reactions of ammonia, which means that all the nuclei are mixed in
reactive collisions. If, instead, these reactions occur through proton
hop/hydrogen abstraction processes, statistical spin ratios are to be expected.
The present results suggest that while the deuteration of ammonia changes with
physical conditions and time, the nuclear spin ratios of ammonia isotopologues
do not probe the evolutionary stage of a cloud.

$M_{BH}$ of the rSMBH candidates are on average $\sim$5 times smaller than that
of their stationary counterparts and cause a scatter in $M_{BH}-\sigma_*$
relation. The Eddington ratios of all of the rSMBH candidates are larger than

Electron density in the narrow line region of the H II rSMBH candidates is
about 1/10 of that in AGN rSMBH candidates probably because AGN in the former

changes in the magnetic field inclination in the penumbra, with the vertical
field actually changing sign near the penumbral edge, while the total magnetic

the properties of quantum systems. This realisation led to the development of
topological band theory, where, in addition to band index and quasimomentum,
Bloch bands are also characterised by a set of topological invariants. This
topological theory can be readily extended to periodically-driven systems. In
the limit of fast driving, the topology of the system can still be captured by
the topological invariants used to describe static systems. In the limit of
slow driving, however, situations can arise where standard topological
invariants are zero, but yet, topologically protected edge modes are still
observed. These ""anomalous"" topological edge modes have no static analogue, and
are associated with a distinct topological invariant, which takes into account
the full time-evolution over a driving period. Here we demonstrate the first
experimental observation of such anomalous topological edge modes in an
ultrafast-laser-inscribed photonic lattice. This inscription technique allows
one to address each bond of a lattice independently and dynamically, generating
a rich band structure with robust anomalous chiral edge modes and the potential
for perfectly localised bulk states.

instability provides in this case plausible limitations for the temperature
anisotropy of the thermal (core) populations of both the electron and proton

from a first-order theory for conditions specific to the suprathermal electrons

the electron firehose instability may be exclusively controlled by the
suprathermals. The instability is found to be systematically stimulated by the

In this picture, each small Hilbert space can be physically interpreted as
extracting from the full theory specific degrees of freedom. This allows to
reduce the quantization of a classical field theory to the quantization of

dimensions, it can outperform higher dimensional crystals on some measures.
This includes allowing only negative refraction over large frequency ranges and
serving as a near-omnidirectional high-pass filter up to a large frequency
value. First we provide a theoretical discussion on the salient characteristics
of the dispersion relation of a laminate and formulate the solution of an
interface problem by the application of the normal mode decomposition
technique. We present a methodology with which to induce a pure negative
refraction in the laminate. As a corollary to our approach of negative
refraction, we show how the laminate can be used to steer beams over large
angles for small changes in the incident angles (beam steering). Furthermore,
we clarify how the transmitted modes in the laminate can be switched on and off
by varying the angle of the incident wave by a small amount. Finally, we show
that the laminate can be used as a remarkably efficient high-pass frequency
filter. An appropriately designed laminate will reflect all plane waves from
quasi-static to a large frequency, incident at it from all angles except for a
small set of near-normal incidences. This will be true even if the homogeneous
medium is impedance matched with the laminate. Due to the similarities between
SH waves and EM waves it is expected that some or all of these results may also
apply to EM waves in a layered periodic dielectric.

spin tune is energy independent but is equal to zero instead of one half. The
figure-8 topology eliminates the effect of arcs on the spin motion. There
appears a unique opportunity to control the polarization of any particle
species including deuterons, using longitudinal fields of small integrated
strength (weak solenoids). Contrary to existing schemes, using weak solenoids
in figure-8 colliders, one can control the polarization at the interaction
points without essentially any effect on the beam's orbital characteristics. A
universal scheme for control of the polarization using weak solenoids provides
an elegant solution to the problem of ion acceleration completely eliminating
resonant beam depolarization. It allows one to easily adjust the polarization
in any direction at any orbital location, which becomes necessary when
transferring the beam from one ring into another or when measuring the
polarization by polarimeters. It also allows for an easy manipulation of the
spin direction at an interaction point during an experiment. The latter feature
allows one to set up a spin-flipping system with a spin reversal time of less
than a second. By compensating the coherent part of the zero-integer spin
resonance strength, which arises due to errors in alignment of the magnetic
element of the lattice, one can reduce the field integrals of the control
solenoids by a few orders of magnitude.

  Recurrent Neural Networks","2016 ECCV Conference",,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Human action recognition from well-segmented 3D skeleton data has been
intensively studied and has been attracting an increasing attention. Online
action detection goes one step further and is more challenging, which
identifies the action type and localizes the action positions on the fly from
the untrimmed stream data. In this paper, we study the problem of online action
detection from streaming skeleton data. We propose a multi-task end-to-end
Joint Classification-Regression Recurrent Neural Network to better explore the
action type and temporal localization information. By employing a joint
classification and regression optimization objective, this network is capable
of automatically localizing the start and end points of actions more
accurately. Specifically, by leveraging the merits of the deep Long Short-Term
Memory (LSTM) subnetwork, the proposed model automatically captures the complex
long-range temporal dynamics, which naturally avoids the typical sliding window
design and thus ensures high computational efficiency. Furthermore, the subtask
of regression optimization provides the ability to forecast the action prior to
its occurrence. To evaluate our proposed model, we build a large streaming
video dataset with annotations. Experimental results on our dataset and the
public G3D dataset both demonstrate very promising performance of our scheme.

We consider the possibility of having an extremal configuration with one
degenerate event horizon and compare different sizes of black hole remnants. As
a result, once the magnetic charge $g$ of the noncommutative Bardeen solution
becomes larger, both the minimal nonzero mass $M_0$ and the minimal nonzero
horizon radius $r_0$ get larger. This means, subsequently, under the condition
of an adequate amount of $g$, the three parameters $g$, $M_0$, and $r_0$ are in
a connection with each other linearly. According to our results, a
noncommutative Bardeen black hole is colder than the noncommutative
Schwarzschild black hole and its remnant is bigger, so the minimum required
energy for the formation of such a black hole at particle colliders will be
larger. We also find a closely similar result for the Hayward solution.

stability regions. However, mean motion resonances can provide phase protection
and orbits with long-term stability exist. We construct maps of dynamical
stability based on the computation of chaotic indicators and we figure out
regions in phase space, where the long-term stability is guaranteed. We focus
on regions where at least one planet is highly eccentric and attempt to
associate them with the existence of stable periodic orbits. The values of the
orbital elements, which are derived from observational data, are often given
with very large deviations. Generally, phase space regions of high
eccentricities are narrow and thus, our dynamical analysis may restrict
considerably the valid domain of the system's location.

transportation demand in large cities. The understanding of passenger route
choice is critical for public transit management. The wide deployment of
Automated Fare Collection(AFC) systems opens up a new opportunity. However,
only each trip's tap-in and tap-out timestamp and stations can be directly
obtained from AFC system records; the train and route chosen by a passenger are
unknown, which are necessary to solve our problem. While existing methods work
well in some specific situations, they don't work for complicated situations.
In this paper, we propose a solution that needs no additional equipment or
human involvement than the AFC systems. We develop a probabilistic model that
can estimate from empirical analysis how the passenger flows are dispatched to
different routes and trains. We validate our approach using a large scale data
set collected from the Shenzhen metro system. The measured results provide us
with useful inputs when building the passenger path choice model.
