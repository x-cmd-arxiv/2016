${\rm AC}^0$. It is known, by works of Tarui (Theoret. Comput. Sci. 1993) and
Beigel, Reingold, and Spielman (Proc. $6$th CCC, 1991), that any ${\rm AC}^0$
circuit of size $s$ and depth $d$ has an $\varepsilon$-error probabilistic
polynomial over the reals of degree $(\log (s/\varepsilon))^{O(d)}$. We improve
this upper bound to $(\log s)^{O(d)}\cdot \log(1/\varepsilon)$, which is much
better for small values of $\varepsilon$.
  We give an application of this result by using it to resolve a question posed
by Tal (ECCC 2014): we show that $(\log s)^{O(d)}\cdot
\log(1/\varepsilon)$-wise independence fools ${\rm AC}^0$, improving on Tal's
strengthening of Braverman's theorem (J. ACM, 2010) that $(\log
(s/\varepsilon))^{O(d)}$-wise independence fools ${\rm AC}^0$. Up to the
constant implicit in the $O(d)$, our result is tight. As far as we know, this
is the first PRG construction for ${\rm AC}^0$ that achieves optimal dependence
on the error $\varepsilon$.
  We also prove lower bounds on the best polynomial approximations to ${\rm
AC}^0$. We show that any polynomial approximating the ${\rm OR}$ function on
$n$ bits to a small constant error must have degree at least
$\widetilde{\Omega}(\sqrt{\log n})$. This result improves exponentially on a
recent lower bound demonstrated by Meka, Nguyen, and Vu (arXiv 2015).

thought, and their consistent simultaneous treatment is crucial for obtaining
correct physical answers. In particular, I identify a gauge invariance in the
theory, whereby the energies associated to strain-gradient elasticity and
flexoelectrically induced electric fields are individually reference-dependent,
and only when summed up they yield a well-defined result. To illustrate this, I
construct a minimal thermodynamic functional incorporating strain-gradient
effects, and establish a formal link between the continuum description and ab
initio phonon dispersion curves to calculate the relevant tensor quantities. As
a practical demonstration, I apply such a formalism to bulk SrTiO$_3$, where I
find an unusually strong contribution of nonlocal elasticity, mediated by the
interaction between the ferroelectric soft mode and the transverse acoustic
branches. These results have important implications towards the construction of
well-defined thermodynamic theories where flexoelectricity and ferroelectricity
coexist. More generally, they open exciting new avenues for the implementation

be strongly modified if they interact in the near field where electromagnetic
coupling occurs across gaps narrower than the dominant wavelength of thermal

that ultra-thin films of plasmonic materials can be used to dramatically
enhance near-field heat transfer. The total spectrally integrated film-to-film
heat transfer is over an order of magnitude larger than between the same
materials in bulk form and also exceeds the levels achievable with polar
dielectrics such as SiC. We attribute this enhancement to the significant
spectral broadening of radiative heat transfer due to coupling between surface
plasmon polaritons (SPPs) on both sides of each thin film. We show that the
radiative heat flux spectrum can be further shaped by the choice of the
substrate onto which the thin film is deposited. In particular, substrates
supporting surface phonon polaritons (SPhP) strongly modify the heat flux
spectrum owing to the interactions between SPPs on thin films and SPhPs of the
substrate. The use of thin film phase change materials on polar dielectric
substrates allows for dynamic switching of the heat flux spectrum between
SPP-mediated and SPhP-mediated peaks.

produce high-energy neutrinos up to $\sim100$ TeV energies, but CRs from HNRs

around 30 TeV remain unexplained, which might suggest a different population of
gamma-ray dark CR sources. Alternatively, we consider possible contributions of

seen from the XRT and simultaneously with the AIA. The wave appears after a
micro-flare occurs at one of the footpoints. We estimate the density and the
temperature of the loop plasma by performing DEM analysis on the AIA image
sequence. The estimated speed of propagation is comparable or lower than the
local sound speed suggesting it to be a propagating slow wave. The intensity
perturbation amplitudes, in every case, falls very rapidly as the perturbation
moves along the loop and eventually vanishes after one or more reflections. To
check the consistency of such reflection signatures with the obtained loop
parameters, we perform a 2.5D MHD simulation, which uses the parameters
obtained from our observation as inputs and performed forward modelling to
synthesize AIA 94~\r{A} images. Analyzing the synthesized images, we obtain the
same properties of the observables as for the real observation. From the
analysis we conclude that a footpoint heating can generate slow wave which then
reflects back and forth in the coronal loop before fading out. Our analysis on

It has been shown earlier that for non-degenerate harmonic interactions these
systems thermalize, and the dominant part of the correlations is given by local
thermal equilibrium determined by a temperature profile which satisfies a
linear heat equation. Here we are concerned with two new aspects about the
thermalization process: the first order corrections in $1/L$ to the local
equilibrium correlations and the applicability of kinetic theory to study the
relaxation process. Employing previously derived explicit uniform estimates for
the temperature profile, we first derive an explicit form for the first order
corrections to the particle position-momentum correlations. By suitably
revising the definition of the Wigner transform and the kinetic scaling limit
we derive a phonon Boltzmann equation whose predictions agree with the explicit

arising from two different sources: a current-related term and a correction to
the position-position correlations related to spatial changes in the phonon

settle on one of multiple discrete alternative choices, with the relevance of
their would-be choices continuously impacted by noise and the unfolding group
behavior. This class of problems is modeled here as a so-called Min-LQG game,
i.e., a linear quadratic Gaussian dynamic and non-cooperative game, with an
additional combinatorial aspect in that it includes a final choice-related
minimization in its terminal cost. The presence of this minimization term is
key to enforcing some specific discrete choice by each individual agent. The
theory of mean field games is invoked to generate a class of decentralized
agent feedback control strategies which are then shown to converge to an exact
Nash equilibrium of the game as the number of players increases to infinity. A
key building block in our approach is an explicit solution to the problem of
computing the best response of a generic agent to some arbitrarily posited
smooth mean field trajectory. Ultimately, an agent is shown to face a
continuously revised discrete choice problem, where greedy choices dictated by
current conditions must be constantly balanced against the risk of the future
process noise upsetting the wisdom of such decisions.Even though an agent's
ultimately chosen alternative is random and dictated by its entire noise
history and initial state, the limiting infinite population macroscopic
behavior can still be predicted. It is shown that any Nash equilibrium of the

with various improvements over previous efforts. These are then evaluated
numerically by comparison to a complicated but analytically known rotation that
is motivated by the important astrophysical problem of precessing black-hole
binaries. It is shown that a straightforward solution directly using
quaternions is most efficient and accurate, and that the norm of the quaternion
is irrelevant. Integration of the generator of the rotation can also be made
roughly as efficient as integration of the rotation. Both methods will
typically be twice as efficient as naive vector- or matrix-based methods.
Implementation by means of standard general-purpose numerical integrators is

tensor-valued functions on the sphere. A tensor field can be decomposed into
complex-valued functions by taking contractions with tangent vectors on the
sphere and the normal to the sphere. These component functions are usually
presented as functions on the sphere itself, but this requires an implicit
choice of distinguished tangent vectors with which to contract. Thus, we may
more accurately say that spin-weighted spherical functions are functions of
both a point on the sphere and a choice of frame in the tangent space at that
point. The distinction becomes extremely important when transforming the
coordinates in which these functions are expressed, because the implicit choice
of frame will also transform. Here, it is proposed that spin-weighted spherical
functions should be treated as functions on the spin group. This approach more
cleanly reflects the geometry involved, and allows for a more elegant
description of the behavior of spin-weighted functions. In this form, the
spin-weighted spherical harmonics have simple expressions as elements of the
Wigner $\mathfrak{D}$ representations, and transformations under rotation are
simple. Two variants of the angular-momentum operator are defined directly in
terms of the spin group; one is the standard angular-momentum operator
$\mathbf{L}$, while the other is shown to be related to the spin-raising
operator $\eth$. Computer code is also included, providing an explicit
implementation of the spin-weighted spherical harmonics in this form.

Experimental observables including the mean-square charge radius, as well as

the $Z_8$ corresponds to known states obtained from non-interacting electrons,

allowing straightforward expression of common requirements patterns in formal
languages. In this work we demonstrate how we support real-time specification

this framework has the exceptional feature that the neutrino oscillation
probability in matter has the same structure as in vacuum, to all orders in the
expansion parameter. It also contains all orders in the matter potential and
$\sin\theta_{13}$. It facilitates immediate physical interpretation of the
analytic results, and makes the expressions for the neutrino oscillation
probabilities extremely compact and very accurate even at zeroth order in our
perturbative expansion. The first and second order results are also given which
improve the precision by approximately two or more orders of magnitude per

The
combined problem of turbulence and cloud droplet growth is numerically
challenging. Here, an Eulerian scheme based on the Smoluchowski equation is
compared with two Lagrangian superparticle (or su- perdroplet) schemes in the
presence of condensation and collection. The growth processes are studied
either separately or in combination using either two-dimensional turbulence, a
steady flow, or just gravitational acceleration without gas flow. Good
agreement between the differ- ent schemes for the time evolution of the size
spectra is observed in the presence of gravity or turbulence. Higher moments of
the size spectra are found to be a useful tool to characterize the growth of
the largest drops through collection. Remarkably, the tails of the size spectra
are reasonably well described by a gamma distribution in cases with gravity or
turbulence. The Lagrangian schemes are generally found to be superior over the
Eulerian one in terms of computational performance. However, it is shown that
the use of interpolation schemes such as the cloud-in-cell algorithm is
detrimental in connection with superparticle or superdroplet approaches.
Furthermore, the use of symmetric over asymmetric collection schemes is shown
to reduce the amount of scatter in the results.

the non-adaptive setting in which the marketer is supposed to select all of the

this setting is that the marketer is forced to select all the seeds based
solely on a diffusion model. If some of the selected seeds do not perform well,
there is no opportunity to course-correct. A more practical setting is the
adaptive setting in which the marketer initially selects a batch of users and
observes how well seeding those users leads to a diffusion of product
adoptions. Based on this market feedback, she formulates a policy for choosing
the remaining seeds. In this paper, we study adaptive offline strategies for
two problems: (a) MAXSPREAD -- given a budget on number of seeds and a time
horizon, maximize the spread of influence and (b) MINTSS -- given a time
horizon and an expected number of target users to be influenced, minimize the
number of seeds that will be required. In particular, we present theoretical
bounds and empirical results for an adaptive strategy and quantify its
practical benefit over the non-adaptive strategy. We evaluate adaptive and
non-adaptive policies on three real data sets. We conclude that while benefit
of going adaptive for the MAXSPREAD problem is modest, adaptive policies lead
to significant savings for the MINTSS problem.

observed statistics are almost perfect, which makes them unsuitable for
practical applications. Practically relevant self-testing bounds are much less

for proving analytic self-testing bounds of practically relevant robustness. We
obtain improved bounds for the case of self-testing the singlet using the CHSH
inequality (in particular we show that non-trivial fidelity with the singlet
can be achieved as long as the violation exceeds $\beta^{*} = (16 + 14

using the Mermin inequality we derive a bound which not only improves on

them to independently verify the resonant population models from the
Canada-France Ecliptic Plane Survey (CFEPS; Gladman et al. 2012), with which we
find broad agreement. We confirm that the 5:2 resonance is more populated than
models of the outer Solar System's dynamical history predict; our minimum
population estimate shows that the high eccentricity (e>0.35) portion of the
resonance is at least as populous as the 2:1 and possibly as populated as the
3:2 resonance. One OSSOS block was well-suited to detecting objects trapped at
low libration amplitudes in Neptune's 3:2 resonance, a population of interest
in testing the origins of resonant TNOs. We detected three 3:2 objects with
libration amplitudes below the cutoff modeled by CFEPS; OSSOS thus offers new
constraints on this distribution. The OSSOS detections confirm that the 2:1
resonance has a dynamically colder inclination distribution than either the 3:2
or 5:2 resonances. Using the combined OSSOS and CFEPS 2:1 detections, we
constrain the fraction of 2:1 objects in the symmetric mode of libration to be
0.2-0.85; we also constrain the fraction of leading vs. trailing asymmetric
librators, which has been theoretically predicted to vary depending on
Neptune's migration history, to be 0.05-0.8. Future OSSOS blocks will improve

This scheme caches each content in multiple layers, and it is optimized by
solving two subproblems: lossless caching of each layer with heterogeneous
cache capacities, and allocation of available caches among layers. The delivery
rate minimization problem for each layer is solved numerically, while two
schemes, called the proportional cache allocation (PCA) and ordered cache
allocation (OCA), are proposed for cache allocation. These schemes are compared

result immediately conducts us to question if other measures from quantum
information theory can explain the characteristic release of energy in a short
time interval. In this work we identify the uncertainty of purely quantum
origin as the property responsible for Dicke superradiance. The quantum
uncertainty on the population of each emitter of the sample captured by the
Wigner-Yanase skew information (WYSI) is proportional to the correlation
radiation rate, which is the part of the total radiated power coming from
dipole correlations and responsible for releasing in a short time a great
intensity of radiation energy. We also show that the correlation measure called
local quantum uncertainty, which is the minimization of the WYSI over all local
observables, presents a double sudden change induced by environment. The time
window between these two sudden changes is used to define the interval in which
symmetric global observables of the system behave classically for $N

wasted. Energy storage facility may provide some recourse against the

approaches have been proposed. We analyze the management of a network composed
of conventional power units as well as wind turbines through approximate
dynamic programming. We consider a general power network model with ramping
constraints on the conventional generators. We use generalized linear
programming techniques to linearize the problems. We test the algorithm on
several networks of different sizes and report results about the computation

information theory. It is well known that entanglement with an ancillary system
can help in this task, and furthermore that an ancilla with the same dimension
as the input of the channels is always sufficient for optimal discrimination of
two channels. A natural question to ask is whether the same holds true for the
output dimension. That is, in cases when the output dimension of the channels
is (possibly much) smaller than the input dimension, is an ancilla with
dimension equal to the output dimension always sufficient for optimal
discrimination? We show that the answer to this question is ""no"" by
construction of a family of counterexamples. This family contains instances
with arbitrary finite gap between the input and output dimensions, and still
has the property that in every case, for optimal discrimination, it is
necessary to use an ancilla with dimension equal to that of the input.
  The proof relies on a characterization of all operators on the trace norm
unit sphere that maximize entanglement negativity. In the case of density
operators we generalize this characterization to a broad class of entanglement
measures, which we call weak entanglement measures. This characterization
allows us to conclude that a quantum channel is reversible if and only if it
preserves entanglement as measured by any weak entanglement measure, with the
structure of maximally entangled states being equivalent to the structure of
reversible maps via the Choi isomorphism. We also include alternate proofs of
other known characterizations of channel reversibility.

condensed matter physics1. Despite the tremendous efforts in exploring the
topological superconductivity, its presence is however still under heavy
debates. The Dirac electrons are supposed to exist in a thin layer of the
surface of a topological insulator. Due to the finite spin-orbital coupling,
these electrons will have a spin-momentum locking effect. In this case, the
superfluid with the spin singlet Cooper pairing is not completely comforted by
the Dirac electrons. It thus remains unclear whether and how the Dirac
electrons fall into Cooper pairing in an intrinsic superconductor with the
topological surface states. In this work, we show the systematic study of
scanning tunneling microscope/spectroscopy on the possible topological
superconductor SrxBi2Se3. We first show that only the intercalated (or
inserted), not the substituted Sr atoms can induce superconductivity. Then we
show the full superconducting gaps without any abnormal in-gap density of
states as expected theoretically for the bulk topological superconductivity.
However, we find that the surface Dirac electrons will simultaneously condense
into the superconducting state when the energy is smaller than the bulk
superconducting gap. This vividly demonstrates how the surface Dirac electrons
are driven into Cooper pairs.

(DNNs) for solving complex classification tasks is yet to be fully exploited.
The most limiting factor is that DNNs as notorious 'black boxes' do not provide
insight into neurophysiological phenomena underlying a decision. Layer-wise
Relevance Propagation (LRP) has been introduced as a novel method to explain
individual network decisions. New Method: We propose the application of DNNs
with LRP for the first time for EEG data analysis. Through LRP the single-trial
DNN decisions are transformed into heatmaps indicating each data point's
relevance for the outcome of the decision. Results: DNN achieves classification
accuracies comparable to those of CSP-LDA. In subjects with low performance
subject-to-subject transfer of trained DNNs can improve the results. The
single-trial LRP heatmaps reveal neurophysiologically plausible patterns,
resembling CSP-derived scalp maps. Critically, while CSP patterns represent
class-wise aggregated information, LRP heatmaps pinpoint neural patterns to
single time points in single trials. Comparison with Existing Method(s): We
compare the classification performance of DNNs to that of linear CSP-LDA on two
data sets related to motor-imaginery BCI. Conclusion: We have demonstrated that
DNN is a powerful non-linear tool for EEG analysis. With LRP a new quality of
high-resolution assessment of neural activity can be reached. LRP is a
potential remedy for the lack of interpretability of DNNs that has limited
their utility in neuroscientific applications. The extreme specificity of the
LRP-derived heatmaps opens up new avenues for investigating neural activity
underlying complex perception or decision-related processes.

couplings with matter fields in D dimensions. These charged black hole
solutions exhibit a backreacting scalar field configuration that is regular

140 days after the prompt. The multiwavelength light curve from 500 s to 140

additional component to reproduce the early X-ray and optical emission. We
present TNG and LBT optical observations performed 19.6, 33.9 and 92.3 days
after the trigger which show a bump with respect to a standard afterglow flux
decay and are possibly interpreted as due to the underlying SN and host galaxy
(of 0.4 uJy in the R band). Radio observations, performed with SRT, Medicina,
EVN and VLBA between day 4 and 140, suggest that the burst exploded in an
environment characterised by a density profile scaling with the distance from
the source (wind profile). A remarkable feature of the prompt emission is the
presence of a bright flare 100 s after the trigger, lasting 70 seconds in the
soft X-ray band, which was simultaneously detected from the optical band up to
the MeV energy range. By combining Swift-BAT/XRT and Fermi-GBM data, the
broadband (0.3-1000 keV) time resolved spectral analysis of the flare reveals
the coexistence of a non-thermal (power law) and thermal blackbody components.
The BB component contributes up to 35% of the luminosity in the 0.3-1000 keV
band. The gamma-ray emission observed in Swift-BAT and Fermi-GBM anticipates
and lasts less than the soft X-ray emission as observed by Swift-XRT, arguing
against a Comptonization origin. The BB component could either be produced by
an outflow becoming transparent or by the collision of a fast shell with a
slow, heavy and optically thick fireball ejected during the quiescent time
interval between the initial and later flares of the burst.

of selected galaxies forming in the $\Lambda$CDM cosmology with a 40 times
better mass resolution than in the parent large-scale hydrodynamical Illustris
simulation. We here focus on the starburst properties of the gas in four
cosmological simulations of major mergers. The galaxies in our high-resolution
zoom runs exhibit a bursty mode of star formation with gas consumption
timescales 10 times shorter than for the normal star formation mode. The strong
bursts are only present in the simulations with the highest resolution, hinting
that a too low resolution is the reason why the original Illustris simulation
showed a dearth of starburst galaxies. Very pronounced bursts of star formation
occur in two out of four major mergers we study. The high star formation rates,
the short gas consumption timescales and the morphology of these systems
strongly resemble observed nuclear starbursts. This is the first time that a
sample of major mergers is studied through self-consistent cosmological
hydrodynamical simulations instead of using isolated galaxy models setup on a
collision course. We also study the orbits of the colliding galaxies and find
that the starbursting gas preferentially appears in head-on mergers with very
high collision velocities. Encounters with large impact parameters do typically
not lead to the formation of starbursting gas.

the host galaxies of all superluminous supernovae (SLSNe) discovered by the
Palomar Transient Factory prior to 2013, and derive measurements of their
luminosities, star-formation rates, stellar masses, and gas-phase
metallicities. We find that Type I (hydrogen-poor) SLSNe are found almost
exclusively in low-mass (M < 2x10^9 M_sun) and metal-poor (12+log[O/H] < 8.4)
galaxies. We compare the mass and metallicity distributions of our sample to
nearby galaxy catalogs in detail and conclude that the rate of SLSNe-I as a
fraction of all SNe is heavily suppressed in galaxies with metallicities >0.5
Z_sun. Extremely low metallicities are not required, and indeed provide no
further increase in the relative SLSN rate. Several SLSN-I hosts are undergoing
vigorous starbursts, but this may simply be a side effect of metallicity
dependence: dwarf galaxies tend to have bursty star-formation histories.
Type-II (hydrogen-rich) SLSNe are found over the entire range of galaxy masses
and metallicities, and their integrated properties do not suggest a strong
preference for (or against) low-mass/low-metallicity galaxies. Two hosts
exhibit unusual properties: PTF 10uhf is a Type I SLSN in a massive, luminous
infrared galaxy at redshift z=0.29, while PTF 10tpz is a Type II SLSN located
in the nucleus of an early-type host at z=0.04.

having narrower, more symmetric line profiles. This prediction is qualitatively

active galactic nuclei (AGN) evolution stretching back to $z \sim 5$. However,
it has been challenging to use the survey results to connect this evolution to
the cosmological environment that AGNs inhabit. Exploring this connection will
be crucial to understanding the triggering mechanisms of AGNs and how these
processes manifest in observations at all wavelengths. In anticipation of
upcoming wide-field X-ray surveys that will allow quantitative analysis of AGN
environments, this paper presents a method to observationally constrain the
Conditional Luminosity Function (CLF) of AGNs at a specific $z$. Once measured,
the CLF allows the calculation of the AGN bias, mean dark matter halo mass, AGN
lifetime, halo occupation number, and AGN correlation function -- all as a
function of luminosity. The CLF can be constrained using a measurement of the
X-ray luminosity function and the correlation length at different luminosities.
The method is illustrated at $z \approx 0$ and $0.9$ using the limited data
that is currently available, and a clear luminosity dependence in the AGN bias
and mean halo mass is predicted at both $z$, supporting the idea that there are
at least two different modes of AGN triggering. In addition, the CLF predicts
that $z\approx 0.9$ quasars may be commonly hosted by haloes with
$M_{\mathrm{h}} \sim 10^{14}$ M$_{\odot}$. These `young cluster' environments
may provide the necessary interactions between gas-rich galaxies to fuel
luminous accretion. The results derived from this method will be useful to
populate AGNs of different luminosities in cosmological simulations.

posits that the principle difference between obscured (Type 2) and unobscured
(Type 1) AGNs is the line-of-sight into the central engine. If this model is
correct than there should be no difference in many of the properties of AGN
host galaxies (e.g., the mass of the surrounding dark matter haloes). However,
recent clustering analyses of Type 1 and Type 2 AGNs have provided some
evidence for a difference in the halo mass, in conflict with the
orientation-based unified model. In this work, a method to compute the
Conditional Luminosity Function (CLF) of Type 2 and Type 1 AGNs is presented.
The CLF allows many fundamental halo properties to be computed as a function of
AGN luminosity, which we apply to the question of the host halo masses of Type
1 and 2 AGNs. By making use of the total AGN CLF, the Type 1 X-ray luminosity
function, and the luminosity-dependent Type 2 AGN fraction, the CLFs of Type 1
and 2 AGNs are calculated at $z\approx 0$ and $0.9$. At both $z$, there is no
statistically significant difference in the mean halo mass of Type 2 and 1 AGNs
at any luminosity. There is marginal evidence that Type 1 AGNs may have larger
halo masses than Type 2s, which would be consistent with an evolutionary
picture where quasars are initially obscured and then subsequently reveal
themselves as Type 1s. As the Type 1 lifetime is longer, the host halo will
increase somewhat in mass during the Type 1 phase. The CLF technique will be a
powerful way to study the properties of many AGNs subsets (e.g., radio-loud,
Compton-thick) as future wide-area X-ray and optical surveys substantially
increase our ability to place AGNs in their cosmological context.

in copying these networks, the representational space is not learnt from the

provide less supervision and require meticulous regularization, smaller and
careful tweaking of learning rates to even achieve stable learning without

accuracies than networks trained with common regularization techniques such as

`normal' clusters. The gas mass fraction profiles exhibit striking variation in
the inner regions, but converge to approximately the cosmic baryon fraction
(corrected for depletion) at R500. Beyond R500 the gas mass fraction profiles
again diverge, which we interpret as being due to a difference in gas clumping
and/or a breakdown of hydrostatic equilibrium in the external regions. Overall
our observations point to considerable radial variation in the hot gas content
and in the gas clumping and/or hydrostatic equilibrium properties in these
fossil clusters, at odds with the interpretation of their being old, evolved
and undisturbed. At least some fossil objects appear to be dynamically young.

Given any arbitrary $(n,k,d)$ values, whether there exists an intelligent
helper selection scheme (assuming unlimited memory and computing power) that
can strictly improve the storage-bandwidth (S-B) tradeoff. Ahmad et al. 18'
answered this question by proving that for a subset of $(n,k,d)$ values, no
helper selection scheme can ever improve the S-B tradeoff, and for the
$(n,k,d)$ not in that subset, a new scheme called family helper selection (FHS)
can strictly improve the S-B tradeoff over a blind helper selection scheme.
Nonetheless, the analysis of FHS is done by a min-cut analysis with no actual
code construction.
  This work fills this gap between pure min-cut analysis and actual code
construction by pairing FHS with a new, generalized version of the existing
fractional repetition (FR) codes. Specifically, existing FR codes are
exact-repair codes that admit the highly-desirable repair-by-transfer property,
but its unique construction limits the application to a restricted set of
$(n,k,d)$ values. In contrast, our new construction, termed flexible fractional

the practical benefits of FR codes, i.e., admitting small repair bandwidth,
being exact-repair, and being almost repairable-by-transfer.

distributed storage networks. Initially, the analysis of RCs was based on the
assumption that during the repair process, the newcomer does not distinguish
(among all surviving nodes) which nodes to access, i.e., the newcomer is
oblivious to the set of helpers being used. Such a scheme is termed the blind
helper selection (BHS) scheme. Nonetheless, it is intuitive in practice that
the newcomer should choose to access only those ""good"" helpers. In this
two-part paper, a new characterization of the effect of choosing the helper
nodes in terms of the storage-bandwidth tradeoff is given. Specifically, the
answer to the following fundamental question is provided: Under what condition
does proactively choosing the helper nodes improve the storage-bandwidth
tradeoff?
  Through a graph-based analysis, this Part I paper answers this question by
providing a necessary and sufficient condition under which optimally choosing
good helpers strictly improves the storage-bandwidth tradeoff. A low-complexity
helper selection solution, termed the family helper selection (FHS) scheme, is
proposed and the corresponding storage/repair-bandwidth curve is characterized.
This Part I paper also proves that under some design parameters, the FHS scheme
is indeed optimal among all helper selection schemes. In the Part II paper, an
explicit construction of an exact-repair code is proposed that achieves the
minimum-bandwidth-regenerating (MBR) point of the FHS scheme. The new
exact-repair code can be viewed as a generalization of the existing fractional
repetition code.

been a major open problem for decades and apart from pseudopolynomial
algorithms there is no algorithm that solves any non-trivial subclass in

  In this paper, we give several results based on the weight structures of the

facet algorithms, require at least sub-exponential time. Our main technique is
developing the first non-trivial approximation algorithm and showing how to
convert it to an exact algorithm. Moreover, we show that in a practical case in
verification where weights are clustered around a constant number of values,
the energy game problem can be solved in polynomial time. We also show that the
problem is still as hard as in general when the clique-width is bounded or the
graph is strongly ergodic, suggesting that restricting the graph structure does

stellar feedback. We show that for galaxies with virial masses

This failure occurs due to a shutdown of galactic winds, with wind mass
loadings falling from $\eta\sim10$ to $\eta<1$. In more massive systems, this
transfer of baryons to the circumgalactic medium falters earlier on and the
galaxies diverge significantly from observed galaxy scaling relations and
morphologies. The decreasing efficiency is simply due to a deepening potential
well preventing gas escape. This implies that non-supernova feedback mechanisms
must become dominant for galaxies with stellar masses greater than
$\sim4\times10^{10}\;M_\odot$. The runaway growth of the central stellar bulge,
strongly linked to black hole growth, suggests that feedback from active
galactic nuclei is the probable mechanism. Below this mass, supernovae alone
are able to produce a realistic stellar mass fraction, star formation history

studied. This is motivated by the fact that early detection of diseases such as
cancer play a crucial role in their successful treatment. The proposed NADS is
in fact a two-tier network of sensor nano-machines (SNMs) in the first tier and
a data-gathering node (DGN) at the sink. The SNMs detect the presence of
competitor cells (abnormality) by variations in input and/or parameters of a
nano-communications channel (NCC). The noise of SNMs as their nature suggest is
considered correlated in time and space and herein assumed additive Gaussian.
In the second step, the SNMs transmit micro-scale messages over a noisy micro
communications channel (MCC) to the DGN, where a decision is made upon fusing
the received signals. We find an optimum design of detectors for each of the
NADS tiers based on the end-to-end NADS performance. The detection performance
of each SNM is analyzed by setting up a generalized likelihood ratio test.
Next, taking into account the effect of the MCC, the overall performance of the
NADS is analyzed in terms of probabilities of misdetection and false alarm. In
addition, computationally efficient expressions to quantify the NADS
performance is derived by providing respectively an approximation and an upper
bound for the probabilities of misdetection and false alarm. This in turn
enables formulating a design problem, where the optimized concentration of SNMs
in a sample is obtained for a high probability of detection and a limited
probability of false alarm. The results indicate that otherwise ignoring the
spatial and temporal correlation of SNM noise in the analysis, leads to an NADS

applicative $\lambda$-calculus and is universal for computations over infinite

the refinement induced by linear logic allows to restrict both modalities so as
to get calculi which are terminating inductively and productive coinductively.
We exemplify this idea by analysing a fragment of $\ell\Lambda$ built around
the principles of $\mathsf{SLL}$ and $\mathsf{4LL}$. Interestingly, it enjoys
confluence, contrarily to what happens in ordinary infinitary

fluids at mesoscopic scales. Here we use this approach to study the
fluctuations of the hydrodynamic variables of a thermotropic nematic liquid
crystal (NLC) in a nonequilibrium steady state (NESS). This state is induced by
an externally imposed temperature gradient and a uniform gravity field. We
calculate analytically both, the equilibrium and nonequilibrium hydrodynamic
modes. We find that in this NESS the nonequilibrium effects produced by the
external gradients only affect the longitudinal variables. This gives rise to a
pair of sound modes, one orientation mode of the director and two visco-heat
modes formed by the coupling of the shear and thermal modes. We also find that
the last three modes exhibit the largest changes. The analytical expressions
that we have found for the visco-heat modes imply that the heat and shear modes
of the NLC are coupled, that they reduce to those of simple fluid in the
isotropic limit and that these modes may become propagative, a feature that
also occurs in the simple fluid. In the isotropic limit of the nematic our
results also reduce to the hydrodynamic modes of a simple fluid in the presence
of the same temperature gradient and the pressure gradient produced by the

electron temperature ($T_e/e$) below the plasma potential, (B) an electrode

nearly at the plasma potential, (D) an electrode biased more than $T_i/2e$ but
less than $T_e/2e$ above the plasma potential, and (E) an electrode biased much
greater than $T_e/2e$ above the plasma potential. In case (A), the electron
velocity distribution function (EVDF) is observed to be Maxwellian with a
Boltzmann-type exponential density decay through the ion sheath and presheath.
In cases (B) and (C), the EVDFs exhibit a loss-cone type truncation due to fast
electrons overcoming the small potential difference between the electrode and
plasma. No sheath is present in this regime, and the plasma remains
quasineutral up to the electrode. The EVDF truncation leads to a presheath-like
density and flow velocity gradient. In case (D) an electron sheath is present,
and essentially all ions are repelled. Here the truncation driven behavior
persists, but is accompanied by a shift in the maximum value of the EVDF that
is not present in the negative bias cases. In case (E), the flow shift becomes
greater and the loss-cone moves further into the tail of the EVDF. In this case
the flow moment has significant contributions from both the flow shift of the
EVDF maximum, and the loss-cone truncation.

astronomy. In order to reach the full scientific potential of
gravitational-wave experiments we require techniques to mitigate the cost of
Bayesian inference, especially as gravitational-wave signal models and analyses
become increasingly sophisticated and detailed. Reduced order models (ROMs) of
gravitational waveforms can significantly reduce the computational cost of
inference by removing redundant computations. In this paper we construct the
first reduced order models of gravitational-wave signals that include the
effects of spin-precession, inspiral, merger, and ringdown in compact object
binaries, and which are valid for component masses describing binary neutron
star, binary black hole and mixed binary systems. This work utilizes the
waveform model known as ""IMRPhenomPv2"". Our ROM enables the use of a fast
reduced order quadrature (ROQ) integration rule which allows us to approximate
Bayesian probability density functions at a greatly reduced computational cost.
We find that the ROQ rule can be used to speed up inference by factors as high
as 300 without introducing systematic bias. This corresponds to a reduction in
computational time from around half a year to a half a day, for the longest
duration/lowest mass signals. The ROM and ROQ rule are available with the main
inference library of the LIGO Scientific Collaboration, LALInference.

surprisingly well in predicting (approximately) subsequent coefficients. These
can then be used by the ratio method to obtain improved estimates of critical
parameters. In favourable cases, given only the first 20 coefficients, the next
100 coefficients are predicted with useful accuracy. More surprisingly, this is
also the case when the method of differential approximants does not do a useful
job in estimating the critical parameters, such as those cases in which one has
stretched exponential asymptotic behaviour. Nevertheless, the coefficients are
predicted with surprising accuracy. As one consequence, significant computer
time can be saved in enumeration problems where several runs would normally be
made, modulo different primes, and the coefficients constructed from their
values modulo different primes. Another is in the checking of newly calculated
coefficients. We believe that this concept of approximate series extension
opens up a whole new chapter in the method of series analysis.

role, and stay voluntarily logged into so-called AA sessions for part of their
time (e.g. 2 hours per day), during which they create periodical logs - short
text sentences - they wish to share about their activity with the team. These
logs are publicly aggregated in a website and are peer-validated after the end
of a session, as in code review. A short screencast is ideally recorded at the
end of each session to make AA logs more understandable. This methodology has
shown to be well-suited for increasing the efficiency of distributed teams
working on Global Software Development (GSD), as observed in our reported
experience in actual real-world situations. This efficiency boost is mainly
achieved through 1) built-in asynchronous on-demand communication in
conjunction with documentation of work, products, and processes, and 2) reduced
need for central management, meetings or time-consuming reports. Hence, the AA
methodology legitimizes and facilitates the activities of a distributed
software team. It thus enables other entities to have a solid means to fund
these activities, allowing for new and concrete business models to emerge for
very distributed software development. AA has been proposed, at its core, as a
way of sustaining self-replicating hacker initiatives. These claims are
discussed in a real case-study of running a distributed free software hacker

reconstruction and calibration due to methods for extracting reliable point
features and key developments in projective geometry. Point features, however,
are not available in certain applications and result in unstructured point
cloud reconstructions. General image curves provide a complementary feature
when keypoints are scarce, and result in 3D curve geometry, but face challenges
not addressed by the usual projective geometry of points and algebraic curves.
We address these challenges by laying the theoretical foundations of a
framework based on the differential geometry of general curves, including
stationary curves, occluding contours, and non-rigid curves, aiming at stereo
correspondence, camera estimation (including calibration, pose, and multiview
epipolar geometry), and 3D reconstruction given measured image curves. By
gathering previous results into a cohesive theory, novel results were made
possible, yielding three contributions. First we derive the differential
geometry of an image curve (tangent, curvature, curvature derivative) from that
of the underlying space curve (tangent, curvature, curvature derivative,
torsion). Second, we derive the differential geometry of a space curve from
that of two corresponding image curves. Third, the differential motion of an
image curve is derived from camera motion and the differential geometry and
motion of the space curve. The availability of such a theory enables novel
curve-based multiview reconstruction and camera estimation systems to augment
existing point-based approaches. This theory has been used to reconstruct a ""3D
curve sketch"", to determine camera pose from local curve geometry, and
tracking; other developments are underway.

homogeneous on the temporal and spatial dimensions over which data is
collected. This is partic- ularly true for laser-produced high-energy-density

ourselves, and represent them in a quantum-like 'extended Bloch representation'
where the Born rule of quantum probability does not necessarily hold. In Part
II we apply this mathematical framework to successfully model question order
effects, response replicability and unpacking effects, thus opening the way
toward quantum cognition beyond Hilbert space.

loss functions such as the average precision (AP) or the normalized discounted

parameters of a retrieval system can be estimated by minimizing these loss
functions. However, the non-differentiability and non-decomposability of these
loss functions does not allow for simple gradient based optimization
algorithms. This issue is generally circumvented by either optimizing a
structured hinge-loss upper bound to the loss function or by using asymptotic
methods like the direct-loss minimization framework. Yet, the high
computational complexity of loss-augmented inference, which is necessary for
both the frameworks, prohibits its use in large training data sets. To
alleviate this deficiency, we present a novel quicksort flavored algorithm for
a large class of non-decomposable loss functions. We provide a complete
characterization of the loss functions that are amenable to our algorithm, and
show that it includes both AP and NDCG based loss functions. Furthermore, we
prove that no comparison based algorithm can improve upon the computational
complexity of our approach asymptotically. We demonstrate the effectiveness of
our approach in the context of optimizing the structured hinge loss upper bound
of AP and NDCG loss for learning models for a variety of vision tasks. We show
that our approach provides significantly better results than simpler
decomposable loss functions, while requiring a comparable training time.

and response of a pseudoknot (PK) RNA to force, a number of single molecule
pulling experiments have been performed on PKs to decipher the mechanism of
programmed ribosomal frameshifting. Motivated in part by these experiments, we
performed simulations using a coarse-grained model of RNA to describe the
response of a PK over a range of mechanical forces ($f$s) and monovalent salt
concentrations ($C$s). The coarse-grained simulations quantitatively reproduce
the multistep thermal melting observed in experiments, thus validating our
model. The free energy changes obtained in simulations are in excellent
agreement with experiments. By varying $f$ and $C$, we calculated the phase
diagram that shows a sequence of structural transitions, populating distinct
intermediate states. As $f$ and $C$ are changed, the stem-loop tertiary
interactions rupture first, followed by unfolding of the $3^{\prime}$-end
hairpin ($\textrm{I}\rightleftharpoons\textrm{F}$). Finally, the
$5^{\prime}$-end hairpin unravels, producing an extended state
($\textrm{E}\rightleftharpoons\textrm{I}$). A theoretical analysis of the phase
boundaries shows that the critical force for rupture scales as $\left(\log
C_{\textrm{m}}\right)^{\alpha}$ with $\alpha=1\,(0.5)$ for
$\textrm{E}\rightleftharpoons\textrm{I}$

obtain the preferential ion-RNA interaction coefficient, which can be

ppb of methane on Mars. This in situ measurement reorients our understanding of
the Martian environment and its potential for life, as the current theories do
not entail any geological source or sink of methane that varies sub-annually.
In particular, the 10-fold elevation during the southern winter indicates
episodic sources of methane that are yet to be discovered. Here we suggest a
near-surface reservoir could explain this variability. Using the temperature
and humidity measurements from the rover, we find that perchlorate salts in the
regolith deliquesce to form liquid solutions, and deliquescence progresses to
deeper subsurface in the season of the methane spikes. We therefore formulate
the following three testable hypotheses. The first scenario is that the
regolith in Gale Crater adsorbs methane when dry and releases this methane to
the atmosphere upon deliquescence. The adsorption energy needs to be 36 kJ/mol
to explain the magnitude of the methane spikes, higher than existing laboratory
measurements. The second scenario is that microorganisms convert organic matter
in the soil to methane when they are in liquid solutions. This scenario does
not require regolith adsorption, but entails extant life on Mars. The third
scenario is that deep subsurface aquifers produce the bursts of methane.
Continued in situ measurements of methane and water, as well as laboratory
studies of adsorption and deliquescence, will test these hypotheses and inform
the existence of the near-surface reservoir and its exchange with the
atmosphere.

This fixed point is also a quantum critical point separating symmetry-protected
topological phases. By tuning the system through resonance, all SPT phases can
be accessed. For a particular interaction strength with Luttinger parameters
$g_\rho=1/3$ and $g_\sigma=1$, we show that the problem is equivalent to a two
channel $SU(3)$ Kondo problem($SU(3)_2$ CFT). At the Toulouse limit, both
problems can be mapped to a quantum Brownian motion model on a Kagome lattice,
which in turn is related to the quantum Brownian motion on a honeycomb lattice
and the three-channel $SU(2)$ Kondo problem($SU(2)_3$ CFT). ""Level-rank

$SU(k)_2$ CFT is also explored. Utilizing the boundary conformal field theory,

wavelengths. Most discs exhibit excess at mid- and far-infrared wavelengths,
analogous to the solar system's Asteroid and Edgeworth-Kuiper belts. Recently,
stars with strong (1 per cent) excess at near-infrared wavelengths were
identified through interferometric measurements. Using the HIgh Precision
Polarimetric Instrument (HIPPI), we examined a sub-sample of these hot dust
stars (and appropriate controls) at parts-per-million sensitivity in SDSS g'
(green) and r' (red) filters for evidence of scattered light. No detection of
strongly polarized emission from the hot dust stars is seen. We therefore rule
out scattered light from a normal debris disk as the origin of this emission. A
wavelength dependent contribution from multiple dust components for hot dust
stars is inferred from the dispersion (difference in polarization angle in red
and green) of southern stars. Contributions of 17 ppm (green) and 30 ppm (red)
are calculated, with strict 3 sigma upper limits of 76 and 68 ppm,
respectively. This suggests weak hot dust excesses consistent with thermal
emission, although we cannot rule out contrived scenarios, e.g. dust in a
spherical shell or face on discs. We also report on the nature of the local
interstellar medium, obtained as a byproduct of the control measurements.
Highlights include the first measurements of the polarimetric colour of the
local interstellar medium and discovery of a southern sky region with a

non-perturbative behavior is classified into two classes: Runaways type I leave
the complex-valued spectrum and become completely real because of eigenvalue
attraction. Runaways type II leave the bulk and move very rapidly in response
to perturbations. These have high condition numbers and can be predicted.
Localization of the eigenvectors are then quantified using entropies and
inverse participation ratios . Eigenvectors corresponding to Runaways type II
are most localized (i.e., super-exponential), whereas Runaways type I are less
localized than the unperturbed counterparts and have most of their probability
mass in the interior with algebraic decays. The results are corroborated by
applying free probability theory and various other supporting numerical

compared to a proton proton collision, serves as an important indication of the
formation of a thermal medium, the quark gluon plasma. This sort of analysis
strongly depends on understanding the thermal effects of a medium like the
plasma on the states of heavy mesons. In particular, it is crucial to know the
temperature ranges where they undergo a thermal dissociation, or melting.
AdS/QCD models are know to provide an important tool for the calculation of
hadronic masses, but in general are not consistent with the observation that
decay constants of heavy vector mesons decrease with excitation level. It has
recently been shown that this problem can be overcome using a soft wall
background and introducing an extra energy parameter, through the calculation
of correlation functions at a finite position of anti-de Sitter space. This
approach leads to the evaluation of masses and decay constants of S wave
quarkonium states with just one flavor dependent and one flavor independent
parameters. Here we extend this more realistic model to finite temperatures and
analyse the thermal behavior of the states $1S, 2S$ and $ 3S$ of bottomonium
and charmonium. The corresponding spectral function exhibits a consistent
picture for the melting of the states where, for each flavor, the higher
excitations melt at lower temperatures. We estimate for these six states, the
energy ranges in which the heavy vector mesons undergo a transition from a well
defined peak in the spectral function to complete melting in the thermal
medium. A very clear distinction between the heavy flavors emerges, with
bottomonium state $\Upsilon (1S)$ surviving deconfinemet transition at
temperatures much larger than the critical deconfinement temperature of the
medium.

report collective ultrastrong light-matter coupling in an ultrahigh-mobility
two-dimensional electron gas in a high-$Q$ terahertz photonic-crystal cavity in
a quantizing magnetic field, demonstrating a cooperativity of $\sim$360. The
splitting of cyclotron resonance (CR) into the lower and upper polariton
branches exhibited a $\sqrt{n_\mathrm{e}}$-dependence on the electron density
($n_\mathrm{e}$), a hallmark of collective vacuum Rabi splitting. Furthermore,
a small but definite blue shift was observed for the polariton frequencies due
to the normally negligible $A^2$ term in the light-matter interaction
Hamiltonian. Finally, the high-$Q$ cavity suppressed the superradiant decay of
coherent CR, which resulted in an unprecedentedly narrow intrinsic CR linewidth
of 5.6 GHz at 2 K. These results open up a variety of new possibilities to
combine the traditional disciplines of many-body condensed matter physics and

are accelerated up to $>$PeV in GC. The interaction between cosmic rays and
molecular clouds is responsible for the multi-TeV $\gamma$-ray emissions from
both the point source and diffuse sources today. Enhanced by the small volume
filling factor (VFF) of the clumpy structure, the absorption of the
$\gamma$-rays leads to a sharp cutoff spectrum at tens of TeV produced in the

becomes negligible. As a result, the spectra of $\gamma$-ray emissions for both

expected from the point source, which can be observed by future projects CTA

efficiency is one for emitters in free space and there is no room for
enhancement). Such emission enhancement is stationary and should be observable
even with strong dissipation and dephasing under incoherent pump. Solid-state

spatio-temporally resolved reaction-diffusion systems. However, in many cases,
these methods can quickly become extremely computationally intensive with
increasing particle numbers. An alternative description of many of these
systems can be derived in the diffusive limit as a deterministic, continuum
system of partial differential equations. Although the numerical solution of
such partial differential equations is, in general, much more efficient than
the full stochastic simulation, the deterministic continuum description is
generally not valid when copy numbers are low and stochastic effects dominate.
Therefore, to take advantage of the benefits of both of these types of models,
each of which may be appropriate in different parts of a spatial domain, we
have developed an algorithm that can be used to couple these two types of model
together. This hybrid coupling algorithm uses an overlap region between the two
modelling regimes. By coupling fluxes at one end of the interface and using a
concentration-matching condition at the other end, we ensure that mass is
appropriately transferred between PDE- and compartment-based regimes. Our
methodology gives notable reductions in simulation time in comparison with
using a fully stochastic model, whilst maintaining the important stochastic
features of the system and providing detail in appropriate areas of the domain.
We test our hybrid methodology robustly by applying it to several biologically
motivated problems including diffusion and morphogen gradient formation. Our
analysis shows that the resulting error is small, unbiased and does not grow
over time.

new strategies for the optimal design of sequential experiments. First, we
rigorously formulate the general sequential optimal experimental design (sOED)
problem as a dynamic program. Batch and greedy designs are shown to result from
special cases of this formulation. We then focus on sOED for parameter
inference, adopting a Bayesian formulation with an information theoretic design
objective. To make the problem tractable, we develop new numerical approaches
for nonlinear design with continuous parameter, design, and observation spaces.
We approximate the optimal policy by using backward induction with regression
to construct and refine value function approximations in the dynamic program.
The proposed algorithm iteratively generates trajectories via exploration and
exploitation to improve approximation accuracy in frequently visited regions of
the state space. Numerical results are verified against analytical solutions in
a linear-Gaussian setting. Advantages over batch and greedy design are then
demonstrated on a nonlinear source inversion problem where we seek an optimal

probability of traversing an edge depends on the degrees of its endpoints. We
confirm a conjecture of Abdullah, Cooper and Draief [2015] that the min-degree

prove the following lemma about spanning trees.
  Let $R(e)$ denote for edge $e$ the minimum degree among its two endpoints. We
say that a weight function $W$ for the edges is feasible if it is nonnegative,
dominated by $R$ (for every edge $W(e) \le R(e)$) and the sum over all edges of
the ratios $W(e)/R(e)$ equals $n-1$. For example, in trees $W(e) = R(e)$, and
in regular graphs the sum of edge weights is $d(n-1)$.
  {\bf Lemma:} for every feasible $W$, the minimum weight spanning tree has

for increasing mission productivity by assigning prioritized tasks while
guiding the vehicle toward its final destination in a terrain covered by
several waypoints; and the lower level is responsible for vehicle's safe

different uncertain static/moving obstacles similar to actual ocean

Then, based on the magnifications, we calculate the signed cusp and fold

relation map has positive and negative regions, and the positive region is
usually larger than the negative region as has been confirmed before. It can
also explain that for many observed fold image pairs, the fluxes of the Fermat

a new quantity cross relation which describes the magnification discrepancy
between two minimum images and two saddle images. Distance ratio is also
defined as the ratio of the distance of two saddle images to that of two
minimum images. We calculate the cross relations and distance ratios for nine
observed Einstein crosses. In theory, for most of the quad lens models, the
cross relations decrease as the distance ratios increase. In observation, the
cross relations of the nine samples do not agree with the quad lens models very
well, nevertheless, the cross relations of the nine samples do not give obvious
evidence for anomalous flux ratio as the cusp and fold types do. Then, we
discuss several reasons for the disagreement, and expect good consistencies for

non-terminals, the goal is to compress the graph (i.e., reduce the number of
non-terminals) using minor operations while preserving terminal distances
approximately.The distortion of a compressed graph is the maximum
multiplicative blow-up of distances between all pairs of terminals. We study
the trade-off between the number of non-terminals and the distortion. This
problem generalizes the Steiner Point Removal (SPR) problem, in which all
non-terminals must be removed.
  We introduce a novel black-box reduction to convert any lower bound on
distortion for the SPR problem into a super-linear lower bound on the number of
non-terminals, with the same distortion, for our problem. This allows us to
show that there exist graphs such that every minor with distortion less than
$2~/~2.5~/~3$ must have $\Omega(k^2)~/~\Omega(k^{5/4})~/~\Omega(k^{6/5})$
non-terminals, plus more trade-offs in between. The black-box reduction has an
interesting consequence: if the tight lower bound on distortion for the SPR
problem is super-constant, then allowing any $O(k)$ non-terminals will not help
improving the lower bound to a constant.
  We also build on the existing results on spanners, distance oracles and
connected 0-extensions to show a number of upper bounds for general graphs,
planar graphs, graphs that exclude a fixed minor and bounded treewidth graphs.
Among others, we show that any graph admits a minor with $O(\log k)$ distortion

$1+\varepsilon$ distortion and $\widetilde{O}((k/\varepsilon)^{2})$

emerges from doped Mott insulators. The physics of the parent state seems
deceivingly simple: The hopping of the electrons from site to site is
prohibited because their on-site Coulomb repulsion U is larger than the kinetic
energy gain t. When doping these materials by inserting a small percentage of
extra carriers, the electrons become mobile but the strong correlations from
the Mott state are thought to survive; inhomogeneous electronic order, a
mysterious pseudogap and, eventually, superconductivity appear. How the
insertion of dopant atoms drives this evolution is not known, nor whether these
phenomena are mere distractions specific to hole-doped cuprates or represent
the genuine physics of doped Mott insulators. Here, we visualize the evolution
of the electronic states of (Sr1-xLax)2IrO4, which is an effective spin-1/2
Mott insulator like the cuprates, but is chemically radically different. Using
spectroscopic-imaging STM, we find that for doping concentration of x=5%, an
inhomogeneous, phase separated state emerges, with the nucleation of pseudogap
puddles around clusters of dopant atoms. Within these puddles, we observe the
same glassy electronic order that is so iconic for the underdoped cuprates.
Further, we illuminate the genesis of this state using the unique possibility
to localize dopant atoms on topographs in these samples. At low doping, we find
evidence for much deeper trapping of carriers compared to the cuprates. This
leads to fully gapped spectra with the chemical potential at mid-gap, which
abruptly collapse at a threshold of around 4%. Our results clarify the melting

incomplete and isolated skyrmion states can emerge as the ground state in
absence of both external magnetic field and magnetocrystalline anisotropy. In
this work, we study the dynamic properties (resonance frequencies and
corresponding eigenmodes) of skyrmionic states in thin film FeGe disk samples.
We employ two different methods in finite-element based micromagnetic
simulation: eigenvalue and ringdown method. The eigenvalue method allows us to
identify all resonance frequencies and corresponding eigenmodes that can exist
in the simulated system. However, using a particular experimentally feasible
excitation can excite only a limited set of eigenmodes. Because of that, we
perform ringdown simulations that resemble the experimental setup using both
in-plane and out-of-plane excitations. In addition, we report the nonlinear
dependence of resonance frequencies on the external magnetic bias field and
disk sample diameter and discuss the possible reversal mode of skyrmionic
states. We compare the power spectral densities of incomplete skyrmion and
isolated skyrmion states and observe several key differences that can
contribute to the experimental identification of the state present in the
sample. We measure the FeGe Gilbert damping, and using its value we determine
what eigenmodes can be expected to be observed in experiments. Finally, we show
that neglecting the demagnetisation energy contribution or ignoring the
magnetisation variation in the out-of-film direction - although not changing
the eigenmode's magnetisation dynamics significantly - changes their resonance
frequencies substantially. Apart from contributing to the understanding of
skyrmionic states physics, this systematic work can be used as a guide for the
experimental identification of skyrmionic states in confined helimagnetic
nanostructures.

structures found as a function of temperature for \hfo\ are described by the
magnetic groups Pb$'$n$'2_1$, Pbn$2_1$ and Pbn$'2_1'$ and are stable in the
temperature ranges $\approx$ 600-55~K, 55-37~K and 35$>T>2$~K respectively. In
all three the fundamental coupling between the Fe sub-lattices remains the same
and only their orientation and the degree of canting away from the ideal axial
direction varies. The magnetic polarisation of the Ho sub-lattices in these two
higher temperature regions, in which the major components of the Fe moment lie
along $x$ and $y$, is very small. The canting of the moments from the axial
directions is attributed to the antisymmetric interactions allowed by the
crystal symmetry. They include contributions from single ion anisotropy as well
as the Dzyaloshinski antisymmetric exchange. In the low temperature phase two
further structural transitions are apparent in which the spontaneous
magnetisation changes sign with respect to the underlying antiferromagnetic
configuration. In this temperature range the antisymmetric exchange energy
varies rapidly as the the Ho sub-lattices begin to order. So long as the
ordered Ho moments are small the antisymmetric exchange is due only to Fe-Fe
interactions, but as the degree of Ho order increases the Fe-Ho interactions
take over whilst at the lowest temperatures, when the Ho moments approach
saturation the Ho-Ho interactions dominate. The reversals of the spontaneous
magnetisation found in this study suggest that in \hfo\ the sums of the Fe-Fe
and Ho-Ho antisymmetric interactions have the same sign as one another, but
that of the Ho-Fe terms is opposite.

bacterial two-component signaling systems. We obtain a striking 0.93 true

the capture of solid bodies by the disks would likely influence the growth of
the planets and formation of satellite systems around them. In addition to dust
particles that are supplied to the disk with inflowing gas, recent studies
suggest the importance of capture of planetesimals whose motion is decoupled
from the gas, but orbital evolution of captured bodies in circumplanetary gas
disks has not been studied in detail. In the present work, using three-body
orbital integration and analytic calculations, we examine orbital
characteristics and subsequent dynamical evolution of planetesimals captured by
gas drag from circumplanetary gas disks. We find that the semi-major axes of
the planet-centered orbits of planetesimals at the time of permanent capture
are smaller than about one third of the planet's Hill radius in most cases.
Typically, captured bodies rapidly spiral into the planet, and the rate of the
orbital decay is faster for the retrograde orbits due to the strong headwind
from the circumplanetary gas. When a planetesimal captured into a retrograde
orbit suffers from sufficiently strong gas drag before spiraling into the
planet, its orbit turns to the prograde direction at a radial location that can
be explained using the Stokes number. We also find that those captured into
certain types of orbits can survive for a long period of time even under gas
drag both in the prograde and retrograde cases, which may be important for the
origin of irregular satellites of giant planets.

would form. While solid bodies captured by the circumplanetary disks likely
contribute to the growth of the planets and regular satellites around them,
some of captured bodies would remain in planet-centered orbits after the
dispersal of the disk. We examine capture and subsequent orbital evolution of
planetesimals in waning circumplanetary gas disks using three-body orbital
integration. We find that some of captured planetesimals can survive in the
circumplanetary disk for a long period of time under such weak gas drag.
Captured planetesimals have semi-major axes smaller than about one third of the
planet's Hill radius. Distributions of their eccentricities and inclinations
after disk dispersal depend on the strength of gas drag and the timescale of
disk dispersal, and initially strong gas drag and quick disk dispersal
facilitates capture and survival of planetesimals. However, in such a case,
final orbital eccentricities and inclinations of captured bodies remain rather
large. Although our results suggest that some of the present irregular
satellites of gas giant planets with small semi-major axes would have been
captured by gas drag, other mechanisms are required to fully explain their
current orbital characteristics.

to evaluate their accuracy and the reliability of the error bars.
  Methods: In the context of the SpaceInn network, we carried out a
hare-and-hounds exercise in which one group produced ""observed"" oscillation
spectra for 10 artificial solar-type stars, and various groups characterised
these stars using either forward modelling or acoustic glitch signatures.
  Results: Results based on the forward modelling approach were accurate to 1.5
% (radius), 3.9 % (mass), 23 % (age), 1.5 % (surface gravity), and 1.8 % (mean
density). For the two 1 Msun stellar targets, the accuracy on the age is better
than 10 % thereby satisfying PLATO 2.0 requirements. The average accuracies for
the acoustic radii of the base of the convection zone, the He II ionisation,
and the Gamma_1 peak were 17 %, 2.4 %, and 1.9 %, respectively. Glitch fitting
analysis seemed to be affected by aliasing problems for some of the targets.
  Conclusions: Forward modelling is the most accurate approach, but needs to be
complemented by model-independent results from, e.g., glitch analysis.
Furthermore, global optimisation algorithms provide more robust error bars.

However, an inevitable problem when dealing with data integration from multiple
sources is that multiple different sources often provide conflicting objects
for a certain predicate of the same real-world entity, so-called object
conflicts problem. Currently, the object conflicts problem has not received
sufficient attention in the Linked Data community. In this paper, we first
formalize the object conflicts resolution problem as computing the joint
distribution of variables on a heterogeneous information network called the
Source-Object Network, which successfully captures the all correlations from
objects and Linked Data sources. Then, we introduce a novel approach based on
network effects called ObResolution(Object Resolution), to identify a true
object from multiple conflicting objects. ObResolution adopts a pairwise Markov
Random Field (pMRF) to model all evidences under a unified framework. Extensive
experimental results on six real-world datasets show that our method exhibits
higher accuracy than existing approaches and it is robust and consistent in

the relations expressing the A=6 or 7 sum in terms of the A=4 sum prove to be
valid with rather high accuracy. In the region of momentum transfers around 1
fm^{-1} the longitudinal correlation functions of 6Li and 7Li nuclei are found
to be close to that of the alpha-particle. The experimental longitudinal sums
in the range between 0.450 and 1.625 fm^{-1} are employed to perform comparison
with those calculated in the framework of cluster models. Out of the mentioned
experimental sums, those in the range between 0.750 and 1.000 fm^{-1} in the

fluid near Minnaert resonant frequency. We start with a multiple scattering
formulation of the scattering problem of an incident wave by a large number of
identical small bubbles in a homogeneous fluid. Under certain conditions on the
configuration of the bubbles, we justify the point interaction approximation
and establish an effective medium theory for the bubbly fluid as the number of
bubbles tends to infinity. The convergence rate is also derived. As a
consequence, we show that near and below the Minnaert resonant frequency, the
obtained effective media can have a high refractive index, which is the reason
for the super-focusing experiment observed in ""Subwavelength focusing in bubbly
media using broadband time reversal"", Physical Review, B (2015), by M. Lanoy et
al. Moreover, our results indicate that the obtained effective medium can be
dissipative above the Minnaert resonant frequency, while at that frequency,
effective medium theory does not hold. Our theory sheds light on the mechanism
of the extraordinary wave properties of metamaterials, which include bubbly

that stronger W2400 tends to be associated with smaller virial estimates from

smaller black holes that are still growing. The differential effect for LQG

of measurements (random variables) with known joint distributions of some of
its subsets. However, if these subsets of measurements are not disjoint,
contextuality is mathematically impossible even if one generally allows (as one
must) for random variables not to be jointly distributed. To avoid
contradictions one has to adopt the Contextuality-by-Default approach:
measurements made in different contexts are always distinct and stochastically
unrelated to each other. Contextuality is reformulated then in terms of the
(im)possibility of imposing on all the measurements in a system a joint
distribution of a particular kind: such that any measurements of one and the
same property made in different contexts satisfy a specified property,
$\mathcal{C}$. In the traditional analysis of contextuality $\mathcal{C}$ means
""are equal to each other with probability 1"". However, if the system of
measurements violates the ""no-disturbance principle"", due to signaling or
experimental biases, then the meaning of $\mathcal{C}$ has to be generalized,
and the proposed generalization is ""are equal to each other with maximal
possible probability"" (applied to any set of measurements of one and the same
property). This approach is illustrated on arbitrary systems of binary
measurements, including most of quantum systems of traditional interest in
contextuality studies (irrespective of whether ""no-disturbance"" principle holds

extent of the hot ridge, suggesting that the filament is spatially separated

obtained from the weak pion-production amplitudes for the nucleon derived in
the non-linear $\sigma$-model together with weak excitation of the
$\Delta(1232)$ resonance and its subsequent decay into $N\pi$. With these
currents we compute the five 2p-2h response functions contributing to
$(\nu_l,l^-)$ and $(\overline{\nu}_l,l^+)$ reactions in the relativistic Fermi
gas model. The total current is the sum of vector and axial two-body currents.
The vector current is related to the electromagnetic MEC operator that
contributes to electron scattering. This allows one to check our model by
comparison with the results of De Pace {\em et al.,} Nuclear Physics A 726
(2003) 303. Thus our model is a natural extension of that model to the weak
sector with the addition of the axial MEC operator. The dependences of the
response functions on several ingredients of the approach are analyzed.
Specifically we discuss relativistic effects, quantify the size of the
direct-exchange interferences, and the relative importance of the axial versus
vector current.

states. The powder inelastic neutron scattering data on these geometrically
frustrated $j_{\rm eff}=1/2$ Mott insulators provide clear evidence for gapped
spin wave excitations with very weak dispersion. The INS results and
thermodynamic data on these materials can be reproduced by conventional
Heisenberg-Ising models with significant uniaxial Ising anisotropy and sizeable
second-neighbor ferromagnetic interactions. Such a uniaxial Ising exchange
interaction is symmetry-forbidden on the ideal fcc lattice, so that it can only
arise from the weak crystal distortions away from the ideal fcc limit. This may
suggest that even weak distortions in $j_{\rm eff}=1/2$ Mott insulators might
lead to strong exchange anisotropies. More tantalizingly, however, we find an
alternative viable explanation of the INS results in terms of spin models with
a dominant Kitaev interaction. In contrast to the uniaxial Ising exchange, the
highly-directional Kitaev interaction is a type of exchange anisotropy which is
symmetry-allowed even on the ideal fcc lattice. The Kitaev model has a magnon
gap induced by quantum order-by-disorder, while weak anisotropies of the Kitaev
couplings generated by the symmetry-lowering due to lattice distortions, can
pin the order and enhance the magnon gap. Our findings highlight how even
conventional magnetic orders in heavy transition metal oxides may be driven by
highly-directional exchange interactions rooted in strong spin-orbit coupling.

and magnesium stearate were manufactured continuously and in batches. The
effect of two processing parameters, compaction force and level of shear strain
were examined. Young's modulus and tensile strength of tablets were obtained by
ultrasound and diametrical mechanical testing, respectively. It was found that
as the blend was exposed to increasing levels of shear strain, the speed of
sound in the tablets decreased and the tablets became both softer and
mechanically weaker. Moreover, the results indicate that two separate tablet
material properties (e.g., relative density and Young's modulus) are necessary
in order to predict tensile strength. A strategy for hardness prediction is
proposed that uses the existing models for Young's modulus and tensile strength
of porous materials. Ultrasound testing was found to be very sensitive in
differentiating tablets with similar formulation but produced under different
processing conditions (e.g., different level of shear strain), thus, providing
a fast, and non-destructive method for hardness prediction that could be
incorporated to a continuous manufacturing process.

issue of dynamical mass generation in Yang-Mills theories, and, in particular,
with the infrared finiteness of the gluon propagators, observed in a multitude
of recent lattice simulations. Our analysis is manifestly gauge-invariant, in
the sense that it preserves the transversality of the gluon self-energy, and
gauge-independent, given that the conclusions do not depend on the choice of
the gauge-fixing parameter within the linear covariant gauges. The central
construction relies crucially on the subtle interplay between the Abelian Ward
identities satisfied by the nonperturbative vertices and a special integral
identity that enforces a vast number of 'seagull cancellations' among the one-
and two-loop dressed diagrams of the gluon Schwinger-Dyson equation. The key
result of these considerations is that the gluon propagator remains rigorously
massless, provided that the vertices do not contain (dynamical) massless poles.
When such poles are incorporated into the vertices, under the pivotal
requirement of respecting the gauge symmetry of the theory, the terms
comprising the Ward identities conspire in such a way as to still enforce the
total annihilation of all quadratic divergences, inducing, at the same time,
residual contributions that account for the saturation of gluon propagators in
the deep infrared.

connecting electron and hole pockets. We here predict that these systems have
remarkable properties in presence of magnetic fields. Most saliently, we show
that the nature of the chiral anomaly depends crucially on the relative angle

first introduce the current state-of-the-art of network estimation. Second, we
provide a rationale why researchers should investigate the accuracy of

the stability of centrality indices, and (C) test whether network connections

introduce two novel statistical methods: for (B) the correlation stability
coefficient, and for (C) the bootstrapped difference test for edge-weights and
centrality indices. We conducted and present simulation studies to assess the
performance of both methods. Finally, we developed the free R-package bootnet
that allows for estimating psychological networks in a generalized framework in
addition to the proposed bootstrap methods. We showcase bootnet in a tutorial,

These results are obtained by applying a pixel-by-pixel Hapke radiative
transfer model to the LEISA scans. Our analysis focuses mainly on the large
scale latitudinal variations of methane and nitrogen ices and aims at setting
observational constraints to volatile transport models. Specifically, we find
three latitudinal bands: the first, enriched in methane, extends from the pole
to 55deg N, the second dominated by nitrogen, continues south to 35deg N, and
the third, composed again mainly of methane, reaches 20deg N. We demonstrate
that the distribution of volatiles across these surface units can be explained
by differences in insolation over the past few decades. The latitudinal pattern
is broken by Sputnik Planitia, a large reservoir of volatiles, with nitrogen
playing the most important role. The physical properties of methane and
nitrogen in this region are suggestive of the presence of a cold trap or
possible volatile stratification. Furthermore our modeling results point to a
possible sublimation transport of nitrogen from the northwest edge of Sputnik

general framework of $\Phi$-convexity. Under general conditions on the class of
functions $\Phi$, the Krein-Milman-Ky Fan theorem asserts then, that every
compact $\Phi$-convex subset of a Hausdorff space, is the $\Phi$-convex hull of
its $\Phi$-extremal points. We prove in this paper that, in the metrizable case
the situation is rather better. Indeed, we can replace the set of
$\Phi$-extremal points by the smaller subset of $\Phi$-exposed points. We
establish under general conditions on the class of functions $\Phi$, that every
$\Phi$-convex compact metrizable subset of a Hausdorff space, is the
$\Phi$-convex hull of its $\Phi$-exposed points. As a consequence we obtain
that each convex weak compact metrizable (resp. convex weak$^*$ compact
metrizable) subset of a Banach space (resp. of a dual Banach space), is the
closed convex hull of its exposed points (resp. the weak$^*$ closed convex hull

excellent performance in Run 1 of LHC data taking, and are expected to continue
to do so during LHC operation at design luminosity, both experiments will have
to exchange their tracking systems when the LHC is upgraded to the
high-luminosity LHC (HL-LHC) around the year 2024. The new tracking systems
need to operate in an environment in which both the hit densities and the
radiation damage will be about an order of magnitude higher than today. In
addition, the new trackers need to contribute to the first level trigger in
order to maintain a high data-taking efficiency for the interesting processes.
Novel detector technologies have to be developed to meet these very challenging
goals. The German groups active in the upgrades of the ATLAS and CMS tracking
systems have formed a collaborative ""Project on Enabling Technologies for
Silicon Microstrip Tracking Detectors at the HL-LHC"" (PETTL), which was
supported by the Helmholtz Alliance ""Physics at the Terascale"" during the years
2013 and 2014. The aim of the project was to share experience and to work
together on key areas of mutual interest during the R&D phase of these

experience, radiation hardness of silicon sensors, low mass system design,
automated precision assembly procedures, and irradiations. This report

Hayward solutions. Our results show that the behavior of Hawking's radiation
changes considerably at the small radii regime such that the black hole does
not evaporate completely and a stable remnant is left. We show that stability
conditions hold for the Hayward solutions found in the Einstein gravity coupled
with nonlinear electrodynamics. We analyse the effect that an inspired model of
the noncommutativity of spacetime can have on the thermodynamics of Hayward
spacetimes. This has been done by applying the noncommutative effects to the
non-rotating and rotating Hayward black holes. In this setup, all point
structures get replaced by smeared distributions owing to this inspired
approach. The noncommutative effects result in a colder black hole in the small
radii regime as Hayward's free parameter $g$ increases. As well as the effects
of noncommutativity and the rotation factor, the configuration of the remnant
can be substantially affected by the parameter $g$. However, in the rotating
solution it is not so sensitive to $g$ with respect to the non-rotating case.
As a consequence, Hayward's parameter, the noncommutativity and the rotation
may raise the minimum value of energy for the possible formation of black holes
in TeV-scale collisions. This observation can be used as a potential
explanation for the absence of black holes in the current energy scales
produced at particle colliders. However, it is also found that if extra
dimensions do exist, then the possibility of the black hole production at
energy scales accessible at the LHC for large numbers of extra dimensions will
be larger.

equivalents is an emerging technique in the dynamic analysis of power systems
including power electronic converters. The technique has been applied for
decades in DC-power systems, and it was recently adopted to map the impedances
in AC systems. Most of the work on AC systems can be categorized in two
approaches. One is the analysis of the system in the \textit{dq}-domain,
whereas the other applies harmonic linearization in the phase domain through
symmetric components. Impedance models based on analytical calculations,
numerical simulation and experimental studies have been previously developed
and verified in both domains independently. The authors of previous studies
discuss the advantages and disadvantages of each domain separately, but neither
a rigorous comparison nor an attempt to bridge them has been conducted. The
present paper attempts to close this gap by deriving the mathematical
formulation that shows the equivalence between the \textit{dq}-domain and the
sequence domain impedances. A modified form of the sequence domain impedance
matrix is proposed, and with this definition the stability estimates obtained
with the Generalized Nyquist Criterion (GNC) become equivalent in both domains.
The second contribution of the paper is the definition of a \textit{Mirror
Frequency Decoupled} (MFD) system. The analysis of MFD systems is less complex
than that of non-MFD systems because the positive and negative sequences are
decoupled. This paper shows that if a system is incorrectly assumed to be MFD,
this will lead to an erroneous or ambiguous estimation of the equivalent
impedance.
