future power grid. However, the intermittency and stochasticity of these
renewable resources bring significant challenges to the reliable and economic
operation of power systems. Motivated by these challenges, we present a
multistage adaptive robust optimization model for the unit commitment (UC)
problem, which models the sequential nature of the dispatch process and
utilizes a new type of dynamic uncertainty sets to capture the temporal and
spatial correlations of wind and solar power. The model also considers the
operation of energy storage devices. We propose a simplified and effective
affine policy for dispatch decisions, and develop an efficient algorithmic
framework using a combination of constraint generation and duality based
reformulation with various improvements. Extensive computational experiments
show that the proposed method can efficiently solve multistage robust UC
problems on the Polish 2736-bus system under high dimensional uncertainty of 60
wind farms and 30 solar farms. The computational results also suggest that the
proposed model leads to significant benefits in both costs and reliability over
robust models with traditional uncertainty sets as well as deterministic models
with reserve rules.

disciplines, especially for large datasets. However the method is known to be
highly sensitive to initial seed selection of cluster centers. K-means++ has
been proposed to overcome this problem and has been shown to have better
accuracy and computational efficiency than k-means. In many clustering problems
though -such as when classifying georeferenced data for mapping applications-
standardization of clustering methodology, specifically, the ability to arrive
at the same cluster assignment for every run of the method i.e. replicability
of the methodology, may be of greater significance than any perceived measure
of accuracy, especially when the solution is known to be non-unique, as in the
case of k-means clustering. Here we propose a simple initial seed selection
algorithm for k-means clustering along one attribute that draws initial cluster
boundaries along the 'deepest valleys' or greatest gaps in dataset. Thus, it
incorporates a measure to maximize distance between consecutive cluster centers
which augments the conventional k-means optimization for minimum distance
between cluster center and cluster members. Unlike existing initialization
methods, no additional parameters or degrees of freedom are introduced to the
clustering algorithm. This improves the replicability of cluster assignments by
as much as 100% over k-means and k-means++, virtually reducing the variance
over different runs to zero, without introducing any additional parameters to
the clustering process. Further, the proposed method is more computationally
efficient than k-means++ and in some cases, more accurate.

metal dichalcogenides (TMD) such as gated MoS$_2$ and monolayer NbSe$_2$ have
in-plane upper critical magnetic fields much higher than the Pauli limit. This
is due to the so-called Ising spin-orbit coupling (SOC) of TMD which pins the
electron spins along the out-of-plane directions and protects the Cooper pairs
from in-plane magnetic fields. However, many TMD materials with extremely large
Ising SOC, in the order of a few hundred meV, are not superconducting. In this
work, we show that TMD materials can induce strong Ising SOC on ordinary
$s$-wave superconductors through proximity effect. By solving the
self-consistent gap equation of the TMD/superconductor heterostructure, we
found that the $H_{c2}$ of the $s$-wave superconductor can be strongly
enhanced. Importantly, when the in-plane field is larger than the Pauli limit
field and weaker than $H_{c2}$, the heterostructure becomes a nodal topological
superconductor which supports Majorana flat bands.

neutron stars. Motivated by this, I explore the interaction of FRBs with young
supernova remnants (SNRs), and I discuss the potential observational
consequences and constraints of such a scenario. As the SN ejecta plows into
the interstellar medium (ISM), a reverse shock is generated that passes back
through the material and ionizes it. This leads to a dispersion measure (DM)
associated with the SNR as well as a time derivative for DM. Times when DM is
high are generally overshadowed by free-free absorption, which, depending on
the mass of the ejecta and the density of the ISM, may be probed at frequencies
of $400\,{\rm MHz}$ to $1.4\,{\rm GHz}$ on timescales of $\sim100-500\,{\rm
yrs}$ after the SN. Magnetic fields generated at the reverse shock may be high
enough to explain Faraday rotation that has been measured for one FRB. If FRBs
are powered by the spin energy of a young NS (rather than magnetic energy), the
NS must have a magnetic field $\lesssim10^{11}-10^{12}\,{\rm G}$ to ensure that
it does not spin down too quickly while the SNR is still optically thick at
radio frequencies. In the future, once there are distance measurements to FRBs
and their energetics are better understood, the spin of the NS can also be
constrained.

cosmological constant imply that R symmetry must be spontaneously broken at low
energies. Based on this observation, we suppose that, in the sector responsible
for low-energy R symmetry breaking, a discrete R symmetry remains preserved at
high energies and only becomes dynamically broken at relatively late times in
the cosmological evolution, i.e., after the dynamical breaking of SUSY. Prior
to R symmetry breaking, the Universe is then bound to be in a quasi-de Sitter
phase---which offers a dynamical explanation for the occurrence of cosmic
inflation. This scenario yields a new perspective on the interplay between SUSY
breaking and inflation, which neatly fits into the paradigm of high-scale SUSY:
inflation is driven by the SUSY-breaking vacuum energy density, while the
chiral field responsible for SUSY breaking, the Polonyi field, serves as the
inflaton. Because R symmetry is broken only after inflation, slow-roll
inflation is not spoiled by otherwise dangerous gravitational corrections in
supergravity. We illustrate our idea by means of a concrete example, in which
both SUSY and R symmetry are broken by strong gauge dynamics and in which
late-time R symmetry breaking is triggered by a small inflaton field value. In
this model, the scales of inflation and SUSY breaking are unified; the
inflationary predictions are similar to those of F-term hybrid inflation in
supergravity; reheating proceeds via gravitino decay at temperatures consistent
with thermal leptogenesis; and the sparticle mass spectrum follows from pure
gravity mediation. Dark matter consists of thermally produced winos with a mass
in the TeV range.

nilotinib) have been developed to treat Chronic Myeloid Leukemia (CML). Despite
an initial response to therapy, drug resistance remains a problem for some CML
patients. Recent studies have shown that resistance mutations that preexist
treatment can be detected in a substan- tial number of patients, and that this
may be associated with eventual treatment failure. One proposed method to
extend treatment efficacy is to use a combination of multiple targeted
therapies. However, the design of such combination therapies (timing, sequence,
etc.) remains an open challenge. In this work we mathematically model the
dynamics of CML response to combination therapy and analyze the impact of
combination treatment schedules on treatment efficacy in patients with
preexisting resistance. We then propose an optimization problem to find the
best schedule of multiple therapies based on the evolution of CML according to
our ordinary differential equation model. This resulting optimiza- tion problem
is nontrivial due to the presence of ordinary different equation constraints
and integer variables. Our model also incorporates realistic drug toxicity
constraints by tracking the dynamics of patient neutrophil counts in response
to therapy. Using realis- tic parameter estimates, we determine optimal
combination strategies that maximize time until treatment failure.

the contacts between the particles. The continuum models are derived from the
discrete model via a micro-macro transition of the discrete relative
displacements and particle rotations to the respective continuum field

compared and, considering the discrete model as reference, the Cosserat model
shows inconsistent predictions of the bulk wave dispersion relations. This can
be explained by an insufficient modeling of sliding mode of particle
interactions in the Cosserat model. An enhanced micropolar model is proposed
including only one new elastic tensor from the more complete second order
gradient micropolar theory. This enhanced micropolar model then involves the
minimum number of elastic constants to consistently predict the dispersion

analytically via Sommerfeld's theory of electric dipole radiation above an
infinite plane. The volume integral equation for the electric field is
discretized using the thermal discrete dipole approximation (T-DDA). The
framework is verified against exact results in the sphere-surface
configuration, and is applied to analyze near-field radiative heat transfer
between a complex-shaped probe and an infinite plane both made of silica. It is
found that when the probe tip size is approximately equal to or smaller than
the gap d separating the probe and the surface, coupled localized surface
phonon (LSPh)-surface phonon-polariton (SPhP) mediated heat transfer occurs. In
this regime, the net spectral heat rate exhibits four resonant modes due to
LSPhs along the minor axis of the probe while the net total heat rate in the
near field follows a d -0.3 power law. Conversely, when the probe tip size is
much larger than the separation gap d, heat transfer is mediated by SPhPs
resulting in two resonant modes in the net spectral heat rate corresponding to
those of a single emitting silica surface while the net total heat rate
approaches a d -2 power law. It is also demonstrated that a complex-shaped
probe can be approximated by a prolate spheroidal electric dipole when the
thermal wavelength is larger than the major axis of the spheroidal dipole and
when the separation gap d is much larger than the radius of curvature of the

processes of adding and subtracting states. We show that unphysical results can
be present in quantum simulations when the old states (that built the density
matrix associated to an open system before the collision) are different from
the additional states generated by the Boltzmann collision operator. As a
consequence of the Fermi Golden rule, the new generated sates are usually
eigenstates of the momentum or kinetic energy. Then, the different
time-evolutions of old and new states involved in a collision process can
originate negative values of the charge density, even longer after the
collision. This unphysical feature disappears when the Boltzmann collision
operator generates states that were already present in the density matrix of
the quantum system before the collision. Following these ideas, in this paper,
we introduce an algorithm that models phonon-electron interactions through the
Boltzmann collision operator without negative values of the charge density. The
model only requires the exact knowledge, at all times, of the states that build

decrease. In this article, we explain why this is the case. Invoking a key
result from mathematical analysis in our model, namely, the inverse function
theorem, we estimate the selection pressures of the mutations as a function of
germline allele frequencies. Under complete dominance of oncogenic mutations,
this selection function is expected to be linearly correlated with the
distribution of the mutant alleles. We demonstrate that this is the case by
investigating the allele frequencies of mutations in oncogenes across various
cancer types, validating our model for mean effective selection. Consistent
with the population genetics model of fitness, the selection function fits a
gamma distribution curve that accurately describes the trend of the mutant
allele frequencies. While existing equations for selection explain evolution at
low allele frequencies, our equations are general formulas for natural
selection under complete dominance operating at all frequencies. We show that
selection exhibits linear behavior at all times, favoring dominant alleles with
respect to the change in recessive allele frequency. Also, these equations
show, selection behaves like power-law against the recessive alleles at low
dominant allele frequency.

the evolution of the modes of the classical electromagnetic field inside an
ideal cavity, containing a thin slab with the time-dependent conductivity
$\sigma(t)$ and dielectric permittivity $\varepsilon(t)$, is derived for the
dispersion-less media. This problem is analyzed in connection with the attempts
to simulate the so called Dynamical Casimir Effect in three-dimensional
electromagnetic cavities, containing a thin semiconductor slab, periodically
illuminated by strong laser pulses. Therefore it is assumed that functions
$\sigma(t)$ and $\delta\varepsilon(t)=\varepsilon(t)-\varepsilon(0)$ are
different from zero during short time intervals (pulses) only. The main goal is
to find the conditions, under which the initial nonzero classical field could
be amplified after a single pulse (or a series of pulses). Approximate
solutions to the dynamical equations are obtained in the cases of ""small"" and
""big"" maximal values of the functions $\sigma(t)$ and $\delta\varepsilon(t)$.
  It is shown, that the single-mode approximation, used in the previous
studies, can be justified in the case of ""small"" perturbations. But the
initially excited field mode cannot be amplified in this case, if the laser
pulses generate free carriers inside the slab. The amplification could be
possible, in principle, for extremely high maximal values of conductivity and
the concentration of free carries (the model of ""almost ideal conductor""),
created inside the slab, under the crucial condition, that the function
$\delta\varepsilon(t)$ is {\em negative}. This result follows from a simple
approximate analytical solution, and it is confirmed by exact numerical
calculations. However, the evaluations show, that the necessary energy of laser
pulses must be, probably, unrealistically high.

major pathways to merger. We use numerical simulations to explore the evolution
of BHBs inside the radius of influence of supermassive black holes (SMBHs) in
galactic centers. In this region the evolution of binaries is dominated by
perturbations from the central SMBH. In particular, as first pointed out by
Antonini and Perets, the Kozai-Lidov (KL) mechanism trades relative inclination
of the BHB to the SMBH for eccentricity of the BHB, and for some orientations
can bring the BHB to an eccentricity near unity. At very high eccentricities,
GW emission from the BHB can become efficient, causing the members of the BHB
to coalesce. We use a novel combination of two N-body codes to follow this
evolution. We are forced to simulate small systems to follow the behavior
accurately. We have completed 400 simulations that range from $\sim$ 300 stars
around a $10^{3}$ M$_{\odot}$ black hole to $\sim$ 4500 stars around a $10^{4}$
M$_{\odot}$ black hole. These simulations are the first to follow the internal
orbit of a binary near a SMBH while also following the changes to its external
orbit self-consistently. We find that this mechanism could produce mergers at a
maximum rate per volume of $\sim 100$ Gpc$^{-3}$ yr$^{-1}$ or considerably less
if the inclination oscillations of the binary remain constant as the BHB
inclination to the SMBH changes, or if the binary black hole fraction is small.

sets D_A are called free spectrahedra. These are exactly the free semialgebraic
convex sets.
  This paper studies free analytic maps between free spectrahedra and, under
certain irreducibility assumptions, classifies all those that are bianalytic.
The foundation of such maps turns out to be a very small class of birational
maps we call convexotonic. The convexotonic maps in g variables sit in
correspondence with g-dimensional algebras. If two bounded free spectrahedra
D_A and D_B meeting our irreducibility assumptions are free bianalytic with map
denoted p, then p must (after possibly an affine linear transform) extend to a
convexotonic map corresponding to a g-dimensional algebra spanned by
(U-I)A_1,...,(U-I)A_g for some unitary U. Furthermore, B and UA are unitarily
equivalent.
  The article also establishes a Positivstellensatz for free analytic functions
whose real part is positive semidefinite on a free spectrahedron and proves a
representation for a free analytic map from D_A to D_B (not necessarily
bianalytic). Another result shows that a function analytic on any radial
expansion of a free spectrahedron is approximable by polynomials uniformly on
the spectrahedron. These theorems are needed for classifying free bianalytic
maps.

path-signature layer to extract signature features from the input pen-tip
trajectory, a fully convolutional network to learn informative representation,
a sequence modeling layer to make per-frame predictions on the input sequence
and a transcription layer to translate the predictions into a label sequence.

a sum over all spanning trees of monomials depending on a fixed linear order on

upon this classical theorem of Tutte. It is devoted to an elementary and
detailed proof of this theorem in its natural generality, i.e. not for graphs,
but for matroids.
  In contrast with usual methods, the emphasis is on the properties of maps (as
opposed to elements) naturally associated to a matroid (or a graph) and an
order. In order to fully explain the four-fold symmetry of the proof, we
introduce notion of linking between two matroids on the same set. While every
matroid is, in fact, linked only to itself and to its dual matroid, the notion
of a linking identifies the essential features of the theory and allows to
replace the usual four similar arguments by a single one. This is done in
Theorem 9.1, which is the focal point of the present paper.

of an expanding magnetic cloud embedded in an interplanetary coronal mass

govern bursty user transmissions. To that end, we extend the noisy network

exploring the role of a relay from various perspectives. First, we show that a
relay can provide a DoF gain in bursty channels, unlike in conventional
non-bursty channels. Interestingly, we find that the relaying gain can scale
with additional antennas at the relay to some extent. Moreover, observing that
a relay can help achieve collision-free performances, we establish the
necessary and sufficient condition for attaining collision-free DoF. Lastly, we
consider scenarios in which some physical perturbation shared around the users
may generate data traffic simultaneously, causing transmission patterns across
them to be correlated. We demonstrate that for most cases in such scenarios,
the relaying gain is greater when the users' transmission patterns are more
correlated, hence when more severe collisions take place. Our results have
practical implications in various scenarios of wireless networks such as

consider such an heterogeneous network (HetNet) that ultra-dense small base

macrocell BS provides the control service with low frequency band. However, the
channel estimation for mmWave massive MIMO can be challenging, since the pilot
overhead to acquire the channels associated with a large number of antennas in
mmWave massive MIMO can be prohibitively high. This paper proposes a structured
compressive sensing (SCS)-based channel estimation scheme, where the angular
sparsity of mmWave channels is exploited to reduce the required pilot overhead.
Specifically, since the path loss for non-line-of-sight paths is much larger
than that for line-of-sight paths, the mmWave massive channels in the angular
domain appear the obvious sparsity. By exploiting such sparsity, the required
pilot overhead only depends on the small number of dominated multipath.
Moreover, the sparsity within the system bandwidth is almost unchanged, which
can be exploited for the further improved performance. Simulation results
demonstrate that the proposed scheme outperforms its counterpart, and it can

field-effect transistors (FETs) with split gates, electrically induced lateral
p-n junctions, uniform graphene layer (GL) or perforated (in the p-n junction
depletion region) graphene layer (PGL) channel. The perforated depletion region
forms an array of the nanoconstions or nanoribbons creating the barriers for
the holes and electrons. The operation of the GL-FET- and PGL-FET detectors is
associated with the rectification of the ac current across the lateral p-n
junction enhanced by the excitation of bound plasmonic oscillations in in the
p- and n-sections of the channel. Using the developed device model, we find the
GL-FET and PGL-FET-detectors characteristics. These detectors can exhibit very
high voltage responsivity at the THz radiation frequencies close to the
frequencies of the plasmonic resonances. These frequencies can be effectively
voltage tuned. We show that in PL-FET-detectors the dominant mechanism of the
current rectification is due to the tunneling nonlinearity, whereas in
PGL-FET-detector the current rectification is primarily associated with the
thermionic processes. Due to much lower p-n junction conductance in the
PGL-FET-detectors, their resonant response can be substantially more pronounced
than in the GL-FET-detectors corresponding to fairly high detector
responsivity.

Using cylindrical coordinate system, we have derived the critical linear mass
density of a non-rotating filament required for gravitational collapse to ensue
in the presence of azimuthal magnetic field. Moreover, for such filaments
threaded by axial magnetic field, we show that the growth rates of the modes
having non-zero radial wavenumber are reduced more strongly by the magnetic
field than that of the modes having zero radial wavenumber. More importantly,
our study contributes to the understanding of the stability property of
rotating astrophysical filaments that are more often than not influenced by
magnetic fields. In addition to complementing many relevant numerical studies
reported the literature, our results on filaments under the influence of
magnetic field generalize some of the very recent analytical works
(e.g.,~\citet{jog2014}, etc.). For example, here we prove that even a weak
magnetic field can play a dominant role in determining stability of the
filament when the rotation timescale is larger than the free fall timescale. A
filamentary structure with faster rotation is, however, comparatively more
stable for the same magnetic field. The results reported herein, due to strong
locality assumption, are strictly valid for the modes for which one can ignore
the radial variations in the density and the magnetic field profiles.

(SPPs) and could be realized at subwavelength dimensions in metallic cavities
for applications in nanoscale optics. Plasmonic cavities are also utilized for
terahertz quantum-cascade lasers (QCLs), which are the brightest available
solid-state sources of terahertz radiation. A long standing challenge for
spasers is their poor coupling to the far-field radiation. Unlike conventional
lasers that could produce directional beams, spasers have highly divergent
radiation patterns due to their subwavelength apertures. Here, we theoretically
and experimentally demonstrate a new technique for implementing
distributed-feedback (DFB) that is distinct from any other previously utilized
DFB schemes for semiconductor lasers. The so-termed antenna-feedback scheme
leads to single-mode operation in plasmonic lasers, couples the resonant SPP
mode to a highly directional far-field radiation pattern, and integrates hybrid
SPPs in surrounding medium into the operation of the DFB lasers.
Experimentally, the antenna-feedback method, which does not require the phase
matching to a well-defined effective index, is implemented for terahertz QCLs,
and single-mode terahertz QCLs with beam divergence as small as 4 x 4 degree
are demonstrated, which is the narrowest beam reported for any terahertz QCL
to-date. Moreover, in contrast to negligible radiative-field in conventional
photonic band-edge lasers, in which the periodicity follows the integer
multiple of half-wavelength inside active medium, antenna-feedback breaks this
integer-limit for the first time and enhances the radiative-field of lasing
mode. The antenna-feedback scheme is generally applicable to any plasmonic
laser with a Fabry-Perot cavity irrespective of its operating wavelength, and
could bring plasmonic lasers closer to practical applications.

results for the \textit{routing via matching} model introduced by Alon et
al\cite{5}. This model can be viewed as a communication scheme on a distributed
network. The nodes in the network can communicate via matchings (a step), where
a node exchanges data with its partner. Formally, given a connected graph $G$
with vertices labeled from $[1,...,n]$ and a permutation $\pi$ giving the
destination of pebbles on the vertices the problem is to find a minimum step
routing scheme. This is denoted as the routing time $rt(G,\pi)$ of $G$ given
$\pi$. In this paper we present the following new results, which answer one of
the open problems posed in \cite{5}: 1) Determining whether $rt(G,\pi)$ is $\le
2$ can be done in $O(n^{2.5})$ deterministic time for any arbitrary connected
graph $G$. 2) Determining whether $rt(G,\pi)$ is $\le k$ for any $k \ge 3$ is
NP-Complete. In the second part we study a related property of graphs, which
measures how easy it is to design sorting networks using only the edges of a
given graph. Informally, \textit{sorting number} of a graph is the minimum
depth sorting network that only uses edges of the graph. Many of the classical
results on sorting networks can be represented in this framework. We show that
a tree with maximum degree $\Delta$ can accommodate a $O(\min(n\Delta^2,n^2))$

scenarios for which the DM-pseudoscalar coupling is $CP$ conserving or $CP$
violating. We show that taking a contact interaction is not suitable, even when
the mediator has a mass of the same order of magnitude as the typical momentum
transfer at the direct-detection experiments, such that the allowed DAMA region
is excluded or considerably modified by the correct relic density requirement.
The DAMA result seems to indicate that the $CP$-violating interaction is
dominant at direct searches. We find that, if the proton-to-neutron effective
coupling ratio is $-60\sim -40$, the exclusion limits set by SuperCDMS,
XENON100, and LUX are highly suppressed, and the DAMA signal can thus be easily
reconciled with these null measurements. For this model, the allowed region
determined by the DAMA signal and correct relic density can successfully
satisfy the conditions required by the thermal equilibrium, big bang
nucleosynthesis, and DM self-interactions. The results of future measurements
on flavor physics will provide important constraints on the related models.
Precise measurements performed by COUPP, PICASSO, SIMPLE and KIMS should be

surrounded by several positive ones, and there appeared three FRs. The three
FRs showed apparent slipping motions, and hook structures formed at their ends.
Due to the moving footpoints of the erupting structures, one tight
semi-circular hook disappeared after the slippage along its inner and outer
edge, and coronal dimmings formed within the hook. The east hook also faded as
a result of the magnetic reconnection between the arcades of a remote filament
and a hot loop that was impulsively heated by the under flare loops. Our
results are accordant with the slipping magnetic reconnection regime in 3D
standard model for eruptive flares. We suggest that complex structures of the

photosphere, and the eruption involves at least two magnetic reconnections.

  Foundations for Quantum Information Theory""",,,,"quant-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The notion of a partition on a set is mathematically dual to the notion of a
subset of a set, so there is a logic of partitions dual to Boole's logic of
subsets (Boolean subset logic is usually mis-specified as the special case of
""propositional"" logic). The notion of an element of a subset has as its dual
the notion of a distinction of a partition (a pair of elements in different
blocks). Boole developed finite logical probability as the normalized counting
measure on elements of subsets so there is a dual concept of logical entropy
which is the normalized counting measure on distinctions of partitions. Thus
the logical notion of information is a measure of distinctions. Classical
logical entropy also extends naturally to the notion of quantum logical entropy
which provides a more natural and informative alternative to the usual Von
Neumann entropy in quantum information theory. The quantum logical entropy of a
post-measurement density matrix has the simple interpretation as the
probability that two independent measurements of the same state using the same
observable will have different results. The main result of the paper is that
this increase in quantum logical entropy due to a projective measurement of a
pure state is the sum of the absolute squares of the off-diagonal entries
(`coherences') of the pure state density matrix that are zeroed (decohered) by
the measurement, i.e., the measure of the distinctions (`decoherences') created
by the measurement. The Von Neumann entropy provides no such analysis of
measurement. That result is also classically modelled using ordinary partitions
and density matrices for such partitions in the pedagogical model of QM/Sets
with point probabilities--which for a fixed basis is just sampling a real r.v.

Due to the high photon flux of clinical CT scanners, most of the spectrum

limitations. The recently proposed indirect transmission measurement-based
method requires at least the segmentation of one material, which is
insufficient for CT images of highly noisy and with artifacts. To combat for
the bottleneck of spectrum estimation using segmented CT images, in this study,
we develop a segmentation-free indirect transmission measurement based energy
spectrum estimation method using dual-energy material decomposition. The
general principle of the method is to compare polychromatic forward projection
with raw projection to calibrate a set of unknown weights which are used to
express the unknown spectrum together with a set of model spectra. After
applying dual-energy material decomposition using high- and low-energy raw
projection data, polychromatic forward projection is conducted on
material-specific images. The unknown weights are then iteratively updated to
minimize the difference between the raw projection and estimated projection.
Both numerical simulations and experimental head phantom are used to evaluate
the proposed method. The results indicate that the method provides accurate
estimate of the spectrum and it may be attractive for dose calculations,
artifacts correction and other clinical applications.

the complete information about the initial state of the matter cannot be
retrieved by future asymptotic observers, through local measurements. This is
contrary to the expectation from a unitary evolution in quantum theory and
leads to (a version of) the black hole information paradox. Classically,
nothing else, apart from mass, charge and angular momentum is expected to be
revealed to such asymptotic observers after the formation of a black hole.
Semi-classically, black holes evaporate after their formation through the
Hawking radiation. The dominant part of the radiation is expected to be thermal
and hence one cannot know anything about the initial data from the resultant
radiation. However, there can be sources of distortions which make the
radiation non-thermal. Although the distortions are not strong enough to make
the evolution unitary, these distortions carry some part of information
regarding the in-state. In this work, we show how one can decipher the
information about the in-state of the field from these distortions. We show
that the distortions of a particular kind --- which we call {\it non-vacuum
distortions} --- can be used to \emph{fully} reconstruct the initial data. The
asymptotic observer can do this operationally by measuring certain well-defined
observables of the quantum field at late times. We demonstrate that a general
class of in-states encode all their information content in the correlation of
late time out-going modes. Further, using a $1+1$ dimensional CGHS model to
accommodate back-reaction self-consistently, we show that observers can also
infer and track the information content about the initial data, during the
course of evaporation, unambiguously. Implications of such information
extraction are discussed.

studied in time-reversal symmetric topological insulators. Due to spin-orbit
coupling in the quantum spin Hall systems and three-dimensional topological
insulators, the magnetic susceptibility has crossed (intersectional) components
between spin and orbital part of magnetism. In this study, the crossed
susceptibility for the orbital magnetization is studied in two- and
three-dimensional topological insulator models, in which an external magnetic
field interacts with the electron spin by Zeeman coupling via distinct
g-factors for conduction and valence energy bands. The crossed susceptibility
in two-dimensional quantum spin Hall insulators shows a quantized signature of
the $\mathbb{Z}_2$ topological phase in response to Zeeman coupling via an
averaged g-factor, and the quantization persists even when
$\sigma^z$-conservation of electrons is broken by a tilted magnetic field. The
bulk orbital magnetization is interpreted by the persistent edge current
attributed to the chiral anomaly at the (1+1)-dimensional boundary. In
three-dimensional topological insulators, we found that the crossed
susceptibility is proportional to the difference of g-factors of conduction and
valence electrons, which is qualitatively different from the two-dimensional
case. Steep changes of the crossed susceptibility in three dimensions at the
phase transition points are explained by the surface Dirac fermion theory.
Finally, dependence of the crossed susceptibility on g-factors in two- and
three-dimensional cases is discussed from the viewpoint of time-reversal and
particle-hole symmetries.

derived from the phase of the Gabor's analytic signal which is practically
obtained by the inverse Fourier transform. This study presents time-frequency
analysis by the Fourier transform which maps the time-domain signal into the
frequency-domain. In this study, we derive the time information from the phase
of the frequency-domain signal and obtain the time-frequency representation. In
order to obtain the time information in Fourier domain, we define the concept
of `frequentaneous time' which is frequency derivative of phase. This is very
similar to the group delay, which is also defined as frequency derivative of
phase and it provide physical meaning only when it is positive. The
frequentaneous time is always positive or negative depending upon whether
signal is defined for only positive or negative times, respectively. If a
signal is defined for both positive and negative times, then we divide the
signal into two parts, signal for positive times and signal for negative times.
The proposed frequentaneous time and Fourier transform based time-frequency
distribution contains only those frequencies which are present in the Fourier

H-shaped graphene samples due to the spin/valley Hall effect. Interestingly,
when the Fermi energy deviates from the Dirac point, $R_{NL}$ decreases to zero
much more rapidly compared with the local resistance $R_L$, and the well-known
relation of $R_{NL}\propto R_L^3$ is not satisfied. In this work, based on the
non-equilibrium Green's function method, we explain such transport phenomena in
the H-shaped graphene with Rashba spin-orbit coupling. When the Fermi energy is
near the Dirac point, the nonlocal resistance is considerably large and is much
sharper than the local one. Moreover, the relationship between the Rashba
effect and the fast decay of $R_{NL}$ compared with $R_L$ is further
investigated. We find that the Rashba effect does not contribute not only to
the fast decay but also to the peak of $R_{NL}$ itself. Actually, it is the
extremely small density of states near the Dirac point that leads to the large
peak of $R_{NL}$, while the fast decay results from the quasi-ballistic
mechanism. Finally, we revise the classic formula $R_{NL}\propto R_L^3$ by
replacing $R_{NL}$ with $R_{Hall}$, which represents the nonlocal resistance
merely caused by the spin Hall effect, and the relation holds well.

to this question and construct their famous B-H quantum cloning machine. The
B-H machine clones state of an arbitrary single qubit in optimal manner and
hence it is universal. Generalizing this machine for two-qubit system is
straightforward, but this procedure does not preserve quantum correlation
existing in bipartite state in optimal manner and also, during this procedure,
this machine loses its universality and becomes a state-dependent cloning
machine. In this paper we propose an optimal universal local quantum state

Context Fusion (LSTM-CF) Model that captures and fuses contextual information
from multiple channels of photometric and depth data, and ii) incorporating
this model into deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for end-to-end

respectively, captured by stacking several convolutional layers and a long
short-term memory layer; the memory layer encodes both short-range and
long-range spatial dependencies in an image along the vertical direction.
Another long short-term memorized fusion layer is set up to integrate the
contexts along the vertical direction from different channels, and perform
bi-directional propagation of the fused vertical contexts along the horizontal
direction to obtain true 2D global contexts. At last, the fused contextual
representation is concatenated with the convolutional features extracted from
the photometric channels in order to improve the accuracy of fine-scale
semantic labeling. Our proposed model has set a new state of the art, i.e.,

relay nodes. A compress-and-forward relaying strategy, named the VMAC scheme,
is employed, in which the BSs can either perform single-user compression or
Wyner-Ziv coding to quantize the received signals and send the quantization
bits to the CP via capacity-limited fronthaul links; the CP performs successive
decoding with either successive interference cancellation (SIC) receiver or
linear minimum-mean-square-error (MMSE) receiver. Under this setup, this paper
investigates the joint optimization of the transmit beamformers at the users
and the quantization noise covariance matrices at the BSs for maximizing the
network utility. A novel weighted minimum-mean-square-error successive convex
approximation (WMMSE-SCA) algorithm is first proposed for maximizing the
weighted sum rate under the user transmit power and fronthaul capacity
constraints with single-user compression. Assuming a heuristic decompression
order, the proposed algorithm is then adapted for optimizing the transmit
beamforming and fronthaul compression under Wyner-Ziv coding. This paper also
proposes a low-complexity separate design consisting of optimizing transmit
beamformers for the Gaussian vector multiple-access channel along with
per-antenna quantizers with uniform quantization noise levels across the
antennas at each BS. Numerical results show that with optimized beamforming and
fronthaul compression, C-RAN can significantly outperform conventional cellular
networks. Furthermore, the low complexity separate design already performs very
close to the optimized joint design in regime of practical interest.

Telescope (LAT) data for the pulsar binary PSR B1259-63/LS 2883. During the GeV
flares that occurred when the pulsar was in the periastron passages, we have
detected a 5--300 GeV component at $\simeq 5\sigma$ in emission from the
binary. The detection verifies the presence of the component that has been
marginally found in the previous studies of the binary. Furthermore, we have
discovered that this component was present even in the quiescent state of the
binary, specifically the mean anomaly phase 0.7--0.9. The component can be
described by a power law with photon index $\Gamma\sim 1.4$, and the flux in
the flares is approximately one order of magnitude higher than that in
quiescence. We discuss the origin of this component. It likely arises from the
inverse-Compton process: high-energy particles from the shock, due to the
interaction between the winds from the pulsar and massive companion, scatter
the seed photons from the companion to GeV/TeV energies. Based on this
scenario, model fits to the broad-band X-ray--to--TeV spectra of the binary in
the flaring and quiescent states are provided.

liquid crystal theories, this paper provides a new description of guiding
center dynamics (to lowest order). This new perspective is based on a rotation
gauge field (gyrogauge) that encodes rotations around the magnetic field. In
liquid crystal theory, an analogue rotation field is used to encode the
rotational state of rod-like molecules. Instead of resorting to sophisticated
tools (e.g. Hamiltonian perturbation theory and Lie series expansions) that
still remain essential in higher-order gyrokinetics, the present approach
combines the WKB method with a simple kinematical ansatz, which is then
replaced into the charged particle Lagrangian. The latter is eventually
averaged over the gyrophase to produce Littlejohn's guiding-center equations. A
crucial role is played by the vector potential for the gyrogauge field. A
similar vector potential is related to liquid crystal defects and is known as
`wryness tensor' in Eringen's micropolar theory.

symbolizing a spherical nucleus. This large deformation corresponds to the
so-called ferro-deformation that occurs at the particular critical points over
the nuclear chart. By comparisons with the ferra-deformation at the critical
point Z = 40, N = 64 [arXiv:1604.02786], we draw a conclusion that shape phase
transitions should occur at Z = 18 or 20 when N = 36 to 38, which leads to a
ferro-deformation at the critical points of Z = 18 or 20, N = 40; 58Ar, 60Ca.
We explain the shape phase transition in terms of isospin dependent
spin-orbital interactions between neutrons in the f5/2 orbital and protons in
the f7/2 orbital. We find a universal behavior over the nuclear chart for
yielding the ferro-deformation such that; Z = 64, N = 104, Z = 40, N = 64, and
Z = 20, N = 40, respectively. This feature is linked to concept of the
neutron(n)-proton(p)interaction in spin-orbital couplings such that;
nh9/2-ph11/2, ng7/2-pg9/2, and nf5/2-pf7/2, respectively. It is suggested that

volatility can be predicted at all, and if so, when it can be predicted. The
exercise has been performed for the Indian stock market on daily data for two
years. For our analysis we map number of clusters against number of variables.
We then test for efficiency of clustering. Our contention is that, given a
fixed number of variables, one of them being historic volatility of NIFTY
returns, if increase in the number of clusters improves clustering efficiency,
then volatility cannot be predicted. Volatility then becomes random as, for a
given time period, it gets classified in various clusters. On the other hand,
if efficiency falls with increase in the number of clusters, then volatility
can be predicted as there is some homogeneity in the data. If we fix the number
of clusters and then increase the number of variables, this should have some
impact on clustering efficiency. Indeed if we can hit upon, in a sense, an
optimum number of variables, then if the number of clusters is reasonably
small, we can use these variables to predict volatility. The variables that we
consider for our study are volatility of NIFTY returns, volatility of gold
returns, India VIX, CBOE VIX, volatility of crude oil returns, volatility of
DJIA returns, volatility of DAX returns, volatility of Hang Seng returns and

interference (ISI) is a well known severe problem that deteriorates both data
rates and link reliability. ISI mainly occurs due to the slow and highly random
propagation of the messenger molecules, which causes the emitted molecules from
the previous symbols to interfere with molecules from the current symbol. An
effective way to mitigate the ISI is using enzymes to degrade undesired
molecules. Prior work on ISI mitigation by enzymes has assumed an infinite
amount of enzymes randomly distributed around the molecular channel. Taking a
different approach, this paper assumes an MCvD channel with a limited amount of
enzymes. The main question this paper addresses is how to deploy these enzymes
in an effective structure so that ISI mitigation is maximized. To find an
effective MCvD channel environment, this study considers optimization of the
shape of the transmitter node, the deployment location and structure, the size
of the enzyme deployed area, and the half-lives of the enzymes. It also
analyzes the dependence of the optimum size of the enzyme area on the distance
and half-life.

anonymous networks, the task of leader election is formulated as follows: every
node v of the network must output a simple path, which is coded as a sequence
of port numbers, such that all these paths end at a common node, the leader. In
this paper, we study deterministic leader election in arbitrary anonymous
networks. It is well known that leader election is impossible in some networks,
regardless of the allocated amount of time, even if nodes know the map of the
network. However, even in networks in which it is possible to elect a leader
knowing the map, the task may be still impossible without any knowledge,
regardless of the allocated time. On the other hand, for any network in which
leader election is possible knowing the map, there is a minimum time, called
the election index, in which this can be done. Informally, the election index
of a network is the minimum depth at which views of all nodes are distinct. Our
aim is to establish tradeoffs between the allocated time $\tau$ and the amount
of information that has to be given a priori to the nodes to enable leader
election in time $\tau$ in all networks for which leader election in this time
is at all possible. Following the framework of algorithms with advice, this
information is provided to all nodes at the start by an oracle knowing the
entire network. The length of this string (its number of bits) is called the
size of advice. For a given time $\tau$ allocated to leader election, we give
upper and lower bounds on the minimum size of advice sufficient to perform
leader election in time $\tau$. We focus on the two sides of the time spectrum
and give tight (or almost tight) bounds on the minimum size of advice for these
extremes. We also show that constant advice is not sufficient for leader
election in all graphs, regardless of the allocated time.

Spatially correlated intensity variation and warp variation are modeled as
random effects, resulting in a nonlinear mixed-effects model that enables
simultaneous estimation of template and model parameters by optimization of the
likelihood function. We propose an algorithm for fitting the model which
alternates estimation of variance parameters and image registration. This
approach avoids the potential estimation bias in the template estimate that
arises when treating registration as a preprocessing step. We apply the model
to datasets of facial images and 2D brain magnetic resonance images to
illustrate the simultaneous estimation and prediction of intensity and warp

determine characteristic sizes of the gas disks and column densities of all
molecules using a parametric power-law disk model. Our study is mostly
sensitive to molecules at 200-400 au from the stars. We compare the derived
column densities to the predictions of an extensive gas-grain chemical disk
model, under conditions representative of T Tauri disks. This survey provides
20 new detections of HCO$^+$ in disks, 18 in HCN, 11 in C$_2$H, 8 in CS and 4
in SO. HCO$^+$ is detected in almost all sources, and its J=3-2 line is
essentially optically thick, providing good estimates of the disk radii. The
other transitions are (at least partially) optically thin. Variations of the
column density ratios do not correlate with any specific property of the star
or disk. Disks around Herbig Ae stars appear less rich in molecules than those
around T Tauri stars, although the sample remains small. SO is only found in
the (presumably younger) embedded objects, perhaps reflecting an evolution of
the S chemistry due to increasing depletion with time. Overall, the molecular
column densities, and in particular the CN/HCN and CN/C$_2$H ratios, are well
reproduced by gas-grain chemistry in cold disks. This study provides a census
of simple molecules in disks of radii $> 200-300$ au. Extending that to smaller
disks, or searching for less abundant or more complex molecules requires a much
more sensitive facility, i.e. NOEMA and ALMA.

successful as a bulk ice model in reproducing the observed abundances of
various deuterated gas-phase species toward starless cores. Methods. We
calculate abundances for various deuterated species as functions of time
adopting fixed physical conditions. We also estimate abundance gradients by
adopting a modified Bonnor-Ebert sphere as a core model. In the multilayer ice
scenario, we consider desorption from one or several monolayers on the surface.
Results. We find that the multilayer model predicts abundances of $\rm DCO^+$
and $\rm N_2D^+$ that are about an order of magnitude lower than observed,
caused by the trapping of CO and $\rm N_2$ into the grain mantle. As a result
of the mantle trapping, deuteration efficiency in the gas phase increases and
we find stronger deuterium fractionation in ammonia than what has been
observed. Another distinguishing feature of the multilayer model is that $\rm
D_3^+$ becomes the main deuterated ion at high density. The bulk ice model is
generally easily reconciled with observations. Conclusions. Our results
underline that more theoretical and experimental work is needed to understand
the composition and morphology of interstellar ices, and the desorption
processes that can act on them. With the current constraints, the bulk ice
model appears to be better in reproducing observations than the multilayer ice
model. According to our results, the $\rm H_2D^+$ to $\rm N_2D^+$ abundance
ratio is higher than 100 in the multilayer model, while only a few $\times$ 10
in the bulk model, and so observations of this ratio could provide information
on the ice morphology in starless cores. Observations of the abundance of $\rm
D_3^+$ compared to $\rm H_2D^+$ and $\rm D_2H^+$ would provide additional
constraints for the models.

direction-of-arrival(DOA) of the narrowband far-field signals, a novel array
receiver architecture is presented by the concept of the sub-Nyquist sampling
techniques. In particular, our contribution is threefold. i) First, we propose
a time-space union signal reception model for receiving array signals, where
the sub-Nyquist sampling techniques and arbitrary array geometries are employed
to decrease the time-domain sampling rate and improve the DOA estimation
accuracy. A better joint estimation is obtained in the higher time-space union
space. ii) Second, two joint estimation algorithms are proposed for the
receiving model. One is based on a trilinear decomposition from the third-order
tensor theory and the other is based on subspace decomposition. iii) Third, we
derive the corresponding Cram\'er\text{-}Rao Bound (CRB) for frequency and DOA
estimates. In the case of the branch number of our architecture is equal to the
reduction factor of the sampling rate, it is observed that the CRB is robust in
terms of the number of signals, while the CRB based on the Nyquist sampling
scheme will increase with respect to the number of signals. In addition, the
new steer vectors of the union time-space model are completely uncorrelated
under the limited number of sensors, which improves the estimation performance.
Furthermore, the simulation results demonstrate that our estimates via the
receiver architecture associated with the proposed algorithms closely match the
CRB according to the noise levels, the branch number and the source number as
well.

that are as secure as their source-level counterparts. Full abstraction is the
most widely-proven property when defining a secure compiler. A compiler is
modular if it allows different components to be compiled independently and then
to be linked together to form a whole program. Unfortunately, many existing
fully-abstract compilers to untyped machine code are not modular. So, while
fully-abstractly compiled components are secure from malicious attackers, if
they are linked against each other the resulting component may become
vulnerable to attacks. This paper studies how to devise modular, fully-abstract
compilers. It first analyses the attacks arising when compiled programs are
linked together, identifying security threats that are due to linking. Then, it
defines a compiler from an object-based language with method calls and dynamic
memory allocation to untyped assembly language extended with a memory isolation
mechanism. The paper provides a proof sketch that the defined compiler is
fully-abstract and modular, so its output can be linked together without

applications to improve the data security. In this paper, we use the idea of
data randomization to proactively randomize the spectrum (re)allocation to
improve connections' security. As it is well-known that random (re)allocation
fragments the spectrum and thus increases blocking in elastic optical networks,
we analyze the tradeoff between system performance and security. To this end,
in addition to spectrum randomization, we utilize an on-demand defragmentation
scheme every time a request is blocked due to the spectrum fragmentation. We
model the occupancy pattern of an elastic optical link (EOL) using a
multi-class continuous-time Markov chain (CTMC) under the random-fit spectrum
allocation method. Numerical results show that although both the blocking and
security can be improved for a particular so-called randomization process (RP)
arrival rate, while with the increase in RP arrival rate the connections'
security improves at the cost of the increase in overall blocking.

particle with a magnetic moment $\mu$ in the cosmic string spacetime is
reexamined by applying the von Neumann theory of self--adjoint extensions.
Contrary to previous studies where the interaction between the spin and the
line of charge is neglected, here we consider its effects. This interaction
gives rise to a point interaction: $\boldsymbol{\nabla} \cdot \mathbf{E}=
(2\lambda/\alpha)\delta(r)/r$. Due to the presence of the Dirac delta function,
by applying an appropriated boundary condition provided by the theory of
self--adjoint extensions, irregular solutions for the Hamiltonian are allowed.
We address the scattering problem obtaining the phase shift, S-matrix and the
scattering amplitude. The scattering amplitude obtained shows a dependency with
energy which stems from the fact that the helicity is not conserved in this
system. Examining the poles of the S-matrix we obtain an expression for the
bound states. The presence of bound states for this system has not been
discussed before in the literature.

boundary singularities and remove unnecessary uniformity conditions occurring
in earlier works; to this end, we obtain a useful characterization of local
pseudofunctions. Most of our results are proved under one-sided Tauberian
hypotheses; in this context, we also establish new boundedness theorems for
Laplace transforms with pseudomeasure boundary behavior. As an application, we
refine various results related to the Katznelson-Tzafriri theorem for power
series.

to keff, provided a peripheral fuel rod is considered (i.e. far from the

our results show that, for keff> 0.7, the ratio calculated for LFR or GFR

all operational conditions, in particular for subcritical systems with
different types of neutron source and different values of the beam current.

the plasma condition in the heliosphere and the neighboring local interstellar
medium. The first IBEX results revealed an arc-like enhancement of the ENA
intensity in the sky, known as the ribbon. The ribbon was not expected from the
heliospheric models prior to the IBEX launch. One of the proposed explanations
of the ribbon is the mechanism of the secondary ENA emission. The ribbon
reveals energy-dependent structure in the relative intensity along its
circumference and in the position. Namely, the ribbon geometric center varies
systematically by about 10$^\circ$ in the energy range 0.7-4.3 keV. Here, we
show by analytic modeling that this effect is a consequence of the
helio-latitudinal structure of the solar wind reflected in the secondary ENAs.
Along with a recently measured distance to the ribbon source just beyond the
heliopause, our findings support the connection of the ribbon with the local
interstellar magnetic field by the mechanism of the secondary ENA emission.
However, the magnitude of the center shift in the highest IBEX energy channel
is much larger in the observations than expected from the modeling. This may be
due to another, not currently recognized, process of ENA generation.

for each synapse in parallel and in real-time.
  The processor uses this pre-processing to compute new weights possibly using
additional information following its program.
  Therefore, learning rules can be defined in software giving a large degree of

  Synapses realize correlation detection geared towards Spike-Timing Dependent

  Operating at a speed-up factor of 1000 compared to biological time-scale, we
measure time-constants from tens to hundreds of micro-seconds.

  glioma invasion: in silico insights",,,,,"q-bio.TO","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  There is an ongoing debate on the therapeutic potential of vaso-modulatory
interventions against glioma invasion. Prominent vasculature-targeting
therapies involve functional tumour-associated blood vessel deterioration and
normalisation. The former aims at tumour infarction and nutrient deprivation
medi- ated by vascular targeting agents that induce occlusion/collapse of
tumour blood vessels. In contrast, the therapeutic intention of normalising the
abnormal structure and function of tumour vascular net- works, e.g. via
alleviating stress-induced vaso-occlusion, is to improve chemo-, immuno- and
radiation therapy efficacy. Although both strategies have shown therapeutic
potential, it remains unclear why they often fail to control glioma invasion
into the surrounding healthy brain tissue. To shed light on this issue, we
propose a mathematical model of glioma invasion focusing on the interplay
between the mi- gration/proliferation dichotomy (Go-or-Grow) of glioma cells
and modulations of the functional tumour vasculature. Vaso-modulatory
interventions are modelled by varying the degree of vaso-occlusion. We
discovered the existence of a critical cell proliferation/diffusion ratio that
separates glioma invasion re- sponses to vaso-modulatory interventions into two
distinct regimes. While for tumours, belonging to one regime, vascular
modulations reduce the tumour front speed and increase the infiltration width,
for those in the other regime the invasion speed increases and infiltration
width decreases. We show how these in silico findings can be used to guide
individualised approaches of vaso-modulatory treatment strategies and thereby
improve success rates.

also used in decision-making and elections. The traditional computational
question, that asks to compute a draw (optimal draw) that maximizes the winning
probability for a distinguished player, has received a lot of attention.
Previous works consider the problem where the pairwise winning probabilities
are known precisely, while we study how robust is the winning probability with
respect to small errors in the pairwise winning probabilities. First, we
present several illuminating examples to establish: (a)~there exist
deterministic tournaments (where the pairwise winning probabilities are~0 or~1)
where one optimal draw is much more robust than the other; and (b)~in general,
there exist tournaments with slightly suboptimal draws that are more robust
than all the optimal draws. The above examples motivate the study of the
computational problem of robust draws that guarantee a specified winning
probability. Second, we present a polynomial-time algorithm for approximating
the robustness of a draw for sufficiently small errors in pairwise winning
probabilities, and obtain that the stated computational problem is NP-complete.
We also show that two natural cases of deterministic tournaments where the
optimal draw could be computed in polynomial time also admit polynomial-time
algorithms to compute robust optimal draws.

Deep Tracking, a recently proposed theoretical framework for end-to-end space
occupancy prediction. We show that by learning to track on a large amount of
unsupervised data, the network creates a rich internal representation of its
environment which we in turn exploit through the principle of inductive
transfer of knowledge to perform the task of it's semantic classification. As a
result, we show that only a small amount of labelled data suffices to steer the
network towards mastering this additional task. Furthermore we propose a novel
recurrent neural network architecture specifically tailored to tracking and
semantic classification in real-world robotics applications. We demonstrate the
tracking and classification performance of the method on real-world data
collected at a busy road junction. Our evaluation shows that the proposed
end-to-end framework compares favourably to a state-of-the-art, model-free
tracking solution and that it outperforms a conventional one-shot training
scheme for semantic classification.

planets using planetary transit timing variations (TTVs) and transit duration
variations (TDVs). For planets with one moon, measurements from successive
transits exhibit a hitherto undescribed pattern in the TTV-TDV diagram,
originating from the stroboscopic sampling of the planet's orbit around the
planet-moon barycenter. This pattern is fully determined and analytically
predictable after three consecutive transits. The more measurements become
available, the more the TTV-TDV diagram approaches an ellipse. For planets with
multiple moons in orbital mean motion resonance (MMR), like the Galilean moons,
the pattern is much more complex and addressed numerically in this report.
Exomoons in MMR can also form closed, predictable TTV-TDV figures if the drift
of the moons' pericenters is sufficiently slow. We find that MMR exomoons
produce loops in the TTV-TDV diagram and that the number of these loops is
equal to the order of the MMR, or the largest integer in the MMR ratio. We use
a Bayesian model and Monte Carlo simulations to test the discoverability of
exomoons using TTV-TDV diagrams with current and near-future technology. In a
blind test, two of us (BP, DA) successfully retrieved a large moon from
simulated TTV-TDV by co-authors MH and RH, which resembled data from a known
Kepler planet candidate. Single exomoons with a 10% moon-to-planet mass ratio,
like to Pluto-Charon binary, can be detectable in the archival data of the
Kepler primary mission. Multi-exomoon systems, however, require either larger
telescopes or brighter target stars. Complementary detection methods invoking a
moon's own photometric transit or its orbital sampling effect can be used for
validation or falsification. A combination of TESS, CHEOPS, and PLATO data
would offer a compelling opportunity for exomoon discoveries around bright
stars.

are presented systematically, assuming a packetized system. It is shown that
FEC-assisted decoding can improve frame error rate of successive cancellation
decoding arbitrarily, at the expense of some coding rate loss and decoding
complexity linearly increasing with the number of codewords in the frame. This
is compared with list decoding whose complexity grows linearly with the list
size as well as the number of codewords. Thereafter, the frame construction
procedure and decoding algorithm are developed in a realistic framework. Taking
into consideration the effective throughput of the transmission protocol, the
problem of optimal design of concatenated codes is formulated under polar code
length, frame length and target frame-success-rate constraints. Simulations are
performed assuming both additive white Gaussian noise and Rayleigh fading
channels. It is shown that the divide-concatenate strategy for long frames does
not lead to any considerable gain. It is also shown that the performance of

continuous-time Markov chains. System statistics of these Markov chains usually
cannot be calculated analytically and therefore estimates must be generated via
simulation techniques. There is a well documented class of simulation
techniques known as exact stochastic simulation algorithms, an example of which
is Gillespie's direct method. These algorithms often come with high
computational costs, therefore approximate stochastic simulation algorithms
such as the tau-leap method are used. However, in order to minimise the bias in
the estimates generated using them, a relatively small value of tau is needed,
rendering the computational costs comparable to Gillespie's direct method.
  The multi-level Monte Carlo method (Anderson and Higham, Multiscale Model.
Simul. 10:146-179, 2012) provides a reduction in computational costs whilst
minimising or even eliminating the bias in the estimates of system statistics.
This is achieved by first crudely approximating required statistics with many
sample paths of low accuracy. Then correction terms are added until a required
level of accuracy is reached. Recent literature has primarily focussed on
implementing the multi-level method efficiently to estimate a single system
statistic. However, it is clearly also of interest to be able to approximate
entire probability distributions of species counts. We present two novel

find a minimum size subgraph of $G$ that contains a path from each vertex of
$R$ to each vertex of $T$. The special case of this problem with $q=1$ is the
well known \textsc{Directed Steiner Tree} problem, while the special case with

  We first show that the problem is W[1]-hard with respect to $|T|$ for any $q
\ge 2$. Then we restrict ourselves to instances with $R \subseteq T$.
Generalizing the methods of Feldman and Ruhl [SIAM J. Comput. 2006], we present
an algorithm for this restriction with running time $O(2^{2q+4|T|}\cdot
n^{2q+O(1)})$, i.e., this restriction is FPT with respect to $|T|$ for any
constant $q$. We further show that we can, without significantly affecting the
achievable running time, loosen the restriction to only requiring that in the
solution there are a vertex $v$ and a path from each vertex of $R$ to $v$ and
from $v$ to each vertex of~$T$.
  Finally, we use the methods of Chitnis et al. [SODA 2014] to show that the

duration (lifetime). This issue causes hot-spots in the network, affecting
negatively the Flow Completion Time (FCT) and the throughput, the two key
performance metrics in data center networks. Previous work on load balancing
proposed solutions such as splitting long flows into short flows, using
per-packet forwarding approaches, and isolating the paths of short and long
flows. We propose DiffFlow, a new load balancing solution which detects long
flows and forwards packets using Random Packet Spraying (RPS) with help of SDN,
whereas the flows with small duration are forwarded with ECMP by default. The
use of ECMP for short flows is reasonable, as it does not create the
out-of-order problem; at the same time, RPS for long flows can efficiently help
to load balancing the entire network, given that long flows represent most of
the traffic in DCNs. The results show that our DiffFlow solution outperforms
both the individual usage of either RPS or ECMP, while the overall throughput
achieved is maintained at the level comparable to RPS.

variable nodes (VNs) are resolved in every iteration than with BP. The decrease
of erased VNs during the decoding process is analyzed instead of resolvable
equations. This quantity can also be derived with density evolution, resulting
in a drastic decrease in complexity. Finally, a scaling law using this quantity
is established for spatially coupled LDPC codes.

magnetic field in cylindrical geometry. The magnetic field model consists of an
unperturbed reversed-shear helical part and a perturbation consisting of a
superposition of modes. Contrary to most of the previous studies, the particle
trajectories are computed by directly solving the full Lorentz force equations
of motion in a six-dimensional phase space using a sixth-order, implicit,
symplectic Gauss-Legendre method. The level of stochasticity in the particle
orbits is diagnosed using averaged, effective Poincare sections. It is shown
that when only one mode is present the particle orbits can be stochastic even
though the magnetic field line orbits are not stochastic. The lack of
integrability of the particle orbits in this case is related to separatrix
crossing and the breakdown of the global conservation of the magnetic moment.
Some perturbation consisting of two modes creates resonance overlapping,
leading to Hamiltonian chaos in magnetic field lines. Then, the particle orbits
exhibit a nontrivial dynamics depending on their energy and pitch angle. It is
shown that the regions where the particle motion is stochastic decrease as the
energy increases. The non-monotonicity of the $q$-profile implies the existence
of magnetic ITBs which correspond to shearless flux surfaces located in the
vicinity of the $q$-profile minimum. It is shown that depending on the energy,
these magnetic ITBs might or might not confine particles. That is, magnetic
ITBs act as an energy-dependent particle confinement filter. Magnetic field
lines in reversed-shear configurations exhibit topological bifurcations due to
separatrix reconnection. We show that a similar but more complex scenario
appears in the case of particle orbits that depends in a non-trivial way on the
energy and pitch angle of the particles.

origins of storm moisture remains unclear. Existing studies have focused on the
region 40-400 km from the cyclone center. It is known that the rainfall within

moisture. Nonetheless, the dynamics of this imported moisture appears unknown.
Here, considering a region up to three thousand kilometers from storm center,
we analyze precipitation, atmospheric moisture and movement velocities for
North Atlantic hurricanes. Our findings indicate that even over such large
areas a hurricane's rainfall cannot be accounted for by concurrent evaporation.
We propose instead that a hurricane consumes pre-existing atmospheric water
vapor as it moves. The propagation velocity of the cyclone, i.e. the difference
between its movement velocity and the mean velocity of the surrounding air
(steering flow), determines the water vapor budget. Water vapor available to
the hurricane through its movement makes the hurricane self-sufficient at about
700 km from the hurricane center obviating the need to concentrate moisture
from greater distances. Such hurricanes leave a dry wake, whereby rainfall is
suppressed by up to 40 per cent compared to its long-term mean. The inner
radius of this dry footprint approximately coincides with the radius of
hurricane self-sufficiency with respect to water vapor. We discuss how Carnot
efficiency considerations do not constrain the power of such open systems that
deplete the pre-existing moisture. Our findings emphasize the incompletely
understood role and importance of atmospheric moisture supplies, condensation
and precipitation in hurricane dynamics.

onto the surface of dust grains, play an important role for planet growth and
bulk composition in protoplanetary disks. They can already be observed in the
envelopes of the much younger, low-mass Class 0 protostars that are still in
their early phase of heavy accretion. Aims. We aim at using the information on
the sublimation regions of different kinds of ices to understand the chemistry
of the envelope, its temperature and density structure, and the history of the
accretion process. Methods. As part of the CALYPSO IRAM Large Program, we have
obtained observations of C$^{18}$O, N$_2$H$^+$ and CH$_3$OH towards nearby
Class 0 protostars with the IRAM Plateau de Bure interferometer at
sub-arcsecond resolution. For four of these sources we have modeled the
emission using a chemical code coupled with a radiative transfer module.
Results. We observe an anti-correlation of C$^{18}$O and N$_2$H$^+$ in NGC
1333-IRAS4A, NGC 1333-IRAS4B, L1157, and L1448C, with N$_2$H$^+$ forming a ring
around the centrally peaked C$^{18}$O emission due to N$_2$H$^+$ being
chemically destroyed by CO. The emission regions of models and observations
match for a CO binding energy of 1200 K, which is higher than the binding
energy of pure CO ices ($\sim$855 K). Furthermore, we find very low CO
abundances inside the snow lines in our sources, about an order of magnitude
lower than the total CO abundance observed in the gas on large scales in
molecular clouds before depletion sets in. Conclusions. The high CO binding
energy may hint at CO being frozen out in a polar ice environment like
amorphous water ice or in non-polar CO$_2$-rich ice. The low CO abundances are
comparable to values found in protoplanetary disks, which may indicate an
evolutionary scenario where these low values are already established in the
protostellar phase. (Abbr. Version)

$\exp(-r^{2})$. These basis functions are used extensively, e.g., in
biomolecular dynamic simulations. However, to the present, there is no reliable
algorithm available to compute the Fourier coefficients of a function with
respect to the SGL basis functions in a fast way. This paper presents such
generalized FFTs. We start out from an SGL sampling theorem that permits an
exact computation of the SGL Fourier expansion of bandlimited functions. By a
separation-of-variables approach and the employment of a fast spherical Fourier
transform, we then unveil a general class of fast SGL Fourier transforms. All
of these algorithms have an asymptotic complexity of $\mathcal{O}(B^{4})$, $B$
being the respective bandlimit, while the number of sample points on
$\mathbb{R}^{3}$ scales with $B^{3}$. This clearly improves the naive bound of
$\mathcal{O}(B^{7})$. At the same time, our approach results in fast inverse
transforms with the same asymptotic complexity as the forward transforms. We
demonstrate the practical suitability of our algorithms in a numerical
experiment. Notably, this is one of the first performances of generalized FFTs

that they are aligned instead of pointing in random directions as expected.
This discovery has been confirmed and the significance of the correlations
enhanced. We devoted this doctoral thesis to an in-depth analysis of these
striking observations that imply Gpc-scale correlations. We developed a new and
independent statistical method which is dedicated to the study and the
characterization of the distribution of the orientations of vectorial
quantities that are perpendicular to the lines of sight of a set of sources
spread on the celestial sphere. This allowed us to confirm independently the
large-scale polarization-vector alignments and to refine the limits of the
alignment regions through an unbiased characterization of the signal. We also
provided a detailed analysis of a large sample of polarization measurements
made at radio wavelengths in which similar polarization-vector alignments are
found. The regions of alignments of the quasar-radio-polarization vectors are
found to be close to these of optical alignments. This might suggest that
quasar axes themselves could be aligned. Based on new observations, we further
analyzed the optical-polarization vectors of quasars that belong to two large
groups. Taking into account the link between the optical-polarization vectors
and the morphologies of the quasars, we found that the spin axes of the quasars
align with the axis of the large-quasar group to which they belong. We
reinforced our findings using radio-polarization data and a large sample of
large-quasar groups. We additionally found that the preferred orientations of
the quasar spin axes depend on the richness of their host groups.

hydrogen, as low as $10^{-4}$ cm$^{-3}$, penetrate inside the pulsar wind, this
is sufficient to strongly affect the tail flow. Mass loading leads to the fast
expansion of the pulsar wind tail, making the tail flow intrinsically
non-stationary. The shapes predicted for the bow shock nebulae compare well
with observations, both in H$\alpha$ and X-rays.

qubits and an environmental spin chain (with periodic boundary condition) to
which these central qubits are locally and weakly connected either at the same
site or at two different sites separated by a distance $d$. Our purpose is to
study the subsequent temporal generation of entanglement, quantified by
concurrence, when initially the qubits are in an unentangled state. In the
equilibrium situation, we show that the concurrence survives for a larger value
of $d$ when the environmental spin chain is critical. Importantly, a common
feature observed both in the equilibrium and the non-equilibrium situations
while the latter is created by a sudden but global change of the environmental
transverse field, is that the two qubits become maximally entangled for the
critical quenching. Following a non-equilibrium evolution of the spin chain,
our study for $d\neq 0$, indicates that there exists a threshold time above
which concurrence attains a finite value. Additionally, we show that the number
of independent decohering channels (DCs) is determined by $d$ as well as the
local difference of the transverse field of the two underlying Hamiltonians
governing the time evolution. The qualitatively similar behavior displayed by
the concurrence for critical and off-critical quenches, as reported here, is
characterized by analyzing the non-equilibrium evolution of these channels. The
concurrence is maximum when the decoherence factor or the echo associated with
the most rapidly DC decays to zero; on the contrary, the condition when the
concurrence vanishes is determined non-trivially by the associated decay of one
of the intermediate DCs. Analyzing the reduced density of a single qubit, we
also explain the observation that the dephasing rate is always slower than the

However, utilization of these large bandwidths and of large antenna arrays can

generally considered as the most power consuming block. In this paper,
primarily focusing on the ADC power, we analyze and compare the total power
consumption of the complete analog chain for Analog, Digital and Hybrid

consumption of these beamforming schemes varies with a change in the number of

compare low power (as in [1]) and high power (as in [2]) ADC models, and show
that for a certain range of number of antennas, b and B, DBF may actually have
a comparable and lower power consumption than ABF and HBF, respectively. In
addition, we also show how the choice of an appropriate beamforming scheme
depends on the signal-to-noise ratio regime.

expressed as a single scaling function of the ratio of temperature to magnetic
field $T/B$ over four decades even in the approximant crystal when some
condition is satisfied by varying parameters, e.g., by applying pressure. The
key origin is clarified to be due to the strong locality of the critical
Yb-valence fluctuation and small Brillouin zone reflecting the large unit cell,
giving rise to the extremely-small characteristic energy scale. This also gives
a natural explanation for the quantum criticality in the quasicrystal
corresponding to the infinite limit of the unit-cell size.

superposition transmission scheme for future 5G cellular networks, which we
refer to as the lattice partition multiple access (LPMA). In this proposed
design, the base station transmits multilevel lattice codes for multiple users.
Each user's code level corresponds to a distinct prime and is weighted by a
product of all distinct primes of the other users excluding its own. Due to the
structural property of lattice codes, each user can cancel out the interference
from the other code levels by using the modulo lattice operation in a
successive/parallel manner. LPMA can overcome the drawback of non-orthogonal
multiple access (NOMA), which arises when users have similar channel
conditions. We demonstrate that the proposed LPMA shows a clear throughput
enhancement over the current NOMA scheme.

sequences, by the fact that it can produce an upper bound on the ensemble value

switch. If the node fires, then it sends a feedback result depending on the
input signal strength. If the input signal is positive or larger, it can store
an 'on' switch feedback for the next iteration. If the signal is negative or
smaller, it can store an 'off' switch feedback for the next iteration. If the
node does not fire, then it does not affect the current feedback situation and
receives the switch command produced by the last active pattern event for the
same neuron. The upper bound therefore also represents the largest or most
enclosing pattern set and the lower value is for the actual set of firing
patterns. If the pattern sequence repeats, it will oscillate between the two
values, allowing them to be recognised and measured more easily, over time.
Tests show that changing the sequence ordering produces different value sets,
which can also be measured.

We believe the paper represents the first systematic study of the effect of two

to all prefixes of the input. This is quantified through competitive analyses
of online algorithms against two optimal algorithms, both knowing the entire

bipartite, planar, and general graphs, we obtain tight results in almost all

significance of the necessary requirement that online algorithms be

properties. In this work, we use hydrodynamical simulations to investigate the
quenching of disk galaxies through ram-pressure stripping (RPS) as they fall
into galaxy clusters with the goal of characterising the importance of this
effect for the reddening of disk galaxies. Our set-up employs a live model of a
galaxy cluster that interacts with infalling disk galaxies on different orbits.
We use the moving-mesh code AREPO, augmented with a special refinement strategy
to yield high resolution around the galaxy on its way through the cluster in a
computationally efficient way. Our direct simulations differ substantially from
stripping models employed in current SAMs, which in most cases overpredict the
mass loss from RPS. Furthermore, after pericentre passage, as soon as ram
pressure becomes weaker, gas that remains bound to the galaxy is redistributed
to the outer parts, an effect that is not captured in simplified treatements of
RPS. Star formation in our model galaxies is quenched mainly because the hot
gas halo is stripped, depriving the galaxy of its gas supply. The cold gas disk
is only stripped completely in extreme cases, leading to full quenching and
significant reddening on timescale of ~200 Myr. On the other hand, galaxies
experiencing only mild ram pressure actually show an enhanced star formation
rate that is consistent with observations and are quenched on timescales > 1
Gyr. Stripped gas in the wake is mixed efficiently with intracluster gas
already a few tens of kpc behind the disk, and this gas is free of residual
star formation.

space together with a representation of the observable algebra including
operators of quantum geometry. In particular, we consider the holonomy-flux
algebra of (2+1)-dimensional Euclidean loop quantum gravity, and construct a
new representation of this algebra that incorporates a positive cosmological
constant. The vacuum state underlying our representation is defined by the
Turaev-Viro TQFT. We therefore construct here a generalization, or more
precisely a quantum deformation at root of unity, of the previously-introduced
SU(2) BF representation. The extended Turaev-Viro TQFT provides a description
of the excitations on top of the vacuum, which are essential to allow for a
representation of the holonomies and fluxes. These excitations agree with the
ones induced by massive and spinning particles, and therefore the framework
presented here allows automatically for a description of the coupling of such
matter to (2+1)-dimensional gravity with a cosmological constant. The new
representation presents a number of advantages over the representations which
exist so far. It possesses a very useful finiteness property which guarantees
the discreteness of spectra for a wide class of quantum (intrinsic and
extrinsic) geometrical operators. The notion of basic excitations leads to a
fusion basis which offers exciting possibilities for constructing states with
interesting global properties. The work presented here showcases how the
framework of extended TQFTs can help design new representations and understand
the associated notion of basic excitations. This is essential for the
construction of the dynamics of quantum gravity, and will enable the study of
possible phases of spin foam models and group field theories from a new
perspective.

comparison, the conventional Lagrange multiplier method is considered as
Globally Imposing Scheme (GIS) because its added constraint term exhibits a
global impact to its objective function. Two advantages are gained from LIS
over GIS. First, LIS enables constraints to fire locally and explicitly in the
domain only where they need on the prediction function. Second, constraints can
be implemented within a network setting directly. We attempt to interpret
several constraint methods graphically from a viewpoint of the locality
principle. Numerical examples confirm the advantages of the proposed method. In
solving boundary value problems with Dirichlet and Neumann constraints, the
GCNN model with LIF is possible to achieve an exact satisfaction of the

on the spreading process among individuals. First, the pathogen or information
can be transmitted to more individuals through different layers at one time,
which enlarges the spreading scope. Second, through different layers, an
individual can also transmit the pathogen or information to the same
individuals more than once at one time, which makes the spreading more
effective. To understand the different roles of the spreading scope and
effectiveness, we propose an epidemic model on multiplex networks with link
overlapping, where the spreading effectiveness of each interaction as well as
the variety of channels (spreading scope) can be controlled by the number of
overlapping links. We find that for Poisson degree distribution, increasing the
epidemic scope (the first effect) is more efficient than enhancing epidemic
probability (the second effect) to facilitate the spreading process. However,
for power-law degree distribution, the effects of the two factors on the
spreading dynamics become complicated. Enhancing epidemic probability makes
pathogen or rumor easier to outbreak in a finite system. But after that
increasing epidemic scopes is still more effective for a wide spreading.
Theoretical results along with reasonable explanation for these phenomena are
all given in this paper, which indicates that the epidemic scope could play an
important role in the spreading dynamics.

into account the competition among reaction, diffusion and evaporation. The
model predictions are confronted to ice observations in the envelope of
low-mass and massive young stellar objects as well as toward background stars.
Modelled gas-phase abundances are compared to species observed toward TMC-1
(CP) and L134N dark clouds. We find that our model successfully reproduces the
observed ice species. It is found that the reaction-diffusion competition
strongly enhances reactions with barriers and more specifically reactions with
H2, which is abundant on grains. This finding highlights the importance to have
a good approach to determine the abundance of H2 on grains. Consequently, it is
found that the major N-bearing species on grains go from NH3 to N2 and HCN when
the reaction-diffusion competition is accounted. In the gas-phase and before
few 10^5 yrs, we find that the 3-phase model does not have a strong impact on
the observed species compared to the 2-phase model. After this time, the
computed abundances dramatically decrease due to the strong accretion on dust,
which is not counterbalanced by the desorption less efficient than in the
2-phase model. This strongly constrains the chemical-age of cold cores to be of
the order of few 10^5 yrs.

event in Solar Cycle 24. Two successive coronal mass ejections (CMEs) have been
detected close in time. From the multi-point in-situ observations, it can be
found that this SEP event was caused by the first CME, and the second one was
not involved. Using the velocity dispersion analysis (VDA), we find that for
well magnetically connected point, the energetic protons and electrons are
released nearly at the same time. The path lengths to STEREO-B(STB) of protons
and electrons have distinct difference and deviate remarkably from the nominal
Parker spiral path length, which is likely due to the presence of
interplanetary magnetic structures situated between the source and the STB.
Also the VDA method seems only to obtain reasonable results at well-connected
locations and the inferred energetic particles release times in different
energy channels are similar. We suggest that good-connection is crucial for
obtaining both accurate release time and path length simultaneously, agreeing
with the modeling result of Wang & Qin (2015).

three-dimensional Monte-Carlo radiative transfer code. POLARIS was designed to
calculate dust temperature, polarization maps, and spectral energy
distributions. It is optimized to handle data that results from sophisticated
magneto-hydrodynamic simulations. The main purpose of the code is to prepare
and analyze multi-wavelength continuum polarization measurements in the context
of magnetic field studies in the interstellar medium. An exemplary application
is the investigation of the role of magnetic fields in star formation
processes.
  Methods: We combine currently discussed state-of-the-art grain alignment
theories with existing dust heating and polarization algorithms. We test the
POLARIS code on multiple scales in complex astrophysical systems that are
associated with different stages of star formation. POLARIS uses the full
spectrum of dust polarization mechanisms to trace the underlying magnetic field
morphology.
  Results: Resulting temperature distributions are consistent with the density
and position of radiation sources resulting from magneto-hydrodynamic (MHD) -
collapse simulations. The calculated layers of aligned dust grains in the
considered cirumstellar disk models are in excellent agreement with theoretical
predictions. Finally, we compute unique patterns in synthetic multi-wavelength
polarization maps that are dependent on applied dust-model and grain-alignment

It is an interesting open question to determine the exact threshold for the

recursive bias amplification by the 3-input majority function. It was not
obvious if other choice of function exhibits stronger bias amplification. We
show that the 3-input majority function is the unique optimal, so that one
cannot improve the threshold $\frac{3+\sqrt{6}}6$ by Brassard et al.'s bias

self-motile point particles, we derive meso-scale continuum equations by
applying a spatial averaging version of the Irving--Kirkwood--Noll procedure.
Since the method does not rely on kinetic theory, the derivation is valid for
highly concentrated particle systems. Spatial averaging yields a stochastic
continuum equations similar to those of Toner and Tu. However, our theory also
involves a constitutive equation for the average fluctuation force. According
to this equation, both the strength and the probability distribution vary with
time and position through the effective mass density. The statistics of the
fluctuation force also depend on the fine scale dissipative force equation, the
physical temperature, and two additional parameters which characterize
fluctuation strengths. Although the self-propulsion force entering our DPD
model contains no explicit mechanism for aligning the velocities of neighboring
particles, our averaged coarse-scale equations include the commonly encountered
cubically nonlinear (internal) body force density.

ranging from two to seven dimensions, denoted as $D$. We impose that the length
of interdependent links connecting nodes in the two lattices be less than or
equal to a certain value, $r$. For each value of $D$ and $r$, we find the
mutual percolation threshold, $p_c[D,r]$ below which the system completely
collapses through a cascade of failures following an initial destruction of a
fraction $ (1-p)$ of the nodes in one of the lattices. We find that for each
dimension, $D<6$, there is a value of $r=r_I>1$ such that for $r\geq r_I$ the
cascading failures occur as a discontinuous first order transition, while for
$r<r_I$ the system undergoes a continuous second order transition, as in the
classical percolation theory. Remarkably, for $D=6$, $r_I=1$ which is the same
as in random regular (RR) graphs with the same degree (coordination number) of
nodes. We also find that in all dimensions, the interdependent lattices reach
maximal vulnerability (maximal $p_c[D,r]$) at a distance $r=r_{max}>r_I$, and
for $r>r_{max}$ the vulnerability starts to decrease as $r\to\infty$. However
the decrease becomes less significant as $D$ increases and
$p_c[D,r_{max}]-p_c[D,\infty]$ decreases exponentially with $D$. We also
investigate the dependence of $p_c[D,r]$ on the system size as well as how the
nature of the transition changes as the number of lattice sites, $N\to\infty$.

natural generalization of the well known Abelian gauge group symmetry $U(1)$ in

self-interacting electron. In connection with this theory, I would like attract
the attention to the state-dependent gauge transformations $U(1) \times U(N-1)$
associated with the Jacobi vector fields of the geodesic variations in the
complex projective Hilbert space $CP(N-1)$ of the unlocated quantum states
