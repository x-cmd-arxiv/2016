the anode, is among the most promising technologies for next generation
electrochemical energy storage devices due to its high energy density,
particularly when Li is paired with energetic conversion cathodes such as
sulfur, oxygen/air, and carbon dioxide. Practical LMBs in any of these designs
remain elusive due to multiple stubborn problems, including parasitic reactions
of Li metal with liquid electrolytes, unstable/dendritic electrodeposition at
the anode during cell recharge, and chemical reaction of dissolved cathode
conversion products with the Li anode. The solid electrolyte interface (SEI)
formed between lithium metal and liquid electrolytes plays a critical role in
all of these processes. We report on the chemistry and interfacial properties
of artificial SEI films created by in-situ reaction of a strong Lewis Acid AlI3
additive, Li metal, and aprotic liquid electrolytes. We find that these SEI
films impart exceptional interfacial stability to a Li metal anode. We further
show that the improvements come from at least three processes: (i) in-situ
formation of Li-Al alloy, (ii) formation of a LiI salt layer on Li, and (iii)
creation of a stable polymer thin film on the lithium metal anode.

framework of the development of a smarter grid, the primary focus of the
present study is to propose a model for the electrical daily demand in presence
of PHEVs charging. Expected PHEV demand is modeled by the PHEV charging time
and the starting time of charge according to real world data. A normal
distribution for starting time of charge is assumed. Several distributions for
charging time are considered: uniform distribution, Gaussian with positive
support, Rician distribution and a non-uniform distribution coming from driving
patterns in real-world data. We generate daily demand profiles by using
real-world residential profiles throughout 2014 in the presence of different
expected PHEV demand models. Support vector machines (SVMs), a set of
supervised machine learning models, are employed in order to find the best
model to fit the data. SVMs with radial basis function (RBF) and polynomial

controversial, the general direction holds promise. This commentary clarifies
points of disagreement and unresolved issues, and addresses mis-applications of
evolutionary theory that lead the authors to adopt a Darwinian (versus
Lamarckian) approach. To say that creativity is Darwinian is not to say that it
consists of variation plus selection---in the everyday sense of the term---as
the authors imply; it is to say that evolution is occurring because selection
is affecting the distribution of randomly generated heritable variation across
generations. In creative thought the distribution of variants is not key, i.e.,
one is not inclined toward idea A because 60% of one's candidate ideas are
variants of A while only 40% are variants of B; one is inclined toward
whichever seems best. The authors concede that creative variation is partly
directed; however, the greater the extent to which variants are generated
non-randomly, the greater the extent to which the distribution of variants can
reflect not selection but the initial generation bias. Since each thought in a
creative process can alter the selective criteria against which the next is
evaluated, there is no demarcation into generations as assumed in a Darwinian
model. We address the authors' claim that reduced variability and individuality
are more characteristic of Lamarckism than Darwinian evolution, and note that a
Lamarckian approach to creativity has addressed the challenge of modeling the
emergent features associated with insight.

semimetals can be further classified into two types. In the type I Weyl
semimetals, a topologically protected linear crossing of two bands, i.e., a
Weyl point, occurs at the Fermi level resulting in a point-like Fermi surface.
In the type II Weyl semimetals, the Weyl point emerges from a contact of an
electron and a hole pocket at the boundary resulting in a highly tilted Weyl
cone. In type II Weyl semimetals, the Lorentz invariance is violated and a
fundamentally new kind of Weyl Fermions is produced that leads to new physical
properties. WTe2 is interesting because it exhibits anomalously large
magnetoresistance. It has ignited a new excitement because it is proposed to be
the first candidate of realizing type II Weyl Fermions. Here we report our

(ICO) and one-dimensional lattice (1DL) strategies, using both uniform and
non-uniform quantization of the interference signal, are studied. It is shown
that, in contrast to typical scalar quantization of Gaussian sources, a
non-uniform quantizer, whose quantization intervals become smaller as we go
further from zero, improves the performance. Given that the optimal decoder is
the minimum MSE (MMSE) estimator, a necessary condition for the optimality of
the encoder is derived, and the numerically optimized encoder (NOE) satisfying
this condition is obtained. Based on the numerical results, it is shown that
1DL with non-uniform quantization performs closer (compared to the other
schemes) to the numerically optimized encoder while requiring significantly
lower complexity.

food products artificially low, in order to help the poor to buy their food.
But it became soon clear that such system, although helpful for the city poor,
was disastrous for the peasants (who usually are even poorer), so that hunger
increased, instead of decreasing. More recently, thus, higher prices have been
imposed. But a high-price system does not solve the problems. It helps, indeed,
a peasant to buy in the city non-edible products, but not to buy (more
expensive) food products from other peasants. The question is discussed here in
more detail starting from the simplest conceivable case of two peasants
producing each a different food product (bread and cheese, say), then
generalizing to several food items and to any number of peasants producing a
given food item j. Like in every economic system which wants to be sustainable,
or able to reproduce itself in a stationary state at least, prices are
determined by the necessity of exchanging ""means of production"" among
""industries"", except that here industriesare replaced by working peasants and
means of production are replaced by food. It is found that prices must obey
certain inequalities related to the minimal amount of each food item necessary
for survival. Inequalities may be rewritten as equations and, in an important
special case, such equations give rise to a simple version of the matrix
equation used by famous authors to describe the economy.

sky. Classifying them reliably is however a challenging task due to
degeneracies in WISE multicolour space and low levels of detection in its two
longest-wavelength bandpasses. Here we aim at obtaining comprehensive and
reliable star, galaxy and quasar catalogues based on automatic source
classification in full-sky WISE data. This means that the final classification
will employ only parameters available from WISE itself, in particular those
reliably measured for a majority of sources. For the automatic classification
we applied the support vector machines (SVM) algorithm, which requires a
training sample with relevant classes already identified, and we chose to use
the SDSS spectroscopic dataset for that purpose. By calibrating the classifier
on the test data drawn from SDSS, we first established that a polynomial kernel
is preferred over a radial one for this particular dataset. Next, using three
classification parameters (W1 magnitude, W1-W2 colour, and a differential
aperture magnitude) we obtained very good classification efficiency in all the
tests. At the bright end, the completeness for stars and galaxies reaches ~95%,
deteriorating to ~80% at W1=16 mag, while for quasars it stays at a level of
~95% independently of magnitude. Similar numbers are obtained for purity.
Application of the classifier to full-sky WISE data, flux-limited to 16 mag
(Vega) in the 3.4 {\mu}m channel, and appropriate a posteriori cleaning allowed
us to obtain reliably-looking catalogues of star and galaxy candidates.
However, the sources flagged by the classifier as `quasars' are in fact
dominated by dusty galaxies but also exhibit contamination from sources located
mainly at low ecliptic latitudes, consistent with Solar System objects.

capabilities this field has dramatically grown in the last twenty years.
However many 3D computations, especially at high frequency and/or long range,
are still far beyond current reach and force researchers to resort to
approximations, for example by working in 2D (plane strain) or by using a
paraxial approximation. This article presents and validates a numerical
technique based on an axisymmetric formulation of a spectral finite-element
method in the time domain for heterogeneous fluid-solid media. Taking advantage
of axisymmetry enables the study of relevant 3D configurations at a very
moderate computational cost. The axisymmetric spectral-element formulation is
first introduced, and validation tests are then performed. A typical
application of interest in ocean acoustics showing upslope propagation above a
dipping viscoelastic ocean bottom is then presented. The method correctly
models backscattered waves and explains the transmission losses discrepancies
pointed out in Jensen et al. (2007). Finally, a realistic application to a

increases, while each UE intermittently accesses the network, the random access
functionality becomes essential to share the limited number of pilots among the

resolution (SUCRe). An accessing UE asks for a dedicated pilot by sending an
uncoordinated random access pilot, with a risk that other UEs send the same
pilot. The favorable propagation of Massive MIMO channels is utilized to enable
distributed collision detection at each UE, thereby determining the strength of
the contenders' signals and deciding to repeat the pilot if the UE judges that
its signal at the receiver is the strongest. The SUCRe protocol resolves the
vast majority of all pilot collisions in crowded urban scenarios and continues
to admit UEs efficiently in overloaded networks.

of each player in the network plays an important role. If they exist, hubs
often determine the fate of the population in remarkable ways. Recent research
based on optimal percolation in random networks has shown, however, that the
degree is neither the sole nor the best predictor of influence in complex
networks. Low-degree nodes may also be optimal influencers if they are
hierarchically linked to hubs. Taking this into account leads to the formalism
of collective influence in complex networks, which as we show here, has
far-reaching implications for the favorable resolution of social dilemmas. In
particular, there exists an optimal hierarchical depth for the determination of
collective influence that we use to describe the potency of players for passing
their strategies, which depends on the strength of the social dilemma.
Interestingly, the degree, which corresponds to the baseline depth zero, is
optimal only when the temptation to defect is small. Our research reveals that
evolutionary success stories are related to spreading processes which are
rooted in favorable hierarchical structures that extend beyond local

S-RNN uses a framework that skips through the images in the photo stream to
explore the space of all ordered subsets of the albums via an efficient

short-term correlations, and recovers the latent story more accurately. We show
how our learned storylines can be used to analyze, predict, and summarize photo

mechanism in shaping galaxy evolution. Fast, extended outflows are frequently
detected in the AGN host galaxies at all redshifts and luminosities, both in
ionised and molecular gas. However, these outflows are only ""potentially"" able
to quench star formation and we are still missing a decisive evidence of
negative feedback in action. Here we present Spectrograph for INtegral Field
Observations in the Near Infrared (SINFONI) H- and K-band integral-field
spectroscopic observations of two quasars at $z\sim$2.4 characterised by fast,
extended outflows detected through the [OIII]$\lambda$5007 line (Carniani et
al. 2015). The high signal-to-noise ratio of our observations allows us to
identify faint narrow (FWHM $< 500$ km/s), and spatially extended components in
[OIII]$\lambda$5007 and H$\alpha$ emission associated with star formation in
the host galaxy. Such star-formation powered emission is spatially
anti-correlated with the fast outflows. The ionised outflows therefore appear
to be able to suppress star formation in the region where the outflow is
expanding. However the detection of narrow, spatially-extended H$\alpha$
emission indicates star formation rates of at least $\sim 50-90$
M$_{\odot}$/yr, suggesting either that AGN feedback does not affect the whole
galaxy or that many feedback episodes are required before star formation is
completely quenched. On the other hand, the narrow H$\alpha$ emission extending
along the edges of the outflow cone may lead also to a positive feedback
interpretation. Our results highlight the possible twofold role of galaxy-wide
outflows in host galaxy evolution.

whose fibre is given as a cubic hypersurface in ${\rm Bl}_2{\mathbb P}^2$, with
the non-abelian gauge group factors SU(3)xSU(2) engineered torically via the
top construction. To describe gauge fluxes on these fibrations we provide a
classification of the primary vertical middle cohomology group in a fashion
valid for any choice of base space. Using the ideal theoretic technique of

expressions allow us to interpret the cancellation of the pure and mixed
non-abelian anomalies geometrically as a result of the general form of the

results for the chiral indices of all matter states are obtained in terms of
intersection numbers of the base and can be directly applied to any choice of

we present a novel nonlinear spectral unmixing method following the recent

related to interactions between different endmembers. The proposed unmixing
method is unsupervised in the sense that the endmembers are estimated jointly
with the abundances and other parameters of interest, i.e., the transition
probability of undergoing further interactions. Non-negativity and sum-to one
constraints are imposed on abundances while only nonnegativity is considered
for endmembers. The resulting unmixing problem is formulated as a constrained
nonlinear optimization problem, which is solved by a block coordinate descent
strategy, consisting of updating the endmembers, abundances and transition
probability iteratively. The proposed method is evaluated and compared with
linear unmixing methods for synthetic and real hyperspectral datasets acquired
by the AVIRIS sensor. The advantage of using non-linear unmixing as opposed to
linear unmixing is clearly shown in these examples.

small-scale magnetic field structures (`magnetic spots') in the polar cap
region. Their creation can proceed via crustal Hall drift out of two
qualitatively and quantitatively different initial magnetic field
configurations: a field confined completely to the crust and another which
penetrates the whole star. The aim of this study is to explore whether these
magnetic structures in the crust can deform the star sufficiently to make it an
observable source of gravitational waves. We model the evolution of these field
configurations, which can develop, within $\sim 10^4$ -- $10^5$ yr, magnetic
spots with local surface field strengths $\sim 10^{14}$ G maintained over
$\gtrsim 10^6$ yr. Deformations caused by the magnetic forces are calculated.
We show that, under favourable initial conditions, a star undergoing crustal
Hall drift can have ellipticity $\epsilon\sim 10^{-6}$, even with sub-magnetar
polar field strengths, after $\sim 10^5$ yr. A pulsar rotating at $\sim 10^2$
Hz with such $\epsilon$ is a promising gravitational-wave source candidate.
Since such large deformations can be caused only by a particular magnetic field
configuration that penetrates the whole star and whose maximum magnetic energy
is concentrated in the outer core region, gravitational wave emission observed
from radio pulsars can thus inform us about the internal field structures of
young neutron stars.

diagram. Strain can be used to selectively stabilize different VO$_2$
insulating phases by tuning the competition between electron and lattice
degrees of freedom. It can even break the mesoscopic spatial symmetry of the
transition, leading to a quasi-periodic ordering of insulating and metallic
nanodomains. Nanostructuring of strained VO$_2$ could potentially yield unique
components for future devices. However, the most spectacular property of VO$_2$
- its ultrafast transition - has not yet been studied on the length scale of
its phase heterogeneity. Here, we use ultrafast near-field microscopy in the

influence on national and international social and economic policies. Yet, due
to a relative lack of reliable, system wide data, many such theories remain, at
best, unvalidated and, at worst, misleading. In this paper, we introduce a
novel economic observatory and framework enabling high resolution comparisons
and assessments of the distributional impact of economic development through
the remote sensing of planet earth's surface. Striking visual and empirical
validation is observed for a broad, global macroeconomic sigma-convergence in
the period immediately following the end of the Cold War. What is more, we
observe strong empirical evidence that the mechanisms driving sigma-convergence
failed immediately after the financial crisis and the start of the Great
Recession. Nevertheless, analysis of both cross-country and cross-state samples
indicates that, globally, disproportionately high growth levels and excessively
high decay levels have become rarer over time. We also see that urban areas,
especially concentrated within short distances of major capital cities were
more likely than rural or suburban areas to see relatively high growth in the
aftermath of the financial crisis. Observed changes in growth polarity can be
attributed plausibly to post-crisis government intervention and subsidy
policies introduced around the world. Overall, the data and techniques we
present here make economic evidence for the rise of China, the decline of U.S.

spacetime with Ricci curvature $R=12H$, averaged over horizon sized regions of
physical volume $V_H=\frac{4\pi}{3}\left(\frac{1}{H}\right)^3$, can be
interpreted as Brownian motion in a medium with de Sitter temperature
$T_{DS}=\frac{\hbar H}{2\pi}$. We demonstrate this by directly deriving the
effective action of scalar field fluctuations with wavelengths larger than the
de Sitter curvature radius and generalizing Starobinsky's seminal results on
stochastic inflation. The effective action describes stochastic dynamics and
the fluctuating force drives the field to an equilibrium characterized by a
thermal Gibbs distribution at temperature $T_{DS}$ which corresponds to a de
Sitter invariant state. Hence, approach towards this state can be interpreted
as thermalization. We show that the stochastic kinetic energy of the
coarse-grained description corresponds to the norm of $\partial_\mu\phi$ and
takes a well defined value per horizon volume $\frac{1}{2}\langle
\left(\nabla\phi\right)^2\rangle = - \frac{1}{2}T_{DS}/V_H$. This approach
allows for the non-perturbative computation of the de Sitter invariant stress
energy tensor $\langle T_{\mu\nu} \rangle$ for an arbitrary scalar potential.

propose a novel Riemannian optimization framework by exploiting the quotient

During the excitation, the atoms grasp different phases which depend on the
spatial positions of the atoms in the cavity. Due to strong resonant
interaction between two atoms and optical cavity mode the absorbed input photon
can be efficiently transferred from the atoms to the resonant cavity mode. We
show that the quantum transfer is highly sensitive to the external excitation
phases of atoms and it leads to quantum interference effects on the cavity mode
excitation. Besides, the quantum transfer is also influenced by the
dipole-dipole interaction dependent to the atomic distance. In this system the
atomic positions also determine the coupling constants between atoms and cavity
mode which causes additional interference effects to the photon exchange
between atoms and cavity. Based on the characteristics of excitation phase we
find that it is a feasible scheme to generate long-lived dark state and it

deep CNN- based approaches take the whole size-normalized image as input and
have achieved quite promising results. Compared with the previously dominating
approaches based on feature extraction, pooling, and classification, the deep
CNN-based approaches mainly rely on the learning capability of deep CNN to
achieve superior results: the burden of minimizing intra-class variation while
maximizing inter-class difference is entirely dependent on the implicit feature
learning component of deep CNN; we rely upon the implicitly learned filters and
pooling component to select the discriminative regions, which correspond to the
activated neurons. However, if the irrelevant regions constitute a large

discriminate region as a latent variable. We can jointly learn the global CNN
with the latent CNN to avoid the aforementioned big irrelevant region issue,

interpersonal relations, and are widely used in behavior interpretation of
emotions, cognitive science, and social interactions. In this paper we analyze
different ways of representing geometric feature and present a fully automatic
facial expression recognition (FER) system using salient geometric features. In
geometric feature-based FER approach, the first important step is to initialize
and track dense set of facial points as the expression evolves over time in
consecutive frames. In the proposed system, facial points are initialized using
elastic bunch graph matching (EBGM) algorithm and tracking is performed using
Kanade-Lucas-Tomaci (KLT) tracker. We extract geometric features from point,
line and triangle composed of tracking results of facial points. The most
discriminative line and triangle features are extracted using feature selective
multi-class AdaBoost with the help of extreme learning machine (ELM)
classification. Finally the geometric features for FER are extracted from the
boosted line, and triangles composed of facial points. The recognition accuracy
using features from point, line and triangle are analyzed independently. The
performance of the proposed FER system is evaluated on three different data
sets: namely CK+, MMI and MUG facial expression data sets.

  We make the following contributions. (i) First, we evaluate different
variations of a fully convolutional residual network so as to find the best
configuration, including the number of layers, the resolution of feature maps,
and the size of field-of-view. Our experiments show that further enlarging the
field-of-view and increasing the resolution of feature maps are typically
beneficial, which however inevitably leads to a higher demand for GPU memories.
To walk around the limitation, we propose a new method to simulate a high

training and/or testing. (ii) Second, we propose an online bootstrapping method
for training. We demonstrate that online bootstrapping is critically important
for achieving good accuracy. (iii) Third we apply the traditional dropout to
some of the residual blocks, which further improves the performance. (iv)

repetition theorem was known. We prove that the entangled value of a two-player

important role in the performance analysis of Markov systems, where $P$ is the
transition probability matrix, $e$ is the column vector of ones, and $\pi$ is
the row vector of the steady state distribution. It is used to compute the
performance potential (relative value function) of Markov decision processes
under the average criterion, such as $g=(I - P + e \pi)^{-1} f$ where $g$ is
the column vector of performance potentials and $f$ is the column vector of

the fundamental matrix as $(I - P + e r)^{-1}$, where $r$ can be any given row
vector satisfying $r e \neq 0$. With this generalized fundamental matrix, we
can compute $g=(I - P + e r)^{-1} f$. The steady state distribution is computed
as $\pi = r(I - P + e r)^{-1}$. The Q-factors at every state-action pair can
also be computed in a similar way. These formulas may give some insights on
further understanding how to efficiently compute or estimate the values of $g$,

nonequilibrium critical behavior that is well described incredibly by its

developed to account for the behavior. The weak driving may give rise to
several time scales depending on its form and thus rich nonequilibrium
phenomena of various regimes and their crossovers, negative susceptibilities,
as well as violation of fluctuation-dissipation theorem. An initial condition
that can be in either equilibrium or nonequilibrium but has longer correlations

April, using long-term RXTE X-ray data and simultaneous optical/near-infrared

black hole binaries, as it has an inferred launch radius which is a factor of
10 smaller than the thermal wind prediction. However, the optical and
near-infrared fluxes monotonically increase around the Chandra observation,
whereas the X-ray flux monotonically decreases from 10 days beforehand. Yet the
optical and near-infrared fluxes are from the outer, irradiated disk, so for
them to increase implies that the X-rays likewise increased. We applied a new
irradiated disk model to the multi-wavelength spectral energy distributions
(SEDs). Fitting the optical and near-infrared fluxes, we estimated the
intrinsic luminosity at the Chandra epoch was > ~0.7 L_Edd, which is more than
one order of magnitude larger than the observed X-ray luminosity. These results
could be explained if a Compton-thick, almost completely ionized gas was
present in the wind and strong scattering reduced the apparent X-ray
luminosity. The effects of scattering in the wind should then be taken into
account for discussion of the wind-driving mechanism. Radiation pressure and
Compton heating may also contribute to powering the wind at this high
luminosity.

The
superconducting transition temperature $T_c$ of LiFeAs decreases rapidly at a
rate of 7 K per 1\% V. The Hall coefficient of LiFeAs switches from negative to
positive with 4.2\% V doping, showing that V doping introduces hole carriers.
This observation is further confirmed by the evaluation of the Fermi surface
volume measured by angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES), from
which a 0.3 hole doping per V atom introduced is deduced. Interestingly, the
introduction of holes does not follow a rigid band shift. We also show that the
temperature evolution of the electrical resistivity as a function of doping is
consistent with a crossover from a Fermi liquid to a non-Fermi liquid. Our
ARPES data indicate that the non-Fermi liquid behavior is mostly enhanced when
one of the hole $d_{xz}/d_{yz}$ Fermi surfaces is well nested by the
antiferromagnetic wave vector to the inner electron Fermi surface pocket with
the $d_{xy}$ orbital character. The magnetic susceptibility of

Further, the statistical properties of the new estimators have been analyzed

Fixed some typos",,,,"cs.MA cs.AI cs.CC cs.CY cs.DS","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The Coalitional Manipulation problem has been studied extensively in the
literature for many voting rules. However, most studies have focused on the
complete information setting, wherein the manipulators know the votes of the
non-manipulators. While this assumption is reasonable for purposes of showing
intractability, it is unrealistic for algorithmic considerations. In most
real-world scenarios, it is impractical for the manipulators to have accurate
knowledge of all the other votes. In this paper, we investigate manipulation
with incomplete information. In our framework, the manipulators know a partial
order for each voter that is consistent with the true preference of that voter.
In this setting, we formulate three natural computational notions of
manipulation, namely weak, opportunistic, and strong manipulation. We say that
an extension of a partial order is if there exists a manipulative vote for that
extension.
  1. Weak Manipulation (WM): the manipulators seek to vote in a way that makes
their preferred candidate win in at least one extension of the partial votes of
the non-manipulators.
  2. Opportunistic Manipulation (OM): the manipulators seek to vote in a way
that makes their preferred candidate win in every viable extension of the
partial votes of the non-manipulators.
  3. Strong Manipulation (SM): the manipulators seek to vote in a way that
makes their preferred candidate win in every extension of the partial votes of
the non-manipulators.
  We consider several scenarios for which the traditional manipulation problems
are easy (for instance, Borda with a single manipulator). For many of them, the
corresponding manipulative questions that we propose turn out to be
computationally intractable. Our hardness results often hold even when very
little information is missing, or in other words, even when the instances are
quite close to the complete information setting.

internal viscous incompressible flows, widely known as Moffatt vortices was
thought to be infinite. However, the already existing and most recent geometric
theories on incompressible viscous flows that express vortical structures in
terms of critical points in bounded domains, indicate a strong opposition to
this notion of infiniteness. In this study, we endeavor to bridge the gap
between the two opposing stream of thoughts by addressing what might have gone
wrong and pinpoint the shortcomings on the assumptions of the existing theorems
on Moffatt vortices. We provide our own set of proofs for establishing the
finiteness of the sequence of Moffatt vortices by making use of the continuum
hypothesis and Kolmogorov scale, which guarantee a non-zero scale for the
smallest vortex structure possible in incompressible viscous flows. We point
out that the notion of infiniteness resulting from discrete self-similarity of
the vortex structures is not physically feasible. The centers of these vortices
have been quantified by us as fixed points through Brouwer fixed-point theorem
and boundary of a vortex as circle cell. With the aid of these new developments
and making use of some existing theorems in topology along with some elementary
concept of mathematical analysis, we provide several approaches to delve into
this issue. All these approaches converge to the same conclusion that the
sequence of Moffatt vortices cannot be infinite; in fact, it is at most finite.

infer that the first and second observations belong to the island state and
lower banana state, respectively. During island state, a low-frequency
quasi-periodic oscillation (LFQPO) at $\sim4.53$ Hz is observed along with four
type-I X-ray bursts ($\sim 10-15$ s duration each). The X-ray luminosity of the
source during the island and lower banana states are found to be $L_{X}= 1.1$
and $1.6\times10^{37}$ erg s$^{-1}$, respectively which correspond to $\sim
6\%$ and $\sim 9\%$ of the Eddington luminosity. The combined burst spectrum is
well represented by a blackbody with a characteristic temperature of
$2.22\pm0.05\kev$ and the blackbody radius of $9.87\pm1.86$ km which is
consistent with the typical radius of the neutron star. The persistent energy
spectra from both observations in the energy band $1-79\kev$ are well described
with thermal emission from the NS surface ($kT_{bb}\simeq1-2.5\kev$),
Comptonized emission of thermal seed photons from the hot boundary layer/corona
and the strong reflection component from the accretion disc. We detect a broad
Iron line in the $5-8 \kev$ band and reflection hump in the $15-30 \kev$ band.
These features are well modelled by the {\tt relxill} reflection model. From
joint spectral fitting, we constrain the inclination angle of the binary system
and inner disc radius to be $22\degree-40\degree$ and $(2.8-4.3)\times

calculations, we propose a model to control the band gap size of
{\gamma}-graphyne. The model is named as p-n codoping, i. e., using B and N
atoms to codope into {\gamma}-graphyne. After codoping, B atom plays a role of
p doping and N atom acts as n doping. The Fermi energy level returns around the
forbidden zone and the band gap of {\gamma}-graphyne vary bigger or smaller.
Moreover, the gaps exhibit an oscillated behaviour in different codoping
configurations. The proposed model serves as new insights for better modulation
of the electronic properties of 2D carbon materials.

contains three images, i.e. one person and the matched/mismatch references. For
each triplet unit, the distance disparity between the matched pair and the
mismatched pair tends to be maximized. We solve this objective by building a
deep architecture of convolutional neural networks. In particular, the
Mahalanobis distance matrix is naturally factorized as one top fully-connected
layer that is seamlessly integrated with other bottom layers representing the

simultaneously optimized via the one-shot backward propagation. On several

individuals cross cameras against various challenges, and outperforms other

texts, is a fundamental problem for many NLP applications. Recently, deep
learning approach has been applied to this problem and significant improvements
have been achieved. In this paper, we propose to view the generation of the
global interaction between two texts as a recursive process: i.e. the
interaction of two texts at each position is a composition of the interactions
between their prefixes as well as the word level interaction at the current
position. Based on this idea, we propose a novel deep architecture, namely
Match-SRNN, to model the recursive matching structure. Firstly, a tensor is
constructed to capture the word level interactions. Then a spatial RNN is
applied to integrate the local interactions recursively, with importance
determined by four types of gates. Finally, the matching score is calculated
based on the global interaction. We show that, after degenerated to the exact
matching scenario, Match-SRNN can approximate the dynamic programming process
of longest common subsequence. Thus, there exists a clear interpretation for
Match-SRNN. Our experiments on two semantic matching tasks showed the
effectiveness of Match-SRNN, and its ability of visualizing the learned

While deep neural network approaches have recently demonstrated remarkable

computational costs (minutes of run-time for low-res images). Our paper
addresses this efficiency issue. Instead of a numerical deconvolution in
previous work, we precompute a feed-forward, strided convolutional network that
captures the feature statistics of Markovian patches and is able to directly
generate outputs of arbitrary dimensions. Such network can directly decode
brown noise to realistic texture, or photos to artistic paintings. With
adversarial training, we obtain quality comparable to recent neural texture
synthesis methods. As no optimization is required any longer at generation
time, our run-time performance (0.25M pixel images at 25Hz) surpasses previous
neural texture synthesizers by a significant margin (at least 500 times
faster). We apply this idea to texture synthesis, style transfer, and video
stylization.

model (HMM) based speech recognition/synthesis techniques. This allows
transmission of information (such as phonemes) segment by segment that
decreases the bit rate. However, the encoder based on a phoneme speech
recognition may create bursts of segmental errors. Segmental errors are further
propagated to optional suprasegmental (such as syllable) information coding.
Together with the errors of voicing detection in pitch parametrization,
HMM-based speech coding creates speech discontinuities and unnatural speech
sound artefacts.
  In this paper, we propose a novel VLBR speech coding framework based on
neural networks (NNs) for end-to-end speech analysis and synthesis without
HMMs. The speech coding framework relies on phonological (sub-phonetic)
representation of speech, and it is designed as a composition of deep and
spiking NNs: a bank of phonological analysers at the transmitter, and a
phonological synthesizer at the receiver, both realised as deep NNs, and a
spiking NN as an incremental and robust encoder of syllable boundaries for
coding of continuous fundamental frequency (F0). A combination of phonological
features defines much more sound patterns than phonetic features defined by
HMM-based speech coders, and the finer analysis/synthesis code contributes into
smoother encoded speech. Listeners significantly prefer the NN-based approach
due to fewer discontinuities and speech artefacts of the encoded speech. A
single forward pass is required during the speech encoding and decoding. The
proposed VLBR speech coding operates at a bit rate of approximately 360 bits/s.

Very large deformations can be introduced using microbridge devices. However,
at the microscale, strain values are commonly deduced from Raman spectroscopy
using empirical linear models only established up to 1.2% for uniaxial stress.
In this work, we calibrate the Raman-strain relation at higher strain using
synchrotron based microdiffraction. The Ge microbridges show unprecedented high
tensile strain up to 4.9 % corresponding to an unexpected 9.9 cm-1 Raman shift.
We demonstrate experimentally and theoretically that the Raman strain relation

homogeneous regions in an image, and have been subject to considerable
attention in the machine vision community. In this paper, a popular theoretical
model with it's origins in statistical physics and social dynamics, known as
the Deffuant-Weisbuch model, is applied to the image segmentation problem. The
Deffuant-Weisbuch model has been found to be useful in modelling the evolution
of a closed system of interacting agents characterised by their opinions or
beliefs, leading to the formation of clusters of agents who share a similar
opinion or belief at steady state. In the context of image segmentation, this
paper considers a pixel as an agent and it's colour property as it's opinion,
with opinion updates as per the Deffuant-Weisbuch model. Apart from applying
the basic model to image segmentation, this paper incorporates adjacency and
neighbourhood information in the model, which factors in the local similarity
and smoothness properties of images. Convergence is reached when the number of
unique pixel opinions, i.e., the number of colour centres, matches the
pre-specified number of clusters. Experiments are performed on a set of images
from the Berkeley Image Segmentation Dataset and the results are analysed both
qualitatively and quantitatively, which indicate that this simple and intuitive
method is promising for image segmentation. To the best of the knowledge of the
author, this is the first work where a theoretical model from statistical
physics and social dynamics has been successfully applied to image processing.

  ambient media",,,"10.1093/mnras/stw1082",,"astro-ph.GA","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Supernova (SN) blast waves inject energy and momentum into the interstellar
medium (ISM), control its turbulent multiphase structure and the launching of
galactic outflows. Accurate modelling of the blast wave evolution is therefore
essential for ISM and galaxy formation simulations. We present an efficient
method to compute the input of momentum, thermal energy, and the velocity
distribution of the shock-accelerated gas for ambient media with uniform (and
with stellar wind blown bubbles), power-law, and turbulent density
distributions. Assuming solar metallicity cooling, the blast wave evolution is
followed to the beginning of the momentum conserving snowplough phase. The
model recovers previous results for uniform ambient media. The momentum
injection in wind-blown bubbles depend on the swept-up mass and the efficiency
of cooling, when the blast wave hits the wind shell. For power-law density
distributions with $n(r) \sim$ $r^{-2}$ (for $n(r) > n_{_{\rm floor}}$) the
amount of momentum injection is solely regulated by the background density
$n_{_{\rm floor}}$ and compares to $n_{_{\rm uni}}$ = $n_{_{\rm floor}}$.
However, in turbulent ambient media with log-normal density distributions the
momentum input can increase by a factor of 2 (compared to the homogeneous case)
for high Mach numbers. The average momentum boost can be approximated as
$p_{_{\rm turb}}/\mathrm{p_{_{0}}}\ =23.07\, \left(\frac{n_{_{0,\rm
turb}}}{1\,{\rm cm}^{-3}}\right)^{-0.12} + 0.82
(\ln(1+b^{2}\mathcal{M}^{2}))^{1.49}\left(\frac{n_{_{0,\rm turb}}}{1\,{\rm

accelerated to high velocities in low-density channels. The model values agree
with results from recent, computationally expensive, three-dimensional
simulations of SN explosions in turbulent media.

low-mass X-ray binaries containing a neutron star (NS-LMXBs) are investigated

and 4U 1735$-$44) exhibit large hardness ratio (15--50 keV$/$2--10 keV: {\it
HR} $>$ 0.1), while the other sources distribute at {\it HR} $\ltsim$ 0.1. In
either case, {\it HR} does not depend on the 2--10 keV luminosity. Therefore
the difference of {\it HR} is due to the 15--50 keV luminosity, which is
Comptonized emission. The Compton cloud is assumed to be around the neutron
star. The size of the Compton cloud would affect the value of {\it HR}.
Although the magnetic field of NS-LMXB is weak, we could expect a larger
Alfv\'{e}n radius than the innermost stable circular orbit or the neutron star
radius in some sources. In such cases, the accretion inflow is stopped at the
Alfv\'{e}n radius and would create relatively large Compton cloud. It would
result in the observed larger Comptonized emission. By attributing the
difference of the size of Compton cloud to the Alfv\'{e}n radius, we can
estimate the magnetic fields of neutron star. The obtained lower/upper limits
are consistent with the previous results.

preference ordering over a set of items and one would like to know these
preference orderings for various tasks, for example, data analysis, preference
aggregation, voting etc. However, we often have a large number of items which
makes it impractical to ask the agents for their complete preference ordering.
In such scenarios, we usually elicit these agents' preferences by asking (a
hopefully small number of) comparison queries --- asking an agent to compare
two items. Prior works on preference elicitation focus on unrestricted domain
and the domain of single peaked preferences and show that the preferences in
single peaked domain can be elicited by much less number of queries compared to
unrestricted domain. We extend this line of research and study preference
elicitation for single peaked preferences on trees which is a strict superset
of the domain of single peaked preferences. We show that the query complexity
crucially depends on the number of leaves, the path cover number, and the
distance from path of the underlying single peaked tree, whereas the other
natural parameters like maximum degree, diameter, pathwidth do not play any
direct role in determining query complexity. We then investigate the query
complexity for finding a weak Condorcet winner for preferences single peaked on
a tree and show that this task has much less query complexity than preference
elicitation. Here again we observe that the number of leaves in the underlying
single peaked tree and the path cover number of the tree influence the query
complexity of the problem.

propagation of time-harmonic fields of fixed finite frequency in the EME medium
is studied. It is shown that (if $\omega\neq 0$) the dispersion equation has a
cubic and homogeneous form, whence the wave vector $k$ is either zero or has
arbitrary magnitude. In many cases there is no dispersion equation (""NDE

study robustness of the resulting closed-loop system with respect to

well as scheduling protocols. For given plant-controller dynamics and
communication network properties (e.g., propagation delays and scheduling
protocols), we quantify the control performance level (in terms of Lp-gains) as
the transmission interval varies. Maximally Allowable Transfer Interval (MATI)
labels the greatest transmission interval for which a prescribed Lp-gain is
attained. The proposed methodology combines impulsive delayed system modeling
with Lyapunov-Razumikhin techniques to allow for MATIs that are smaller than
the communication delays. Other salient features of our methodology are the
consideration of variable delays, corrupted data and employment of model-based
estimators to prolong MATIs. The present stability results are provided for the
class of Uniformly Globally Exponentially Stable (UGES) scheduling protocols.
The well-known Round Robin (RR) and Try-Once-Discard (TOD) protocols are

  over FinFETs",,,,,"cs.ET","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  FinFET technology is prone to suffer from Line Edge Roughness (LER) based VT
variation with scaling. To address this, we proposed an Epitaxially Defined
(ED) FinFET (EDFinFET) as an alternate to FinFET architecture for 10 nm node
and beyond. We showed by statistical simulations that EDFinFET reduces LER
based VT variability by 90% and overall variability by 59%. However, EDFinFET
consists of wider fins as the fin widths are not constrained by electrostatics
and variability (cf. FinFETs have fin width ~ LG/3 where LG is gate-length).
This indicates that EDFinFET based circuits may be less dense. In this study we
show that wide fins enable taller fin heights. The ability to engineer multiple
STI levels on tall fins enables different transistor widths (i.e. various W/Ls
e.g. 1-10) in a single fin. This capability ensures that even though individual
EDFinFET devices have ~2x larger footprints than FinFETs, EDFinFET may produce
equal or higher circuit density for basic building blocks like inverters or
NAND gates for W/Ls of 2 and higher.

large frequency tunability of the STVO with respect to $f_{0}$ allowed the
device to be locked to multiple sub-harmonics of the microwave frequency
$f_{RF}$, or to the same sub-harmonic over a wide range of $f_{RF}$ by tuning
the DC current. In general, analysis of the locking range, linewidth, and
amplitude showed that the locking efficiency decreased as the harmonic number
increased, as expected for harmonic synchronization of a non-linear oscillator.

in the spatial character of the magnetization dynamics of states locked to the
fundamental and harmonic frequencies, suggesting significant differences in the
core trajectories within the same device. Super-harmonic injection locking of a
NC-STVO may open up possibilities for devices such as nanoscale frequency
dividers, while differences in the core trajectory may allow mutual
synchronisation to be achieved in multi-oscillator networks by tuning the

insider information, as well as to block malicious traffic from entering the

systems that inspect traffic. However, the state-of-the-art inspection systems
do not reflect well the interests of the different involved autonomous roles.
For example, employees in an enterprise, or a company outsourcing its network
management to a specialized third party, may require that their traffic remains
confidential, even from the system administrator. Moreover, the rules used by
the intrusion detection system, or more generally the configuration of an
online or offline anomaly detection engine, may be provided by a third party,
e.g., a security research firm, and can hence constitute a critical business
asset which should be kept confidential. Today, it is often believed that
accounting for these additional requirements is impossible, as they contradict
efficiency and effectiveness. We in this paper explore a novel approach, called
Privacy Preserving Inspection (PRI), which provides a solution to this problem,
by preserving privacy of traffic inspection and confidentiality of inspection
rules and configurations, and e.g., also supports the flexible installation of

method for measuring horizontal flows in the photosphere. This method exhibits
a systematic error that looks like a flow converging towards disk center, also
known as the shrinking-Sun effect.
  Aims. We aim at studying the nature of the shrinking-Sun effect for continuum
intensity data and at deriving a simple model that can explain its origin.
  Methods. We derived LCT flow maps by running the local correlation tracking
code FLCT on tracked and remapped continuum intensity maps provided by the
Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (HMI) onboard the Solar Dynamics Observatory.
We also computed flow maps from synthetic continuum images generated from
STAGGER code simulations of solar surface convection. We investigated the
origin of the shrinking-Sun effect by generating an average granule from
synthetic data from the simulations.
  Results. The LCT flow maps derived from HMI and from the simulations exhibit
a shrinking-Sun effect of comparable magnitude. The origin of this effect is
related to the apparent asymmetry of granulation originating from radiative
transfer effects when observing with a viewing angle inclined from vertical.
This causes, in combination with the expansion of the granules, an apparent
motion towards disk center.

that the effect of strain in the high-temperature Seebeck coefficient is small

However, the effective mass changes substantially with strain, which produces
an opposite effect to that of the degeneracy-breakups produced by strain. In
particular, we find that the thermopower can be enhanced by applying tensile
strain in the adequate regime. We conclude that the detrimental effect of

underlying assumption of the FV framework is that local descriptors are well
decorrelated within each cluster so that the covariance matrix for each
Gaussian can be simplified to be diagonal. Though the FV usually relies on the
Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to decorrelate local features, the PCA is
applied to the entire training data and hence it only diagonalizes the
\textit{universal} covariance matrix, rather than those w.r.t. the local
components. As a result, the local decorrelation assumption is usually not
supported in practice.
  To relax this assumption, this paper proposes a completed model of the Fisher
vector, which is termed as the Completed Fisher vector (CFV). The CFV is a more
general framework of the FV, since it encodes not only the variances but also
the correlations of the whitened local descriptors. The CFV thus leads to
improved discriminative power. We take the task of material categorization as
an example and experimentally show that: 1) the CFV outperforms the FV under
all parameter settings; 2) the CFV is robust to the changes in the number of
components in the mixture; 3) even with a relatively small visual vocabulary
the CFV still works well on two challenging datasets.

temperature-dependent excitation rate into the upper level of the transition.
Detectability of a line is contingent only on the ability of a molecule to
channel enough of the ambient thermal energy into the line and the excitation
can be computed in bulk by summing over rates without solving the multi-level
rate equations or computing optical depths and excitation temperatures. Results
for \hcop, HNC and CS are compared with escape-probability solutions of the
rate equations using closed-form expressions for the expected range of validity
of our {\it ansatz}, with the result that gas number densities as high as $10^4
\pccc$ or optical depths as high as 100 can be accommodated in some cases. For
densities below a well-defined upper bound, the range of validity of the
discussion can be cast as an upper bound on the line brightness which is 0.3 K
for the J=1-0 lines and 0.8 - 1.7 K for the J=2-1 lines of these species. The

limited to a few trusted individuals, greatly reducing its impact on biomedical
research. Privacy preserving methods have been suggested as a way of allowing
more people access to this precious data while protecting patients. In
particular, there has been growing interest in applying the concept of
differential privacy to GWAS results. Unfortunately, previous approaches for
performing differentially private GWAS are based on rather simple statistics
that have some major limitations. In particular, they do not correct for
population stratification, a major issue when dealing with the genetically
diverse populations present in modern GWAS. To address this concern we
introduce a novel computational framework for performing GWAS that tailors
ideas from differential privacy to protect private phenotype information, while
at the same time correcting for population stratification. This framework
allows us to produce privacy preserving GWAS results based on two of the most
commonly used GWAS statistics: EIGENSTRAT and linear mixed model (LMM) based
statistics. We test our differentially private statistics, PrivSTRAT and
PrivLMM, on both simulated and real GWAS datasets and find that they are able
to protect privacy while returning meaningful GWAS results.

In this paper, we seek to address the following questions: Does the globally
observed scale-free property of agricultural networks hold over smaller spatial
domains? Can similar properties be observed at kilometer to meter scales? We
analyze 9 intensively cultivated Landsat scenes on 5 continents with a wide
range of vegetation distributions. We find that networks of vegetation fraction
within the domain of each of these Landsat scenes exhibit substantial
variability - but still possess similar scaling properties to the global
distribution of agriculture. We also find similar results using a 39 km2 IKONOS

example of network disruption. We compare two networks with similar rank-size
distributions that behave differently when nodes are progressively removed. We
suggest that treating agricultural land cover as spatial networks can provide a
straightforward way of characterizing the connectivity of complex spatial

the stochastic system under consideration exposes a stiff behavior. That is why
stiff stochastic models are difficult to deal with and require effective state
estimation techniques to be designed yet.

hierarchy of diffusion equations is derived, the solutions of which yield
moments of the numbers of inflationary $e$-folds. Solving the resulting partial
differential equations in multi-dimensional field space is more challenging
than the single-field case. A few tractable examples are discussed, which show
that the number of fields is, in general, a critical parameter. When more than
two fields are present for instance, the probability to explore arbitrarily
large-field regions of the potential, otherwise inaccessible to single-field
dynamics, becomes non-zero. In some configurations, this gives rise to an
infinite mean number of $e$-folds, regardless of the initial conditions.
Another difference with respect to single-field scenarios is that multi-field
stochastic effects can be large even at sub-Planckian energy. This opens
interesting new possibilities for probing quantum effects in inflationary
dynamics, since the moments of the numbers of $e$-folds can be used to
calculate the distribution of primordial density perturbations in the

Kernel methods based on minimizing the regularized risk over a reproducing

tend to decouple and we find significant charge transfer between the layers. In
addition, this piezoelectric effect can be tuned by applying a perpendicular

produced in pp collisions at $\sqrt{s}=$ 13 TeV at the LHC using the ATLAS
experiment. The dataset used corresponds to an integrated luminosity of 3.2
fb$^{-1}$. Many extensions of the Standard Model predict the existence of
massive charged long-lived particles, such as $R$-hadrons. These massive
particles are expected to be produced with a velocity significantly below the
speed of light, and therefore to have a specific ionization higher than any
Standard Model particle of unit charge at high momenta. The Pixel subsystem of
the ATLAS detector is used to measure the ionization energy loss of
reconstructed charged particles and to search for such highly ionizing
particles. The search presented here has much greater sensitivity than a
similar search performed using the ATLAS detector in the $\sqrt{s}=$ 8 TeV
dataset, thanks to the increase in expected signal cross-section due to the
higher center-of-mass energy of collisions, to an upgraded detector with a new
silicon layer close to the interaction point, and to analysis improvements. No
significant deviation from Standard Model background expectations is observed,
and lifetime-dependent upper limits on $R$-hadron production cross-sections and
masses are set. Gluino $R$-hadrons with lifetimes above 0.4 ns and decaying to
$q\bar{q}$ plus a 100 GeV neutralino are excluded at the 95% confidence level,
with lower mass limit ranging between 740 GeV and 1590 GeV. In the case of
stable $R$-hadrons the lower mass limit at the 95% confidence level is 1570
GeV.

torsional waves are completely absorbed when they hit the equator if G = 1.3e8

crucial for a successful detection of the EoR signal. Here, we have calculated
the accuracy of the nominal model beam of LOFAR in predicting the leakage from
Stokes I to Q, U by comparing them with the corresponding leakage of compact
sources actually observed in the 3C295 field. We have found that the model beam
has errors of less than or equal to 10% on the predicted levels of leakage of
~1% within the field of view, i. e. if the leakage is taken out perfectly using
this model the leakage will reduce to $10^{-3}$ of the Stokes I flux. If
similar levels of accuracy can be obtained in removing leakage from Stokes Q, U
to I, we can say, based on the results of our previous paper, that the removal
of this leakage using this beam model would ensure that the leakage is well
below the expected EoR signal in almost the whole instrumental k-space of the

calibration can remove instrumentally polarized compact sources, given an
unpolarized sky model, very close to the local noise level.

more sharply peaked than expected for a spherically-symmetric blast wave, with

relative to modern-day data, is ""daisy-chaining"", whereby calibration is passed
from one data subset to the neighbouring one, usually using regressions of the
data subsets for the intervals of their overlap. Recent studies have
illustrated serious pitfalls in these regressions and the resulting errors can
be compounded by their repeated use as the data sequence is extended back in
time. Hence the recent composite data series by Usoskin et al. (2016),
$R_{UEA}$, is a very important advance because it avoids regressions,
daisy-chaining and other common, but invalid, assumptions: this is achieved by
comparing the statistics of ""active day"" fractions to those for a single
reference dataset. We study six sunspot data series including $R_{UEA}$ and the
new ""backbone"" data series $R_{BB}$, recently generated by Svalgaard and
Schatten (2016) by employing both regression and daisy-chaining. We show that
all six can be used with a continuity model to reproduce the main features of
the open solar flux variation for 1845-2014, as reconstructed from geomagnetic
activity data. However, some differences can be identified that are consistent
with tests using a basket of other proxies for solar magnetic fields. Using
data from a variety of sunspot observers, we illustrate problems with the
method employed in $R_{BB}$ which cause it to increasingly overestimate sunspot
numbers going back in time and we recommend using $R_{UEA}$ because it employs
more robust procedures that avoid such problems.

microscopy (cryo-EM) data represents a major challenge for high-resolution
structure determination. Unsupervised classification may serve as the first
step in the assessment of structural heterogeneity. Traditional algorithms for
unsupervised classification, such as K-means clustering and maximum likelihood
optimization, may classify images into wrong classes with decreasing
signal-to-noise-ratio (SNR) in the image data, yet demand increased cost in
computation. Overcoming these limitations requires further development on
clustering algorithms for high-performance cryo-EM data analysis. Results: Here
we introduce a statistical manifold learning algorithm for unsupervised
single-particle deep clustering. We show that statistical manifold learning
improves classification accuracy by about 40% in the absence of input
references for lower SNR data. Applications to several experimental datasets
suggest that our deep clustering approach can detect subtle structural
difference among classes. Through code optimization over the Intel
high-performance computing (HPC) processors, our software implementation can
generate thousands of reference-free class averages within several hours from
hundreds of thousands of single-particle cryo-EM images, which allows
significant improvement in ab initio 3D reconstruction resolution and quality.
Our approach has been successfully applied in several structural determination

a-posteriori multi-objective error estimates for finite-element approximations,
and for constructing corresponding (quasi-)optimal adaptive refinements of
finite-element spaces. As opposed to the classical goal-oriented approaches,
which consider only a single objective functional, the presented methodology
applies to general closed convex subsets of the dual space and constructs a
worst-case error estimate of the finite-element approximation error. This
worst-case multi-objective error estimate conforms to a dual-weighted residual,
in which the dual solution is associated with an approximate supporting
functional of the objective set at the approximation error. We regard both
standard approximation errors and data-incompatibility errors associated with
incompatibility of boundary data with the trace of the finite-element space.
Numerical experiments are presented to demonstrate the efficacy of applying the
proposed worst-case multi-objective error in adaptive refinement procedures.

detailed phase-space analysis is performed. A special emphasis is given to the
existence of stable orbits for a planet less than 15M$_\oplus$ which is
injected between the inner and outer planets. Thus, numerical simulations are
performed for three and four bodies in elliptical orbits (or circular for
special cases) by using a large number of initial conditions that cover the
selected phase-spaces of the planet's orbital parameters. The results presented
in the phase-space maps for GJ 832c indicate the least deviation of
eccentricity from its nominal value, which is then used to determine its
inclination regime relative to the star-outer planet plane. Also, the injected
planet displays stable orbital configurations for at least one billion years.
Then, the radial velocity curves based on the signature from the Keplerian
motion are generated for the injected planets with masses 1M$_\oplus$ to
15M$_\oplus$ in order to estimate their semimajor axes and mass-limit. The
synthetic RV signal suggests that an additional planet of mass $\le$

$^{12}$CO and $^{13}$CO emission maps for the $J=1\rightarrow0$ rotational
transition. The emission maps are analysed with commonly used observational
methods, i.e. the $^{13}$CO column density measurement, the virial mass
estimate and the so-called $X_{\textrm{CO}}$ (also CO-to-H$_2$) conversion
factor, and then the inferred quantities (i.e. mass and column density) are
compared to the physical values. We generally find that most methods examined
here recover the CO-emitting H$_{2}$ gas mass of MCs within a factor of two
uncertainty if the metallicity is not too low. The exception is the $^{13}$CO
column density method. It is affected by chemical and optical depth issues, and
it measures both the true H$_{2}$ column density distribution and the molecular
mass poorly. The virial mass estimate seems to work the best in the considered
metallicity and radiation field strength range, even when the overall virial
parameter of the cloud is above the equilibrium value. This is explained by a
systematically lower virial parameter (i.e. closer to equilibrium) in the
CO-emitting regions; in CO emission, clouds might seem (sub-)virial, even when,
in fact, they are expanding or being dispersed. A single CO-to-H$_{2}$
conversion factor appears to be a robust choice over relatively wide ranges of
cloud conditions, unless the metallicity is low. The methods which try to take
the metallicity dependence of the conversion factor into account tend to
systematically overestimate the true cloud masses.

proof in 2D that exact, highly oscillatory, Rayleigh wave solutions $u^\eps$ to
the nonlinear elasticity equations exist on a fixed time interval independent

provided by the analysis of the amplitude equation is indeed close in a precise

mainly on the case of Rayleigh waves that are \emph{pulses}, which have
profiles with continuous Fourier spectrum, but our method applies equally well

problem has studied the query complexity of preference elicitation for the

paper, we consider the domain of single crossing preference profiles and study
the query complexity of preference elicitation under various settings. We
consider two distinct situations: when an ordering of the voters with respect
to which the profile is single crossing is known versus when it is unknown. We
also consider different access models: when the votes can be accessed at
random, as opposed to when they are coming in a pre-defined sequence. In the
sequential access model, we distinguish two cases when the ordering is known:
the first is that sequence in which the votes appear is also a single-crossing
order, versus when it is not.
  The main contribution of our work is to provide polynomial time algorithms
with low query complexity for preference elicitation in all the above six
cases. Further, we show that the query complexities of our algorithms are
optimal up to constant factors for all but one of the above six cases. We then
present preference elicitation algorithms for profiles which are close to being

Voronoi Tessellation is a strongly proximal Edelsbrunner-Harer nerve, each MNC
nerve and the union of the sets in the MNC have the same homotopy type.

effective Fokker-Planck equations). However, no effective numerical method has
yet been developed to compute their solution. The purpose of this report is to
fill this gap, and provide a new perspective on the problem of numerical
approximation of nonlinear functionals and functional differential equations.

absence of any external confinement is investigated. By means of Quantum
Hydrodynamic Model in the electrostatic limit it is found that the equilibrium
density profile is a smooth continuous function which, in the linear regime,
supports multiple non-normal surface modes. Defining a spectrum function and
using a cutting condition, the dispersion relations of these modes and their
relevance for realistic dynamics are computed. It is found that the multiple
surface plasmons present a significant red-shift with respect to the case of
fully bounded quantum plasmas.

particle production mechanisms in heavy-ion collisions. The mixed-event
technique is generally used as a standard method to correct for
finite-acceptance effects. We demonstrate that event mixing only provides an
approximate acceptance correction, and propose new methods for
finite-acceptance corrections. Starting from discussions about 2-dimensional
correction procedures, new methods are derived for specific assumptions on the
properties of the signal, such as uniform signal distribution or
$\delta$-function-like trigger particle distribution, and suitable for
two-particle correlation analyses from particles at mid-rapidity and jet-hadron
or high $p_{\text{T}}$-triggered hadron-hadron correlations. Per-trigger
associated particle yields from the mixed-event method and the new methods are
compared through Monte Carlo simulations containing well-defined correlation
signals. Significant differences are observed at large pseudorapidity
differences in general and especially for asymmetric particle distribution like
that produced in proton--nucleus collisions. The applicability and validity of
the new methods are discussed in detail.

electromagnetic fields which induce potential wells having fixed spatial
distribution but deepening over time up to some limit. It is assumed that given
particles are under conditions of the high vacuum and forces acting on these
particles are not dissipative. We have established slowdown of comparatively
fast particles as a result of their transit through considered potential wells.
This process is demonstrated on example of the nonresonance laser beam with the
intensity amplifying over time. More detailed research of particle slowdown in
such electromagnetic fields is carried out on the basis of simple analytical
relationships obtained from basic equations of classical mechanics for the
model of the one-dimensional rectangular potential well deepening over time.
Method for cooling of particles, demonstrated in the present work, may be
applied for essential increase of spectroscopy resolution of various
microparticles, including in definite cases also atoms and molecules in the
ground quantum state.

ad hoc networks, maximizing the network lifetime is the first concern in the
related designing and maintaining activities. We study the network lifetime
from the perspective of network science. In our dynamic network, nodes are
assigned a fixed amount of energy initially and consume the energy in the
delivery of packets. We divided the network traffic flow into four states: no,
slow, fast, and absolute congestion states. We derive the network lifetime by
considering the state of the traffic flow. We find that the network lifetime is
generally opposite to traffic congestion in that the more congested traffic,
the less network lifetime. We also find the impacts of factors such as packet
generation rate, communication radius, node moving speed, etc., on network
lifetime and traffic congestion.
