macromolecules and colloidal particles in solution, with applications in, e.g.,
DNA translocation through nanopores, electro-osmotic flow in nanocapillaries,
and electrophoresis of charged macromolecules. Numerical simulations are an
important tool to investigate these electrokinetic phenomena, but are often
plagued by spurious fluxes and spurious flows that can easily exceed physical
fluxes and flows. Here, we present a method that reduces one of these spurious
currents, spurious flow, by several orders of magnitude. We demonstrate the
effectiveness and generality of our method for both electrokinetic
lattice-Boltzmann and finite-element-method based algorithms by simulating a
charged sphere in an electrolyte solution, and flow through a nanopore. We also
show that previous attempts to suppress these spurious currents introduce other
sources of error.

interpreting various disk observations and for quantifying the subsequent

lines is a powerful tool to assess the temperature gradient in the warm
molecular layer of disks. Spectrally resolved high-$J$ ($J_{\rm u} > 14$) CO

Tauri (AS 205, S CrA, TW Hya) disks. In the case of the T Tauri systems AS 205
and S CrA, the CO emission has a single-peaked profile, likely due to a slow
wind. For all other systems, the {\it Herschel} CO spectra are consistent with
pure disk emission and the spectrally-resolved lines (HIFI) and the CO
rotational ladder (PACS) are analyzed simultaneously assuming power-law
temperature and column density profiles, using the velocity profile to locate
the emission in the disk. The temperature profile varies substantially from
disk to disk. In particular, $T_{\rm gas}$ in the disk surface layers can
differ by up to an order of magnitude among the 4 Herbig AeBe systems with HD
100546 being the hottest and HD 163296 the coldest disk of the sample. Clear
evidence of a warm disk layer where $T_{\rm gas} > T_{\rm dust}$ is found in
all the Herbig Ae disks. The observed CO fluxes and line profiles are compared
to predictions of physical-chemical models. The primary parameters affecting
the disk temperature structure are the flaring angle, the gas-to-dust mass
ratio the scale height and the dust settling.

tidal disruption flares in the last five years, and future surveys like the

more. These tidal disruption events (TDEs) present an interesting puzzle: a
majority of the current TDE sample is hosted by rare post-starburst galaxies,
and tens of percent are hosted in even rarer E+A galaxies, which make up $\sim
0.1\%$ of all galaxies in the local universe. E+As are therefore
overrepresented among TDE hosts by 1-2 orders of magnitude, a discrepancy
unlikely to be accounted for by selection effects. We analyze {\it Hubble Space

the rate of stellar tidal disruption produced as two-body relaxation diffuses
stars onto orbits in the loss cone of the central supermassive black hole. The
rate of TDEs produced by two-body relaxation in NGC~3156 is large when compared
to other galaxies with similar black hole mass: $\dot{N}_{\rm TDE}\sim 1\times
10^{-3}~{\rm yr}^{-1}$. This suggests that the preference of TDEs for E+A hosts
may be due to central stellar overdensities produced in recent starbursts.

allow detailed investigations of the internal structure and evolution of stars
undergoing time-variable tidal interactions. Previous studies have led to the
conclusion that the internal structure of Spica's primary star may be more
centrally condensed than predicted by theoretical models of single stars,
raising the possibility that the interactions could lead to effects that are
currently neglected in structure and evolution calculations. The key parameters
in confirming this result are the values of the orbital eccentricity $e$, the
apsidal period $U$, and the primary star's radius, R_1. We analyze the impact
that line profile variability has on the derivation of its orbital elements and
R_1. We use high SNR observations obtained in 2000, 2008, and 2013 to derive
the orbital elements from fits to the radial velocity curves. We produce
synthetic line profiles using an ab initio tidal interaction model. Results:
The variations in the line profiles can be understood in terms of the tidal
flows, whose large-scale structure is relatively fixed in the rotating binary
system reference frame. Fits to the radial velocity curves yield
$e$=0.108$\pm$0.014. However, the analogous RV curves from theoretical line
profiles indicate that the distortion in the lines causes the fitted value of
$e$ to depend on the argument of periastron; i.e., on the epoch of observation.
As a result, the actual value of $e$ may be as high as 0.125. We find that
$U$=117.9$\pm$1.8, which is in agreement with previous determinations. Using
the value $R_1=6.8 R_\odot$ derived by Palate et al. (2013) the value of the
observational internal structure constant $k_{2,obs}$ is consistent with
theory. We confirm the presence of variability in the line profiles of the
secondary star.

revealing topological invariants as the Chern number. At the heart of
topological materials are topologically protected edge states that occur at the
intersection between regions of different topological order. Ultracold atomic
gases in optical lattices are promising new platforms for topological states of
matter, though the observation of edge states has so far been restricted in
these systems to the state space imposed by the internal atomic structure. Here
we report on the observation of an edge state between two topological distinct
phases of an atomic physics system in real space using optical microscopy. An
interface between two spatial regions of different topological order is
realized in a one-dimensional optical lattice of spatially chirped amplitude.
To reach this, a magnetic field gradient causes a spatial variation of the
Raman detuning in an atomic rubidium three- level system and a corresponding
spatial variation of the coupling between momentum eigenstates. This novel
experimental technique realizes a cold atom system described by a Dirac
equation with an inhomogeneous mass term closely related to the SSH-model. The
observed edge state is characterized by measuring the overlap to various
initial states, revealing that this topological state has singlet nature in
contrast to the other system eigenstates, which occur pairwise. We also
determine the size of the energy gap to the adjacent eigenstate doublet. Our
findings hold prospects for the spectroscopy of surface states in topological
matter and for the quantum simulation of interacting Dirac systems.

redshift ($z > 2$). The origin of their Lyman-$\alpha$ (Lya) emission remains
debated. Recent polarimetric observations showed that at least some Lya sources
are polarized. This is often interpreted as a proof that the photons are
centrally produced, and opposed to the scenario in which the Lya emission is
the cooling radiation emitted by gas heated during the accretion onto the halo.
We suggest that this scenario is not incompatible with the polarimetric
observations. In order to test this idea, we post-process a radiative
hydrodynamics simulation of a blob with the MCLya Monte Carlo transfer code. We
compute radial profiles for the surface brightness and the degree of
polarization and compare them to existing observations. We find that both are
consistent with a significant contribution of the extragalactic gas to the Lya
emission. Most of the photons are centrally emitted and scattered inside the
filament afterwards, producing the observed high level of polarization. We
argue that the contribution of the extragalactic gas to the Lya emission does
not prevent polarization to arise. On the contrary, we find that pure galactic
emission causes the polarization profile to be too steep to be consistent with
observations.

NT particles accelerated in the jet shock, focusing on electrons or
$e^\pm$-pairs. Several cases are explored, considering different jet-star
interaction locations, magnetic fields and observer lines of sight. The jet
luminosity and star properties are fixed, but the results are easily scalable
under changes of these parameters. Individual jet-star interactions produce
synchrotron and inverse Compton (IC) emission that peaks from X-rays to MeV
energies (depending on the magnetic field), and at $\sim 100-1000$ GeV
(depending on the stellar type), respectively. The radiation spectrum is hard
in the scenarios explored here due to non-radiative cooling dominance, as
low-energy electrons are efficiently advected even under relatively high
magnetic fields. Interactions of jets with cold stars lead to an even harder IC
spectrum because of the Klein-Nishina effect in the cross-section. Doppler
boosting has a strong impact on the observer luminosity. The emission levels
for individual interactions found here are in the line of previous, more

performed a detailed investigation of the influence of water uptake on the
translational and reorientational glassy dynamics in the typical ionic liquid
1-Butyl-3-methyl-imidazolium chloride. From a careful analysis of the measured
dielectric permittivity and conductivity spectra, we find a significant
acceleration of cation reorientation and a marked increase of the ionic
conductivity for higher water contents. The latter effect mainly arises due to
a strong impact of water content on the glass temperature, which for the
well-dried material is found to be larger than any values reported in
literature for this system. The fragility, characterizing the non-Arrhenius
glassy dynamics of the ionic subsystem, also changes with varying water
content. Decoupling of the ionic motion from the structural dynamics has to be
considered to explain the results.

center. Together with its distance, this makes it one of the most central
globular clusters in the Milky Way. It has a blue horizontal branch (BHB) and a
metallicity of [Fe/H]~-1.0. This means that it probably is one of the oldest
objects in the Galaxy. Abundance ratios can reveal the nucleosynthesis pattern
of the first stars as well as the early chemical enrichment and early formation
of stellar populations. High-resolution spectra obtained for six stars were
analyzed to derive the abundances of the light elements C, N, O, Na, and Al,
the alpha-elements Mg, Si, Ca, and Ti, and the heavy elements Sr, Y , Zr, Ba,
La, and Eu.} High-resolution spectra of six red giants that are confirmed
members of the bulge globular cluster HP~1 were obtained with the 8m VLT
UT2-Kueyen telescope with the UVES spectrograph in FLAMES-UVES configuration.
The spectroscopic parameter derivation was based on the excitation and
ionization equilibrium of FeI and FeII. We confirm a mean metallicity of [Fe/H]
= -1.06~0.10, by adding the two stars that were previously analyzed in HP~1.
The alpha-elements O and Mg are enhanced by about +0.3<[O,Mg/Fe]<+0.5 dex, Si
is moderately enhanced with +0.15<[Si/Fe]<+0.35dex, while Ca and Ti show lower
values of -0.04<[Ca,Ti/Fe]<+0.28dex. The r-element Eu is also enhanced with
[Eu/Fe]~+0.4, which together with O and Mg is indicative of early enrichment by
type II supernovae. Na and Al are low, but it is unclear if Na-O are
anticorrelated. The heavy elements are moderately enhanced, with
-0.20<[La/Fe]<+0.43dex and 0.0<[Ba/Fe]<+0.75~dex, which is compatible with
r-process formation. The spread in Y, Zr, Ba, and La abundances, on the other
hand, appears to be compatible with the spinstar scenario or other additional
mechanisms such as the weak r-process.

the dynamics of beneficial biological and social epidemics differ from those of
detrimental epidemics? We investigate this question using three theoretical
approaches. First, in the context of population genetics, we show that a
horizontally-transmissible element that increases fitness, such as viral DNA,
spreads superexponentially through a population, more quickly than a beneficial
mutation. Second, in the context of behavioral epidemiology, we show that
infections that cause increased connectivity lead to superexponential fixation
in the population. Third, in the context of dynamic social networks, we find
that preferences for increased global infection accelerate spread and produce
superexponential fixation, but preferences for local assortativity halt
epidemics by disconnecting the infected from the susceptible. We conclude that
the dynamics of beneficial biological and social epidemics are characterized by
the rapid spread of beneficial elements, which is facilitated in biological
systems by horizontal transmission and in social systems by active spreading
behavior of infected individuals.

Knowledge about these relationships can provide important insights into cancer
drivers, cancer-driving pathways, and cancer subtypes. It can also be used to
predict new functional interactions between cancer driving genes and uncover
novel cancer drivers. Currently, most of mutual exclusivity analyses are
preformed focusing on a limited set of genes in part due to the computational
cost required to rigorously compute p-values. To reduce the computing cost and
perform less restricted mutual exclusivity analysis, we developed an efficient
method to estimate p-values while controlling the mutation rates of individual
patients and genes similar to the permutation test. A comprehensive mutual
exclusivity analysis allowed us to uncover mutually exclusive pairs, some of
which may have relatively low mutation rates. These pairs often included likely
cancer drivers that have been missed in previous analyses. More importantly,
our results demonstrated that mutual exclusivity can also provide information
that goes beyond the interactions between cancer drivers and can, for example,
elucidate different mutagenic processes in different cancer groups. In
particular, including frequently mutated, long genes such as TTN in our
analysis allowed us to observe interesting patterns of APOBEC activity in
breast cancer and identify a set of related driver genes that are highly
predictive of patient survival. In addition, we utilized our mutual exclusivity
analysis in support of a previously proposed model where APOBEC activity is the
underlying process that causes TP53 mutations in a subset of breast cancer
cases.

framework for the cooperative planning of renewable generations in a system of

self-interested behaviors of microgrids, and incorporates both their long-term
investment costs and short-term operational costs over the planning horizon.
Specifically, interconnected microgrids jointly decide where and how much to
deploy renewable energy generations, and how to split the associated investment
cost. We show that the cooperative framework minimizes the overall system cost.
We also design a fair cost sharing method based on Nash bargaining to
incentivize cooperative planning, such that all microgrids will benefit from
cooperative planning. Using realistic data obtained from the Hong Kong
observatory, we validate the cooperative planning framework, and demonstrate
that all microgrids benefit through the cooperation, and the overall system
cost is reduced by 35.9% compared to the noncooperative planning benchmark.

from anthropogenic emissions and Earth System feedbacks that reduce or amplify
the effects of those emissions on atmospheric concentrations. Despite decades
of research carbon-climate feedbacks remain poorly quantified. The impact of
these uncertainties on future climate are of increasing concern, especially in
the wake of recent climate negotiations. Emissions, long concentrated in the
developed world, are now shifting to developing countries, where the emissions
inventories have larger uncertainties. The fraction of anthropogenic CO2
remaining in the atmosphere has remained remarkably constant over the last 50
years. Will this change in the future as the climate evolves? Concentrations of
CH4, the 2nd most important greenhouse gas, which had apparently stabilized,
have recently resumed their increase, but the exact cause for this is unknown.
While greenhouse gases affect the global atmosphere, their sources and sinks
are remarkably heterogeneous in time and space, and traditional in situ
observing systems do not provide the coverage and resolution to attribute the
changes to these greenhouse gases to specific sources or sinks. In the past few
years, space-based technologies have shown promise for monitoring carbon stocks
and fluxes. Advanced versions of these capabilities could transform our
understanding and provide the data needed to quantify carbon-climate feedbacks.
A new observing system that allows resolving global high resolution fluxes will
capture variations on time and space scales that allow the attribution of these
fluxes to underlying mechanisms.

type II Weyl semimetal. Distinguished from type I semimetal (e.g. TaAs), the
Fermi surfaces in a type II Weyl semimetal consist of a pair of electron and
hole pockets touching at the Weyl node. In addition, Weyl fermions in type II
Weyl semimetals violate Lorentz invariance. Due to these qualitative
differences distinct spectroscopy and magnetotransport properties are expected
in type II Weyl semimetals. Here, we present the direct observation of the
Fermi arc states in MoTe2 by using angle resolved photoemission spectroscopy.
Two arc states are identified for each pair of Weyl nodes whoes surface
projections of them possess single topological charge, which is a unique
property for type II Weyl semimetals. The experimentally determined Fermi arcs
are consistent with our first principle calculations. Our results unambiguously
establish that MoTe2 is a type II Weyl semimetal, which serves as a great test
bed to investigate the phenomena of new type of Weyl fermions with Lorentz
invariance violated.

the space-inversion ($\mathcal{I}$) or time-reversal ($\mathcal{T}$) symmetry.
They can either respect Lorentz symmetry (type-I) or strongly violate it

occur only in different classes of materials. In this paper, we present a
significant materials breakthrough by identifying a large class of Weyl

$\mathcal{T}$-breaking, type-I or type-II), depending on a suitable choice of

the Weyl fermions can be tuned. The unparalleled tunability and the large
number of compounds make the RAlX family of compounds a unique Weyl semimetal

address these challenges, we test three modifications to the standard Fast
R-CNN object detector: (1) skip connections that give the detector access to
features at multiple network layers, (2) a foveal structure to exploit object
context at multiple object resolutions, and (3) an integral loss function and
corresponding network adjustment that improve localization. The result of these
modifications is that information can flow along multiple paths in our network,
including through features from multiple network layers and from multiple
object views. We refer to our modified classifier as a ""MultiPath"" network. We
couple our MultiPath network with DeepMask object proposals, which are well
suited for localization and small objects, and adapt our pipeline to predict
segmentation masks in addition to bounding boxes. The combined system improves
results over the baseline Fast R-CNN detector with Selective Search by 66%
overall and by 4x on small objects. It placed second in both the COCO 2015
detection and segmentation challenges.

extent to which an online policy succeeds in learning feasible actions while
regret measures its success in learning optimal actions. This paper proposes
the use of online policies computed from a saddle point controller which are
shown to have fit and regret that are either bounded or grow at a sublinear

low, ranging from [M/H]=-3 to -1.68, with even lower metallicities likely for

replenish their gas from the low-metallicity intergalactic medium (IGM) via
high-density H I ""flows"" and eject enriched interstellar gas via outflows.
Thus, there has been some expectation that LLSs at the peak of cosmic star
formation ($z\approx3$) might have a bimodal metallicity distribution. We
modeled our CDF as a mix of two Gaussian distributions, one reflecting the
metallicity of the IGM and the other representative of the interstellar medium
of star-forming galaxies. This bimodal distribution yielded a poor fit. A
single Gaussian distribution better represented the sample with a low mean
metallicity of [M/H] $\approx -2.5$.

detect a white dwarf or M-dwarf perturber at signal to noise ratio of 8, if it

were employed to classify the galaxies in these systems as star-forming, active

  Our results suggest that the brightest galaxies drive the triplet evolution,
as evidenced by the strong correlations between properties as mass assembly and
mean stellar population age with triplet properties. Galaxies with intermediate
luminosity or the faintest one within the triplet seem to play a secondary
role. Moreover, the relation between age and stellar mass of galaxies is
similar for these galaxies but different for the brightest galaxy in the
system. Most of the triplet galaxies are passive or retired, according to the
WHAN classification. Low mass triplets present different fractions of WHAN
classes when compared to higher mass triplets. A census of WHAN class
combinations shows the dominance of star-forming galaxies in low mass triplets
while retired and passive galaxies prevail in high-mass systems. We argue that
these results suggest that the local environment, through galaxy interactions
driven by the brightest galaxy, is playing a major role in triplet evolution.

gravitino mass. We perform an accurate calculation of the Yukawa coupling
constants of $b$ and $\tau$ at the grand unified theory (GUT) scale, including
relevant renormalization group effects and threshold corrections. In
particular, we study the renormalization group effects, taking into account the
mass splittings among sfermions, gauginos, and the standard model particles. We
found that the Yukawa coupling constant of $b$ at the GUT scale is about $70\
\%$ of that of $\tau$ if there is no hierarchy between the sfermion masses and
the gravitino mass. Our results suggest sizable threshold corrections to the
Yukawa coupling constants at the GUT scale or significant suppressions of the
sfermion masses relative to the gravitino mass.

families of sets, subject to various intersection requirements on the sets in
the family. Stability versions of such theorems assert that if the size of a
family is close to the maximum possible size, then the family itself must be
close (in some appropriate sense) to a maximum-sized family.
  In this paper, we present an approach to obtaining stability versions of
EKR-type theorems, via isoperimetric inequalities for subsets of the hypercube.
Our approach is rather general, and allows the leveraging of a wide variety of
exact EKR-type results into strong stability versions of these results, without
going into the proofs of the original results.
  We use this approach to obtain tight stability versions of the EKR theorem
itself and of the Ahlswede-Khachatrian theorem on $t$-intersecting families of
$k$-element subsets of $\{1,2,\ldots.n\}$ (for $k < \frac{n}{t+1}$), and to
show that, somewhat surprisingly, all these results hold when the intersection
requirement is replaced by a much weaker requirement.
  Other examples include stability versions of Frankl's recent result on the
Erd\H{o}s matching conjecture, the Ellis-Filmus-Friedgut proof of the
Simonovits-S\'{o}s conjecture, and various EKR-type results on $r$-wise

dwarfs in cataclysmic variables. These stars offer insight into the excitation
of pulsation modes in atmospheres with mixed compositions of hydrogen, helium,
and metals, and the response of these modes to changes in the white dwarf
temperature. Among all pulsating cataclysmic variable white dwarfs, GW Librae
stands out by having a well-established observational record of three
independent pulsation modes that disappeared when the white dwarf temperature
rose dramatically following its 2007 accretion outburst. Our analysis of HST
ultraviolet spectroscopy taken in 2002, 2010 and 2011, showed that pulsations
produce variations in the white dwarf effective temperature as predicted by
theory. Additionally in May~2013, we obtained new HST/COS ultraviolet
observations that displayed unexpected behaviour: besides showing variability
at ~275s, which is close to the post-outburst pulsations detected with HST in
2010 and 2011, the white dwarf exhibits high-amplitude variability on a ~4.4h
time-scale. We demonstrate that this variability is produced by an increase of
the temperature of a region on white dwarf covering up to ~30 per cent of the
visible white dwarf surface. We argue against a short-lived accretion episode
as the explanation of such heating, and discuss this event in the context of
non-radial pulsations on a rapidly rotating star

hierarchical mass accretion over cosmological scales. How the mass is
concentrated is predicted to correlate with the total mass in the cluster's
halo, with systems at higher mass being less concentrated at given redshift and
for any given mass, systems with lower concentration are found at higher
redshifts. Through a spatial and spectral X-ray analysis, we reconstruct the
total mass profile of 47 galaxy clusters observed with Chandra in the redshift
range $0.4<z<1.2$, selected to have no major mergers, to investigate the
relation between the mass and the dark matter concentration, and the evolution
of this relation with redshift. The sample in exam is the largest one
investigated so far at $z>0.4$, and is well suited to provide the first
constraint on the concentration--mass relation at $z>0.7$ from X-ray analysis.
Under the assumptions that the distribution of the X-ray emitting gas is
spherically symmetric and in hydrostatic equilibrium, we combine the
deprojected gas density and spectral temperature profiles through the
hydrostatic equilibrium equation to recover the parameters that describe a NFW
total mass distribution. The comparison with results from weak lensing analysis
reveals a very good agreement both for masses and concentrations. Uncertainties
are however too large to make any robust conclusion on the hydrostatic bias of
these systems. The relation is well described by the form $c \propto M^B
(1+z)^C$, with $B=-0.50 \pm 0.20$, $C=0.12 \pm 0.61$ (at 68.3\% confidence), it
is slightly steeper than the one predicted by numerical simulations
($B\sim-0.1$) and does not show any evident redshift evolution. We obtain the
first constraints on the properties of the concentration--mass relation at $z >
0.7$ from X-ray data, showing a reasonable good agreement with recent numerical
predictions.

(~10^4 K) circumgalactic medium (CGM) from measurements of ionic column
densities, by assuming that the cool CGM spans a large range of gas densities
and that small high-density clouds are hierarchically embedded in large
low-density clouds. The new method combines the information available from
different sightlines during the photoionization modeling, thus yielding tighter
constraints on CGM properties compared to traditional methods which model each
sightline individually. Applying this new technique to the COS-Halos survey of
low-redshift ~L* galaxies, we find that we can reproduce all observed ion
columns in all 44 galaxies in the sample, from the low-ions to OVI, with a
single universal density structure for the cool CGM. The gas densities span the
range 50 < \rho/\rho_mean < 5x10^5 (\rho_mean is the cosmic mean), while the
physical size of individual clouds scales as ~\rho^-1, from ~35 kpc of the low
density OVI clouds to ~6 pc of the highest density low-ion clouds. The deduced
cloud sizes are too small for this density structure to be driven by
self-gravity, thus its physical origin is unclear. The implied cool CGM mass
within the virial radius is 1.3x10^10 M_sun (~1% of the halo mass), distributed
rather uniformly over the four decades in density. The mean cool gas density
profile scales as R^-1.0, where R is the distance from the galaxy center. We
construct a 3D model of the cool CGM based on our results, which we argue
provides a benchmark for the CGM structure in hydrodynamic simulations. Our
results can be tested by measuring the coherence scales of different ions.

deduce from these results a fractional persistence theorem which ensures that
positivity, order preserving, equilibrium points and stability is preserved
under a Caputo fractional embedding of a given differential equation. At the
discrete level, the problem is more complicated. Following a strategy initiated
by R. Mickens dealing with non local approximations, we define a non standard

certain I/O devices explicit. We evaluate our defense mechanisms through
laboratory-based experimentation and a user study, involving 74 human subjects,
whose ability to identify undesired operations targeting I/O devices increased
significantly. Without Aware, only 18% of the participants were able to
identify attacks from tested RAT apps. Aware systematically blocks all the
attacks in absence of user consent and supports users in identifying 82% of
social-engineering attacks tested to hijack approved requests, including some
more sophisticated forms of social engineering not yet present in available

companion, is expected to be oblate due to its rapid rotational velocity
($v\sin i$ = $\sim$162 $\mathrm{km~s^{-1}}$). We observed the star with the
CHARA Array's optical beam combiner, PAVO, measuring its size at multiple
orientations and determining its oblateness. The interferometric measurements,
combined with photometry and this $v\sin i$ value are used to constrain an
oblate star model that yields the fundamental properties of the star and finds
a rotation speed that is $\sim$85\% of the critical rate and a low inclination
of $\sim$30$^\circ$. Three modeled properties (the average radius, bolometric
luminosity, and equatorial velocity) are compared to MESA evolution models to
determine an age and mass for the star. In doing so, we determine an age for
the system of 47$^{+27}_{-40}$ Myr. Based on this age and previous measurements
of the companion's temperature, the BHAC15 evolution models imply a mass for
the companion of 22$^{+8}_{-9}$ M$_\mathrm{J}$.

topology of the Universe is the circles-in-the-sky in the CMB sky. In the most
general search, pairs of circles with deviation from antipodality $0^\circ \leq
\theta \leq 169^\circ$ and radii $10^\circ \leq \lambda \leq 90^\circ$ were
investigated, but no matching circles were found. Assuming this negative
result, we examine the question as to whether there are nearly flat universes
with compact topology that would give rise to circles whose observable
parameters $\lambda$ and $\theta$ fall o outside the ranges covered by this
search. We derive the expressions for the deviation from antipodality and for
the radius of the circles associated to a pair elements
($\gamma\,$,$\gamma^{-1}$) of the holonomy group $\Gamma$ which define the
spatial section of any positively curved universe with a nontrivial topology.
We show that there is a critical position that maximizes the deviation from
antipodality, and prove that no matter how nearly flat the Universe is, it can
always have a nontrivial spatial topology that gives rise to circles whose
deviation from antipodality $\theta$ is larger than $169^\circ$, and whose
radii of the circles $\lambda$ are smaller than $10^\circ$ for some observers.
This makes apparent that slightly positively curved universes with cosmological
parameters within Planck bounds can be endowed with a nontrivial spatial
topology with values of the parameters $\lambda$ and $\theta$ outside the
ranges covered by the searches for circles carried out so far. Thus, these
circles searches so far undertaken are not sufficient to exclude the
possibility of a universe with a detectable nontrivial cosmic topology. We
present concrete examples of such nearly flat universes, and discuss the
implications of our results in view of unavoidable practical limits of the
circles-in-the-sky method.

and embedded in a flexible and rapid manner. For example, SDN can be used to
flexibly steer traffic from a source to a destination through a sequence of
virtualized middleboxes, in order to realize so-called service chains. The
service chain embedding problem consists of three tasks: admission control,
finding suitable locations to allocate the virtualized middleboxes and
computing corresponding routing paths. This paper considers the offline batch
embedding of multiple service chains. Concretely, we consider the objectives of
maximizing the profit by embedding an optimal subset of requests or minimizing
the costs when all requests need to be embedded. Interestingly, while the
service chain embedding problem has recently received much attention, so far,
only non- polynomial time algorithms (based on integer programming) as well as
heuristics (which do not provide any formal guarantees) are known. This paper
presents the first polynomial time service chain approximation algorithms both
for the case with admission and without admission control. Our algorithm is
based on a novel extension of the classic linear programming and randomized
rounding technique, which may be of independent interest. In particular, we
show that our approach can also be extended to more complex service graphs,
containing cycles or sub-chains, hence also providing new insights into the
classic virtual network embedding problem.

study the Simultaneous Nearest Neighbor Search (SNN) problem. Given a set of
data points, the goal of SNN is to design a data structure that, given a
collection of queries, finds a collection of close points that are compatible
with each other. Formally, we are given $k$ query points $Q=q_1,\cdots,q_k$,
and a compatibility graph $G$ with vertices in $Q$, and the goal is to return
data points $p_1,\cdots,p_k$ that minimize (i) the weighted sum of the
distances from $q_i$ to $p_i$ and (ii) the weighted sum, over all edges $(i,j)$
in the compatibility graph $G$, of the distances between $p_i$ and $p_j$. The
problem has several applications, where one wants to return a set of consistent
answers to multiple related queries. This generalizes well-studied
computational problems, including NN, Aggregate NN and the 0-extension problem.
  In this paper we propose and analyze the following general two-step method
for designing efficient data structures for SNN. In the first step, for each
query point $q_i$ we find its (approximate) nearest neighbor point $\hat{p}_i$;
this can be done efficiently using existing approximate nearest neighbor
structures. In the second step, we solve an off-line optimization problem over
sets $q_1,\cdots,q_k$ and $\hat{p}_1,\cdots,\hat{p}_k$; this can be done
efficiently given that $k$ is much smaller than $n$. Even though
$\hat{p}_1,\cdots,\hat{p}_k$ might not constitute the optimal answers to
queries $q_1,\cdots,q_k$, we show that, for the unweighted case, the resulting
algorithm is $O(\log k/\log \log k)$-approximation. Also, we show that the
approximation factor can be in fact reduced to a constant for compatibility
graphs frequently occurring in practice.
  Finally, we show that the ""empirical approximation factor"" provided by the
above approach is very close to 1.

it takes for a bipartite measure of entanglement to obey a general quantitative
monogamy relation on all quantum states. We then prove that an important class
of entanglement measures fail to be monogamous in this general sense of the
term, with monogamy violations becoming generic with increasing dimension. In
particular, we show that every additive and suitably normalized entanglement
measure cannot satisfy any nontrivial general monogamy relation while at the
same time faithfully capturing the geometric entanglement structure of the
fully antisymmetric state in arbitrary dimension. Nevertheless, monogamy of
such entanglement measures can be recovered if one allows for
dimension-dependent relations, as we show explicitly with relevant examples.

evolutionary channels, including smooth accretion, disk instabilities, minor
and major mergers. We find that the combination of our recipe with hierarchical
clustering produces two distinct populations of bulges: merger-driven bulges,
akin to classical bulges and ellipticals, and instability-driven bulges, akin
to secular (or pseudo-)bulges. The model mostly reproduces the mass-size
relation of gaseous and stellar disks, the evolution of the mass-size relation
of ellipticals, the Faber-Jackson relation, and the magnitude-colour diagram of
classical and secular bulges. The model predicts only a small overlap of
merger-driven and instability-driven components in the same galaxy, and
predicts different bulge types as a function of galaxy mass and disk fraction.
Bulge type also affects the star formation rate and colour at a given
luminosity. The model predicts a population of merger-driven red ellipticals
that dominate both the low-mass and high-mass ends of the galaxy population,
and span all dynamical ages; merger-driven bulges in disk galaxies are
dynamically old and do not interfere with subsequent evolution of the
star-forming component. Instability-driven bulges dominate the population at
intermediate galaxy masses, especially thriving in massive disks. The model
green valley is exclusively populated by instability-driven bulge hosts.
Through the present implementation the mass accretion history is perceivable in

concentrations in serum is a fundamental problem in immunoinformatics.
Repertoire construction is a preliminary step of analysis of clonal lineages,
understanding of immune response dynamics, population analysis of
immunoglobulin and TCR loci. Emergence of MiSeq Illumina sequencing machine in
2013 opened horizons of investigation of adaptive immune repertoires using
highly accurate reads. Reads produced by MiSeq are able to cover repertoires of
moderate size. At the same time, throughput of sequencing machines increases
from year to year. This will enable ultra deep scanning of adaptive immune
repertoires and analysis of their diversity. Such data requires both efficient
and highly accurate repertoire construction tools. In 2015 Safonova et al.
presented IgRepertoireConstructor, a tool for accurate construction of antibody
repertoire and immunoproteogenomics analysis. Unfortunately, proposed algorithm
was very time and memory consuming and could be a bottleneck of processing
large immunosequencing libraries. In this paper we overcome this challenge and
present IgReC, a novel algorithm for adaptive repertoire construction problem.
IgReC reconstructs a repertoire with high precision even if each input read
contains sequencing errors and performs well on contemporary datasets. Results
of computational experiments show that IgReC improves state-of-the-art in the
field. Availability: IgReC is an open source and freely available program
running on Linux platforms. The source code is available at GitHub:

indicators for the prediction of such rare extreme events which do not require

functionals defined in terms of Optimally Time Dependent (OTD) modes. One such
functional has the form of the largest eigenvalue of the symmetric part of the
linearized dynamics reduced to these modes. In contrast to other choices of
subspaces, the proposed modes are flow invariant and therefore a projection
onto them is dynamically meaningful. We illustrate the application of these
indicators on three examples: a prototype low-dimensional model, a body forced
turbulent fluid flow, and a unidirectional model of nonlinear water waves. We
use Bayesian statistics to quantify the predictive power of the proposed
indicators.

  Distance","Accepted by Mathematic of Operations Research",,,,"math.OC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Distributionally robust stochastic optimization (DRSO) is an approach to
optimization under uncertainty in which, instead of assuming that there is a
known true underlying probability distribution, one hedges against a chosen set
of distributions. In this paper we first point out that the set of
distributions should be chosen to be appropriate for the application at hand,
and that some of the choices that have been popular until recently are, for
many applications, not good choices. We next consider sets of distributions
that are within a chosen Wasserstein distance from a nominal distribution. Such
a choice of sets has two advantages: (1) The resulting distributions hedged
against are more reasonable than those resulting from other popular choices of
sets. (2) The problem of determining the worst-case expectation over the
resulting set of distributions has desirable tractability properties. We derive
a strong duality reformulation of the corresponding DRSO problem and construct
approximate worst-case distributions explicitly via the first-order optimality
conditions of the dual problem.
  Our contributions are four-fold. (i) We identify necessary and sufficient
conditions for the existence of a worst-case distribution, which are naturally
related to the growth rate of the objective function. (ii) We show that the
worst-case distributions resulting from an appropriate Wasserstein distance
have a concise structure and a clear interpretation. (iii) Using this
structure, we show that data-driven DRSO problems can be approximated to any
accuracy by robust optimization problems, and thereby many DRSO problems become
tractable by using tools from robust optimization. (iv) Our strong duality
result holds in a very general setting. As examples, we show that it can be
applied to infinite-dimensional process control and intensity estimation for
point processes.

sources but are reproduced well by variations upon a common unified model where
the outflow viewing angle is the most significant difference between the

the high-mass star-forming regions such as infall, turbulence, and mass are
consistent with scaled-up versions of the low-mass case with turbulent
velocities that are supersonic and an order of magnitude larger than those
found in low-mass star-forming regions. Using detailed radiative transfer
modeling, we show that the G333 cores are essentially undergoing a scaled-up
version of low mass star formation. This is an extension of earlier work in
that the degree of infall and the chemical abundances are constrained by the RT
modeling in a way that is not practical with a standard analysis of
observational data. We also find high velocity infall and high infall mass
rates, possibly suggesting accelerated collapse due to external pressure.
Molecular depletion due to freeze-out onto dust grains in central regions of
the cores is suggested by low molecular abundances of several species. Strong
evidence for a local enhancement of 13C-bearing species towards the outflow

A large network, that is provided, is constructed and then reduced with the aim
of recovering a minimal regulatory core incorporating the necessary and

epithelial, senescent, and mesenchymal stem-like cells. Interestingly,
epigenetic landscape analyses of the uncovered network shows that it also
recovers the generic time-ordered transitions documented during tumorigenic

and/or antimagnetic rotations seen in near-spherical nuclei have attracted a
lot of attention. Unlike conventional rotation in well-deformed or
superdeformed nuclei, here the rotational axis is not necessary coinciding with
any principal axis of the nuclear density distribution. Thus, tilted axis
cranking is mandatory to describe these excitations self-consistently in the
framework of covariant density functional theory (CDFT). We will briefly
introduce the formalism of tilted axis cranking CDFT and its application for
magnetic and antimagnetic rotation phenomena. Configuration-fixed CDFT and its
predictions for nuclear chiral configurations and for favorable triaxial
deformation parameters are also presented, and the discoveries of the multiple
chiral doublets (M\c{hi}D) in 133Ce and 103Rh are discussed.

this issue, we have obtained follow-up optical spectroscopy of 9 z~7 galaxies
from a parent sample of 24 z~7 galaxy candidates selected from the 1.65 sq.deg
COSMOS-UltraVISTA and SXDS-UDS survey fields using the latest near-infrared
public survey data, and new ultra-deep Subaru z'-band imaging (which we also
present and describe in this paper). Our spectroscopy has yielded only one
possible detection of Lya at z=7.168 with a rest-frame equivalent width EW_0 =
3.7 (+1.7/-1.1) Angstrom. The relative weakness of this line, combined with our
failure to detect Lya emission from the other spectroscopic targets allows us
to place a new upper limit on the prevalence of strong Lya emission at these
redshifts. For conservative calculation and to facilitate comparison with
previous studies at lower redshifts, we derive a 1-sigma upper limit on the
fraction of UV bright galaxies at z~7 that display EW_0 > 50 Angstrom, which we
estimate to be < 0.23. This result may indicate a weak trend where the fraction
of strong Lya emitters ceases to rise, and possibly falls between z~6 and z~7.
Our results also leave open the possibility that strong Lya may still be more
prevalent in the brightest galaxies in the reionization era than their fainter
counterparts. A larger spectroscopic sample of galaxies is required to derive a
more reliable constraint on the neutral hydrogen fraction at z~7 based on the
Lya fraction in the bright galaxies.

usually not solvable by interior point methods or other Newton-type methods due
to the prohibitive computation and storage complexity for Hessians and matrix
inversions. Instead, large scale constrained convex programs are often solved
by gradient based methods or decomposition based methods. The conventional
primal-dual subgradient method, aka, Arrow-Hurwicz-Uzawa subgradient method, is
a low complexity algorithm with the $O(1/\sqrt{t})$ convergence rate, where $t$
is the number of iterations. If the objective and constraint functions are
separable, the Lagrangian dual type method can decompose a large scale convex
program into multiple parallel small scale convex programs. The classical dual
gradient algorithm is an example of Lagrangian dual type methods and has
convergence rate $O(1/\sqrt{t})$. Recently, a new Lagrangian dual type
algorithm with faster $O(1/t)$ convergence is proposed in Yu and Neely (2015).
However, if the objective or constraint functions are not separable, each
iteration of the Lagrangian dual type method in Yu and Neely (2015) requires to
solve a large scale unconstrained convex program, which can have huge
complexity. This paper proposes a new primal-dual type algorithm, which only
involves simple gradient updates at each iteration and has the $O(1/t)$

allowing them to be violated at each round but still requiring them to be
satisfied in the long term. This type of relaxed online convex optimization
(with long term constraints) was first considered in Mahdavi et al. (2012).
That prior work proposes an algorithm to achieve $O(\sqrt{T})$ regret and
$O(T^{3/4})$ constraint violations for general problems and another algorithm
to achieve an $O(T^{2/3})$ bound for both regret and constraint violations when
the constraint set can be described by a finite number of linear constraints. A
recent extension in \citet{Jenatton16ICML} can achieve
$O(T^{\max\{\theta,1-\theta\}})$ regret and $O(T^{1-\theta/2})$ constraint
violations where $\theta\in (0,1)$. The current paper proposes a new simple

support, called an MC-IS network, which has not been studied in the literature.
To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to study such an MC-IS network.
Our proposed MC-IS network has a number of advantages over three existing
conventional networks, namely a single-channel wireless ad hoc network (called
an SC-AH network), a multi-channel wireless ad hoc network (called an MC-AH
network) and a single-channel network with infrastructure support (called an
SC-IS network). In particular, the network capacity of our proposed MC-IS
network is $\sqrt{n \log n}$ times higher than that of an SC-AH network and an
MC-AH network and the same as that of an SC-IS network, where $n$ is the number
of nodes in the network. The average delay of our MC-IS network is $\sqrt{\log
n/n}$ times lower than that of an SC-AH network and an MC-AH network, and
$\min\{C_I,m\}$ times lower than the average delay of an SC-IS network, where
$C_I$ and $m$ denote the number of channels dedicated for infrastructure
communications and the number of interfaces mounted at each infrastructure
node, respectively. Our analysis on an MC-IS network equipped with
omni-directional antennas only has been extended to an MC-IS network equipped
with directional antennas only, which are named as an MC-IS-DA network. We show
that an MC-IS-DA network has an even lower delay of $\frac{c}{\lfloor
\frac{2\pi}{\theta}\rfloor \cdot C_I}$ compared with an SC-IS network and our
MC-IS network. For example, when $C_I=12$ and $\theta=\frac{\pi}{12}$, an
MC-IS-DA network can further reduce the delay by 24 times lower that of an
MC-IS network and reduce the delay by 288 times lower than that of an SC-IS

of the effective operator parameters, reducing the model dependence to a
minimal level. In the parameter region where such a model-independent analysis
is applicable, and leaving aside the special dark matter mass regions where the
annihilation proceeds through an s-channel Z or Higgs boson pole, the current
constraints allow effective operator suppression scales ($\Lambda$) of the
order of a few hundred GeV for dark matter masses $m_\chi >$ 20 GeV at $95\%$
C.L., while the maximum allowed scale is around $3$ TeV for $m_\chi \sim
\mathcal{O}(1\,{\rm TeV})$. An estimate of the future reach of ton-scale direct
detection experiments and planned electron-positron colliders show that most of
the remaining regions can be probed, apart from dark matter masses near half of
the Z-boson mass (with $500\,{\rm GeV} < \Lambda < 2\,{\rm TeV} $) and those
beyond the kinematic reach of the future lepton colliders.

pure dephasing assists the generation of quantum entanglement at distant sites

been tackled either by aligning the long reads against each other or by a
hybrid approach that uses the more accurate short reads produced by second

phases: first we use an iterative alignment-free correction method based on de

are further polished using long-distance dependencies that are found using

$\mathit{SQ}_{\mathrm{op}}(n,O(1))=\Theta(n)$. The upper bounds have quadratic
dependence on the alphabet size for order-preserving squares and exponential
dependence for parameterized squares.
  As a side result we construct infinite words over the smallest alphabet which

analyzed with the help of a latest non linear analysis technique called

all parts of the Film music and the renderings from the eminent maestros are
analyzed to find out a cross correlation coefficient ({\gamma}x) which gives
the degree of correlation between these two signals. We hypothesize that the
parts which have the highest degree of cross correlation are the parts in which
that particular raga is established in the song. Also the variation of cross
correlation coefficient in the different parts of the two samples gives a
measure of the modulation that is executed by the singer. Thus, in nutshell we
try to study scientifically the amount of correlation that exists between the
raga and the same raga being utilized in Film music. This will help in
generating an automated algorithm through which a na\""ive listener will relish

on horizontal position. Effects of horizontal medium-parameter variation can be
quantified by coupled-mode models, with coupling between mode expansions for
laterally homogeneous parts of the medium. In the present paper, these effects
are illustrated for media with a particularly simple horizontal parameter
variation such that mode shapes do not vary with horizontal position. The modal
wavenumbers depend on horizontal position, however. At a vertical interface
between regions with laterally homogeneous medium parameters, each mode is
reflected as well as transmitted. For the media considered, reflection and
transmission coefficients can be computed separately for each mode without mode
coupling, and this is done recursively, stepping through the laterally
homogeneous regions in appropriate order. Continuous-wave as well as pulse

traditional mode of musical training and education. Every Gharana has its own
distinct features; though within a particular Gharana, significant differences
in singing styles are observed between generations of performers, which can be
ascribed to the individual creativity of that singer. This work aims to study
the evolution of singing style among four artists of four consecutive
generations from Patiala Gharana. For this, alap and bandish parts of two
different Ragas sung by the four artists were analyzed with the help of non
linear multifractal analysis (MFDFA) technique. The multifractal spectral width
obtained from the MFDFA method gives an estimate of the complexity of the
signal. The observations from the variation of spectral width give a cue
towards the scientific recognition of Guru-Shisya Parampara (teacher-student
tradition) - a hitherto much-heard philosophical term. From a quantitative
approach this study succeeds in analyzing the evolution of singing styles
within a particular Gharana over generations of artists as well as the effect
of globalization in the field of classical music.

PIV and hot-wire measurements give quantitative information on the flow. It is
shown that the flow exits the pipe as a swirling annulus with a rotation

follows a nearly circular path in the exit plane. The PIV measurements also

various specimen made of plexiglas and Bentheim sandstone. Finite element

find some exact solutions with perfect fluid distribution for spatially flat
FLRW metric and null aether propagating along the $x$ direction. We observe
that there are solutions in which the universe has big-bang singularity and
null field diminishes asymptotically. We also study exact gravitational wave
solutions--AdS-plane waves and $pp$-waves--in this theory in any dimension

top-down mass spectrometry suffers from a lack of sensitivity since the ion
counts for a single fragmentation event are often low. In contrast, nanopore
technology is exquisitely sensitive to single intact molecules, but it has only
been successfully applied to DNA sequencing, so far. Here, we explore the
potential of sub-nanopores for single-molecule protein identification (SMPI)
and describe an algorithm for identification of the electrical current blockade
signal (nanospectrum) resulting from the translocation of a denaturated,
linearly charged protein through a sub-nanopore. The analysis of identification
p-values suggests that the current technology is already sufficient for
matching nanospectra against small protein databases, e.g., protein
identification in bacterial proteomes.

parse the scene image into a structured configuration (i.e., a semantic object
hierarchy with object interaction relations) that finely accords with human
perception. We propose a deep architecture consisting of two networks: i) a
convolutional neural network (CNN) extracting the image representation for
pixelwise object labeling and ii) a recursive neural network (RNN) discovering
the hierarchical object structure and the inter-object relations. Rather than
relying on elaborative user annotations (e.g., manually labeling semantic maps
and relations), we train our deep model in a weakly-supervised manner by
leveraging the descriptive sentences of the training images. Specifically, we
decompose each sentence into a semantic tree consisting of nouns and verb
phrases, and facilitate these trees discovering the configurations of the
training images. Once these scene configurations are determined, then the
parameters of both the CNN and RNN are updated accordingly by back propagation.
The entire model training is accomplished through an Expectation-Maximization
method. Extensive experiments suggest that our model is capable of producing
meaningful and structured scene configurations and achieving more favorable
scene labeling performance on PASCAL VOC 2012 over other state-of-the-art
weakly-supervised methods.

the Higgs decays becoming more faster when entering the equilibrium at

relations which have been collected as a step of these algorithms. Relations
are written multiplicatively as a set of valuations. All the algorithms

  We are interested in studying the limit behavior of the three-dimensional
problems and their solutions (displacements $\mathbf{u}^\varepsilon$ of
components $u_i^\varepsilon$) when $\varepsilon$ tends to zero. To do that, we
use asymptotic analysis methods. First, we formulate the variational problem in
a fixed domain independent of $\varepsilon$. Then we assume an asymptotic
expansion of the scaled displacements field
$\mathbf{u}(\varepsilon)=(u_i(\varepsilon))$. Identifying the terms of the
proposed asymptotic expansion we characterize the zeroth order term as the
solution of a two-dimensional scaled limit problem. Moreover, on one hand, we
find that if the applied body force density is $O(1)$ with respect to
$\varepsilon$ and surface tractions density is $O(\varepsilon)$, the limit of
the field $\mathbf{u}(\varepsilon)$ is the solution of a two-dimensional system
of variational equations called viscoelastic membrane problem. On the other

tractions density is $O(\varepsilon^3)$, the limit of the field
$\mathbf{u}(\varepsilon)$ is the solution of a system of two-dimensional
variational equations called viscoelastic flexural problem.

corresponds to the proposed two-phase accretion model, which may be responsible

well described by the Band function, which is a two smoothly jointed power laws

reduces to a cut-off power law, while above the breaking energy it is a simple
power law. However, for some detectors (such as the Swift-BAT) whose working
energy is well below or just near the breaking energy, the observed spectra can
be fitted to cut-off power law with enough precision. Besides, since the energy
band of Swift-BAT is very narrow, the spectra of most GRBs can be fitted well
even using a simple power law. In this paper, with the most up-to-date sample
of Swift-BAT GRBs, we study the effect of different spectral models on the
empirical luminosity correlations, and further investigate the effect on the
reconstruction of GRB Hubble diagram. We mainly focus on two luminosity
correlations, i.e., the Amati relation and Yonetoku relation. We calculate
these two luminosity correlations on both the case that the GRB spectra are
modeled by Band function and cut-off power law. It is found that both
luminosity correlations only moderately depend on the choice of GRB spectra.
Monte Carlo simulations show that Amati relation is insensitive to the

PMAS/PPak mounted on the 3.5m telescope at the Calar Alto Observatory. Three
different spectral setups are available, i) a low-resolution V500 setup
covering the wavelength range 3749-7500 AA (4240-7140 AA unvignetted) with a
spectral resolution of 6.0 AA (FWHM), for 646 galaxies, ii) a medium-resolution
V1200 setup covering the wavelength range 3650-4840 AA (3650-4620 AA
unvignetted) with a spectral resolution of 2.3 AA (FWHM), for 484 galaxies, and
iii) the combination of the cubes from both setups (called COMBO), with a
spectral resolution of 6.0 AA and a wavelength range between 3700-7500 AA
(3700-7140 AA unvignetted), for 446 galaxies. The Main Sample, selected and
observed according to the CALIFA survey strategy covers a redshift range
between 0.005 and 0.03, spans the color-magnitude diagram and probes a wide
range of stellar mass, ionization conditions, and morphological types. The
Extension Sample covers several types of galaxies that are rare in the overall
galaxy population and therefore not numerous or absent in the CALIFA Main
Sample. All the cubes in the data release were processed using the latest
pipeline, which includes improved versions of the calibration frames and an
even further improved im- age reconstruction quality. In total, the third data
release contains 1576 datacubes, including ~1.5 million independent spectra. It
is available at http://califa.caha.es/DR3.

spectrum. Any instrumental imperfections that couple temperature fluctuations
to B-mode polarisation must therefore be carefully controlled and/or removed.
We investigate the role that a scan strategy can have in mitigating certain
common systematics by averaging systematic errors down with many crossing
angles. We present approximate analytic forms for the error on the recovered
B-mode power spectrum that would result from differential gain, differential
pointing and differential ellipticity for the case where two detector pairs are
used in a polarisation experiment. We use these analytic predictions to search
the parameter space of common satellite scan strategies in order to identify
those features of a scan strategy that have most impact in mitigating
systematic effects. As an example we go on to identify a scan strategy suitable
for the CMB satellite proposed for the ESA M5 call. considering the practical
considerations of fuel requirement, data rate and the relative orientation of
the telescope to the earth. Having chosen a scan strategy we then go on to
investigate the suitability of the scan strategy.

  reconstruction methods","32 pages, 13 figures",,,,"math.NA cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In many applications of tomography, the acquired projections are either
limited in number or contain a significant amount of noise. In these cases,
standard reconstruction methods tend to produce artifacts that can make further
analysis difficult. Advanced regularized iterative methods, such as total
variation minimization, are often able to achieve a higher reconstruction
quality by exploiting prior knowledge about the scanned object. In practice,
however, these methods often have prohibitively long computation times or large
memory requirements. Furthermore, since they are based on minimizing a global
objective function, regularized iterative methods need to reconstruct the
entire scanned object, even when one is only interested in a (small) region of
the reconstructed image.
  In this paper, we present a method to approximate regularized iterative
reconstruction methods inside a (small) region of the scanned object. The
method only performs computations inside the region of interest, ensuring low
computational requirements. Reconstruction results for different phantom images
and types of regularization are given, showing that reconstructions of the
proposed local method are almost identical to those of the global regularized
iterative methods that are approximated, even for relatively small regions of
interest. Furthermore, we show that larger regions can be reconstructed
efficiently by reconstructing several small regions in parallel and combining
them into a single reconstruction afterwards.

for titanium oxide and vanadium oxide absorption. Enhanced opacity is also
inferred across the 1.12-1.3 micron wavelength range, possibly due to iron
hydride absorption. If confirmed, WASP-121b will be the first exoplanet with
titanium oxide, vanadium oxide, and iron hydride detected in transmission. The

Cosmic Rays (CRs). In the last few years, the wealth of gamma-ray data
collected by GeV and TeV instruments has provided important information about
particle energisation in these astrophysical sources, allowing us to make
progress in assessing their role as CR accelerators. In particular, the
spectrum of the gamma-ray emission detected by AGILE and Fermi-LAT from the two
middle aged Supernova Remnants (SNRs) W44 and IC443, has been proposed as a
proof of CR acceleration in SNRs. Here we discuss the possibility that the
radio and gamma-ray spectra from W44 may be explained in terms of
re-acceleration and compression of Galactic CRs. The recent measurement of the
interstellar CR flux by Voyager I has been instrumental for our work, in that
the result of the reprocessing of CRs by the shock in W44 depends on the CR
spectrum at energies that are precluded to terrestrial measurement due to solar
modulation. We introduce both CR protons and helium nuclei in our calculations,
and secondary electrons produced in situ are compared with the flux of Galactic
CR electrons reprocessed by the slow shock of this SNR.We find that the
multi-wavelength spectrum of W44 can be explained by reaccelerated particles
with no need of imposing any break on their distribution, but just a high
energy cut-off at the maximum energy the accelerator can provide.We also find
that a model including both re-acceleration and a very small fraction of
freshly accelerated particles may be more satisfactory on physical grounds

recover a function of the source and the side information. By viewing cache
aided networks in terms of a general distributed source coding problem and
through information theoretic arguments, we present inner and outer bounds on
the fundamental tradeoff of cache memory size and update rate. Then, we
specialize our general inner and outer bounds to a specific model of content
delivery networks: File selection networks, in which the database is a
collection of independent equal-size files and each user requests one of the
files independently. For file selection networks, we provide an outer bound and
two inner bounds (for centralized and decentralized caching strategies). For
the case when the user request information is uniformly distributed, we
characterize the rate vs. cache size tradeoff to within a multiplicative gap of
4. By further extending our arguments to the framework of Maddah-Ali and
Niesen, we also establish a new outer bound and two new inner bounds in which

applications brings the power of high performance computing to a wider range of
users. However, programming these devices and integrating their use in existing
applications is still a challenging task.
  In this paper we examined the potential of GPUs for two different
applications. The first application, created at Paul Scherrer Institut (PSI),
is used for parameter fitting during data analysis of muSR (muon spin rotation,
relaxation and resonance) experiments. The second application, developed at
ETH, is used for PET (Positron Emission Tomography) image reconstruction and
analysis. Applications currently in use were examined to identify parts of the
algorithms in need of optimization. Efficient GPU kernels were created in order
to allow applications to use a GPU, to speed up the previously identified
parts. Benchmarking tests were performed in order to measure the achieved
speedup
  During this work, we focused on single GPU systems to show that real time
data analysis of these problems can be achieved without the need for large
computing clusters. The results show that the currently used application for
parameter fitting, which uses OpenMP to parallelize calculations over multiple
CPU cores, can be accelerated around 40 times through the use of a GPU. The
speedup may vary depending on the size and complexity of the problem. For PET
image analysis, the obtained speedups of the GPU version was more than x40
larger compared to a single core CPU implementation. The achieved results show
that it is possible to improve the execution time by orders of magnitude.

regression model that is a generalization of Liu-type estimator proposed for
the linear model in [12]. Since the variance of the maximum likelihood
estimator (MLE) is inflated when there is multicollinearity between the
explanatory variables, a new biased estimator is proposed to solve the problem
and decrease the variance of MLE in order to make stable inferences. Moreover,
we obtain some theoretical comparisons between the new estimator and some
others via matrix mean squared error (MMSE) criterion. Furthermore, a Monte
Carlo simulation study is designed to evaluate performances of the estimators
in the sense of mean squared error. Finally, a real data application is used to
illustrate the benefits of new estimator.

predicts a student's future response given previous responses using two
publicly available and one proprietary data set. We find that IRT-based methods
consistently matched or outperformed DKT across all data sets at the finest
level of content granularity that was tractable for them to be trained on. A
hierarchical extension of IRT that captured item grouping structure performed
best overall. When data sets included non-trivial autocorrelations in student
response patterns, a temporal extension of IRT improved performance over
standard IRT while the RNN-based method did not. We conclude that IRT-based
models provide a simpler, better-performing alternative to existing RNN-based
models of student interaction data while also affording more interpretability
and guarantees due to their formulation as Bayesian probabilistic models.

evolution of spatially inhomogeneous systems with long-range interactions, the
so-called inhomogeneous Landau equation, by relying on a functional integral
formalism. We start from the BBGKY hierarchy derived from the Liouville
equation. At the order ${1/N}$, where $N$ is the number of particles, the
evolution of the system is characterised by its 1-body distribution function
and its 2-body correlation function. Introducing associated auxiliary fields,
the evolution of these quantities may be rewritten as a traditional functional
integral. By functionally integrating over the 2-body autocorrelation, one
obtains a new constraint connecting the 1-body DF and the auxiliary fields.
When inverted, this constraint allows us to obtain the closed non-linear
kinetic equation satisfied by the 1-body distribution function. This derivation
provides an alternative to previous methods, either based on the direct
resolution of the truncated BBGKY hierarchy or on the Klimontovich equation. It
may turn out to be fruitful to derive more accurate kinetic equations, e.g.,
accounting for collective effects, or higher order correlation terms.

fluid, the helicity $\int_{M} {V}\cdot\omega\,d^3x$, ($V$ the flow velocity,
$\omega=\nabla\times V$, and ${M}$ the three-dimensional domain containing the

the (generalized) enstrophy emerges as a compensating constant. This transition
of the constants of motion is a reflection of an essential difference between
2D and 3D systems, because the conservation of the (generalized) enstrophy
imposes stronger constraints, than the helicity, on the flow. In this paper, we
make a deeper inquiry into the helicity-enstrophy interplay: the ideal fluid
mechanics is cast into a Hamiltonian form in the phase space of Clebsch
parameters, generalizing 2D to a wider category of epi-2D flows (2D embedded in
3D has zero helicity, while the converse is not true -- our epi-2D category
encompasses a wider class of zero-helicity flows); how helicity degenerates and
is substituted by a new constant is delineated; and how a further generalized
enstrophy is introduced as a constant of motion applying to epi-2D flow is

suggests that an asteroid with 100 km radius is encountered $10^{14}$ times
during the lifetime of the Solar System by objects larger than 10 cm in radius;
the formed craters cover the surface of the asteroid about 100 times. We
present a Monte Carlo code that takes into account the statistical bombardment
of individual infinitesimally small surface elements, the subsequent compaction
of the underlying material, the formation of a crater and a regolith layer. For
the entire asteroid, 10,000 individual surface elements are calculated. We
compare the ejected material from the calculated craters with the shock stage
of meteorites with low petrologic type and find that these most likely stem
from smaller parent bodies that do not possess a significant regolith layer.
For larger objects, which accrete a regolith layer, a prediction of the
thickness depending on the largest visible crater can be made. Additionally, we
compare the crater distribution of an object initially 100 km in radius with
the shape model of the asteroid (21) Lutetia, assuming it to be initially
formed spherical with a radius that is equal to its longest present ellipsoid
length. Here, we find the shapes of both objects to show resemblance to each

be removed in 331 models based on the gauge group $SU(3)_C\times SU(3)_L\times

sensitively on the value of $|V_{cb}|$. Concentrating the analysis on three 331
models that have been selected by us previously on the basis of their
performance in electroweak precision tests and $\varepsilon^\prime/\varepsilon$
we illustrate this for $|V_{cb}|=0.042$ and $|V_{cb}|=0.040$. We find that
these new lattice data still allow for positive shifts in
$\varepsilon^\prime/\varepsilon$ up to $6\times 10^{-4}$ for
  $M_{Z^\prime}=3~TeV$ for both values of $$|V_{cb}|$ but for
$M_{Z^\prime}=10~TeV$ only for $|V_{cb}|=0.040$ such shifts can be obtained. NP
effects in $B_s\to\mu^+\mu^-$ and in the Wilson coefficient $C_9$ are
significantly larger in all three models for the case of $|V_{cb}|=0.040$. In
particular in two models the rate for $B_s\to\mu^+\mu^-$ can be reduced by NP
by $20\%$ for $M_{Z^\prime}=3~TeV$ resulting in values in the ballpark of
central values from CMS and LHCb. In the third model a shift in $C_9$ up to
$C_9^\text{NP}=-0.5$ is possible. We also consider the simplest 331 model,
analyzed recently in the literature, in which $X=Y$, the usual hypercharge. We
find that in this model NP effects in flavour observables are much smaller than
in the three models with $X\not=Y$, in particular NP contributions to the ratio
  $\varepsilon^\prime/\varepsilon$ are very strongly suppressed.

result of seal erosion between a rotor and stator disk in an engine, and
deterioration over the life of an engine. The density-matching technique for

carried out to determine why exactly the new design is more insensitive to the
effects of leakage flows. Specifically, it is shown that this insensitivity is
attributed to three main factors: a slight rearward shift in loading, and thus
a reduction in incidence; a reduction in the cross-passage pressure gradient;
and a re-acceleration of the flow towards the trailing edge, which prevented
any corner separation.

performance of the KNN classifier and is useful in many real-world
applications. Many metric learning algorithms are however based on the point
estimation of a quadratic optimization problem, which is time-consuming,
susceptible to overfitting, and lack a natural mechanism to reason with
parameter uncertainty, an important property useful especially when the
training set is small and/or noisy. To deal with these issues, we present a
novel Bayesian metric learning method, called Bayesian NCA, based on the
well-known Neighbourhood Component Analysis method, in which the metric
posterior is characterized by the local label consistency constraints of
observations, encoded with a similarity graph instead of independent pairwise
constraints. For efficient Bayesian optimization, we explore the variational
lower bound over the log-likelihood of the original NCA objective. Experiments
on several publicly available datasets demonstrate that the proposed method is
able to learn robust metric measures from small size dataset and/or from
challenging training set with labels contaminated by errors. The proposed
method is also shown to outperform a previous pairwise constrained Bayesian
metric learning method.

complexity models allowing to derive meaningful lower bounds for whole classes
of randomized search heuristics. Complementing classical runtime analysis,
black-box models help us understand how algorithmic choices such as the
population size, the variation operators, or the selection rules influence the
optimization time. One example for such a result is the $\Omega(n \log n)$
lower bound for unary unbiased algorithms on functions with a unique global
optimum [Lehre/Witt, GECCO 2010], which tells us that higher arity operators or
biased sampling strategies are needed when trying to beat this bound. In lack
of analyzing techniques, almost no non-trivial bounds are known for other
restricted models. Proving such bounds therefore remains to be one of the main
challenges in black-box complexity theory.
  With this paper we contribute to our technical toolbox for lower bound
computations by proposing a new type of information-theoretic argument. We
regard the permutation- and bit-invariant version of \textsc{LeadingOnes} and
prove that its (1+1) elitist black-box complexity is $\Omega(n^2)$, a bound
that is matched by (1+1)-type evolutionary algorithms. The (1+1) elitist
complexity of \textsc{LeadingOnes} is thus considerably larger than its
unrestricted one, which is known to be of order $n\log\log n$ [Afshani et al.,

here that govern the process from pre-heating to melting and evaporation. In
particular, the Navier-Stokes equation governing the melt flow is solved with
the use of the boundary layer theory and integral methods. Heat conduction in
solid is investigated by using the classical method with the corrections that
reflect the change in boundary condition from the constant heat flux to Stefan
condition. The dependence of saturation temperature on the vapor pressure is
taken into account by using the Clausius-Clapeyron equation. Both constantly
rising radial velocity profiles and rising-fall velocity profiles are
considered. The proposed approach is compared with existing ones. In spite of
the assumed varying velocity profiles, the proposed model predicts that the
drilling hole profiles are very close to each other in a specific super alloy
for given laser beam intensity and pulse duration. The numerical results show
that the effect of melt flow on material removal can be ignored in some cases.
The findings obtained from the current work provide a better understanding of
the effects of melt flow and vaporization on the laser drilling profile

(ii) viscoelastic Maxwell fluids whose elastic modulus, $G_0$, characteristic
relaxation time, $\tau$, and zero-shear viscosity, $\eta_0=G_0 \tau$, can be
tuned over several orders of magnitude. The sheets are produced by impacting a
drop of fluid on a small cylindrical solid target. For viscoelastic fluids, we
show that, when $\tau$ is shorter than the typical lifetime of the sheet ($\sim
10$ ms), the dynamics of the sheet is similar to that of Newtonian viscous
liquids with equal zero-shear viscosity. In that case, for little viscous
samples ($\eta_0 <\sim 30$ mPa.s), the maximal expansion of the sheet,
$d_{\rm{max}}$, is independent of $\eta_0$, whereas for more viscous samples,
$d_{\rm{max}}$ decreases as $\eta_0$ increases. We provide a simple model to
account for the dependence of the maximal expansion of the sheet with the
viscosity that is based on an energy balance between inertia, surface tension
and viscous shear dissipation on the solid target, and which accounts well for
our experimental data. By contrast, when $\tau$ is longer than the typical
lifetime of the sheet, the behavior drastically differs. The sheet expansion is
strongly enhanced as compared to that of viscous samples with comparable
zero-shear viscosity, but is heterogeneous with the occurrence of cracks,
revealing the elastic nature of the viscoelastic fluid.

useful scaling relations for how the QPO spectrum depends on the bulk

irrelevant, a significant simplification for study of the QPO problem. The

quantities, and there is a case for removing this anomaly by declaring plane
angle to be an additional base quantity within the system. It is shown that
this could bring several benefits in terms of treating angle on an equal basis
with other metrics, removing potentially harmful ambiguities, and bringing SI
units more in line with concepts in basic physics, but at the expense of
significant upheaval to familiar equations within mathematics and physics. This
paper sets out the most important of these changes so that an alternative unit
system containing angle as a base quantity can be seen in the round,
irrespective of whether it is ever widely adopted. The alternative formulas and
units can be treated as the underlying, more general equations of mathematical
physics, independent of the units used for angle, which are conventionally
simplified by implicitly assuming that the unit used for angle is the radian.

complex combination of kernels(non-linear) and not only linear combination.
Evolving non-linear functions of base kernels using Genetic Programming is

yields a group homomorphism $\Phi : Pic(M) / Pic(S) \to Hom(M,M^*)$. We also
prove the Theorem of the Cube for 1-motives, which furnishes another

S field can acquire a large vacuum expectation value due to quantum
fluctuations during inflation. During reheating, it then relaxes to its
equilibrium value, during which time the same operators introduced to explain
the diphoton excess induce a nonzero chemical potential for baryon and lepton
number. Interactions such as those involving right-handed neutrinos allow the
system to develop a non-zero lepton number, and therefore, this state may also
be responsible for the observed cosmological matter-antimatter asymmetry.

number of degrees of freedom on the boundary surface and the number of degrees
of freedom in a bulk region leads to the expansion of the universe. Now, a
natural question arises, how this model could explain the oscillation of
universe between contraction and expansion branches? We try to address this
issue in the framework of BIonic system. In this model, $M0$-branes join to
each other and give rise to a pair of $M1$-anti-$M1$-branes. The fields which
live on these branes play the roles of massive gravitons that cause the
emergence of a wormhole between them and formation of a BIon system. This
wormhole dissolves into M1-branes and causes a divergence between the number of
degrees of freedom on the boundary surface of $M1$ and the bulk leading to an
expansion of $M1$-branes. When $M1$-branes become close to each other, the
square energy of their system becomes negative and some tachyonic states
emerge. To removes these states, $M1$-branes compact, the sign of compacted
gravity changes, causing the arising of anti-gravity: in this case, branes get
away from each other. By articulating $M1$-BIons, an M3-brane and an
anti-$M3$-brane are created and connected by three wormholes forming an
$M3$-BIon. This new system behaves like the initial system and by closing
branes to each other, they compact and, by getting away from each other, they
open. Our universe is located on one of these M3-branes and, by compacting
$M3$-brane, it contracts and, by opening it, it expands.

"1605.04949","Manuel Lafond","Manuel Lafond","How brokers can optimally plot against traders",,,,,"q-fin.TR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Traders buy and sell financial instruments in hopes of making profit, and
brokers are responsible for the transaction. There are several hypotheses and
conspiracy theories arguing that in some situations, brokers want their traders
to lose money. For instance, a broker may want to protect the positions of a
privileged customer. Another example is that some brokers take positions
opposite to their traders', in which case they make money whenever their
traders lose money. These are reasons for which brokers might manipulate prices
in order to maximize the losses of their traders.
  In this paper, our goal is to perform this shady task optimally -- or at
least to check whether this can actually be done algorithmically. Assuming
total control over the price of an asset (ignoring the usual aspects of finance
such as market conditions, external influence or stochasticity), we show how in
quadratic time, given a set of trades specified by a stop-loss and a
take-profit price, a broker can find a maximum loss price movement. We also
look at an online trade model where broker and trader exchange turns, each
trying to make a profit. We show in which condition either side can make a
profit, and that the best option for the trader is to never trade.

the matter-induced physical geometry was built and an intrinsic nonlinearity of
the Dirac equation discovered. Here, the nonlinear Dirac equation is solved and
the localized configurations are found analytically. Of the two possible types
of the potentially stationary localized configurations of the Dirac field, only
one is stable with respect to the action of an external field and it
corresponds to a positive charge. A connection with the global charge asymmetry
of matter in the Universe and with the recently observed excess of the cosmic
positrons is discussed.
