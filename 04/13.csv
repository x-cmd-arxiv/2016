  Applications","Updated Figure 3",,,,"stat.ML","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  While the Matrix Generalized Inverse Gaussian ($\mathcal{MGIG}$) distribution
arises naturally in some settings as a distribution over symmetric positive
semi-definite matrices, certain key properties of the distribution and
effective ways of sampling from the distribution have not been carefully
studied. In this paper, we show that the $\mathcal{MGIG}$ is unimodal, and the
mode can be obtained by solving an Algebraic Riccati Equation (ARE) equation
[7]. Based on the property, we propose an importance sampling method for the
$\mathcal{MGIG}$ where the mode of the proposal distribution matches that of
the target. The proposed sampling method is more efficient than existing
approaches [32, 33], which use proposal distributions that may have the mode
far from the $\mathcal{MGIG}$'s mode. Further, we illustrate that the the
posterior distribution in latent factor models, such as probabilistic matrix
factorization (PMF) [25], when marginalized over one latent factor has the
$\mathcal{MGIG}$ distribution. The characterization leads to a novel Collapsed
Monte Carlo (CMC) inference algorithm for such latent factor models. We
illustrate that CMC has a lower log loss or perplexity than MCMC, and needs
fewer samples.

homology for manifolds with torus boundary. If $M$ is such a manifold, we show
that the type D structure $\widehat{\mathit{CFD}}$ may be viewed as a set of
immersed curves decorated with local systems in $\partial M$. These
curves-with-decoration are invariants of the underlying three-manifold up to
regular homotopy of the curves and isomorphism of the local systems. Given two
such manifolds and a homeomorphism $h$ between the boundary tori, the Heegaard
Floer homology of the closed manifold obtained by gluing with $h$ is obtained
from the Lagrangian intersection Floer homology of the curve-sets. This
machinery has several applications: We establish that the dimension of
$\widehat{\mathit{HF}}$ decreases under a certain class of degree one maps
(pinches) and we establish that the existence of an essential separating torus
gives rise to a lower bound on the dimension of $\widehat{\mathit{HF}}$. In
particular, it follows that a prime rational homology sphere $Y$ with
$\widehat{\mathit{HF}}(Y)<5$ must be geometric. Other results include a new
proof of Eftekhary's theorem that L-space homology spheres are atoroidal; a
complete characterisation of toroidal L-spaces in terms of gluing data; and a
proof of a conjecture of Hom, Lidman, and Vafaee on satellite L-space knots.

the analytical calculation is to relate the displacement correlation tensor,
which is a kind of four-point space-time correlation, to the Lagrangian
two-time correlation of the deformation gradient tensor. Tensorial treatment of
the statistical quantities, including the displacement correlation itself,
allows capturing the vortical structure of the cooperative motion. The
calculated displacement correlation also implies a negative longtime tail in
the velocity autocorrelation, which is a manifestation of the cage effect. Both
the longitudinal and transverse components of the displacement correlation are
found to be expressible in terms of a similarity variable, suggesting that the
cages are nested to form a self-similar structure in the space-time.

service-driven information and communication technology (ICT), into a
signifcant fraction of the ICT market. Responding to the growth of the market,
many alternative cloud services and their underlying systems are currently
vying for the attention of cloud users and providers. Thus, benchmarking them
is needed, to enable cloud users to make an informed choice, and to enable
system DevOps to tune, design, and evaluate their systems. This requires
focusing on old and new system properties, possibly leading to the re-design of
classic benchmarking metrics, such as expressing performance as throughput and
latency (response time), and the design of new, cloud-specififc metrics.
Addressing this requirement, in this work we focus on four system properties:
(i) elasticity of the cloud service, to accommodate large variations in the
amount of service requested, (ii) performance isolation between the tenants of
shared cloud systems, (iii) availability of cloud services and systems, and the
(iv) operational risk of running a production system in a cloud
environment.Focusing on key metrics, for each of these properties we review the
state-of-the-art, then select or propose new metrics together with measurement
approaches. We see the presented metrics as a foundation towards upcoming,
industry-standard, cloud benchmarks.

automatically from its specification. This often requires assumptions about the
behaviour of the environment. It is difficult for the designer to identify the
assumptions that ensures the existence of a correct controller, and doing so
manually can lead to assumptions that are stronger than necessary. As a
consequence the generated controllers are suboptimal in terms of generality and
robustness. In this work, given a specification, we identify the weakest
assumptions that ensures the existence of a controller. We also consider two
important classes of assumptions: the ones that can be ensured by the
environment and assumptions that speaks only about inputs of the systems. We
show that optimal assumptions correspond to strongly winning strategies,
admissible strategies and remorsefree strategies respectively. Based on this
correspondence, we propose an algorithm for computing optimal assumptions that
can be ensured by the environment.

At the same time, the modifications of the geometry do not affect the

(decreasing) the strength of the magnetic field or the confining potential is
found to be analogous to shrinking (expanding) the size of the quantum dots:
resulting into a blue (red) shift in the absorption spectrum. The Fermi energy
diminishes with both increasing magnetic-field and dot-size; and exhibits
saw-tooth-like oscillations at large values of field or dot-size. Unlike

edge over the strictly two-dimensional quantum dots in that the additional

a better insight into promising applications involving lasers, detectors,

thus, new network alignment methods are needed. Result: In this paper, we
present a novel method, denoted as ConvexAlign, for joint alignment of multiple
PPI networks by convex optimization of a scoring function composed of sequence
similarity, topological score and interaction conservation score. In contrast
to existing methods that generate multiple alignments in a greedy or
progressive manner, our convex method optimizes alignments globally and
enforces consistency among all pairwise alignments, resulting in much better
alignment quality. Tested on both synthetic and real data, our experimental
results show that ConvexAlign outperforms several popular methods in producing
functionally coherent alignments. ConvexAlign even has a larger advantage over
the others in aligning real PPI networks. ConvexAlign also finds a few
conserved complexes among 5 species which cannot be detected by the other
methods.

particular examples we consider self-accelerating Covariant Galileons,
Brans-Dicke theory and parameterizations based on the effective field theory of
dark energy, using the \hiclass\, code to address the impact of these models on
relativistic corrections to LSS observables. We find that especially effects
which involve integrals along the line of sight (lensing convergence, time
delay and the integrated Sachs-Wolfe effect -- ISW) can be considerably
modified, and even lead to $\mathcal{O}(1000\%)$ deviations from General
Relativity in the case of the ISW effect for Galileon models, for which
standard probes such as the growth function only vary by $\mathcal{O}(10\%)$.
These effects become dominant when correlating galaxy number counts at
different redshifts and can lead to $\sim 50\%$ deviations in the total signal
that might be observable by future LSS surveys. Because of their integrated
nature, these deep-redshift cross-correlations are sensitive to modifications
of gravity even when probing eras much before dark energy domination. We
further isolate the ISW effect using the cross-correlation between LSS and CMB
temperature anisotropies and use current data to further constrain Horndeski

approximation. The problem involves two length scales: ${\it
l}_0=\sqrt{\hbar/m^*\omega_0}$ and ${\it l}_c=\sqrt{\hbar/m^*\omega_c}$, which
characterize the strengths of the confinement and the magnetic field ($B$).
Essentially, we focus on the device aspects of the intersubband collective
(magnetoroton) excitation, which observes a negative group velocity between
maxon and roton. Consequently, it leads to tachyon-like (superluminal) behavior
without one's having to introduce the negative energies. Existence of the
negative group velocity is a clear manifestation of a medium with population
inversion brought about due to a metastable state caused by the magnetic field
that satisfies the condition $B> B_{th}$; $B_{th}$ being the threshold value
below which the magnetoroton does not exist. The interest in negative group
velocity is based on anomalous dispersion in a medium with inverted population,
so that gain instead of absorption occurs at the frequencies of interest. A
medium with an inverted population has the remarkable ability of amplifying a
small optical signal of definite wavelength, i.e., it can serve as an {\em
active} laser medium. An extensive scrutiny of the gain coefficient suggests an
interesting and important application: the electronic device designed on the
basis of such magnetoroton modes can act as an optical amplifier. Examining the
magnetic-field dependence of the life-time of magnetorotons leads us to infer
that relatively smaller magnetic fields are optimal.

attention for its real world applications, such as recommender systems and
computer vision. Much of the existing work has focused on matrices with
low-rank structure, and limited progress has been made matrices with other
types of structure. In this paper we present non-asymptotic analysis for
estimation of generally structured matrices via the generalized Dantzig
selector under generic sub-Gaussian measurements. We show that the estimation
error can always be succinctly expressed in terms of a few geometric measures
of suitable sets which only depend on the structure of the underlying true
matrix. In addition, we derive the general bounds on these geometric measures
for structures characterized by unitarily invariant norms, which is a large
family covering most matrix norms of practical interest. Examples are provided
to illustrate the utility of our theoretical development.

on the effect of varying monitoring strategies, i.e. for a given decoherence

monitor a quantum system. We show here that there is a region between the deep
quantum regime and the classical limit where the choice of the monitoring

GPU-FV in a way that utilizes the computing power of GPU as much as possible,

averages out to a smooth Friedmann-Lemaitre-Robertson-Walker (FLRW) model. The
root of the problem is that averaging does not commute with the Einstein
equations that govern the dynamics of the model. This leads to the well-know
question of backreaction in cosmology. In this work, we approach the problem
using the covariant framework of Macroscopic Gravity (MG). We use its
cosmological solution with a flat FLRW macroscopic background where the result
of averaging cosmic inhomogeneities has been encapsulated into a backreaction
density parameter denoted $\Omega_\mathcal{A}$. We constrain this averaged
universe using available cosmological data sets of expansion and growth
including, for the first time, a full CMB analysis from Planck temperature
anisotropy and polarization data, the supernovae data from Union 2.1, the
galaxy power spectrum from WiggleZ, the weak lensing tomography shear-shear

oscillation data from 6Df, SDSS DR7 and BOSS DR9. We find that $-0.0155 \le
\Omega_\mathcal{A} \le 0$ (at the 68\% CL) thus providing a tight upper-bound
on the backreaction term. We also find that the term is strongly correlated
with cosmological parameters such $\Omega_\Lambda$, $\sigma_8$ and $H_0$. While
small, a backreaction density parameter of a few percent should be kept in

show content items according to users' personal interests. In order to achieve
such goal, these systems are learning user interests over time and trying to
present content items tailoring to user profiles. Recommending items according
to users' preferences has been investigated extensively in the past few years,
mainly thanks for the popularity of Netflix competition. In a real setting,
users may be attracted by a subset of those items and interact with them, only
leaving partial feedbacks to the system to learn in the next cycle, which leads
to significant biases into systems and hence results in a situation where user
engagement metrics cannot be improved over time. The problem is not just for
one component of the system. The data collected from users is usually used in
many different tasks, including learning ranking functions, building user
profiles and constructing content classifiers. Once the data is biased, all
these downstream use cases would be impacted as well. Therefore, it would be
beneficial to gather unbiased data through user interactions. Traditionally,
unbiased data collection is done through showing items uniformly sampling from
the content pool. However, this simple scheme is not feasible as it risks user
engagement metrics and it takes long time to gather user feedbacks. In this
paper, we introduce a user-friendly unbiased data collection framework, by
utilizing methods developed in the exploitation and exploration literature. We
discuss how the framework is different from normal multi-armed bandit problems
and why such method is needed. We layout a novel Thompson sampling for
Bernoulli ranked-list to effectively balance user experiences and data
collection. The proposed method is validated from a real bucket test and we
show strong results comparing to old algorithms

in many ways to other proposed technologies, being able to defend the Earth

energy planetary defense system that utilizes laser ablation of an asteroid to
impart a deflecting force on the target. A conceptual philosophy called
DE-STAR, which stands for Directed Energy System for Targeting of Asteroids and
exploRation, is an orbiting stand-off system, which has been described in other
papers. This paper describes a smaller, stand-on system known as DE-STARLITE as
a reduced-scale version of DE-STAR. Both share the same basic heritage of a
directed energy array that heats the surface of the target to the point of high
surface vapor pressure that causes significant mass ejection thus forming an
ejection plume of material from the target that acts as a rocket to deflect the
object. This is generally classified as laser ablation. DE-STARLITE uses
conventional propellant for launch to LEO and then ion engines to propel the
spacecraft from LEO to the near-Earth asteroid (NEA). During laser ablation,
the asteroid itself provides the propellant source material; thus a very modest
spacecraft can deflect an asteroid much larger than would be possible with a
system of similar mission mass using ion beam deflection (IBD) or a gravity
tractor. DE- STARLITE is capable of deflecting an Apophis-class (325 m
diameter) asteroid with a 1- to 15-year targeting time (laser on time)
depending on the system design. The mission fits within the rough mission
parameters of the Asteroid Redirect Mission (ARM) program in terms of mass and
size. DE-STARLITE also has much greater capability for planetary defense than
current proposals and is readily scalable to match the threat. It can deflect
all known threats with sufficient warning.

The proposed approach effectively exploits local semantic information preserved

receives as input local semantic features only from the corresponding

by a multi-scale convolutional filter bank used as an initial component of the

organization, the ubiquitous role of YAP/TAZ continues to impact our
fundamental understanding in numerous physiological and disease systems.
YAP/TAZ is an important signaling nexus integrating diverse mechanical and
biochemical signals, such as ECM stiffness, adhesion ligand density, or
cell-cell contacts, and thus strongly influences cell fate. Recent studies show
that YAP/TAZ mechanical sensing is dependent on RhoA-regulated stress fibers.
However, current understanding of YAP/TAZ still remains limited due to the
unknown interaction between the canonical Hippo pathway and cell tension. To
identify the roles of key signaling molecules in mechanical signal sensing and
transduction, we present a novel computational model of the YAP/TAZ signaling
pathway. This model converts ECM mechanical properties to biochemical signals
via adhesion, and integrates intracellular signaling cascades associated with
cytoskeleton dynamics. Adhesion molecules, such as FAK, are predicted to rescue
YAP/TAZ activity in soft environments via the RhoA pathway. We found that
changes of molecule concentrations result in different pattern of YAP/TAZ
stiffness response. We also investigate the sensitivity of YAP/TAZ activity to
ECM stiffness. In addition, the model shows that the unresolved synergistic
effect of YAP/TAZ activity between the mechanosensing and the Hippo pathways
can be explained by the interaction of LIMK and LATS. Overall, our model
provides a novel platform for studying YAP/TAZ activity in the context of
integrating different signaling pathways. This platform can be used to gain new
fundamental insights into roles of key molecular and mechanical regulators on

However, many previous works have been limited to identifying the brighter,
more active members ($\approx$1 M$_\odot$) owing to photometric survey
sensitivities limiting the detections of lower mass objects. We search the
field of view of 542 previously identified members of the young associations to
identify wide or extremely wide (1000-100,000 au in physical separation)
companions. We combined 2MASS near-infrared photometry ($J$, $H$, $K$) with
proper motion values (from UCAC4, PPMXL, NOMAD) to identify companions in the
field of view of known members. We collated further photometry and spectroscopy
from the literature and conducted our own high-resolution spectroscopic
observations for a subsample of candidate members. This complementary
information allowed us to assess the efficiency of our method. We identified 84
targets (45: 0.2-1.3 M$_\odot$, 17: 0.08-0.2 M$_\odot$, 22: $<$0.08 M$_\odot$)
in our analysis, ten of which have been identified from spectroscopic analysis
in previous young association works. For 33 of these 84, we were able to
further assess their membership using a variety of properties (X-ray emission,
UV excess, H$_\alpha$, lithium and K I equivalent widths, radial velocities,
and CaH indices). We derive a success rate of 76-88% for this technique based
on the consistency of these properties. Once confirmed, the targets identified
in this work would significantly improve our knowledge of the lower mass end of
the young associations. Additionally, these targets would make an ideal new
sample for the identification and study of planets around nearby young stars.

core passage, dissociative, binary merger, with the optical galaxy density
peaks of each subcluster leading their associated X-ray emission peaks. This
separation occurs because the diffuse gas experiences ram pressure forces while
the effectively collisionless galaxies (and presumably their associated dark
matter halos) do not. This system contains double peaked diffuse radio
emission, possibly a double radio relic with the relics lying along the merger
axis and also leading the X-ray cores. We find evidence for a temperature peak
associated with the SW relic, likely created by the same merger shock that is
powering the relic radio emission in this region. Thus, this system is a
relatively rare clean example of a dissociative binary merger, which can in
principle be used to place constraints on the self-interaction cross-section of
dark matter. Low frequency radio observations reveal ultra-steep spectrum
diffuse radio emission that is not correlated with the X-ray, optical, or high
frequency radio emission. We suggest that these sources are radio phoenixes,
which are preexisting non-thermal particle populations that have been
re-energized through adiabatic compression by the same merger shocks that power
the radio relics. Finally, we place upper limits on inverse Compton emission

Simulations show that both sizeable binary-star populations and
Intermediate-Mass Black Holes (IMBHs) quench mass-segregation in relaxed GCs.
Thus mass-segregation in GCs with a reliable binary-fraction measurement is a
valuable probe to constrain IMBHs. In this paper we combine mass-segregation
and binary-fraction measurements from the literature to build a sample of 33
GCs (with measured core-binary fractions), and a sample of 43 GCs (with a
binary fraction measurement in the area between the core radius and the
half-mass radius). Within both samples we try to identify IMBH-host candidates.
These should have relatively low mass-segregation, a low binary fraction (<
5%), and short (< 1 Gyr) relaxation time. Considering the core binary fraction
sample, no suitable candidates emerge. If the binary fraction between the core
and the half-mass radius is considered, two candidates are found, but this is
likely due to statistical fluctuations. We also consider a larger sample of 54
GCs where we obtained an estimate of the core binary fraction using a
predictive relation based on metallicity and integrated absolute magnitude.
Also in this case no suitable candidates are found. Finally, we consider the GC
core- to half-mass radius ratio, that is expected to be larger for GCs
containing either an IMBH or binaries. We find that GCs with large core- to
half-mass radius ratios are less mass-segregated (and show a larger binary
fraction), confirming the theoretical expectation that the energy sources

From hardness ratio measurements, we find that 18 AGN with low accretion rates
show hardening with increasing count rate, converse to the softer-when-brighter
behaviour normally observed in AGN with higher accretion rates. Two AGN show
softening with increasing count rate, two show more complex behaviour, and two
do not show any simple relationship.
  Sufficient data were available for the spectra of 13 AGN to be summed in
flux-bins. In 9 of these sources, correlated luminosity-dependent changes in
the photon index ($\Gamma$) of a power-law component are found to be the main
cause of hardness variability. For 6 objects, with a low accretion rate as a
fraction of the Eddington rate (\.m$\mathrm{_{Edd}}$), $\Gamma$ is
anticorrelated with \.m$\mathrm{_{Edd}}$, i.e. `harder-when-brighter' behaviour
is observed. The 3 higher-\.m$\mathrm{_{Edd}}$-rate objects show a positive
correlation between $\Gamma$ and \.m$\mathrm{_{Edd}}$. This transition from
harder-when-brighter at low \.m$\mathrm{_{Edd}}$s to softer-when-brighter at
high \.m$\mathrm{_{Edd}}$s can be explained by a change in the dominant source
of seed-photons for X-ray emission from cyclo-synchrotron emission from the
Comptonising corona itself to thermal seed-photons from the accretion disc.
This transition is also seen in the `hard state' of black hole X-ray binaries
(BHXRBs). The results support the idea that LINERs are analogues of BHXRBs in
the hard state and that Seyferts are analogues of BHXRBs in either the

magnetic impurities coupled to the Kitaev spin-liquid host. We reformulate this
Kondo-type problem in terms of a many-state quantum impurity coupled to a
multichannel bath of Majorana fermions and present the numerically exact
solution using Wilson's numerical renormalization group technique. Quantum
phase transitions occur as a function of Kondo coupling and locally applied
field. At zero field, the impurity moment is partially screened only when it
binds an emergent gauge flux, and otherwise becomes free at low temperatures.
We show how Majorana degrees of freedom determine the fixed-point properties,
make contact with Kondo screening in pseudogap Fermi systems, and discuss
effects away from the dilute limit.

explain the formation of intermediate-mass black holes (IMBHs) in young dense
star clusters. On the other hand, the massive stars that participate in the
runaway collisions lose mass by stellar winds. In this paper, we discuss new
N-body simulations of massive (6.5x10^4 Msun) star clusters, in which we added
upgraded recipes for stellar winds and supernova explosion at different
metallicity. We follow the evolution of the principal collision product (PCP),
through dynamics and stellar evolution, till it forms a stellar remnant. At
solar metallicity, the mass of the final merger product spans from few solar
masses up to ~30 Msun. At low metallicity (0.01-0.1 Zsun) the maximum remnant
mass is ~250 Msun, in the range of IMBHs. A large fraction (~0.6) of the PCPs
are not ejected from the parent star cluster and acquire stellar or black hole
(BH) companions. Most of the long-lived binaries hosting a PCP are BH-BH
binaries. We discuss the importance of this result for gravitational wave
detection.

that they can, on average, be well described by field galaxy templates.
Identification and decomposition of AGN through SED fittings allows us to
include the contribution to cluster SF from AGN host galaxies. We quantify the
star-forming fraction, dust-obscured SF rates (SFRs), and specific-SFRs for
cluster galaxies as a function of cluster-centric radius and redshift. In good
agreement with previous studies, we find that SF in cluster galaxies at
$z\gtrsim1.4$ is largely consistent with field galaxies at similar epochs,
indicating an era before significant quenching in the cluster cores
($r<0.5\,$Mpc). This is followed by a transition to lower SF activity as
environmental quenching dominates by $z\sim1$. Enhanced SFRs are found in lower
mass ($10.1< \log \rm{M_{\star}}/\rm{M_{\odot}}<10.8$) cluster galaxies. We
find significant variation in SF from cluster-to-cluster within our uniformly
selected sample, indicating that caution should be taken when evaluating
individual clusters. We examine AGN in clusters from $z=0.5-2$, finding an
excess AGN fraction at $z\gtrsim1$, suggesting environmental triggering of AGN
during this epoch. We argue that our results $-$ a transition from field-like

coupled with a volume of fluid method is used to model the capillary

Hele-Shaw approximation. We show that the interface between the two fluids
takes the shape of a neck narrowing in the flow direction just before entering
the reservoir, in agreement with our experimental observations. Our
computational model relies on the assumption that the pressure at the boundary,
where the fluid exits into the reservoir, is the uniform pressure in the
reservoir. We investigate this hypothesis by comparing the numerical results

becomes important when the width of the neck is comparable to the depth of the
microchannel. A correction to the exit pressure boundary condition is then
proposed, which is determined by comparison with experimental data. We also

heat transfer is a diffusive process. Here we show how to overcome this
limitation using electrodynamic hot spots and interference effects in the
regime of continuous-wave (CW) excitation. We introduce a set of figures of
merit for the localization of temperature and for the efficiency of the
plasmonic photo-thermal effect. Our calculations show that the temperature
localization in a trimer nanoparticle assembly is a complex function of the
geometry and sizes. Large nanoparticles in the trimer play the role of the
nano-optical antenna whereas the small nanoparticle in the plasmonic hot spot
acts as a nano-heater. Under the peculiar conditions, the temperature increase
inside a nanoparticle trimer can be localized in a hot spot region at the small
heater nanoparticle and, in this way, a thermal hot spot can be realized.
However, the overall power efficiency of temperature generation in this trimer
is much smaller than that of a single nanoparticle. We can overcome the latter
disadvantage by using a trimer with a nanorod. In the trimer assembly composed
of a nanorod and two spherical nanoparticles, we observe a strong plasmonic
Fano effect that leads to the concertation of optical energy dissipation in the
small heater nanorod. Therefore, the power-absorption efficiency of temperature
generation in the nanorod-based assembly greatly increases due to the strong
plasmonic Fano effect. The Fano heater incorporating a small nanorod in the hot
spot has obviously the best performance compared to both single nanocrystals
and a nanoparticle trimer. The principles of heat localization described here
can be potentially used for thermal photo-catalysis, energy conversion and
bio-related applications.

organisms keep track of daily and seasonal time. Circadian clocks frequently
rely on interlocked transcriptional- translational feedback loops to generate
rhythms that are robust against intrinsic and extrinsic perturbations. To
investigate the dynamics and mechanisms of the intracellular feedback loops in
circadian clocks, a number of mathematical models have been developed. The
majority of the models use Hill functions to describe transcriptional
repression in a way that is similar to the Goodwin model. Recently, a new class
of models with protein sequestration-based repression has been introduced.
Here, we discuss how this new class of models differs dramatically from those
based on Hill-type repression in several fundamental aspects: conditions for
rhythm generation, robust network designs and the periods of coupled
oscillators. Consistently, these fundamental properties of circadian clocks
also differ among Neurospora, Drosophila, and mammals depending on their key
transcriptional repression mechanisms (Hill-type repression or protein
sequestration). Based on both theoretical and experimental studies, this review
highlights the importance of careful modeling of transcriptional repression
mechanisms in molecular circadian clocks.

photometric redshifts rather than spectroscopic redshifts. Obtaining accurate
and well-characterized photometric redshift distributions is therefore critical
for Euclid, the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope and the Square Kilometre Array.
However, determining accurate variance predictions alongside single point
estimates is crucial, as they can be used to optimize the sample of galaxies
for the specific experiment (e.g. weak lensing, baryon acoustic oscillations,
supernovae), trading off between completeness and reliability in the galaxy
sample. The various sources of uncertainty in measurements of the photometry
and redshifts put a lower bound on the accuracy that any model can hope to
achieve. The intrinsic uncertainty associated with estimates is often
non-uniform and input-dependent, commonly known in statistics as
heteroscedastic noise. However, existing approaches are susceptible to outliers
and do not take into account variance induced by non-uniform data density and
in most cases require manual tuning of many parameters. In this paper, we
present a Bayesian machine learning approach that jointly optimizes the model
with respect to both the predictive mean and variance we refer to as Gaussian
processes for photometric redshifts (GPz). The predictive variance of the model
takes into account both the variance due to data density and photometric noise.
Using the SDSS DR12 data, we show that our approach substantially outperforms
other machine learning methods for photo-z estimation and their associated
variance, such as TPZ and ANNz2. We provide a Matlab and Python implementations

nano-scatterers that manipulate phase and polarization of optical waves with
subwavelength spatial resolution, enabling ultra-thin components for free-space
optics. While high performance devices with various functionalities, including
some that are difficult to achieve using conventional optical setups have been
shown, most demonstrated components have a fixed functionality. Here we
demonstrate highly tunable metasurface devices based on subwavelength thick
silicon nano-posts encapsulated in a thin transparent elastic polymer. As proof
of concept, we demonstrate a metasurface microlens operating at 915 nm, with
focal distance tuning from 600 $\mu$m to 1400 $\mu$m through radial strain,
while maintaining a diffraction limited focus and a focusing efficiency above
50$\%$. The demonstrated tunable metasurface concept is highly versatile for
developing ultra-slim, multi-functional and tunable optical devices with
widespread applications ranging from consumer electronics to medical devices

of the diffusion process when the characteristic exponent $\gamma$ is varied.
Crossover effects are also found at the level of the survival probability and
of the moments of the first passage-time distribution with two different
regimes separated by the critical value $\gamma=1/2$. The case of an
exponential scale factor is analyzed separately both for expanding and

organizational principles in social networks. With the increasing power of
social media platforms, when detecting communities there are two possi- ble
sources of information one can use: the structure of social network and node
attributes. However structure of social networks and node attributes are often
interpreted separately in the research of community detection. When these two
sources are interpreted simultaneously, one common as- sumption shared by
previous studies is that nodes attributes are correlated with communities. In
this paper, we present a model that is capable of combining topology
information and nodes attributes information with- out assuming correlation.
This new model can recover communities with higher accuracy even when node
attributes and communities are uncorre- lated. We derive the detectability
threshold for this model and use Belief Propagation (BP) to make inference.
This algorithm is optimal in the sense that it can recover community all the
way down to the threshold. This new model is also with the potential to handle

quite general phenomenon: among the alkali and alkaline earth metals, Na and Mg

this with quantum mechanics calculations for a wide range of substrate

cold atoms in optical lattices, where the heat bath is replaced by the laser
beams of the lattice. We investigate in detail the stationary phase-space
probability for Sisyphus cooling under harmonic confinement. In particular, we
elucidate whether the total energy of the system still describes its stationary
state statistics. We find that this is true for the center part of the
phase-space density for deep lattices, where the Boltzmann-Gibbs density
provides an approximate description. The relation between energy and statistics
also persists for strong confinement and in the limit of high energies, where
the system becomes underdamped. However, the phase-space density now exhibits
heavy power-law tails. In all three cases we find expressions for the leading
order phase-space density and corrections which break the equivalence of
probability and energy and violate energy equipartition. The non-equilibrium
nature of the steady state is confounded by explicit violations of detailed
balance. We complement these analytical results with numerical simulations to
map out the intricate structure of the phase-space density.

half-filling, ferromagnetic order emerges as the dominant magnetic pattern
along the rungs of the ladder, and antiferromagnetic order along the legs, in
excellent agreement with neutron experiments; (ii) pairs form in the strong
coupling regime, as found by studying the binding energy of two holes doped on
the half-filled system. In addition, Orbital Selective Mott Phase
characteristics develop with doping, with only one Wannier orbital receiving
the hole carriers while the other remains half-filled. These results suggest
that the analysis of models for iron-based two-leg ladders could clarify the
origin of pairing tendencies and other exotic properties of iron-based high

Kronecker product with low rank factors, providing robustness and reducing the

line profile consists of two components. The quiescent main component has a
small linewidth of 0.3 km s$^{-1}$ dominated by thermal motions, and the
red-shifted wing component has a large linewidth of 1.36 km s$^{-1}$
representing turbulent motions. These components show kinetic temperatures of
11 K and $<$ 30 K, respectively. Furthermore, there is a clear velocity offset
between the NH$_3$ quiescent gas ($VLSR=3.7$ km s$^{-1}$) and the turbulent gas
($VLSR=4.4$ km s$^{-1}$). The centroid velocity of the turbulent gas
corresponds to that of the surrounding gas traced by the $^{13}$CO ($J=1-0$)

clustering results provide supervisory signals to representation learning. By
integrating two processes into a single model with a unified weighted triplet

state in a spin-1/2 qubit system on a square lattice. First, we show that
switching ON/OFF the Heisenberg and $XY$ interactions produces the chiral
interaction directly in the effective Hamiltonian without controlling local

prepared, we prove that the chirality with desirable phase is dynamically
obtained. Finally, even for the case where switching ON/OFF the interactions is

spectra were obtained with the Cosmic Origins Spectrograph (COS) of the Hubble
Space Telescope. The bolometric thermal emission, $L_{bol}$, associated with
the accretion flow is a large fraction of the Eddington limit for all of these
sources. We estimate the long term time averaged jet power, $\overline{Q}$, for
the three sources. $\overline{Q}/L_{bol}$, is shown to lie along the
correlation of $\overline{Q}/L_{bol}$ and $\alpha_{EUV}$ found in previous
studies of the EUV continuum of intermediate and high redshift quasars, where
the EUV continuum flux density between 1100 \AA\, and 700 \AA\, is defined by
$F_{\nu} \sim \nu^{-\alpha_{EUV}}$. The high Eddington ratios of the three
quasars extends the analysis into a wider parameter space. Selecting quasars
with high Eddington ratios has accentuated the statistical significance of the
partial correlation analysis of the data. Namely. the correlation of
$\overline{Q}/L_{\mathrm{bol}}$ and $\alpha_{EUV}$ is fundamental and the
correlation of $\overline{Q}$ and $\alpha_{EUV}$ is spurious at a very high
statistical significance level (99.8\%). This supports the regulating role of
ram pressure of the accretion flow in magnetically arrested accretion models of

sharing is assumed where the Secondary User (SU) can access the Primary User
(PU) channel in two modes, underlay mode or cooperative mode with admission
control. In addition to access the channel in the overlay mode, secondary user
is allowed to occupy the channel currently occupied by the primary user but
with small transmission power. Adding the underlay access modes attains more
opportunities to the secondary user to transmit data. It is proposed that the
secondary user can only exploits the underlay access when the channel of the
primary user direct link is good or predicted to be in non-outage state.
Therefore, the secondary user could switch between underlay spectrum sharing
and cooperation with the primary user. Hybrid access is regulated through
monitoring the state of the primary link. By observing the simulation results,
the proposed model attains noticeable improvement in the system performance in

  covariance matrix based on high-frequency noisy observations","arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:1409.2121",,,,"math.ST stat.TH","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In practice, observations are often contaminated by noise, making the
resulting sample covariance matrix a signal-plus-noise sample covariance
matrix. Aiming to make inferences about the spectral distribution of the
population covariance matrix under such a situation, we establish an asymptotic
relationship that describes how the limiting spectral distribution of (signal)
sample covariance matrices depends on that of signal-plus-noise-type sample
covariance matrices. As an application, we consider inferences about the
spectral distribution of integrated covolatility (ICV) matrices of
high-dimensional diffusion processes based on high-frequency data with
microstructure noise. The (slightly modified) pre-averaging estimator is a
signal-plus-noise sample covariance matrix, and the aforementioned result,
together with a (generalized) connection between the spectral distribution of
signal sample covariance matrices and that of the population covariance matrix,
enables us to propose a two-step procedure to consistently estimate the
spectral distribution of ICV for a class of diffusion processes. An alternative
approach is further proposed, which possesses several desirable properties: it
is more robust, it eliminates the effects of microstructure noise, and the
asymptotic relationship that enables consistent estimation of the spectral
distribution of ICV is the standard Marcenko-Pastur equation. The performance
of the two approaches is examined via simulation studies under both synchronous
and asynchronous observation settings.

  paper to appear in Programming Language Design and Implementation (PLDI 2016)",,,,"cs.PL","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Dynamic languages such as Ruby, Python, and JavaScript have many compelling
benefits, but the lack of static types means subtle errors can remain latent in
code for a long time. While many researchers have developed various systems to
bring some of the benefits of static types to dynamic languages, prior
approaches have trouble dealing with metaprogramming, which generates code as
the program executes. In this paper, we propose Hummingbird, a new system that
uses a novel technique, just-in-time static type checking, to type check Ruby
code even in the presence of metaprogramming. In Hummingbird, method type
signatures are gathered dynamically at run-time, as those methods are created.
When a method is called, Hummingbird statically type checks the method body
against current type signatures. Thus, Hummingbird provides thorough static
checks on a per-method basis, while also allowing arbitrarily complex
metaprogramming. For performance, Hummingbird memoizes the static type checking
pass, invalidating cached checks only if necessary. We formalize Hummingbird
using a core, Ruby-like language and prove it sound. To evaluate Hummingbird,
we applied it to six apps, including three that use Ruby on Rails, a powerful
framework that relies heavily on metaprogramming. We found that all apps
typecheck successfully using Hummingbird, and that Hummingbird's performance
overhead is reasonable. We applied Hummingbird to earlier versions of one Rails
app and found several type errors that had been introduced and then fixed.
Lastly, we demonstrate using Hummingbird in Rails development mode to typecheck
an app as live updates are applied to it.

first, they are robust against skewed, heterogeneous, heavy-tailed errors or
outliers; second, they are robust against misspecification of the baseline

galaxies, based on the Miyamoto-Nagai (MN) disc. By using three sets of such
discs, each one of them aligned along each symmetry axis, we are able to
reconstruct a broad range of potentials that correspond to density profiles
from exponential discs to 3D power law models with varying triaxiality
(henceforth simply ""twisted"" models). We increase the efficiency of our
expansion by allowing the scale length parameter of each disc to be negative.
We show that, for suitable priors on the scale length and height parameters,
these ""MNn discs"" have just one negative density minimum. This allows us to
ensure global positivity by demanding that the total density at the global
minimum is positive. We find that at better than 10\% accuracy in our density
reconstruction, we can represent a radial and vertical exponential disc over
$0.1-10$ scale lengths/heights with 4 MNn discs, an NFW profile over $0.1-10$
scale lengths with 4 MNn discs, and a twisted triaxial NFW profile with 3 MNn
discs per symmetry axis. Our expansion is efficient, fully analytic, and
well-suited to reproducing the density distribution and gravitational potential

Condensation is prescribed to occur whenever the moisture at a point exceeds a
prescribed saturation value. It is seen that a slow condensation time scale is
required to obtain a consistent set of equations at leading order. Further,
since the advecting wind fields are geostrophic, changes in moisture (and
hence, precipitation) occur only via non-divergent mechanisms. Following
observations, a saturation profile with gradients in the zonal and meridional
directions is prescribed. A purely meridional gradient has the effect of
slowing down the dry Rossby waves, through a reduction in the ""equivalent
gradient"" of the background potential vorticity. A large scale unstable moist
mode results on the inclusion of a zonal gradient by itself, or in conjunction
with a meridional moisture gradient. For gradients that are are representative
of the atmosphere, the most unstable moist mode propagates zonally in the
direction of increasing moisture, matures over an intraseasonal timescale and
has small phase speed.

  Connection",,,,,"cs.DS cs.DM","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We revisit the classic problem of estimating the degree distribution moments
of an undirected graph. Consider an undirected graph $G=(V,E)$ with $n$
vertices, and define (for $s > 0$) $\mu_s = \frac{1}{n}\cdot\sum_{v \in V}
d^s_v$. Our aim is to estimate $\mu_s$ within a multiplicative error of
$(1+\epsilon)$ (for a given approximation parameter $\epsilon>0$) in sublinear
time. We consider the sparse graph model that allows access to: uniform random
vertices, queries for the degree of any vertex, and queries for a neighbor of
any vertex. For the case of $s=1$ (the average degree),
$\widetilde{O}(\sqrt{n})$ queries suffice for any constant $\epsilon$ (Feige,
SICOMP 06 and Goldreich-Ron, RSA 08). Gonen-Ron-Shavitt (SIDMA 11) extended
this result to all integral $s > 0$, by designing an algorithms that performs
$\widetilde{O}(n^{1-1/(s+1)})$ queries.
  We design a new, significantly simpler algorithm for this problem. In the
worst-case, it exactly matches the bounds of Gonen-Ron-Shavitt, and has a much
simpler proof. More importantly, the running time of this algorithm is
connected to the degeneracy of $G$. This is (essentially) the maximum density
of an induced subgraph. For the family of graphs with degeneracy at most
$\alpha$, it has a query complexity of
$\widetilde{O}\left(\frac{n^{1-1/s}}{\mu^{1/s}_s} \Big(\alpha^{1/s} +
\min\{\alpha,\mu^{1/s}_s\}\Big)\right) =
\widetilde{O}(n^{1-1/s}\alpha/\mu^{1/s}_s)$. Thus, for the class of bounded
degeneracy graphs (which includes all minor closed families and preferential
attachment graphs), we can estimate the average degree in $\widetilde{O}(1)$
queries, and can estimate the variance of the degree distribution in
$\widetilde{O}(\sqrt{n})$ queries. This is a major improvement over the
previous worst-case bounds. Our key insight is in designing an estimator for
$\mu_s$ that has low variance when $G$ does not have large dense subgraphs.

by an optical, arc-like reflection nebula. V1331 Cyg is commonly considered to
be a candidate for an object that has undergone an FU-Ori (FUOR) the outbreak
in the past. This in turn could lead to a time-varying appearance of the dusty
arcs that may be revealed by multi-epoch imaging. In particular, a radial
colour analysis of the dust arcs can then be attempted to check whether radial
grain size distribution was modified by a previous FUOR wind. Second-epoch
imaging of V1331 Cyg was obtained by us in 2009 using the Hubble Space
Telescope (HST). By comparing this to archival HST data from 2000, we studied
the time evolution of the circumstellar nebulae. After a point spread function
subtraction using model point spread functions, we used customised routines to
perform a proper motion analysis. The nebula expansion was first derived by
deconvolving and correlating the two-epoch radial brightness profiles.
Additional data from other facilities TLS, UKIDSS, SPITZER, and HERSCHEL were
also incorporated to improve our understanding of the star in terms of
environment, viewing angle, bipolar outflow length, and the FUOR phenomenon.
The derived radial colour profiles do not indicate a spatial separation of the
dust grain sizes. The HERSCHEL 160 micron images show for the time thermal
emission from dust probably residing in the outer arc. By viewing V1331 Cyg
almost pole-on, the length of the bipolar outflow exceeds previous estimates by
far. The outer arc expansion timescale is consistent with the implantation time
of the CO torus, which supports the hypothesis of an outburst that occurred a
few thousand years ago. The azimuthal colour variation of the outer arc is
probably due to changes of the scattering angle, imposed by a tilt or helical
geometry of the dust configuration.

effects analogous to those produced by a magnetic field; thus, there is a risk
that the effects of local rotation in the QGP might be mistaken for those of
the large genuine magnetic fields which are also known to arise in these

indeed that, with realistic parameter values, local rotation has effects on the
QGP (at high values of the baryonic chemical potential) which are not only of
the same kind as those produced by magnetic fields, but which can in fact be
substantially larger. Furthermore, the combined effect of rotation and
magnetism is to change the shape of the main quark matter phase transition line
in an interesting way, reducing the magnitude of its curvature; again, local
rotation contributes to this phenomenon at least as strongly as magnetism.

benefits: (i) interaction with the environment creates a rich sensory signal
that would otherwise not be present and (ii) knowledge of the regularity in the
combined space of sensory data and action parameters facilitate the prediction
and interpretation of the signal. In this survey we postulate this as a
principle and collect evidence in support by analyzing and categorizing
existing work in this area. We also provide an overview of the most important
applications of Interactive Perception. We close this survey by discussing
remaining open questions. Thereby, we hope to define a field and inspire future
work.

probabilistic approach to study the occurrence of large failures in a stylized

initially meet the load demands imposed on the network. Every single line
failure changes the load distribution in the surviving network, possibly
causing further lines to become overloaded and trip as well. An initial single
line failure can therefore potentially trigger massive cascading effects, and
in this paper we measure the risk of such cascading events by the probability
that the number of failed lines exceeds a certain large threshold. Under
particular critical conditions, the exceedance probability follows a power-law
distribution, implying a significant risk of severe failures. We examine the
robustness of the power-law behavior by exploring under which assumptions this

planetesimals from which the solar system condensed. Knowing their structure
and composition is thus crucial for the understanding of our origins. After the
successful landing of Philae on the nucleus of 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko in
November 2014, for the first time, the Rosetta mission provided the opportunity
to measure the low frequency electrical properties of a cometary mantle with
the permittivity probe SESAME-PP (Surface Electric Sounding and Acoustic
Monitoring Experiment - Permittivity Probe).
  Aims. In this paper, we conduct an in-depth analysis of the data from active
measurements collected by SESAME-PP at Abydos, which is the final landing site
of Philae, to constrain the porosity and, to a lesser extent, the composition
of the surface material down to a depth of about 1 meter.
  Methods. SESAME-PP observations on the surface are then analyzed by
comparison with data acquired during the descent toward the nucleus and with
numerical simulations that explore different possible attitudes and
environments of Philae at Abydos using a method called the Capacity-Influence
Matrix Method.
  Results. Reasonably assuming that the two receiving electrode channels have
not drifted with respect to each other during the ten-year journey of the
Rosetta probe to the comet, we constrain the dielectric constant of the first
meter below the surface at Abydos to be > 2.45 p/m 0.20, which is consistent
with a porosity < 50% if the dust phase is analogous to carbonaceous chondrites
and < 75% in the case of less primitive ordinary chondrites. This indicates
that the near surface of the nucleus of 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko nucleus is
more compacted than its interior and suggests that it could consist of a
sintered dust-ice layer.

Photodetection events of the shutter cavity output herald preparation of a
single photon in the memory cavity, which may be stored by immediately changing
the optical length of the shutter cavity with the EOM after detection.
On-demand readout of the photon, with arbitrary shaping, can be achieved
through modulation of the EOM. The second scheme consists of a memory cavity
with two outputs which are interfered, phase shifted, and measured. States that
closely approximate a coherent state superposition can be produced through
postselection for sequences of detection events, with more photon detection
events leading to a larger superposition. We furthermore demonstrate that
`No-Knowledge Feedback' can be easily implemented in this system and used to
preserve the superposition state, as well as provide an extra control mechanism

unpressurized, spherical elastic shell. Previous analyses of this classic
problem have assumed that for sufficiently large indentation depths, such a
shell deforms by `mirror buckling' --- a portion of the shell inverts to become
a spherical cap with equal but opposite curvature to the undeformed shell. The
energy of deformation is then localized in a ridge in which the deformed and
undeformed portions of the shell join together, commonly referred to as
Pogorelov's ridge. Rather than using an energy formulation, we revisit this
problem from the point of view of the shallow shell equations and perform an
asymptotic analysis that exploits the largeness of the indentation depth. This
reveals first that the stress profile associated with mirror buckling is
singular as the indenter is approached. This consequence of point indentation
means that mirror buckling must be modified to incorporate the shell's bending
stiffness close to the indenter and gives rise to an intricate asymptotic
structure with seven different spatial regions. This is in contrast with the
three regions (mirror-buckled, ridge and undeformed) that are usually assumed
and yields new insight into the large compressive hoop stress that ultimately
causes the shell to buckle azimuthally.

from human activity videos. We consider the problem in the context of
human-robot interaction: Our approach learns structural representations of
human-human (and human-object-human) interactions, describing how body-parts of
each agent move with respect to each other and what spatial relations they
should maintain to complete each sub-event (i.e., sub-goal). This enables the
robot to infer its own movement in reaction to the human body motion, allowing
it to naturally replicate such interactions.
  We introduce the representation of social affordance and propose a generative
model for its weakly supervised learning from human demonstration videos. Our
approach discovers critical steps (i.e., latent sub-events) in an interaction
and the typical motion associated with them, learning what body-parts should be
involved and how. The experimental results demonstrate that our Markov Chain
Monte Carlo (MCMC) based learning algorithm automatically discovers
semantically meaningful interactive affordance from RGB-D videos, which allows
us to generate appropriate full body motion for an agent.

pilot design to reliably estimate and feed back the downlink channel state

non-orthogonal downlink pilot design is first proposed, which is very different
from standard orthogonal pilots. By exploiting the spatially common sparsity of
massive MIMO channels, a compressive sensing (CS) based adaptive CSI
acquisition scheme is proposed, where the consumed time slot overhead only
adaptively depends on the sparsity level of the channels. Additionally, a
distributed sparsity adaptive matching pursuit algorithm is proposed to jointly
estimate the channels of multiple subcarriers. Furthermore, by exploiting the
temporal channel correlation, a closed-loop channel tracking scheme is
provided, which adaptively designs the non-orthogonal pilot according to the
previous channel estimation to achieve an enhanced CSI acquisition. Finally, we
generalize the results of the multiple-measurement-vectors case in CS and
derive the Cramer-Rao lower bound of the proposed scheme, which enlightens us
to design the non-orthogonal pilot signals for the improved performance.
Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed scheme outperforms its
counterparts, and it is capable of approaching the performance bound.

find that crossing points in the diamond structure are revealed as minima due

quantum interference gives rise to sharp peaks in the thermoelectric
conductance. Remarkably, we find interaction induced strong current
nonlinearities for large thermal gradients that may lead to several nontrivial
zeros in the thermocurrent. The latter property is especially attractive for
thermoelectric applications.

and Mattila to construct an atomic martingale filtration of
$\mathrm{supp}(\mu)$ which provides the right framework for a dyadic form of
nondoubling harmonic analysis. Despite this filtration being highly irregular,
its atoms are comparable to balls in the given metric |which in turn are all
doubling| and satisfy a weaker but crucial form of regularity. Our dyadic
formulation is effective to address three basic questions:
  i) A dyadic form of Tolsa's RBMO space which contains it.
  ii) Lerner's domination and $A_2$-type bounds for nondoubling measures.
  iii) A noncommutative form of nonhomogeneous Calder\'on-Zygmund theory.
  Our martingale RBMO space preserves the crucial properties of Tolsa's
original definition and reveals its interpolation behavior with the $L_p$ scale
in the category of Banach spaces, unknown so far. On the other hand, due to
some known obstructions for Haar shifts and related concepts over nondoubling
measures, our pointwise domination theorem via sparsity naturally deviates from
its doubling analogue. In a different direction, matrix-valued harmonic
analysis over noncommutative $L_p$ spaces has recently produced profound
applications. Our analogue for nondoubling measures was expected for quite some
time. Finally, we also find a dyadic form of the Calder\'on-Zygmund
decomposition which unifies those by Tolsa and
L\'opez-S\'anchez/Martell/Parcet.

implement containment measures such as public vaccination at a macroscopic
level. Meanwhile, individuals tend to protect themselves by avoiding contacts
with infections at a microscopic level. However, a comprehensive understanding
of how such combined strategy influences epidemic dynamics is still lacking. We
study a susceptible-infected-susceptible epidemic model with imperfect
vaccination on dynamic contact networks, where the macroscopic intervention is
represented by random vaccination of the population and the microscopic
protection is characterised by susceptible individuals rewiring contacts from
infective neighbours. In particular, the model is formulated both in
populations without and then with demographic effects. Using the pairwise
approximation and the probability generating function approach, we investigate
both dynamics of the epidemic and the underlying network. For populations
without demography, the emerging degree correlations, bistable states, and
oscillations demonstrate the combined effects of the public vaccination program
and individual protective behavior. Compared to either strategy in isolation,
the combination of public vaccination and individual protection is more
effective in preventing and controlling the spread of infectious diseases by
increasing both the invasion threshold and the persistence threshold. For
populations with additional demographic factors, the integration between
vaccination intervention and individual rewiring may promote epidemic spreading
due to the birth effect. Moreover, the degree distributions of both networks in

shift in energy, commonly referred to as the line isotope shift. One of the
components of the isotope shift is the field shift, which depends on the extent
and the shape of the nuclear charge density distribution. Purpose: To
investigate how sensitive field shifts are with respect to variations in the
nuclear size and shape and what information of nuclear charge distributions
that can be extracted from measured field shifts. Methods: Nuclear properties
are obtained from nuclear density functional theory calculations based on the
Skyrme-Hartree-Fock-Bogoliubov approach. These results are combined with
multiconfiguration Dirac-Hartree-Fock methods to obtain realistic field shifts.
Results: Phenomena such as nuclear deformation and variations in the
diffuseness of nuclear charge distributions give measurable contributions to
the field shifts. Using a novel approach, we demonstrate the possibility to
extract new information concerning the nuclear charge densities from the
observed field shifts. Conclusions: Combining methods used in atomic and
nuclear structure theory gives an improved description of field shifts.
Extracting additional nuclear information from measured field shifts is
possible in the near future with improved experimental methods.

in a Bayesian framework. We target model order and parameter estimation via
variational inference in a probabilistic model in which the frequencies are
continuous-valued, i.e., not restricted to a grid; and the coefficients are
governed by a Bernoulli-Gaussian prior model turning model order selection into
binary sequence detection. Unlike earlier works which retain only point
estimates of the frequencies, we undertake a more complete Bayesian treatment
by estimating the posterior probability density functions (pdfs) of the
frequencies and computing expectations over them. Thus, we additionally capture
and operate with the uncertainty of the frequency estimates. Aiming to maximize
the model evidence, variational optimization provides analytic approximations
of the posterior pdfs and also gives estimates of the additional parameters. We
propose an accurate representation of the pdfs of the frequencies by mixtures
of von Mises pdfs, which yields closed-form expectations. We define the
algorithm VALSE in which the estimates of the pdfs and parameters are
iteratively updated. VALSE is a gridless, convergent method, does not require
parameter tuning, can easily include prior knowledge about the frequencies and
provides approximate posterior pdfs based on which the uncertainty in line
spectral estimation can be quantified. Simulation results show that accounting
for the uncertainty of frequency estimates, rather than computing just point
estimates, significantly improves the performance. The performance of VALSE is
superior to that of state-of-the-art methods and closely approaches the
Cram\'er-Rao bound computed for the true model order.

Sun at disc-centre in the visible wavelength range. Both datasets serve as
fundamental resources for many researchers, in particular for chemical
abundance analysis. But despite their similar published specifications
(spectral resolution, noise level), the shapes of spectral lines in the two
atlases differ significantly and systematically.
  Aims: Knowledge of any instrumental degradations is imperative to fully
exploit the information content of spectroscopic data. We seek to investigate
the magnitude---and to explain the possible sources---of these differences. We
provide the wavelength-dependent correction parameters that need to be taken
into account when the spectra are to be compared with e.g. synthetic data.
  Methods: A parametrically degraded version of the Hamburg spectrum is fitted
to the Li\`ege spectrum. The parameters of the model (wavelength shift,
broadening, intensity scaling, intensity offset) represent the different
characteristics of the respective instruments, observational strategies and
data processing.
  Results: The wavelength scales of the Li\`ege and Hamburg atlases differ on
average by 0.5 m{\AA} with a standard deviation of $\pm$2 m{\AA}, except for a
peculiar region around 5500 {\AA}. The continuum levels are offset by up to 18%
below 5000 {\AA} but stably at a 0.8% difference towards the red. We find no
evidence for spectral straylight in the Li\`ege spectrum. Its resolving power
is almost independent of wavelength but limited to about 216000, between two to
six times less than specified. When accounting for the degradations determined
in this work, the spectra of the two atlases agree within a few parts in

ubiquitous and already has made its way into commercial products. Yet,
capturing the geometry or complete shapes of everyday objects using scanning

learn complex shape distributions in a data-driven way from large scale 3D CAD
Model collections and to utilize them for 3D processing on volumetric
representations and thereby circumventing problems of topology and
tessellation. Prior work has shown encouraging results on problems ranging from
shape completion to recognition. We provide an analysis of such approaches and
discover that training as well as the resulting representation are strongly and
unnecessarily tied to the notion of object labels. Thus, we propose a full
convolutional volumetric auto encoder that learns volumetric representation
from noisy data by estimating the voxel occupancy grids. The proposed method
outperforms prior work on challenging tasks like denoising and shape
completion. We also show that the obtained deep embedding gives competitive
performance when used for classification and promising results for shape

have been extracted for the first time. As a consequence, the branching
fractions of all the $D\to VP$ decays are predicted, especially those modes
that could not be predicted previously due to the unknown $A_{P,V}$. Our
working assumption, the flavor SU(3) symmetry, is tested by comparing our

modes based on the flavor amplitudes extracted from the Cabibbo-favored decays
using the current data. The predictions for the doubly Cabibbo-suppressed

and alleviate the spectrum scarcity, by allowing unlicensed secondary users
(SUs) to access the licensed spectrum of primary users (PUs) opportunistically.
Cooperative spectrum sharing is a new promising paradigm to provide necessary
incentives for both PUs and SUs in dynamic spectrum access. The key idea is
that SUs relay the traffic of PUs in exchange for the access time on the PUs'
licensed spectrum. In this paper, we formulate the cooperative spectrum sharing
between multiple PUs and multiple SUs as a two-sided market, and study the
market equilibrium under both complete and incomplete information. First, we
characterize the sufficient and necessary conditions for the market
equilibrium. We analytically show that there may exist multiple market
equilibria, among which there is always a unique Pareto-optimal equilibrium for
PUs (called PU-Optimal-EQ), in which every PU achieves a utility no worse than
in any other equilibrium. Then, we show that under complete information, the
unique Pareto-optimal equilibrium PU-Optimal-EQ can always be achieved despite
the competition among PUs; whereas, under incomplete information, the
PU-Optimal-EQ may not be achieved due to the mis-representations of SUs (in
reporting their private information). Regarding this, we further study the
worse-case equilibrium for PUs, and characterize a Robust equilibrium for PUs
(called PU-Robust-EQ), which provides every PU a guaranteed utility under all
possible mis-representation behaviors of SUs. Numerical results show that in a
typical network where the number of PUs and SUs are different, the performance
gap between PU-Optimal-EQ and PU-Robust-EQ is quite small (e.g., less than 10%
in the simulations).

investigated using face-shear d24 PZT wafers as both actuators and sensors.
Results show that pure SH0 wave can be excited symmetrically along two

strong ($\gtrsim 10$ Jy) 22 GHz megamaser emission, and VLBI observations have
shown that the masers reside in the innermost $\sim 1$ parsec of the galaxies.
The peak flux densities of the 321 GHz masers in both systems are substantially
weaker (by a factor of $\sim$100) than what is observed at 22 GHz, though the
corresponding isotropic luminosities are more closely matched (within a factor
of $\sim$10) between the two transitions. We compare the submillimeter spectra
presented here to the known 22 GHz spectra in both galaxies, and we argue that
while both transitions originate from the gaseous environment near the AGN, not
all sites are necessarily in common. In Circinus, the spectral structure of the

interior to the 22 GHz masers. The continuum emission in NGC 4945 and NGC 5793

exo-planetary systems in order to provide valuable theoretical data required to
interpret observations of gas and dust. We use a quasi 3D model of cometary
nucleus to study the thermo-physical evolution of comets evolving around a
single star from 0.1 to 50 AU, whose homogeneous luminosity varies from 0.1 to
70 solar luminosities. This paper provides mass ejection, lifetimes, and the
rate of dust and water gas mass productions for comets as a function of the
distance to the star and stellar luminosity. Results show significant physical
changes to comets at high stellar luminosities. The models are presented in
such a manner that they can be readily applied to any planetary system. By
considering the examples of the Solar System, Vega and HD 69830, we show that
dust grains released from sublimating comets have the potential to create the
observed (exo)zodiacal emission. We show that observations can be reproduced by
1 to 2 massive comets or by a large number of comets whose orbits approach
close to the star. Our conclusions depend on the stellar luminosity and the
uncertain lifetime of the dust grains. We find, as in previous studies, that
exozodiacal dust disks can only survive if replenished by a population of
typically sized comets renewed from a large and cold reservoir of cometary
bodies beyond the water ice line. These comets could reach the inner regions of
the planetary system following scattering by a (giant) planet.

under homotopy equivalence. This has shortcomings: for example, it is believed
that it is impossible to define a type of semi-simplicial types. More
generally, it is difficult and often impossible to handle towers of coherences.
To address this, we propose a 2-level theory which features both strict and
weak equality. This can essentially be represented as two type theories: an
""outer"" one, containing a strict equality type former, and an ""inner"" one,
which is some version of HoTT. Our type theory is inspired by Voevosky's
suggestion of a homotopy type system (HTS) which currently refers to a range of
ideas. A core insight of our proposal is that we no not need any form of
equality reflection in order to achieve what HTS was suggested for. Instead,
having unique identity proofs in the outer type theory is sufficient, and it
also has the meta-theoretical advantage of not breaking decidability of type
checking. The inner theory can be an easily justifiable extensions of HoTT,
allowing the construction of ""infinite structures"" which are considered
impossible in plain HoTT. Alternatively, we can set the inner theory to be
exactly the current standard formulation of HoTT, in which case our system can
be thought of as a type-theoretic framework for working with ""schematic""
definitions in HoTT. As demonstrations, we define semi-simplicial types and
formalise constructions of Reedy fibrant diagrams.

envelope of protostar L1527, we have reconstructed its morphology and
kinematics under the assumption of axisymmetry about the west-east axis. The
main original contribution to our understanding of the formation process of
L1527 is the presentation of a simple 3D parameterisation based solely on
regions that are not dominated by absorption. In the explored range ($\sim$0.7
to 5 arcsec from the star) the model reproduces observations better than
earlier attempts. The main results include: a measurement of the rotation
velocity that confirms its evolution to Keplerian toward short distances; a
measurement of the mean in-fall velocity, 0.43$\pm$0.10 kms$^{-1}$, lower than
free fall velocity, with no evidence for the significant $r$-dependence
suggested by an earlier analysis; a measurement of the central mass,
0.23$\pm$0.06 M$_{\odot}$ within a distance of 1.5 arcsec from the star, in
agreement with earlier estimates obtained from a different range of distances;
evidence for a strong disc plane depression of the in-falling flux resulting in
an $X$ shaped flow possibly caused by the freeze-out of CO molecules on dust
grains; a measurement of the accretion rate, 3.5$\pm$1.0 10$^{-7}$
M$_{\odot}$yr$^{-1}$ at a distance of 1 arcsec (140 au) from the star; evidence
for a 10$^\circ$ tilt of the symmetry plane of the envelope about the line of
sight, cancelling below $\sim$3 arcsec from the star, but matching infrared
observations and being also apparent on the sky map of the mean Doppler
velocity.

  efficiency",,,,,"stat.CO stat.ME","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Alphabetic optimality criteria, such as the $D$, $A$, and $I$ criteria,
require specifying a model to select optimal designs. They are not model free
and the optimal designs selected by them are not robust to model uncertainty.
Recently, many extensions of the $D$ and $A$ criteria have been proposed for
selecting robust designs with high estimation efficiency. However, approaches
for finding robust designs with high prediction efficiency are rarely studied
in the literature. In this paper, we propose the $P_\alpha$ criterion and
develop its approximation version for two-level designs, called the ${\tilde
P_\alpha}$ criterion. They are useful for selecting robust designs with high
estimation, high prediction, or balanced estimation and prediction efficiency
for projective submodels. Computational studies show that the ${\tilde
P}_\alpha$ criterion is a good approximation of the $P_\alpha$ criterion and
can reduce great computation time when we search designs over a wide range of
models. The connection between the ${\tilde P_\alpha}$ criterion and the
generalized minimum aberration (GMA) criterion is studied. Result shows that
${\tilde P_\alpha}$ plays a great role to link the alphabetic optimality
criteria and the aberration-based criteria.

hard brittle reinforcement phase embedded in a soft ductile matrix. It
addresses the full three-dimensional nature of the microstructure and
macroscopic deformation. A large ensemble of periodic microstructures is used,
whereby the individual grains of the two phases are modeled using equi-sized
cubes. A particular solution strategy relying on the Fast Fourier Transform is
adopted, which has a high computational efficiency both in terms of speed and
memory footprint, thus enabling a statistically meaningful analysis. This
solution method naturally accompanies the regular microstructural model, as the
Fast Fourier Transform relies on a regular grid.
  Using the many considered microstructures as an ensemble, the average
arrangement of phases around fracture initiation sites is objectively
identified by the correlation between microstructure and fracture initiation --
in three dimensions. The results show that fracture initiates where regions of
the hard phase are interrupted by bands of the soft phase that are aligned with
the direction of maximum shear. In such regions, the hard phase is arranged
such that the area of the phase boundary perpendicular to the principal strain
direction is maximum, leading to high hydrostatic tensile stresses, while not
interrupting the shear bands that form in the soft phase. The local
incompatibility that is present around the shear bands is responsible for a
high plastic strain. By comparing the response to a two-dimensional
microstructure it is observed that the response is qualitatively similar (both
macroscopically and microscopically). One important difference is that the
local strain partitioning between the two phases is over-predicted by the
two-dimensional microstructure, leading to an overestimation of damage.

spacetime description in loop quantum cosmology. We find that even though the
spacetime curvature vanishes at the classical level, non-trivial quantum
gravitational effects can arise. For the standard loop quantization of
Bianchi-I spacetime, which uniquely yields universal bounds on expansion and
shear scalars and results in a generic resolution of strong singularities, we
find that a flat Kasner metric is not a physical solution of the effective
spacetime description, except in a limit. The lack of a flat Kasner metric at
the quantum level results from a novel feature of the loop quantum Bianchi-I
spacetime: quantum geometry induces non-vanishing spacetime curvature
components, making it not Ricci flat even when no matter is present. The
non-curvature singularity of the classical flat Kasner spacetime is avoided,
and the effective spacetime transits from a flat Kasner spacetime in asymptotic
future, to a Minkowski spacetime in asymptotic past. Interestingly, for an
alternate loop quantization which does not share some of the fine features of
the standard quantization, flat Kasner spacetime with expected classical
features exists. In this case, even with non-trivial quantum geometric effects,
the spacetime curvature vanishes. These examples show that the character of
even a flat classical vacuum spacetime can alter in a fundamental way in
quantum gravity and is sensitive to the quantization procedure.

platform along with a classification algorithm to distinguish between human
intrusion, animal intrusion and clutter arising from wind-blown vegetative
movement in an outdoor environment. The research was aimed at exploring the
potential use of wireless sensor networks as an early-warning system to help
mitigate human-wildlife conflicts occurring at the edge of a forest. There are
three important features to the development. Firstly, the sensor platform
employs multiple sensors arranged in the form of a two-dimensional array to
give it a key spatial-resolution capability that aids in classification.
Secondly, given the challenges of collecting data involving animal intrusion,
an Animation-based Simulation tool for Passive Infra-Red sEnsor (ASPIRE) was
developed that simulates signals corresponding to human and animal intrusion
and some limited models of vegetative clutter. This speeded up the process of
algorithm development by allowing us to test different hypotheses in a
time-efficient manner. Finally, a chirplet-based model for intruder signal was
developed that significantly helped boost classification accuracy despite
drawing data from a smaller number of sensors. An SVM-based classifier was used
which made use of chirplet, energy and signal cross-correlation-based features.
The average accuracy obtained for intruder detection and classification on
real-world and simulated data sets was in excess of 97%.

The cavity is thus emptied as all transmission probabilities of the quantum
point contact approach one or zero. Two-photon processes are identified at
higher coupling, and pair absorption dominates over pair emission for all bias
voltages. As a result, the number of cavity photons, the cavity damping rate
and the second order coherence $g^{(2)}$ are all reduced and exhibit less

cases in 2015-6 in Brazil, however its role is unconfirmed despite individual
cases of viral infections found in neural tissue. Here we consider the
alternative that the insecticide pyriproxyfen, used in Brazilian drinking water
for mosquito control, may actually be the cause. Pyriproxifen is an analog of
juvenile hormone, which corresponds in mammals to regulatory molecules
including retinoic acid, a vitamin A metabolite, with which it has
cross-reactivity and whose application during development causes microcephaly.
Methoprene, another juvenile hormone analog approved as an insecticide has
metabolites that bind to the retinoid X receptor, and causes developmental
disorders in mammals. Isotretinoin is another example of a retinoid causing
microcephaly in human babies via activation of the retinoid X receptor.
Moreover, tests of pyriproxyfen by the manufacturer, Sumitomo, widely quoted as
giving no evidence for developmental toxicity, actually found some evidence for
such an effect, including low brain mass and arhinencephaly--incomplete
formation of the anterior cerebral hemispheres--in rat pups. Finally, the
pyriproxyfen use in Brazil is unprecedented--it has never before been applied
to a water supply on such a scale. Claims that it is not being used in Recife,
the epicenter of microcephaly cases, do not distinguish the metropolitan area
of Recife, where it is widely used, and the municipality, where it is not.
Given this combination of information we strongly recommend that the use of
pyriproxyfen in Brazil be suspended pending further investigation.

  Fluid dynamics is involved in a very wide range of astrophysical phenomena,

workings of jets and accretion discs around stars and black holes, and the
dynamics of the expanding Universe. Effects that can be important in
astrophysical fluids include compressibility, self-gravitation and the
dynamical influence of the magnetic field that is 'frozen in' to a highly
conducting plasma.
  The basic models introduced and applied in this course are Newtonian gas
dynamics and magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) for an ideal compressible fluid. The
mathematical structure of the governing equations and the associated
conservation laws are explored in some detail because of their importance for
both analytical and numerical methods of solution, as well as for physical
interpretation. Linear and nonlinear waves, including shocks and other
discontinuities, are discussed. The spherical blast wave resulting from a
supernova, and involving a strong shock, is a classic problem that can be
solved analytically. Steady solutions with spherical or axial symmetry reveal
the physics of winds and jets from stars and discs. The linearized equations
determine the oscillation modes of astrophysical bodies, as well as determining
their stability and their response to tidal forcing.

  Relativity","43 pages, LaTeX, 9 figures, 6 ancillary files",,,,"gr-qc math-ph math.MP","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  A modified theory of general relativity is proposed, where the gravitational
constant is replaced by a dynamical variable in space-time. The dynamics of the
gravitational coupling is described by a family of parametrized null geodesics,
implying that the gravitational coupling at a space-time point is determined by
solving transport equations along all null geodesics through this point.
  General relativity with dynamical gravitational coupling (DGC) is introduced.
We motivate DGC from general considerations and explain how it arises in the
context of causal fermion systems. The underlying physical idea is that the
gravitational coupling is determined by microscopic structures on the Planck
scale which propagate with the speed of light.
  In order to clarify the mathematical structure, we analyze the conformal
behavior and prove local existence and uniqueness of the time evolution. The
differences to Einstein's theory are worked out in the examples of the
Friedmann-Robertson-Walker model and the spherically symmetric collapse of a
shell of matter. Potential implications for the problem of dark matter and for
inflation are discussed. It is shown that the effects in the solar system are
too small for being observable in present-day experiments.

This paper examines the PT phase transition in mathematical models of

models is that a possible way to treat a serious disease in which the antigen
concentration is growing out of bounds (and the host will die) is to inject a
small dose of a second (different) antigen. In this case there are two possible
favorable outcomes. In the unbroken-PT-symmetric phase the disease becomes
chronic and is no longer lethal while in the appropriate broken-PT-symmetric

completely cured.

to an incorrect estimate of the large-scale imprint of IDE in the cosmic

customized medical implants, jet engine bearings, and rapid prototyping in the

they commonly rely on computer controlled melting or sintering of a metal alloy
powder using a laser or electron beam. The mechanical properties of parts
produced in such a way have been well studied, but little attention has been
paid to their electrical properties. Here we show that a microwave cavity
(resonant frequencies 9.9 and 11.2 GHz) 3D printed using an Al-12Si alloy
exhibits superconductivity when cooled below the critical temperature of
aluminium (1.2 K), with a performance comparable to the common 6061 alloy of
aluminium. Superconducting cavities find application in numerous areas of
physics, from particle accelerators to cavity quantum electrodynamics
experiments. The result is achieved even with a very large concentration of
non-superconducting silicon in the alloy of 12.18%, compared to Al-6061, which
has between 0.4 to 0.8%. Our results may pave the way for the possibility of 3D

backward masking is used to make stimuli (natural images) subjectively
invisible to subjects, however, the bottom-up saliency can still orient the
subjects attention. To measure this orientation/attention effect, we adopt the
cueing effect paradigm by deploying discrimination tasks at each location of an
image, and measure the discrimination performance variation across the image as
the attentional effect of the bottom-up saliency. Such attentional effects are
combined to construct a final bottomup saliency map. Based on the proposed
method, we introduce a new bottom-up saliency map dataset of natural images to
benchmark computational models. We compare several state-of-the-art saliency
models on the dataset. Moreover, the proposed paradigm is applied to
investigate the neural basis of the bottom-up visual saliency map by analyzing
psychophysical and fMRI experimental results. Our findings suggest that the
bottom-up saliency maps of natural images are constructed in V1. It provides a
strong scientific evidence to resolve the long standing dispute in neuroscience
