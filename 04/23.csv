are widely used in many areas of science and are routinely applied to alloy
thermodynamics, solid-solid phase transitions, magnetic and thermal properties
of solids, and fluid mechanics, among others. However, the problem of finding
the true global ground state of a lattice model, which is essential for all of
the aforementioned applications, has remained unresolved, with only a limited
number of results for highly simplified systems known. In this article, we
present the first general algorithm to find the exact ground states of complex
lattice models and to prove their global optimality, resolving this fundamental
problem in condensed matter and materials theory. We transform the
infinite-discrete-optimization problem into a pair of combinatorial
optimization (MAX-SAT) and non-smooth convex optimization (MAX-MIN) problems,
which provide upper and lower bounds on the ground state energy respectively.
By systematically converging these bounds to each other, we find and prove the
exact ground state of realistic Hamiltonians whose solutions are completely
intractable via traditional methods. Considering that currently such
Hamiltonians are solved using simulated annealing and genetic algorithms that
are often unable to find the true global energy minimum, and never able to
prove the optimality of their result, our work opens the door to resolving
long-standing uncertainties in lattice models of physical phenomena.

reached allows us to detect striking new features of the ordered magnetic
field. The nuclear outflow extends far into the halo to about 5\,kpc from the
center and is spatially correlated with the $\rm{H}\alpha$ and X-ray emission.
For the first time, the southern outflow is detected. Above and below both
spiral arms we find extended blobs of polarized emission with an ordered field
oriented perpendicular to the disk. The synchrotron lifetime of the cosmic ray
electrons (CREs) in these regions yields a mean outflow velocity of
$(270\pm70)\kms$, in agreement with a galactic wind scenario. The observed
symmetry of the polarized halo features in NGC 4388 excludes a compression of
the halo gas by the ram pressure of the intra-cluster medium (ICM). The
assumption of equilibrium between the halo pressure and the ICM ram pressure
yields an estimate of the ICM density that is consistent with both the ICM
density derived from X-ray observations and the recent \textit{Planck}
Sunyaev-Zel'dovich measurements. The detection of a faint radio halo around
cluster galaxies could thus be used for an estimate of ICM ram pressure.

exhibited good performance for relatively small n, there are potential problems

variable selection methods in high-dimensional datasets. A genetic algorithm
framework for variable selection with logistic regression models is used to
search for two-way interaction terms in a clinical dataset of adult ICU
patients, with separate models being built for each category of diagnosis upon
admittance to the ICU. The models had good discrimination across all
categories, with a weighted average AUC of 0.84 (>0.90 for several categories)
and the genetic algorithm was able to find several significant interaction
terms, which may be able to provide greater insight into mortality prediction
for health practitioners. The GA selected models had improved performance
against stepwise selection and random forest models, and provides greater

neutrino mixing need not be exactly maximal. Moreover, each of the two allowed

experimental parameters (genetic algorithm iterations, bin size, SLM active
area, target area, spot size, and sample angle with respect to the optical
axis) and optimizing the reflected light we determine how each parameter
affects the intensity enhancement. We find that the effects of the experimental
parameters on the enhancement are similar to those measured for a transmissive
geometry, but with the exact functional forms changed due to the different

  In this paper, we address these problems by introducing causal
linearizability, a correctness condition for concurrent objects running on weak
memory models. Like linearizability itself, causal linearizability enables
concurrent objects to be composed, under weak constraints on the client's
behaviour. We specify these constraints by introducing a notion of
operation-race freedom, where programs that satisfy this property are
guaranteed to behave as if their shared objects were in fact linearizable.

reachability checks for action trees. Action trees can be used to study the
behaviour of real-world concurrent programs. ATAB encodes pairwise reachability
checks into alternating tree automata that determine whether an action tree has
a schedule where any pair of given points in the program are simultaneously
reachable. Because the pairwise reachability problem is undecidable in general
ATAB operates under a restricted form of lock-based concurrency. ATAB produces
alternating tree automata that are more compact and more efficiently checkable
than those that have been previously used. The process is entirely automated,
which simplifies the process of encoding checks for more complex action trees.
The alternating tree automata produced are easier to scale to large numbers of
locks than previous constructions.

time-domain wavefield simulation problems. Our algorithm consists of two main
stages. During the first ""off-line"" stage the fine-grid operator (of the graph
Laplacian type} is partitioned on coarse cells (subdomains). Then
projection-type multi-scale reduced order models (ROMs) are computed for the
coarse cell operators. The off-line stage is embarrassingly parallel as ROM
computations for the subdomains are independent of each other. It also does not
depend on the number of simulated sources (inputs) and it is performed just
once before the entire time-domain simulation. At the second ""on-line"" stage
the time-domain simulation is performed within the obtained multi-scale ROM
framework. The crucial feature of our formulation is the representation of the
ROMs in terms of matrix Stieltjes continued fractions (S-fractions). The
layered structure of the S-fraction introduces several hidden layers in the ROM
representation, that results in the block-tridiagonal dynamic system within
each coarse cell. This allows us to sparsify the obtained multi-scale subdomain
operator ROMs and to reduce the communications between the adjacent subdomains
which is highly beneficial for a parallel implementation of the on-line stage.
Our approach suits perfectly the high performance computing architectures,
however in this paper we present rather promising numerical results for a
serial computing implementation only. These results include 3D acoustic and
multi-phase anisotropic elastic problems.

interplay between solvent quality, concentration, molecular weight, and flow
type. Semi-dilute solutions are characterized by large fluctuations in
concentration, wherein polymer coils interpenetrate but may not be
topologically entangled at equilibrium. In non-equilibrium flows, it is
generally thought that polymer chains can self-entangle in semi-dilute
solutions, thereby leading to entanglements in solutions that are nominally
unentangled at equilibrium. Despite recent progress, we still lack a complete
molecular-level understanding of these dynamics. In this work, we use single
molecule techniques to study the dynamics of semi-dilute solutions of DNA in
planar extensional flow, including polymer relaxation from high stretch,
transient stretching dynamics in step-strain experiments, and steady-state
stretching in flow. Our results are consistent with a power-law scaling of the
longest polymer relaxation time in semi-dilute solutions, revealing an
effective excluded volume exponent $\nu$ = 0.56. We further studied the
non-equilibrium stretching dynamics in extensional flow, with results showing a
decrease in transient polymer stretch at moderate Weissenberg number and a
milder coil-to-stretch transition in semi-dilute solutions compared to dilute
solutions. Interestingly, a unique set of molecular conformations during the
transient stretching process for single polymers in semi-dilute solutions is
observed, which suggests transient stretching pathways for polymer chains in
semi-dilute solutions are qualitatively different than dilute solutions due to
intermolecular interactions. Taken together, this work provides a molecular
framework for understanding the non-equilibrium stretching dynamics of
semi-dilute solutions in strong flows.

Keck Interferometer Nuller and near-contemporaneous spectro-photometry from the
IRTF of 11 well known young stellar objects, several observed for the first
time in these spectral and spatial resolution regimes. With AU-level spatial
resolution, we first establish characteristic sizes of the infrared emission
using a simple geometrical model consisting of a hot inner rim and mid-infrared
disk emission. We find a high degree of correlation between the stellar
luminosity and the mid-infrared disk sizes after using near-infrared data to
remove the contribution from the inner rim. We then use a semi-analytical
physical model to also find that the very widely used ""star + inner dust rim +
flared disk"" class of models strongly fails to reproduce the SED and
spatially-resolved mid-infrared data simultaneously; specifically a more
compact source of mid-infrared emission is required than results from the
standard flared disk model. We explore the viability of a modification to the
model whereby a second dust rim containing smaller dust grains is added, and
find that the two-rim model leads to significantly improved fits in most cases.
This complexity is largely missed when carrying out SED modelling alone,
although detailed silicate feature fitting by McClure et al. 2013 recently came
to a similar conclusion. As has been suggested recently by Menu et al. 2015,
the difficulty in predicting mid-infrared sizes from the SED alone might hint
at ""transition disk""-like gaps in the inner AU; however, the relatively high
correlation found in our mid-infrared disk size vs. stellar luminosity relation
favors layered disk morphologies and points to missing disk model ingredients
instead.

The first method involves calculating the False Alarm Probability (FAP) using
non-parametric bootstrap resampling, and the second method is by calculating
the difference in Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) between the null
hypothesis, viz. the data contains only noise, compared to the hypothesis that
the data contains a peak at a given frequency. Using these methods, we scan the
frequency range between 7-14 cycles per year to look for any peaks caused by
solar rotation, since this is the proposed explanation for the statistically
significant peaks found by Sturrock and collaborators in the Super-K dataset.
From our analysis, we do confirm that similar to Sturrock et al, the maximum
peak occurs at a frequency of 9.42/year, corresponding to a period of 38.75
days. The FAP for this peak is about 1.5% and the difference in BIC (between
pure white noise and this peak) is about 4.8. We note that the significance
depends on the frequency band used to search for peaks and hence it is
important to use a search band appropriate for solar rotation. However, the
significance of this peak based on the value of BIC is marginal and more data
is needed to confirm if the peak persists and is real.

reproduced using our force field. Because the two stretching modes of the
$\tilde{\text{C}}$ state are strongly coupled via Fermi-133 interaction, the
vibrational structure of the $\tilde{\text{C}}$ state is analyzed in a
Fermi-system basis set, constructed explicitly in this work via
$\textit{partial}$ $\textit{diagonalization}$ of the vibrational Hamiltonian.
The physical significance of the Fermi-system basis is discussed in terms of
semiclassical dynamics, based on study of Fermi-resonance systems by Kellman
and coworkers [M. E. Kellman and L. Xiao, J. Chem. Phys. $\textbf{93}$, 5821
(1990)]. By diagonalizing the vibrational Hamiltonian in the Fermi-system
basis, the vibrational characters of all vibrational levels can be determined
unambiguously. It is shown that the bending mode cannot be treated separately
from the coupled stretching modes, particularly at vibrational energies of more
than 2000 cm$^{-1}$. Based on our force field, the structure of the Coriolis
interactions in the $\tilde{\text{C}}$ state of SO$_2$ is also discussed. We
identify the origin of the alternating patterns in the effective $C$ rotational
constants of levels in the vibrational progressions of the symmetry-breaking
mode, $\nu_\beta$ (which correlates with the antisymmetric stretching mode in
our assignment scheme).

states the minimal number of developers that have to be hit by a truck (or

how prepared is a project to deal with developer turnover. Despite its clear
relevance, few studies explore this metric. Altogether there is no consensus
about how to calculate it, and no supporting evidence backing estimates for
systems in the wild. To mitigate both issues, we propose a novel (and
automated) approach for estimating TF-values, which we execute against a corpus
of 133 popular project in GitHub. We later survey developers as a means to
assess the reliability of our results. Among others, we find that the majority
of our target systems (65%) have TF <= 2. Surveying developers from 67 target

regimes of an optically levitated nanoparticle cooled by cavityless parametric
feedback. Our treatment is based on a generalized Fokker-Planck equation
derived from the quantum master equation presented recently and shown to agree
very well with experiment [1]. For low damping, we find that the resulting
Wigner function yields the single-peaked oscillator position distribution and
recovers the appropriate energy distribution derived earlier using a classical
theory and verified experimentally [2]. For high damping, in contrast, we
predict a double-peaked position distribution, which we trace to an underlying
bistability induced by feedback. Unlike in cavity-based optomechanics,
stochastic processes play a major role in determining the bistable behavior. To
support our conclusions, we present analytical expressions as well as numerical
simulations using the truncated Wigner function approach. Our work opens up the
prospect of developing bistability-based devices, characterization of
phase-space dynamics, and investigation of the quantum-classical transition

under the transformation $t goes to -t$. This invariance at first sight appears
to impose time reversibility as a principle of physics, in conflict with
thermodynamics. But equations written on the blackboard are not the whole story
in physics. In prior work we sharpened a distinction obscured in today's
theoretical physics, the distinction between obtaining evidence from
experiments on the laboratory bench and explaining that evidence in
mathematical symbols on the blackboard. The sharp distinction rests on a proof
within the mathematics of quantum theory that no amount of evidence,
represented in quantum theory in terms of probabilities, can uniquely determine
its explanation in terms of wave functions and linear operators. Building on
the proof we show here a role in physics for unpredictable symbol-handling
agents acting both at the blackboard and at the workbench, communicating back
and forth by means of transmitted symbols. Because of their unpredictability,
symbol-handling agents introduce a heretofore overlooked source of
irreversibility into physics, even when the equations they write on the
blackboard are invariant under t goes to -t$. Widening the scope of
descriptions admissible to physics to include the agents and the symbols that
link theory to experiments opens up a new source of time-irreversibility in

Dirac spinors of rank 2j, obtained as the local direct product of n Dirac
spinor copies, with n=2j. Such spinors are reducible, and contain also
(j,0)+(0,j)-pure spin representation spaces. The 2(2j+1) degrees of freedom of
the latter are identified by a projector given by the n-fold direct product of
the covariant parity projector within the Dirac spinor space. Considering
totally symmetric tensor spinors one is left with the expected number of
2(2j+1) independent degrees of freedom. The BW projector is of the order
$\partial ^{2j}$ in the derivatives, and so are the related spin-j wave
equations and associated Lagrangians. High order differential equations can not
be consistently gauged, and allow several unphysical aspects, such as
non-locality, acausality, ghosts and etc to enter the theory. In order to avoid
these difficulties we here suggest a strategy of replacing the high order of
the BW wave equations by the universal second order. To do so we replaced the
BW projector by one of zeroth order in the derivatives. We built it up from one
of the Casimir invariants of the Lorentz group when exclusively acting on
spaces of internal spin degrees of freedom. This projector allows one to
identify anyone of the irreducible sectors of the primordial rank-2j spinor, in
particular (j,0)+(0,j), and without any reference to the external space-time
and the four-momentum. The dynamics is then introduced by requiring the (j,0)+
(0,j) sector to satisfy the Klein-Gordon equation. The scheme allows for a
consistent minimal gauging.

substantial fraction (~80%) of the GRXE in the Fe band was resolved into point
sources by deep Chandra imaging observations, thus GRXE is mostly composed of
dim Galactic X-ray point sources at least in this energy band. To investigate
the populations of these dim X-ray point sources, we carried out Near-Infrared
(NIR) follow-up spectroscopic observations in two deep Chandra fields located
in the Galactic plane at (l,b)=(0.1{\arcdeg}, -1.4{\arcdeg}) and
(28.5{\arcdeg}, 0.0{\arcdeg}) using NTT/SofI and Subaru/MOIRCS. We obtained
well-exposed NIR spectra from 65 objects and found that there are three main
classes of Galactic sources based on the X-ray color and NIR spectral features:
those having (A) hard X-ray spectra and NIR emission features such as
HI(Br{\gamma}), HeI, and HeII (2 objects), (B) soft X-ray spectra and NIR
absorption features such as HI, NaI, CaI, and CO (46 objects), and (C) hard
X-ray spectra and NIR absorption features such as HI, NaI, CaI and CO (17
objects). From these features, we argue that class A sources are Cataclysmic
Variables (CVs), and class B sources are late-type stars with enhanced coronal
activity, which is in agreement with current knowledge. Class C sources
possibly belong to a new group of objects, which has been poorly studied so
far. We argue that the candidate sources for class C are the binary systems
hosting white dwarfs and late-type companions with very low accretion rates. It
is likely that this newly recognized class of the sources contribute to a
non-negligible fraction of the GRXE, especially in the Fe K band.

it, none of them is easily integrated with common solvers. Constraint
programming is a fundamental paradigm used to approach various families of
problems. We introduce Utilitarian Distributed Constraint Satisfaction Problems
(UDisCSP) where the utility of each state is estimated as the difference
between the the expected rewards for agreements on assignments for shared
variables, and the expected cost of privacy loss. Therefore, a traditional
DisCSP with privacy requirements is viewed as a planning problem. The actions
available to agents are: communication and local inference. Common
decentralized solvers are evaluated here from the point of view of their
interpretation as greedy planners. Further, we investigate some simple
extensions where these solvers start taking into account the utility function.
In these extensions we assume that the planning problem is further restricting
the set of communication actions to only the communication primitives present
in the corresponding solver protocols. The solvers obtained for the new type of
problems propose the action (communication/inference) to be performed in each
situation, defining thereby the policy.

[OIII]/Hb, compared with local galaxies. Based on the [SII] ratio, we measure
an electron density ($n_e=220^{+170}_{-130}~\mathrm{cm^{-3}}$), that is higher
than that of local galaxies. Based on comparisons to theoretical models, we
argue that changes in emission-line ratios, including the offset in the BPT

and at fixed metallicity with additional contributions from a higher gas
density and possibly a hardening of the ionizing radiation field. Ionization
due to AGNs is ruled out as assessed with Chandra. As a consequence, we revisit
the mass-metallicity relation using [NII]/Ha and a new calibration including
[NII]/[SII] as recently introduced by Dopita et al. Consistent with our
previous results, the most massive galaxies ($M_\ast\gtrsim10^{11}~M_\odot$)
are fully enriched, while those at lower masses have metallicities lower than
local galaxies. Finally, we demonstrate that the stellar masses, metallicities

estimate the self-shielding density with a fitting function calibrated using
radiation transport simulations, and correct for molecular hydrogen with
empirical or theoretical relations. The `standard-resolution' simulations
systematically underestimate HI column densities, leading to an HI deficiency
in low-mass ($M_\star < 10^{10}M_\odot$) galaxies and poor reproduction of the
observed HI mass function. These shortcomings are largely absent from EAGLE
simulations featuring a factor of 8 (2) better mass (spatial) resolution,
within which the HI mass of galaxies evolves more mildly from $z=1$ to $0$ than
in the standard-resolution simulations. The largest-volume simulation
reproduces the observed clustering of HI systems, and its dependence on
HI-richness. At fixed $M_\star$, galaxies acquire more HI in simulations with
stronger feedback, as they become associated with more massive haloes and
higher infall rates. They acquire less HI in simulations with a greater star
formation efficiency, since the star formation and feedback necessary to
balance the infall rate is produced by smaller gas reservoirs. The simulations
indicate that the HI of present-day galaxies was acquired primarily by the
smooth accretion of ionized, intergalactic gas at $z\simeq1$, which later
self-shields, and that only a small fraction is contributed by the
reincorporation of gas previously heated strongly by feedback. HI reservoirs
are highly dynamic: over $40$ percent of HI associated with $z=0.1$ galaxies is
converted to stars or ejected by $z=0$.

limit at a generic filling $\nu = \frac{1}{n}$. We begin with the old
observation that, in compressible states, the composite fermion in the lowest
Landau level should be viewed as a charge-neutral particle carrying vorticity.
This leads to the absence of a Chern-Simons term in the effective theory of the
CFL. We argue here that instead a Berry curvature should be enclosed by the
fermi surface of composite fermions, with the total Berry phase fixed by the
filling fraction $\phi_B=-2\pi\nu$. We illustrate this point with the CFL of
fermions at filling fractions $\nu=1/2q$ and (single and two-component) bosons
at $\nu=1/(2q+1)$. The Berry phase leads to sharp consequences in the transport
properties including thermal and spin Hall conductances, which in the RPA
approximation are distinct from the standard Halperin-Lee-Read predictions. We
emphasize that these results only rely on the LLL limit, and do not require
particle-hole symmetry, which is present microscopically only for fermions at
$\nu=1/2$. Nevertheless, we show that the existing LLL theory of the composite
fermi liquid for bosons at $\nu=1$ does have an emergent particle-hole
symmetry. We interpret this particle-hole symmetry as a transformation between
the empty state at $\nu=0$ and the boson integer quantum hall state at $\nu=2$.
This understanding enables us to define particle-hole conjugates of various
bosonic quantum Hall states which we illustrate with the bosonic Jain and
Pfaffian states. The bosonic particle-hole symmetry can be realized exactly on
the surface of a three-dimensional boson topological insulator. We also show
that with the particle-hole and spin $SU(2)$ rotation symmetries, there is no
gapped topological phase for bosons at $\nu=1$.

thus hosted by dark matter haloes of larger mass than their unobscured

models, in which obscured objects are intrinsically the same as unobscured
sources but seen through a dusty line of sight. There is general consensus that
a structure like a ""dusty torus"" exists, meaning that this intrinsic similarity
is likely the case for at least some subset of obscured quasars. However, the
larger host halo masses of obscured quasars implies that there is a second
obscured population that has an even higher clustering amplitude and typical
halo mass. Here, we use simple assumptions about the host halo mass
distributions of quasars, along with analytical methods and cosmological
$N$-body simulations to isolate the signal from this population. We provide
values for the bias and halo mass as a function of the fraction of the
""non-torus obscured"" population. Adopting a reasonable value for this fraction
of $\sim$25% implies a non-torus obscured quasar bias that is much higher than
the observed obscured quasar bias, because a large fraction of the obscured
population shares the same clustering strength as the unobscured objects. For
this non-torus obscured population, we derive a bias of $\sim$3, and typical
halo masses of $\sim3\times10^{13}$ M$_{\odot}/h$ at $z=1$. These massive
haloes are likely the descendants of high-mass unobscured quasars at high

from the presence of young stars. The bulges in galaxies with low

challenging in that it requires solving a non-convex optimization problem. This
paper shows a remarkable result: despite the non-convexity of the TREX problem,
there exists a polynomial-time algorithm that is guaranteed to find the global
minimum. This result adds the TREX to a very short list of non-convex
optimization problems that can be globally optimized (principal components
analysis being a famous example). After deriving and developing this new
approach, we demonstrate that (i) the ability of the preexisting TREX heuristic
to reach the global minimum is strongly dependent on the difficulty of the
underlying statistical problem, (ii) the new polynomial-time algorithm for TREX
permits a novel variable ranking and selection scheme, (iii) this scheme can be
incorporated into a rule that controls the false discovery rate (FDR) of
included features in the model. To achieve this last aim, we provide an
extension of the results of Barber & Candes (2015) to establish that the
knockoff filter framework can be applied to the TREX. This investigation thus
provides both a rare case study of a heuristic for non-convex optimization and
a novel way of exploiting non-convexity for statistical inference.

The classical point for the action, defined as a minus logarithm of the growth

as a rule, is not applied out from equilibrium. Each layer's probability is
expressed as a product of simple factors in an auxiliary complex plane after a
properly chosen conformal map. The action at this plane is a sum of Robin
functions, which solve the Liouville equation. At the end we establish
connections of our theory with the tau-function of the integrable Toda
hierarchy and with the Liouville theory for non-critical quantum strings.

approximate general POPs with a conic optimization problem over the cone of

time-dependent density functional theory while the extrinsic losses are

columns of the density matrix (SCDM) method [J. Chem. Theory Comput. 11, 1463,
2015] is a simple and robust procedure for finding a localized representation
of a set of Kohn-Sham orbitals from an insulating system. The SCDM method
allows the direct construction of a well conditioned (or even orthonormal) and
localized basis for the Kohn-Sham subspace. The SCDM algorithm avoids the use
of an optimization procedure and does not depend on any adjustable parameters.
The most computationally expensive step of the SCDM method is a column pivoted
QR factorization that identifies the important columns for constructing the
localized basis set. In this paper, we develop a two stage approximate column
selection strategy to find the important columns at much lower computational
cost. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this process using the dissociation
process of a BH$_3$NH$_3$ molecule, an alkane chain and a supercell with 256
water molecules. Numerical results for the large collection of water molecules
show that two stage localization procedure can be more than 30 times faster

we intend to answer this question and introduce a novel strategy that alters
the architecture of a given CNN for a specified dataset, to potentially enhance
the original accuracy while possibly reducing the model size. We use two
operations for architecture refinement, viz. stretching and symmetrical
splitting. Our procedure starts with a pre-trained CNN for a given dataset, and
optimally decides the stretch and split factors across the network to refine
the architecture. We empirically demonstrate the necessity of the two
operations. We evaluate our approach on two natural scenes attributes datasets,
SUN Attributes and CAMIT-NSAD, with architectures of GoogleNet and VGG-11, that
are quite contrasting in their construction. We justify our choice of datasets,
and show that they are interestingly distinct from each other, and together
pose a challenge to our architectural refinement algorithm. Our results
substantiate the usefulness of the proposed method.

the settings of various emerging problems in the theory of diffusion geometry.
The starting point of the now classical diffusion geometry approach is the
construction of a kernel whose discretization leads to an undirected graph
structure on an unstructured data set. We study the question of constructing
such kernels for directed graph structures, and argue that our construction is
essentially the only way to do so using discretizations of kernels. We then use
our previous theory to develop harmonic analysis based on the singular value
decomposition of the resulting non-self-adjoint operators associated with the
directed graph. Next, we consider the question of how functions defined on one
space evolves to another space in the paradigm of changing data sets recently
introduced by Coifman and Hirn. While the approach of Coifman and Hirn require
that the points on one space should be in a known one-to-one correspondence
with the points on the other, our approach allows the identification of only a
subset of landmark points. We introduce a new definition of distance between
points on two spaces, construct localized kernels based on the two spaces and
certain interaction parameters, and study the evolution of smoothness of a
function on one space to its lifting to the other space via the landmarks. We
develop novel mathematical tools that enable us to study these seemingly
different problems in a unified manner.

138--142]. An initially fast adsorption dynamics driven by capillary forces is
followed by an unexpectedly slow relaxation to equilibrium that is logarithmic
in time and can span hours or days. The slow relaxation kinetics has been
attributed to the presence of surface ""defects"" with nanoscale dimensions
(1--5\,nm) that induce multiple metastable configurations of the contact line
perimeter. A kinetic model considering thermally activated transitions between
such metastable configurations has been proposed [Colosqui \textit{et al.,

rate and the crossover point to the slow logarithmic regime. However, the
adsorption dynamics observed experimentally before the crossover point has
remained unstudied. In this work, we propose a Langevin model that is able to
describe the entire adsorption process of single colloidal particles by
considering metastable states produced by surface defects and thermal motion of
the particle and liquid interface. Invoking the fluctuation dissipation
theorem, we introduce a drag term that considers significant dissipative forces
induced by thermal fluctuations of the liquid interface. Langevin dynamics
simulations based on the proposed adsorption model yield close agreement with
experimental observations for different microparticles, capturing the crossover
from (fast) capillary driven dynamics to (slow) thermally activated kinetics.

technique to achieve high spectral efficiency in wireless systems. For the
point-to-point MIMO channel, it is a well-known result that the channel
singular value decomposition (SVD) based linear precoding and decoding achieves
the channel capacity, which also diagonalizes the MIMO channel into parallel
single-input single-output (SISO) sub-channels for independent encoding and
decoding. However, in multi-user MIMO systems, the optimal transmit covariance
of each MIMO link is generally not its channel SVD based as a result of the
control and balance of the co-channel interference among users. Thus, it
remains unknown whether the linear precoding/decoding strategy is still able to
achieve the capacity of each MIMO link and yet diagonalize its MIMO channel,
with a given set of optimal transmit covariance of all users. This letter
solves this open problem by providing a closed-form capacity-achieving linear
precoder/decoder design that diagonalizes a MIMO channel with arbitrary

observes a new message in the beginning of each block and a decoder
sequentially decodes each message after a delay of $T$ blocks. In this
streaming setup, the fundamental interplay between the coding rate, the error
probability, and the blocklength in the moderate deviations regime is studied.
For output symmetric channels, the moderate deviations constant is shown to
improve over the block coding or non-streaming setup by exactly a factor of $T$
for a certain range of moderate deviations scalings. For the converse proof, a
more powerful decoder to which some extra information is fedforward is assumed.
The error probability is bounded first for an auxiliary channel and this result
is translated back to the original channel by using a newly developed
change-of-measure lemma, where the speed of decay of the remainder term in the
exponent is carefully characterized. For the achievability proof, a known

impact of charged impurity and phonon scattering on mobility in devices based
on 2D transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs), considerable effort has been put
into exploring various doping techniques and dielectric engineering using
$high-\kappa$ oxides, respectively. The goal of this work is to demonstrate a
$high-\kappa$ dielectric that serves as an effective n-type charge transfer
dopant on monolayer (ML) molybdenum disulfide ($MoS_{2}$). Utilizing amorphous
titanium suboxide (ATO) as the '$high-\kappa$ dopant', we achieved a contact
resistance of ~ $180$ ${\Omega}.{\mu}m$ which is the lowest reported value for
ML $MoS_{2}$. An ON current as high as $240$ ${\mu}A/{\mu}m$ and field effect
mobility as high as $83$ $cm^2/V-s$ were realized using this doping technique.
Moreover, intrinsic mobility as high as $102$ $cm^2/V-s$ at $300$ $K$ and $501$
$cm^2/V-s$ at $77$ $K$ were achieved after ATO encapsulation which are among
the highest mobility values reported on ML $MoS_{2}$. We also analyzed the
doping effect of ATO films on ML $MoS_{2}$, a phenomenon which is absent when
stoichiometric $TiO_{2}$ is used, using ab initio density functional theory
(DFT) calculations which shows excellent agreement with our experimental
findings. Based on the interfacial-oxygen-vacancy mediated doping as seen in
the case of $high-\kappa$ ATO - ML $MoS_{2}$, we propose a mechanism for the
mobility enhancement effect observed in TMD-based devices after encapsulation
in a $high-\kappa$ dielectric environment.

(ESQPTs) defined in Ann.Phys. 323, 1106 (2008). In many-body models that
exhibit such transitions, the ground state quantum phase transition (QPT)
occurs in parallel with a singularity in the energy spectrum that propagates to
higher energies as the control parameter increases beyond the QPT critical
point. The analysis of the spectrum has been a main tool for the detection of
these ESQPTs. Studies of the effects of this transition on the system dynamics
are more limited. Here, we extend our previous works and show that the
evolution of an initial state with energy close to the ESQPT critical point may
be extremely slow. This result is surprising, because it may take place in
systems with long-range interactions, where the dynamics is usually expected to
be very fast. A timely example is the one-dimensional spin-1/2 model with
infinite-range Ising interaction studied in experiments with ion traps. Its
Hamiltonian has a U(2) algebraic structure. More generally, the slow dynamics
described here occurs in two-level bosonic or fermionic models with pairing
interactions and a U(v+1) Hamiltonian exhibiting a QPT between its limiting
U(v) and SO(v+1) dynamical symmetries. In this work, we compare the results for
v=1, 2, and 3.

were considered as well as co-occurrence and appearance of objects by using
energy-based model, where the energy function was defined as the region-object

subscribers. However, an advertisement tree and a matching subscription
activates only one path for notifications routing in publish/subscribe systems.
This poses serious challenges in handling network conditions like congestion,
and link or broker failures. Further, content-based dynamic routing of
notifications requires instantaneous updates in routing paths, which is not a
scalable option. This paper introduces a clustering approach with a bit-vector
technique for inter-cluster dynamic routing of notifications in a structured
cyclic topology that provides multiple paths between publishers and interested
subscribers. The advertisement forwarding process exploits the structured
nature of the overlay topology to generate advertisement trees of length 1
without generating duplicate messages in the advertisement forwarding process.
Issued subscriptions are divided into multiple disjoint subgropus, where each
subscription is broadcast to a cluster, which is a limited part of the
structured cyclic overlay network. We implemented novel static and
intra-cluster dynamic routing algorithms in the proposed overlay topology for
our advertisement-based publish/subscribe system, called OctopiA. We also
performed a pragmatic comparison of our two algorithms with the
state-of-the-art. Experiments on a cluster testbed show that our approach
generates fewer inter-broker messages, and is scalable.

This has been calculated to the sixth order in experiments. Corresponding
theoretical studies on the sixth order cumulant are necessary. Based on the
universality of the critical behavior, we study the temperature dependence of
the sixth order cumulant of the order parameter using the parametric
representation of the three-dimensional Ising model, which is expected to be in
the same universality class as QCD. The density plot of the sign of the sixth
order cumulant is shown on the temperature and external magnetic field plane.
We found that at non-zero external magnetic field, when the critical point is
approached from the crossover side, the sixth order cumulant has a negative
valley. The width of the negative valley narrows with decreasing external
field. Qualitatively, the trend is similar to the result of Monte Carlo
simulation on a finite-size system. Quantitatively, the temperature of the sign
change is different. Through Monte Carlo simulation of the Ising model, we
calculated the sixth order cumulant of different sizes of systems. We discuss
the finite-size effects on the temperature at which the cumulant changes sign.

calculations of energies, sum rules and transition densities for the

be in good agreement with the experimental data. By using the Strutinsky shell
correction method, the semiclassical collective transport coefficients such as
nuclear inertia, friction, stiffness, and moments of inertia can be derived
beyond the quantum perturbation approximation of the response function theory

compared to its irrotational flow value. Shell components of the moment of
inertia are derived in terms of the periodic-orbit free-energy shell

study the quantum discord and fully entangled fraction of two classes of
bipartite states and compare their behaviors. These classes are complements to
the $d\otimes d$ Werner and isotropic states, in the sense that each class
possesses the same purification as the corresponding complemental class of
states. Our results show that maximally entangled mixed states are also
maximally discordant states, leading to a generalization of the well-known fact
that all maximally entangled pure states have also maximum quantum discord.
Moreover, it is shown that the separability-entanglement boundary of a Werner

quantum discord of the corresponding complemental state.

an enhanced electronic coupling between the cation and the \ce{PbI6} octahedra
while maintaining the band gap energy within the suitable range for solar

electronegativity of the materials' constituents and the resulting ionic
electrostatic interactions. The calculations demonstrate the concept of
enhancing the electronic coupling, and hence the stability, by exploring the

model stellar spiral arms with different longevities: quasi-stationary density
wave theory, which characterises spirals as rigidly rotating, long-lived
patterns (i.e. steady spirals), and dynamic spiral theory, which characterises
spirals as differentially rotating, transient, recurrent patterns (i.e. dynamic
spirals). In order to discriminate between these two spiral models
observationally, we investigated the differences between the gas velocity
patterns predicted by these two spiral models in hydrodynamic simulations. We
found that the azimuthal phases of the velocity patterns relative to the gas
density peaks (i.e. gaseous arms) differ between the two models, as do the gas
flows; nevertheless, the velocity patterns themselves are similar for both
models. Such similarity suggests that the mere existence of streaming motions
does not conclusively confirm the steady spiral model. However, we found that
the steady spiral model shows that the gaseous arms have radial streaming
motions well inside the co-rotation radius, whereas the dynamic spiral model
predicts that the gaseous arms tend to have tangential streaming motions. These
differences suggest that the gas velocity patterns around spiral arms will
enable distinction between the spiral theories.

voting, and which can be described as follows. Initially each vertex holds one
of two opinions, red or blue say. Neighbouring vertices with different opinions
interact pairwise. After an interaction both vertices have the same colour. The
quantity of interest is T, the time to reach consensus , i.e. the number of
interactions needed for all vertices have the same colour.
  An edge whose endpoint colours differ (i.e. one vertex is coloured red and
the other one blue) is said to be discordant. A vertex is discordant if its is
incident with a discordant edge. In discordant voting, all interactions are
based on discordant edges. Because the voting process is asynchronous there are
several ways to update the colours of the interacting vertices. Push: Pick a
random discordant vertex and push its colour to a random discordant neighbour.
Pull: Pick a random discordant vertex and pull the colour of a random
discordant neighbour. Oblivious: Pick a random endpoint of a random discordant
edge and push the colour to the other end point.
  We show that E(T), the expected time to reach consensus, depends strongly on
the underlying graph and the update rule. For connected graphs on n vertices,
and an initial half red, half blue colouring the following hold. For oblivious
voting, E(T) =n^2/4 independent of the underlying graph. For the complete graph
K_n, the push protocol has E(T)= Theta(n log(n)), whereas the pull protocol has
E(T)= Theta(2^n). For the cycle C_n all three protocols have E(T) = Theta(n^2).
For the star graph however, the pull protocol has E(T)=O(n^2), whereas the push
protocol is slower with E(T) = Theta(n^2 log(n)).
  The wide variation in E(T) for the pull protocol is to be contrasted with the
well known model of synchronous pull voting, for which E(T) = O(n) on many
classes of expanders.

halo to the angular velocity dispersions and the density of a tracer population

seen in the data on stellar halo stars in the Milky Way. The angular anisotropy
and gradients in the angular velocity dispersions drive the solutions towards
prolateness, whilst the gradient in the stellar density is a competing effect
favouring oblateness. We provide an efficient numerical algorithm to integrate
the flattening equation. Using tests on mock data, we show that the there is a
strong degeneracy between circular speed and flattening, which can be
circumvented with informative priors. Therefore, we advocate the use of the
flattening equation to test for oblateness or prolateness, though the precise
value of the flattening $q$ can only be measured with the addition of the
radial Jeans equation. We apply the flattening equation to a sample extracted
from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey of $\sim 15000$ halo stars with full phase
space information and errors. We find that between Galactocentric radii of 5
and 10 kpc, the shape of the dark halo is prolate, whilst even mildly oblate
models are disfavoured. Strongly oblate models are ruled out. Specifically, for
a logarithmic halo model, if the asymptotic circular speed $v_0$ lies between
$210$ and 250 kms$^{-1}$, then we find the axis ratio of the equipotentials $q$
satisfies $1.5 \lesssim q \lesssim 2$.

universal contributions to the entanglement entropy and R\'enyi entropy. In
this paper we study universal corner contributions to entanglement negativity
in three- and four-dimensional CFTs using both field theory and holographic
techniques. We focus on the quantity $\chi$ defined by the ratio of the
universal part of the entanglement negativity over that of the entanglement
entropy, which may characterise the amount of distillable entanglement. We find
that for most of the examples $\chi$ takes bigger values for singular
entangling regions, which may suggest increase in distillable entanglement.
However, there also exist counterexamples where distillable entanglement
decreases for singular surfaces. We also explore the behaviour of $\chi$ as the
coupling varies and observe that for singular entangling surfaces, the amount
of distillable entanglement is mostly largest for free theories, while
counterexample exists for free Dirac fermion in three dimensions. For
holographic CFTs described by higher derivative gravity, $\chi$ may increase or
decrease, depending on the sign of the relevant parameters. Our results may
reveal a more profound connection between geometry and distillable
entanglement.

The objective consists in maximazing the sum of the expected cumulative

payment at the time of ruin, which is an increasing function of the size of the
shortfall at ruin. A complete solution is presented to the corresponding
stochastic control problem. We identify the associated Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman

transparent epoxy resin covering the electric components. The correlation of
the rate and the amplitude of the signal with the temperature has been
observed. For the first detector in operation the induced background has been
mitigated using online and offline analysis selections based on timing and
light pattern of the signals, while a modification of the photomultiplier
assembly has been implemented for the second detector in order to blacken the

tasks: textual entailment (TE) and answer selection (AS), observing that phrase
alignments of different intensities contribute differently in these tasks. We
address the problems of identifying phrase alignments of flexible granularity
and pooling alignments of different intensities for these tasks. Examples for
flexible granularity are alignments between two single words, between a single
word and a phrase and between a short phrase and a long phrase. By intensity we
roughly mean the degree of match, it ranges from identity over surface-form
co-occurrence, rephrasing and other semantic relatedness to unrelated words as
in lots of parenthesis text. Prior work (i) has limitations in phrase
generation and representation, or (ii) conducts alignment at word and phrase
levels by handcrafted features or (iii) utilizes a single attention mechanism
over alignment intensities without considering the characteristics of specific
tasks, which limits the system's effectiveness across tasks. We propose an
architecture based on Gated Recurrent Unit that supports (i) representation
learning of phrases of arbitrary granularity and (ii) task-specific focusing of
phrase alignments between two sentences by attention pooling. Experimental
results on TE and AS match our observation and are state-of-the-art.

suggested as a sensitive and simple technique to facilitate resonance detection

replacing the conventional electromagnets scheme. We present some preliminary
test results which demonstrate resonance detection from simulated test signals
in a small optimal axion mass range with superior Signal-to-Noise Ratios (SNR).

signal read-out scheme replacing the complicated heterodyne readout. We believe
that all these factors and our propositions could possibly improve or at least
simplify the resonance detection and read-out in cavity-based DM particle

M~10^14 M_sun vs. M~10^15 M_sun. We discuss how mass affects the thermal state
of the intracluster or the intragroup medium, specifically as to their entropy
levels and radial profiles. We show that entropy is produced in both cases by
the continuing inflow of intergalactic gas across the system boundary into the
gravitational potential well. The inflow is highly supersonic in clusters, but
weakly so in groups. The former condition implies strong accretion shocks with
substantial conversion of a large inflow kinetic into thermal energy, whereas
the latter condition implies less effective conversion of lower energies. These
features produce a conspicuous difference in entropy deposition at the current
boundary. Thereafter, adiabatic compression of the hot gas into the potential
well converts such time histories into radial profiles throughout a cluster or
a group. In addition, in both cases a location of the system at low z in the
accelerating universe or in a poor environment will starve out the inflow and
the entropy production, and produce flattening or even bending down of the
outer profile. We analyze in detail the sharp evidence provided by the two
groups ESO 3060170 and RXJ1159+5531 that have been recently observed in X rays

crystal state for a system with crystal polymorphism. The rule describes the
irreversible way a system converts to the crystal with lowest free energy. But
in fact the irreversible way a supercooled gas below the triple point
temperature $T_{tr.p.}$ crystallizes via a liquid droplet is an example of
Ostwald's step rule. The homogeneous nucleation in the supersaturated gas is
not to a crystal, but to a liquid-like critical nucleus. We have for the first
time performed constant energy (NVE) Molecular Dynamics (MD) of homogeneous
nucleation without the use of a thermostat. The simulations of homogeneous
nucleation in a Lennard-Jones system from supersaturated vapor at temperatures
below $T_{tr.p.}$ reveals that the nucleation to a liquid-like critical nucleus
is initiated by a small cold cluster [S. Toxvaerd, J. Chem. Phys. \textbf{143}
154705 (2015)]. The release of latent heat at the subsequent droplet growth
increases the temperature in the liquid-like droplet, which for not deep
supercooling and/or low supersaturation, can exceed $T_{tr.p.}$. The
temperature of the liquid-like droplet increases less for a low supersaturation
and remains below $T_{tr.p.}$, but without a crystallization of the droplet for
long times. The dissipation of the latent heat into the surrounding gas is
affected by a traditional MD thermostat, with the consequence that droplet
growth is different for (NVE) MD and constant temperature (NVT) MD.
