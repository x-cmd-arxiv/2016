claims the existence of a cosmic music and a cosmic sound. According to the
Pythagorean argument, there exists a cosmic music produced by stars and
planets. These celestial bodies generate sound in its movements, and the music
appears due to the cosmic harmony. For Aristotle, there is no sound produced by
celestial bodies. Then, there is no music as well. However, recently, LIGO
(Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Waves Observatory) has detected the
gravitational waves predicted by Einstein. In some sense, a sound originated
from black holes has been heard. That is, Einstein or the General Relativity
and LIGO appear to be with the Pythagoreanism and against the master of the

diversity in collaboration behaviours of scientific fields. A growing geometric
hypergraph built on a cluster of concentric circles is proposed to model two
specific collaboration behaviours, namely the behaviour of leaders and that of
other members in research teams. The model successfully predicts the
transitions, as well as many common features of coauthorship networks.
Particulary, it realizes a process of deriving the complex ""scale-free""

explanation for the emergence of transitions with the difference of
collaboration behaviours between leaders and other members. The difference
emerges in the evolution of research teams, which synthetically addresses
several specific factors of generating collaborations, namely the
communications between research teams, the academic impacts and homophily of

implementation the MM atoms are considered as additional QM ions having
fractional charges of either sign, which provides conceptual and computational
simplicity by exploiting the machinery already existing in planewave codes to
deal with electrostatics in periodic boundary conditions. With this strategy,
both the QM and MM regions are contained in the same supercell, which
determines the periodicity for the whole system. Thus, while this method is not
meant to compete with non-periodic QM-MM schemes able to handle extremely large
but finite MM regions, it is shown that for periodic systems of a few hundred
atoms, our approach provides substantial savings in computational times by
treating classically a fraction of the particles. The performance and accuracy
of the method is assessed through the study of energetic, structural, and
dynamical aspects of the water dimer and of the aqueous bulk phase. Finally,
the QM-MM scheme is applied to the computation of the vibrational spectra of
water layers adsorbed at the TiO$_2$ anatase (101) solid-liquid interface. This
investigation suggests that the inclusion of a second monolayer of H$_2$O
molecules is sufficient to induce on the first adsorbed layer, a vibrational
dynamics similar to that taking place in the presence of an aqueous
environment. The present QM-MM scheme appears as a very interesting tool to
efficiently perform molecular dynamics simulations of complex condensed matter

reduce space.
  We introduce new techniques for compressing inverted indexes that exploit
this near-copy regularity. They are based on run-length, Lempel-Ziv, or grammar
compression of the differential inverted lists, instead of the usual practice
of gap-encoding them. We show that, in this highly repetitive setting, our
compression methods significantly reduce the space obtained with classical

universal, that is, they do not need to know the versioning structure of the
collection, nor that a clear versioning structure even exists.
  We also introduce compressed self-indexes in the comparison. These are
designed for general strings (not only natural language texts) and represent
the text collection plus the index structure (not an inverted index) in
integrated form. We show that these techniques can compress much further, using
a small fraction of the space required by our new inverted indexes. Yet, they
are orders of magnitude slower.

Initially, two parties, Alice and Bob, share a two-mode separable Gaussian

between two players. Bob is separable from the players but he can create
entanglement with either of the players if the other player moves to his
location and collaborates with him. Any two parties are separable and the
creation of entanglement is thus mediated by transmission of a mode which is
separable from individual modes on Alice's and Bob's side. For the state shared
by the players and Bob one cannot establish entanglement between any two modes
even with the help of operation on the third mode provided that Bob is
restricted to Gaussian measurements and the state thus carries a nontrivial
signature of bound entanglement. The present protocol also demonstrates
switching between different separability classes of tripartite systems by
coherent operations on its bipartite parts and complements studies on protocols
utilizing mixed partially entangled multipartite states.

to other formulations as Newton's equations, Lagrangian or Hamiltonian
Mechanics. It is particulary useful for the identification of conserved
quantities of a mechanical system. The primordial observation of a geometric
Hamilton-Jacobi equation is that if a Hamiltonian vector field $X_{H}$ can be
projected into the configuration manifold by means of a 1-form $dW$, then the
integral curves of the projected vector field $X_{H}^{dW}$can be transformed
into integral curves of $X_{H}$ provided that $W$ is a solution of the
Hamilton-Jacobi equation. This interpretation has been applied to multiple
settings: in nonhonolomic, singular Lagrangian Mechanics and classical field
theories. Our aim is to apply the geometric Hamilton-Jacobi theory to systems
endowed with a Nambu-Poisson structure. The Nambu-Poisson structure has shown
its interest in the study physical systems described by several Hamiltonian
functions. In this way, we will apply our theory to two interesting examples in
the Physics literature: the third-order Kummer-Schwarz equations and a system
of $n$ copies of a first-order differential Riccati equation. From these
examples, we retrieve the original Nambu bracket in three dimensions and a
generalization of the Nambu bracket to $n$ dimensions, respectively.

resulting dijet mass distribution yields no evidence of narrow resonances.
Upper limits are presented on the resonance cross sections as a function of

process of energy diffusion in functional networks. We extract node-based,
multi-scale features which describe the propagation of heat over 'time' which
not only inform the importance of a node in the graph, but also incorporate
local and global information of the underlying geometry of the network. As a
proof-of-concept, we test the efficacy of two heat kernel features for
discriminating between motor and working memory functional networks from the
Human Connectome Project. For comparison, we also classified task networks
using traditional network metrics which similarly provide rankings of node
importance. In addition, a variant of the Smooth Incremental Graphical Lasso
Estimation algorithm was used to estimate non-sparse, precision matrices to
account for non-stationarity in the time series. We illustrate differences in
heat kernel features between tasks, and also between regions of the brain.
Using a random forest classifier, we showed heat kernel metrics to capture

prototypes of Mott insulators, materials where electron-electron interactions
dominate transport phenomena. The main ingredient in the gravity dual is that
the gauge-field dynamics contains self-interactions by way of a particular type
of non-linear electrodynamics. The electrical response in these models exhibits
typical features of Mott-like states: i) the low-temperature DC conductivity is
unboundedly low; ii) metal-insulator transitions appear by varying various
parameters; iii) for large enough self-interaction strength, the conductivity
can even decrease with increasing doping (density of carriers), which appears
as a sharp manifestation of `traffic-jam'-like behaviour; iv) the insulating
state becomes very unstable towards superconductivity at large enough doping.
We exhibit some of the properties of the resulting insulator-superconductor
transition, which is sensitive to the amount of disorder in a specific way.
These models imply a clear and generic correlation between Mott behaviour and
significant effects in the nonlinear electrical response. We compute the
nonlinear current-voltage curve in our model and find that indeed at large

  model",,,,,"q-bio.PE math.DS q-bio.TO","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In this paper we propose an ecological resilience point of view on cancer.
This view is based on the analysis of a simple ODE model for the interactions
between cancer and normal cells. The model presents two regimes for tumor
growth. In the first, cancer arises due to three reasons: a partial corruption
of the functions that avoid the growth of mutated cells, an aggressive
phenotype of tumor cells and exposure to external carcinogenic factors. In this
case, treatments may be effective if they drive the system to the basin of
attraction of the cancer cure state. In the second regime, cancer arises
because the repair system is intrinsically corrupted. In this case, the
complete cure is not possible since the cancer cure state is no more stable,
but tumor recurrence may be delayed if treatment is prolongued. We review three
indicators of the resilience of a stable equilibrium, related with size and
shape of its basin of attraction: latitude, precariousness and resistance. A
novel method to calculate these indicators is proposed. This method is simpler
and more efficient than those currently used, and may be easily applied to
other population dynamics models. We apply this method to the model and
investigate how these indicators behave with parameters changes. Finally, we
present some simulations to illustrate how the resilience analysis can be
applied to validated models in order to obtain indicators for personalized
cancer treatments.

stars. Observations of cooling neutron stars indicate that the fast direct Urca
cooling is not operative for the typical, low mass stars, pointing at proton
fractions that lie below the threshold for the onset of direct Urca cooling
process. This in turn, restricts the density range admissible in neutron star
interiors and may require an excluded volume correction. In this contribution

significantly improved routing flexibility in all three dimensions and a

Using the correspondence of the method of simulating a $3+1$ dimensional

preliminarily obtains the analytical tools for describing ionic state
transition probabilities as a typical quantum oscillation feature. For
Dirac-like structures driven by generalized Poincar\'e classes of coupling

an adaptive platform for computing the quantum entanglement between the

quantum correlational content is then translated into the quantum entanglement
of two-qubit ionic states with quantum numbers related to the total angular
momentum and to its projection onto the direction of the trapping magnetic

be mapped into a Dirac-like system in the presence of an electrostatic field

constructor terms in the right-hand sides of rules are subterms of constructor
terms in the left-hand side; the computational intuition is that rules cannot
build new data structures. It is well-known that cons-free programming
languages can be used to characterize computational complexity classes, and
that cons-free first-order term rewriting can be used to characterize the set
of polynomial-time decidable sets.
  We investigate cons-free higher-order term rewriting systems, the complexity
classes they characterize, and how these depend on the order of the types used
in the systems. We prove that, for every k $\geq$ 1, left-linear cons-free
systems with type order k characterize E$^k$TIME if arbitrary evaluation is
used (i.e., the system does not have a fixed reduction strategy).
  The main difference with prior work in implicit complexity is that (i) our
results hold for non-orthogonal term rewriting systems with possible rule
overlaps with no assumptions about reduction strategy, (ii) results for such
term rewriting systems have previously only been obtained for k = 1, and with
additional syntactic restrictions on top of cons-freeness and left-linearity.
  Our results are apparently among the first implicit characterizations of the
hierarchy E = E$^1$TIME $\subseteq$ E$^2$TIME $\subseteq$ .... Our work
confirms prior results that having full non-determinism (via overlaps of rules)
does not directly allow characterization of non-deterministic complexity

characterized highly sensitive to minor syntactic changes such as admitting
product types or non-left-linear rules.

half duplex (HD) system at the link level. However, in a cellular network, FD
operation is not a straightforward extension of half duplex operations. The
increased interference due to a large number of simultaneous transmissions in
FD operation and realtime traffic conditions limits the capacity improvement.
Realizing the potential of FD requires careful coordination of resource
allocation among the cells as well as within the cell. In this paper, we
propose a distributed resource allocation, i.e., joint user selection and power
allocation for a FD multi-cell system, assuming FD base stations (BSs) and HD
user equipment (UEs). Due to the complexity of finding the globally optimum
solution, a sub-optimal solution for UE selection, and a novel geometric
programming based solution for power allocation, are proposed. The proposed
distributed approach converges quickly and performs almost as well as a
centralized solution, but with much lower signaling overhead. It provides a
hybrid scheduling policy which allows FD operations whenever it is
advantageous, but otherwise defaults to HD operation. We focus on small cell
systems because they are more suitable for FD operation, given practical
self-interference cancellation limits.With practical self-interference
cancellation, it is shown that the proposed hybrid FD system achieves nearly
two times throughput improvement for an indoor multi-cell scenario, and about
65% improvement for an outdoor multi-cell scenario compared to the HD system.

heat measurement on Ca$_3$Ir$_4$Sn$_{13}$ single crystals. The Seebeck
coefficient exhibits a peak corresponding to the anomaly in resistivity at
$T^*$, and the carrier density is suppressed significantly below $T^*$. This
indicates a significant Fermi surface reconstruction and the opening of the
charge density wave gap at the supperlattice transition. The magnetic field
induced enhancement of the residual specific heat coefficient $\gamma(H)$
exhibits a nearly linear dependence on magnetic field, indicating a nodeless
gap. In the temperature range close to $T_c$ the Seebeck coefficient can be
described well by the diffusion model. The zero-temperature extrapolated
thermoelectric power is very small, implying large normalized Fermi
temperature. Consequently the ratio $\frac{T_c}{T_F}$ is very small. Our
results indicate that Ca$_3$Ir$_4$Sn$_{13}$ is a weakly correlated nodeless
superconductor.

researchers for many years due to its complex and dynamic nature. Intrinsic
volatility in stock market across the globe makes the task of prediction
challenging. Forecasting and diffusion modeling, although effective can't be
the panacea to the diverse range of problems encountered in prediction,
short-term or otherwise. Market risk, strongly correlated with forecasting
errors, needs to be minimized to ensure minimal risk in investment. The authors
propose to minimize forecasting error by treating the forecasting problem as a
classification problem, a popular suite of algorithms in Machine learning. In
this paper, we propose a novel way to minimize the risk of investment in stock
market by predicting the returns of a stock using a class of powerful machine
learning algorithms known as ensemble learning. Some of the technical
indicators such as Relative Strength Index (RSI), stochastic oscillator etc are
used as inputs to train our model. The learning model used is an ensemble of
multiple decision trees. The algorithm is shown to outperform existing algo-
rithms found in the literature. Out of Bag (OOB) error estimates have been
found to be encouraging. Key Words: Random Forest Classifier, stock price
forecasting, Exponential smoothing, feature extraction, OOB error and

populations of dwarf satellites with different density profiles. The high
resolution cosmological $\rm \Lambda CDM$ ""ErisMod"" set of simulations is used.
These simulations can model both the stellar and dark matter components of the
satellites, and their evolution under the action of the tides of a MW-sized
host halo at a force resolution better than 10 pc. The stronger tidal mass loss
and re-shaping of the mass distribution induced in satellites with $\gamma=0.6$
dark matter density distributions, as those resulting from the effect of
feedback in hydrodynamical simulations of dwarf galaxy formation, is sufficient
to bring the circular velocity profiles in agreement with the kinematics of
MW's dSphs. In contrast, in simulations in which the satellites retain cusps at
$z=0$ there are several ""massive failures"" with circular velocities in excess
of the observational constraints. Various sources of deviations in the
conventionally adopted relation between the circular velocity at the half light
radius and the one dimensional line-of-sight velocity dispersions are found.
Such deviations are caused by the response of circular velocity profiles to
tidal effects, which also varies depending on the initially assumed inner
density profile, and by the complexity of the stellar kinematics, which include
residual rotation and anisotropy. In addition tidal effects naturally induce
large deviations in the stellar mass-halo mass relation for halo masses below
$\rm 10^9 ~ M_{\odot}$, preventing any reliable application of the abundance
matching technique to dwarf galaxy satellites.

accuracy of this method is limited due to galaxy merging and scatter in the
stellar mass growth history of individual galaxies. Behroozi et al. (2013) have
introduced a refinement of the method, based on abundance matching of observed
galaxies to the Bolshoi dark-matter-only simulation. The EAGLE cosmological
hydro-simulation is well suited to test this method, because it reproduces the
observed evolution of the galaxy stellar mass function and the passive
fraction. We find agreement with the Behroozi et al. (2013) method for the
complete sample of main progenitors of z = 0 galaxies, but we also find a
strong dependence on the current star formation rate. Passive galaxies with a
stellar mass up to 10^10.75 Msun have a completely different median mass
history than active galaxies of the same mass. This difference persists if we
only select central galaxies. This means that the cumulative number density

inconsistent with noise, due to fine spectral structure imprinted on the

sequences from other non-coding RNAs and pseudo miRNAs that have a similar
length, and most previous studies have recommended using precursor miRNAs
instead of mature miRNAs for robust detection. A great number of conventional

often have the serious disadvantage of requiring manual feature engineering,
and their performance is limited as well. In this paper, we propose a novel

networks, specifically long short-term memory networks. deepMiRGene
automatically learns suitable features from the data themselves without manual
feature engineering and constructs a model that can successfully reflect

ultimately, predicting their behaviours in a changing environment requires
overcoming the gap between mathematical models and experimental or
observational data. Differential equations (DEs) are commonly used to model the
temporal evolution of biological systems, but statistical methods for comparing
DE models to data and for parameter inference are relatively poorly developed.
This is especially problematic in the context of biological systems where
observations are often noisy and only a small number of time points may be
available. 2. The Bayesian approach offers a coherent framework for parameter
inference that can account for multiple sources of uncertainty, while making
use of prior information. It offers a rigorous methodology for parameter
inference, as well as modelling the link between unobservable model states and
parameters, and observable quantities. 3. We present deBInfer, a package for
the statistical computing environment R, implementing a Bayesian framework for
parameter inference in DEs. deBInfer provides templates for the DE model, the
observation model and data likelihood, and the model parameters and their prior
distributions. A Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) procedure processes these
inputs to estimate the posterior distributions of the parameters and any
derived quantities, including the model trajectories. Further functionality is
provided to facilitate MCMC diagnostics, the visualisation of the posterior
distributions of model parameters and trajectories, and the use of compiled DE
models for improved computational performance. 4. The templating approach makes
deBInfer applicable to a wide range of DE models. We demonstrate its
application to ordinary and delay DE models for population ecology.

the presence of a background temperature gradient, $\Theta$, using a normal
mode analysis. The effect of $\Theta$ variation is examined for three interface
types corresponding to combinations of the viscous properties of the fluids
(inviscid-inviscid, viscous-viscous and viscous-inviscid) at different Atwood
numbers, $At$, and, when at least one of the fluids' viscosity is non-zero, as
a function of the Grashof number. For the general case, the resulting ordinary
differential equations are solved numerically; however, dispersion relations
for the growth rate are presented for several limiting cases. An analytical
solution is found for the inviscid-inviscid interface and the corresponding
dispersion equation for the growth rate is obtained in the limit of a large
$\Theta$. For the viscous-inviscid case, a dispersion relation is derived in
the incompressible limit and $\Theta=0$. Compared to $\Theta=0$ case, the role
of $\Theta<0$ (hotter light fluid) is destabilizing and becomes stabilizing
when $\Theta>0$ (colder light fluid). The most pronounced effect when
$\Theta\neq 0$ is found at low $At$ and/or at large perturbation wavelengths
relative to the domain size for all interface types. On the other hand, at
small perturbation wavelengths relative to the domain size, the growth rate for
$\Theta<0$ case exceeds the infinite domain incompressible constant density
result. The results are applied to two practical examples, using sets of
parameters relevant to Inertial Confinement Fusion coasting stage and solar
corona plumes. The role of viscosity on the growth rate reduction is discussed
together with highlighting the range of wavenumbers most affected by viscosity.
The viscous effects further increase in the presence of background temperature
gradient, when the viscosity is temperature dependent.

providing robust and accurate results by learning from annotated atlas

Segmentation methods requiring only a proportion of each atlas image to be
labelled could therefore reduce the workload on expert raters tasked with
annotating atlas images. To address this issue, we first re-examine the
labelling problem common in many existing approaches and formulate its solution
in terms of a Markov Random Field energy minimisation problem on a graph

multi-atlas segmentation. We then show how modifications in the graph
configuration of the proposed framework enable the use of partially annotated
atlas images and investigate different partial annotation strategies. The
proposed method was evaluated on two Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) datasets
for hippocampal and cardiac segmentation. Experiments were performed aimed at
(1) recreating existing segmentation techniques with the proposed framework and
(2) demonstrating the potential of employing sparsely annotated atlas data for
multi-atlas segmentation.

revised, expanded or eventually refuted using experimental and other means.
Theoretical biology used to primarily provide a basis to rationally examine the
frameworks within which biological experiments were carried out and to shed
light on overlooked gaps in understanding. Today, however, theoretical biology
has generally become synonymous with computational and mathematical biology.
This could in part be explained by a relatively recent tendency in which a
""data first"", rather than a ""theory first"", approach is preferred. Moreover,
generating hypotheses has at times become procedural rather than theoretical.
This situation leaves our understanding enmeshed in data, which should be
disentangled from much noise. Given the many unresolved questions in biology
and medicine, it seems apt to revive the role of pure theory in the biological
sciences. This paper makes the case for a ""philosophical biology""
(philbiology), distinct from but quite complementary to philosophy of biology
(philobiology), which would entail biological investigation through
philosophical approaches. Philbiology would thus be a reincarnation of
theoretical biology, adopting the true sense of the word ""theory"" and making
use of a rich tradition of serious philosophical approaches in the natural
sciences. A philbiological investigation, after clearly defining a given
biological problem, would aim to propose a set of empirical questions, along
with a class of possible solutions, about that problem. Importantly, whether or
not the questions can be tested using current experimental paradigms would be
secondary to whether the questions are inherently empirical or not. The final
goal of a philbiological investigation would be to develop a theoretical
framework that can lead observational and/or interventional experimental
studies of the defined problem.

identical atoms in two dimensions interacting via the idealized pair potential
$V(r)=+\infty$ if $r<1$, $-1$ if $r=1$, $0$ if $r>1$. This is done by endowing
the bond graph of a general particle configuration with a suitable notion of
{\it discrete curvature}, and appealing to a {\it discrete Gauss-Bonnet
theorem} (O. Knill, Elem. Math. 67, 1-17, 2012) which, as its continuous
cousins, relates the sum/integral of the curvature to topological invariants.
This leads to an exact geometric decomposition of the Heitmann-Radin energy
into (i) a combinatorial bulk term, (ii) a combinatorial perimeter, (iii) a
multiple of the Euler characteristic, and (iv) a natural topological energy
contribution due to defects. An analogous exact geometric decomposition is also
established for soft potentials such as the Lennard-Jones potential
$V(r)=r^{-6}-2r^{-12}$, where two additional contributions arise, (v) elastic
energy and (vi) energy due to non-bonded interactions.

$B-L$ asymmetry may therefore be generated in the early universe, potentially
providing a baryogenesis mechanism through the Standard Model (SM) sphaleron

to electroweak symmetry breaking, thereby accounting for the proximity of the
mass scales of the SM Higgs and the exo-Higgs. Our model can be distinguished

perfect fluid source in arbitrary dimension is studied. A systematic analysis
is performed for the case that the theory does not admit maximally symmetric
solutions. Considering two independent scale factors, namely one for the three
dimensional space and one for the extra dimensional space, is found that a
regime exists where the two scale factors tend to a constant value via damped
oscillations for not too negative pressure of the fluid, so that asymptotically
the evolution of the $(3+1)$-dimensional Friedmann model with perfect fluid is
recovered. At last, it is worth emphasizing that the present numerical results
strongly support a 't Hooft-like interpretation of the parameter $1/D$ (where
$D$ is the number of extra dimensions) as a small expansion parameter in very
much the same way as it happens in the large $N$ expansion of gauge theories
with $1/N$. Indeed, the dependence on $D$ of many of the relevant physical
quantities computed here manifests a clear WKB-like pattern, as expected on the

interconnect bottleneck is dominating integrated circuit (IC) power and
performance. While 3D IC technologies using Through Silicon Via or Monolithic
Inter-layer Via alleviate some of these challenges, they follow a similar
layout and routing mindset as 2D CMOS. This is insufficient to address routing
requirements in high-density 3D ICs and even causes severe routing congestion
at large-scale designs, limiting their benefits and scalability. Skybridge is a
recently proposed fine-grained 3D IC fabric relying on vertical nanowires that
presents a paradigm shift for scaling, while addressing associated 3D
connectivity and manufacturability challenges. Skybridge's core fabric
components enable a new 3D IC design approach with vertically-composed logic
gates, and provide a greater degree of routing flexibility compared to
conventional 2D and 3D ICs leading to much larger benefits and future
scalability. In this paper, we present a methodology using relevant metrics to
evaluate and quantify the benefits of Skybridge vs. state-of-the-art
transistor-level monolithic 3D IC (T-MI) and 2D in terms of routability and its
impact on large-scale circuits. This is enabled by a new device-to-system
design flow with commercial CAD tools that we developed for large-scale
Skybridge IC designs in 16nm node. Evaluation for standard benchmark circuits
shows that Skybridge yields up to 1.6x lower routing demand against T-MI with
no routing congestion (routing demand to resource ratio < 1) at all metal
layers. This 3D routability in conjunction with compact vertical gate design in
Skybridge translate into benefits of up to 3x lower power and 11x higher

to fluxes fainter than 1 mJy and 0.2 mJy at 450 $\mu$m and 850 $\mu$m,

background light (EBL) at each wavelength is contributed by faint sources with
$L_{\rm IR} < 10^{12} L_{\odot }$, corresponding to luminous infrared galaxies
(LIRGs) or normal galaxies. By comparing our result with the 500 $\mu$m
stacking of $K$-selected sources from the literature, we conclude that the
$K$-selected LIRGs and normal galaxies still cannot fully account for the EBL
that originates from sources with $L_{\rm IR} < 10^{12} L_{\odot }$. This
suggests that many faint submillimeter galaxies may not be included in the UV

the two bands for our 450 $\mu$m and 850 $\mu$m selected sources. At 850

This relation can be explained by a redshift evolution, where galaxies at

contrast, at 450 $\mu$m, we do not see a clear relation between the flux ratio

(UD-SCNs) will need to combat a variety of challenges. On one hand, massive
number of devices sharing the limited wireless resources will render
centralized control mechanisms infeasible due to the excessive cost of
information acquisition and computations. On the other hand, to reduce energy
consumption from fixed power grid and/or battery, many IoT devices may need to
depend on the energy harvested from the ambient environment (e.g., from RF
transmissions, environmental sources). However, due to the opportunistic nature
of energy harvesting, this will introduce uncertainty in the network operation.
In this article, we study the distributed cell association problem for energy

particularly suitable to analyze large multi-agent systems under uncertainty

phenomena: given a uniformly random instance of a CSP with $n$ variables and
$m$ clauses, there is a value of $m = \Omega(n)$ beyond which the CSP will be
unsatisfiable with high probability. Strong refutation is the problem of
certifying that no variable assignment satisfies more than a constant fraction
of clauses; this is the natural algorithmic problem in the unsatisfiable regime
(when $m/n = \omega(1)$).
  Intuitively, strong refutation should become easier as the clause density
$m/n$ grows, because the contradictions introduced by the random clauses become
more locally apparent. For CSPs such as $k$-SAT and $k$-XOR, there is a
long-standing gap between the clause density at which efficient strong
refutation algorithms are known, $m/n \ge \widetilde O(n^{k/2-1})$, and the
clause density at which instances become unsatisfiable with high probability,
$m/n = \omega (1)$.
  In this paper, we give spectral and sum-of-squares algorithms for strongly
refuting random $k$-XOR instances with clause density $m/n \ge \widetilde
O(n^{(k/2-1)(1-\delta)})$ in time $\exp(\widetilde O(n^{\delta}))$ or in
$\widetilde O(n^{\delta})$ rounds of the sum-of-squares hierarchy, for any
$\delta \in [0,1)$ and any integer $k \ge 3$. Our algorithms provide a smooth
transition between the clause density at which polynomial-time algorithms are
known at $\delta = 0$, and brute-force refutation at the satisfiability
threshold when $\delta = 1$. We also leverage our $k$-XOR results to obtain
strong refutation algorithms for SAT (or any other Boolean CSP) at similar
clause densities. Our algorithms match the known sum-of-squares lower bounds
due to Grigoriev and Schonebeck, up to logarithmic factors.
  Additionally, we extend our techniques to give new results for certifying
upper bounds on the injective tensor norm of random tensors.

knowledge bases, web graphs, etc. is now available for analysis and mining.
Graph-mining often involves 'relationship queries', which seek a ranked list of
interesting interconnections among a given set of entities, corresponding to
nodes in the graph. While relationship queries have been studied for many
years, using various terminologies, e.g., keyword-search, Steiner-tree in a
graph etc., the solutions proposed in the literature so far have not focused on
scaling relationship queries to large graphs having billions of nodes and
edges, such are now publicly available in the form of 'linked-open-data'. In
this paper, we present an algorithm for distributed keyword search (DKS) on
large graphs, based on the graph-parallel computing paradigm Pregel. We also
present an analytical proof that our algorithm produces an optimally ranked
list of answers if run to completion. Even if terminated early, our algorithm
produces approximate answers along with bounds. We describe an optimized
implementation of our DKS algorithm along with time-complexity analysis.
Finally, we report and analyze experiments using an implementation of DKS on
Giraph the graph-parallel computing framework based on Pregel, and demonstrate
that we can efficiently process relationship queries on large-scale subsets of
linked-open-data.

  arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:1503.05412",,,,"hep-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In this talk, I describe a class of electroweak (EW) scale dark matter (DM)
models where its stability or longevity are the results of underlying dark
gauge symmetries: stable due to unbroken local dark gauge symmetry or topology,
or long-lived due to the accidental global symmetry of dark gauge theories.
Compared with the usual phenomenological dark matter models (including DM EFT
or simplified DM models), DM models with local dark gauge symmetries include
dark gauge bosons, dark Higgs bosons and sometimes excited dark matter. And
dynamics among these fields are completely fixed by local gauge principle. The
idea of singlet portals including the Higgs portal can thermalize these hidden
sector dark matter very efficiently, so that these DM could be easily thermal
DM. I also discuss the limitation of the usual DM effective field theory or
simplified DM models without the full SM gauge symmetry, and emphasize the
importance of the full SM gauge symmetry and renormalizability especially for
collider searches for DM.

kinematics where the two jets are well separated in rapidity. The partonic
processes are dominated by the t-channel weak boson fusion (WBF) and gluon
fusion (GF) contributions. We derive the associated QCD resummation formalism
for the correlation analysis where the total transverse momentum q_\perp of the
Higgs boson and two jets is small. Because of different color structures, the
resummation results lead to distinguished behaviors: the WBF contribution peaks
at relative low q_\perp while all GF channel contributions are strongly
de-correlated and spread to a much wider q_\perp range. By applying a kinematic
cut on q_\perp, one can effectively increase the WBF signal to the GF
background by a significant factor. This greatly strengthens the ability to
investigate the WBF channel in Higgs boson production and study the couplings
of Higgs to electroweak bosons.

learned using the back-propagation through time method. HORNNs are generally
applicable to a variety of sequence modelling tasks. In this work, we have
examined HORNNs for the language modeling task using two popular data sets,

advantage of this method is that the explicit forms of the spacetime metric,
black hole mass and charge are not needed but the Hawking temperature and
entropy formula on the horizons are necessary for static black holes, while our
calculations require the expressions of metric and angular velocity formula. We
find that the entropy sum is always independent of angular momentum for all
dimensions and the angular momentum-independence of entropy product only holds
for the dimensions $d>4$ with at least one rotation parameter $a_i=0$, while
the mass-free of entropy sum and entropy product for rotating black holes only
stand for higher dimensions ($d>4$) and for all dimensions, respectively. On
the other hand, we find that the introduction of a negative cosmological
constant does not affect the angular momentum-free of entropy sum and product
but the criterion for angular momentum-independence of entropy product will be
affected.

processing, image analysis, and statistics. The correct choice of the
regularization parameter $ t \in \mathbb{R}_{\geq 0} $ is a delicate issue.
Instead of solving the variational problem for a fixed parameter, the idea of
the homotopy method is to compute a complete solution path $ u(t) $ as a
function of $ t $. In a celebrated paper by Osborne, Presnell, and Turlach, it
has been shown that the computational cost of this approach is often comparable
to the cost of solving the corresponding least squares problem. Their analysis
relies on the one-at-a-time condition, which requires that different indices
enter or leave the support of the solution at distinct regularization
parameters. In this paper, we introduce a generalized homotopy algorithm based
on a nonnegative least squares problem, which does not require such a
condition, and prove its termination after finitely many steps. At every point
of the path, we give a full characterization of all possible directions. To
illustrate our results, we discuss examples in which the standard homotopy
method either fails or becomes infeasible. To the best of our knowledge, our
algorithm is the first to provably compute a full solution path for an
arbitrary combination of an input matrix and a data vector.

free braids of $n$-stands. In~\cite{KiMa} Manturov and the author studied an
invariant valued in free groups not only for free braids but also for free
tangles, which is derived from the group $G_{n}^{2}$. On the other hands,
in~\cite{FeMa} Manturov and Fedoseev studied groups $Br_{2}^{n}$ of virtual
braids with parity and groups $Br_{d}^{n}$ of virtual braids with dots. They
showed that there is a monomorphism from $Br_{2}^{n}$ to $Br_{d}^{n}$ and it is
deduced that a parity of the braid can be represented by a geometric object,
dots on strands. In this paper we study $G_{n}^{2}$ with structures, which are
corresponded to parity and points on a braid, which are denoted by
$G_{n,p}^{2}$ and $G_{n,d}^{2}$, respectively. In section 3, it is proved that
there is a monomorphism from $G_{n}^{2}$ to $G_{n,p}^{2}$ and that there is a
monomorphism from $G_{n,p}^{2}$ to $G_{n,d}^{2}$. By the homomorphism from
$G_{n}^{2}$ to $G_{n,p}^{2}$, it can be deduced that a given parity of a braid
has geometric representation, which is the number of points on the braid. In
section 4, it can be proved that for each element $\beta$ in $G_{n,d}^{2}$, an
element in $G_{n+1}^{2}$ obtained by adding another strand by tracing points on
$\beta$. That is, a parity of free braid of $n$-stands is represented not only
by points on strands, but also by an $n+1$-th strand. Conversely, for a braid
of $n+1$-strands, a braid of $n$-strands is obtained by deleting one strand of
the braid of $n+1$-strand. Finally, we will simply discuss about the way to

capturing the same scene in the grayscale target image). Unlike the previous
methods, this paper aims at a high-quality fully-automatic colorization method.
With the assumption of a perfect patch matching technique, the use of an
extremely large-scale reference database (that contains sufficient color
images) is the most reliable solution to the colorization problem. However,
patch matching noise will increase with respect to the size of the reference
database in practice. Inspired by the recent success in deep learning
techniques which provide amazing modeling of large-scale data, this paper
re-formulates the colorization problem so that deep learning techniques can be
directly employed. To ensure artifact-free quality, a joint bilateral filtering
based post-processing step is proposed. We further develop an adaptive image
clustering technique to incorporate the global image information. Numerous
experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms the state-of-art algorithms

framework for cooperative wireless networking that takes into account both
social relationships and physical coupling among users. We show that this
framework provides rich modeling flexibility and spans the continuum between
non-cooperative game and network utility maximization (NUM) -- two
traditionally disjoint paradigms for network optimization. Based on this
framework, we study three important applications of SGUM, in database assisted
spectrum access, power control, and random access control, respectively. For
the case of database assisted spectrum access, we show that the SGUM game is a
potential game and always admits a socially-aware Nash equilibrium (SNE). We
develop a randomized distributed spectrum access algorithm that can
asymptotically converge to the optimal SNE, derive upper bounds on the
convergence time, and also quantify the trade-off between the performance and
convergence time of the algorithm. We further show that the performance gap of
SNE by the algorithm from the NUM solution decreases as the strength of social
ties among users increases and the performance gap is zero when the strengths
of social ties among users reach the maximum values. For the cases of power
control and random access control, we show that there exists a unique SNE.
Furthermore, as the strength of social ties increases from the minimum to the
maximum, a player's SNE strategy migrates from the Nash equilibrium strategy in
a standard non-cooperative game to the socially-optimal strategy in network
utility maximization. Furthermore, we show that the SGUM framework can be
generalized to take into account both positive and negative social ties among

worked out disregarding the non-Gaussianity of fluctuations. This reveals how
the aforementioned non-linear interaction operates in short coherent

phenomenon of dynamical Coulomb blockade but they also modify their internal
density of states leading to an additional electrostatic modification of the

magnitude increases in capacity for next-generation cellular wireless systems.
However, links in mmWave networks are highly susceptible to blocking and may
suffer from rapid variations in quality. Connectivity to multiple cells - both
in the mmWave and in the traditional lower frequencies - is thus considered
essential for robust connectivity. However, one of the challenges in supporting
multi-connectivity in the mmWave space is the requirement for the network to
track the direction of each link in addition to its power and timing. With
highly directional beams and fast varying channels, this directional tracking
may be the main bottleneck in realizing robust mmWave networks. To address this
challenge, this paper proposes a novel measurement system based on (i) the UE
transmitting sounding signals in directions that sweep the angular space, (ii)
the mmWave cells measuring the instantaneous received signal strength along
with its variance to better capture the dynamics and, consequently, the
reliability of a channel/direction and, finally, (iii) a centralized controller
making handover and scheduling decisions based on the mmWave cell reports and
transmitting the decisions either via a mmWave cell or conventional microwave

coefficient have been reported in many single-particle-tracking experiments,
though origins of these behaviors are still elusive. Here, as a model to
describe such phenomena, we investigate a Langevin equation with diffusivity
fluctuating between a fast and a slow state. We assume that the sojourn time
distributions of these two states are given by power laws. It is shown that,
for a non-equilibrium ensemble, the ensemble-averaged mean square displacement
(MSD) shows transient subdiffusion. In contrast, the time-averaged MSD shows
normal diffusion, but an effective diffusion coefficient transiently shows
aging behavior. The propagator is non-Gaussian for short time, and converges to
a Gaussian distribution in a long time limit; this convergence to Gaussian is
extremely slow for some parameter values. For equilibrium ensembles, both
ensemble-averaged and time-averaged MSDs show only normal diffusion, and thus
we cannot detect any traces of the fluctuating diffusivity with these MSDs.
Therefore, as an alternative approach to characterize the fluctuating
diffusivity, the relative standard deviation (RSD) of the time-averaged MSD is
utilized, and it is shown that the RSD exhibits slow relaxation as a signature
of the long-time correlation in the fluctuating diffusivity. Furthermore, it is
shown that the RSD is related to a non-Gaussian parameter of the propagator. To
obtain these theoretical results, we develop a two-state renewal theory as an
analytical tool.

effectively upgrade the links through the process of purification. Here we
perform the most detailed analysis to date on this purification task, using a
protocol which is balanced to maximise fidelity while minimising the device
complexity and the time cost of the process. Moreover we 'compile down' the

an entire zone rather than differentiating one ion from its neighbour. To
evaluate the capabilities of such a module we consider its use both as a
universal communications node for quantum key distribution, and as the basic
repeating unit of a quantum computer. For the latter case we evaluate the

mechanics of tubular crystals with variable tube radius, with dislocations
interposed between regions of different phyllotactic packings. Unbinding and
separation of dislocation pairs with equal and opposite Burgers vectors allow
the growth of one phyllotactic domain at the expense of another. In particular,
glide separation of dislocations offers a low-energy mode for plastic
deformations of solid tubes in response to external stresses, reconfiguring the
lattice step by step. Through theory and simulation, we examine how the tube's
radius and helicity affects, and is in turn altered by, the mechanics of

hundred eigenfunctions associated with an unstable time-periodic single-spiral

adjoint eigenfunctions are exponentially localized in the vicinity of the
spiral tip, although the marginal modes (response functions) demonstrate the
strongest localization. We also discuss the implications of the localization
for the dynamics and control of unstable spiral waves. In particular, the
interaction with no-flux boundaries leads to a drift of spiral waves which can
be understood with the help of the response functions.

Here we explore the possibility of such an anomaly in infra-red and Raman
spectroscopy of super-critical water (SCW) by varying the density across the
Widom line just above its critical temperature. Vibrational phase relaxation is
expected to be a sensitive probe of fluid dynamics. We carry out computer
simulations of two different model potentials (SPC/E and TIP4P/2005) to obtain
the necessary time correlation functions. An additional feature of this work is
a quantum chemical calculation of the anharmonicity parameter that largely
controls frequency fluctuations. We find a sharp rise in the vibrational
relaxation rate (or the line widths) for both the models as we travel across
the Widom line. The rise is noticeably less sharp in water than in nitrogen. We
attribute this difference to the faster relaxation rate in water. We
demonstrate that the anomalous rise is due to sharp increase in the mean square
frequency fluctuation and not due to any dynamical critical slowing down
because the time constant of the normalized frequency-frequency time
correlation functions show lack of any noticeable change as we move across the

vergence in variation of the Bernstein-Durrmeyer modifications of the classical
Bernstein operators in the space of functions of bounded variation. These
problems are studied with respect to the variation seminorm. Moreover we also
study the problem of the rate of approximation.

  logic","17 pages, 11 figures",,,,"physics.chem-ph q-bio.BM","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  This paper gives a systematic method for constructing an N-body potential,
approximating the true potential, that accurately captures meso-scale behavior
of the chemical or biological system using pairwise potentials coming from
experimental data or ab initio methods. The meso-scale behavior is translated
into logic rules for the dynamics. Each pairwise potential has an associated
logic function that is constructed using the logic rules, a class of elementary
logic functions, and AND, OR, and NOT gates. The effect of each logic function
is to turn its associated potential on and off. The N-body potential is
constructed as linear combination of the pairwise potentials, where the
""coefficients"" of the potentials are smoothed versions of the associated logic
functions. These potentials allow a potentially low-dimensional description of
complex processes while still accurately capturing the relevant physics at the
meso-scale. We present the proposed formalism to construct coarse-grained
potential models for three examples: an inhibitor molecular system, bond
breaking in chemical reactions, and DNA transcription from biology. The method
can potentially be used in reverse for design of molecular processes by
specifying properties of molecules that can carry them out.
