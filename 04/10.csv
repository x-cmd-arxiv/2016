re-analyze two topical experiments, avoiding (i) {\it ad hoc} core-repulsion
models, (ii) ""Yukawa screening"" models and (iii) electron-ion equilibrium
assumptions. An accurate, rapid density-functional neutral-pseudoatom model
coupled to a hyper-netted-chain (HNC) equation with a bridge term is used to
compute structure factors, X-Ray scattering, compressibility, phonons and
resistivity. Electronic-structure codes are used to confirm the calculations.
The Yukawa and core-repulsion models are shown to be misleading.

""computation-friendly"" hypothesis testing via Convex Programming. Most of the
existing results on hypothesis testing aim to quantify in a closed analytic
form separation between sets of distributions allowing for reliable decision in
precisely stated observation models. In contrast to this descriptive (and
highly instructive) traditional framework, the approach we promote here can be
qualified as operational -- the testing routines and their risks are yielded by
an efficient computation. All we know in advance is that, under favorable
circumstances, specified in [GJN], the risk of such test, whether high or low,
is provably near-optimal under the circumstances. As a compensation for the
lack of ""explanatory power,"" this approach is applicable to a much wider family
of observation schemes and hypotheses to be tested than those where ""closed
form descriptive analysis"" is possible.
  In the present paper our primary emphasis is on computation: we make a step
further in extending the principal tool developed in the cited paper -- testing
routines based on affine detectors -- to a large variety of testing problems.
The price of this development is the loss of blanket near-optimality of the
proposed procedures (though it is still preserved in the observation schemes
studied in [GJN], which now become particular cases of the general setting
considered here).

Anna Trevisan and co-authors, the error covariance matrix is asymptotically
supported by the unstable-neutral subspace only, i.e., it is spanned by the
backward Lyapunov vectors with non-negative exponents. This behavior is at the
core of algorithms known as Assimilation in the Unstable Subspace, although a
formal proof was still missing.
  This paper provides the analytical proof of the convergence of the Kalman
filter covariance matrix onto the unstable-neutral subspace when the dynamics
and the observation operator are linear and when the dynamical model is
error-free, for any, possibly rank-deficient, initial error covariance matrix.
The rate of convergence is provided as well. The derivation is based on an
expression that explicitly relates the error covariances at an arbitrary time
to the initial ones. It is also shown that if the unstable and neutral
directions of the model are sufficiently observed and if the column space of
the initial covariance matrix has a non-zero projection onto all of the forward
Lyapunov vectors associated with the unstable and neutral directions of the
dynamics, the covariance matrix of the Kalman filter collapses onto an
asymptotic sequence which is independent of the initial covariances. Numerical
results are also shown to illustrate and support the theoretical findings.

fermions interact via a repulsive, isotropic dipolar interaction. The presence
of a second layer introduces an attractive {\em interlayer} interaction,
thereby allowing for inhomogeneous density phases which would otherwise be
energetically unfavourable. For any fixed layer separation, we find an
instability to a commensurate one-dimensional stripe phase in each layer, which
always precedes the formation of a triangular Wigner crystal. However, at a
certain {\em fixed} coupling, tuning the separation can lead to the system
favoring a commensurate triangular Wigner crystal, or one-dimensional stripe
phase, completely bypassing the Fermi liquid state. While other crystalline
symmetries, with energies lower than the liquid phase can be found, they are
never allowed to form owing to their high energetic cost relative to the
triangular Wigner crystal and stripe phase.

problem of prime theoretical and practical importance. Here we theoretically
study its dependence on the loading rate, the age (history) of the glass and
the notch radius $\rho$. Reduced-dimensionality analysis suggests that the
notch fracture toughness results from a competition between the initial, age-
and history-dependent, plastic relaxation timescale $\tau^{pl}_0$ and an
effective loading timescale $\tau^{ext}(\dot{K}_I,\rho)$, where $\dot{K}_I$ is
the tensile stress-intensity-factor rate. The toughness is predicted to scale
with $\sqrt{\rho}$ independently of $\xi\!\equiv\!\tau^{ext}\!/\tau^{pl}_0$ for
$\xi\!\ll\! 1$, to scale as $T\sqrt{\rho}\,\log(\xi)$ for $\xi\!\gg\!1$
(related to thermal activation, where $T$ is the temperature) and to feature a
non-monotonic behavior in the crossover region $\xi\!\sim\!{\cal O}(1)$
(related to plastic yielding dynamics). These predictions are verified using
novel 2D computations, providing a unified picture of the notch fracture
toughness of glasses. The theory highlights the importance of timescales
competition and far from steady-state elasto-viscoplastic dynamics for
understanding the toughness, and shows that the latter varies quite
significantly with the glass age (history) and applied loading rate.
Experimental support for bulk metallic glasses is presented.

between the initial wavefunctions. This ratio is equal to $\beta=2/(1+I^2)$ ,
where $I$ is the overlap integral between the initial wavefunctions. That is,
only when the initial wavefunctions are orthogonal this ratio is equal to 2,
however, this bunching ratio can be reduced to 1, when the two wavefunctions
are identical. This simple equation explains the experimental evidences of a
beam splitter. A straightforward conclusion is that by measuring the local
bunching parameter $\beta$ (at any point in space and time) it is possible to
evaluate a global parameter$ I$ (the overlap between the initial
wavefunctions). The bunching parameter is then generalized to arbitrary number
of particles, and in an analogy to the two-particles scenario, the well-known
bosonic enhancement appears only when all states are orthogonal.

be adopted by the fifth generation (5G) cellular networks. FD communication
renders the entire spectrum simultaneously accessible by uplink and downlink,
and hence, is optimistically promoted to double the transmission rate. While
this is true for a single communication link, cross-mode interference (i.e.,
interference between uplink and downlink) may diminish the full-duplexing gain.
This paper studies FD operation in large-scale cellular networks with real base
stations (BSs) locations and 3GPP propagation environment. The results show
that the uplink is the bottleneck for FD operation due to the overwhelming
cross-mode interference from BSs. Operating uplink and downlink on a common set
of channels in an FD fashion improves the downlink rate but significantly
degrades (over 1000-fold) the uplink rate. Therefore, we propose the
$\alpha$-duplex scheme to balance the tradeoff between the uplink and downlink
rates via adjustable partial overlap between uplink and downlink channels. The
$\alpha$-duplex scheme can provide a simultaneous $30\%$ improvement in each of
the uplink and downlink rates. To this end, we discuss the backward
compatibility of the $\alpha$-duplex scheme with half-duplex user-terminals.
Finally, we point out future research directions for FD enabled cellular
networks.

important in the study of cancer evolution, as sequencing is often performed on
bulk tumor tissue containing mixed populations of cells. Recent work has shown
how to reconstruct a perfect phylogeny tree from samples that contain mixtures
of two-state characters, where each character/locus is either mutated or not.
However, most cancers contain more complex mutations, such as copy-number
aberrations, that exhibit more than two states. We formulate the Multi-State
Perfect Phylogeny Mixture Deconvolution Problem of reconstructing a multi-state
perfect phylogeny tree given mixtures of the leaves of the tree. We
characterize the solutions of this problem as a restricted class of spanning
trees in a graph constructed from the input data, and prove that the problem is
NP-complete. We derive an algorithm to enumerate such trees in the important
special case of cladisitic characters, where the ordering of the states of each
character is given. We apply our algorithm to simulated data and to two cancer
datasets. On simulated data, we find that for a small number of samples, the
Multi-State Perfect Phylogeny Mixture Deconvolution Problem often has many
solutions, but that this ambiguity declines quickly as the number of samples
increases. On real data, we recover copy-neutral loss of heterozygosity,
single-copy amplification and single-copy deletion events, as well as their
interactions with single-nucleotide variants.

optical properties of mantle phases. Optical properties of mantle minerals at
high pressure are accessible through diamond anvil cell experiments, but
because of the extensive thermal radiation at T above 1000 K such studies are
limited to lower temperatures. Particularly uncertain is the
temperature-dependence of optical properties of lower mantle minerals across
the spin transition as the spin state itself is a strong function of
temperature. Here we use laser-heated DACs combined with a pulsed bright
supercontinuum laser probe and a synchronized time-gated detector to examine
optical properties of high and low spin ferrous iron at 45-73 GPa and to 1600 K
in FeO6, one of the most abundant building blocks in the mantle. Siderite
(FeCO3) is used as a model for FeO6-octahedra as it contains no ferric iron and
exhibits a sharp optically apparent spin transition at 44 GPa, simplifying data
interpretation. We find that the optical absorbance of low spin FeO6 is
substantially increased at 1000-1200 K due to the partially lifted Laporte
selection rule. The temperature-induced low to high spin transition, however,
results in a dramatic drop in absorbance of the FeO6-unit. The absorption edge
(Fe-O charge transfer) red-shifts (~ 1 cm-1/K) with increasing temperature and
at T above 1600 K becomes the dominant absorption mechanism in the visible
range, suppressing radiative conductivity. This implies that the radiative
conductivity of analogous FeO6-bearing minerals such as ferropericlase, the
second most abundant mineral in the Earths lower mantle, is substantially
reduced approaching the core-mantle boundary conditions. Finally, our results
emphasize that optical properties of mantle minerals probed at room temperature
are insufficient to model radiative thermal conductivity of planetary

explicit and implicit methods for integrating large stiff systems of
differential equations. Over the past decades these methods have been studied
theoretically and their performance was evaluated using a range of test
problems. While the results of these investigations showed that exponential
integrators can provide significant computational savings, the research on
validating this hypothesis for large scale systems and understanding what
classes of problems can particularly benefit from the use of the new techniques
is in its initial stages. Resistive magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) modeling is
widely used in studying large scale behavior of laboratory and astrophysical
plasmas. In many problems numerical solution of MHD equations is a challenging
task due to the temporal stiffness of this system in the parameter regimes of
interest. In this paper we evaluate the performance of exponential integrators
on large MHD problems and compare them to a state-of-the-art implicit time
integrator. Both the variable and constant time step exponential methods of
EpiRK-type are used to simulate magnetic reconnection and the Kelvin--Helmholtz
instability in plasma. Performance of these methods, which are part of the EPIC
software package, is compared to the variable time step variable order BDF
scheme included in the CVODE (part of SUNDIALS) library. We study performance
of the methods on parallel architectures and with respect to magnitudes of
important parameters such as Reynolds, Lundquist, and Prandtl numbers. We find
that the exponential integrators provide superior or equal performance in most
circumstances and conclude that further development of exponential methods for
MHD problems is warranted and can lead to significant computational advantages
for large scale stiff systems of differential equations such as MHD.

Regime switching has become an increasingly popular concept in many branches of
science. In finance, for instance, one could identify the background process
with the `state of the economy', to which asset prices react, or as an
identification of the varying default rate of an obligor. The key feature of
the counting processes in this paper is that their intensity processes are
functions of a finite state Markov chain. This kind of processes can be used to
model default events of some companies.
  Many quantities of interest in this paper, like conditional characteristic

principle, be analytically computed. We will also study limit results for
models with rapid switching, which occur when inflating the intensity matrix of
the Markov chain by a factor tending to infinity. The paper is largely

Chordal networks provide a computationally convenient decomposition into

compact chordal network representations (of size linear in the number of

Chordal networks can be computed for arbitrary polynomial systems using a
refinement of the chordal elimination algorithm from [Cifuentes-Parrilo-2016].
Furthermore, they can be effectively used to obtain several properties of the
variety, such as its dimension, cardinality, and equidimensional components, as
well as an efficient probabilistic test for radical ideal membership. We apply

t^{5}$, and $A_{n+8}= t^{8} A_{n} + t^{2} A_{n+2}$. A lemma, Proposition 4.3 of
[6], used to study the Hecke algebra attached to the space of mod $2$ level $1$
modular forms, gives information about the codes $(a,b)$ attached to the
monomials appearing in $A_{n}$. The unpublished highly technical proof has been
simplified by Gerbelli-Gauthier.
  Our Theorem 3.7 generalizes Proposition 4.3. The proof, in sections 1-3, is a
further simplification of Gerbelli-Gauthier's argument. We build up to the
theorem with variants involving the same recurrence, but having different sorts
of initial conditions.
  Section 4 treats the recurrence $A_{n+16}= t^{16} A_{n} + t^{4} A_{n+4} +
t^{2} A_{n+2}$. Theorem 4.1, the analog to Theorem 3.7 for this recurrence, is
used in [2] and [3] to analyze level 3 Hecke algebras.

bijection between $N\times N$ and those $w^{n}$, $n \equiv 1,3,7,9 \bmod{20}$,
in $Z/2[w]$. We then study the recurrence $A_{n+80}= w^{80} A_{n}+ w^{20}
A_{n+20}$, $n \equiv 1,3,7,9 \bmod{20}$, with appropriate initial conditions.
Lemma 5.5, derived from the results of sections 1-3, is the precise analog of
Proposition 4.3 for this code, this recurrence, and these initial conditions.

changes in the dynamics occur in two phase transitions. In a macroscopic
description one of these corresponds to a local bifurcation whereas the other
one corresponds to a non-local heteroclinic bifurcation. This model thus
provides a rare example of a system where a phase transition is caused by a
non-local bifurcation, while both micro- and macro-level dynamics are
accessible to mathematical analysis. The bifurcation points mark the onset of a
behaviour that we call network inoculation. In the respective parameter region
exposure of the system to a pathogen will lead to an outbreak that collapses,
but leaves the network in a configuration where the disease cannot reinvade,
despite every agent returning to the susceptible class. We argue that this
behaviour and the associated phase transitions can be expected to occur in a
wide class of models of sufficient complexity.

densification comes with a host of challenges that include compromised energy

burdensome signaling overheads and higher backhaul costs. Interestingly, most
of the problems, that beleaguer network densification, stem from legacy
networks' one common feature i.e., tight coupling between the control and data
planes regardless of their degree of heterogeneity and cell density.
Consequently, in wake of 5G, control and data planes separation architecture
(SARC) has recently been conceived as a promising paradigm that has potential
to address most of aforementioned challenges. In this article, we review
various proposals that have been presented in literature so far to enable SARC.
More specifically, we analyze how and to what degree various SARC proposals
address the four main challenges in network densification namely: energy
efficiency, system level capacity maximization, interference management and
mobility management. We then focus on two salient features of future cellular
networks that have not yet been adapted in legacy networks at wide scale and
thus remain a hallmark of 5G, i.e., coordinated multipoint (CoMP), and
device-to-device (D2D) communications. After providing necessary background on
CoMP and D2D, we analyze how SARC can particularly act as a major enabler for
CoMP and D2D in context of 5G. This article thus serves as both a tutorial as
well as an up to date survey on SARC, CoMP and D2D. Most importantly, the
article provides an extensive outlook of challenges and opportunities that lie
at the crossroads of these three mutually entangled emerging technologies.

We show that, in fact, there are countably infinite number of such unstable

the free surface boundary condition play a pivotal role, and the instability
does not obtain for a linearly-stratified fluid if a simplified boundary
condition such as rigid lid or linear form is employed. Harmonic-generation

internal waves are more prone to breaking, hence losing energy to turbulence

patch of seabed corrugations strongly depends on the ""distance"" of the patch to
adjacent seafloor features. Specifically, we consider the energy distribution
over a patch of seabed ripples neighbored to i. another patch of ripples, and
ii. a vertical wall. Seabed undulations with dominant wavenumber twice as large
as overpassing internal waves reflect back part of the energy of the internal
waves (Bragg reflection), let the rest of the energy to transmit or to be
transferred to higher and lower modes. In the presence of a neighboring
topography on the downstream side, the transmitted energy from the patch may
reflect back, e.g. partially if the downstream topography is another set of
seabed ripples, or fully if it is a vertical wall. The reflected wave from
downstream topography is again reflected back by the patch of ripples through
the same mechanism. This consecutive reflection goes on indefinitely leading to
a complex interaction pattern including constructive and destructive
interference of multiply reflected waves as well as an interplay between higher
modes internal waves resonated over the topography. We show here that when
steady state is reached both the qualitative and quantitative behavior of
energy distribution over the patch is a strong function of the ""distance""
between the patch and the downstream topography. As a result, for instance, the
local energy density in the water column can become an order of magnitude
larger in certain areas merely based on where the downstream topography is.
This may result in the formation of steep waves in specific areas of the ocean,
leading to breaking and enhanced mixing. At a right distance, the wall or the
second patch may also result in a complete disappearance of the trace of the
seabed undulations on the upstream and the downstream wave field.

capture through explicit semantic segmentation in the RGB input. To ensure
robustness, cutting edge supervised learning approaches rely on large training
datasets of face images captured in the wild. While impressive tracking quality
has been demonstrated for faces that are largely visible, any occlusion due to
hair, accessories, or hand-to-face gestures would result in significant visual
artifacts and loss of tracking accuracy. The modeling of occlusions has been
mostly avoided due to its immense space of appearance variability. To address
this curse of high dimensionality, we perform tracking in unconstrained images
assuming non-face regions can be fully masked out. Along with recent
breakthroughs in deep learning, we demonstrate that pixel-level facial
segmentation is possible in real-time by repurposing convolutional neural
networks designed originally for general semantic segmentation. We develop an
efficient architecture based on a two-stream deconvolution network with
complementary characteristics, and introduce carefully designed training
samples and data augmentation strategies for improved segmentation accuracy and
robustness. We adopt a state-of-the-art regression-based facial tracking
framework with segmented face images as training, and demonstrate accurate and
uninterrupted facial performance capture in the presence of extreme occlusion
and even side views. Furthermore, the resulting segmentation can be directly
used to composite partial 3D face models on the input images and enable
seamless facial manipulation tasks, such as virtual make-up or face
replacement.

ultraviolet missions, the V1 and V2 UVS calibration with other spectrometers
are invaluable. Here we revisit the UVS calibration to assess the intriguing
243 % (V1) and 156 % (V2) sensitivity enhancements recently proposed. Using the
Saturn Lyman-$\alpha$ airglow, observed in-situ by both Voyagers, and remotely
by IUE, we match the Voyager values to IUE, taking into account the shape of
the Saturn Lyman-$\alpha$ line observed with the Goddard High Resolution
Spectrograph onboard the Hubble Space Telescope. For all known ranges of the
interplanetary hydrogen density, we show that the V1 and V2 UVS sensitivities
cannot be enhanced by the amounts thus far proposed. The same diagnostic holds
for distinct channels covering the diffuse HeI 58.4 nm emission. Our
prescription is to keep the original calibration of the Voyager UVS with a
maximum uncertainty of 30 %, making both instruments some of the most stable
EUV/FUV spectrographs of the history of space exploration. In that frame, we
reassess the Lyman-$\alpha$ emission excess detected by Voyager UVS deep in the
heliosphere, to show its consistency with the heliospheric but not the galactic
origin. Our finding confirms results obtained nearly two decades ago--namely,
the UVS discovery of the heliosphere distortion and the corresponding local
interstellar magnetic field's obliquity ($\sim40^{\circ}$ from upwind) in the

signals. In order to cope with the sampling rate bottleneck, new sampling
methods have been proposed that sample below the Nyquist rate. However, such
techniques decrease the signal to noise ratio (SNR), deteriorating the
performance of subsequent energy detection. Cyclostationary detection, which
exploits the periodic property of communication signal statistics, absent in
stationary noise, is a natural candidate for this setting. In this work, we
consider cyclic spectrum recovery from sub-Nyquist samples, in order to achieve
both efficiency and robustness to noise. To that end, we propose a structured
compressed sensing algorithm, that extends orthogonal matching pursuit to
account for the structure imposed by cyclostationarity. Next, we derive a lower
bound on the sampling rate required for perfect cyclic spectrum recovery in the
presence of stationary noise and show that it can be reconstructed from samples
obtained below Nyquist, without any sparsity constraints on the signal. In
particular, in non sparse settings, the cyclic spectrum can be recovered at
$4/5$ of the Nyquist rate. If the signal of interest is sparse, then the
sampling rate may be further reduced to $8/5$ of the Landau rate. Once the
cyclic spectrum is recovered, we estimate the number of transmissions that
compose the input signal, along with their carrier frequencies and bandwidths.
Simulations show that cyclostationary detection outperforms energy detection in
low SNRs in the sub-Nyquist regime. This was already known in the Nyquist
regime, but is even more pronounced at sub-Nyquist sampling rates.

noise. Here we present an analysis of the Vela pulsar spanning nearly 21 yr of
observation and including 8 glitches. We identify the relative pulse number of
all of the observations between glitches, with the only pulse-number
ambiguities existing over glitch events. We use the phase coherence of the
timing solution to simultaneously model the timing noise and glitches in a
Bayesian framework, allowing us to select preferred models for both. We find
the glitches can be described using only permanent and transient changes in
spin frequency, i.e., no step changes in frequency derivative. For all of the
glitches, we only need two exponentially decaying changes in spin frequency to
model the transient components. In contrast to previous studies, we find that
the dominant transient components decay on a common $\approx$ 1300 d time
scale, and that a larger fraction ( $\gtrsim 25\%$) of glitch amplitudes are
associated with these transient components. We also detect shorter-duration
transient components of $\approx$ 25 d, as previously observed, but are limited
in sensitivity to events with shorter durations by the cadence of our
observations. The timing noise is well described by a steep power-law process
that is independent of the glitches and subdominant to the glitch recovery. The
braking index is constrained to be $<$ 8 with 95% confidence. This methodology
can be used to robustly measure the properties of glitches and timing noise in

investigating a spring-mass oscillator submerged in quiescent fluid subject to
periodic changes in its volume. We develop an analytical model to investigate
the relationship between added-mass variation and viscous damping and
demonstrate its range of application with fully coupled fluid-solid
Navier-Stokes simulations at large Stokes number. Our results demonstrate that
the recovery of added-mass kinetic energy can be used to completely cancel the
viscous damping of the fluid, driving the onset of sustained oscillations with

relationship is found to link the terminal amplitude of the oscillations $X$,

  Approximation to System-Level Analysis of Cellular Networks","Submitted for Journal Publication",,,,"cs.IT math.IT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The intensity matching approach for tractable performance evaluation and
optimization of cellular networks is introduced. It assumes that the base
stations are modeled as points of a Poisson point process and leverages
stochastic geometry for system-level analysis. Its rationale relies on
observing that system-level performance is determined by the intensity measure
of transformations of the underlaying spatial Poisson point process. By
approximating the original system model with a simplified one, whose
performance is determined by a mathematically convenient intensity measure,
tractable yet accurate integral expressions for computing area spectral
efficiency and potential throughput are provided. The considered system model
accounts for many practical aspects that, for tractability, are typically
neglected, e.g., line-of-sight and non-line-of-sight propagation, antenna
radiation patterns, traffic load, practical cell associations, general fading
channels. The proposed approach, more importantly, is conveniently formulated
for unveiling the impact of several system parameters, e.g., the density of
base stations and blockages. The effectiveness of this novel and general
methodology is validated with the aid of empirical data for the locations of
base stations and for the footprints of buildings in dense urban environments.

When combined with coherence measurements on Rayleigh scattered photons, our

spacelike slice of the asymptotically anti-de Sitter bulk is two-dimensional de
Sitter space (dS$_2$), with a metric that can be derived from the entanglement
entropy of intervals in the CFT. In the second proposal, de Sitter dynamics
emerges naturally from the first law of entanglement entropy for perturbations
around the vacuum state of CFTs. We provide support for the equivalence of
these two emergent spacetimes in the vacuum case and beyond. In particular, we
study the kinematic spaces of nontrivial solutions of $3$d gravity, including
the BTZ black string, BTZ black hole, and conical singularities. We argue that
the resulting spaces are generically globally hyperbolic spacetimes that
support dynamics given boundary conditions at future infinity. For the BTZ
black string, corresponding to a thermal state of the CFT, we show that both
prescriptions lead to an emergent hyperbolic patch of dS$_2$. We offer a
general method for relating kinematic space and the auxiliary de Sitter space
that is valid in the vacuum and thermal cases.

oscillatory form that changes significantly depending on the initial state,
system size and the spatial anisotropy. The oscillatory behavior is suppressed
once the system is coupled to the environment. Furthermore, the asymptotic
behavior of the entanglement, nearest neighbor and beyond, in the system under
the influence of the environment at zero temperature is very sensitive to the
x-y spatial anisotropy, which causes them to reach either a zero or a finite
sustainable steady state value regardless of the initial state of the system.
The anisotropy in the $z-$direction may enhance the entanglement depending on
the interplay with the magnetic field applied in the same direction. As the
temperature is raised, the steady state of the short range entanglements is
found to be robust within very small non-zero temperature range, which depends
critically on the spatial anisotropy of the system. The entanglement at each

assess planetary atmospheric structure and composition with greater certainty.
Chapter 1 gives a short introduction. Chapter 2 presents the Spitzer
secondary-eclipse analysis and atmospheric characterization of WASP-14b.
WASP-14b is a highly irradiated, transiting hot Jupiter. By applying a Bayesian
approach in the atmospheric analysis, we found an absence of thermal inversion
contrary to theoretical predictions. Chapter 3 describes the infrared
observations of WASP-43b Spitzer secondary eclipses, data analysis, and
atmospheric characterization. WASP-43b is one of the closest-orbiting hot
Jupiters, orbiting one of the coolest stars with a hot Jupiter. The atmospheric
analysis ruled out a strong thermal inversion in its dayside atmosphere.
Chapter 4 presents an open-source Thermochemical Equilibrium Abundances (TEA)
code and its application to several hot Jupiters. TEA calculates the abundances
of gaseous species using the Gibbs free-energy minimization method within an
iterative Lagrangian optimization scheme. The code is written in Python and
available to the community via http://github.com/dzesmin/TEA. Chapter 5
presents my contributions to an open-source Bayesian Atmospheric Radiative
Transfer (BART) code, and its application to WASP-43b. BART characterizes
planetary atmospheres based on the observed spectroscopic information. It
initializes a planetary atmospheric model, performs radiative-transfer
calculations to produce models of planetary spectra, and using a statistical
module compares models with observations.

important notion in sociology and related research. The problem of measuring
social status has been studied for many years. Various indicators are proposed
to assess social status of individuals, including educational attainment,
occupation, and income/wealth. However, these indicators are sometimes
difficult to collect or measure.
  We investigate social networks for alternative measures of social status.
Online activities expose certain traits of users in the real world. We are
interested in how these activities are related to social status, and how social
status can be predicted with social network data. To the best of our knowledge,
this is the first study on connecting online activities with social status in
reality.
  In particular, we focus on the network structure of microblogs in this study.
A user following another implies some kind of status. We cast the predicted
social status of users to the ""status"" of real-world entities, e.g.,
universities, occupations, and regions, so that we can compare and validate
predicted results with facts in the real world. We propose an efficient
algorithm for this task and evaluate it on a dataset consisting of 3.4 million
users from Sina Weibo. The result shows that it is possible to predict social
status with reasonable accuracy using social network data. We also point out
challenges and limitations of this approach, e.g., inconsistence between online
popularity and real-world status for certain users. Our findings provide
insights on analyzing online social status and future designs of ranking

The conductance and I-V curves have different characteristics in the distinct
stages of elastic deformation that characterize the elongation of these

strongly reduced in the small elongation stage, whereas in the large elongation
regime the development of strong, localized pseudomagnetic field barriers can
reinforce the coupling and reestablish resonant tunneling across the kirigami.
This provides an interesting example of interplay between geometry and
pseudomagnetic field-induced confinement. The alternating miniband and
stop-gaps in the transmission lead to I-V characteristics with negative
differential conductance in well defined energy/doping ranges. These effects
should be stable in a realistic scenario that includes edge roughness and
Coulomb interactions, as these are expected to further promote localization of

  longer than 1,920 characters"", the abstract appearing here is slightly
  shorter than the one in the PDF file",,,,"q-bio.QM q-bio.GN","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Metagenomic binning is an essential task in analyzing metagenomic sequence
datasets. To analyze structure or function of microbial communities from
environmental samples, metagenomic sequence fragments are assigned to their
taxonomic origins. Although sequence alignment algorithms can readily be used
and usually provide high-resolution alignments and accurate binning results,
the computational cost of such alignment-based methods becomes prohibitive as
metagenomic datasets continue to grow. Alternative compositional-based methods,
which exploit sequence composition by profiling local short k-mers in
fragments, are often faster but less accurate than alignment-based methods.
Inspired by the success of linear error correcting codes in noisy channel
communication, we introduce Opal, a fast and accurate novel compositional-based
binning method. It incorporates ideas from Gallager's low-density parity-check
code to design a family of compact and discriminative locality-sensitive
hashing functions that encode long-range compositional dependencies in long
fragments. By incorporating the Gallager LSH functions as features in a simple
linear SVM, Opal provides fast, accurate and robust binning for datasets
consisting of a large number of species, even with mutations and sequencing
errors. Opal not only performs up to two orders of magnitude faster than BWA,
an alignment-based binning method, but also achieves improved binning accuracy
and robustness to sequencing errors. Opal also outperforms models built on
traditional k-mer profiles in terms of robustness and accuracy. Finally, we
demonstrate that we can effectively use Opal in the ""coarse search"" stage of a
compressive genomics pipeline to identify a much smaller candidate set of
taxonomic origins for a subsequent alignment-based method to analyze, thus
providing metagenomic binning with high scalability, high accuracy and high
resolution.

This suggests that similar success could be achieved for direct estimation of

the security of a multi-antenna wireless communication system employing M-PSK
modulation to convey information. The directional modulation method operates by
steering the array beam in such a way that the phase of the received signal at
the receiver matches that of the intended M-PSK symbol. Due to the difference
between the channels of the legitimate receiver and the eavesdropper, the
signals received by the eavesdropper generally encompass a phase component
different than the actual symbols. As a result, the transceiver which employs
directional modulation can impose a high symbol error rate on the eavesdropper
without requiring to know the eavesdropper's channel. The optimal directional
modulation beamformer is designed to minimize the consumed power subject to
satisfying a specific resulting phase and minimal signal amplitude at each

directional modulation results in a much higher symbol error rate at the
eavesdropper compared to the conventional benchmark scheme, i.e., zero-forcing

tree of a flow graph with $n$ vertices through a sequence of $k$ edge
insertions in $O(m\min\{n,k\}+kn)$ time, where $m$ is the total number of edges
after all insertions. Moreover, we can test in constant time if a vertex $u$
dominates a vertex $v$, for any pair of query vertices $u$ and $v$. Next, we
present a new decremental algorithm to update a dominator tree through a
sequence of edge deletions. Although our new decremental algorithm is not
asymptotically faster than repeated applications of a static algorithm, i.e.,
it runs in $O(mk)$ time for $k$ edge deletions, it performs well in practice.

and a modified Korteweg-de Vries equation (mKdV) with a quartic nonlinear term.
The conclusions about its one-soliton solution and integrability will also be
valid for more complicated plasma compositions. Only three polynomial
conservation laws can be obtained. The mKdV equation with quartic nonlinearity
is not completely integrable, thus precluding the existence of multi-soliton
solutions. Next, the full Sagdeev pseudopotential method has been applied and
this allows for a detailed comparison with the reductive perturbation results.
This comparison shows that the mKdV solitons have slightly larger amplitudes

only slightly superacoustic mKdV solitons have acceptable amplitudes and
widths, in the light of the full solutions.

the distribution of the magnetic flux in active regions (sunspots and faculae)

ephemeral regions is accounted for separately based on the concept of extended
cycles whose length and amplitude are linked to those of the sunspot cycles
through the sunspot number. The magnetic flux in each surface component
(sunspots, faculae and network, and ephemeral regions) was used to compute the
spectral and total solar irradiance between the years 1700 and 2009. This
reconstruction is aimed at timescales of months or longer although the model

relevant observations such as the total magnetic flux, reconstructs the total
solar irradiance (TSI) on timescales of months or longer in good agreement with

microbial communities, despite insufficient sequencing depths to detect all
rare taxa. These low abundance taxa are not accounted for in existing methods
for detecting changes in species richness. We address this with a new
hierarchical model that permits rigorous testing for both heterogeneity and
biodiversity changes, and simultaneously improves Type I & II error rates
compared to existing methods.
