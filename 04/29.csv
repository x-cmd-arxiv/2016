resolution optical spectroscopy. However, we can obtain a more reliable
estimate of their total Galactic population by using all available signatures
of the symbiotic phenomenon. Here we report the discovery of a hard X-ray
source, 4PBC J0642.9+5528, in the Swift hard X-ray all-sky survey, and identify
it with a poorly studied red giant, SU Lyn, using pointed Swift observations
and ground-based optical spectroscopy. The X-ray spectrum, the optical to UV
spectrum, and the rapid UV variability of SU Lyn are all consistent with our
interpretation that it is a symbiotic star containing an accreting white dwarf.
The symbiotic nature of SU Lyn went unnoticed until now, because it does not
exhibit emission lines strong enough to be obvious in low resolution spectra.
We argue that symbiotic stars without shell-burning have weak emission lines,
and that the current lists of symbiotic stars are biased in favor of
shell-burning systems. We conclude that the true population of symbiotic stars
has been underestimated, potentially by a large factor.

multi-threading is effective in hiding the data latencies. We have also

is developed in this paper to study available ocean current energy potentials
harnessed by using the ocean current turbines. Power extraction is modeled by
adding a parameterized Rayleigh friction term in the barotropic vorticity
equation. Numerical assessments are performed by simulating a set of
mid-latitude ocean basins in the beta plane, which are standard prototypes of
more realistic ocean dynamics considering inter-decadal variability in
turbulent equilibrium. A sensitivity analysis with respect to the turbine
parameters is performed for various physical conditions. Results show that the
proposed model captures the quasi-stationary ocean dynamics and provides the
four-gyre circulation patterns in time mean. After an initial spin-up process,
the proposed model reaches a statistically steady state at an average maximum
speed between 1.5 m/s and 2.5 m/s, which is close to the observed maximum zonal
velocities in the western boundary currents. The probability density function
of the available power over a long time period is computed for a wide range of
parameters. Numerical results shows that 10 GW mean power can be extracted from
the turbines distributed over a length scale of 100 km along the western
boundaries. However, it is demonstrated that bigger turbine areas would alter
the flow patterns and energetics due to excessive dissipation. An increase in
the turbine area results in an increase in the available power ranging from 8
to 22 GW depending on the values of turbine modeling parameters. This first
step in the numerical assessment of the proposed QG model shows that the
present framework could represent a viable tool for evaluating energy
potentials in a highly turbulent flow regime.

can be maintained in general graphs with logarithmic amortized update time.
More specifically, starting from an empty graph on $n$ fixed vertices, they
devised a randomized algorithm for maintaining maximal matching over any
sequence of $t$ edge insertions and deletions with a total runtime of $O(t \log
n)$ in expectation and $O(t \log n + n \log^2 n)$ with high probability.
Whether or not this runtime bound can be improved towards $O(t)$ has remained
an important open problem. Despite significant research efforts, this question
has resisted numerous attempts at resolution even for basic graph families such
as forests.
  In this paper, we resolve the question in the affirmative, by presenting a
randomized algorithm for maintaining maximal matching in general graphs with
\emph{constant} amortized update time. The optimal runtime bound $O(t)$ of our
algorithm holds both in expectation and with high probability.
  As an immediate corollary, we can maintain 2-approximate vertex cover with
constant amortized update time. This result is essentially the best one can
hope for (under the unique games conjecture) in the context of dynamic
approximate vertex cover, culminating a long line of research.
  Our algorithm builds on Baswana et al.'s algorithm, but is inherently
different and arguably simpler. As an implication of our simplified approach,
the space usage of our algorithm is linear in the (dynamic) graph size, while
the space usage of Baswana et al.'s algorithm is always at least $\Omega(n \log
n)$.
  Finally, we present applications to approximate weighted matchings and to
distributed networks.

one reflecting boundary. The particle type defines the hopping direction. When
only particles hopping towards the open end are allowed to change lane, the
system exhibits a phase transition from a low density phase to a pulsing phase
depending on the ratio between particle injection and type-changing rate. This
phase transition can be observed in the stochastic model as well as in a
mean-field description. In the low density phase, the density profile can be
predicted analytically. The pulsing phase is characterised by a fast filling of
the system and - once filled - by a slowly backwards moving front separating a
decreasing dense region and an expanding low density region. The hopping of the
front on the discrete lattice is found to create density oscillations, both, in
time and space. By means of a stability analysis we can predict the structure
of the dense region during the emptying process, characterised by exponentially
damped perturbations, both at the open end and near the moving front.

drug-resistant epilepsy that patient-specific virtual brain models derived from
diffusion MRI have sufficient predictive power to improve diagnosis and surgery
outcome. In partial epilepsy, seizures originate in a local network, the
so-called epileptogenic zone, before recruiting other close or distant brain
regions. We create personalized large-scale brain networks for 15 patients and
simulate the individual seizure propagation patterns. Model validation is
performed against the presurgical stereotactic electroencephalography (SEEG)

propagation patterns and explain the variability in postsurgical success. Our
results show that individual variations in structural connectivity, when linked

three-dimensional density of electrons $n(x)$ in such a layer decays with the
distance from the surface $x$ very slowly as $n(x) \propto 1/x^{12/7}$. We show
that when the mobility is limited by the surface scattering the contribution of
such a tail to the conductivity diverges at large $x$ because of growing time
electrons need to reach the surface. We explore truncation of this divergence
by the finite sample width, by the bulk scattering rate, or by the crossover to
the bulk linear dielectric response with the dielectric constant $\kappa$. As a
result we arrive at the anomalously large mobility, which depends not only on
the rate of the surface scattering, but also on the physics of truncation.
Similar anomalous behavior is found for the Hall factor, the magnetoresistance,
and the thermopower.

the Kondo peak, a narrow feature in the electronic response function arising
from the screening of a magnetic impurity by the conduction electrons. After a
quench, the electronic screening builds up on timescales shorter than the
inverse width of the Kondo peak and we demonstrate that the proposed
experimental scheme could be used to measure the intrinsic time scales of such
electronic screening. The proposed approach provides an experimental framework
to access the nonequilibrium response of collective electronic properties
beyond the spectral uncertainty limit and will enable the direct measurement of
phenomena such as excited Higgs modes and, possibly, the retarded interactions

presence of light moduli leads to a late-time period of matter domination which
lowers the required number of e-foldings and, in turn, modifies the exact
predictions of any inflationary model. In this paper we compute exactly the
shift of the number of e-foldings in Kaehler moduli inflation which is
determined by the magnitude of the moduli initial displacement caused by vacuum
misalignment and the moduli decay rates. We find that the preferred number of
e-foldings gets reduced from 50 to 45, causing a modification of the spectral
index at the percent level. Our results illustrate the importance of
understanding the full post-inflationary evolution of the universe in order to
derive precise predictions in string inflation. To perform this task it is
crucial to work in a setting where there is good control over moduli

orientations in global magnetospheric simulations. This has heretofore not been
practical because it is difficult to locate where reconnection occurs for
oblique IMF, but new techniques make this possible. The approach is to identify
magnetic separators, the curves separating four regions of differing magnetic
topology, which map the reconnection X-line. The electric field parallel to the
X-line is the local reconnection rate. We compare results to a simple model of
local two-dimensional asymmetric reconnection. To do so, we find the plasma
parameters that locally drive reconnection in the magnetosheath and
magnetosphere in planes perpendicular to the X-line at a large number of points
along the X-line. The global magnetohydrodynamic simulations are from the
three-dimensional Block-Adaptive, Tree Solarwind Roe-type Upwind Scheme
(BATS-R-US) code with a uniform resistivity, although the techniques described
here are extensible to any global magnetospheric simulation model. We find that
the predicted local reconnection rates scale well with the measured values for
all simulations, being nearly exact for due southward IMF. However, the
absolute predictions differ by an undetermined constant of proportionality,
whose magnitude increases as the IMF clock angle changes from southward to
northward. We also show similar scaling agreement in a simulation with oblique
southward IMF and a dipole tilt. The present results will be an important
component of a full understanding of the local and global properties of dayside

physicists and philosophers have mused about the `spooky action at a distance'
aspect of quantum mechanics that so bothered Einstein. In his formal analysis
of EPR-type entangled quantum states, Bell (1964) concluded that any hidden
variable theory designed to reproduce the predictions of quantum mechanics must
necessarily be nonlocal and allow superluminal interactions. This doesn't
immediately imply that nonlocality is a characteristic feature of quantum
mechanics let alone a fundamental property of nature; however, many physicists
and philosophers of science do harbor this belief. Experts in the field often
use the term `nonlocality' to designate particular non-classical aspects of
quantum entanglement and do not confuse the term with superluminal
interactions. However, many physicists seem to take the term more literally. I
endeavor to disabuse the latter of this notion by emphasizing that the
correlations of Bell-type entanglement are a result of ordinary quantum
superposition with no need to introduce nonlocality. The conclusion of the EPR
paper wasn't that quantum mechanics is nonlocal but rather that it is an
incomplete description of reality. For different reasons, many physicists,
including me, agree with Einstein that quantum mechanics is necessarily an
incomplete description of reality.

the wind launching and explore the orbital/fluid dynamics of the resulting
flows in detail. In particular we find that a combination of the tidal and
Coriolis forces strongly distorts the planetary ""Parker"" wind creating
""up-orbit"" and ""down-orbit"" streams. We characterize the flows in terms of
their orbital elements which change depending on their launch position on the
planet. We find that the anisotropy in the atmospheric temperature leads to
significant backflow on to the planet. The planetary wind interacts strongly
with the stellar wind creating instabilities that cause eventual deposition of
planetary gas onto the star. We present synthetic observations of both transit
and absorption line-structure for our simulations. For our initial conditions,
we find that the orbiting wind material produces absorption signatures at
significant distances from the planet and substantial orbit to orbit
variability. Ly-{\alpha} absorption shows red and blueshifted features out to
70 km/s. Finally, using semi-analytic models we constrain the effect of
radiation pressure, given the approximation of uniform stellar absorption.

disorder, in presence of non-local interactions, the Integrated Density of
States (IDS) is at least H\""older continuous in one dimension and universally
infinitely differentiable in higher dimensions. This result applies also to the
IDS in any finite volume subject to the random potential induced by an ambient,
infinitely extended disordered media. Dimension one is critical: in the
Bernoulli case, within the class of exponential interactions, the IDS measure
undergoes continuity phase transitions, from absolutely continuous to singular
continuous behaviour (the singularity in the latter case was known before). The
continuity transitions do not occur for sub-exponential or slower decaying
interactions, nor for $d\ge 2$. Technically, the case of polynomial decay is
the simplest one.
  The proposed approach provides a complement to the classical Wegner estimate
which says, essentially, that the IDS in the short-range models is at least as
regular as the marginal distribution of the disorder. In the models with
non-local interaction the IDS is actually much more regular than the underlying
disorder, which can even be discrete, due to the smoothing effect of multiple
convolutions. In turn, smoothness of the IDS is responsable for a mechanism
complementing the usual Lifshitz tails phenomenon.
  It is also shown that the disorder can take various forms (e.g., substitution
or random displacements) and need not be stochastically stationary (as in
Delone--Anderson or trim\-med/crooked Hamiltonians, for example); this does not
affect the main phenomena observed already in the simplest setting.
  Long-range models have an amazingly large number of connections to several
classical problems of harmonic analysis, probability theory, dynamical systems

  Approach","7 pages, 7 figures, ICC 2016",,,,"cs.NI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Cellular operators are continuously densifying their networks to cope with
the ever-increasing capacity demand. Furthermore, an extreme densification
phase for cellular networks is foreseen to fulfill the ambitious fifth
generation (5G) performance requirements. Network densification improves
spectrum utilization and network capacity by shrinking base stations' (BSs)
footprints and reusing the same spectrum more frequently over the spatial
domain. However, network densification also increases the handover (HO) rate,
which may diminish the capacity gains for mobile users due to HO delays. In
highly dense 5G cellular networks, HO delays may neutralize or even negate the
gains offered by network densification. In this paper, we present an analytical
paradigm, based on stochastic geometry, to quantify the effect of HO delay on
the average user rate in cellular networks. To this end, we propose a flexible
handover scheme to reduce HO delay in case of highly dense cellular networks.
This scheme allows skipping the HO procedure with some BSs along users'
trajectories. The performance evaluation and testing of this scheme for only
single HO skipping shows considerable gains in many practical scenarios.

directed and undirected graphs, which significantly outperforms all previous
approaches on real-world complex networks. The efficiency of the new algorithm
relies on two new theoretical contributions, of independent interest. The first
contribution focuses on sampling shortest paths, a subroutine used by most
algorithms that approximate betweenness centrality. We show that, on realistic
random graph models, we can perform this task in time $|E|^{\frac{1}{2}+o(1)}$
with high probability, obtaining a significant speedup with respect to the
$\Theta(|E|)$ worst-case performance. We experimentally show that this new
technique achieves similar speedups on real-world complex networks, as well.
The second contribution is a new rigorous application of the adaptive sampling
technique. This approach decreases the total number of shortest paths that need
to be sampled to compute all betweenness centralities with a given absolute
error, and it also handles more general problems, such as computing the $k$
most central nodes. Furthermore, our analysis is general, and it might be
extended to other settings.

T_J for individual test particles is not always a reliable indicator of initial

comet-like starting elements (i.e., similar to Jupiter-family comets) reach
main-belt-like orbits (at least temporarily) during our 2 Myr integrations,
even without the inclusion of non-gravitational forces, apparently via a
combination of gravitational interactions with the terrestrial planets and
temporary trapping by mean-motion resonances with Jupiter. We estimate that the
fraction of real Jupiter-family comets occasionally reaching main-belt-like
orbits on Myr timescales could be on the order of ~0.1-1%, although the
fraction that remain on such orbits for appreciable lengths of time is
certainly far lower. Thus, the number of JFC-like interlopers in the main-belt
population at any given time is likely to be small, but still non-zero, a
finding with significant implications for efforts to use main-belt comets to
trace the primordial distribution of volatile material in the inner solar

transition onto main-belt-like orbits in our integrations appear to be largely
prevented from reaching low eccentricity, low inclination orbits. We therefore
find that low-eccentricity, low-inclination main-belt comets may provide a more

accelerators is collective instabilities, which can be suppressed by a spread
of betatron frequencies (tunes) through the Landau damping mechanism or by an
external damper, if the instability is slow enough. The spread is usually
created by octupole magnets, which introduce the tune dependence on the
amplitude and, in some cases, by a chromatic spread (tune dependence on
particle's momentum). The introduction of octupoles usually has both the
beneficial (improved Landau damping) and harmful properties, such as a resonant
behavior and a reduction of the dynamic aperture. One of the research goals at
the IOTA ring is to achieve a large betatron tune spread, while retaining a
large dynamic aperture, using conventional octupole magnets in a special but
realistic accelerator configuration. In this paper, we present results of
computer simulations of an electron beam in the IOTA by particle tracking and

key physical mechanisms that drive the dissipation of the kinetic energy of
tidal flows in their interiors and the evolution of their systems. This
friction acts both on the equilibrium/non-wave like tide and on tidal inertial
waves in these layers. It is thus necessary to obtain a robust prescription for
this friction. In the current state-of-the-art, it is modeled by a turbulent
eddy-viscosity coefficient, based on mixing-length theory, applied on
velocities of tides. However, none of the current prescriptions take into
account the action of rotation that can strongly affects turbulent convection.
Therefore, we use theoretical scaling laws for convective velocities and
characteristic lengthscales in rotating stars and planets that have been
recently confirmed by 3-D high-resolution nonlinear Cartesian numerical
simulations to derive a new prescription. A corresponding local model of tidal
waves is used to understand the consequences for the linear tidal dissipation.
Finally, new grids of rotating stellar models and published values of planetary
convective Rossby numbers are used to discuss astrophysical consequences. The
action of rotation on convection deeply modifies the turbulent friction applied
on tides. In the regime of rapid rotation (with a convective Rossby number
below 0.25), the eddy-viscosity may be decreased by several ordres of
magnitude. It may lead to a loss of efficiency of the viscous dissipation of
the equilibrium tide and to a more efficient complex and resonant dissipation
of tidal inertial waves in the bulk of convective regions. Therefore, it is
necessary to have a completely coupled treatment of the tidal/rotational
evolution of star-planet systems and multiple stars with a coherent treatment
of the variations of tidal flows and of their dissipation as a function of
rotation.

two sets of highly anisotropic Dirac fermions that interpenetrate each other
with negligible hybridization, and show a peculiar four-fold degeneracy where
their Dirac nodes overlap. Despite the lack of protection by crystalline or
time-reversal symmetries, this four-fold degeneracy is robust across magnetic
phase transitions. Comparison of these experimental findings with our
theoretical calculations suggests that the observed surface Dirac fermions
arise from bulk band inversions at an odd number of high-symmetry points, which
is analogous to the band topology which describes a

electromagnetic theory. The goal of the present paper is to define and
investigate stored energies that are valid for structures that can support both
electric and magnetic current densities. Stored energies normalized with the
dissipated power give us the Q factor, or antenna Q, for the structure. Lower
bounds of the Q factor provide information about the available bandwidth for
passive antennas that can be realized in the structure. The definition that we
propose is valid beyond the leading order small antenna limit. Our starting
point is the energy density with subtracted far-field form which we obtain an
explicit and numerically attractive current density representation. This
representation gives us the insight to propose a coordinate independent stored
energy. Furthermore, we find here that lower bounds on antenna Q for structures
with e.g. electric dipole radiation can be formulated as convex optimization
problems. We determine lower bounds on both open and closed surfaces that
support electric and magnetic current densities.
  The here derived representation of stored energies has in its electrical
small limit an associated Q factor that agrees with known small antenna bounds.
These stored energies have similarities to earlier efforts to define stored
energies. However, one of the advantages with this method is the above
mentioned formulation as convex optimization problems, which makes it easy to
predict lower bounds for antennas of arbitrary shapes. The present formulation
also gives us insight into the components that contribute to Chu's lower bound
for spherical shapes. We utilize scalar and vector potentials to obtain a
compact direct derivation of these stored energies. Examples and comparisons

possible. It is, though, an open question if this energy condition can be

violate the NEC without pathologies. We show that mimetic cosmology is prone to
gradient instabilities even in cases when the NEC is satisfied (except for
trivial examples). Most interestingly, the source of the instability is always
the Einstein-Hilbert term in the action. The matter stress-energy component

accretion onto a compact object. Possible explanations include accretion onto
neutron stars with strong magnetic fields, stellar-mass black holes (< 20

black holes (10^3-5 Msolar). The lack of sufficient energy resolution in
previous analyses has hitherto prevented an unambiguous identification of any
emission or absorption lines in the X-ray band, thereby precluding a detailed
analysis of the accretion flow. Here we report the presence of X-ray emission

stellar mass - halo mass relation, the one GC in this galaxy supports extending
the relationship between the number of GCs hosted by a galaxy and the galaxy's
total mass about two orders of magnitude in stellar mass below the previous
limit. For this empirically determined specific frequency of between 0.06 and
0.39 globular clusters per 10$^9$ $M_\odot$ of total mass, the surviving Milky
Way (MW) subhalos with masses smaller than $10^{10} M_\odot$ could host as many
as 5 to 31 GCs, broadly consistent with the actual population of outer halo MW
GCs, although matching the radial distribution in detail remains a challenge.
Using a subhalo mass function from published high resolution numerical
simulations and a Poissonian model for populating those halos with the
aforementioned empirically constrained frequency, we find that about 90$\%$ of
these GCs lie in lower-mass subhalos than that of Eri II. From what we know
about the stellar mass-halo mass function, the subhalo mass function, and the

Kennicutt-Schmidt (KS) relation. To understand the origin of this deficit, and
to investigate possible evolution with redshift and galaxy properties, we
measure the SFR efficiency of atomic gas at z~1, z~2, and z~3 around
star-forming galaxies. We use new robust photometric redshifts in the Hubble
Ultra Deep Field to create galaxy stacks in these three redshift bins, and
measure the SFR efficiency by combining DLA absorber statistics with the
observed rest-frame UV emission in the galaxies' outskirts. We find that the
SFR efficiency of HI gas at z>1 is ~1-3% of that predicted by the KS relation.
Contrary to simulations and models that predict a reduced SFR efficiency with
decreasing metallicity and thus with increasing redshift, we find no
significant evolution in the SFR efficiency with redshift. Our analysis instead
suggests that the reduced SFR efficiency is driven by the low molecular content
of this atomic-dominated phase, with metallicity playing a secondary effect in
regulating the conversion between atomic and molecular gas. This interpretation
is supported by the similarity between the observed SFR efficiency and that
observed in local atomic-dominated gas, such as in the outskirts of local

connects the continuum elasticity treatment of the long-range strain field
around a dislocation with an approximate treatment of the dislocation core, was
employed to calculate various core properties, including the core energetics,
widths, and Peierls stresses for different dislocation structures. The role of
core energetics and properties on dislocation character and subsequent slip
behavior in \beta-Sn was investigated. For instance, this work shows that a
widely spread dislocation core on the {110} plane as compared to dislocations
on the {100} and {101} planes. Physically, the narrowing or widening of the
core will significantly affect the mobility of dislocations as the Peierls
stress is exponentially related to the dislocation core width in \beta-Sn. In
general, the Peierls stress for the screw dislocation was found to be orders of
magnitude higher than the edge dislocation, i.e., the more the edge component
of a mixed dislocation, the greater the dislocation mobility (lower the Peierls
stress). The largest Peierls stress observed was 365 MPa for the dislocation on
the {101} plane. Furthermore, from the density plot, we see a double peak for
the 0deg (screw) and 30deg dislocations which suggests the dissociation of
dislocations along these planes. Thus, for the {101} <-101> slip system, we
observed dislocation dissociation into three partials with metastable states.
Overall, this work provides qualitative insights that aid in understanding the
plastic deformation in \beta-Sn.

stochastic differential equations (SDEs) by the spectrum of the stochastic

chaotic or non-chaotic by identifying the phenomenon of stochastic chaos with
the spontaneously broken topological supersymmetry that all SDEs possess. We
demonstrate the following three properties of the SEO, deduced previously
analytically and from physical arguments: the SEO spectra for zeroth and top
degree forms never break topological supersymmetry, all SDEs possesses
pseudo-time-reversal symmetry, and each de Rahm cohomology class provides one
supersymmetric eigenstate. Our results also suggests that the SEO spectra for
forms of complementary degrees, i.e., k and dim X -k, may be isospectral.

gravitational tidal forces begin stripping mass from the accreted subhalos.
This stripping eventually removes all mass beyond a subhalo's tidal radius, but
the unbound mass remains in the vicinity of the satellite for at least a
dynamical time t_dyn. The N-body subhalo study of Chamberlain et al. verified
this picture and pointed out a useful observational consequence: measurements
of subhalo correlations beyond the tidal radius are sensitive to the infall
time, t_infall, of the subhalo onto its host. We perform this cross-correlation
measurement using ~ 160,000 red satellite galaxies in SDSS redMaPPer clusters
and find evidence that subhalo correlations do persist well beyond the tidal
radius, suggesting that many of the observed satellites fell into their current
host less than a dynamical time ago, t_infall < t_dyn. Combined with estimated
dynamical times t_dyn ~ 3-5 Gyr and SED fitting results for the time at which
satellites stopped forming stars, t_quench ~ 6 Gyr, we infer that for a
significant fraction of the satellites, star formation quenched before those
satellites entered their current hosts. The result holds for red satellites
over a large range of cluster-centric distances 0.1 - 0.6 Mpc/h. We discuss the
implications of this result for models of galaxy formation.

predictions depend heavily on the treatment of inflow, outflow, star formation
efficiency (SFE), the stellar initial mass function, the Type Ia supernova
delay time distribution, stellar yields, and stellar population mixing. Using
flexCE, a flexible one-zone chemical evolution code, we investigate the effects
of and trade-offs between parameters. Two critical parameters are SFE and the
outflow mass-loading parameter, which shift the knee in [O/Fe]-[Fe/H] and the
equilibrium abundances that the simulations asymptotically approach,
respectively. One-zone models with simple star formation histories follow
narrow tracks in [O/Fe]-[Fe/H] unlike the observed bimodality (separate
high-alpha and low-alpha sequences) in this plane. A mix of one-zone models
with inflow timescale and outflow mass-loading parameter variations, motivated
by the inside-out galaxy formation scenario with radial mixing, reproduces the
two sequences better than a one-zone model with two infall epochs. We present
[X/Fe]-[Fe/H] tracks for 20 elements assuming three different supernova yield
models and find some significant discrepancies with solar neighborhood
observations, especially for elements with strongly metallicity-dependent
yields. We apply principal component abundance analysis (PCAA) to the
simulations and existing data to reveal the main correlations amongst
abundances and quantify their contributions to variation in abundance space.
For the stellar population mixing scenario, the abundances of alpha-elements
and elements with metallicity-dependent yields dominate the first and second
principal components, respectively, and collectively explain 99% of the
variance in the model. flexCE is a python package available at

to optimize any black-box function on a hyper-rectangular euclidean space. In
literature, pattern search technique has been shown to be a powerful tool for
blackbox optimization. The proposed algorithm follows the principle of pattern
search technique where new updated solution is obtained from the current
solution making movements (within the constrained sample space) along the
coordinates. Before making a jump from the current solution point to a new
solution point, objective function is evaluated in several neighborhood points
around the current solution and the best solution point is chosen based on the
objective function values at those points. Parallel threading can be used to
make the algorithm more scalable. Performance of the proposed method is
evaluated based on optimization of upto 5000 dimensional multi-modal benchmark
functions. The proposed algorithm is shown to perform upto 40 and 368 times
faster compared to Genetic Algorithm (GA) and Simulated Annealing (SA)

assigning VNF instances to nodes in the physical infrastructure (e.g., a

required by customers, a.k.a. SFCs) in the physical network. In doing so, the
provider must balance between various competing goals of performance and
resource usage. We present an approach for SFC provisioning, consisting of
three elements. The first element is a fast, scalable round-robin heuristic.
The second element is a Mixed Integer Programming (MIP) based approach. The
third element is a queueing-theoretic model to estimate the average latency
associated with any SFC provisioning solution. Combined, these elements create
an approach that generates a set of SFC provisioning solutions, reflecting

low-mass X-ray binary Serpens X-1 taken in 2013 October and 2014 April. The
observation was taken using the burst mode and only suffered mild pile-up
effects. A broad iron line is clearly detected in the X-ray spectrum. We test
different models and find that the iron line is asymmetric and best interpreted
by relativistic reflection. The relativistically broadened iron line is
generally believed to originate from the innermost regions of the accretion
disk, where strong gravity causes a series of special and general relativistic
effects. The iron line profile indicates an inner radius of $\sim8$ $R_{\rm
G}$, which gives an upper limit on the size of the neutron star. The asymmetric
iron line has been observed in a number of previous observations, which gives
several inner radius measurements at different flux states. We find that the
inner radius of Serpens X-1 does not evolve significantly over the range of
$L/L_{\rm Edd}\sim0.4-0.6$, and the lack of flux dependence of the inner radius
implies that the accretion disk may be truncated outside the innermost stable
circular orbit by the boundary layer rather than the stellar magnetic field.

PC217.96+32.3. We confirm that it is one of the largest and most overdense
high-redshift structures known. Such structures are rare even in the largest
cosmological simulations. We used the Mayall/MOSAIC1.1 imaging camera to image
a 1.2x0.6 deg area (~150x75 comoving Mpc) surrounding the protocluster's core
and discovered 165 candidate Lyman Alpha emitting galaxies (LAEs) and 788
candidate Lyman Break galaxies (LBGs). There are at least 2 overdense regions
traced by the LAEs, the largest of which shows an areal overdensity in its core
(i.e., within a radius of 2.5 comoving Mpc) of 14+/-7 relative to the average
LAE spatial density in the imaged field. Further, the average LAE spatial
density in the imaged field is twice that derived by other field LAE surveys.
Spectroscopy with Keck/DEIMOS yielded redshifts for 164 galaxies (79 LAEs and
85 LBGs); 65 lie at a redshift of 3.785+/-0.010. The velocity dispersion of
galaxies near the core is 350+/-40 km/s, a value robust to selection effects.
The overdensities are likely to collapse into systems with present-day masses
of >10^{15} solar masses and >6x10^{14} solar masses. The low velocity
dispersion may suggest a dynamically young protocluster. We find a weak trend
between narrow-band (Lyman Alpha) luminosity and environmental density: the
Lyman Alpha luminosity is enhanced on average by 1.35X within the protocluster
core. There is no evidence that the Lyman Alpha equivalent width depends on
environment. These suggest that star-formation and/or AGN activity is enhanced
in the higher density regions of the structure. PC217.96+32.3 is a Coma cluster
analog, witnessed in the process of formation.

can inhibit bud formation by a clathrin coat. In this study, we investigate the
impact of membrane tension on the mechanics of membrane budding by simulating
clathrin coats that either grow in area or progressively induce greater
curvature. At low membrane tension, progressively increasing the area of a
curvature-generating coat causes the membrane to smoothly evolve from a flat to
budded morphology, whereas the membrane remains essentially flat at high
membrane tensions. Interestingly, at physiologically relevant, intermediate
membrane tensions, the shape evolution of the membrane undergoes a snapthrough
instability in which increasing coat area causes the membrane to ""snap"" from an
open, U-shaped bud to a closed, $\Omega$-shaped bud. This instability is
accompanied by a large energy barrier, which could cause a developing endocytic
pit to stall if the binding energy of additional coat is insufficient to
overcome this barrier. Similar results were found for a coat of constant area
in which the spontaneous curvature progressively increases. Additionally, a
pulling force on the bud, simulating a force from actin polymerization, is
sufficient to drive a transition from an open to closed bud, overcoming the
energy barrier opposing this transition.

Black-box optimization is proposed over a simplex constrained parameter space.
At each iteration, starting from the current solution, new possible set of
solutions are found by adding a set of derived step-size vectors to the initial
starting point. While deriving these step-size vectors, precautions and
adjustments are considered so that the set of new possible solution points
still remain within the simplex constrained space. Thus, no extra time is spent
in evaluating the (possibly expensive) objective function at infeasible points
(points outside the unit-simplex space). While minimizing any objective
function of m parameters, within each iteration, the objective function is
evaluated at 2m new possible solution points. So, upto 2m parallel threads can
be incorporated which makes the computation even faster while optimizing
expensive objective functions over high-dimensional parameter space. Once a
local minimum is discovered, in order to find a better solution, a novel
`re-start' strategy is considered to increase the likelihood of finding a
better solution. Unlike existing pattern search based methods, a sparsity
control parameter is introduced which can be used to induce sparsity in the
solution in case the solution is expected to be sparse in prior. A comparative
study of the performances of the proposed algorithm and other existing
algorithms are shown for a few low, moderate and high-dimensional optimization
problems. Upto 338 folds improvement in computation time is achieved using the
proposed algorithm over Genetic algorithm along with better solution. The
proposed algorithm is used to estimate the simultaneous quantiles of North
Atlantic Hurricane velocities during 1981-2006 by maximizing a non-closed form
likelihood function with (possibly) multiple maximums.

the transient black hole GX 339-4 taken in January 2015. As the source softened
significantly over the course of the 1.3 d-long observation we split the data
into 21 sub-sets and find that the spectrum of all of them can be well
described by a power-law continuum with an additional relativistically blurred
reflection component. The photon index increases from ~1.69 to ~1.77 over the
course of the observation. The accretion disk is truncated at around 9
gravitational radii in all spectra. We also perform timing analysis on the same
21 individual data sets, and find a strong type-C quasi-periodic oscillation
(QPO), which increase in frequency from ~0.68 to ~1.05 Hz with time. The
frequency change is well correlated with the softening of the spectrum. We
discuss possible scenarios for the production of the QPO and calculate
predicted inner radii in the relativistic precession model as well as the
global disk mode oscillations model. We find discrepancies with respect to the
observed values in both models unless we allow for a black hole mass of ~100
M_sun , which is highly unlikely. We discuss possible systematic uncertainties,
in particular with the measurement of the inner accretion disk radius in the
relativistic reflection model. We conclude that the combination of observed QPO
frequencies and inner accretion disk radii, as obtained from spectral fitting,
is difficult to reconcile with current models.

achieved great improvements for crowd counting, how to improve the

Conventional holistic features used in crowd counting often fail to capture
semantic attributes and spatial cues of the image. In this paper, we propose
integrating semantic information into learning locality-aware feature sets for
accurate crowd counting. First, with the help of convolutional neural network
(CNN), the original pixel space is mapped onto a dense attribute feature map,
where each dimension of the pixel-wise feature indicates the probabilistic
strength of a certain semantic class. Then, locality-aware features (LAF) built
on the idea of spatial pyramids on neighboring patches are proposed to explore
more spatial context and local information. Finally, the traditional VLAD
encoding method is extended to a more generalized form in which diverse
coefficient weights are taken into consideration. Experimental results validate
the effectiveness of our presented method.

phase-space is thus comprised of highly non-local (hidden) variables
representing these bilinears, and the cost of the method is that it scales
quadratic rather than linear with system size. We demonstrate the strength of
the method by comparing the results to the exact quantum dynamics of fermion
expansion in the Hubbard model and quantum thermalization in the
Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) model for small systems, where the semiclassics nearly
perfectly reproduces correct results. We furthermore analyze fermion expansion
in a larger, intractable by exact methods, 2D Hubbard model, which is directly
relevant to recent cold atom experiments.

particular, we consider coherent large-scale motions in galaxy clusters to
estimate the level of anisotropy driven by stretching of the magnetic-field

estimate of the degree of polarization is $\sim 0.1 \%$ at energies $\gtrsim
kT$. While this value is too low for the forthcoming generation of X-ray
polarimeters, it is potentially an important proxy for the processes taking
place at extremely small scales, which are impossible to resolve spatially. The
absence of the effect at the predicted level may set a lower limit on the
electron collisionality in the ICM. At the same time, the small value of the
effect implies that it does not preclude the use of clusters as (unpolarized)
calibration sources for X-ray polarimeters at this level of accuracy.

WSe2 from becoming one of the competing channel materials for field-effect
transistors (FETs). Recent results have demonstrated that chemical treatments
can modify the electrical properties of transition metal dichalcogenides
(TMDCs) including MoS2 and WSe2. Here, we report that controlled heating in air
significantly improves device performance of WSe2 FETs in terms of on-state
currents and field-effect mobilities. Specifically, after heating at optimized
conditions, chemical vapor deposition grown monolayer WSe2 FETs showed an
average FET mobility of 31 cm2/Vs and on/off current ratios up to 5*108. For
few-layer WSe2 FETs, after the same treatment applied, we achieved a high
mobility up to 92 cm2/Vs. These values are significantly higher than FETs
fabricated using as-grown WSe2 flakes without heating treatment, demonstrating
the effectiveness of air heating on the performance improvements of WSe2 FETs.
The underlying chemical processes involved during air heating and the formation
of in-plane heterojunctions of WSe2 and WO3-x, which is believed to be the
reason for the improved FET performance, were studied by spectroscopy and
transmission electron microscopy. We further demonstrated that by combining air
heating method developed in this work with supporting 2D materials on BN
substrate, we achieved a noteworthy field effect mobility of 83 cm2/Vs for
monolayer WSe2 FETs. This work is a step towards controlled modification of the
properties of WSe2 and potentially other TMDCs, and may greatly improve device
performance for future applications of 2D materials in electronics and

an inner product defined by MA coefficients. We show the assumption of scalar
MA coefficients is not restrictive and this formulation of the VARMA model
shares many nice features of VAR and MA model. The gradient and Hessian could

stronger than the previous $n^{1-2/p}$ for small enough constant $\epsilon >

difficult task in computer vision, mostly due to the lack of 3D object
annotations in real images. Previous work tackles this problem by either
solving an optimization task given 2D keypoint positions, or training on
synthetic data with ground truth 3D information. In this work, we propose 3D
INterpreter Network (3D-INN), an end-to-end framework which sequentially
estimates 2D keypoint heatmaps and 3D object structure, trained on both real
2D-annotated images and synthetic 3D data. This is made possible mainly by two
technical innovations. First, we propose a Projection Layer, which projects
estimated 3D structure to 2D space, so that 3D-INN can be trained to predict 3D
structural parameters supervised by 2D annotations on real images. Second,
heatmaps of keypoints serve as an intermediate representation connecting real
and synthetic data, enabling 3D-INN to benefit from the variation and abundance
of synthetic 3D objects, without suffering from the difference between the
statistics of real and synthesized images due to imperfect rendering. The
network achieves state-of-the-art performance on both 2D keypoint estimation
and 3D structure recovery. We also show that the recovered 3D information can
be used in other vision applications, such as 3D rendering and image retrieval.

BiS2-based compounds where superconductivity develops from a
semiconducting-like normal state, the present compound exhibits a metallic
behavior down to Tc. Under weak magnetic field or pressure, however, a
remarkable crossover from metallic to insulating behaviors takes place around
Tmin where the resistivity picks up a local minimum. With increasing pressure,
Tc decreases monotonously and Tmin shifts to high temperatures, while the
absolute value of the normal state resistivity at low temperatures first
decreases and then increases with pressure up to 2.5 GPa. These results imply

macroscopic ensembles. The encoding that we use avoids the detrimental effects
of decoherence that normally plagues macroscopic implementations. We discuss
two mapping procedures which can be chosen depending upon the constraints of
the oracle and the experiment. Both methods have an exponential speedup over

graphlets) has recently attracted considerable attention. Despite recent
efforts on computing the number of instances a specific graphlet appears in a
large graph (i.e., the total number of CISes isomorphic to the graphlet),
little attention has been paid to characterizing a node's graphlet degree,
i.e., the number of CISes isomorphic to the graphlet that include the node,
which is an important metric for analyzing complex networks such as social and
biological networks. Similar to global graphlet counting, it is challenging to
compute node graphlet degrees for a large graph due to the combinatorial nature
of the problem. Unfortunately, previous methods of computing global graphlet
counts are not suited to solve this problem. In this paper we propose sampling
methods to estimate node graphlet degrees for undirected and directed graphs,
and analyze the error of our estimates. To the best of our knowledge, we are
the first to study this problem and give a fast scalable solution. We conduct
experiments on a variety of real-word datasets that demonstrate that our
methods accurately and efficiently estimate node graphlet degrees for graphs
with millions of edges.

associated with the structural plasticity of dendritic spines. Many of the
molecular mechanisms associated with transient spine enlargement have been
identified experimentally. Here, we use a systems biology approach to construct
a mathematical model of biochemical signaling and actin-mediated transient
spine expansion in response to calcium-influx due to NMDA receptor activation.
We have identified that a key feature of this signaling network is the
paradoxical signaling loop. Paradoxical components act bifunctionally in
signaling networks and their role is to control both the activation and
inhibition of a desired response function (protein activity or spine volume).
Using ordinary differential equation (ODE)-based modeling, we show that the
dynamics of different regulators of transient spine expansion including CaMKII,
RhoA, and Cdc42 and the spine volume can be described using paradoxical
signaling loops. Our model is able to capture the experimentally observed
dynamics of transient spine volume. Furthermore, we show that actin remodeling
events provide a robustness to spine volume dynamics. We also generate
experimentally testable predictions about the role of different components and
parameters of the network on spine dynamics.

according to a Gompertzian growth model which has a slower approach to an upper
limit than that of logistic growth. Certain populations of animals and other
organisms have also recently been analyzed with the Gompertz model. This
article addresses the question of how long it takes to reduce the population
from one level to a lower one under a schedule of sudden decrements, each of
which removes a given fraction of the cell mass or population. A deterministic
periodic schedule is first examined and yields exact results for the
eradication or extinction time which is defined as that required to reduce the
number of cells to less than unity. The decrements in cell mass at each hit
could correspond to an approximation to reduction of a tumor by external beam
radiation therapy. The effects of variations in magnitude of successive
decrements, the time interval between them, the initial population size and the
intrinsic growth rate are calculated and results presented graphically.
  With a schedule governed by a Poisson process, the number of organisms or
cells satisfies a stochastic differential equation whose solution sample paths
have downward jumps as random times. The moments of the exit time then satisfy
a system of recurrent differential-difference equations. A simple
transformation results in a simpler system which has been studied both
analytically and numerically in the context of interspike intervals of a model
neuron. Results are presented for the mean eradication time for various
frequencies and magnitudes of hits and for various eventual and initial
population sizes. The standard deviation of the eradication time is also
investigated.

family of high-dimensional statistical models, including sparse Fisher's
discriminant analysis, canonical correlation analysis, and sufficient dimension
reduction. Sparse GEP involves solving a non-convex optimization problem. Most
existing methods and theory in the context of specific statistical models that
are special cases of the sparse GEP require restrictive structural assumptions
on the input matrices. In this paper, we propose a two-stage computational
framework to solve the sparse GEP. At the first stage, we solve a convex
relaxation of the sparse GEP. Taking the solution as an initial value, we then
exploit a nonconvex optimization perspective and propose the truncated Rayleigh
flow method (Rifle) to estimate the leading generalized eigenvector. We show
that Rifle converges linearly to a solution with the optimal statistical rate
of convergence for many statistical models. Theoretically, our method
significantly improves upon the existing literature by eliminating structural
assumptions on the input matrices for both stages. To achieve this, our
analysis involves two key ingredients: (i) a new analysis of the gradient based
method on nonconvex objective functions, and (ii) a fine-grained
characterization of the evolution of sparsity patterns along the solution path.
Thorough numerical studies are provided to validate the theoretical results.

is a scale-free network. The characteristic properties of percolation is that
it exhibits threshold phenomena as we find sudden or abrupt jump in spanning
probability across $p_c$ accompanied by the divergence of some other observable
quantities which is reminiscent of continuous phase transition. Indeed,
percolation is characterized by the critical behavior of percolation strength
$P(p)\sim (p_c-p)^\beta$, mean cluster size $S\sim (p_c-p)^{-\gamma}$ and the
system size $L\sim (p_c-p)^{-\nu}$ which are known as the equivalent
counterpart of the order parameter, susceptibility and correlation length
respectively. Moreover, the cluster size distribution function $n_s(p_c)\sim
s^{-\tau}$ and the mass-length relation $M\sim L^{d_f}$ of the spanning cluster
also provide useful characterization of the percolation process. We obtain an
exact value for $p_c$ and for all the exponents such as $\beta, \nu, \gamma,
\tau$ and $d_f$. We find that, except $p_c$, all the exponents are exactly the
same in both bond and site percolation despite the significant difference in
the definition of cluster and other quantities. Our results suggest that the
percolation on WPSL belongs to a new universality class as its exponents do not
share the same value as for all the existing planar lattices and like other

However, the observable disk averaged polarization should be zero if the clouds
are uniformly distributed and the object is spherically symmetric. Therefore,
in order to explain the observed large polarization of several L-dwarfs,
rotation-induced oblateness or horizontally inhomogeneous cloud distribution in
the atmosphere is invoked. On the other hand, when an extra-solar planet of
Earth-size or larger transits the brown dwarf along the line of sight, the
asymmetry induced during the transit gives rise to a net non-zero, time
dependent polarization. Employing atmospheric models for a range of effective
temperature and surface gravity appropriate for T- and L-dwarfs, I derive the
time dependent polarization profiles of these objects during transit phase and
estimate the peak amplitude of polarization that occurs during the inner
contact points of the transit ingress/egress phase. It is found that peak
polarization in the range of 0.2-1.0 % at I- and J-band may arise of cloudy L
dwarfs occulted by Earth-size or larger exoplanets. Such an amount of

an arbitrary pure qubit. Even so, our scheme saves classical communication by
approximate 1 bit per prepared qubit under equal conditions. When using a
maximally entangled state, the classical communication for our scheme is 2
bits, which agrees with Lo's conjecture on the resource cost. Furthermore Alice
can switch between our RSP scheme and a standard teleportation scheme without
letting Bob know, which makes the quantum channel multipurpose.

  Algorithm Version",,,,,"cs.RO","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Mobile robot navigation in total or partially unknown environments is still
an open problem. The path planning algorithms lack completeness and/or
performance. Thus, there is the need for complete (i.e., the algorithm
determines in finite time either a solution or correctly reports that there is
none) and performance (i.e., with low computational complexity) oriented
algorithms which need to perform efficiently in real scenarios. In this paper
we evaluate the efficiency of two versions of the A star algorithm for mobile
robot navigation inside indoor environments with the help of two software
applications and the Pioneer 2DX robot. We demonstrate that an improved version
of the A star algorithm (we call this the fast A star algorithm) which (a
different version of this algorithm is widely used in video games) can be
successfully used for indoor mobile robot navigation. We evaluated the two
versions of the A star algorithm first, by implementing the algorithms in
source code and by testing them on a simulator and second, by comparing two
operation modes of the fast A star algorithm w.r.t. path planning efficiency
(i.e., completness) and performance (i.e., time need to complete the path
traversing) for indoor navigation with the Pioneer 2DX robot. The results
obtained with the fast A star algorithm are promising and we think that this
results can be further improved by tweaking the algorithm and by using an
advanced sensor fusion approach (i.e., combine the inputs of multiple robot
sensors) for better dealing with partially known environments.

value"" logic proposed by Wang and Fan \cite{WF13} can be viewed as a disguised
normal modal logic by treating the negation of the Kv operator as a special
diamond. Under this perspective, it turns out that the original first-order
Kripke semantics can be greatly simplified by introducing a ternary relation
$R_i^c$ in standard Kripke models, which associates one world with two
$i$-accessible worlds that do not agree on the value of constant $c$. Under
intuitive constraints, the modal logic based on such Kripke models is exactly
the one studied by Wang and Fan (2013,2014}. Moreover, there is a very natural
binary generalization of the ""knowing value"" diamond, which, surprisingly, does
not increase the expressive power of the logic. The resulting logic with the
binary diamond has a transparent normal modal system, which sharpens our
understanding of the ""knowing value"" logic and simplifies some previously hard
problems.

the effect of the only drug (Riluzole) approved for treating Amyotrophic
Lateral Sclerosis (ALS). Our proposed method of model-based ran- dom forests
detects similarities in the treatment effect among patients and on this basis
computes personalised models for new patients. The entire procedure focuses on
a base model, which usually contains the treatment indicator as a single
covariate and takes the survival time or a health or treatment success
measurement as primary outcome. This base model is used both to grow the
model-based trees within the forest, in which the patient characteristics that
interact with the treatment are split variables, and to com- pute the
personalised models, in which the similarity measurements enter as weights. We
applied the personalised models using data from several clinical trials for ALS
from the PRO-ACT database. Our results indicate that some ALS patients benefit
more from the drug Riluzole than others. Our method allows shifting from
stratified medicine to person- alised medicine and can also be used in
assessing the treatment effect for other diseases studied in a clinical trial.

social relationships between user equipments (UEs) and their physical proximity
to optimize the network throughput. We formulate the problem as a matching game
between UEs and their serving nodes (SNs). In our proposed game, the serving
node can be a small cell base station (SCBS) or an important node with
device-to-device capabilities. In this game, the SCBSs and UEs maximize their
respective utility functions capturing both the spatial and social structures
of the network. We show that the proposed game belongs to the class of matching
games with externalities. Subsequently, we propose a distributed algorithm

precoder comprises an inner linear precoder which utilizes only the second
order statistics of the channel state information (CSI) and outer THPs which
use the instantaneous overall CSI of the cascade of the actual channel and the
inner precoder. The user terminals are divided into groups, where for each
group a THP successively mitigates the intra-group interference, whereas the
inter-group interference is canceled by the inner linear precoder. Our
simulation results show that the bit error rate (BER) of the proposed H-L-THP
precoder is close to that of the conventional THP precoder, and is
substantially lower than the BER of the commonly used regularized zero-forcing
(RZF) precoder. Moreover, we derive exact expressions for the computational
complexity of the proposed H-L-THP precoder in terms of the required numbers of
floating-point operations. These results reveal that the proposed H-L-THP
precoder has a much lower computational complexity than the conventional THP

implementations.

approximation (D$\Gamma$A), to study several spectral and thermodynamic
properties of the unfrustrated Hubbard model in two and three dimensions.
Specifically, we focus first on the low-energy regime by computing the
electronic scattering rate and the quasiparticle mass renormalization for
decreasing temperatures at a fixed interaction strength. This way, we obtain a
precise characterization of the several steps, through which the Fermi-liquid
physics is progressively destroyed by nonlocal correlations. Our study is then
extended to a broader energy range, by analyzing the temperature behavior of
the kinetic and potential energy, as well as of the corresponding energy
distribution functions. Our findings allow us to identify a smooth, but
definite evolution of the nature of nonlocal correlations by increasing
interaction: They either increase or decrease the kinetic energy w.r.t. DMFT
depending on the interaction strength being weak or strong, respectively. This
reflects the corresponding evolution of the ground state from a nesting-driven
(Slater) to a superexchange-driven (Heisenberg) antiferromagnet (AF), whose
fingerprints are, thus, recognizable in the spatial correlations of the
paramagnetic phase. Finally, a critical analysis of our numerical results of
the potential energy at the largest interaction allows us to identify possible
procedures to improve the ladder-based algorithms adopted in the dynamical
vertex approximation.

paper we study the fluctuations of the concentration of a reactive species
involved in a cyclic network that is in a non-equilibrium steady state
perturbed by a noisy force, taking into account both the breaking of detailed

oscillating scalar pulse. We argue that such backgrounds are the counterpart of
quantum revivals in the dual field theory. We perform a qualitative comparison
with the quench dynamics of the massive Schwinger model, which has been
recently analyzed using tensor network techniques. Agreement is found provided
the width of the oscillating scalar pulse is inversely linked to the energy
density communicated by the quench. We propose this to be a general feature of
holographic quenches.

  Equation","38 pages, 28 figures",,,,"nlin.PS","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We study grain boundaries between striped phases in the prototypical
Swift-Hohenberg equation. We propose an analytical and numerical far-field-core
decomposition that allows us to study existence and bifurcations of grain
boundaries analytically and numerically using continuation techniques. This
decomposition overcomes problems with computing grain boundaries in a large
doubly periodic box with phase conditions. Using the spatially conserved
quantities of the time-independent Swift-Hohenberg equation, we show that
symmetric grain boundaries must select the marginally zig-zag stable stripes.
We find that as the angle between the stripes is decreased, the symmetric grain
boundary undergoes a parity-breaking pitchfork bifurcation where dislocations
at the grain boundary split into disclination pairs. A plethora of asymmetric
grain boundaries (with different angles of the far-field stripes either side of
the boundary) is found and investigated. The energy of the grain boundaries is
then mapped out. We find that when the angle between the stripes is greater
than a critical angle, the symmetric grain boundary is energetically preferred
while when the angle is less than the critical angle, the grain boundaries
where stripes on one side are parallel to the interface are energetically
preferred. Finally, we propose a classification of grain boundaries that allows
us to predict various non-standard asymmetric grain boundaries.

environments may not reach separations small enough to allow significant GW
emission, but rather stall on (sub)pc-scale orbits. This ""last-parsec problem""
can be eased by the appearance of a third massive black hole (MBH) -- the
""intruder"" -- whose action can force, under certain conditions, the inner MBHB
on a very eccentric orbit, hence allowing intense GW emission eventually
leading to coalescence. A detailed assessment of the process, ultimately driven
by the induced Kozai-Lidov oscillations of the MBHB orbit, requires a general
relativistic treatment and the inclusion of external factors, such as the
Newtonian precession of the intruder orbit in the galactic potential and its
hardening by scattering off background stars. In order to tackle this problem,
we developed a three-body Post-Newtonian (PN) code framed in a realistic

dissipative terms such as 2.5PN effects, orbital hardening of the outer binary,

derive the dynamical mass M_dyn of nearby galaxies. Both components become too
faint to be used as a tracer in observations of high-redshift galaxies. In
those cases, the 158 $\mu$m line of atomic carbon [CII] may be the only way to
derive M_dyn. As the distribution and kinematics of the ISM tracer affects the
determination of M_dyn, it is important to quantify the relative distributions
of HI, CO and [CII]. HI and CO are well-characterised observationally, however,
for [CII] only very few measurements exist. Here we compare observations of CO,
HI, and [CII] emission of a sample of nearby galaxies, drawn from the HERACLES,
THINGS and KINGFISH surveys. We find that within R_25, the average [CII]
exponential radial profile is slightly shallower than that of the CO, but much
steeper than the HI distribution. This is also reflected in the integrated
spectrum (""global profile""), where the [CII] spectrum looks more like that of
the CO than that of the HI. For one galaxy, a spectrally resolved comparison of
integrated spectra was possible; other comparisons were limited by the
intrinsic line-widths of the galaxies and the coarse velocity resolution of the
[CII] data. Using high-spectral-resolution SOFIA [CII] data of a number of star
forming regions in two nearby galaxies, we find that their [CII] linewidths
agree better with those of the CO than the HI. As the radial extent of a given
ISM tracer is a key input in deriving M_dyn from spatially unresolved data, we
conclude that the relevant length-scale to use in determining M_dyn based on
[CII] data, is that of the well-characterised CO distribution. This length
scale is similar to that of the optical disk.

control loop on the high-contrast imaging instrument SCExAO (Subaru
Coronagraphic Extreme Adaptive Optics). The sensor relies on the Fourier
analysis of conventional focal-plane images acquired after an asymmetric mask
is introduced in the pupil of the instrument. This absolute sensor is used here
in a closed-loop to compensate the non-common path errors that normally affects
any imaging system relying on an upstream adaptive optics system.This specific
implementation was used to control low order modes corresponding to eight
zernike modes (from focus to spherical). This loop was successfully run on-sky
at the Subaru Telescope and is used to offset the SCExAO deformable mirror
shape used as a zero-point by the high-order wavefront sensor. The paper
precises the range of errors this wavefront sensing approach can operate within
and explores the impact of saturation of the data and how it can be bypassed,
at a cost in performance. Beyond this application, because of its low hardware
impact, APF-WFS can easily be ported in a wide variety of wavefront sensing
contexts, for ground- as well space-borne telescopes, and for telescope pupils
that can be continuous, segmented or even sparse. The technique is powerful
because it measures the wavefront where it really matters, at the level of the
science detector.

formation model can be effectively optimized for the scene normals. However, in
murky water this is a very challenging problem. The light from artificial
sources is not only reflected by the scene but it is also scattered by the
medium particles, yielding the backscatter component. Backscatter corresponds
to a complex term with several unknown variables, and makes the problem of
normal estimation hard. In this work, we show that instead of trying to
optimize the complex backscatter model or use previous unrealistic
simplifications, we can approximate the per-pixel backscatter signal directly
from the captured images. Our method is based on the observation that
backscatter is saturated beyond a certain distance, i.e. it becomes scene-depth
independent, and finally corresponds to a smoothly varying signal which depends
strongly on the light position with respect to each pixel. Our backscatter
approximation method facilitates imaging and scene reconstruction in murky
water when the illumination is artificial as in Photometric Stereo.
Specifically, we show that it allows accurate scene normal estimation and
offers potentials like single image restoration. We evaluate our approach using
numerical simulations and real experiments within both the controlled
environment of a big water-tank and real murky port-waters.

No air is detected, within the limits of measurement uncertainties, for
separation distances smaller than 5 mm. For larger distances, the effect of
ambient air can no longer be neglected, and radial gradients in the

$G$ (OPVR of $G$) is an embedding-preserving drawing of $G$ that maps every

of crossings per edge and to its connectivity. More precisely, we prove that if
$G$ has at most one crossing per edge (i.e., $G$ is a 1-plane graph), an OPVR
of $G$ always exists while this may not be the case if two crossings per edge
are allowed. Also, if $G$ is a 3-connected 1-plane graph, we can compute an
OPVR of $G$ whose vertex complexity is bounded by a constant in $O(n)$ time.
However, if $G$ is a 2-connected 1-plane graph, the vertex complexity of any
OPVR of $G$ may be $\Omega(n)$. In contrast, we describe a family of
2-connected 1-plane graphs for which an embedding that guarantees constant
vertex complexity can be computed in $O(n)$ time. Finally, we present the
results of an experimental study on the vertex complexity of ortho-polygon

more than 100,000 stars. Deriving chemical abundances patterns of these stars
is paramount to piecing together the structure of the Milky Way. While the
derived chemical abundances have been shown to be precise for most stars, some
calibration problems have been reported, in particular for more metal- poor
stars. Aims. In this paper, we aim to (1) re-determine the chemical abundances
of the APOGEE+Kepler stellar sample (APOKASC) with an independent procedure,
line list and line selection, and high quality surface gravity information from
astroseismology, and (2) extend the abundance catalogue by including abundances
that are not currently reported in the most recent APOGEE release (DR12).
Methods. We fixed the Teff and log g to those determined using
spectrophotometric and asteroseismic techniques, respectively. We made use of
the Brussels Automatic Stellar Parameter (BACCHUS) code to derive the
metallicity and broadening parameters for the APOKASC sample. In addition, we
derived differential abundances with respect to Arcturus. Results. We have
validated the BACCHUS code on APOGEE data using several well-known stars, and
stars from open and globular clusters. We also provide the abundances of C, N,
O, Mg, Ca, Si, Ti, S, Al, Na, Ni, Mn, Fe, K, P, Cr, Co, Cu, Rb, Yb and V for
every star, line, and show the impact of line selection on the final
abundances. These include abundances of five new elements and improved
abundances for Si, Ti, S, and V. Conclusions. In this paper, we present an
independent analysis of the APOKASC sample and provide abundances of up to 21
elements. This catalogue can be used not only to study chemical abundance
patterns of the Galaxy but also to train data driven spectral approaches which
can improve the abundance precision in a restricted dataset, but also full

For example, in a multi robot system the agents need the ability to effectively
detect and tolerate internal failures in order to continue performing their
tasks without the need for immediate human intervention. The system must react
to unplanned events in order to optimize the task allocation between the
robots. In a broad sense, the resilience of a system can be defined as the
ability to maintain or recover a stable state when subject to disturbance and
it is related to the concept of robustness in industrial systems. In this
paper, we study the resilience in a synchronized multi-robot system stated as
follows:Consider a team of $n$ (ground or aerial) robots each moving along
predetermined periodic closed trajectories. Each of the agents needs to
communicate informationabout its operation to other agents, but the
communication links have a limited range. Hence, when two agents are within
communication range, a communication link is established, and information is
exchanged. Thus, two neighbors are synchronized if they visit the communication
link at the same time and a multi-robot system is called synchronized if each
pair of neighbors is synchronized. If a set of robots left the system, then
some trajectories has no robots. In these cases, when an alive robot detects no
neighboring robot then it pass to this neighboring trajectory to assume the
unattended task. In this framework, a fault-tolerance measure is introduced:
the resilience of the system is the largest number of robots that can fail
while executing the global task. Interesting combinatorial properties of the
resilience are showed that allow to know its value for some usual scenarios.

interest point response function using two intuitive and effective geometric
properties of the local surface on a 3D mesh model, namely Euclidean distances
between the neighborhood vertices to the tangent plane of a vertex and the
angles of normal vectors of them. The response function is defined in
multi-scale space and can be utilized to effectively distinguish 3D interest
points from edges and flat areas. Those points with local maximal 3D interest
point response value are selected as the candidates of 3D interest points.
Finally, we utilize an $\ell_0$ norm based optimization method to refine the
candidates of 3D interest points by constraining its quality and quantity.
Numerical experiments demonstrate that our proposed GMSR based 3D interest

interparticle interactions. The wavefunction is expanded in a variationally
optimized time-dependent many-body basis generated by a set of effective
creation operators that are related to the original particle creation operators
by a time-dependent unitary transform. We use the time-dependent variational
principle for the coefficients of this transform as well as the expansion
coefficients of the wavefunction in the time-dependent many-body basis as
variational parameters to derive equations of motion. The convergence of
MCTDH-X is shown by comparing its results to the exact diagonalization of one-,
two-, and three-dimensional lattices filled with bosons with contact
interactions. We use MCTDH-X to study the buildup of correlations in the
long-time splitting dynamics of a Bose-Einstein condensate loaded into a large
two-dimensional lattice subject to a barrier that is ramped up in the center.
We find that the system is split into two parts with emergent time-dependent
correlations that depend on the ramping time -- for most barrier-raising-times
the system becomes two-fold fragmented, but for some of the very fast ramps,
the system shows revivals of coherence.

that are now commonly used in the scientific community: data mining and complex
network theory. Not only do complex network analysis and data mining share the
same general goal, that of extracting information from complex systems to
ultimately create a new compact quantifiable representation, but they also
often address similar problems too. In the face of that, a surprisingly low
number of researchers turn out to resort to both methodologies. One may then be
tempted to conclude that these two fields are either largely redundant or
totally antithetic. The starting point of this review is that this state of

and that these two fields can in fact advantageously be used in a synergistic
manner. An overview of both fields is first provided, some fundamental concepts
of which are illustrated. A variety of contexts in which complex network theory
and data mining have been used in a synergistic manner are then presented.
Contexts in which the appropriate integration of complex network metrics can
lead to improved classification rates with respect to classical data mining
algorithms and, conversely, contexts in which data mining can be used to tackle
important issues in complex network theory applications are illustrated.
Finally, ways to achieve a tighter integration between complex networks and

$g$-factors, i.e. the magnetic moment in units of the nuclear magneton, are
determined by measuring the respective ratio of the spin-precession frequency
to the cyclotron frequency. The spin precession frequency is measured by
non-destructive detection of spin quantum transitions using the continuous
Stern-Gerlach effect, and the cyclotron frequency is determined from the
particle's motional eigenfrequencies in the Penning trap using the invariance
theorem. By application of the double Penning-trap method we expect that in our
measurements a fractional precision of $\delta g/g$ 10$^{-9}$ can be achieved.

theory (RMT: Fiske 1991, 1992) and a social and political one, cultural or
plural rationality theory (PRT: Douglas, 1982, Thompson et al., 1990). Drawing
examples from the literature of both theories, we argue that each relational
model of RMT may be implemented in ways compatible with each cultural bias of
PRT. A cultural bias restrains the range of congruent implementations of
relational models, but does not preclude any relational model altogether. This
stands in contrast to earlier reconciliation attempts between PRT and RMT.
Based on hypothetical one-to-one mappings, these attempts expect each cultural
setting to be significantly associated with some, but not all, relational
models. The framework we develop helps explain the findings of these previous
attempts and provides insights into empirical research by clarifying which
associations to expect between relationships and cultural contexts. We discuss
the theoretical basis of our framework, including the idea that RMT and PRT
apply to different levels of analysis: RMT's relational models are tied to
relationships between two actors and PRT's cultural biases to structures of
social networks.

the outer regions of the protosolar nebula is a major open question in
planetary science. Some scenarios of comet formation predict that these bodies
agglomerated from crystalline ices condensed in the protosolar nebula.
Concurrently, alternative scenarios suggest that comets accreted amorphous ice
originating from the interstellar cloud or from the very distant regions of the
protosolar nebula. On the basis of existing laboratory and modeling data, we
find that the N$_2$/CO and Ar/CO ratios measured in the coma of the Jupiter
family comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko by the ROSINA instrument aboard the
European Space Agency's Rosetta spacecraft match those predicted for gases
trapped in clathrates. If these measurements are representative of the bulk
N$_2$/CO and Ar/CO ratios in 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko, it implies that the
ices accreted by the comet formed in the nebula and do not originate from the
interstellar medium, supporting the idea that the building blocks of outer
solar system bodies have been formed from clathrates and possibly from pure
crystalline ices. Moreover, because 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko is impoverished

the framework of two extreme scenarios: (1) agglomeration from pristine
amorphous icy grains/particles formed in ISM and (2) agglomeration from
clathrates that formed during the disk's cooling. The former scenario is found
consistent with the strong correlation between O2 and H2O observed in 67P/C-G's

states we are able to solve the main issues of any quantum metrological
problem: the best achievable precision determined by the quantum Fisher
information, the best initial state and the best measurement. Studying the
short time behavior and comparing to regular Markovian dynamics we observe an
increase of quantum Fisher information. We emphasize that this phenomenon is
due to the ability to perform measurements below the correlation time of the
bath, activating non-Markovian effects. This brings huge consequences for the
sequential preparation-and- measurement scenario as the quantum Fisher
information becomes unbounded when the initial probe mean energy goes to

different environments can provide important information about the effects of
the environment and the physical mechanisms responsible for the morphological
transformations. As part of a complete analysis of the young cluster
RXJ1257+4738 at z$\sim$0.9, we studied in this work the morphological
properties of its galaxies. We used non-parametric methods of morphological
classification, as implemented in the galSVM code. The classification with the
applied method was possible even using ground-based observations: r'-band
imaging from OSIRIS/GTC. We defined very conservative probability limits,
taking into account the probability errors, in order to obtain a trustworthy
classification. In this way we were able to classify about the 30% of all
cluster members, and to separate between LT and ET galaxies. Additionally, when
analysing the colour-magnitude diagram, we observed a significant population of
blue ET galaxies between the classified ones. We discussed possible
explanations for the finding of this population. Moreover, we studied different
physical properties of LT, ET, and blue ET galaxies. They turn out to be
comparable, with the exception of the stellar mass that shows that the red ET
population is more massive. We also analysed the morphology-density and
morphology-radius relations, observing that, only when considering the
morphological separation between ET and LT galaxies, a mild classical behaviour
is obtained. RXJ1257+4738 is a young galaxy cluster, showing a clumpy structure
and being still in the process of formation, which could explain the lack of
some of the standard morphological relations. This makes this cluster a very
attractive case for obtaining the higher resolution data and for studying in
more details the morphological properties of the entire cluster and relation
with the environment.

account the dependence between the two responses in a real HIV/AIDS dataset

linear mixed effects dispersion model to adjust the CD4 longitudinal biomarker
data with a between-individual heterogeneity in the mean and variance. In doing
so we are relaxing the usual assumption of a common variance for the
longitudinal residuals. A hazard regression model is considered in addition to
model the time since HIV/AIDS diagnostic until failure, being the coefficients,
accounting for the linking between the longitudinal and survival processes,
time-varying. This flexibility is specified using Penalized Splines and allows
the relationship to vary in time. Because heteroscedasticity may be related
with the survival, the standard deviation is considered as a covariate in the
hazard model, thus enabling to study the effect of the CD4 counts' stability on
the survival. The proposed framework outperforms the most used joint models,
highlighting the importance in correctly taking account the individual
heterogeneity for the measurement errors variance and the evolution of the
disease over time in bringing new insights to better understand this

based on a combination of disordered local moments picture and ab initio

the efficiency of the simulations of elastic properties using recently
introduced method: symmetry imposed force constant temperature dependent
effective potential (SIFC-TDEP). We have chosen cubic paramagnetic CrN as a
model system. This is done due to its technological importance and its
demonstrated strong coupling between magnetic and lattice degrees of freedom.
We have studied the temperature dependent single-crystal and polycrystalline
elastic constants of paramagentic CrN up to 1200 K. The obtained results at T=
300 K agree well with the experimental values of polycrystalline elastic
constants as well as Poisson ratio at room temperature. We observe that the
Young's modulus is strongly dependent on temperature, decreasing by ~14% from
T=300 K to 1200 K. In addition we have studied the elastic anisotropy of CrN as
a function of temperature and we observe that CrN becomes substantially more
isotropic as the temperature increases. We demonstrate that the use of Birch
law may lead to substantial errors for calculations of temperature induced
changes of elastic moduli. The proposed methodology can be used for accurate
predictions of mechanical properties of magnetic materials at temperatures
above their magnetic order-disorder phase transition.

networks, the log-softmax has two potential limitations. First, it involves
computations that scale linearly with the number of output classes, which can
restrict the size of problems we are able to tackle with current hardware.
Second, it remains unclear how close it matches the task loss such as the top-k
error rate or other non-differentiable evaluation metrics which we aim to
optimize ultimately. In this paper, we introduce an alternative classification
loss function, the Z-loss, which is designed to address these two issues.
Unlike the log-softmax, it has the desirable property of belonging to the
spherical loss family (Vincent et al., 2015), a class of loss functions for
which training can be performed very efficiently with a complexity independent
of the number of output classes. We show experimentally that it significantly
outperforms the other spherical loss functions previously investigated.
Furthermore, we show on a word language modeling task that it also outperforms
the log-softmax with respect to certain ranking scores, such as top-k scores,
suggesting that the Z-loss has the flexibility to better match the task loss.
These qualities thus makes the Z-loss an appealing candidate to train very
efficiently large output networks such as word-language models or other extreme
classification problems. On the One Billion Word (Chelba et al., 2014) dataset,
we are able to train a model with the Z-loss 40 times faster than the
log-softmax and more than 4 times faster than the hierarchical softmax.

M/M_sun<15.0, for a total of 1986 late-type galaxies. We find that late-type
galaxies in the centers of groups lack HI at fixed stellar mass relative to the
regions surrounding them. Larger groups show evidence of a stronger dependence
of HI properties on environment, despite a similar dependence of color on
environment at fixed stellar mass. We compare several environment variables to
determine which is the best predictor of galaxy properties; group-centric
distance r and r/R_200 are similarly effective predictors, while local density
is slightly more effective and group size and halo mass are slightly less
effective. While both central and satellite galaxies in the blue cloud exhibit
a significant dependence of HI content on local density, only centrals show a
strong dependence on stellar mass, and only satellites show a strong dependence
on halo mass. Finally, we see evidence that HI is deficient for blue cloud
galaxies in denser environments even when both stellar mass and color are
fixed. This is consistent with a picture where HI is removed or destroyed,
followed by reddening within the blue cloud. Our results support the existence
of pre-processing in isolated groups, along with an additional rapid mechanism
for gas removal within larger groups and clusters, perhaps ram-pressure

life on earth. The thermal limits for their active metabolism and reproduction
are bracketed by the temperature interval 0C<T<50C. The same interval applies
to the photosynthetic production of oxygen, an essential ingredient of complex
life, and for the generation of atmospheric biosignatures. Analysis of the main
mechanisms responsible for the thermal thresholds of terrestrial life suggests
that the same mechanisms would apply to other forms of chemical life. We
propose a habitability index for complex life, h050, representing the mean
orbital fraction of planetary surface that satisfies the temperature limits
0C<T<50C. With the aid of a climate model tailored for the calculation of the
surface temperature of Earth-like planets, we calculated h050 as a function of
planet insolation S, and atmospheric columnar mass Natm, for a few earth-like
atmospheric compositions. By displaying h050 as a function of S and Natm, we
built up an atmospheric mass habitable zone (AMHZ) for complex life. At
variance with the classic habitable zone, the inner edge of the complex life HZ
is not affected by the uncertainties inherent to the calculation of the runaway
greenhouse limit. The complex life HZ is significantly narrower than the HZ of
dry planets. Our calculations illustrate how changes in ambient conditions
dependent on S and Natm, such as temperature excursions and surface dose of
secondary particles of cosmic rays, may influence the type of life potentially

intuitively meaningful notion of computation shared by all mathematicians.
Martin-L\""of's meaning explanations for constructive type theory define the
concept of a type in terms of computation. Briefly, a type is a complete
(closed) program that evaluates to a canonical type whose members are complete
programs that evaluate to canonical elements of that type. The explanation is
extended to incomplete (open) programs by functionality: types and elements
must respect equality in their free variables. Equality is evidence-free---two
types or elements are at most equal---and equal things are implicitly
interchangeable in all contexts.
  Higher-dimensional type theory extends type theory to account for
identifications of types and elements. An identification witnesses that two
types or elements are explicitly interchangeable in all contexts by an explicit
transport, or coercion, operation. There must be sufficiently many
identifications, which is ensured by imposing a generalized form of the Kan
condition from homotopy theory. Here we provide a Martin-L\""of-style meaning
explanation of simple higher-dimensional type theory based on a programming
language that includes Kan-like constructs witnessing the computational meaning
of the higher structure of types. The treatment includes an example of a higher
inductive type (namely, the 1-dimensional sphere) and an example of Voevodsky's
univalence principle, which identifies equivalent types.
  The main result is a computational canonicity theorem that validates the
computational interpretation: a closed boolean expression must always evaluate
to a boolean value, even in the presence of higher-dimensional structure. This

presence of ""preformed"" Cooper pairs well above the superconducting critical
temperature. In this regime, the electrons are paired, but they lack the phase
coherence necessary for superconductivity. The existence of preformed pairs
implies the existence of a characteristic energy scale associated to a
pseudogap. Preformed pairs are often invoked to interpret systems where some
signatures of pairing are present without actual superconductivity, but an
unambiguous theoretical characterization of a preformed-pair system is still
lacking. To fill this gap, we consider the response to an external pairing
field of an attractive Hubbard model, which hosts one of the cleanest
realizations of a preformed pair phase, and a repulsive model where s-wave
superconductivity can not be realized. Using dynamical mean-field theory to
study this response, we identify the characteristic features which distinguish
the reaction of a preformed pair state from a normal metal without any
precursor of pairing. The theoretical detection of preformed pairs is
associated with the behavior of the second derivative of the order parameter
with respect to the external field, as confirmed by analytic calculations in
limiting cases. Our findings provide a solid testbed for the interpretation of
state-of-the-art calculations for the normal state of the doped Hubbard model
in terms of d-wave preformed pairs and, in perspective, of non-equilibrium
experiments in high-temperature superconductors.

which increases with increasing the magnetic field strength, and the
$\pi^{\pm}$ mass ascends suddenly at almost the same critical temperature.
While the $\rho$ mesons' masses decrease with the temperature but increase with
the magnetic field strength. We also check the Gell-Mann-Oakes-Renner relation
and find that the relation can be violated obviously with increasing the
temperature, and the effect of the magnetic field becomes pronounced around the
critical temperature. With different criteria, we analyze the effect of the
magnetic field on the chiral phase transition and find that the pseudo-critical
temperature of the chiral phase cross, $T_{c}^{\chi}$, is always enhanced by
the magnetic field. Moreover our calculations indicate that the $\rho$ mesons

correct Lagrangian of dilaton gravity, one should check at least two
requirements: compatibility with Brans-Dicke theory and appropriate special
situations. Finally, we apply the mentioned method to obtain analytical
solutions of dilaton-Born-Infeld and Brans-Dicke-Born-Infeld theories with
energy dependent spacetime.

widely used for modelling and analysing biological systems. PBNs are suited for
modelling large biological systems, which more and more often arise in systems
biology. However, the large system size poses a~significant challenge to the
analysis of PBNs, in particular, to the crucial analysis of their steady-state
behaviour. Numerical methods for performing steady-state analyses suffer from
the state-space explosion problem, which makes the utilisation of statistical
methods the only viable approach. However, such methods require long
simulations of PBNs, rendering the simulation speed a crucial efficiency
factor. For large PBNs and high estimation precision requirements, a slow
simulation speed becomes an obstacle. In this paper, we propose a
structure-based method for fast simulation of PBNs. This method first performs
a network reduction operation and then divides nodes into groups for parallel
simulation. Experimental results show that our method can lead to an
approximately 10 times speedup for computing steady-state probabilities of a
real-life biological network.

  authors, available on arXiv:1708.00920",,,,"physics.bio-ph physics.chem-ph quant-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  To explain experimentally observed oscillatory dynamics of highly efficient
process of excitation energy transfer (EET) in Fenna-Matthews-Olson (FMO)
complex, most theoretical models assume the same local protein environment
around all the bacteriochlorophyll-a (BChla) sites, contradictory to the
structural analysis of FMO complex. Using different values of pigment-protein
couplings for different BChla sites, measured in the adiabatic limit of
electron transfer, we theoretically investigate the effect of inhomogeneous
local protein environment on excitation energy transfer. By employing
non-Markovian master equation we demonstrate that the asymmetric system-bath
coupling leads to the results consistent with the experimental observations.
Quantum dynamical simulation suggests that the correlated fuctuations preserve
the oscillation of excitation for long time-scales. Further different BChla
sites have asymmetric time-scales of oscillations of excitation due to
in-homogeneous pigment-protein couplings also.

approximated by the Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) functions, each layer of of

DCTNet to spectral feature representation methods, such as the the short time

DCTNet improves classification rate, demonstrating DCTNet's applicability to

integer variables in the second-stage are generally difficult to solve. This
paper develops the theory of integer set reduction for characterizing the
subset of the convex hull of feasible integer points of the second-stage
subproblem which can be used for solving the SMIP. The basic idea is to
consider a small enough subset of feasible integer points that is necessary for
generating a valid inequality for the integer subproblem. An algorithm for
obtaining such a subset based on the solution of the subproblem LP-relaxation
is then devised and incorporated into the Fenchel decomposition method for
SMIP. To demonstrate the performance of the new integer set reduction
methodology, a computational study based on randomly generated test instances
was performed. The results of the study show that integer set reduction
provides significant gains in terms of generating cuts faster leading to better
bounds in solving SMIPs than using a direct solver.

$x\in\mathbb{R}^2$, $y\in\mathbb{R}$, where $f(x)$ is the distribution function
of the shape elongation and spin vector obliquity, and $C(y)$ is the cumulative
distribution function of an observable $y$ describing the variation of the
observed projection areas of one member, and show that the mapping is
invertible. Using the projected area of an ellipsoid as our model, we obtain
analytical basis functions for a function series of $C(y)$ and prove uniqueness
and stability properties of the inverse problem. Even though the model error is
considerably larger than the measurement noise for realistic cases of arbitrary
