  User-Independent Constraints",,,,,"cs.AI cs.CC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The fixed parameter tractable (FPT) approach is a powerful tool in tackling
computationally hard problems. In this paper, we link FPT results to classic
artificial intelligence (AI) techniques to show how they complement each other.
Specifically, we consider the workflow satisfiability problem (WSP) which asks
whether there exists an assignment of authorised users to the steps in a
workflow specification, subject to certain constraints on the assignment. It
was shown by Cohen et al. (JAIR 2014) that WSP restricted to the class of
user-independent constraints (UI), covering many practical cases, admits FPT
algorithms, i.e. can be solved in time exponential only in the number of steps
$k$ and polynomial in the number of users $n$. Since usually $k << n$ in WSP,
such FPT algorithms are of great practical interest. We present a new
interpretation of the FPT nature of the WSP with UI constraints giving a
decomposition of the problem into two levels. Exploiting this two-level split,
we develop a new FPT algorithm that is by many orders of magnitude faster than
the previous state-of-the-art WSP algorithm and also has only polynomial-space
complexity. We also introduce new pseudo-Boolean (PB) and Constraint
Satisfaction (CSP) formulations of the WSP with UI constraints which
efficiently exploit this new decomposition of the problem and raise the novel
issue of how to use general-purpose solvers to tackle FPT problems in a fashion
that meets FPT efficiency expectations. In our computational study, we
investigate, for the first time, the phase transition (PT) properties of the
WSP, under a model for generation of random instances. We show how PT studies
can be extended, in a novel fashion, to support empirical evaluation of scaling
of FPT algorithms.

obtained. In the spatially extended system in the thermodynamic limit there
exists a mean-field ground state degeneracy between a family of nematic states
for appropriate interaction parameters. It has been established that quantum
fluctuations lift this degeneracy through the mechanism of order-by-disorder
and select either a uniaxial or square-biaxial ground state. On the other hand,
in the full quantum treatment of the analogous single-spatial mode problem with
finite particle number it is known that, due to symmetry restoring
fluctuations, there is a unique ground state across the entire nematic region
of the phase diagram. Within the established rotor framework we investigate the
possible quantum phases under the presence of a quadratic Zeeman field, a
problem which has previously received little attention. By investigating wave
function overlaps we do not find any signatures of the order-by-disorder
phenomenon which is present in the continuum case. Motivated by this we
consider an alternative external potential which breaks less symmetry than the

order-by-disorder in the fully quantum system. This is established within the

condensation of inorganic dust is poorly understood. Aims: Identify and
characterize aluminum bearing species in the circumstellar gas of Mira ($o$
Ceti) in order to elucidate their role in the production of Al$_2$O$_3$ dust.
Methods: Multiepoch spectral line observations at (sub-)millimeter,
far-infrared, and optical wavelengths including: maps with ALMA which probe the
gas distribution in the immediate vicinity of the star at ~30 mas; observations
with ALMA, APEX, and Herschel in 2013-2015 for studying cycle and inter-cycle
variability of the rotational lines of Al bearing molecules; optical records as
far back as 1965 to examine variations in electronic transitions over time
spans of days to decades; and velocity measurements and excitation analysis of
the spectral features which constrain the physical parameters of the gas.
Results: Three diatomic molecules AlO, AlOH, and AlH, and atomic Al I are the
main observable aluminum species in Mira, although a significant fraction of
aluminum might reside in other species that have not yet been identified.
Strong irregular variability in the (sub-)millimeter and optical features of
AlO (possibly the direct precursor of Al$_2$O$_3$) indicates substantial
changes in the excitation conditions, or varying abundance that is likely
related to shocks in the star. The inhomogeneous distribution of AlO might
influence the spatial and temporal characteristics of dust production.
Conclusions: We are unable to quantitatively trace aluminum depletion from the
gas, but the rich observational material constrains time dependent chemical
networks. Future improvements should include spectroscopic characterization of
higher aluminum oxides, coordinated observations of dust and gas species at
different variability phases, and tools to derive abundances in shock excited
gas.

is interested in identifying parameters which will lead to a particular
pattern. To attempt to answer this, we compute eigenpairs of the Laplacian on a
variety of domains and use linear stability analysis to determine parameter
values for the system that will lead to spatially inhomogeneous steady states
whose patterns correspond to particular eigenfunctions. This method has
previously been used on domains and surfaces where the eigenvalues and
eigenfunctions are found analytically in closed form. Our contribution to this
methodology is that we numerically compute eigenpairs on arbitrary domains and

is straightforward especially for low eigenvalues. Additionally we see that if
two or more eigenvalues are in a permissible range then the inhomogeneous

to create quantum computers gets smaller, driven by the promise of
fundamentally faster algorithms and quantum simulations. This occurs by the
combination of experimental ingenuity and ever simpler theoretical schemes.
This thesis comes from the latter perspective, aiming to find new, simpler ways
in which components of a quantum computer could be built. We first search for
ways to create quantum gates, the primitive building blocks of a quantum
computer. We find a novel, low-control way of performing a two-qubit gate on
qubits encoded in a decoherence-free subspace, making use of many-body
interactions that may already be present. This includes an analysis of the
effect of control errors and magnetic field fluctuations on the gate. We then
present novel ways to create three-qubit Toffoli and Fredkin gates in a single
step using linear arrays of qubits, including an assessment of how well these
gates could perform, for quantum or classical computation, using
state-of-the-art ion trap and silicon donor technology. We then focus on a very
different model from the normal circuit model, combining ideas from
measurement-based quantum computation (MBQC) and holonomic quantum computation,
showing that all MBQC patterns with a property called \emph{gflow} can be
converted into a holonomic computation. The manifestation of the properties of
MBQC in this adiabatically driven model is then explored. Finally, we
investigate ways in which quantum information can be communicated between
distant parties, using minimally engineered spin chains. The viability of using
1D Wigner crystals as a quantum channel is analysed, as well as schemes using
ideal uniform spin chains with next-neighbour interactions, and edge-locking
effects.

tight-binding model, which allows us to attribute this phenomenon to an
enhancement of the effective electron-phonon coupling constant. This work

environment with moving obstacles is a challenging research question and
attracts more and more attentions recently. Most existing methods either
restrict to static environments or lack performance guarantees. This motivates
us to investigate the ITMP problem using formal methods and propose a bottom-up
compositional design approach called CoSMoP (Composition of Safe Motion
Primitives). Our basic idea is to synthesize a global motion plan through
composing simple local moves and actions, and to achieve its performance
guarantee through modular and incremental verifications. The design consists of
two steps. First, basic motion primitives are designed and verified locally.
Then, a global motion path is built upon these certified motion primitives by
concatenating them together. In particular, we model the motion primitives as
hybrid automata and verify their safety through formulating as Differential
Dynamic Logic (d$\mathcal{L}$). Furthermore, these proven safe motion
primitives are composed based on an encoding to Satisfiability Modulo Theories
(SMT) that takes into account the geometric constraints. Since d$\mathcal{L}$
allows compositional verification, the sequential composition of the safe
motion primitives also preserves safety properties. Therefore, the CoSMoP
generates correct plans for given task specifications that are formally proven
safe even for moving obstacles. Illustrative examples are presented to show the
effectiveness of the methods.

the impact of hadronic medium rescattering is almost unnoticeable on the

of evolving magnetic fields adjacent to a pore. By utilising wavelet analysis,
we study for the first time, how the oscillatory properties in this region
change as the magnetic field evolves with time. Image sequences taken in the
blue continuum, G-band, Ca~\textsc{ii}~K and H$\alpha$ filters were used in
this study. It is observed that the suppression found in the chromosphere
occupies a relatively larger area confirming previous findings. Also, the
suppression is extended to structures directly connected to the magnetic region
and is found to get enhanced as the magnetic field strength increased with
time. The dependence of the suppression on the magnetic field strength is
greater at longer periods and higher formation heights. Furthermore, the
dominant periodicity in the chromosphere was found to be anti-correlated with
increases in the magnetic field strength.

comprehensive microscopic and spectroscopic analysis, this approach is shown to
yield phosphorene dispersions that are stable, highly concentrated, and
comparable to micromechanically exfoliated phosphorene in structure and
chemistry. Due to the high exfoliation efficiency of this process, the
resulting phosphorene flakes are thinner than anhydrous organic solvent
dispersions, thus allowing the observation of layer-dependent photoluminescence
down to the monolayer limit. Furthermore, to demonstrate preservation of
electronic properties following solution processing, the aqueous-exfoliated
phosphorene flakes are employed in field-effect transistors with high drive
currents and current modulation ratios. Overall, this method enables the

systems, with no direct parallels in wireless communications. While chemical
reactions may be used inside the transmitter nodes, receiver nodes or the
communication medium, we focus on its utility in the medium in this paper. Such
chemical reactions can be used to perform computation over the medium as
molecules diffuse and react with each other (physical-layer computation). We
propose the use of chemical reactions for the following purposes: (i) to reduce
signal-dependent observation noise of receivers by reducing the signal density,
(ii) to realize molecular physical-layer network coding (molecular PNC) by
performing the natural XOR operation inside the medium, and (iii) to reduce the
inter-symbol interference (ISI) of other transmitters by canceling out the
remaining molecules from previous transmissions. To make the ideas formal, we
consider an explicit two-way relaying example with a transparent receiver
(which has a signal-dependent noise). The proposed ideas are used to define a
modulation scheme (which we call the PNC scheme). We compare the PNC with a
previously proposed scheme for this problem where the XOR operation is

quantitatively, as long as light frequency $\omega$ is neither too close to nor
too far from resonance frequency $\Omega$. Polarizability and absorption cross
section are derived for the Lorentz atom by purely classical reasoning and
shown to agree with quantum-mechanical calculations of the same quantities. In
particular, oscillator parameters $\Omega,\,\Gamma$ deduced by treating the

evolution and fundamental tracers of cosmic distances. While rotational mixing
significantly affects the evolution of Cepheid progenitors (intermediate-mass
stars), the impact of the resulting changes in stellar structure and
composition on Cepheids on their pulsational properties is hitherto unknown.
Here we present the first detailed pulsational instability analysis of stellar
evolution models that include the effects of rotation, for both fundamental
mode and first overtone pulsation. We employ Geneva evolution models spanning a
three-dimensional grid in mass (1.7 - 15 $M_\odot$), metallicity (Z = 0.014,
0.006, 0.002), and rotation (non-rotating, average & fast rotation). We
determine (1) hot and cool instability strip (IS) boundaries taking into
account the coupling between convection and pulsation, (2) pulsation periods,
and (3) rates of period change. We investigate relations between period and (a)
luminosity, (b) age, (c) radius, (d) temperature, (e) rate of period change,
(f) mass, (g) the flux-weighted gravity-luminosity relation (FWGLR). We
confront all predictions aside from those for age with observations, finding
generally excellent agreement. We tabulate period-luminosity relations (PLRs)
for several photometric pass-bands and investigate how the finite IS width,
different IS crossings, metallicity, and rotation affect PLRs. We show that a
Wesenheit index based on H, V, and I photometry is expected to have the
smallest intrinsic PLR dispersion. We confirm that rotation resolves the
Cepheid mass discrepancy. Period-age relations depend significantly on rotation
(rotation increases Cepheid ages), offering a straightforward explanation for
evolved stars in binary systems that cannot be matched by conventional
isochrones assuming a single age. Finally, we show that Cepheids obey a tight
FWGLR.

constrained minimization with distance majorization. If $f(\boldsymbol{x})$ is
the loss function, and $C$ is the constraint set in a constrained minimization
problem, then the proximal distance principle mandates minimizing the penalized
loss $f(\boldsymbol{x})+\frac{\rho}{2}\mathop{dist}(x,C)^2$ and following the
solution $\boldsymbol{x}_{\rho}$ to its limit as $\rho$ tends to $\infty$. At
each iteration the squared Euclidean distance
$\mathop{dist}(\boldsymbol{x},C)^2$ is majorized by the spherical quadratic $\|
\boldsymbol{x}-P_C(\boldsymbol{x}_k)\|^2$, where $P_C(\boldsymbol{x}_k)$
denotes the projection of the current iterate $\boldsymbol{x}_k$ onto $C$. The
minimum of the surrogate function
$f(\boldsymbol{x})+\frac{\rho}{2}\|\boldsymbol{x}-P_C(\boldsymbol{x}_k)\|^2$ is
given by the proximal map $\mathop{prox}_{\rho^{-1}f}[P_C(\boldsymbol{x}_k)]$.
The next iterate $\boldsymbol{x}_{k+1}$ automatically decreases the original
penalized loss for fixed $\rho$. Since many explicit projections and proximal
maps are known, it is straightforward to derive and implement novel
optimization algorithms in this setting. These algorithms can take hundreds if
not thousands of iterations to converge, but the stereotyped nature of each
iteration makes proximal distance algorithms competitive with traditional
algorithms. For convex problems, we prove global convergence. Our numerical
examples include a) linear programming, b) nonnegative quadratic programming,
c) projection to the closest kinship matrix, d) projection onto a second-order
cone constraint, e) calculation of Horn's copositive matrix index, f) linear
complementarity programming, and g) sparse principal components analysis. The

also be employed as an effective interference mitigation technique, especially

varying propagation profiles, we argue that it is not necessary, indeed even
harmful, to transmit at maximum power at all carriers, at all times. Rather, by
using game theory, we design a distributed algorithm that lets eNodeBs and
micro base stations dynamically adjust the downlink transmit power for the

$c_{\rm s,(DM)}^2 < 10^{-10.7}$ and $c_{\rm vis, (DM)}^{2} < 10^{-10.3}$ at the
$99\%$ confidence level. This very general bound can be translated to
model-dependent constraints on dark-matter models: for warm dark matter these
constraints imply $m> 70$ eV, assuming it decoupled while relativistic around
the same time as the neutrinos; for a cold relic, we show that $m>100$ eV. We
separately constrain the properties of the DM fluid on linear scales at late
times, and find upper bounds $c_{\rm s, (DM)}^2<10^{-5.9}$, $c_{\rm vis,
(DM)}^{2} < 10^{-5.7}$, with no detection of non-dust properties for the DM.

Charon. Pluto's encounter hemisphere shows ongoing surface geological activity
centered on a vast basin containing a thick layer of volatile ices that appears
to be involved in convection and advection, with a crater retention age no
greater than $\approx$10 Ma. Surrounding terrains show active glacial flow,
apparent transport and rotation of large buoyant water-ice crustal blocks, and
pitting, likely by sublimation erosion and/or collapse. More enigmatic features
include tall mounds with central depressions that are conceivably cryovolcanic,
and ridges with complex bladed textures. Pluto also has ancient cratered
terrains up to ~4 Ga old that are extensionally fractured and extensively
mantled and perhaps eroded by glacial or other processes. Charon does not
appear to be currently active, but experienced major extensional tectonism and
resurfacing (probably cryovolcanic) nearly 4 billion years ago. Impact crater
populations on Pluto and Charon are not consistent with the steepest proposed
impactor size-frequency distributions proposed for the Kuiper belt.

  parallel tempering and infinite swapping algorithms","49 pages, 7 figures",,,,"math.PR math.OC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Parallel tempering, or replica exchange, is a popular method for simulating
complex systems. The idea is to run parallel simulations at different
temperatures, and at a given swap rate exchange configurations between the
parallel simulations. From the perspective of large deviations it is optimal to
let the swap rate tend to infinity and it is possible to construct a
corresponding simulation scheme, known as infinite swapping. In this paper we
propose a novel use of large deviations for empirical measures for a more
detailed analysis of the infinite swapping limit in the setting of continuous
time jump Markov processes. Using the large deviations rate function and
associated stochastic control problems we consider a diagnostic based on
temperature assignments, which can be easily computed during a simulation. We
show that the convergence of this diagnostic to its a priori known limit is a
necessary condition for the convergence of infinite swapping. The rate function
is also used to investigate the impact of asymmetries in the underlying
potential landscape, and where in the state space poor sampling is most likely
to occur.

electromagnetic charges and scalar fields with different kinds of boundary
conditions. We perform our analysis in the canonical ensemble, where we find a
first order phase transition for a suitable range of charges and angular
momentum. We perform the thermodynamic stability check on the configurations.
Using the holographic dictionary we interpret the phase transition in terms of
expectation values of operators in the dual field theory, which pertains to the
class of ABJM theories living on a rotating Einstein universe. We extend the
analysis to dyonic configurations as well. Lastly, we show the computation of
the on-shell action and mass via holographic renormalization techniques.

approximation obtained by Galerkin projection is the solution of a reduced
dynamical system with a modified flux which takes into account the time
dependency of the reduced spaces. An a posteriori error estimate is derived and
a greedy algorithm using this error estimate is proposed for the adaptive

dynamical low-rank approximation method with a subspace point of view and a
uniform control of the error over the parameter set.

problem in massive data analysis. Singer-Wu proposed the vector diffusion map
which embeds manifolds into the Hilbert space $l^2$ using eigenvectors of

problem. Specifically, we use eigenvector fields to construct local coordinate
charts with low distortion, and show that the distortion constants depend only
on geometric properties of manifolds with metrics in the little H\""{o}lder
space $c^{2,\alpha}$. Next, we use the coordinate charts to embed the entire
manifold into a finite dimensional Euclidean space. The proof of the results
relies on solving the elliptic system and provide estimates for eigenvector

results for eigenvector field under the $c^{2,\alpha}$ perturbation.

20~M_{\odot}~yr^{-1}$) $z\sim 5.5$ galaxies for which the [CII]158$\mu$m line
has been previously obtained with ALMA. We first fit each line with a Gaussian
function and compute the residuals by subtracting the best fitting model from
the data. We combine the residuals of all sample galaxies and find that the
total signal is characterised by a flux excess of $\sim 0.5$ mJy extended over
$\sim 1000$ km~s$^{-1}$. Although we cannot exclude that part of this signal is
due to emission from faint satellite galaxies, we show that the most probable
explanation for the detected flux excess is the presence of broad wings in the
[CII] lines, signatures of starburst-driven outflows. We infer an average
outflow rate of $\rm \dot{M}=54\pm23~ M_{\odot}~yr^{-1}$, providing a loading
factor $\eta=\rm \dot{M}/SFR=1.7\pm1.3$ in agreement with observed local
starbursts. Our interpretation is consistent with outcomes from zoomed

outflow rate $\rm \dot{M}\sim 30~ M_{\odot}~yr^{-1}$. The quality of the ALMA

individual galaxies. Nevertheless, our results suggest that starburst-driven
outflows are in place in the EoR and provide useful indications for future ALMA

better characterise feedback at high-$z$ and to understand the role of outflows

sources limits their average dust mass to $\lesssim6$ Lunar masses

find a positive correlation between $M_{\rm dust}$ and $M_{\ast}$, and present
the first evidence for a positive correlation between $M_{\rm gas}$ and
$M_{\ast}$, which may explain the dependence of giant planet frequency on host
star mass. The mean dust mass in Lupus is 3$\times$ higher than in Upper Sco,
while the dust mass distributions in Lupus and Taurus are statistically
indistinguishable. Most detected disks have $M_{\rm gas}\lesssim1~M_{\rm Jup}$

unless CO is very depleted, the inferred gas depletion indicates that planet

molecular mass, the $z=0.101$ galaxy has a low star formation rate, implying a
large gas consumption timescale, larger than that typical of late-type
galaxies. Most of the molecular gas is hence likely to be in a diffuse extended
phase, rather than in dense molecular clouds. By combining the results of
emission and absorption studies, we find that the strongest molecular
absorption component toward the quasar cannot arise from the molecular disk,
but is likely to arise from diffuse gas in the galaxy's circumgalactic medium.
Our results emphasize the potential of combining molecular and stellar emission
line studies with optical absorption line studies to achieve a more complete

lensed by foreground galaxies (mu_870um > 2), with a median magnification

distribution of DSFGs is relatively narrow. We use the source sizes to
constrain the wavelength at which the dust optical depth is unity and find this
wavelength to be correlated with the dust temperature. This correlation leads
to discrepancies in dust mass estimates of a factor of 2 compared to estimates

multiple investigators. This approach postulates that star forming regions and
clusters are an evolutionary sequence which can be modeled with assumptions
about the coupling between protostars and accretion disks, angular momentum
loss from magnetized winds that saturates in a mass-dependent fashion at high
rotation rates, and core-envelope decoupling for solar analogs. We test this
approach by combining established data with the large h Per dataset from the
MONITOR project and new low-mass Pleiades data. We confirm prior results that
young low-mass stars can be used to test star-disk coupling and angular
momentum loss independent of the treatment of internal angular momentum
transport. For slow rotators, we confirm the need for star-disk interactions to
evolve the ONC to older systems, using h Per (age 13~Myr) as our natural
post-disk case. Further interactions are not required to evolve slow rotators
from h Per to older systems, implying no justification for extremely long-lived
disks as an alternative to core-envelope decoupling. However, our wind models
cannot evolve rapid rotators from h Per to older systems consistently; this
appears to be a general problem for any wind model that becomes ineffective in
low-mass young stars. We outline two possible solutions: either there is cosmic
variance in the distribution of stellar rotation rates in different clusters or
there are substantially enhanced torques in low-mass rapid rotators. We favor
the former explanation and discuss observational tests that could be used to
distinguish them. If the distribution of initial conditions depends on
environment, models which test parameters by assuming a universal underlying
distribution of initial conditions will need to be re-evaluated.

determine with high precision the Y, Mg, and Fe abundances for a sample of 88

widths and a line-by-line differential method within a 1D LTE framework.
Stellar parameters and iron abundances were measured in Paper I of this series
for all stars, but a few (three) required a small revision. The [Y/Mg] ratio
shows a strong correlation with age. It has a slope of -0.041$\pm$0.001 dex/Gyr

relation first proposed by Nissen (2015). We found some outliers that turned
out to be binaries where mass transfer may have enhanced the yttrium abundance.
Given a precise measurement of [Y/Mg] with typical error of 0.02 dex in solar

quadratic Hamiltonians featuring both short- and long-range interactions. The
spreading of correlations in the presence of algebraic decaying interactions,
$1/R^\alpha$, is studied for lattice Bose models in arbitrary dimension $D$.
These models are exactly solvable and provide useful insight in the universal
description of more complex systems as well as comparisons to the known
universal upper bounds for the spreading of correlations. Using analytical
calculations of the dominant terms and full numerical integration of all
quasi-particle contributions, we identify three distinct dynamical regimes. For
strong decay of nteractions, $\alpha>D+1$, we find a causal regime,
qualitatively similar to what previously found for short-range interactions.
This regime is characterized by ballistic (linear cone) spreading of the
correlations with a cone velocity equal to twice the maximum group velocity of
the quasi-particles. For weak decay of interactions, $\alpha<D$, we find
instantaneous activation of correlations at arbitrary distance. This signals
the breaking of causality, which can be associated with the divergence of the
quasi-particle energy spectrum. Finite-size scaling of the activation time
precisely confirms this interpretation. For intermediate decay of interactions,
$D<\alpha<D+1$, we find a sub-ballistic, algebraic (bent cone) spreading and
determine the corresponding exponent as a function of $\alpha$. These outcomes
generalize existing results for one-dimensional systems to arbitrary dimension.
We precisely relate the three regimes to the first- and second-order
divergences of the quasi-particle energy spectrum for any dimension.

measuring the spatial fluctuations in the combined emission, in some convenient
spectral line, from individually unresolved galaxies. An important systematic
concern for these surveys is line confusion from foreground or background
galaxies emitting in other lines that happen to lie at the same observed
frequency as the ""target"" emission line of interest. We develop an approach to
separate this ""interloper"" emission at the power spectrum level. If one adopts
the redshift of the target emission line in mapping from observed frequency and
angle on the sky to co-moving units, the interloper emission is mapped to the
wrong co-moving coordinates. Since the mapping is different in the line of
sight and transverse directions, the interloper contribution to the power
spectrum becomes anisotropic, especially if the interloper and target emission
are at widely separated redshifts. This distortion is analogous to the
Alcock-Paczynski test, but here the warping arises from assuming the wrong
redshift rather than an incorrect cosmological model. We apply this to the case
of a hypothetical [CII] emission survey at z~7 and find that the distinctive
interloper anisotropy can, in principle, be used to separate strong foreground
CO emission fluctuations. In our models, however, a significantly more
sensitive instrument than currently planned is required, although there are
large uncertainties in forecasting the high redshift [CII] emission signal.
With upcoming surveys, it may nevertheless be useful to apply this approach
after first masking pixels suspected of containing strong interloper
contamination.

at the neutron time of flight facility n_TOF at CERN. The total number of
$^{12}$B nuclei produced per neutron pulse of the n_TOF beam was determined
using the activation technique in combination with a time of flight technique.
The cross section is integrated over the n_TOF neutron energy spectrum from
reaction threshold at 13.6 MeV to 10 GeV. Having been measured up to 1 GeV on
basis of the $^{235}$U(n,f) reaction, the neutron energy spectrum above 200 MeV
has been reevaluated due to the recent extension of the cross section reference
for this particular reaction, which is otherwise considered a standard up to
200 MeV. The results from the dedicated GEANT4 simulations have been used to
evaluate the neutron flux from 1 GeV up to 10 GeV. The experimental results
related to the $^{12}$C(n,p)$^{12}$B reaction are compared with the evaluated
cross sections from major libraries and with the predictions of different
GEANT4 models, which mostly underestimate the $^{12}$B production. On the
contrary, a good reproduction of the integral cross section derived from

for a long time and then, almost suddenly, attracts a lot of attention (is
awakened by a prince). In our foregoing study we found that roughly half of the
Sleeping Beauties are application-oriented and thus are potential Sleeping
Innovations. In this paper we investigate a new topic: Sleeping Beauties that
are cited in patents. In this way we explore the existence of a dormitory of
inventions. We find that patent citation may occur before or after the
awakening and that the depth of the sleep, i.e., citation rate during the
sleeping period, is no predictor for later scientific or technological impact
of the Sleeping Beauty. Inventor-author self-citations occur only in a small
minority of the Sleeping Beauties that are cited in patents, but other types of
inventor-author links occur more frequently. We analyze whether they deal with
new topics by measuring the time-dependent evolution in the entire scientific
literature of the number of papers related to both the precisely defined topics
as well as the broader research theme of the Sleeping Beauty during and after
the sleeping time. We focus on the awakening by analyzing the first group of
papers that cites the Sleeping Beauty. Next, we create concept maps of the
topic-related and the citing papers for a time period immediately following the
awakening and for the most recent period. Finally, we make an extensive
assessment of the cited and citing relations of the Sleeping Beauty. We find
that tunable co-citation analysis is a powerful tool to discover the prince and
other important application-oriented work directly related to the Sleeping
Beauty, for instance papers written by authors who cite Sleeping Beauties in
both the patents of which they are the inventors, as well as in their

the specular reflection boundary value problems for Boltzmann equation with

law. For the diffuse reflection boundary condition, based on an $L^2$ argument
and its interplay with intricate $L^\infty$ analysis for the linearized
Boltzmann equation, we first establish the global existence and then obtain the
exponential decay in $L^\infty$ space for the nonlinear Boltzmann equation in
general classes of bounded domain. It turns out that the zero lower bound of
the collision frequency and the singularity of the collision kernel lead to
some new difficulties for achieving the {\it a priori} $L^\infty$ estimates and
time decay rates of the solution. In the course of the proof, we capture some
new properties of the probability integrals along the stochastic cycles and
improve the $L^2-L^\infty$ theory to give a more direct approach to overcome
those difficulties. As to the specular reflection condition, our key
contribution is to develop a new time-velocity weighted $L^\infty$ theory so
that we could deal with the greater difficulties stemmed from the complicated
velocity relations among the specular cycles and the zero lower bound of the
collision frequency. From this new point, we are also able to prove the
solutions of the linearized Boltzmann equation tend to equilibrium
exponentially in $L^\infty$ space with the aid of the $L^2$ theory and a
bootstrap argument. These methods in the latter case can be applied to the
Boltzmann equation with soft potential for all other types of boundary

structure, dynamics, and some thermodynamic quantities are invariant in reduced
units. A substantial part of their phase diagrams is thus effectively one
dimensional. The shape of these isomorphs is described by a material-dependent
function of density $h(\rho)$, which for real liquids is well approximated by a
power law $\rho^\gamma$. However, in simulations, a power law is not adequate
when density changes are large; typical models such as the Lennard-Jones liquid
show that $\gamma(\rho) \equiv \mathrm{d} \ln h(\rho)/\mathrm{d} \ln \rho$ is a
decreasing function of density. This paper presents results from computer
simulations using a new pair potential that diverges at a nonzero distance and
can be tuned to give a more realistic shape of $\gamma(\rho)$. Our results
indicate that the finite size of molecules is an important factor to take into

numerically solving the EEG forward problem and they enable the realistic
modeling of complex geometries and important conductive features such as
anisotropic conductivities. To date, most of the presented approaches rely on
the same underlying formulation, the continuous Galerkin (CG)-FEM. In this
article, a novel approach to solve the EEG forward problem based on a mixed
finite element method (Mixed-FEM) is introduced. To obtain the Mixed-FEM
formulation, the electric current is introduced as an additional unknown
besides the electric potential. As a consequence of this derivation, the
Mixed-FEM is, by construction, current preserving, in contrast to the CG-FEM.
Consequently, a higher simulation accuracy can be achieved in certain
scenarios, e.g., when the diameter of thin insulating structures, such as the
skull, is in the range of the mesh resolution.
  A theoretical derivation of the Mixed-FEM approach for EEG forward
simulations is presented, and the algorithms implemented for solving the
resulting equation systems are described. Subsequently, first evaluations in
both sphere and realistic head models are presented, and the results are
compared to previously introduced CG-FEM approaches. Additional visualizations
are shown to illustrate the current preserving property of the Mixed-FEM.
  Based on these results, it is concluded that the newly presented Mixed-FEM
can at least complement and in some scenarios even outperform the established
CG-FEM approaches, which motivates a further evaluation of the Mixed-FEM for
applications in bioelectromagnetism.

bounding box annotations. Our framework takes a markedly different direction:
we transfer tracked object boxes from weakly-labeled videos to weakly-labeled
images to automatically generate pseudo ground-truth boxes, which replace
manually annotated bounding boxes. We first mine discriminative regions in the
weakly-labeled image collection that frequently/rarely appear in the
positive/negative images. We then match those regions to videos and retrieve
the corresponding tracked object boxes. Finally, we design a hough transform
algorithm to vote for the best box to serve as the pseudo GT for each image,
and use them to train an object detector. Together, these lead to
state-of-the-art weakly-supervised detection results on the PASCAL 2007 and
2010 datasets.

reordering of the time loop of time-domain forward/adjoint wave propagation
solvers combined with the use of a memory buffer. It avoids instabilities that
occur when time-reversing dissipative wave propagation simulations. The total
number of required time steps is unchanged compared to usual acoustic or
elastic approaches. The cost is reduced by a factor of 4/3 compared to the case
in which anelasticity is partially accounted for by accommodating the effects
of physical dispersion. We validate our technique by performing a test in which
we compare the $K_\alpha$ sensitivity kernel to the exact kernel obtained by
saving the entire forward calculation. This benchmark confirms that our
approach is also exact. We illustrate the importance of including full
attenuation in the calculation of sensitivity kernels by showing significant
differences with physical-dispersion-only kernels.

jets originated from a location with emerging and canceling magnetic field at
the southeast edge of the giant active region (AR) of 2014 October, NOAA 12192.
This AR produced in its interior many non-jet major flare eruptions (X and M
class) that made no CME. During 20-27 October, in contrast to the major-flare
eruptions in the interior, six of the homologous jets from the edge resulted in
CMEs. Each jet-driven CME( ~200-300 kms) was slower-moving than most CMEs; had
angular width (20-50 degree) comparable to that of the base of a coronal
streamer straddling the AR; and was of the `streamer-puff' variety, whereby the
preexisting streamer was transiently inflated but not destroyed by the passage
of the CME. Much of the transition-region-temperature plasma in the
CME-producing jets escaped from the Sun, whereas relatively more of the
transition-region plasma in non-CME-producing jets fell back to the solar
surface. Also, the CME-producing jets tended to be faster and longer-lasting
than the non-CME-producing jets. Our observations imply: each jet and CME
resulted from reconnection opening of twisted field that erupted from the jet
base; and the erupting field did not become a plasmoid as previously envisioned
for streamer-puff CMEs, but instead the jet-guiding streamer-base loop was
blown out by the loop's twist from the reconnection.

principal cause of negative color gradients in the low-mass SFGs, while both
increased central dust reddening and buildup of compact old bulges are likely
the origins of negative color gradients in the high-mass SFGs. These findings
also imply that at these redshifts the low-mass SFGs buildup their stellar

birefringent segment and is transformed into a regular scalar soliton after the
polarizer within the laser cavity. The existence of solutions in a
polarization-dependent cavity comprising a periodic combination of two distinct
nonlinear waves is novel and likely to be applicable to various other nonlinear
systems. For very large local birefringence, our laser approaches the working
regime of vector soliton lasers, while it approaches scalar soliton fiber
lasers under the conditions of very small birefringence.

performed a statistical examination of the twin-CME scenario with a total of
$126$ fast and wide western Coronal Mass Ejections (CMEs). They found that CMEs
having a preceding CME with a speed $>$ 300 $km/s$ within $9$ hours from the
same active region have larger probability of leading to large SEP events than
CMEs that do not have preceding CMEs. The choice of $9$ hours being the time
lag $\tau$ between the preceding CME and the main CME was based on some crude
estimates of the decay time of the turbulence downstream of the shock driven by
the preceding CME. In this work, we examine this choice. For the $126$ fast
wide CMEs examined in Ding.etal2013, we vary the time lag $\tau$ from $1$ hour
to $24$ hours with an increment of $1$ hour. By considering three quantities
whose values depend on the choice of this time lag $\tau$, we show that the
choice of $13$ hours for $\tau$ is more appropriate. Our study confirms our
earlier result that twin CMEs are more likely to lead to large SEP events than
single fast CMEs. The results shown here are of great relevance to space

minimum energy cost. Recently, Vaccaro and Barnett (VB) explored information
erasure within the context of generalized Gibbs ensembles and demonstrated that
for energy-degenerate spin reservoirs, the cost of erasure can be solely in
terms of a minimum amount of spin angular momentum and no energy. As opposed to
the Landauer case, the cost of erasure in this case is associated with the
discrete variable.
  Here we study the {\it discrete} fluctuations in this cost and the
probability of violation of the VB bound. We also obtain a Jarzynski-like
equality for the VB erasure protocol. We find that the fluctuations below the
VB bound are exponentially suppressed at a far greater rate and more tightly
than for an equivalent Jarzynski expression for VB erasure. We expose a
trade-off between the size of the fluctuations and the cost of erasure. We find
that the discrete nature of the fluctuations is pronounced in the regime where
reservoir spins are maximally polarized. We also state the first laws of
thermodynamics corresponding to the conservation of spin angular momentum for
this particular erasure protocol. Our work will be important for novel heat
engines based on information erasure schemes that do not incur an energy cost.

adjacent lattices in the orthogonal directions are different, which gives rise
to a linearly anisotropic system. We find that when the polarized orientation

importance of video annotating as an effective method for research that is as

trigger higher learning and engagement but research struggles to explain the
absence of video annotation in contemporary structures of education practice.
In both academic and informal settings the use of video playback as a
meaningful tool of analysis is apparent, yet the availability of supplementary
annotation software is not within obvious grasp or even prevalent in
standardized computer software. Practical software tools produced by the
researcher have demonstrated effective video annotation in a short development

argues that video annotation is an accessible tool, not just for academic

becoming a mainstream learning tool. This paper thus presents a practical
multimodal public approach to video research that potentially affords a deeper

introduce an ""inquiry dependent"" (ID) metric of model-data comparison that
determines the relative importance of the TOGA-TAO buoy observations of the
ocean temperature, salinity, and horizontal currents for influencing
upper-ocean vertical turbulent mixing as represented by the K-Profile
Parameterization (KPP) embedded in the MIT general circulation model (MITgcm)
for the 2004-2007 time period. The ID metric addresses a challenge that the
wind forcing is likely a more significant source of uncertainty for the ocean
state than the turbulence itself, and that the observations are correlated in
time, space, and across ocean state variables. In this approach the MITgcm is
used to infer variability and relationships in and among the data, and to
determine the response structures that are most relevant for constraining
uncertain parameters. We demonstrate that the ID metric is able to distinguish
the effects due to parameter perturbations from those due to uncertain winds
and that it is important to include multiple kinds of data in the comparison,
suggesting that the ID metric is appropriate for use in a calibration of the

that UV-irradiation provides favorable conditions for steady-state production
of CH$^+$ in this environment. Surprisingly, no spatial or kinematic
correspondences of these species are found with H$_2$ S(1) emission tracing
shocked gas in the outflow. We propose that C$^+$ is being consumed by rapid
production of CO to explain the lack of C$^+$ and CH$^+$ in the outflow, and
that fluorescence provides the reservoir of H$_2$ excited to higher
ro-vibrational and rotational levels. Hence, in star-forming environments
containing sources of shocks and strong UV radiation, a description of CH$^+$
formation and excitation conditions is incomplete without including the
important --- possibly dominant --- role of UV irradiation.

general result, these satellites remain intrinsically fast-rotating oblate
stellar systems since their infall as early as $z=2$; mis-identifications as
slow rotators often arise due to a bar/spiral lifecycle which plays an integral

tailored for PNC to ensure reliable packet delivery; 4) an interface to the

general-purpose processors in PC through an SDR platform rather than ASIC or

sliding-frequency mode caused by the divergent waves and a constant-frequency

speed on the two linear components. We use a simple weakly nonlinear theory to
identify higher order effects in a spectrogram and, while the high speed ferry

color images, previous or next frames, depth image inpainting is quite
challenging. One natural solution is to regard the image as a matrix and adopt
the low rank regularization just as inpainting color images. However, the low
rank assumption does not make full use of the properties of depth images.
  A shallow observation may inspire us to penalize the non-zero gradients by
sparse gradient regularization. However, statistics show that though most
pixels have zero gradients, there is still a non-ignorable part of pixels whose
gradients are equal to 1. Based on this specific property of depth images , we
propose a low gradient regularization method in which we reduce the penalty for
gradient 1 while penalizing the non-zero gradients to allow for gradual depth
changes. The proposed low gradient regularization is integrated with the low
rank regularization into the low rank low gradient approach for depth image
inpainting. We compare our proposed low gradient regularization with sparse
gradient regularization. The experimental results show the effectiveness of our

electroosmosis stands as one of the efficient flow actuation method through
narrow confinement. In the present study, we explore the electrically actuated
flow of a nematic fluid with ionic inclusions taking into account the
influences from surface induced elastic and electrical double layer phenomena.
Influence of surface effects on the flow characteristics is known to get
augmented in micro-confined environment and must be properly addressed. Towards
this, we devise the coupled flow governing equations from fundamental free
energy analysis considering the contributions from first and second-order
elastic, dielectric, flexoelectric, ionic and entropic energies. We have
further considered weak anchoring surface conditions with second order
elasticity which helps us to more accurately capture the director deformations
along the boundaries. The present study focuses on the influence of surface
charge and elasticity effects in the resulting linear electroosmosis through a
slit-type microchannel whose surface are considered to be chemically treated in
order to display a homeotropic-type weak anchoring state. An optical periodic
stripe configuration of the nematic director has been observed especially for
higher electric fields wherein the Ericksen number for the dynamic study is
restricted to the order of unity.

to minimize the total time to satisfy the average demands in cached-enabled
Hetnets with wireless backhaul. We formulate this problem as a mixed
discrete-continuous optimization for given bandwidth and cache resources.
First, we characterize the structure of the optimal solution. Specifically, we
show that the optimal caching is to store the most popular files at each pico
BS, and the optimal user association has a threshold form. We also obtain the
closed-form optimal solution in the homogenous scenario of pico cells. Then, we
analyze the impact of bandwidth and cache resources on the minimum total time

resonances in periodically patterned magnetic films for the detection of
adsorbed magnetic particles with diameters ranging from 6 nm to 4 $\mu$m. The
nanopatterned films contain arrays of holes which can act as preferential
adsorption sites for small particles. Hole-localized particles act in unison to
shift the resonant frequencies of the various modes of the patterned layer with
shift polarities determined by the localization of each mode within the
nanopattern's repeating unit cell. The same polarity shifts are observed for a
large range of coverages, even when hole-localized particles are covered by
quasi-continuous particle sheets. For large particles however, preferential
adsorption no longer occurs, leading to resonance shifts with polarities which
are independent of the mode localization. Analogous shifts are seen in
continuous layers where, for small particles, the shift of the layer's
fundamental mode is typically about 10 times less than in patterned systems and
induced by relatively weak fields emanating beyond the particle in the
direction of the static applied field. This highlights the importance of having
confined modes consistently positioned with respect to nearby particles.

telescopes. Here we present a new approach for visualising and studying
field-aligned irregularities (FAIs), which involves transforming
interferometric measurements of TEC gradients onto a magnetic shell tangent
plane. This removes the perspective distortion associated with the oblique
viewing angle of the irregularities from the ground, facilitating the
decomposition of dynamics along and across magnetic field lines. We apply this
transformation to the dataset of Loi et al. [2015a], obtained on 15 October
2013 by the Murchison Widefield Array (MWA) radio telescope and displaying
prominent FAIs. We study these FAIs in the new reference frame, quantifying
field-aligned and field-transverse behaviour, examining time and altitude
dependencies, and extending the analysis to FAIs on sub-array scales. We show
that the inclination of the plane can be derived solely from the data, and
verify that the best-fit value is consistent with the known magnetic
inclination. The ability of the model to concentrate the fluctuations along a
single spatial direction may find practical application to future calibration
strategies for widefield interferometry, by providing a compact representation

central star grows by accretion from the disk, and irradiation by the central
star heats up the disk and generates thermal wind, which results in the disk
dispersal. We calculate the evolution of protoplanetary disks from their parent
pre-stellar cores to dispersal of the disks. We find that the disk lifetimes of
typical pre-stellar cores are around 2--4 million years (Myr). A pre-stellar
core with high angular momentum forms a larger disk whose lifetime is long,
while a disk around a X-ray luminous star has a short lifetime. Integrating the
disk lifetimes under various mass and angular velocity of prestellar cores and
X-ray luminosities of young stellar objects, we obtain disk fraction at a given
stellar age and mean lifetime of the disks. Our model indicates that the mean
lifetime of protoplanetary disks is 3.7 Myr, which is consistent with the
observational estimate from young stellar clusters. We also find that the

unknown. Relating the flow on these planets to perturbations in their density
field is key to the analysis of the gravity measurements expected from both the
Juno (Jupiter) and Cassini (Saturn) spacecrafts during 2016-17. Both missions
will provide latitude-dependent gravity fields, which in principle could be
inverted to calculate the vertical structure of the observed cloud-level zonal
flow on these planets. Theories to date connecting the gravity field and the
flow structure have been limited to potential theories under a barotropic
assumption, or estimates based on thermal wind balance that allow analyzing
baroclinic wind structures, but have made simplifying assumptions. Those
include the effects of the deviations from spherical symmetry, the centrifugal
force due to density perturbations, and self-gravitational effects of the
density perturbations. Recent studies attempted to include some effects but not
in a self-consistent manner. The present study introduces such a
self-consistent perturbation approach to the thermal wind balance that
incorporates all physical effects, and applies it to several example wind
structures, both barotropic and baroclinic. The contribution of each term is
analyzed, and the results are compared in the barotropic limit to those of
potential theory. It is found that the dominant balance involves the original
simplified thermal wind approach. This balance produces a good
order-of-magnitude estimate of the gravitational moments, and is able,
therefore, to address the order one question of how deep the flows are given
measurements of gravitational moments. The additional terms are significantly
smaller and none of these terms is dominant, so any approximation attempting to
improve over the simplified thermal wind approach needs to include all other
terms.

achieved by adding a global energy term to the labeling energy function, and it

variability observables and identify their most common problems. Equipped with
this knowledge, we study ~9000 r-band AGN light curves from Stripe 82 of the
Sloan Digital Sky Survey, using SFs described by stochastic processes with the
power exponential covariance matrix of the signal. We model the ""subensemble""
SFs in the redshift-absolute magnitude bins with the full SF equation
(including the turnover and the noise part) and a single power law (SPL; in the
""red noise regime"" after subtracting the noise term). The distribution of
full-equation SF (SPL) slopes peaks at gamma = 0.55 +/- 0.08 (0.52 +/- 0.06)
and is consistent with the DRW model. There is a hint of a weak correlation of
gamma with the luminosity and a lack of correlation with the black hole mass.
The typical decorrelation timescale in the optical is tau = 0.97 +/- 0.46 year.
The SF amplitude at one year obtained from the SPL fitting is SF_0 = 0.22 +/-
0.06 mag and is overestimated because the SF is already at the turnover part,
so the true value is SF_0 = 0.20 +/- 0.06 mag. The asymptotic variability is
SF_\infty = 0.25 +/- 0.06 mag. It is strongly anticorrelated with both the
luminosity and the Eddington ratio and is correlated with the black hole mass.
The reliability of these results is fortified with Monte Carlo simulations.

on the Drude-plasma issue that turns up when one considers thermal corrections
to the Casimir force. The problem is that the plasma model, although leaving
out dissipation in the material, apparently gives the best agreement with
recent experiments. We consider a dielectric plate separated from a dielectric
half-space by a vacuum gap, both media being similar. We consider the following
categories: (1) Making use of the statistical mechanical method developed by
H{\o}ye and Brevik (1998), implying that the quantized electromagnetic field is
replaced by interaction between dipole moments oscillating in harmonic
potentials, we first verify that the Casimir force is in agreement with the
Drude prediction. No use of Fresnel's reflection coefficients is made at this
stage. (2) Then turning to the field theoretical description implying use of
the reflection coefficients, we derive results in agreement with the forgoing
when first setting the frequency equal to zero, before letting the permittivity
becoming large. With the plasma relation the reflection coefficient for TE zero
frequency modes depend on the component of the wave vector parallel to the
surfaces and lies between 0 and 1. This contradicts basic electrostatic theory.
(3) Turning to high permeability magnetic materials the TE zero frequency mode
describes the static magnetic field in the same way as the TM zero frequency
modes describe the static electric fields in electrostatics. With the plasma
model magnetic fields, except for a small part, can not pass through metals.
i.e.~metals effectively become superconductors. However, recent experimental
results clearly favor the plasma model. We shortly discuss a possible
explanation for this apparent conflict with electrostatics.

understand a certain deformation of the commutative product on the symmetric
tensor algebra over a given (locally convex) Lie algebra in a topological
setting. Therefore, the tensor algebra over the Lie algebra is topologized in a
locally convex manner. This finally provides a new example of a strict
deformation quantization, i.e. a continuous star product. The related formal
star product was found by Simone Gutt and is therefore called the Gutt star
product. Together with this star product, the symmetric tensor algebra is
isomorphic to the universal enveloping algebra of the Lie algebra. Hence, this
work also presents an explicit locally convex topology on the universal
enveloping algebra of certain locally convex Lie algebras. Since this
construction has good functorial properties, it is also an interesting object
of study not only in quantization and quantum group theory, but also in Lie
theory.

tokamak. Towards, the edge, however, the field lines begin to intersect
physical surfaces, leading to interaction between neutral and ionised
particles, and the potential melting of the material surface. Simulation of
this interaction is important for predicting the performance and lifetime of
future tokamak devices such as ITER. Field-aligned coordinates are commonly
used in the simulation of tokamak plasmas due to the geometry and magnetic
topology of the system. However, these coordinates are limited in the geometry
they allow in the poloidal plane due to orthogonality requirements. A novel 3D
coordinate system is proposed herein that relaxes this constraint so that any
arbitrary, smoothly varying geometry can be matched in the poloidal plane while
maintaining a field-aligned coordinate. This system is implemented in BOUT++
and tested for accuracy using the method of manufactured solutions. A MAST edge
cross-section is simulated using a fluid plasma model and the results show
expected behaviour for density, temperature, and velocity. Finally, simulations
of an isolated divertor leg are conducted with and without neutrals to
demonstrate the ion-neutral interaction near the divertor plate and the
corresponding beneficial decrease in plasma temperature.

introduced for vector space categories over fields and make heavily use of the
tensor product. As first generalisations, these notions were formulated for
monoidal categories, with braidings if needed. The present authors developed a
theory of bimonads and Hopf monads $H$ on arbitrary categories $\mathbb{A}$,
employing distributive laws, allowing for a general form of the Fundamental
Theorem for Hopf algebras. For $\tau$-bimonads $H$, properties of braided
(Hopf) bialgebras were captured by requiring a Yang-Baxter operator $\tau:HH\to
HH$. The purpose of this paper is to extend the features of weak (Hopf)
bialgebras to this general setting including an appropriate form of the
Fundamental Theorem. This subsumes the theory of braided Hopf algebras (based
on weak Yang-Baxter operators) as considered by Alonso \'Alvarez and others.

($0.71<z<1.19$) and higher ($1.90<z<3.15$) redshifts, which correspond to the
continuum slopes at longer (NUV) and shorter (FUV) rest wavelength ranges
respectively. Overall, the average continuum slopes are $-0.36$ and $-0.51$ for
$\alpha_{\rm NUV}$ and $\alpha_{\rm FUV}$ with similar dispersions
$\sigma_{\alpha} \sim 0.5$. For both samples, we confirm the luminosity
dependence of the continuum slope, i.e., fainter quasars have redder spectra.
We further find that both $\alpha_{\rm NUV}$ and $\alpha_{\rm FUV}$ have a
common upper limit ($\sim 1/3$) which is almost independent of the quasar
luminosity $L_{\rm bol}$. This finding implies that the intrinsic quasar
continuum (or the bluest quasar), at any luminosity, obey the standard thin
disk model. We propose that the other quasars with redder $\alpha$ are caused
by the reddening from the dust {\it locally}. With this assumption, we employ
the dust extinction scenario to model the observed $L_{\rm bol}-\alpha$
relation. We find that, a typical value of $E(B-V)\sim0.1$ to $0.3$ mag
(depending on the types of extinction curve) of the quasar {\it local} dust is

We hypothesize that a hardware implementation will be able not only to extend
the already practical uses of these ideas to broader scenarios but also to
exploit the hardware-friendly CLA characteristics. The architecture proposed
will enable an unfeasible scalability for software solutions and will fully

use a packet-switched network to tackle this. The paper addresses the
fundamental issues of such an approach, proposing solutions to achieve scalable

architecture techniques and tools. The results obtained suggest that even with
CMOS technology, under constrained cost, it might be possible to implement a

hybrid radial-vertical Richardson number. We propose an equilibrium profile
with temperature depending on the radial and vertical coordinates and with
$Ri_z>0$ for which this destabilization mechanism occurs. We notice as well
that the dispersion relation of the ""convective overstability"" is the branch of
the one here discussed in the limit $|k_z|\gg|k_x|$ (i. e. two-dimensional

firstly, it operates in completely learning free paradigm which is very
different from unsupervised learning methods, secondly, the computational time

capable of adaptation in the azimuth only. Recently, the trend is to enhance
system performance by exploiting the channel's degrees of freedom in the
elevation, which necessitates the characterization of 3D channels. We present
an information-theoretic channel model for MIMO systems that supports the
elevation dimension. The model is based on the principle of maximum entropy,
which enables us to determine the distribution of the channel matrix consistent
with the prior information on the angles. Based on this model, we provide
analytical expression for the cumulative density function (CDF) of the mutual
information (MI) for systems with a single receive and finite number of
transmit antennas in the general signal-to-interference-plus-noise-ratio (SINR)
regime. The result is extended to systems with finite receive antennas in the
low SINR regime. A Gaussian approximation to the asymptotic behavior of MI
distribution is derived for the large number of transmit antennas and paths
regime. We corroborate our analysis with simulations that study the performance
gains realizable through meticulous selection of the transmit antenna downtilt
angles, confirming the potential of elevation beamforming to enhance system
performance. The results are directly applicable to the analysis of 5G
3D-Massive MIMO-systems.

out-of-plane spin texture in thin films, and can be phenomenologically viewed
as a coalition of two topological magnetic skyrmions with opposite topological
numbers. Due to its zero topological number ($Q=0$) and doughnut-like
structure, the skyrmionium has its distinctive characteristics as compared to
the skyrmion with $Q=\pm 1$. Here we systematically study the generation,
manipulation and motion of a skyrmionium in ultrathin magnetic nanostructures
by applying a magnetic field or a spin-polarized current. It is found that the
skyrmionium moves faster than the skyrmion when they are driven by the
out-of-plane current, and their velocity difference is proportional to the
driving force. However, the skyrmionium and skyrmion exhibit an identical
current-velocity relation when they are driven by the in-plane current. It is
also found that a moving skyrmionium is less deformed in the current-in-plane
geometry compared with the skyrmionum in the current-perpendicular-to-plane
geometry. Furthermore we demonstrate the transformation of a skyrmionium with
$Q=0$ into two skyrmions with $Q=+1$ in a nanotrack driven by a spin-polarized
current, which can be seen as the unzipping process of a skyrmionium. We
illustrate the energy and spin structure variations during the skyrmionium
unzipping process, where linear relations between the spin structure and
energies are found. These results could have technological implications in the
emerging field of skyrmionics.

dimensional statistics. The Linearized Bregman Algorithm is a simple iterative
procedure to generate sparse regularization paths of model estimation, which
are rstly discovered in applied mathematics for image restoration and
particularly suitable for parallel implementation in large scale problems. The
limit of such an algorithm is a sparsity-restricted gradient descent ow, called
the Inverse Scale Space, evolving along a par- simonious path of sparse models
from the null model to over tting ones. In sparse linear regression, the
dynamics with early stopping regularization can provably meet the unbiased
Oracle estimator under nearly the same condition as LASSO, while the latter is
biased. Despite their successful applications, statistical consistency theory
of such dynamical algorithms remains largely open except for some recent
progress on linear regression. In this tutorial, algorithmic implementations in
the package are discussed for several widely used sparse models in statistics,
including linear regression, logistic regres- sion, and several graphical
models (Gaussian, Ising, and Potts). Besides the simulation examples, various
application cases are demonstrated, with real world datasets from diabetes,

(DR1) from Hi-GAL, the {\em Herschel} infrared Galactic Plane Survey. Hi-GAL is
the keystone of a suite of continuum Galactic Plane surveys from the near-IR to
the radio, and covers five wavebands at 70, 160, 250, 350 and 500 micron,
encompassing the peak of the spectral energy distribution of cold dust for 8 <
T < 50K. This first Hi-GAL data release covers the inner Milky Way in the
longitude range 68{\deg} > l > -70{\deg} in a |b|<1{\deg} latitude strip.
Photometric maps have been produced with the ROMAGAL pipeline, that optimally
capitalizes on the excellent sensitivity and stability of the bolometer arrays
of the {\em Herschel} PACS and SPIRE photometric cameras, to deliver images of
exquisite quality and dynamical range, absolutely calibrated with {\em Planck}
and {\em IRAS}, and recovering extended emission at all wavelengths and all
spatial scales. The compact source catalogues have been generated with the
CuTEx algorithm, specifically developed to optimize source detection and
extraction in the extreme conditions of intense and spatially varying
background that are found in the Galactic Plane in the thermal infrared. Hi-GAL
DR1 images will be accessible via a dedicated web-based image cutout service.
The DR1 Compact Source Catalogues are delivered as single-band photometric
lists containing, in addition to source position, peak and integrated flux and
source sizes, a variety of parameters useful to assess the quality and
reliability of the extracted sources, caveats and hints to help this assessment
are provided. Flux completeness limits in all bands are determined from
extensive synthetic source experiments and depend on the specific line of sight
along the Galactic Plane. Hi-GAL DR1 catalogues contain 123210, 308509, 280685,
160972 and 85460 compact sources in the five bands, respectively.

magnetic field, finally resulting in a metal-to-insulator-like transition. With
temperature further decreased, a resistivity plateau emerges after the
insulator-like regime. At low temperature (2.5 K) and high field (14 T), the
transverse magnetoresistance (MR) is quite large (3.47 $\times 10^4\%$ ). In
addition, Shubnikov-de Haas (SdH) oscillation has also been observed in YSb.
Periodic behavior of the oscillation amplitude reveals the related information
about Fermi surface and two major oscillation frequencies can be obtained from
the FFT spectra of the oscillations. The trivial Berry phase extracted from SdH
oscillation, band structure revealed by angle-resolved photoemission
spectroscopy (ARPES) and first-principles calculations demonstrate that YSb is

beam. Whereas this concept is known for light beam, here, we show how to
realize it for massive-particle wave function of a free electron. We
experimentally demonstrate an electron central spot of radius 106 pm, which is
more than two times smaller than the diffraction limit of the experimental
setup used. In addition, we demonstrate that this central spot can be
structured by adding orbital angular momentum to it. The resulting
super-oscillating vortex beam has a smaller dark core with respect to the
regular vortex beam. This new family of electron beams having hot-spots with
arbitrarily small features and tailored structure can be useful for studying
electron-matter interactions with sub-atomic resolution.

generally considered a nuisance. We instead treat motion blur as a useful
signal that allows to compute the motion of objects from a single image.
Drawing on the success of joint segmentation and parametric motion models in
the context of optical flow estimation, we propose a parametric object motion
model combined with a segmentation mask to exploit localized, non-uniform
motion blur. Our parametric image formation model is differentiable w.r.t. the
motion parameters, which enables us to generalize marginal-likelihood
techniques from uniform blind deblurring to localized, non-uniform blur. A
two-stage pipeline, first in derivative space and then in image space, allows
to estimate both parametric object motion as well as a motion segmentation from
a single image alone. Our experiments demonstrate its ability to cope with very
challenging cases of object motion blur.

transition-metal dichalcogenide monolayers $\mathrm{MX_2}$ (M=Zr, Hf, Mo, W and

Boltzmann transport theory, including spin-orbital coupling (SOC). It is found
that the gap decrease increases from S to Te in each cation group, when the SOC
is opened. The spin-orbital splitting has the same trend with gap reducing.
Calculated results show that SOC has noteworthy detrimental effect on p-type
power factor, while has a negligible influence in n-type doping except W cation
group, which can be understood by considering the effects of SOC on the valence
and conduction bands. For $\mathrm{WX_2}$ (X=S, Se and Te), the SOC leads to
observably enhanced power factor in n-type doping, which can be explained by
SOC-induced band degeneracy, namely bands converge. Among all cation groups, Pt
cation group shows the highest Seebeck coefficient, which leads to best power
factor, if we assume scattering time is fixed. Calculated results show that
$\mathrm{MS_2}$ (M=Zr, Hf, Mo, W and Pt) have best p-type power factor for all

cases for data layout performance exploration. The experiments show that having
structure along the extruded direction enables the cost of the indirect data
accesses to be amortized after 10-20 layers as long as the underlying mesh is

representative set of both continuous-Galerkin and discontinuous-Galerkin

achieved is between 70% and 90% of a theoretical hardware-specific limit.

subject of controversy as to whether the Au-induced nanowires do indeed host
exotic, 1D metallic states. We report on a thorough study of the electronic
properties of high quality nanowires formed at the Au/Ge(100) surface. High
resolution ARPES data show the low-lying Au-induced electronic states to
possess a dispersion relation that depends on two orthogonal directions in
k-space. Comparison of the E(k$_x$,k$_y$) surface measured using ARPES to
tight-binding calculations yields hopping parameters in the two different
directions that differ by a factor of two. We find that the larger of the two
hopping parameters corresponds, in fact, to the direction perpendicular to the
nanowires (t$_{\perp}$). This, the topology of the $E$=$E_F$ contour in
k$_{\||}$, and the fact that $t_{\||}$/$t_{\perp}\sim 0.5$ proves that the
Au-induced electron pockets possess a 2D, closed Fermi surface, this firmly
places the Au/Ge(100) nanowire system outside being a potential hosts of a
Tomonaga-Luttinger liquid. We combine these ARPES data with STS measurements of
the spatially-resolved electronic structure and find that the spatially
straight conduction channels observed up to energies of order one electron volt
below the Fermi level do not originate from the Au-induced states seen in the
ARPES data. The former are more likely to be associated with bulk Ge states
that are localized to the subsurface region. Despite our proof of the 2D nature
of the Au-induced nanowire and sub-surface Ge-related states, an anomalous
suppression of the density of states at the Fermi level is observed in both the
STS and ARPES data, this phenomenon is discussed in the light of the effects of

Namely, mathematical properties of C*-algebras modelling quantum systems are
equivalent to constraints that are information-theoretic in nature: (1)
noncommutativity of subalgebras is equivalent to impossibility of signalling;
(2) noncommutativity of the whole algebra is equivalent to impossibility of
broadcasting; (3) the existence of entangled states is implied by the
impossibility of secure bit commitment (with the converse conjectured).
However, the C*-algebraic framework has drawn criticism as it already contains
much of themathematical structure of quantum theory such as complex linearity.
We address this issue by a generalising C*-algebras categorically. In this
framework, equivalence (1) holds, equivalence (2) becomes a strict implication,
and implication (3) fails in general. Thus we identify exactly what work is

match accurately with those from satellite observations. Standing, oscillating

the advective component. The post-shock region acts as the Compton cloud
producing the power-law spectra. Jets and outflows are also produced from this
post-shock region, commonly known as the CENtrifugal barrier supported BOundary

the Keplerian disk, and thus the outflow is absent. Type-C and Type-B QPOs are
generated respectively due to strong and weak resonance oscillations of the

is required. Up to now such a fixed ultimate optimal escape path for a known
shape for any starting position is only known for some special convex shapes
(i.e., circles, strips of a given width, fat convex bodies, some isosceles

path, the so-called certificate path. This escape path depends on the starting
position s and takes the distances from s to the outer boundary of the
environment into account. Due to the additional information, the certificate
path always (for any position s) leaves the environment earlier than the
ultimate escape path, in the above convex examples. Next we assume that fewer

and sheared by a pressure-driven gas flow along the channel centre is studied.
The films are susceptible to a long-wavelength instability, whose dynamic
behaviour is found - for sufficiently low Reynolds numbers and thick gas layers
- to be described by two coupled non-linear partial differential equations. To
the best of our knowledge, such coupled fully non-linear equations for the film
thicknesses have not been derived previously. A linear stability analysis
conducted under the condition that the material properties and the initial
undisturbed liquid film thicknesses are equal can be utilized to determine
whether the interfaces are predominantly destabilized by the variations of the
shear stress or by the pressure gradient acting upon them. The analysis of the
weakly non-linear equations performed for this case shows that instabilities
corresponding to a vanishing Reynolds number are absent from the system.
Moreover, for this configuration, the patterns emerging along the two
interfaces are found to be identical in the long-time limit, implying that the
films are fully synchronized. A different setup, where the liquid films have
identical material properties but their undisturbed thicknesses differ, is
studied numerically. The results show that even for this configuration the
interfacial waves remain phase-synchronized and closely correlated for a broad
range of parameters. These findings are particularly relevant for multiphase
flow in narrow ducts, for example in the respiratory system or in microfluidic

successfully used as basic building blocks in deep artificial neural networks

also as density estimators. Thus, their generative and discriminative
capabilities, but also their computational time are instrumental to a wide
range of applications. Our main contribution is to look at RBMs from a
topological perspective, bringing insights from network science. Firstly, here
we show that RBMs and Gaussian RBMs (GRBMs) are bipartite graphs which
naturally have a small-world topology. Secondly, we demonstrate both on
synthetic and real-world datasets that by constraining RBMs and GRBMs to a
scale-free topology (while still considering local neighborhoods and data
distribution), we reduce the number of weights that need to be computed by a
few orders of magnitude, at virtually no loss in generative performance.
Thirdly, we show that, for a fixed number of weights, our proposed sparse
models (which by design have a higher number of hidden neurons) achieve better
generative capabilities than standard fully connected RBMs and GRBMs (which by
design have a smaller number of hidden neurons), at no additional computational
costs.

five sources can be adequately fit with absorbed, optically thin thermal plasma
models, with either single- or multi-temperature plasmas. These models are
compatible with the X-ray emission originating in the boundary layer between an
accretion disk and a white dwarf. The high plasma temperatures of kT$~>3$ keV
for all five targets were greater than expected for colliding winds. Based on
these high temperatures, as well as previous measurements of UV variability and
UV luminosity, and the large amplitude of X-ray flickering in 4 Dra, we
conclude that all five sources are accretion-powered through predominantly
optically thick boundary layers. Our X-ray data allow us to observe a small,
optically thin portion of the emission from these boundary layers. Given the
time between previous observations and these observations, we find that the
intrinsic X-ray flux and the intervening absorbing column can vary by factors
of three or more on a time scale of years. However, the location of the
absorber and the relationship between changes in accretion rate and absorption
are still elusive.

equation predicts wave damping due to wave-particle interaction, where the
resonant velocity shifted from the phase velocity by a velocity $v_q = \hbar
k/2m$. Here $\hbar$ is the reduced Planck constant, $k$ is the wavenumber and
$m$ is the electron mass. Going beyond linear theory, we find additional
resonances with velocity shifts $n v_q$, $n = 2, 3, \ldots$, giving rise to a
new wave-damping mechanism that we term \emph{multi-plasmon damping}, as it can
be seen as the simultaneous absorption (or emission) of multiple plasmon
quanta. Naturally this wave damping is not present in classical plasmas. For a
temperature well below the Fermi temperature, if the linear ($n = 1$) resonant
velocity is outside the Fermi sphere, the number of linearly resonant particles
is exponentially small, while the multi-plasmon resonances can be located in
the bulk of the distribution. We derive sets of evolution equations for the
case of two-plasmon and three-plasmon resonances for Langmuir waves in the
simplest case of a fully degenerate plasma. By solving these equations
numerically for a range of wave-numbers we find the corresponding damping
rates, and we compare them to results from linear theory to estimate the
applicability. Finally, we discuss the effects due to a finite temperature.

employing Gabor scale-space and filter-bank analysis for tag extrema
segmentation and triangulated surface fitting aided by Gabor filter bank
derived surface normals. Deformation is derived following tracking of tag
surface triplet triangle intersections. The dynamic deformation measurements
were validated using indentation tests (~20 mm deep at 12 mm/s) on a silicone
gel soft tissue phantom containing contrasting markers which provide a
reference measure of deformation. In addition, the techniques were evaluated
in-vivo for dynamic skeletal muscle tissue deformation measurement during
indentation of the biceps region of the upper arm in a volunteer.

  graphs via low treewidth pattern covering",,,,,"cs.DS","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We prove the following theorem. Given a planar graph $G$ and an integer $k$,
it is possible in polynomial time to randomly sample a subset $A$ of vertices
of $G$ with the following properties: (i) $A$ induces a subgraph of $G$ of
treewidth $\mathcal{O}(\sqrt{k}\log k)$, and (ii) for every connected subgraph
$H$ of $G$ on at most $k$ vertices, the probability that $A$ covers the whole
vertex set of $H$ is at least $(2^{\mathcal{O}(\sqrt{k}\log^2 k)}\cdot
n^{\mathcal{O}(1)})^{-1}$, where $n$ is the number of vertices of $G$.
  Together with standard dynamic programming techniques for graphs of bounded
treewidth, this result gives a versatile technique for obtaining (randomized)
subexponential parameterized algorithms for problems on planar graphs, usually
with running time bound $2^{\mathcal{O}(\sqrt{k} \log^2 k)}
n^{\mathcal{O}(1)}$. The technique can be applied to problems expressible as
searching for a small, connected pattern with a prescribed property in a large
host graph, examples of such problems include Directed $k$-Path, Weighted
$k$-Path, Vertex Cover Local Search, and Subgraph Isomorphism, among others. Up
to this point, it was open whether these problems can be solved in
subexponential parameterized time on planar graphs, because they are not
amenable to the classic technique of bidimensionality. Furthermore, all our
results hold in fact on any class of graphs that exclude a fixed apex graph as
a minor, in particular on graphs embeddable in any fixed surface.

genome sequencing and genetic variation experiments, as well as by storing all

indexes for locating all the exact occurrences of a pattern in a

However, multiple, distinct measures of repetition all grow sublinearly in the
length of a highly-repetitive string. In this paper we explore the practical
advantages of combining data structures whose size depends on distinct measures
of repetition. The main ingredient of our structures is the run-length encoded
BWT (RLBWT), which takes space proportional to the number of runs in the
Burrows-Wheeler transform of a string. We describe a range of practical
variants that combine RLBWT with the set of boundaries of the Lempel-Ziv 77
factors of a string, which take space proportional to the number of factors.
Such variants use, respectively, the RLBWT of a string and the RLBWT of its
reverse, or just one RLBWT inside a bidirectional index, or just one RLBWT with
support for unidirectional extraction. We also study the practical advantages
of combining RLBWT with the compact directed acyclic word graph of a string, a
data structure that takes space proportional to the number of one-character
extensions of maximal repeats. Our approaches are easy to implement, and
provide competitive tradeoffs on significant datasets.

interactions, stellar mass losses, friction and gravitational drag forces, mass
accretion and evaporation on/by the planet. Stellar rotation modifies the
structure of the star and therefore the way these different processes occur.
Changes of the orbits, at their turn, have an impact on the rotation of the
star.
  Aims. Models accounting in a consistent way for these interactions between
the orbital evolution of the planet and the evolution of the rotation of the
star are still missing. The present work is a first attempt to fill this gap.
  Methods. We compute the evolution of stellar models including a comprehensive
treatment of rotational effects together with the evolution of planetary
orbits, so that the exchanges of angular momentum between the star and the
planetary orbit are treated in a self-consistent way. The evolution of the
rotation of the star accounts for the angular momentum exchange with the planet
and also follows the effects of the internal transport of angular momentum and
chemicals.
  Results. We show that rotating stellar models without tidal interactions can
well reproduce the surface rotations of the bulk of the red giants. However,
models without any interactions cannot account for fast rotating red giants in
the upper part of the red giant branch, where, such models, whatever the
initial rotation considered on the ZAMS, always predict very low velocities.
For those stars some interaction with a companion is highly probable and the
present rotating stellar models with planets confirm that tidal interaction can
reproduce their high surface velocities. We show also that the minimum distance
between the planet and the star on the ZAMS that will allow the planet to avoid
engulfment and survive is decreased around faster rotating stars. [abridged]

If the region of integration is the unit cube, we obtain the same optimal

that the optimal order of convergence in the latter case is $n^{-s-1/2}$ for
$p\ge2$, which is, in contrast to the case of deterministic algorithms,

tiling algebras, introduced by Coelho Simoes and Parsons. We present a
combinatorial model for torsion pairs using polyogonal subdivisions of a convex
polygon. We use this model and the lattice theory to classify 2-term
simple-minded collections in the bounded derived category of the corresponding
tiling algebra. As a consequence, we obtain a characterization of c-matrices
for any quiver mutation-equivalent to a type A Dynkin quiver.
  Our model is developed using the dual tree of a polygonal subdivision. Given
such a tree, we introduce a simplicial complex of noncrossing geodesics
supported by the tree which we call the noncrossing complex. The facets of the
noncrossing complex may be given the structure of an oriented flip graph.
Special cases of the oriented flip graphs that may be expressed in this way
include the Tamari order, type A Cambrian orders, oriented exchange graphs for
quivers mutation-equivalent to a path quiver. We prove that the oriented flip
graph of any noncrossing complex is a polygonal, congruence-uniform lattice. To
do so, we express the oriented flip graph as a lattice quotient of a lattice of
biclosed sets.
  The facets of the noncrossing complex have an alternate ordering known as the
shard intersection order. We prove that this shard intersection order is
isomorphic to a lattice of noncrossing tree partitions. The oriented flip graph
inherits a cyclic action from its congruence-uniform structure. On noncrossing
tree partitions, this cyclic action generalizes the classical Kreweras
complementation on noncrossing set partitions. We show that the data of a
noncrossing tree partition and its Kreweras complement is equivalent to a
2-term simple-minded collection of the associated tiling algebra.

astrophysical objects that are the size of a galaxy or larger are not enough to
generate the measured motions which they supposedly determine. This is
typically attributed to the existence of dark matter, which possesses mass but
does not radiate (or absorb radiation). Alternatively, the mismatch can be
explained if the underlying dynamics is not Newtonian. Within this conceptual
scheme, Modified Newtonian Dynamics (MOND) is a successful theoretical
paradigm. MOND is usually expressed in terms of a nonlinear Poisson equation,
which is difficult to analyse for arbitrary matter distributions. We study the
MONDian gravitational field generated by slightly non-spherically symmetric
mass distributions based on the fact that both Newtonian and MONDian fields are
conservative (which we refer to as the compatibility condition). As the
non-relativistic version of MOND has two different formulations (AQUAL and
QuMOND) and the compatibility condition can be expressed in two ways, there are
four approaches to the problem in total. The method involves solving a suitably
defined linear deformation potential, which generally depends on the choice of
MOND interpolation function. However, for some specific form of the deformation
potential, the solution is independent of the interpolation function.

processes time-changed by an inverse stable subordinator whose index equals the
order of the fractional time derivative. Some applications are given, to
demonstrate how to specify a well-posed Dirichlet problem for space-time
fractional diffusions in one or several variables. This solves an open problem
in numerical analysis.

nonperturbative renormalization group equation (NPRGE), which is a first order
nonlinear partial differential equation (PDE). In case that the spontaneous
chiral symmetry breaking occurs, the NPRGE encounters some non-analytic
singularities at the finite critical scale even though the initial function is
continuous and smooth. Therefore there is no usual solution of the PDE beyond
the critical scale. In this paper, we newly introduce the notion of a weak
solution which is the global solution of the weak NPRGE. We show how to
evaluate the physical quantities with the weak solution.

  Mechanism","6 pages, 6 figures",,,,"cs.SY","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Artificial Immune Systems(AIS) have been widely used in different fields,
such as control, robotics, computer science and multi-agent systems. In this
paper is proposed a new approach of neural immune PD type tracking control
combining artificial immune control with neural network. It is assumed that the
output of the helper T-cell is concerned with not only the error of system but
also its changing rate, while the output of suppressor T-cell is unknown
nonlinear function with respect to the amount and changing rate of antigens and
the changing rate of antibodies, which is approximated by the output of neural
network. From this, we derive neural immune PD type control law and apply it to
the trajectory tracking of DC actuating mechanism. The validity of the proposed
method is verified by simulation and the simulation results show that this
method can follow the desired trajectory more rapidly and more accurately
compared to the previous method.

connecting two elastic rods along their length. The resulting structure has
interesting shapes that can be stabilized by tuning the material properties of

equilibrium equations describing unloaded states can be derived from a
variational principle. We then use a novel geometric method to study the
stability of the resulting equilibria. As an example we apply the theory to
establish the stability of all possible equilibria of the Bristol ladder.

mathematical analysis that has found important applications in engineering and
science. It addresses methods of assigning natural values to divergent sums,
whose prototypical examples include the Abel summation method, the Cesaro
means, and Borel summability method. In this paper, we introduce a new
summability method for divergent series, and derive an asymptotic expression to
its error term. We show that it is both regular and linear, and that it arises
quite naturally in the study of local polynomial approximations of analytic
functions. Because the proposed summability method is conceptually simple and
can be implemented in a few lines of code, it can be quite useful in practice
for computing the values of divergent sums.

theoretically and numerically in this letter and are shown to exhibit
extraordinary transmission enhancement when material loss is induced. The
enhanced transmission is due to the enhanced propagating and evanescent wave
modes inside the ADNZ medium thanks to the interplay of near-zero density,
material loss, and high wave impedance matching in the propagation direction.
The equi-frequency contour (EFC) is used to reveal whether the propagating wave
mode is allowed in ADNZ metamaterials. Numerical simulations based on
plate-type acoustic metamaterials with different material losses were performed
to demonstrate collimation enabled by the induced loss in ADNZ media. This work
provides a different way for manipulating acoustic waves.
