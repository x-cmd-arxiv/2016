filters are self-cross convolved by M-fold to instantiate a filter offspring
set. The M-FFC flexibility also permits cross convolution amongst Gabor filters
and other filter banks of profoundly dissimilar traits, e.g., principal
component analysis (PCA) filters, and independent component analysis (ICA)
filters. The 2-FFC of Gabor, PCA and ICA filters thus yields three offspring
sets: (1) Gabor filters solely, (2) Gabor-PCA filters, and (3) Gabor-ICA
filters, to render the learning-free and the learning-based 2-FFC descriptors.
To facilitate a sensible Gabor filter selection for M-FFC, the 40 multi-scale,
multi-orientation Gabor filters are condensed into 8 elementary filters. Aside
from that, an average histogram pooling operator is employed to leverage the
2-FFC histogram features, prior to the final whitening PCA compression. The
empirical results substantiate that the 2-FFC descriptors prevail over, or on

methods which do not need class labels utilize a deep autoencoder for binary

an ad-hoc regularization technique. In this study, we explored using a deep
de-noising autoencoder (DDA), with a new unsupervised training scheme using
only backpropagation and dropout, to hash images into binary codes. We
conducted experiments on more than 14,000 x-ray images. By using class labels
only for evaluating the retrieval results, we constructed a 16-bit DDA and a
512-bit DDA independently. Comparing to other unsupervised methods, we
succeeded to obtain the lowest total error by using the 512-bit codes for
retrieval via exhaustive search, and speed up 9.27 times with the use of the
16-bit codes while keeping a comparable total error. We found that our new
training scheme could reduce the total retrieval error significantly by 21.9%.

Often, a specification contains both Boolean requirements that should be

to minimize with respect to a probabilistic environment.
  In this work we study, for the first time, mean-payoff games in which the
system aims at minimizing the expected cost against a probabilistic
environment, while surely satisfying an $\omega$-regular condition against an
adversarial environment. We consider the case the $\omega$-regular condition is
given as a parity objective or by an LTL formula. We show that in general,
optimal strategies need not exist, and moreover, the limit value cannot be
approximated by finite-memory strategies. We thus focus on computing the
limit-value, and give tight complexity bounds for synthesizing
$\epsilon$-optimal strategies for both finite-memory and infinite-memory
strategies.
  We show that our game naturally arises in various contexts of synthesis with
Boolean and multi-valued objectives. Beyond direct applications, in synthesis
with costs and rewards to certain behaviors, it allows us to compute the
minimal sensing cost of $\omega$-regular specifications -- a measure of quality

  We show that `handshake' electron transfer from a highly excited Rydberg atom
to these thin-film states is experimentally measurable. Thicker films, have a
wider 1D box, changing the energetic distribution and image-state contribution
to the thin film wavefunctions, resulting in more resonances. Calculations
successfully predict the number of resonances and the nature of the thin-film
wavefunctions for a given film thickness.

integrated with variance reduction methods for stochastic gradient, leading to

reduced gradient (SVRG). Unlike another recent integration attempt called
SCAS-ADMM, the proposed algorithm retains the fast convergence benefits of
SAG-ADMM and SDCA-ADMM, but is more advantageous in that its storage
requirement is very low, even independent of the sample size $n$. We also
extend the proposed method for nonconvex problems, and obtain a convergence

by the transfer of linear momentum to the electromagnetic vacuum. The vacuum
momentum results from the asymmetric interference of the virtual photons

new magnetic field. Almost at the same time, a burst of hard X-rays was
recorded, and a wave in the vacuum ultraviolet (EUV) range (a ""sunquake"") was
generated due to the impact of the disturbance in the energy release range on
the photosphere. At the beginning of the event, a sigmoid flare was recorded,
but it did not spread, as it usually does, along the polarity inversion

the active region shows that the relationship between them and the occurrence
of flares is very intricate. We have corroborated that the expected ""ideal""

obtained were compared with the observations of two other flares recorded in

fundamental tradeoff between computation and communication in distributed

  More specifically, a general distributed computing framework, motivated by
commonly used structures like MapReduce, is considered, where the overall
computation is decomposed into computing a set of ""Map"" and ""Reduce"" functions
distributedly across multiple computing nodes. A coded scheme, named ""Coded
Distributed Computing"" (CDC), is proposed to demonstrate that increasing the
computation load of the Map functions by a factor of $r$ (i.e., evaluating each
function at $r$ carefully chosen nodes) can create novel coding opportunities
that reduce the communication load by the same factor.
  An information-theoretic lower bound on the communication load is also
provided, which matches the communication load achieved by the CDC scheme. As a
result, the optimal computation-communication tradeoff in distributed computing
is exactly characterized.

in computer vision community. As a novel branch of visual saliency, co-saliency
detection refers to the discovery of common and salient foregrounds from two or
more relevant images, and can be widely used in many computer vision tasks. The
existing co-saliency detection algorithms mainly consist of three components:
extracting effective features to represent the image regions, exploring the
informative cues or factors to characterize co-saliency, and designing
effective computational frameworks to formulate co-saliency. Although numerous
methods have been developed, the literature is still lacking a deep review and
evaluation of co-saliency detection techniques. In this paper, we aim at
providing a comprehensive review of the fundamentals, challenges, and
applications of co-saliency detection. Specifically, we provide an overview of
some related computer vision works, review the history of co-saliency
detection, summarize and categorize the major algorithms in this research area,
discuss some open issues in this area, present the potential applications of
co-saliency detection, and finally point out some unsolved challenges and
promising future works. We expect this review to be beneficial to both fresh

related areas regarding the utility of co-saliency detection algorithms.

we reduce this drift by a factor of $10^3$ to the level of a few kHz over the

size the proposed method reduces computation time of the NDWT by replacing
repetitive convolutions with matrix multiplications. Second, submatrices of an
NDWT matrix can be rescaled, which enables a straightforward inverse transform.
Finally, the method has no constraints on a size of the input signal in one or

two-dimensional signals with non-dyadic sides can be readily transformed. We
provide illustrative examples and a tutorial to assist users in application of

the boundary conditions possess tangential derivatives of the second and fourth
orders. Also, the setting of the problems is complimented by certain edge
conditions at the two vertices of the semi-strip. The problems model wave
propagation in a semi-infinite waveguide with membrane and plate walls. A
technique for the exact solution of these fluid-structure interaction problems
is proposed. It requires application of two Laplace transforms with respect to
both variables with the parameter of the second transform being a certain
function of the first Laplace transform parameter. Ultimately, this method
yields two scalar Riemann-Hilbert problems with the same coefficient and
different right-hand sides. The dependence of the existence and uniqueness
results of the physical model problems on the index of the Riemann-Hilbert
problem is discussed.

foundation of every urban system, transportation system is undeniably a crucial
component in powering the life of the entire urban system. In this work, we
study the spatial pattern of $73$ cities across the globe by analysing the
distribution of public transport points within the cities. The analysis reveals
that different spatial distributions of points could be classified into four
groups with distinct features, indicating whether the points are clustered,
dispersed or regularly distributed. From visual inspection, we observe that the
cities with regularly distributed patterns do not have apparent centre in
contrast to the other two types in which star-node structure, i.e. monocentric,
can be clearly observed. Furthermore, the results provide evidence for the
existence of two different types of urban system: well-planned and organically
grown. We also study the spatial distribution of another important urban
entity, the amenities, and find that it possesses universal properties
regardless of the city's spatial pattern type. This result has one important
implication that at small scale of locality, the urban dynamics cannot be
controlled even though the regulation can be done at large scale of the entire
urban system. The relation between the distribution of amenities within the
city and its spatial pattern is also discussed.

that the treatment propensities are estimable, or that the average treatment

addition standard assumptions used to make lasso regression on the outcome

(C-CD) for minimizing a convex quadratic function, which is equivalent to
Gauss-Seidel method and can be transformed to Kaczmarz method and projection
onto convex sets (POCS). We observe that the known provable complexity of C-CD
can be $O(n^2)$ times slower than randomized coordinate descent (R-CD), but no
example was rigorously proven to exhibit such a large gap. In this paper we
show that the gap indeed exists. We prove that there exists an example for
which C-CD takes at least $O(n^4 \kappa_{\text{CD}} \log\frac{1}{\epsilon})$
operations, where $\kappa_{\text{CD}}$ is related to Demmel's condition number
and it determines the convergence rate of R-CD. It implies that in the worst
case C-CD can indeed be $O(n^2)$ times slower than R-CD, which has complexity
$O( n^2 \kappa_{\text{CD}} \log\frac{1}{\epsilon})$. Note that for this
example, the gap exists for any fixed update order, not just a particular
order. Based on the example, we establish several almost tight complexity
bounds of C-CD for quadratic problems. One difficulty with the analysis is that
the spectral radius of a non-symmetric iteration matrix does not necessarily
constitute a \textit{lower bound} for the convergence rate.
  An immediate consequence is that for Gauss-Seidel method, Kaczmarz method and
POCS, there is also an $O(n^2) $ gap between the cyclic versions and randomized
versions (for solving linear systems). We also show that the classical
convergence rate of POCS by Smith, Solmon and Wager [1] is always worse and
sometimes can be infinitely times worse than our bound.

that the recently discovered gravitational wave source, a pair of two
coalescing black holes, was related to a gamma-ray burst. The observed
high-energy electromagnetic radiation (above 50 keV) originated from a weak
transient source and lasted for about 1 second. Its localization is consistent
with the direction to GW150914. We speculate about the possible scenario for
the formation of a gamma-ray burst accompanied by the gravitational-wave
signal. Our model invokes a tight binary system consisting of a massive star
and a black hole which leads to the triggering of a collapse of the star's
nucleus, the formation of a second black hole, and finally to the binary black
hole merger. For the most-likely configuration of the binary spin vectors with
respect to the orbital angular momentum in the GW150914 event, the recoil speed
(kick velocity) acquired by the final black hole through gravitational wave
emission is of the order of a few hundred km/s and this might be sufficient to
get it closer to the envelope of surrounding material and capture a small
fraction of matter from the remnant of the host star. The gamma-ray burst is
produced by the accretion of this remnant matter onto the final black hole. The
moderate spin of the final black hole suggests that the gamma-ray burst jet is
powered by weak neutrino emission rather than the Blandford-Znajek mechanism,
and hence explains the low power available for the observed GRB signal.

softened by a similarity renormalization group transformation while JISP16 is
adopted without renormalization. The MBPT calculations are performed within the
Hartree-Fock (HF) bases. The angular momentum coupled scheme is used, which can
reduce the computational task. Corrections up to the third order in energy and
up to the second order in radius are evaluated. Higher-order corrections in the
HF basis are small relative to the leading-order perturbative result. Using the
anti-symmetrized Goldstone diagram expansions of the wave function, we directly
correct the one-body density for the calculation of the radius, rather than
calculate corrections to the occupation propabilities of single-particle orbits
as found in other treatments. We compare our results with other methods where
available and find good agreement. This supports the conclusion that our
methods produce reasonably converged results with these interactions. We also
compare our results with experimental data.

converge, along a straight line, to various points on the boundary of the
Slepian-Wolf region at a speed slower than the inverse square root of the
blocklength $n$, while the error probability decays subexponentially fast in
$n$. Our main result focuses on directions of approaches to corner points of
the Slepian-Wolf region. It states that for each correlated source and all
corner points, there exists a non-empty subset of directions of approaches such
that the moderate deviations constant (the constant of proportionality for the

is related to different rate of arriving typical energies at/near substrate

atoms are converted to structure of smooth elements where elongation of atoms
of one-dimensional arrays is as per exerting surface format forces along
opposite poles from their centers. Such tiny grains in the film are the cause
of v1 peak under the investigation of the Raman spectrum because of the
enhanced propagation of input laser signals through channelized inter-state

film which evolved in fullerene state are the cause of v2 peak. The tiny grains
related to v1 peak possess a low intensity as compared to the ones which
comprised atoms having state behaviors known in their exceptional hardness.
Tiny grains representing v1 peak in the Raman spectrum are also the cause of

fundamental packing problems studied in the discrete optimization literature.
It asks for an assignment of $n$ jobs to a set of $m$ identical machines that
minimizes the makespan. The problem is strongly NP-hard, and thus we do not
expect a $(1+\epsilon)$-approximation algorithm with a running time that
depends polynomially on $1/\epsilon$. Furthermore, Chen et al. [3] recently
showed that a running time of $2^{(1/\epsilon)^{1-\delta}}+\text{poly}(n)$ for
any $\delta>0$ would imply that the Exponential Time Hypothesis (ETH) fails. A
long sequence of algorithms have been developed that try to obtain low
dependencies on $1/\epsilon$, the better of which achieves a running time of
$2^{\tilde{O}(1/\epsilon^2)}+O(n\log n)$ [11]. In this paper we obtain an
algorithm with a running time of $2^{\tilde{O}(1/\epsilon)}+O(n\log n)$, which
is tight under ETH up to logarithmic factors on the exponent.
  Our main technical contribution is a new structural result on the
configuration-IP. More precisely, we show the existence of a highly symmetric
and sparse optimal solution, in which all but a constant number of machines are
assigned a configuration with small support. This structure can then be
exploited by integer programming techniques and enumeration. We believe that
our structural result is of independent interest and should find applications
to other settings. In particular, we show how the structure can be applied to
the minimum makespan problem on related machines and to a larger class of
objective functions on parallel machines. For all these cases we obtain an
efficient PTAS with running time $2^{\tilde{O}(1/\epsilon)} + \text{poly}(n)$.

possible causes of the peculiar color-magnitude diagrams (CMDs) of some star
clusters, which exhibit extended main-sequence turn-offs (eMSTOs). It is far
from getting a clear answer. This paper studies the effects of three above
causes on the CMDs of star clusters systematically. A rapid stellar
evolutionary code and a recently published database of rotational effects of
single stars have been used, via an advanced stellar population synthesis
technique. As a result, we find a consistent result for rotation to recent
works, which suggests that rotation is able to explain, at least partially, the
eMSTOs of clusters, if clusters are not too old ($<$ 2.0\,Gyr). In addition, an
age spread of 200 to 500\,Myr reproduces extended turn-offs for all clusters
younger than 2.5\,Gyr, in particular, for those younger than 2.2\,Gyr. Age
spread also results in extended red clumps (eRCs) for clusters younger than
0.5\,Gyr. The younger the clusters, the clearer the eRC structures. Moreover,
it is shown that binaries (including interactive binaries) affect the spread of
MSTO slightly for old clusters, but they can contribute to the eMSTOs of
clusters younger than 0.5\,Gyr. Our result suggests a possible way to
disentangle the roles of stellar rotation and age spread, i.e., checking the
existence of CMDs with both eMSTO and eRC in clusters younger than 0.5\,Gyr.

node in the graph represents a person. One after another, each person has to
take a decision based on a private signal as well as the decisions made by
earlier neighboring nodes. Such information cascades commonly occur in practice
and have been studied in complete graphs where everyone can overhear the
decisions of every other player. It is known that information cascades can be
fragile and based on very little information, and that they have a high
likelihood of being wrong.
  Generalizing the problem to arbitrary graphs reveals interesting insights. In
particular, we show that in a random graph $G(n,q)$, for the right value of
$q$, the number of nodes making a wrong decision is logarithmic in $n$. That
is, in the limit for large $n$, the fraction of players that make a wrong
decision tends to zero. This is intriguing because it contrasts to the two
natural corner cases: empty graph (everyone decides independently based on his
private signal) and complete graph (all decisions are heard by all nodes). In
both of these cases a constant fraction of nodes make a wrong decision in
expectation. Thus, our result shows that while both too little and too much
information sharing causes nodes to take wrong decisions, for exactly the right
amount of information sharing, asymptotically everyone can be right. We further
show that this result in random graphs is asymptotically optimal for any
topology, even if nodes follow a globally optimal algorithmic strategy. Based
on the analysis of random graphs, we explore how topology impacts global
performance and construct an optimal deterministic topology among layer graphs.

spin Hall effects that can be utilized to generate and detect spin currents.
Our $ab~initio$ calculations reveal a large spin Hall conductivity that is
comparable to that of $4d$ and $5d$ transition metals. The spin Hall effect
originates intrinsically from the bulk band structure of Weyl semimetals, which
exhibit a large Berry curvature and spin--orbit coupling, so the bulk carrier
problem in the topological insulators is naturally avoided. Our work not only
paves the way for employing Weyl semimetals in spintronics, but also proposes a
new guideline for searching for the spin Hall effect in various topological

compelling evidence that these fractals are 2D ice. They grow while they are in

Aggregation (DLA). However, DLA requires a low mass density mother phase, in
contrast to the actual currently present high mass density mother phase. Latent
heat effects and consequent transport of heat and molecules are found to be key
ingredients for understanding the evolution of the snow (ice) flakes. We
conclude that not the local availability of water molecules (DLA), but rather
them having the locally required orientation is the key factor for
incorporation into the 2D ice nanocrystal. In combination with the transport of

temperature dependent Rotation Limited Aggregation (RLA). The ice growth occurs

develops a novel framework for clustering problems, which is called Weighted

using modularity, which is a famous metric in the community detection, on the
transformed graph representation of individual clustering results, our approach
provides an effective diversity estimation for individual clustering results.

if there exist $d\times d$ Hermitian positive semidefinite matrices
$\{P_i\}_{i=1}^n$ (for some $d\ge 1$) such that $X_{ij}= {\rm Tr}(P_iP_j),$ for
all $i,j \in \{ 1, \ldots, n \}$. The cpsd-rank of a cpsd matrix is the
smallest $d\ge 1$ for which such a representation is possible. In this work we
initiate the study of the cpsd-rank which we motivate twofold. First, the
cpsd-rank is a natural non-commutative analogue of the completely positive rank
of a completely positive matrix. Second, we show that the cpsd-rank is
physically motivated as it can be used to upper and lower bound the size of a
quantum system needed to generate a quantum behavior.
  In this work we present several properties of the cpsd-rank. Unlike the
completely positive rank which is at most quadratic in the size of the matrix,
no general upper bound is known on the cpsd-rank of a cpsd matrix. In fact, we
show that the cpsd-rank can be exponential in terms of the size. Specifically,
for any $n\ge1,$ we construct a cpsd matrix of size $2n$ whose cpsd-rank is
$2^{\Omega(\sqrt{n})}$. Our construction is based on Gram matrices of Lorentz
cone vectors, which we show are cpsd. The proof relies crucially on the
connection between the cpsd-rank and quantum behaviors. In particular, we use a
known lower bound on the size of matrix representations of extremal quantum
correlations which we apply to high-rank extreme points of the $n$-dimensional
elliptope.
  Lastly, we study cpsd-graphs, i.e., graphs $G$ with the property that every
doubly nonnegative matrix whose support is given by $G$ is cpsd. We show that a
graph is cpsd if and only if it has no odd cycle of length at least $5$ as a
subgraph. This coincides with the characterization of cp-graphs.

function $f$ imply size lower bounds for branching programs computing $f$.
Despite several attempts (Pudl\'ak, R\""odl 1992 ; Babai, R\'{o}nyai, Ganapathy
2000), proving super-linear lower bounds for projective dimension of explicit
families of graphs has remained elusive.
  We show that there exist a Boolean function $f$ (on $n$ bits) for which the
gap between the projective dimension and size of the optimal branching program
computing $f$ (denoted by bpsize$(f)$), is $2^{\Omega(n)}$. Motivated by the
argument in (Pudl\'ak, R\""odl 1992), we define two variants of projective
dimension - projective dimension with intersection dimension 1 (denoted by
upd$(G)$) and bitwise decomposable projective dimension (denoted by
bitpdim$(G)$).
  As our main result, we show that there is an explicit family of graphs on $N

projective dimension with intersection dimension $1$ is $\Omega(n)$ and the
bitwise decomposable projective dimension is $\Omega(\frac{n^{1.5}}{\log n})$.
We also show that there exist a Boolean function $f$ (on $n$ bits) for which
the gap between upd$(G_f)$ and bpsize$(f)$ is $2^{\Omega(n)}$. In contrast, we
also show that the bitwise decomposable projective dimension characterizes size
of the branching program up to a polynomial factor. That is, there exists a
constant $c>0$ and for any function $f$, $\textrm{bitpdim}(G_f)/6 \le
\textrm{bpsize}(f) \le (\textrm{bitpdim}(G_f))^c$. We also study two other
variants of projective dimension and show that they are exactly equal to
well-studied graph parameters - bipartite clique cover number and bipartite

often suffers from an increasing template size if the degree of a template
polynomial is too high.
  We propose a technique to make template-based methods more efficient. Our
technique is based on the following finding: If an algebraic invariant exists,
then there is a specific algebraic invariant that we call a generalized
homogeneous algebraic invariant that is often smaller. This finding justifies
using only a smaller template that corresponds to a generalized homogeneous
algebraic invariant.
  Concretely, we state our finding above formally based on the abstract
semantics of an imperative program proposed by Cachera et al. Then, we modify
their template-based invariant synthesis so that it generates only generalized
homogeneous algebraic invariants. This modification is proved to be sound.
Furthermore, we also empirically demonstrate the merit of the restriction to
generalized homogeneous algebraic invariants. Our implementation outperforms
that of Cachera et al. for programs that require a higher-degree template.

experience a decrease in porosity over time, and may eventually block. As
adsorption will generally be larger towards the entrance of a filter, where the
concentration of contaminant particles is higher, these effects can also result
in a spatially varying porosity. We investigate this dynamic process using an
extension of homogenization theory that accounts for a macroscale variation in
microstructure. We formulate and homogenize the coupled problems of flow
through a filter with a near-periodic time-dependent microstructure, solute
transport due to advection, diffusion, and filter adsorption, and filter
structure evolution due to the adsorption of contaminant. We use the
homogenized equations to investigate how the contaminant removal and filter
lifespan depend on the initial porosity distribution for a unidirectional flow.
We confirm a conjecture made in Dalwadi et al. (2015) that filters with an
initially negative porosity gradient have a longer lifespan and remove more
contaminant than filters with an initially constant porosity, or worse, an
initially positive porosity gradient. Additionally, we determine which initial
porosity distributions result in a filter that will block everywhere at once by
exploiting an asymptotic reduction of the homogenized equations. We show that
these filters remove more contaminant than other filters with the same initial
average porosity, but that filters which block everywhere at once are limited
by how large their initial average porosity can be.

each scenario, we derive an estimator and a variance-optimizing sampling
distribution while retaining the strengths of sampling-based evaluation,

gains in efficiency due to this restriction against losses in fidelity. The
time-dependent variational principle formulated for these states is numerically
very stable. Moreover, it shows significant gains in efficiency compared to the
naively related matrix product states - the evolution or optimisation scales as
$2^{3n}$ for the correlator product states versus $2^{4n}$ for the unrestricted
matrix product state. However, much of this advantage is offset by a
significant reduction in fidelity. Correlator product states break the local
Hilbert space symmetry by the explicit selection of a local basis. We
investigate this dependence in detail and formulate the broad principles under
which correlator product states may be a useful tool. In particular, we find
that scaling with overlap/bond order may be more stable with correlator product
states allowing a more efficient extraction of critical exponents - we present

often assumed. If there is sufficient knowledge on the underlying causal

evaluated by simulation both in a high-dimensional setting where
unconfoundedness holds given $X$ and in a setting where unconfoundedness only
holds given subsets of $X$. Several common target subsets are investigated and
the selected subsets are compared with respect to accuracy in estimating the

software that can easily handle high-dimensional data, in terms of large

show that, if unconfoundedness holds given $X$, this approach is very
successful in selecting the target subsets, outperforming alternative

0.3 dex) across ~5 orders of magnitude in stellar masses. We present a model to
account for this result, whose main principle is that the gas within galaxies
forms a uniform stability disk and that stars form within the molecular gas in
this disk. We test two versions of the model differing in the prescription that
determines the molecular gas fraction, based on either the hydrostatic
pressure, or the stellar surface density of the disk. For high-mass galaxies
such as the Milky Way, we find that either prescription predicts SFE_HI similar
to the observations. However, the hydrostatic pressure prescription is a more
accurate SFE_HI predictor for low-mass galaxies. Our model is the first model
that links the uniform SFE_HI observed in galaxies at low redshifts to
star-forming disks with constant marginal stability. While the rotational
amplitude Vmax is the primary driver of disk structure in our model, we find
the specific angular momentum of the galaxy may play a role in explaining a
weak correlation between SFE_HI and effective surface brightness of the disk.

structures, collectively called the cosmic web. Using the tidal tensor
prescription these structures can be classified into four cosmic environments:
voids, sheets, filaments and knots. As the cosmic web may influence the
formation and evolution of dark matter haloes and the galaxies they host, we
aim to study the effect of these cosmic environments on the average mass of
galactic haloes. To this end we measure the galaxy-galaxy lensing profile of
91,195 galaxies, within 0.039 < z < 0.263, from the spectroscopic Galaxy And
Mass Assembly (GAMA) survey, using ~100 square degrees of overlapping data from
the Kilo-Degree Survey (KiDS). In each of the four cosmic environments we model
the contributions from group centrals, satellites and neighbouring groups to
the stacked galaxy-galaxy lensing profiles. After correcting the lens samples
for differences in the stellar mass distribution, we find no dependence of the
average halo mass of central galaxies on their cosmic environment. We do find a
significant increase in the average contribution of neighbouring groups to the
lensing profile in increasingly dense cosmic environments. We show, however,
that the observed effect can be entirely attributed to the galaxy density at
much smaller scales (within 4 Mpc/h), which is correlated with the density of
the cosmic environments. Within our current uncertainties we find no direct
dependence of galaxy halo mass on their cosmic environment.

a graph. To untangle the latent structure of such signals, one can view them as
outputs of linear graph filters modeling underlying network dynamics. This
paper deals with the problem of joint identification of a graph filter and its
input signal, thus broadening the scope of classical blind deconvolution of
temporal and spatial signals to the less-structured graph domain. Given a graph
signal $\mathbf{y}$ modeled as the output of a graph filter, the goal is to
recover the vector of filter coefficients $\mathbf{h}$, and the input signal
$\mathbf{x}$ which is assumed to be sparse. While $\mathbf{y}$ is a bilinear
function of $\mathbf{x}$ and $\mathbf{h}$, the filtered graph signal is also a
linear combination of the entries of the lifted rank-one, row-sparse matrix
$\mathbf{x} \mathbf{h}^T$. The blind graph-filter identification problem can
thus be tackled via rank and sparsity minimization subject to linear
constraints, an inverse problem amenable to convex relaxations offering
provable recovery guarantees under simplifying assumptions. Numerical tests
using both synthetic and real-world networks illustrate the merits of the
proposed algorithms, as well as the benefits of leveraging multiple signals to
aid the blind identification task.

the case of a boundary layer flow developing above a flat plate exposed to

describe the evolution of turbulent spots a probabilistic cellular automaton is
introduced, with all parameters directly fitted from numerical simulations of
the boundary layer. The nucleation rates are then combined with the cellular

of tweets restricted to a specific country, here we undertake the task in a
broader context by classifying global tweets at the country level, which is so
far unexplored in a real-time scenario. We analyse the extent to which a
tweet's country of origin can be determined by making use of eight
tweet-inherent features for classification. Furthermore, we use two datasets,
collected a year apart from each other, to analyse the extent to which a model
trained from historical tweets can still be leveraged for classification of new
tweets. With classification experiments on all 217 countries in our datasets,
as well as on the top 25 countries, we offer some insights into the best use of
tweet-inherent features for an accurate country-level classification of tweets.
We find that the use of a single feature, such as the use of tweet content
alone -- the most widely used feature in previous work -- leaves much to be
desired. Choosing an appropriate combination of both tweet content and metadata
can actually lead to substantial improvements of between 20\% and 50\%. We
observe that tweet content, the user's self-reported location and the user's
real name, all of which are inherent in a tweet and available in a real-time
scenario, are particularly useful to determine the country of origin. We also
experiment on the applicability of a model trained on historical tweets to
classify new tweets, finding that the choice of a particular combination of
features whose utility does not fade over time can actually lead to comparable
performance, avoiding the need to retrain. However, the difficulty of achieving
accurate classification increases slightly for countries with multiple
commonalities, especially for English and Spanish speaking countries.

X-class flare (SOL2011-09-06T22:20) from observational data of the magnetic
field obtained with HMI. This evolution is compared with that of the flare
ribbons observed in the EUV filters of the AIA. We also compare the observed
electric current density and the flare ribbon morphology with that of the QSLs
computed from the flux rope insertion method/NLFFF model.
  The NLFFF model shows the presence of a fan-spine configuration of overlying
field lines, due to the presence of a parasitic polarity, embedding an
elongated flux rope that appears in the observations as two parts of a
filament. The QSLs, evolved via a magnetofrictional method, also show similar
morphology and evolution as both the current ribbons and the EUV flare ribbons
obtained at several times during the flare. For the first time, we propose a
combined analysis of the photospheric traces of an eruptive flare, in a complex

different and independent approaches, 1) confirm previous results of current
increase during the impulsive phase of the flare, 2) show how NLFFF models can

in recent analog gravity experiments. The main difference concerns the
magnitude of the mode amplification: whereas transcritical flows display a
large amplification (which is generally in good agreement with the Hawking
prediction), this effect is heavily suppressed in subcritical flows. This is
due to the transmission across the obstacle for frequencies less than some
critical value. As a result, subcritical flows display high- and low-frequency
behaviors separated by a narrow band around the critical frequency. In the
low-frequency regime, transmission of long wavelengths is accompanied by
non-adiabatic scattering into short wavelengths, whose spectrum is
approximately linear in frequency. By contrast, in the high-frequency regime,
no simple description seems to exist. In particular, for obstacles similar to
those recently used, we observe that the upstream slope still affects the
scattering on the downstream side because of some residual transmission.

magnetisation dynamics in thin magnetic discs with perpendicular anisotropy are

resonant modes within the disc using direct magnetic eigenmode calculations and
study how their frequencies and profiles are changed by the nanoparticle's
stray magnetic field. We demonstrate that particles can generate shifts in the
resonant frequency of the disc's fundamental mode which exceed resonance
linewidths in recently studied spin torque oscillator devices. Importantly, it
is shown that the simulated shifts can be maintained over large field ranges
(here up to 1T). This is because the resonant dynamics (the basis of
nanoparticle detection here) respond directly to the nanoparticle stray field,
i.e. detection does not rely on nanoparticle-induced changes to the magnetic
ground state of the disk. A consequence of this is that in the case of small
disc-particle separations, sensitivities to the particle are highly mode- and
particle-position-dependent, with frequency shifts being maximised when the
intense stray field localised directly beneath the particle can act on a large
proportion of the disc's spins that are undergoing high amplitude precession.

in an external magnetic field, and the spin-1 antiferromagnetic XXZ model. We
find that continuous GE does not guarantee a continuous phase transition across
a phase transition point. We observe and thus classify three different types of
continuous GE across a phase transition point: (i) GE is continuous with
maximum value at the transition point and the phase transition is continuous,
(ii) GE is continuous with maximum value at the transition point but the phase
transition is discontinuous, and (iii) GE is continuous with non-maximum value
at the transition point and the phase transition is continuous. For the models
under consideration we find that the second and the third types are related to
a point of dual symmetry and a fully polarized phase, respectively.

action instance at a specific location. Accurate and efficient estimation of
actionness is important in video analysis and may benefit other relevant tasks
such as action recognition and action detection. This paper presents a new deep
architecture for actionness estimation, called hybrid fully convolutional
network (H-FCN), which is composed of appearance FCN (A-FCN) and motion FCN
(M-FCN). These two FCNs leverage the strong capacity of deep models to estimate
actionness maps from the perspectives of static appearance and dynamic motion,
respectively. In addition, the fully convolutional nature of H-FCN allows it to
efficiently process videos with arbitrary sizes. Experiments are conducted on
the challenging datasets of Stanford40, UCF Sports, and JHMDB to verify the
effectiveness of H-FCN on actionness estimation, which demonstrate that our
method achieves superior performance to previous ones. Moreover, we apply the
estimated actionness maps on action proposal generation and action detection.
Our actionness maps advance the current state-of-the-art performance of these
tasks substantially.

natural classes of measurements, such as Fourier measurements and random
Bernoulli measurements, do not lead to the unique reconstruction of all
possible signals, even in combination with certain practically feasible random
masks. To avoid this difficulty, the analysis is often restricted to
measurement ensembles (or masks) that satisfy a small-ball probability
condition, in order to ensure that the reconstruction is unique.
  This paper shows a complementary result: for random Bernoulli measurements,
there is still a large class of signals that can be reconstructed uniquely,
namely those signals that are ""non-peaky."" In fact, this result is much more
general: it holds for random measurements sampled from any subgaussian
distribution D, without any small-ball conditions. This is demonstrated in two
ways: first, a proof of stability and uniqueness, and second, a uniform
recovery guarantee for the PhaseLift algorithm. In all of these cases, the
number of measurements m approaches the information-theoretic lower bound.
  Finally, for random Bernoulli measurements with erasures, it is shown that
PhaseLift achieves uniform recovery of all signals (including peaky ones).

For instance, our results imply the following. Let $G$ be a quasi-random
$n$-vertex graph and suppose $H_1,\dots,H_s$ are bounded degree $n$-vertex
graphs with $\sum_{i=1}^{s} e(H_i) \leq (1-o(1)) e(G)$. Then $H_1,\dots,H_s$

$K_n$ implies an approximate version of the tree packing conjecture of
Gy\'arf\'as and Lehel for bounded degree trees, and of the Oberwolfach problem.
  We provide a more general version of the above approximate decomposition
result which can be applied to super-regular graphs and thus can be combined
with Szemer\'edi's regularity lemma. In particular our result can be viewed as
an extension of the classical blow-up lemma of Koml\'os, S\'ark\H{o}zy and

60$^\circ$ further from the disk, likely because of magnetic collimation. Its

the DW signal prediction in two regions: the genu in the corpus callosum, where
the fibres are relatively straight and parallel, and the fornix, where the

emission at longer wavelengths and low angular resolution, or from IRAC
observations of high latitude fields where zodiacal light is faint and not
strongly varying with time. The new observations analyzed here target the
COSMOS field, at low ecliptic latitude where the zodiacal light intensity
varies by factors of $\sim2$ over the range of solar elongations at which the
field can be observed. We find that the white noise component of the spatial
power spectrum of the background is correlated with the modeled zodiacal light
intensity. Roughly half of the measured white noise is correlated with the
zodiacal light, but a more detailed interpretation of the white noise is
hampered by systematic uncertainties that are evident in the zodiacal light
model. At large angular scales ($\gtrsim100""$) where excess power above the
white noise is observed, we find no correlation of the power with the modeled
intensity of the zodiacal light. This test clearly indicates that the large
scale power in the infrared background is not being caused by the zodiacal
light.

the high-energy band. We intend to constrain some of the unknown parameters of
HD 93129A through modelling the non-thermal emitter, and also to analyse the
detectability of this source in hard X-rays and $\gamma$-rays. We develop a
broadband radiative model for the wind-collision region taking into account the
evolution of the accelerated particles streaming along the shocked region, the
emission by different radiative processes, and the attenuation of the emission
propagating through the local matter and radiation fields. From the analysis of
the radio emission, we find that the binary HD~93129A is more likely to have a
low inclination and a high eccentricity. The minimum energy of the non-thermal
electrons seems to be between $\sim 20 - 100$MeV, depending on the intensity of
the magnetic field in the wind-collision region. The latter can be in the range
$\sim 20 - 1500$ mG. Our model is able to reproduce the observed radio
emission, and predicts that the non-thermal radiation from HD~93129A will
increase in the near future. With instruments such as \textit{NuSTAR},
\textit{Fermi}, and CTA, it will be possible to constrain the relativistic
particle content of the source, and other parameters such as the magnetic field
strength in the wind collision zone, which in turn can be used to obtain
upper-limits of the magnetic field on the surface of the very massive stars,
thereby inferring whether magnetic field amplification is taking place in the

concluded that the strict enforcement of the constraints on the nuclear matter
properties (NMP) defined in Ref.\ \cite{RMF-nm} will not necessary lead to the
functionals with good description of the binding energies and other ground and
excited state properties. In addition, it will not substantially reduce the
uncertainties in the predictions of the binding energies in neutron-rich
systems. It turns out that the functionals, which come close to satisfying
these NMP constraints, have some problems in the description of existing data.
On the other hand, these problems are either absent or much smaller in the
functionals which are carefully fitted to finite nuclei but which violate some
NMP constraints. This is a consequence of the fact that the properties of
finite nuclei are defined not only by nuclear matter properties but also by
underlying shell effects. The mismatch of phenomenological content, existing in
all modern functionals, related to nuclear matter physics and the physics of
finite nuclei could also be responsible.

characteristic scattering of light from a laser. It is sensitive at very low
concentrations and can accurately quantify the amount of a given molecule in a
sample. The presence of a large, nonuniform background presents a major
challenge to analysis of these spectra. To overcome this challenge, we
introduce a sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) algorithm to separate each observed
spectrum into a series of peaks plus a smoothly-varying baseline, corrupted by
additive white noise. The peaks are modelled as Lorentzian, Gaussian, or
pseudo-Voigt functions, while the baseline is estimated using a penalised cubic
spline. This latent continuous representation accounts for differences in
resolution between measurements. The posterior distribution can be
incrementally updated as more data becomes available, resulting in a scalable
algorithm that is robust to local maxima. By incorporating this representation
in a Bayesian hierarchical regression model, we can quantify the relationship
between molecular concentration and peak intensity, thereby providing an
improved estimate of the limit of detection, which is of major importance to
analytical chemistry.

seafloor can coherently scatter the energy of an oblique incident internal wave
to multiple multi-directional higher-mode waves via a series of resonant
interactions. We demonstrate that a resonance between seabed corrugations and a
normally or slightly oblique incident internal wave results in a series of
follow-up resonant interactions, which take place between the same corrugations
and successively resonated shorter waves. A chain resonance of internal waves
that carries energy to small scales is thus obtained, and we find that the
Richardson number decreases by several orders of magnitude over the corrugated
patch. If the incidence angle is large, and the incident wave perfectly
satisfies a resonance condition with the topography, it turns out that not many
higher-mode resonance or near-resonance conditions can be satisfied, such that
energy stays confined within the first few modes. Nevertheless, if the incident
waves are sufficiently detuned from satisfying a perfect resonance condition
with the seabed corrugations, then we show that this frequency detuning may
balance off the large detuning due to oblique incidence, leading to a chain
resonance that again carries energy to small scales. The evolution of the
incident and resonated wave amplitudes is predicted from the envelope equation
for internal waves over resonant seabed topography in a three-dimensional
rotating fluid, which we derive considering the Boussinesq and $f$-plane
approximations with $f$ the Coriolis frequency, linear density stratification
and small-amplitude corrugations. Our results suggest that topographic features
on the ocean floor with a dominant wavenumber vector, through the chain
resonance mechanism elucidated here, may play a more important role than
previously thought in the enhancement of diapycnal mixing and energy
dissipation.

in many contexts including the heavy censoring (as for example in cancer
survival) and the high dimensionality (as for example in micro-array data). We
implement the stability selection approach using three variable selection
techniques--Lasso, ridge regression, and elastic net applied to censored data
using AFT models. We compare the performances of these regularized techniques
with and without stability selection approaches with simulation studies and a

always stable scenario about the selection of variables and that as the

also improves compared to methods without stability selection irrespective of

parameter range for the disk magnetization, $\mu_{\rm D} = 10^{-3.5} ...
10^{-0.7}$. We disentangle the disk magnetization at the foot point of the
outflow as the main parameter that governs the properties of the outflow. We
show how the four jet integrals known from steady-state MHD are correlated to
the disk magnetization at the jet foot point. This agrees with the usual
findings of the steady-state theory, however, here we obtain these correlations
from time-dependent simulations that include the dynamical evolution of the
disk in the treatment. In particular, we obtain robust correlations between the
local disk magnetization and (i)the outflow velocity, (ii) the jet mass
loading, (iii) jet angular momentum, and (iv) the local mass accretion rate.
Essentially we find that strongly magnetized disks launch more energetic and
faster jets, and, due to a larger Alfv\'en lever arm, these jets extract more
angular momentum from the underlying disk. These kind of disk-jet systems have,
however, a smaller mass loading parameter and a lower mass
ejection-to-accretion ratio. The jets are launched at the disk surface where
the magnetization is $\mu(r,z) \simeq 0.1$. The magnetization rapidly increases
vertically providing the energy reservoir for subsequent jet acceleration. We
find indication for a critical disk magnetization $\mu_{\rm D} \simeq 0.01$
that separates the regimes of magnetocentrifugally-driven and magnetic
pressure-driven jets.

derive the exact density evolution (DE) equations for SC-TCs and analyze their
asymptotic behavior on the binary erasure channel. We also consider the
construction of families of rate-compatible SC-TC ensembles. Our numerical
results show that threshold saturation of the belief propagation (BP) decoding
threshold to the maximum a-posteriori threshold of the underlying uncoupled

SC-TCs show close-to-capacity performance as the coupling memory increases. We
further give a proof of threshold saturation for SC-TC ensembles with identical

blocks for building distributed applications. The primary motivation for
orchestrating services in the cloud used to be distributed business processes,
which drove the standardization of the Business Process Execution Language
(BPEL) and its central notion that a service is a business process. In recent
years, there has been a transition towards other motivations for orchestrating
services in the cloud, {\em e.g.}, XaaS, RMAD. Although it is theoretically
possible to make all of those services into WSDL/SOAP services, it would be too
complicated and costly for industry adoption. Therefore, the central notion
that a service is a business process is too restrictive. Instead, we view a
service as a technology neutral, loosely coupled, location transparent
procedure. With these ideas in mind, we introduce a new approach to services
orchestration: Ozy, a general orchestration container. We define this new
approach in terms of existing technology, and we show that the Ozy container
relaxes many traditional constraints and allows for simpler, more feature-rich
applications.

using the ensemble conception, we demonstrate non-locality properties for

to a scalar field has been proposed which comes from Lorentz-Chern-Simons
theory \cite{1}. That theory is a torsion free one. We extend that theory by
adding an extra term which makes torsion to be non-zero. The extended theory
can be regarded as an extension of Minimal massive gravity such that it is
non-minimally coupled to a scalar field. We obtain equations of motion of
extended theory such that they are expressed in terms of usual torsion free
spin-connection. We show that BTZ spacetime is a solution of this theory when
scalar field is constant. We define quasi-local conserved charge by the concept
of generalized off-shell ADT current which both are conserved for any
asymptotically Killing vector field as well as a Killing vector field which is
admitted by spacetime everywhere. Also we find general formula for entropy of
stationary black hole solution in the context of considered theory. We apply
the obtained formulas on BTZ black hole solution, to calculate energy, angular
momentum and entropy of this soultion. We obtain the central extension term,
the central charges and the eigenvalues of the Virasoro algebra generators for
the BTZ black hole solution. We calculate energy and angular momentum of BTZ
black hole using the eigenvalues of the Virasoro algebra generators. Also we
calculate the entropy of BTZ black hole by using the Cardy formula. We find
that obtained results using two different ways are exactly matched as we
expected.

  physical experiments for pure torsion","25 pages, 3 tables",,,,"physics.gen-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Several different versions of couple stress theory have appeared in the
literature, including the indeterminate Mindlin-Tiersten-Koiter couple stress
theory (MTK-CST), indeterminate symmetric modified couple stress theory (M-CST)
and determinate skew-symmetric consistent couple stress theory (C-CST). First,
the solutions within each of these theories for pure torsion of cylindrical
bars composed of isotropic elastic material are presented and found to provide
a remarkable basis for comparison with observed physical response. In
particular, recent novel physical experiments to characterize torsion of
micro-diameter copper wires in quasi-static tests show no significant size
effect in the elastic range. This result agrees with the prediction of the
skew-symmetric C-CST that there is no size effect for torsion of an elastic
circular bar in quasi-static loading, because the mean curvature tensor
vanishes in a pure twist deformation. On the other hand, solutions within the
other two theories exhibit size-dependent torsional response, which depends
upon either one or two additional material parameters, respectively, for the
indeterminate symmetric M-CST or indeterminate MTK-CST. Results are presented
to illustrate the magnitude of the expected size-dependence within these two
theories in torsion. Interestingly, if the material length scales for copper in
these two theories with size-dependent torsion is on the order of microns or
larger, then the recent physical experiments in torsion would align only with
the self-consistent skew-symmetric couple stress theory, which inherently shows
no size effect.

that pilots the dynamics of a particle. Such a system can be implemented by a
bouncing drop generating surface waves sustained by a parametric forcing. The
motion of the resulting ""walker"" when confined in a harmonic potential well is
generally disordered. Here we show that these trajectories correspond to
chaotic regimes characterized by intermittent transitions between a discrete
set of states. At any given time, the system is in one of these states
characterized by a double quantization of size and angular momentum. A low
dimensional intermittency determines their respective probabilities. They thus
form an eigenstate basis of decomposition for what would be observed as a
superposition of states if all measurements were intrusive.

Thus there is a need for more sophisticated techniques to meet the current
network problems. This paper focuses on Ant-net algorithm based on Ant colony
optimization which is an adaptive routing algorithm.In this approach, models of
collective intelligence are transformed into optimization techniques. The ants
travel across various paths in the network, thus depositing of pheromone,
