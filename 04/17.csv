likelihood estimate can be achieved by a simple modification of the score
equation. For a scalar parameter of interest, the estimator is equivariant
under interest respecting parameterizations and third-order median unbiased.
With a vector parameter of interest, componentwise equivariance and third-order
median centering are obtained. Like Firth's (1993, Biometrika) implicit method
for bias reduction, the new method does not require finiteness of the maximum
likelihood estimate and is effective in preventing infinite estimates.
Simulation results for continuous and discrete models, including binary and

median centering and in solving the infinite estimate problem, while keeping
comparable dispersion and the same approximate distribution as its main

with the lightest supersymmetric particle. The long-lived stau forms a bound

the internal conversion process, accelerates the destruction of ${}^{7}$Be and
${}^{7}$Li, and leads to a solution to the ${}^{7}$Li problem. On the other
hand, the bound state of the stau and ${}^{4}$He enhances productions of n, d,
t, and ${}^{6}$Li. The over-production of ${}^{6}$Li could solve the ${}^{6}$Li
problem. While, the over-productions of d and t could conflict with
observations, and the relevant parameter space of the stau is strictly
constrained. We therefore need to carefully investigate the stau-${}^{4}$He
bound state to find a condition of solving the ${}^{6}$Li problem. The scenario
of the long-lived stau simultaneously and successfully fit the abundances of
light elements (d, t, ${}^{3}$He, ${}^{4}$He, ${}^{6}$Li, and ${}^{7}$Li) and
the neutralino dark matter to the observed ones. Consequently parameter space
both of the stau and the neutralino is determined with excellent accuracy.

found to have cloudy atmospheres. Scattering of the emergent thermal radiation
from these planets by the dust grains in their atmospheres should locally give
rise to significant linear polarization of the emitted radiation. However, the
observable disk averaged polarization should be zero if the planet is
spherically symmetric. Rotation-induced oblateness may yield a net non-zero
disk averaged polarization if the planets have sufficiently high spin rotation
velocity. On the other hand, when a large natural satellite or exomoon transits
a planet with cloudy atmosphere along the line of sight, the asymmetry induced
during the transit should give rise to a net non-zero, time resolved linear
polarization signal. The peak amplitude of such time dependent polarization may
be detectable even for slowly rotating exoplanets. Therefore, we suggest that
large exomoons around directly imaged self-luminous exoplanets may be
detectable through time resolved imaging polarimetry. Adopting detailed
atmospheric models for several values of effective temperature and surface
gravity which are appropriate for self-luminous exoplanets, we present the
polarization profiles of these objects in the infrared during transit phase and
estimate the peak amplitude of polarization that occurs during the inner
contacts of the transit ingress/egress phase. The peak polarization is
predicted to range between 0.1 and 0.3 % in the infrared.

energy is injected directly to a hard site, it is trapped in this site, and
(iii) if the vibrational energy is pump in a polarizable site and two sites

multivalent effects become significant, and entropy dominates the binding free

The Sun is an active source of radio emission ranging from long
duration radio bursts associated with solar flares and coronal mass ejections
to more complex, short duration radio bursts such as solar S bursts, radio
spikes and fibre bursts. While plasma emission is thought to be the dominant
emission mechanism for most radio bursts, the electron-cyclotron maser (ECM)
mechanism may be responsible for more complex, short-duration bursts as well as
fine structures associated with long-duration bursts. Aims. We investigate the
conditions for ECM in the solar corona by considering the ratio of the electron
plasma frequency {\omega}p to the electron-cyclotron frequency {\Omega}e. The
ECM is theoretically possible when {\omega}p/{\Omega}e < 1. Methods.
Two-dimensional electron density, magnetic field, plasma frequency, and
electron cyclotron frequency maps of the off- limb corona were created using
observations from SDO/AIA and SOHO/LASCO, together with potential field
extrapolations of the magnetic field. These maps were then used to calculate
{\omega}p/{\Omega}e and Alfven velocity maps of the off-limb corona. Results.
We found that the condition for ECM emission ({\omega}p/{\Omega}e < 1) is
possible at heights < 1.07 R_sun in an active region near the limb; that is,
where magnetic field strengths are > 40 G and electron densities are greater
than 3x10^8 cm-3. In addition, we found comparatively high Alfv\'en velocities
(> 0.02 c or > 6000 km s-1) at heights < 1.07 R_sun within the active region.
Conclusions. This demonstrates that the condition for ECM emission is satisfied
within areas of the corona containing large magnetic fields, such as the core
of a large active region. Therefore, ECM could be a possible emission mechanism
for high-frequency radio and microwave bursts.

the fuzzy-GA paradigm to Smart Grids. The main aim consists in performing
decision making for power flow management tasks in the proposed microgrid model
equipped by renewable sources and an energy storage system, taking into account
the economical profit in energy trading with the main-grid. In particular, this
study focuses on the application of a Hierarchical Genetic Algorithm (HGA) for
tuning the Rule Base (RB) of a Fuzzy Inference System (FIS), trying to discover
a minimal fuzzy rules set in a Fuzzy Logic Controller (FLC) adopted to perform
decision making in the microgrid. The HGA rationale focuses on a particular
encoding scheme, based on control genes and parametric genes applied to the
optimization of the FIS parameters, allowing to perform a reduction in the
structural complexity of the RB. This approach will be referred in the
following as fuzzy-HGA. Results are compared with a simpler approach based on a
classic fuzzy-GA scheme, where both FIS parameters and rule weights are tuned,
while the number of fuzzy rules is fixed in advance. Experiments shows how the
fuzzy-HGA approach adopted for the synthesis of the proposed controller
outperforms the classic fuzzy-GA scheme, increasing the accounting profit by
67\% in the considered energy trading problem yielding at the same time a
simpler RB.

justify the relevance of TW-GUE statistics for cones, and state a conjecture

system obtained by an Euler method, it is found that with excitation only there
is a critical value of the steady state excitatory conductance for repetitive
spiking without noise and for values of the conductance near the critical value
small noise has a powerfully inhibitory effect. For a given level of inhibition
there is also a critical value of the steady state excitatory conductance for
repetitive firing and it is demonstrated that noise either in the excitatory or
inhibitory processes or both can powerfully inhibit spiking. Furthermore, near
the critical value, inverse stochastic resonance was observed when noise was
present only in the inhibitory input process.

identify several natural classes of graphs for which a finite improvement or

polynomial time. We also argue that these results are optimal in the sense that
in natural generalisations of these classes of graphs, a pure Nash equilibrium

people are reacting to each other. Many systems have explicit indicators of
replies, such as threading in discussion forums or replies and retweets in
Twitter. However, it is likely these explicit indicators capture only part of
people's reactions to each other, thus, computational social science approaches
that use them to infer relationships or influence are likely to miss the mark.
This paper explores the problem of detecting non-explicit responses, presenting
a new approach that uses tf-idf similarity between a user's own tweets and
recent tweets by people they follow. Based on a month's worth of posting data
from 449 ego networks in Twitter, this method demonstrates that it is likely
that at least 11% of reactions are not captured by the explicit reply and
retweet mechanisms. Further, these uncaptured reactions are not evenly
distributed between users: some users, who create replies and retweets without
using the official interface mechanisms, are much more responsive to followees
than they appear. This suggests that detecting non-explicit responses is an
important consideration in mitigating biases and building more accurate models
when using these markers to study social interaction and information diffusion.

least-squares regression traditionally used. In particular, by using $M$- and
$MM$-regressions we establish firmly and without doubts the linearity of the
Leavitt law in the Large Magellanic Cloud, without rejecting or excluding
Cepheid data from the analysis. This implies that light curves of Cepheids
suggesting blending, bumps, eclipses or period changes, do not affect the
Leavitt law for this galaxy. For the SMC, including this kind of Cepheids, it
is not possible to find an adequate model, probably due to the geometry of the
galaxy. In that case, a possible influence of these stars could exist.

also occur in this model for particular parameter. Our theoretical analysis and

slope of $\sim$ 0.8, followed by a steep drop at around $10^5$ s with a slope
of $\sim$ 6. After the drop, the X-ray afterglow continues with a much
shallower decay. The optical afterglow exhibits two segments of plateaus
separated by a luminous optical flare, followed by a normal decay with a slope
basically consistent with that of the late-time X-ray afterglow. The decay of
the internal X-ray plateau is much steeper than what we expect in the simplest
magnetar model. We propose a scenario in which the magnetar undergoes
gravitational-wave-driven r-mode instability, and the spin-down is dominated by
gravitational wave losses up to the end of the steep plateau, so that such a
relatively steep plateau can be interpreted as the internal emission of the
magnetar wind and the sharp drop can be produced when the magnetar collapses
into a black hole. This scenario also predicts an initial X-ray plateau lasting
for hundreds of seconds with an approximately constant flux which is compatible
with observation. Assuming that the magnetar wind has a negligible contribution
in the optical band, we interpret the optical afterglow as the forward shock
emission by invoking the energy injection from a continuously refreshed shock
following the prompt emission phase. It is shown that our model can basically
describe the temporal evolution of the multi-band afterglow of GRB 130831A.

adaptation of the breadth first search which makes it possible to grow
bi-connected subgraphs. The proposed randomized algorithm consists of growing
several subgraphs in parallel. The quality of solutions generated in this way
is further improved using a local search which exploits neighboring relations
between the subgraphs. In order to evaluate the performance of the method, an
algorithm for generating pseudo-random unit disc graphs with known optimal
solutions is created. The conducted computational experiments show that the
proposed method frequently manages to find optimal solutions and has an average

find high quality approximate solutions for graphs having up to 10.000 nodes in

eccentric orbits of Jupiter and Saturn, respectively, obtaining high-precision
gravity measurements for these planets. This data will be used to estimate the
depth of the observed surface flows on these planets. All models to date,
relating the winds to the gravity field, have been in the forward direction,
thus allowing only calculation of the gravity field from given wind models.
However, there is a need to do the inverse problem since the new observations
will be of the gravity field. Here, an inverse dynamical model, is developed to
relate the expected measurable gravity field, to perturbations of the density
and wind fields, and therefore to the observed cloud-level winds. In order to
invert the gravity field into the 3D circulation, an adjoint model is
constructed for the dynamical model, thus allowing backward integration. This
tool is used for examination of various scenarios, simulating cases in which
the depth of the wind depends on latitude. We show that it is possible to use
the gravity measurements to derive the depth of the winds, both on Jupiter and
Saturn, taking into account also measurement errors. Calculating the solution
uncertainties, we show that the wind depth can be determined more precisely in
the low-to-midlatitudes. In addition, the gravitational moments are found to be
particularly sensitive to flows at the equatorial intermediate depths,
therefore we expect that if deep winds exist on these planets they will have a
measurable signature by Juno and Cassini.

Thus, traditional embedding methods have limited potentials for many

species in the silica network and alumina phase, respectively. Al(V) is rare in
nature and was found hitherto only in the alumina phase or interfaces
containing alumina, a behavior which negatively affects the dispersion,
population, and accessibility of Al(V) species on the silica-alumina surface.
This constraint has limited the development of silica-alumina based catalysts,
particularly because Al(V) had been confirmed to act as a highly active center
for acid reactions and single-atom catalysts. Here, we report the direct
observation of high population of homogenously dispersed Al(V) species in
amorphous silica-alumina in the absence of any bulk alumina phase, by high
resolution TEM/EDX and high magnetic-field MAS NMR. Solid-state 27Al
multi-quantum MAS NMR experiments prove unambiguously that most of the Al(V)
species formed independently from the alumina phase and are accessible on the
surface for guest molecules. These species are mainly transferred to Al(VI)
species with partial formation of Al(IV) species after adsorption of water. The
NMR chemical shifts and their coordination transformation with and without
water adsorption are matching that obtained in DFT calculations of the
predicted clusters. The discovery presented in this study not only provides
fundamental knowledge of the nature of aluminum coordination, but also paves
the way for developing highly efficient catalysts.

\emph{interactions} with other objects or people. As such, given a novel image,
a vision system ought to infer which other objects/people play an important
role in a given person's activity. However, existing methods are limited to
learning action-specific interactions (e.g., how the pose of a tennis player
relates to the position of his racquet when serving the ball) for improved
recognition, making them unequipped to reason about novel interactions with
actions or objects unobserved in the training data.
  We propose to predict the ""interactee"" in novel images---that is, to localize
the \emph{object} of a person's action. Given an arbitrary image with a
detected person, the goal is to produce a saliency map indicating the most
likely positions and scales where that person's interactee would be found. To
that end, we explore ways to learn the generic, action-independent connections

retargeting, predicting object importance, and data-driven natural language
scene description. All four scenarios reveal the value in linking the subject

of shock-accelerated electrons produced by the interaction between the outflow
and the external medium. The accelerated electrons are usually assumed to
follow a power law energy distribution with an index of $p$. Observationally,
although most GRB afterglows have a $p$ larger than 2, there are still a few
GRBs suggestive of a hard ($p<2$) electron spectrum. GRB 091127, with
well-sampled broad-band afterglow data, shows evidence of a hard electron
spectrum and strong spectral evolution, with a spectral break moving from high
to lower energies. The spectral break evolves very fast and cannot be explained
by the cooling break in the standard afterglow model, unless evolving
microphysical parameters are assumed. Besides, the multi-band afterglow light
curves show an achromatic break at around 33 ks. Based on the model of a hard
electron spectrum with an injection break, we interpret the observed spectral
break as the synchrotron frequency corresponding to the injection break, and
the achromatic break as a jet break caused by the jet-edge effect. It is shown
that the spectral evolution and the multi-band afterglow light curves of GRB
091127 can be well reproduced by this model.

correspondences but this computation is rarely used in practice since there are
no simple methods to find corresponding lines. Instead, methods for finding
corresponding points are widely used. This paper proposes a similarity measure
between lines that indicates whether two lines are corresponding epipolar lines
and enables finding epipolar line correspondences as needed for the computation
of epipolar geometry.
  A similarity measure between two lines, suitable for video sequences of a
dynamic scene, has been previously described. This paper suggests a stereo
matching similarity measure suitable for images. It is based on the quality of
stereo matching between the two lines, as corresponding epipolar lines yield a
good stereo correspondence.
  Instead of an exhaustive search over all possible pairs of lines, the search
space is substantially reduced when two corresponding point pairs are given.
  We validate the proposed method using real-world images and compare it to
state-of-the-art methods. We found this method to be more accurate by a factor
of five compared to the standard method using seven corresponding points and
comparable to the 8-points algorithm.

settings, additional controls are usually available to alter the dynamics. Here
we propose to use optimal control methods for further improvement on the
precision limit of quantum parameter estimation. We show that by exploring the
additional degree of freedom offered by the controls higher precision limit can
be achieved. In particular we show that the precision limit under the

which is in contrast to the standard scheme where the precision limit is always
bounded by the coherent time.

growing attention from the research community, and is motivated by the numerous
examples of such markets on the web and in electronic commerce. Many of these
examples represent dynamic and uncertain environments, and thus, require, in
fact, online mechanisms. Unfortunately, as far as we know, no previously
published online mechanism for a multi-sided market (or even for a double-sided
market) has managed to (approximately) maximize the gain from trade, while
guaranteeing desirable economic properties such as incentivizing truthfulness,
voluntary participation and avoiding budget deficit. In this work we present
the first online mechanism for a multi-sided market which has the above
properties. Our mechanism is designed for a market setting suggested by
[Feldman and Gonen (2016)]; which is motivated by the foreseeable future form
of online advertising.
  The online nature of our setting motivated us to define a stronger notion of
individual rationality, called ""continuous individual rationality"", capturing
the natural requirement that a player should never lose either by participating
in the mechanism or by not leaving prematurely. Satisfying the requirements of
continuous individual rationality, together with the other economic properties
our mechanism guarantees, requires the mechanism to use a novel pricing scheme
where users may be paid ongoing increments during the mechanism's execution up
to a pre-known maximum value. As users rarely ever get paid in reality, this
pricing scheme is new to mechanism design. Nevertheless, the principle it is
based on can be observed in many common real life scenarios such as executive
compensation payments and company acquisition deals. We believe both our new
dynamic pricing scheme concept and our strengthened notion of individual
rationality are of independent interest.

multi-modal delta Scuti pulsator. While this does not exclude the possibility
of eclipsing systems, we argue, while spectroscopy on the systems is still
lacking, the delta Scuti model is a simpler explanation and therefore more
probable.

Frenk+1999)
revealed that there is a systematic difference between entropy profiles of
clusters of galaxies obtained by Eulerian mesh and Lagrangian smoothed particle
hydrodynamics (SPH) codes: Mesh codes gave a core with a constant entropy
whereas SPH codes did not. One possible reason for this difference is that mesh
codes are not Galilean invariant. Another possible reason is the problem of the
SPH method, which might give too much ""protection"" to cold clumps because of
the unphysical surface tension induced at contact discontinuities. In this
paper, we apply the density independent formulation of SPH (DISPH), which can
handle contact discontinuities accurately, to simulations of a cluster of
galaxies, and compare the results with those with the standard SPH. We obtained
the entropy core when we adopt DISPH. The size of the core is, however,
significantly smaller than those obtained with mesh simulations, and is
comparable to those obtained with quasi-Lagrangian schemes such as ""moving
mesh"" and ""mesh free"" schemes. We conclude that both the standard SPH without
artificial conductivity and Eulerian mesh codes have serious problems even such
an idealized simulation, while DISPH, SPH with artificial conductivity, and
quasi-Lagrangian schemes have sufficient capability to deal with it.

logarithm of frequency often declines linearly with the logarithm of size. That
power law relation forms one of the common patterns of nature. Why does the
complexity of nature reduce to such a simple pattern? Why do things as
different as tree size and enzyme rate follow similarly simple patterns? Here I
analyze such patterns by their invariant properties. For example, a common
pattern should not change when adding a constant value to all observations.
That shift is essentially the renumbering of the points on a ruler without
changing the metric information provided by the ruler. A ruler is shift
invariant only when its scale is properly calibrated to the pattern being
measured. Stretch invariance corresponds to the conservation of the total
amount of something, such as the total biomass and consequently the average
size. Rotational invariance corresponds to pattern that does not depend on the
order in which underlying processes occur, for example, a scale that additively
combines the component processes leading to observed values. I use tree size as
an example to illustrate how the key invariances shape pattern. A simple
interpretation of common pattern follows. That simple interpretation connects
the normal distribution to a wide variety of other common patterns through the
transformations of scale set by the fundamental invariances.

  performance guarantees",,,,,"cs.IT math.IT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We derive theoretical guarantees for the exact recovery of piecewise constant
two-dimensional images from a minimal number of non-uniform Fourier samples
using a convex matrix completion algorithm. We assume the discontinuities of
the image are localized to the zero level-set of a bandlimited function, which
induces certain linear dependencies in Fourier domain, such that a multifold
Toeplitz matrix built from the Fourier data is known to be low-rank. The
recovery algorithm arranges the known Fourier samples into the structured
matrix then attempts recovery of the missing Fourier data by minimizing the
nuclear norm subject to structure and data constraints. This work adapts
results by Chen and Chi on the recovery of isolated Diracs via nuclear norm
minimization of a similar multifold Hankel structure. We show that exact
recovery is possible with high probability when the bandlimited function
describing the edge set satisfies an incoherency property. Finally, we
demonstrate the algorithm on the recovery of undersampled MRI data.

is said to be bounded if it maps zero neighborhoods of $X$ into bounded sets of
$Y$. We denote $(X,Y) \in \mathcal{B}$ when every operator between $X$ and $Y$
is bounded. For a Banach space $\ell$ with a monotone norm $\|\cdot\|$ in which
the canonical system $(e_n)$ forms an unconditional basis, we consider
$\ell$-K\""othe spaces as a generalization of usual K\""othe spaces. In this
note, we characterize $\ell$-K\""othe spaces $\ell(a_{pn})$ and $\ell(b_{sm})$
such that $(\ell(a_{pn}), \ell(b_{sm})) \in \mathcal{B}$. A pair $(X,Y)$ is
said to have the bounded factorization property, and denoted $(X,Y) \in
\mathcal{BF}$, if each linear continuous operator $T : X \to X$ that factors
over $Y$ is bounded. We also prove that injective tensor products of some
classical K\""othe spaces have bounded factorization property.

  authors",,,,"math.OC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We consider an inertial primal-dual fixed point algorithm (IPDFP) to compute
the minimizations of the following Problem (1.1). This is a full splitting
approach, in the sense that the nonsmooth functions are processed individually
via their proximity operators. The convergence of the IPDFP is obtained by
reformulating the Problem (1.1) to the sum of three convex functions. This work
brings together and notably extends several classical splitting schemes, like
the primaldual method proposed by Chambolle and Pock, and the recent proximity
algorithms of Charles A. et al designed for the L1/TV image denoising model.
The iterative algorithm is used for solving nondifferentiable convex
optimization problems arising in image processing. The experimental results
indicate that the proposed IPDFP iterative algorithm performs well with respect
to state-of-the-art methods.

presence of logarithmic nonlinear electrodynamics with complete set of the
rotation parameters in arbitrary dimensions. The topology of the horizon of
these rotating black branes are flat, while, due to the presence of the dilaton
field the asymptotic behaviour of them are neither flat nor (anti)-de Sitter
[(A)dS]. We investigate the physical properties of the solutions. The mass and
angular momentum of the spacetime are obtained by using the counterterm method
inspired by AdS/CFT correspondence. We derive temperature, electric potential
and entropy associated with the horizon and check the validity of the first law
of thermodynamics on the black brane horizon. We study thermal stability of the
solutions in both canonical and grand canonical ensemble and disclose the
effects of the rotation parameter, nonlinearity of electrodynamics and dilaton
field on the thermal stability conditions. We find the solutions are thermally
stable for $\alpha<1$, while for $\alpha>1$ the solutions may encounter an
unstable phase where $\alpha$ is dilaton-electromagnetic coupling constant.
