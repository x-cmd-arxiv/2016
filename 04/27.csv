Here, we propose an idealized model, the Microscopic Congestion Model, based on

relativistic stars in a broad class of scalar-tensor theories with disformal
coupling to matter. Our approach includes theories with generalized kinetic
terms, generic scalar field potentials and contains theories with conformal
coupling as particular limits. In order to investigate how the disformal
coupling affects the structure of relativistic stars, we propose a minimal
model of a massless scalar-tensor theory and investigate in detail how the
disformal coupling affects the spontaneous scalarization of slowly rotating
neutron stars. We show that for negative values of the disformal coupling
parameter between the scalar field and matter, scalarization can be suppressed,
while for large positive values of the disformal coupling parameter stellar
models cannot be obtained. This allows us to put a mild upper bound on this
parameter. We also show that these properties can be qualitatively understood
by linearizing the scalar field equation of motion in the background of a
general-relativistic incompressible star. To address the intrinsic degeneracy
between uncertainties in the equation-of-state of neutron stars and
gravitational theory, we also show the existence of universal
equation-of-state-independent relations between the moment of inertia and
compactness of neutron stars in this theory. We show that in a certain range of
the theory's parameter space the universal relation largely deviates from that
of general relativity, allowing, in principle, to probe the existence of
spontaneous scalarization with future observations.

$\lambda$, (when $\lambda$ is big-enough) $K$ is weakly tame below $\lambda$,
and the thresholds of several existing categoricity transfers can be improved.

at the blue end of the horizontal branch or have evolved even beyond that
stage. Strikingly, the distribution in the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram of
He-rich vs. He-poor hot subdwarf stars of the globular clusters omega Cen and
NGC~2808 differ from that of their field counterparts. The metal-abundance
patterns of hot subdwarfs are typically characterized by strong deficiencies of
some lighter elements as well as large enrichments of heavy elements. A large
fraction of sdB stars are found in close binaries with white dwarf or very
low-mass main sequence companions, which must have gone through a
common-envelope phase of evolution.They provide a clean-cut laboratory to study
this important but yet purely understood phase of stellar evolution. Substellar
companions to sdB stars have also been found. For HW~Vir systems the companion
mass distribution extends from the stellar into the brown dwarf regime. A giant
planet to the pulsator V391 Peg was the first discovery of a planet that
survived the red giant evolution of its host star. Several types of pulsating
star have been discovered among hot subdwarf stars, the most common are the
gravity-mode sdB pulsators (V1093 Her) and their hotter siblings, the p-mode
pulsating V361 Hya stars. Another class of multi-periodic pulsating hot
subdwarfs has been found in the globular cluster omega Cen that is unmatched by
any field star. The masses of hot subdwarf stars are the key to understand the
stars' evolution. A few pulsating sdB stars in eclipsing binaries have been
found that allow mass determination. The results are in good agreement with
predictions from binary population synthesis. New classes of binaries, hosting
extremely low mass (ELM) white dwarfs (M<0.3 Msun), have recently been
discovered, filling a gap in the mosaic of binary stellar evolution.

between a compressively measured image and a phase-only filter. The proposed
method is based on two properties of phase-only filtering: such filtering is a
unitary circulant transform, and the correlation plane it produces is usually
sparse. Thanks to these properties, phase-only filters are perfectly compatible
with the framework of compressive sensing. Moreover, the lasso-based recovery
algorithm is very fast when phase-only filtering is used as the compression
matrix. The proposed method can be seen as a generalisation of the
correlation-based pattern recognition technique, which is hereby applied
directly to non-adaptively acquired compressed data. At the time of
measurement, any prior knowledge of the target object for which the data will
be scanned is not required. We show that images measured at extremely high
compression rates may still contain sufficient information for target
classification and localization, even if the compression rate is high enough,
that visual recognition of the target in the reconstructed image is no longer
possible. The method has been applied by us to highly undersampled measurements
obtained from a single-pixel camera, with sampling based on randomly chosen
Walsh-Hadamard patterns.

luminosities of $L_R\propto L_X^\beta$ with $\beta=1.68^{+0.10}_{-0.09}$,
linking the accretion flow (probed by X-ray luminosity) and the compact jet
(probed by radio luminosity). While such a relationship has been studied in
multiple black hole X-ray binaries (BHXBs), this work marks only the third NSXB
with such a measurement. Constraints on this relationship in NSXBs are strongly
needed, as comparing this correlation between different classes of XB systems
is key in understanding the properties that affect the jet production process
in accreting objects. Our best fit disc-jet coupling index for EXO 1745$-$248
is consistent with the measured correlation in NSXB 4U 1728$-$34 ($\beta=1.5\pm
0.2$) but inconsistent with the correlation we fit using the most recent
measurements from the literature of NSXB Aql X-1
($\beta=0.76^{+0.14}_{-0.15}$). While a similar disc-jet coupling index appears
to hold across multiple BHXBs in the hard accretion state, this does not appear
to be the case with the three NSXBs measured so far. Additionally, the
normalization of the EXO 1745$-$248 correlation is lower than the other two
NSXBs, making it one of the most radio faint XBs ever detected in the hard

These materials have layered structure and theoretical description of their
magnetic and nematic transitions has been well established in two-dimensional
approximation, i.e., when the layers can be treated independently. However, the
interaction between iron layers mediated by electron tunneling may cause
non-trivial three-dimensional behavior. Starting from the simplest model for
orbital nematic in a single layer, we investigate the influence of interlayer
tunneling on bulk nematic order and possible preemptive state where this order
is only formed near the surface.
  We found that the interlayer tunneling suppresses the bulk nematicity which
makes favorable formation of a surface nematic above the bulk transition
temperature. The purely electronic tunneling Hamiltonian, however, favors
alternating from layer-to-layer nematic order parameter in the bulk. The
uniform bulk state typically observed experimentally may be stabilized by the
coupling with the elastic lattice deformation. Depending on strength of this
coupling, we found three regimes: (i) surface nematic and alternating bulk
order, (ii) surface nematic and uniform bulk order, and (iii) uniform bulk
order without the intermediate surface phase. The intermediate surface-nematic
state may resolve the current controversy about the existence of the weak
""meta-nematic transition"" in the compound BaFe$_2$As$_{2-x}$P$_{x}$.

arbitrary point in $\Omega,$ then there exists a bundle shift of rank $1,$ say
$S,$ depending on this $w,$ such that $\mathcal K_{S^*}(w) = 4 \pi^2

disc which have been co-observed for an ancillary project of APOGEE. We have
used the Bayesian parameter estimation code PARAM to calculate distances,
extinctions, masses, and ages for these stars in a homogeneous analysis,
resulting in relative statistical uncertainties of $\sim2\%$ in distance,
$\sim4\%$ in radius, $\sim9\%$ in mass and $\sim25\%$ in age. We also assess
systematic age uncertainties due to different input physics and mass loss. We
discuss the correlation between ages and chemical abundance patterns of field
stars over a large radial range of the Milky Way's disc (5 kpc $<R_{\rm Gal}<$
14 kpc), focussing on the [$\alpha$/Fe]-[Fe/H]-age plane in five radial bins of
the Galactic disc. We find an overall agreement with the expectations of
chemical-evolution models computed before the present data were available,
especially for the outer regions. However, our data also indicate that a
significant fraction of stars now observed near and beyond the Solar
Neighbourhood migrated from inner regions. Mock CoRoGEE observations of a
chemo-dynamical Milky Way disc model show that the number of high-metallicity
stars in the outer disc is too high to be accounted for even by the strong
radial mixing present in the model. The mock observations also reveal that the
age distribution of the [$\alpha$/Fe]-enhanced sequence in the CoRoGEE
inner-disc field is much broader than expected from a combination of radial
mixing and observational errors. We suggest that a thick disc/bulge component
that formed stars for more than 3 Gyr may account for these discrepancies.

variables are a tetrad $e_a^I$ and a SO(3,1) connection ${\omega_{aI}}^J$. We
study the most general action principle compatible with diffeomorphism
invariance. This implies, in particular, considering besides the standard
Einstein-Hilbert-Palatini term, other terms that either do not change the
equations of motion, or are topological in nature. Having a well defined action
principle sometimes involves the need for additional boundary terms, whose
detailed form may depend on the particular boundary conditions at hand. In this
work, we consider spacetimes that include a boundary at infinity, satisfying
asymptotically flat boundary conditions and/or an internal boundary satisfying
isolated horizons boundary conditions. We focus on the covariant Hamiltonian
formalism where the phase space $\Gamma$ is given by solutions to the equations
of motion. For each of the possible terms contributing to the action we
consider the well posedness of the action, its finiteness, the contribution to
the symplectic structure, and the Hamiltonian and Noether charges. For the
chosen boundary conditions, standard boundary terms warrant a well posed
theory. Furthermore, the boundary and topological terms do not contribute to
the symplectic structure, nor the Hamiltonian conserved charges. The Noether
conserved charges, on the other hand, do depend on such additional terms. The
aim of this manuscript is to present a comprehensive and self-contained
treatment of the subject, so the style is somewhat pedagogical. Furthermore,
along the way we point out and clarify some issues that have not been clearly

need for different sensing probability or detection probability, same approach
of sensor placement may not be suited for all the applications. Some of the
applications are well formed and give better performance with the uniform
distribution of sensors but few need intense distribution of nodes in
particular sensitive places especially those applications meant for intrusion
detection. An application which needs high level intrusion detection and a
suitable sensor distribution methodology, known as Half-Normal Distribution

also discussed the theoretical comparison for detection probability with the

introduce the Three-Dimensional Learning Assessment Protocol (3D-LAP), which is

imbalance and ligand distortions provides a knob for tuning the sequence of
electronic levels even in intrinsically stacked oxides. We resolve in this
regard the $d$-level structure of layered Sr$_2$IrO$_4$ by electron spin
resonance. While canonical ligand-field theory predicts $g_{\parallel}$-factors
$\!<\!2$ for positive tetragonal distortions as present in Sr$_2$IrO$_4$, the
experiment indicates $g_{\parallel}\!>\!2$. This implies that the iridium $d$
levels are inverted with respect to their normal ordering. State-of-the-art
electronic-structure calculations confirm the level switching in Sr$_2$IrO$_4$,
whereas we find them in Ba$_2$IrO$_4$ to be instead normally ordered. Given the
nonpolar character of the metal-oxygen layers, our findings highlight the
tetravalent transition-metal 214 oxides as ideal platforms to explore
$d$-orbital reconstruction in the context of oxide electronics.

distances and thermal expansion rates of the bonds, we determine the conditions
under which NTE emerges. By permitting all bond lengths to expand at different
rates, we find that NTE is possible without appealing to fully rigid units.
Nearly constant, large-amplitude, isotropic NTE is observed up to the melting
temperature in a classical molecular dynamics model of a $\mathrm{ReO}_3$-like
structure when the rigidity of octahedral units is almost completely
eliminated. Only weak NTE, changing over to positive expansion is observed when
the corner-linked octahedra are rigid, with flexible second-neighbor bonds
between neighboring octahedra permitting easy rotation. We observe similar
changes to thermal expansion behavior for the diamond lattice: NTE when
second-neighbor interactions are weak to positive thermal expansion when
second-neighbor interactions are strong. From these observations, we suggest
that the only essential local conditions for NTE are atoms with low
coordination numbers along with very low energies for changing bond angles

the human pose estimation results can be improved over image based pose
estimation methods. In contrast to the commonly employed graph optimization
formulation, which is NP-hard and needs approximate solutions, we formulate
this problem into a unified two stage tree-based optimization problem for which
an efficient and exact solution exists. Although the proposed method finds an
exact solution, it does not sacrifice the ability to model the spatial and
temporal constraints between body parts in the frames; in fact it models the
{\em symmetric} parts better than the existing methods. The proposed method is
based on two main ideas: `Abstraction' and `Association' to enforce the intra-
and inter-frame body part constraints without inducing extra computational
complexity to the polynomial time solution. Using the idea of `Abstraction', a
new concept of `abstract body part' is introduced to conceptually combine the
symmetric body parts and model them in the tree based body part structure.
Using the idea of `Association', the optimal tracklets are generated for each
abstract body part, in order to enforce the spatiotemporal constraints between
body parts in adjacent frames. A sequence of the best poses is inferred from
the abstract body part tracklets through the tree-based optimization. Finally,
the poses are refined by limb alignment and refinement schemes. We evaluated
the proposed method on three publicly available video based human pose
estimation datasets, and obtained dramatically improved performance compared to
the state-of-the-art methods.

of any known comet. It has average colors of g'-r' = 0.52+/-0.04 and r'-i' =
0.04+/-0.09. We converted these to Johnson colors and found that the V-R color
is consistent with average cometary colors, but R-I is somewhat bluer; these
colors are most similar to V- and Q-type asteroids. Modeling of the optical and
IR photometry suggests it has a diameter of 150-320 m and a geometric albedo of
0.09-0.42, with diameter and albedo inversely related. Our upper limits to any
undetected coma are still consistent with a sublimation lifetime shorter than
the typical dynamical lifetimes for Jupiter Family Comets. These results
suggest that it may be of asteroidal origin and only active in the SOHO fields

traditional comets. If so, it has the smallest perihelion distance of any known

driving fluctuations in Earth's ionosphere and thermosphere. However, despite

galaxies due to the bending of light by the gravity of foreground masses. By
measuring the shapes of large numbers of galaxies (millions in recent surveys,
up to tens of billions in future surveys) we can infer the parameters that
determine cosmology. Imperfections in the detectors used to record images of
the sky can introduce changes in the apparent shape of galaxies, which in turn
can bias the inferred cosmological parameters. In this paper we consider the
effect of two widely discussed sensor imperfections: tree-rings, due to
impurity gradients which cause transverse electric fields in the Charge-Coupled
Devices (CCD), and pixel-size variation, due to periodic CCD fabrication
errors. These imperfections can be observed when the detectors are subject to
uniform illumination (flat field images). We develop methods to determine the
spurious shear and convergence (due to the imperfections) from the flat-field
images. We calculate how the spurious shear when added to the lensing shear
will bias the determination of cosmological parameters. We apply our methods to
candidate sensors of the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST) as a timely and
important example, analyzing flat field images recorded with LSST prototype
CCDs in the laboratory. We find that tree-rings and periodic pixel-size
variation present in the LSST CCDs will introduce negligible bias to
cosmological parameters determined from the lensing power spectrum,

  [Purpose] To assess the impact that a second electroweak measurement of the
weak-charge form factor of 208Pb may have on the determination of its overall
weak-charge density.
  [Methods] Using the two putative experimental values of the form factor,
together with a simple implementation of Bayes' theorem, we calibrate a
theoretically sound - yet surprisingly little known - symmetrized Fermi
function, that is characterized by a density and form factor that are both
known exactly in closed form.
  [Results] Using the charge form factor of 208Pb as a proxy for its
weak-charge form factor, we demonstrate that using only two experimental points
to calibrate the symmetrized Fermi function is sufficient to accurately
reproduce the experimental charge form factor over a significant range of

with multiple modes of behavior. Indirect encodings can potentially answer this
challenge. Yet in practice, indirect encodings do not yield effective
multimodal controllers. Thus, this paper introduces novel multimodal extensions
to HyperNEAT, a popular indirect encoding. A previous multimodal HyperNEAT
approach called situational policy geometry assumes that multiple brains
benefit from being embedded within an explicit geometric space. However,
experiments here illustrate that this assumption unnecessarily constrains
evolution, resulting in lower performance. Specifically, this paper introduces
HyperNEAT extensions for evolving many brains without assuming geometric
relationships between them. The resulting Multi-Brain HyperNEAT can exploit
human-specified task divisions to decide when each brain controls the agent, or
can automatically discover when brains should be used, by means of preference
neurons. A further extension called module mutation allows evolution to
discover the number of brains, enabling multimodal behavior with even less
expert knowledge. Experiments in several multimodal domains highlight that
multi-brain approaches are more effective than HyperNEAT without multimodal
extensions, and show that brains without a geometric relation to each other
outperform situational policy geometry. The conclusion is that Multi-Brain
HyperNEAT provides several promising techniques for evolving complex multimodal
behavior.

$\Delta$ is smaller than the BCS gap, a population imbalance appears, and the
superconductor-normal metal phase transition is of the first order. The
quasiparticle imbalance is an equilibrium property that appears due to the
asymmetry with respect to $\mu_R$ of the single-particle energy interval in

  For $\mu_R - \mu$ taking values in some ranges, the equation for $\Delta$ may
have more than one solution at the same temperature, forming branches of

with the highest energy gap, which corresponds to the BCS solution when $\mu =

spectrum of physical excitations for the bilocal field.
  The emergent conformal symmetry is a reparametrization symmetry, which is
spontaneously broken to $SL(2,R)$, leading to zero modes. These zero modes are
lifted by a small residual explicit breaking, which produces an enhanced
contribution to the four point function. This contribution displays a maximal
Lyapunov exponent in the chaos region (out of time ordered correlator). We
expect these features to be universal properties of large $N$ quantum mechanics

spatially resolved by our observations, of which ten have virial mass estimates
that agree to within a factor of two with mass estimates derived directly from
CO integrated intensity, suggesting that the majority of these GMCs are bound.
The resolved clouds show consistency with Larson's fundamental relations

linewidth scales with the size as DeltaV ~ R^(0.52+/-0.20), and the median
surface density in the subsample is 54 Msun/pc^(-2). We detect 13CO in four

goal, we experiment with three different prescriptions for galactic inflows and
outflows and use OMEGA within a Markov Chain Monte Carlo code to recover the
set of input parameters that best reproduces the chemical evolution of nine
elements in the dwarf spheroidal galaxy Sculptor. This provides a consistent
framework for comparing the best-fit solutions generated by our different

that all three prescriptions can reproduce in an almost identical way the

same capacity to fit the data, the best values recovered for the parameters
controlling the number of Type Ia supernovae and the strength of galactic
outflows, are substantially different and in fact mutually exclusive from one
model to another. For the purpose of understanding how a galaxy evolves, we
conclude that only reproducing the evolution of a limited number of elements is
insufficient and can lead to misleading conclusions. More elements or
additional constraints such as the galaxy's star formation efficiency and the
gas fraction are needed in order to break the degeneracy between the different
modeling assumptions. Our results show that the successes and failures of
chemical evolution models are predominantly driven by the input stellar yields,
rather than by the complexity of the galaxy model itself. Simple models such as

only way to identify this population since only two sources show Compton-thick
levels of excess in the OIII to X-ray emission ratio (F_OIII/F_2-10 keV>1) and
WISE colors do not identify most of them as AGN. Based on this small sample, we
find that a higher fraction of these AGN are in the final merger stage than
typical BAT AGN. Additionally, these nine obscured AGN have, on average, four
times higher accretion rates than other BAT-detected AGN (Edd ratio=0.068

implies a higher fraction of nearby AGN may be Compton-thick (~22%) and the sum
of black hole growth in Compton-thick AGN (Eddington ratio times population
percentage), is nearly as large as mildly obscured and unobscured AGN.

based on stacked, high signal to noise ratio (SNR), Sloan Digital Sky Survey

age, metallicity and star formation history. We find that the stellar
metallicities are slightly supersolar (Z ~ 0.027 +/- 0.002) and do not depend
on redshift. Dust extinction is very low, with a mean of Av ~ 0.08 +/- 0.03
mag. The ETGs show an anti-hierarchical evolution (downsizing) where more
massive galaxies are older. The SFHs can be approximated by a parametric
function of the form SFR(t) \propto \tau^-(c+1) t^(c) exp(-t/\tau), with
typical short e-folding times of \tau ~ 0.6 - 0.8 Gyr (and a dispersion of +/-
0.1 Gyr) and c ~ 0.1 (and a dispersion of +/- 0.05). The inferred SFHs are also
used to place constraints on the properties and evolution of the ETG
progenitors. In particular, the ETGs of our samples should have formed most
stars through a phase of vigorous star formation (SFRs > 350-400 Msun yr^-1) at
z ~ 4 - 5, and are quiescent by z ~ 1.5 -2. Our results represent an attempt to
demonstrate quantitatively the evolutionary link between the most massive ETGs
at z < 0.3 and the properties of suitable progenitors at high redshifts, also
showing that the full-spectrum fitting is a powerful approach to reconstruct

higher fraction of passive and HI-poor galaxies, while low-mass groups host
younger (often interacting) galaxies. For cluster galaxies not associated with
groups we corroborate our previous finding that HI gas (if any) is
significantly stripped via ram-pressure during their first passage through the
intra-cluster medium, and find mild evidence for a starburst associated with
this event. In addition, we find an overabundance of morphologically peculiar

efficiently probe the cosmic reionization and the large-scale structure.
Without detecting individual sources, line intensity mapping makes use of all
available photons and measures the integrated light in the source confusion
limit, to efficiently map the three-dimensional matter distribution on large
scales as traced by a given emission line. One particular challenge is the
separation of desired signals from astrophysical continuum foregrounds and line
interlopers. Here we present a technique to extract large-scale structure
information traced by emission lines from different redshifts, embedded in a
three-dimensional intensity mapping data cube. The line redshifts are
distinguished by the anisotropic shape of the power spectra when projected onto
a common coordinate frame. We consider the case where high-redshift [CII] lines
are confused with multiple low-redshift CO rotational lines. We present a
semi-analytic model for [CII] and CO line estimates based on the cosmic
infrared background measurements, and show that with a modest instrumental
noise level and survey geometry, the large-scale [CII] and CO power spectrum
amplitudes can be successfully extracted from a confusion-limited data set,
without external information. We discuss the implications and limits of this
technique for possible line intensity mapping experiments.

estimator flexion are both subject to the mass sheet degeneracy. Mass sheet
degeneracy refers to a transformation that leaves the reduced shear and flexion
invariant. In general, this transformation can be approximated by the addition
of a constant surface mass density sheet. We propose a new technique to break
the mass sheet degeneracy. The method uses mass moments of the shear or flexion
fields in combination with convergence information derived from number counts
which exploit the magnification bias. The difference between the measured mass
moments provides an estimator for the magnitude of the additive constant that
is the mass-sheet. For demonstrating this, we derive relations that hold true
in general for n-th order moments and show how they can be employed effectively
to break the degeneracy. We investigate the detectability of this degeneracy
parameter from our method and find that the degeneracy parameter can be
feasibly determined from stacked galaxy-galaxy lensing data and cluster lensing
data. Furthermore, we compare the signal-to-noise ratios of convergence
information from number counts with shear and flexion for SIS and NFW models.
We find that the combination of shear and flexion performs best on galaxy and
cluster scales and the convergence information can therefore be used to break
the mass sheet degeneracy without quality loss in the mass reconstruction. In
summary, there is power in the combination of shear, flexion, convergence and
their higher order moments. With the anticipated wealth of lensing data from
upcoming and future satellite missions - EUCLID and WFIRST - this technique
will be feasible.

state excess, where the masses of all associated particles are linked with a
new symmetry breaking scale. In this model, the diphoton final states arise due
to loops involving three pairs of new vector-like particles having the same
quantum numbers as down-type quarks and lepton doublets. These new vector-like
fermions are embedded alongside the SM fermions into minimal anomaly-free
representations of the $SU(6)$ gauge symmetry. The $SU(6)$ symmetry is broken
to the Standard Model times $U(1)_X$ at the GUT scale, and masses for the
vector-like fermions arise at the TeV scale only after the residual $U(1)_X$
symmetry is broken. The vector-like fermions do not acquire masses via breaking
of the SM symmetry at the EW scale. The field which is responsible for the
newly observed resonance belongs to the $\bar{6}_H$ representation. The dark
matter arises from the SM singlet fermion residing in $\bar{6}$ and is of
Majorana type. We explicitly demonstrate gauge coupling unification in this

ingredients. The simulations probe overdense, average, and underdense regions
of the universe of several hundred comoving Mpc$^3$, each yielding a sample of
over 3,000 halos in the mass range $10^7 - 10^{9.5}~\Ms$ at their final
redshifts of 15, 12.5, and 8, respectively. In the process, we simulate the
effects of radiative and supernova feedback from 5,000 to 10,000 metal-free
(Population III) stars in each simulation. We find that halos as small as
$10^7~\Ms$ are able to form stars due to metal-line cooling from earlier
enrichment by massive Population III stars. However, we find such halos do not
form stars continuously. Using our large sample, we find that the galaxy-halo

performance, we take them as design parameters and show that by introducing
such a pair of parameters per distance constraint, distributed controller
achieving simultaneously both formation and motion control can be designed that
not only encompasses the popular gradient control, but more importantly allows
us to achieve constant collective translation, rotation or their combination

observed in high-temperature superconducting cuprates and are now the most
investigated among the competing orders in the still hot debate on these
systems. A wealth of new experimental data raise several fundamental issues
that challenge the various theoretical proposals. Here, we account for the
complex experimental temperature vs. doping phase diagram and we provide a
coherent scenario explaining why different CDW onset curves are observed by
different experimental probes and seem to extrapolate at zero temperature into
seemingly different quantum critical points (QCPs) in the intermediate and
overdoped region. We also account for the pseudogap and its onset temperature
T*(p) on the basis of dynamically fluctuating CDWs. The nearly singular
anisotropic scattering mediated by these fluctuations also account for the
rapid changes of the Hall number seen in experiments and provides the first
necessary step for a possible Fermi surface reconstruction fully establishing
at lower doping. Finally we show that phase fluctuations of the CDWs, which are
enhanced in the presence of strong correlations near the Mott insulating phase,
naturally account for the disappearance of the CDWs at low doping with yet
another QCP.

onto the electrode surface by electropolymerization in the presence of a
functional doping ion, EBB. The Ppy/EBB-coated electrode was templated by PQ
ion and then the performance of the molecularly imprinted EBB/Ppy/GPE was
evaluated by voltammetric technique. The prepared electrode exhibited
considerable increase in electroactivity of the sensor toward this herbicide
compared to the non-imprinted electrode. To enhance the detection capability of
the prepared system, the factors controlling its response were investigated and
optimized using differential pulse voltammetry. The proposed analytical
procedure was proved to be applicable in the concentration range of 5 to 50

Ultimately, the proposed analytical methodology was applied to ascertain
possible interferences and investigate real samples of dam water. Recovery

continuous-variable systems. Our emphasis is on a class of channels that we
call photon-added Gaussian channels, which are experimentally viable with
current quantum-optical technologies. A strong motivation for considering these
channels is the fact that it is compulsory to go beyond the Gaussian domain for
numerous tasks in continuous-variable quantum information processing such as
entanglement distillation from Gaussian states and universal quantum
computation. The single-mode photon-added channels we consider are obtained by
using two-mode beam splitters and squeezing operators with photon addition
applied to the ancilla ports giving rise to families of non-Gaussian channels.
For each such channel, we derive its operator-sum representation, indispensable
in the present context. We observe that these channels are Fock preserving
(coherence nongenerating). We then report two examples of activation using our
scheme of photon addition, that of quantum-optical nonclassicality at outputs
of channels that would otherwise output only classical states and of both the
quantum and private communication capacities, hinting at far-reaching
applications for quantum-optical communication. Further, we see that noisy
Gaussian channels can be expressed as a convex mixture of these non-Gaussian
channels. We also present other physical and information-theoretic properties
of these channels.

studying differential topology.
  Many revered texts, such as Spivak's ""Calculus on Manifolds"" and Guillemin
and Pollack's ""Differential Topology"" introduce forms by first working through
properties of alternating tensors. Unfortunately, many students get bogged down
with the whole notion of tensors and never get to the punch lines: Stokes'
Theorem, de Rham cohomology, Poincare duality, and the realization of various
topological invariants (e.g. the degree of a map) via forms, none of which
actually require tensors to make sense!
  In these notes, we'll follow a different approach, following the philosophy
of Amy's Ice Cream: Life is uncertain. Eat dessert first.
  We're first going to define forms on $\mathbb{R}^n$ via unmotivated formulas,
develop some proficiency with calculation, show that forms behave nicely under
changes of coordinates, and prove Stokes' Theorem. This approach has the
disadvantage that it doesn't develop deep intuition, but the strong advantage
that the key properties of forms emerge quickly and cleanly. Only then, in
Chapter 3, will we go back and show that tensors with certain (anti)symmetry
properties have the exact same properties as the formal objects that we studied
in Chapters 1 and 2. This allows us to re-interpret all of our old results from
a more modern perspective, and move onwards to using forms to do topology.

precisely the primary ideals of L. It is shown that an ideal I of L is a
product of finitely many prime ideals if and only the graded part gr(I) of I is
a product of prime ideals and I/gr(I) is finitely generated with a generating

excited states subspace is shielded from long range hopping, namely it occurs
as if long range hopping would be absent. This is a cooperative phenomenon
since shielding is effective over a time scale which diverges with the system
size. We named this effect {\it Cooperative Shielding}. We also discuss the
consequences of our findings on Anderson localization. Long range hopping is
usually thought to destroy localization due to the fact that it induces an
infinite number of resonances. Contrary to this common lore we show that the
excited states display strong localized features when shielding is effective
even in the regime of strong long range coupling. A brief discussion on the
extension of our results to generic power-law decaying long range hopping is
also given. Our preliminary results confirms that the effects found for the

commonly believed that they are, Gauthier et al.(2014) recently showed that
these abilities become more correlated as experience with nonface categories
increases. They argued that there is a single underlying visual ability, v,
that is expressed in performance with both face and nonface categories as
experience grows. Using the Cambridge Face Memory Test and the Vanderbilt
Expertise Test, they showed that the shared variance between Cambridge Face
Memory Test and Vanderbilt Expertise Test performance increases monotonically
as experience increases. Here, we address why a shared resource across
different visual domains does not lead to competition and to an inverse
correlation in abilities? We explain this conundrum using our
neurocomputational model of face and object processing (The Model, TM). Our
results show that, as in the behavioral data, the correlation between
subordinate level face and object recognition accuracy increases as experience
grows. We suggest that different domains do not compete for resources because
the relevant features are shared between faces and objects. The essential power
of experience is to generate a ""spreading transform"" for faces that generalizes
to objects that must be individuated. Interestingly, when the task of the
network is basic level categorization, no increase in the correlation between
domains is observed. Hence, our model predicts that it is the type of
experience that matters and that the source of the correlation is in the
fusiform face area, rather than in cortical areas that subserve basic level
categorization. This result is consistent with our previous modeling
elucidating why the FFA is recruited for novel domains of expertise (Tong et
al., 2008).

example, that the time distribution of ~25 MeV proton events varies from cycle
to cycle. In particular, the time evolution of the SEP occurrence rate in Cycle
24 is strongly asymmetric between the northern and southern solar hemispheres,
and tracks the sunspot number in each hemisphere, whereas Cycle 23 was more
symmetric. There was also an absence of 25 MeV proton events during the solar
minimum preceding Cycle 24 (other minima show occasional, often reasonably
intense events). So far, events comparable to the exceptionally intense events

presented and reviewed. The fundamental differences between these
interpretations are made transparent by explicitly showing what information is
carried locally by each physical system in an idealized experimental test of
Bell's theorem. This also shows how each of these models can be locally causal
and deterministic. First, a model is presented which avoids Bell's arguments
through the assumption that space-time inflated from an initial singularity,
which encapsulates the entire past light cone of every event in the universe.
From this assumption, it is shown how quantum mechanics can produce locally
consistent reality by choosing one of many possible futures at the time of the
singularity. Secondly, we review and expand the Parallel Lives interpretation
of Brassard and Raymond-Robichaud, which maintains local causality and
determinism by abandoning the strictest notion of realism. Finally, the two
ideas are combined, resulting in a parallel lives model in which lives branch
apart earlier, under the assumption of a single unified interaction history.
The physical content of weak values within each model is discussed, along with
related philosophical issues concerning free will.

reveals that phenomena that require more factors will be less prevalent, scale
more superlinearly and show larger variance across cities of similar size. The

pseudo-segments. This extends a similar (and slightly better) bound for
pseudo-circles due to Marcus and Tardos. Our result is based on a technique of
Ellenberg, Solymosi and Zahl that transforms arrangements of plane curves into
arrangements of space curves, so that lenses (pairs of subarcs of the curves
that intersect at least twice) become vertical depth cycles. We then apply a
variant of a technique of Aronov and Sharir to eliminate these depth cycles by
making a small number of cuts, which corresponds to a small number of cuts to
the original planar arrangement of curves. After these cuts have been
performed, the resulting curves form a collection of pseudo-segments.
  Our cutting bound leads to new incidence bounds between points and
constant-degree algebraic curves. The conditions for these incidence bounds are
slightly stricter than those for the current best-known bound of Pach and
Sharir; for our result to hold, the curves must be algebraic and of bounded
maximum degree, while Pach and Sharir's bound only imposes weaker, purely
topological constraints on the curves. However, when our conditions hold, the
new bounds are superior for almost all ranges of parameters. We also obtain new
bounds on the complexity of a single level in an arrangement of constant-degree
algebraic curves, and a new bound on the complexity of many marked faces in an

compactness. Having $r_f$ reached $R_\star,$ then the total injected dark
energy via $V_\phi $ turns NSs into invisible DEOs. While this may provide an
explanation for the absence of stellar BHs with $M_{BH}\leq 5 \MSun$ and NSs
with $M_{NS}\geq 2 \MSun$, it also suggests that DEOs might have hidden
connection to dark matter and dark energy in cosmology.

microsphere probes of 2-10 microns, to induce oscillatory strains and measure
mucus stress response. We show that viscoelastic properties are highly
dependent on the strain scale (l) with three distinct regimes emerging:
microscale: l_1<4 microns, mesoscale: l_2~4-10 microns, and macroscale: l_3>10
microns. While mucus response is similar to water for l_1 indicating that
probes rarely contact the mucus mesh, for l_2 the response is distinctly more
viscous and independent of probe size, demonstrating that the mucus behaves as
a continuum. However, this principally viscous mesoscale response is distinct
from the largely elastic macroscopic mucus response. Only for l_3 does the
response mimic macroscopic elasticity, with rigid constraints strongly
resisting microsphere displacement. Our results demonstrate that a uniform mesh
model for mucus with a single lengthscale modulating the crossover from
water-like to elastic is too simplistic. Rather, the mucus responds as a
hierarchical network with a loose microscopic mesh controlling mechanics for
l_2, coupled with a mesoscale rigid scaffold responsible for the macroscopic

accomplish task-assign process in a limited time interval while operating in an
uncertain undersea environment, where spatio-temporal variability of the
operating field is taken into account. To this end, a high level reactive
mission planner and a low level motion planning system are constructed. The
high level system is responsible for task priority assignment and guiding the
vehicle toward a target of interest considering on-time termination of the
mission. The lower layer is in charge of generating optimal trajectories based
on sequence of tasks and dynamicity of operating terrain. The mission planner
is able to reactively re-arrange the tasks based on mission/terrain updates
while the low level planner is capable of coping unexpected changes of the
terrain by correcting the old path and re-generating a new trajectory. As a
result, the vehicle is able to undertake the maximum number of tasks with
certain degree of maneuverability having situational awareness of the operating

biogeography based optimization (BBO) algorithm that is capable of providing
efficient solutions. To evaluate the performance of the proposed framework,
firstly, a realistic model of undersea environment is provided based on
realistic map data, and then several scenarios, treated as real experiments,
are designed through the simulation study. Additionally, to show the robustness

  dispersion in early-type galaxies, and slope of the density profiles","MNRAS, accepted",,"10.1093/mnras/stw1010",,"astro-ph.GA","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We report a tight linear relation between the HI circular velocity measured
at 6 $R_{\rm e}$ and the stellar velocity dispersion measured within 1 $R_{\rm
e}$ for a sample of 16 early-type galaxies with stellar mass between $10^{10}$
and $10^{11}$ $\mathrm{M}_\odot$. The key difference from previous studies is
that we only use spatially resolved $v_\mathrm{circ}$(HI) measurements obtained
at large radius for a sizeable sample of objects. We can therefore link a
kinematical tracer of the gravitational potential in the dark-matter dominated
outer regions of galaxies with one in the inner regions, where baryons control
the distribution of mass. We find that $v_\mathrm{circ}$(HI) = 1.33
$\sigma_\mathrm{e}$ with an observed scatter of just 12 percent. This indicates
a strong coupling between luminous and dark matter from the inner- to the outer
regions of early-type galaxies, analogous to the situation in spirals and dwarf
irregulars. The $v_\mathrm{circ}$(HI)-$\sigma_\mathrm{e}$ relation is shallower
than those based on $v_\mathrm{circ}$ measurements obtained from stellar
kinematics and modelling at smaller radius, implying that \vcirc\ declines with
radius -- as in bulge-dominated spirals. Indeed, the value of
$v_\mathrm{circ}$(HI) is typically 25 percent lower than the maximum
$v_\mathrm{circ}$ derived at $\sim0.2\ R_\mathrm{e}$ from dynamical models.
Under the assumption of power-law total density profiles $\rho \propto
r^{-\gamma}$, our data imply an average logarithmic slope
$\langle\gamma\rangle=2.18\pm0.03$ across the sample, with a scatter of 0.11
around this value. The average slope and scatter agree with recent results
obtained from stellar kinematics alone for a different sample of early-type
galaxies.

independent measurements of $H(z)$ from BAO data with the value of the Hubble
constant $H_0$, and used the second of these diagnostics to test the
$\Lambda$CDM model. Their result indicated a considerable tension between
observations and predictions of the $\Lambda$CDM model. Since reliable data
concerning expansion rates of the Universe at different redshifts $H(z)$ are
crucial for the successful application of this method, we investigate both
two-point diagnostics on the most comprehensive set of $N=36$ measurements of
$H(z)$ coming from the BAO and differential ages (DA) of passively evolving
galaxies. We discuss the uncertainties of two-point diagnostics and find that
they are strongly non-Gaussian and follow the patterns deeply rooted in their
very construction. Therefore we propose that non-parametric median statistics
is the most appropriate way of treating this problem. Our results support the
claims that $\Lambda$CDM is in tension with $H(z)$ data according to the
two-point diagnostics developed by Shafieloo, Sahni and Starobinsky. However,
other alternatives to the $\Lambda$CDM, such as wCDM or CPL models perform even
worse. We also notice that there are serious systematic differences between BAO
and DA methods which ought to be better understood before $H(z)$ measurements
can become competitive to the other probes.

accompanied by reflection components from distant cold matter, and/or
optically-thin thermal emission from the host galaxy. In all objects,
relativistic reflection components from the innermost disk are not required.
Eight objects show a significant narrow iron-K$\alpha$ emission line. Comparing
their observed equivalent widths with the predictions from the Monte-Carlo
based torus model by \cite{Ike09}, we constrain the column density in the
equatorial plane to be $\log N^{\rm eq}_{\rm H} > 22.7$ or the torus half
opening angle $\theta_{\rm oa} < 70^\circ$. We infer that the Eddington ratio

LLAGNs: the torus becomes large at $\lambda_{\rm Edd} \gtrsim 2\times10^{-4}$,
whereas at lower accretion rates it is little developed. The luminosity
correlation between the hard X-ray and mid-infrared (MIR) bands of the LLAGNs
follows the same one as for more luminous AGNs. This implies that other
mechanisms than AGN-heated dust are responsible for the MIR emission in low

the propagation of regularities of density patch for viscous inhomogeneous
flow, we first establish the global in time well-posedness of two-dimensional
inhomogeneous incompressible Navier-Stokes system with initial density being of
the form: $\eta_1{\bf 1}_{\Om_0}+\eta_2{\bf 1}_{\Om_0^c},$ for any pair of
positive constants $(\eta_1,\eta_2),$ and for any bounded, simply connected
$W^{k+2,p}(\R^2)$ domain $\Om_0.$ We then prove that the time evolved domain
$\Om(t)$ also belongs to the class of $W^{k+2,p}$ for any $t>0.$ Thus in some
sense, we have solved the aforementioned Lions' question %of density patch in
\cite{Lions96} in the two-dimensional case. Compared with our previous paper
\cite{LZ}, here we remove the smallness condition on the jump,
$|\eta_1-\eta_2|,$ moreover, the techniques used in the present paper are
completely different from those in \cite{LZ}.

top of a convex spherical substrate are studied. The morphology of the droplet
is determined from the global minimum of the Helmholtz free energy. The contact
angle between the droplet and the spherical substrate is expressed by the
generalized Young's formula. When the line tension is positive and large, the
contact angle jumps discontinuously to $180^{\circ}$, the circular contact line
shrinks towards the top of the substrate, and the droplet detaches from the
substrate, forming a spherical droplet if the substrate is hydrophobic (i.e.,
the Young's contact angle is large). This finding is consistent with that
predicted by Widom [J. Phys. Chem. {\bf 99}, 2803 (1995)]; the line tension
induces a drying transition on a flat substrate. On the other hand, the contact
angle jumps to $0^{\circ}$, the circular contact line shrinks towards the
bottom of the substrate, and the droplet spreads over the substrate to form a
wrapped spherical droplet if the substrate is hydrophilic (i.e., the Young's
contact angle is small). Therefore, not only the drying transition of a
cap-shaped to a detached spherical droplet but also the wetting transition of a
cap-shaped to a wrapped spherical droplet could occur on a spherical substrate
as the surface area of the substrate is finite. When the line tension is
negative and its magnitude increases, the contact line asymptotically
approaches the equator from either above or below. The droplet with a contact
line that coincides with the equator is an isolated, singular solution of the
first variational problem. In this instance, the contact line is pinned and
cannot move as far as the line tension is smaller than the critical magnitude,
where the wetting transition occurs.

can give rise to chimera; this find further relaxes the essential connectivity
requirement of getting a chimera state. We choose a network of identical

emission shows Doppler-shifted velocity features with velocity ranges similar
to those of the previously reported 22 GHz H2O masers, however the
non-contemporaneous observations also show differences in velocity offsets. The
sub-parsec-scale distribution of the 22 GHz H2O masers revealed by earlier VLBI
(Very Long Baseline Interferometry) observations suggests that the
submillimeter masers could arise in an edge-on rotating disk. The maser
features remain unresolved by the synthesized beam of ~ 0.54 (~30 pc) and are
located toward the 321 GHz continuum peak within errors. A marginally detected
(3 sigma) high-velocity feature is redshifted by 579 km/s with respect to the
systemic velocity of the galaxy. Assuming that this feature is real and arises
from a Keplerian rotating disk in this galaxy, it is located at a radius of
~0.020 pc (~1.5 x 10^5 Schwarzschild radii), which would enable molecular
material closer to the central engine to be probed than the 22 GHz H2O masers.
This detection confirms that submillimeter H2O masers are a potential tracer of
the circumnuclear regions of active galaxies, which will benefit from higher
angular resolution studies with ALMA.

particles carrying both color and/or electric charges to mediate loop-induced
couplings of the resonance to two gluons and two photons. The new colored
particles may not be stable and could decay into final states containing
standard model particles. We consider an electroweak doublet of vector-like
quarks (VLQs) carrying electric charges of 5/3 and 2/3, respectively, which
mediate the loop-induced couplings of the 750 GeV resonance. If the VLQ has a
mass at around 1 TeV, it naturally gives rise to the observed diphoton signal
strength while all couplings remain perturbative up to a high scale. At the
same time, if the charge-5/3 VLQ decays into final states containing top quark
and W boson, it would contribute to the multilepton excesses observed in both
Run 1 and Run 2 data. It is also possible to incorporate a dark matter
candidate in the decay final states to explain the observed relic density.

novel dense descriptor, called dense adaptive self-correlation (DASC), to

observation that self-similarity existing within images is robust to imaging
modality variations, we define the descriptor with a series of an adaptive
self-correlation similarity measure between patches sampled by a randomized

discriminative learning. The computational redundancy of dense descriptors is
dramatically reduced by applying fast edge-aware filtering. Furthermore, in
order to address geometric variations including scale and rotation, we propose
a geometry-invariant DASC (GI-DASC) descriptor that effectively leverages the
DASC through a superpixel-based representation. For a quantitative evaluation
of the GI-DASC, we build a novel multi-modal benchmark as varying photometric

performance of the DASC and GI-DASC in many cases of multi-modal and

important to employ appropriate image priors for regularization. One recent
popular prior---the graph Laplacian regularizer---assumes that the target pixel
patch is smooth with respect to an appropriately chosen graph. However, the
mechanisms and implications of imposing the graph Laplacian regularizer on the
original inverse problem are not well understood. To address this problem, in
this paper we interpret neighborhood graphs of pixel patches as discrete
counterparts of Riemannian manifolds and perform analysis in the continuous
domain, providing insights into several fundamental aspects of graph Laplacian
regularization for image denoising. Specifically, we first show the convergence
of the graph Laplacian regularizer to a continuous-domain functional,
integrating a norm measured in a locally adaptive metric space. Focusing on
image denoising, we derive an optimal metric space assuming non-local
self-similarity of pixel patches, leading to an optimal graph Laplacian
regularizer for denoising in the discrete domain. We then interpret graph
Laplacian regularization as an anisotropic diffusion scheme to explain its
behavior during iterations, e.g., its tendency to promote piecewise smooth
signals under certain settings. To verify our analysis, an iterative image
denoising algorithm is developed. Experimental results show that our algorithm
performs competitively with state-of-the-art denoising methods such as BM3D for
natural images, and outperforms them significantly for piecewise smooth images.

proposed, using approximate Bayesian computation (ABC). ABC avoids evaluation
of an intractable likelihood by matching summary statistics for the observed

on parameter draws from the prior. Draws that produce a 'match' between
observed and simulated summaries are retained, and used to estimate the
inaccessible posterior. With no reduction to a low-dimensional set of
sufficient statistics being possible in the state space setting, we define the
summaries as the maximum of an auxiliary likelihood function, and thereby
exploit the asymptotic sufficiency of this estimator for the auxiliary
parameter vector. We derive conditions under which this approach - including a
computationally efficient version based on the auxiliary score - achieves
Bayesian consistency. To reduce the well-documented inaccuracy of ABC in
multi-parameter settings, we propose the separate treatment of each parameter
dimension using an integrated likelihood technique. Three stochastic volatility

The frequency dispersion of collective spin wave excitations in the above

technique while sweeping the wave vector perpendicularly to the wire length
over three Brillouin zones of the reciprocal space. For the rectangular NWs,
the lowest frequency fundamental mode, characterized by a quasi- uniform
profile of the amplitude of the dynamic magnetization across the NW width,
exhibits a sizeable and periodic frequency dispersion. A similar dispersive
mode is also present in L-shaped NWs, but the mode amplitude is concentrated in
the thin side of the NWs. The width and the center frequency of the magnonic
band associated with the above fundamental modes has been analyzed, showing
that both can be tuned by varying the external applied field. Moreover, for the
L-shaped NWs it is shown that there is also a second dispersive mode,at higher

to form an ordered crystal, stabilized by a long ranged repulsion, the details
of this repulsion remain something of a mystery, but all experiments performed
to date have confirmed a dipolar-repulsion, at least at dilute concentrations.
More complex arrangements are often observed, especially at higher
concentration, and these seem to be incompatible with a purely repulsive
potential. In addition to electrostatic repulsion, interfacial particles may
also interact via deformation of the surface: so-called capillary effects.
Pair-wise capillary interactions are well understood, and are known to be too
small (for these colloidal particles) to overcome thermal effects. Here we show
that collective effects may significantly modify the simple pair-wise
interactions and become important at higher density, though we remain well
below close packing throughout. In particular, we show that the interaction of
many interfacial particles can cause much larger interfacial deformations than
do isolated particles, and show that the energy of interaction per particle due
to this ""collective sinking"" grows as the number of interacting particles
grows. Though some of the parameters in our simple model are unknown, the
scaling behaviour is entirely consistent with experimental data, strongly
indicating that estimating interaction energy based solely on pair-wise
potentials may be too simplistic for surface particle layers.

scattering at hadron colliders will break down in a number of cases. This is
analogous to the well documented breakdown of an EFT description of dark matter
collider production. With this in mind, to diagnose whether or not the use of
simplified models at the LHC is valid, perturbative unitarity of the scattering
amplitude in the processes relevant to LHC dark matter searches is studied. The
results are as one would expect: at the LHC and future proton colliders the
simplified model descriptions of dark matter production are in general valid.

scalar mediator couples to electroweak vector bosons. The Fermiophobic
simplified model is well motivated and exhibits interesting collider and direct

challenge to the then favorite fast-mode wave model for coronal ""EIT waves"". It
encouraged the proposing of various non-wave models, and played an important
role in approaching the recent converging viewpoint, {\it i.e.} there are two
types of EUV waves. However, it was recently discovered that a stationary wave
front can also be generated when a fast-mode wave passes through a magnetic
quasi-separatrix layer (QSL). In this paper, we perform a magnetohydrodynamic
(MHD) numerical simulation of the interaction between a fast-mode wave and a
magnetic QSL, and a stationary wave front is reproduced. The analysis of the
numerical results indicates that near the plasma beta $\sim 1$ layer in front
of the magnetic QSL, part of the fast-mode wave is converted to a slow-mode MHD
wave, which is then trapped inside the magnetic loops, forming a stationary
wave front. Our research implies that we have to be cautious in identifying the
nature of a wave since there may be mode conversion during the propagation of
the waves driven by solar eruptions.

red-noise leakage and aliasing, in particular, when the observation spans a

has been shown that the brightenings and dimmings are mainly due to plasma
density increase and depletion, respectively. Such a spectacular phenomenon
sparked long-lasting interest and debates. The debates were concentrated on two
topics, one is about the driving source, and the other is about the nature of
this wavelike phenomenon. The controversies are most probably because there may
exist two types of large-scale coronal waves that were not well resolved before
the {\em Solar Dynamics Observatory} ({\em SDO}) was launched: one is a
piston-driven shock wave straddling over the erupting coronal mass ejection

to the CME frontal loop. Such a two-wave paradigm was proposed more than 13
years ago, and now is being recognized by more and more colleagues. In this

future technologies such as racetrack memories, in which data encoded in the

development of energy-efficient devices has been hampered by the high current
densities needed to initiate domain wall motion. We show here that a remarkable
reduction in the critical current density can be achieved for in-plane
magnetised coupled domain walls in CoFe/Ru/CoFe synthetic ferrimagnet tracks.
The antiferromagnetic exchange coupling between the layers leads to simple
N\'{e}el wall structures, imaged using photoemission electron and Lorentz
transmission electron microscopy, with a width of only $\sim 100$~nm. The
measured critical current density to set these walls in motion, detected using
magnetotransport measurements, is $1.0 \times 10^{11}$~Am$^{-2}$, almost an
order of magnitude lower than in a ferromagnetically coupled control sample.
Theoretical modelling indicates that this is due to nonadiabatic driving of
anisotropically coupled walls, a mechanism that can be used to design efficient
domain-wall devices.

formulations by exploiting the incompressibility constraint. For instance the
strain in the weak formulation can be replaced by the gradient to decouple the
velocity components in the different coordinate directions. Thus the
discretization of the simplified problem leads to fewer nonzero entries in the
stiffness matrix. This is of particular interest in large scale simulations
where a reduced memory bandwidth requirement can help to significantly
accelerate the computations. In the case of a piecewise constant viscosity, as
it typically arises in multi-phase flows, or when the boundary conditions
involve traction, the situation is more complex, and one has to treat the cross
derivatives in the original Stokes system with care. A naive application of the
standard vectorial Laplacian results in a physically incorrect solution, while
formulations based on the strain increase the computational effort everywhere,
even when the inconsistencies arise only from an incorrect treatment in a small
fraction of the computational domain. Here we propose a new approach that is
consistent with the strain-based formulation and preserves the decoupling
advantages of the gradient-based formulation in isoviscous subdomains. The
modification is equivalent to locally changing the discretization stencils,
hence the more expensive discretization is restricted to a lower dimensional
interface, making the additional computational cost asymptotically negligible.
We demonstrate the consistency and convergence properties of the method and
show that in a massively parallel setup, the multigrid solution of the
resulting discrete systems is faster than for the classical strain-based
formulation. Moreover, we give an application example which is inspired by
geophysical research.

they can facilitate advanced image / video coding techniques, such as graph
Fourier transform coding or motion prediction of arbitrarily shaped pixel
blocks. In this paper, we study the problem of lossless and lossy compression
of detected contours in images. Specifically, we first convert a detected
object contour composed of contiguous between-pixel edges to a sequence of
directional symbols drawn from a small alphabet. To encode the symbol sequence
using arithmetic coding, we compute an optimal variable-length context tree
(VCT) $\mathcal{T}$ via a maximum a posterior (MAP) formulation to estimate
symbols' conditional probabilities. MAP prevents us from overfitting given a
small training set $\mathcal{X}$ of past symbol sequences by identifying a VCT
$\mathcal{T}$ that achieves a high likelihood $P(\mathcal{X}|\mathcal{T})$ of
observing $\mathcal{X}$ given $\mathcal{T}$, and a large geometric prior
$P(\mathcal{T})$ stating that image contours are more often straight than
curvy. For the lossy case, we design efficient dynamic programming (DP)
algorithms that optimally trade off coding rate of an approximate contour
$\hat{\mathbf{x}}$ given a VCT $\mathcal{T}$ with two notions of distortion of
$\hat{\mathbf{x}}$ with respect to the original contour $\mathbf{x}$. To reduce
the size of the DP tables, a total suffix tree is derived from a given VCT
$\mathcal{T}$ for compact table entry indexing, reducing complexity.
Experimental results show that for lossless contour coding, our proposed
algorithm outperforms state-of-the-art context-based schemes consistently for
both small and large training datasets. For lossy contour coding, our
algorithms outperform comparable schemes in the literature in rate-distortion
performance.

well with the l-peaks of the simulated pattern obtained from the relaxed unit

The larger band gap of CH3NH3BaI3 compared to CH3NH3PbI3 can be attributed to
the lower electro-negativity coupled with the lack of d-orbitals in the valence

constrain the orientation of the outflow/envelope system. The distribution of
CS consists of an envelope component extending from north to south and a faint
butterfly-shaped outflow component. The kinematic structure of the envelope is
well reproduced by a simple ballistic model of an infalling rotating envelope.
Although the envelope has a nearly edge-on configuration, the inclination angle
of the rotation axis from the plane of the sky is found to be 5$^\circ$, where
we find that the western side of the envelope faces the observer. This
configuration is opposite to the direction of the large-scale ($\sim$ 10$^4$
AU) outflow suggested previously from the $^{12}$CO ($J$=3$-$2) observation,
and to the morphology of infrared reflection near the protostar ($\sim$ 200
AU). The latter discrepancy could originate from high extinction by the outflow
cavity of the western side, these discrepancies or may indicate that the
outflow axis is not parallel to the rotation axis of the envelope.
Position-velocity diagrams show the accelerated outflow cavity wall, and its
kinematic structure in the 2000 AU scale is explained by a standard parabolic
model with the inclination angle derived from the analysis of the envelope. The
different orientation of the outflow between the small and large scale implies
a possibility of precession of the outflow axis. The shape and the velocity of
the outflow in the vicinity of the protostar are compared with those of other
protostars.

relative fractal drum (or RFD, in short) is an ordered pair $(A,\Omega)$ of
subsets of the Euclidean space (under some mild assumptions) which generalizes
the notion of a (compact) subset and that of a fractal string. By a fractal
tube formula for an RFD $(A,\Omega)$, we mean an explicit expression for the
volume of the $t$-neighborhood of $A$ intersected by $\Omega$ as a sum of
residues of a suitable meromorphic function (here, a fractal zeta function)
over the complex dimensions of the RFD $(A,\Omega)$. The complex dimensions of
an RFD are defined as the poles of its meromorphically continued fractal zeta
function (namely, the distance or the tube zeta function), which generalizes
the well-known geometric zeta function for fractal strings. These fractal tube
formulas generalize in a significant way to higher dimensions the corresponding
ones previously obtained for fractal strings by the first author and van
Frankenhuijsen and later on, by the first author, Pearse and Winter in the case
of fractal sprays. They are illustrated by several interesting examples. These
examples include fractal strings, the Sierpi\'nski gasket and the 3-dimensional
carpet, fractal nests and geometric chirps, as well as self-similar fractal
sprays. We also propose a new definition of fractality according to which a
bounded set (or RFD) is considered to be fractal if it possesses at least one
nonreal complex dimension or if its fractal zeta function possesses a natural
boundary. This definition, which extends to RFDs and arbitrary bounded subsets
of $\mathbb{R}^N$ the previous one introduced in the context of fractal
strings, is illustrated by the Cantor graph (or devil's staircase) RFD, which
is shown to be `subcritically fractal'.

the most fundamental process, the scattering of a single photon by a single
atom, is largely unexplored [1-3]. One prominent prediction of quantum optics
is the deterministic absorption of a traveling photon by a single atom,
provided the photon waveform matches spatially and temporally the time-reversed
version of a spontaneously emitted photon [4-12]. Here, we experimentally
address this prediction and investigate the influence of the temporal profile
of the photon on the scattering dynamics using a single trapped atom and
heralded single photons. In a time-resolved measurement of the atomic
excitation we find a 56(11)% increase of the peak excitation by photons with an
exponentially rising profile compared to a decaying one. This result

neutron star Cen X-4, over 6 orders of magnitude in X-ray luminosity, from
outburst to quiescence. After subtracting the contribution from the companion
star, the Cen X-4 data can be described by a single power law correlation of
the form $L_{opt}\propto\,L_{X}^{0.44}$, consistent with disk reprocessing. We
find a similar correlation slope for V404 Cyg in quiescence (0.46) and a
steeper one (0.56) in the outburst hard state of 1989. However, V404 Cyg is
about $160-280$ times optically brighter, at a given $3-9$ keV X-ray
luminosity, compared to Cen X-4. This ratio is a factor of 10 smaller in
quiescence, where the normalization of the V404 Cyg correlation also changes.
We show that once the bolometric X-ray emission is considered and the known
main differences between V404 Cyg and Cen X-4 are taken into account (a larger
compact object mass, accretion disk size, and the presence of a strong jet
contribution in the hard state for the black hole system) the two systems lie
on the same correlation. In V404 Cyg, the jet dominates spectrally at
optical-infrared frequencies during the hard state, but makes a negligible
contribution in quiescence, which may account for the change in its correlation
slope and normalization. These results provide a benchmark to compare with data
from the 2015 outburst of V404 Cyg and, potentially, other transient LMXBs as

i.e., states and operations which can be created and performed at no cost. In
the resource theory of coherence free states are diagonal in some fixed basis,
and free operations are those which cannot create coherence for some particular
experimental realization. Recently, some problems of this approach have been
discussed, and new sets of operations have been proposed to resolve these
problems. As an example for such a problem, a quantum operation can be
incoherent in one particular experimental realization, but it still can create
large amount of coherence in another. This problem is resolved by the framework
of genuine quantum coherence. Here, we investigate this concept further and
study other more general sets of operations which cannot create coherence in
any experimental realization. We analyze in detail the mathematical structure
of this class of maps and use this to study possible state transformations
under these operations. We show that deterministic manipulation is severely
limited, even in the asymptotic settings. In particular, this framework does
not have a unique golden unit, i.e., there is no single state from which all
other states can be created deterministically with the free operations. On the
other hand, we show that these theories allow for a richer structure in what
comes to stochastic manipulation of states. In particular, we determine the
optimal probability of conversion among pure states with genuinely incoherent
operations. Still, the aforementioned limitations suggest that any reasonably
powerful resource theory of coherence must contain free operations which can
potentially create coherence in some experimental realization.

discrepancies are the result of magnetic inhibition of convection in cool young
stars by using magnetic stellar evolution isochrones to determine the age of
the Upper Scorpius subgroup of the Scorpius-Centaurus OB Association. A median
age of 10 Myr consistent across spectral types A through M is found, except for
a subset of F-type stars that appear significantly older. Agreement is shown
for ages derived from the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram and from the empirical
mass-radius relationship defined by eclipsing multiple-star systems. Surface
magnetic field strengths required to produce agreement are of order 2.5 kG and
are predicted from a priori estimates of equipartition values. A region in the
HR diagram is identified that plausibly connects stars whose structures are
weakly influenced by the presence of magnetic fields with those whose
structures are strongly influenced by magnetic fields. The models suggest this
region is characterized by stars with rapidly thinning outer convective
envelopes where the radiative core mass is greater than 75% of the total
stellar mass. Furthermore, depletion of lithium predicted from magnetic models
appears in better agreement with observed lithium equivalent widths than
predictions from non-magnetic models. These results suggest that magnetic
inhibition of convection plays an important role in the early evolution of
low-mass stars and that it may be responsible for noted age discrepancies in
young stellar populations.

processor. Consequently, processors spend a long time waiting to access data
from main memory, making the long main memory access latency one of the most
critical bottlenecks to achieving high system performance. Unfortunately, the
latency of DRAM has remained almost constant in the past decade. This is mainly
because DRAM has been optimized for cost-per-bit, rather than access latency.
As a result, DRAM latency is not reducing with technology scaling, and
continues to be an important performance bottleneck in modern and future
systems.
  This dissertation seeks to achieve low latency DRAM-based memory systems at
low cost in three major directions. First, based on the observation that long
bitlines in DRAM are one of the dominant sources of DRAM latency, we propose a
new DRAM architecture, Tiered-Latency DRAM (TL-DRAM), which divides the long
bitline into two shorter segments using an isolation transistor, allowing one
segment to be accessed with reduced latency. Second, we propose a fine-grained
DRAM latency reduction mechanism, Adaptive-Latency DRAM, which optimizes DRAM
latency for the common operating conditions for individual DRAM module. Third,
we propose a new technique, Architectural-Variation-Aware DRAM (AVA-DRAM),
which reduces DRAM latency at low cost, by profiling and identifying only the
inherently slower regions in DRAM to dynamically determine the lowest latency
DRAM can operate at without causing failures.
  This dissertation provides a detailed analysis of DRAM latency by using both
circuit-level simulation with a detailed DRAM model and FPGA-based profiling of
real DRAM modules. Our latency analysis shows that our low latency DRAM
mechanisms enable significant latency reductions, leading to large improvement
in both system performance and energy efficiency.

field is an important problem in computational quantum mechanics. It also
provides a nice example of a differential equation whose flow can be split with
benefit into three parts. After presenting a splitting approach for three
operators with two of them being unbounded, we exemplarily prove first-order
convergence of Lie splitting in this framework. The result is then applied to
the magnetic Schr\""odinger equation, which is split into its potential, kinetic
and advective parts. The latter requires special treatment in order not to lose
the conservation properties of the scheme. We discuss several options.
Numerical examples in one, two and three space dimensions show that the method
of characteristics coupled with a nonequispaced fast Fourier transform (NFFT)
provides a fast and reliable technique for achieving mass conservation at the
discrete level.

twin of the well-known SN 1993J. Previous studies revealed many, but not all
interesting properties of this event. Our goal was to add new understanding of
both the early and late-time phases of SN 2013df. Our spectral analysis is
based on 6 optical spectra obtained with the 9.2m Hobby-Eberly Telescope during
the first month after explosion, complemented by a near-infrared spectrum. We
applied the SYNAPPS spectral synthesis code to constrain the chemical
composition and physical properties of the ejecta. A principal result is the
identification of ""high-velocity"" He I lines in the early spectra of SN 2013df,
manifest as the blue component of the double-troughed profile at ~5650 A. This
finding, together with the lack of clear separation of H and He lines in
velocity space, indicates that both H and He features form at the outer
envelope during the early phases. We also obtained ground-based BVRI and
g'r'i'z' photometric data up to +45 days and unfiltered measurements with the
ROTSE-IIIb telescope up to +168 days. From the modelling of the early-time
quasi-bolometric light curve, we find $M_{ej} \sim 3.2-4.6 M_{\odot}$ and
$E_{kin} \sim 2.6-2.8 \times 10^{51}$ erg for the initial ejecta mass and the
initial kinetic energy, respectively, which agree well with the values derived
from the separate modelling of the light-curve tail. Late-time mid-infrared
excess indicates circumstellar interaction starting ~1 year after explosion, in
accordance with previously published optical, X-ray, and radio data.

Attouch states that the Mosco convergence of a

More precisely, while it has already been known that the Mosco convergence of a
sequence of convex lower semicontinuous functions on a Hadamard space implies
the pointwise convergence of the corresponding Moreau envelopes, the converse
implication was an open question. We now fill this gap.
  Our result has several consequences. It implies, for instance, the
equivalence of the Mosco and Frol\'ik-Wijsman convergences of convex sets. As
another application, we show that there exists a complete metric on the cone of

for the method is the evaluation of the overlap Dirac operator in lattice
Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) at finite chemical potential, which requires the
application of the sign function of a non-Hermitian matrix to some source

fluid flows aiming at the optimisation of long-time averages of flow quantities
is presented. It applies to reduced-order finite-dimensional models of fluid
flows, expressed as a set of first-order nonlinear ordinary differential
equations with the right-hand side being a polynomial function in the state
variables and in the controls. The key idea, first discussed in Chernyshenko et
al. 2014, Philos. T. Roy. Soc. 372(2020), is that the difficulties of treating
and optimising long-time averages of a cost are relaxed by using the
upper/lower bounds of such averages as the objective function. In this setting,
control design reduces to finding a feedback controller that optimises the
bound, subject to a polynomial inequality constraint involving the cost
function, the nonlinear system, the controller itself and a tunable polynomial
function. A numerically tractable approach to the solution of such optimisation
problems, based on Sum-of-Squares techniques and semidefinite programming, is
proposed.
  To showcase the methodology, the mitigation of the fluctuation kinetic energy
in the unsteady wake behind a circular cylinder in the laminar regime at
Re=100, via controlled angular motions of the surface, is numerically
investigated. A compact reduced-order model that resolves the long-term
behaviour of the fluid flow and the effects of actuation, is derived using
Proper Orthogonal Decomposition and Galerkin projection. In a full-information
setting, feedback controllers are then designed to reduce the long-time average
of the kinetic energy associated with the limit cycle. These controllers are
then implemented in direct numerical simulations of the actuated flow. Control
performance, energy efficiency, and physical control mechanisms identified are
analysed. Key elements, implications and future work are discussed.

while near the transition temperature the damping shows exponential-like

quasiparticles more efficient at elevated temperatures. We also reveal that the

carried out by using the notion of linearizability and specifying the
linearization points of the data structure's procedures. Such arguments are
often cumbersome as the linearization points' position in time can be dynamic
(depend on the interference, run-time values and events from the past, or even
future), non-local (appear in procedures other than the one considered), and
whose position in the execution trace may only be determined after the
considered procedure has already terminated.
  In this paper we propose a new method, based on a separation-style logic, for
reasoning about concurrent objects with such linearization points. We embrace
the dynamic nature of linearization points, and encode it as part of the data
structure's auxiliary state, so that it can be dynamically modified in place by
auxiliary code, as needed when some appropriate run-time event occurs. We name
the idea linking-in-time, because it reduces temporal reasoning to spatial
reasoning. For example, modifying a temporal position of a linearization point
can be modeled similarly to a pointer update in separation logic. Furthermore,
the auxiliary state provides a convenient way to concisely express the
properties essential for reasoning about clients of such concurrent objects. We
illustrate the method by verifying (mechanically in Coq) an intricate optimal
snapshot algorithm due to Jayanti, as well as some clients.

various measures as a function of hole size. This result supports the
proposition that there is no well-defined $D_c$ and that clogging is always
possible. Furthermore, the intermittency time scale of the flow is set by the
speed of the grains at the hopper exit. This latter finding is consistent with
a model of clogging as the independent sampling for stable configurations at

localization capabilities to mobile devices navigating within previously mapped
areas. To this end, we introduce the Cholesky-Schmidt-Kalman filter (C-SKF),
which explicitly considers the uncertainty of the prior map, by employing the
sparse Cholesky factor of the map's Hessian, instead of its dense
covariance--as is the case for the Schmidt-Kalman filter (SKF). By doing so,
the C-SKF has memory requirements typically linear in the size of the map, as
opposed to quadratic for storing the map's covariance. Moreover, and in order
to bound the processing needs of the C-SKF (between linear and quadratic in the
size of the map), we introduce a relaxation of the C-SKF algorithm, the sC-SKF,
which operates on the Cholesky factors of independent sub-maps resulting from
dividing the trajectory and observations used for constructing the map into
overlapping segments. Lastly, we assess the processing and memory requirements
of the proposed C-SKF and sC-SKF algorithms, and compare their positioning
accuracy against other approximate map-based localization approaches that
employ measurement-noise-covariance inflation to compensate for the map's
uncertainty.

Different from existing works focusing on combining multi-modal features, we go
one step further by adding and exploiting subclasses visually related to
violence. We enrich the MediaEval 2015 violence dataset by \emph{manually}
labeling violence videos with respect to the subclasses. Such fine-grained
annotations not only help understand what have impeded previous efforts on
learning to fuse the multi-modal features, but also enhance the generalization
ability of the learned fusion to novel test data. The new subclass based
solution, with AP of 0.303 and P100 of 0.55 on the MediaEval 2015 test set,
outperforms several state-of-the-art alternatives. Notice that our solution
does not require fine-grained annotations on the test set, so it can be
directly applied on novel and fully unlabeled videos. Interestingly, our study
shows that motion related features, though being essential part in previous
systems, are dispensable.

challenge with our task is that each line-scan is in a different (unknown)

This problem arises due to the limited angular measurement range of the
autocollimator used in the deflectometer and the need to measure over a greater
range; this results in the optic under measurement being rotated (in pitch and
roll) between each scan to bring the autocollimator back into measurement range
and therefore each scan is taken in a different coordinate frame. We describe
an approach using a 6N+2 dimension optimisation (where N is the number of scan
lines taken across the mirror) that uses a gradient-based non-linear least
squares fitting combined with a multi-start global search strategy to find the
best-fit surface. Careful formulation of the problem is required to reduce
numerical noise and allow the routine to converge on a solution of the required

other, are typically subjected to velocity gradients, ranging from the pore
scale to the catchment scale due to permeability variations and flow line
geometries. A common trait of these processes is that the mixing interface is
strained by shear. Depending on the P\'eclet number $Pe$, which represents the
ratio of the characteristic diffusion time to the characteristic advection
time, and the Damk\""ohler number $Da$, which represents the ratio of the
characteristic diffusion time to the characteristic reaction time, the local
reaction rates can be strongly impacted by the dynamics of the mixing
interface. This impact has been characterized mostly either in kinetics-limited
or in mixing-limited conditions, that is, for either very low or very high
$Da$. Here the coupling of shear flow and chemical reactivity is investigated
for arbitrary Damk\""ohler numbers, for a bimolecular reaction and an initial
interface with separated reactants. Approximate analytical expressions for the
global production rate and reactive mixing scale are derived based on a
reactive lamella approach that allows for a general coupling between stretching
enhanced mixing and chemical reactions. While for $Pe<Da$, reaction kinetics
and stretching effects are decoupled, a scenario which we name ""weak
stretching"", for $Pe>Da$, we uncover a ""strong stretching"" scenario where new
scaling laws emerge from the interplay between reaction kinetics, diffusion,
and stretching. The analytical results are validated against numerical
simulations. These findings shed light on the effect of flow heterogeneity on
the enhancement of chemical reaction and the creation of spatially localized
hotspots of reactivity for a broad range of systems ranging from kinetic
limited to mixing limited situations.

the FBE and its gradient can be computed by simply evaluating forward-backward

properties of FBS when the problem is convex, or when the objective function
possesses the Kurdyka-{\L}ojasiewicz property at its critical points. Moreover,
when using quasi-Newton directions the proposed method achieves superlinear
convergence provided that usual second-order sufficiency conditions on the FBE
hold at the limit point of the generated sequence. Such conditions translate
into milder requirements on the original function involving generalized
second-order differentiability. We show that BFGS fits our framework and that
the limited-memory variant L-BFGS is well suited for large-scale problems,
greatly outperforming FBS or its accelerated version in practice. The analysis
of superlinear convergence is based on an extension of the Dennis and Mor\'e

to be interpolated could be the charge density between atoms in condensed

integrals. Periodicity is not required. The interpolation functions are
localized structure-adapted linear combinations of spherical waves, socalled
unitary spherical waves (USWs), centered at the spheres where they have
cubic-harmonic character. Input to the interpolation are the coefficients in
the cubic-harmonic expansion of the target function at and slightly outside the
spheres; specifically, the values and 3 first radial derivatives. To fit this,
we use USWs with 4 negative energies. Each interpolation function is actually a
linear combination of these 4 sets of USWs with the following properties: (1)
It is centered at a specific sphere where it has a specific cubic-harmonic
character and radial derivative. (2) Its value and first 3 radial derivatives
vanish at all other spheres and for all other cubic-harmonics. It is therefore
highly localized. Explicit expressions are given for these value-and-derivative
(v&d) functions and their Coulomb potentials in terms of the USWs and their
structure matrix, including those with zero energy, as well as for integrals
over the interstitial of the v&d functions and of their products. Use of point-
and space-group symmetries can significantly reduce matrix sizes and the number
of v&d functions. For open structures, additional constraints are needed to
pinpoint the interpolated function deep in the interstitial. This requires the
USW set at one extra energy. As examples, we consider a constant density and
the valence-electron densities in zinc-blende structured Si, ZnSe, and CuBr.

in the context of the statistical mechanics theory of non covalent bonding in

the binding free energies evaluation in computer simulations are rooted in the
equilibrium assumption that is implicit in the reversible method. These
critical issues can be resolved by using a non-equilibrium variant of the
alchemical method in molecular dynamics simulations, relying on the production
of many independent trajectories with a continuous dynamical evolution of an
externally driven alchemical coordinate, completing the decoupling of the
ligand in a matter of few tens of picoseconds rather than nanoseconds. The
absolute binding free energy can be recovered from the annihilation work
distributions by applying an unbiased unidirectional free energy estimate, on
the assumption that any observed work distribution is given by a mixture of
normal distributions, whose components are identical in either direction of the
non-equilibrium process, with weights regulated by the Crooks theorem. I
finally show that the inherent reliability and accuracy of the unidirectional
estimate of the decoupling free energies, based on the production of few
hundreds of non-equilibrium independent sub-nanoseconds unrestrained alchemical
annihilation processes, is a direct consequence of the funnel-like shape of the
free energy surface in molecular recognition. An application of the technique
on a real drug-receptor system is presented in the companion paper.

theory, and dynamics of Josephson vortices trapped inside insulators are
studied. Starting from a theory consisting of complex and real scalar fields
coupled to a U(1) gauge field which admit parallel $N-1$ domain-wall solutions,
Josephson couplings are introduced weakly between the complex scalar fields.
The $N-1$ domain walls behave as insulators separating $N$ superconductors,
where one of the complex scalar fields has a gap. We construct the effective
Lagrangian on the domain walls, which reduces to a coupled sine-Gordon model
for well-separated walls We then construct sine-Gordon solitons emerging in an
effective theory in which we identify Josephson vortices carrying singly
quantized magnetic fluxes. When two neighboring superconductors tend to have
the same phase, the ground state does not change with the positions of domain
walls. On the other hand, when two neighboring superconductors tend to have
$\pi$-phase differences, the ground state has a phase transition depending on
the positions of domain walls; when the two walls are close to each other,
frustration occurs because of the coupling between the two superconductors
besides the thin superconductor. Focusing on the case of three superconductors
separated by two insulators, we find for the former case that the interaction
between two Josephson vortices on different insulators changes its nature,
i.e., attractive or repulsive, depending on the positions of the domain walls.
In the latter case, there emerges fractional Josephson vortices when two
degenerate ground states appear due to spontaneous charge-symmetry breaking,
and the number of the Josephson vortices varies with the position of the domain
walls. Our predictions should be verified in multilayered Josephson junctions.

These diagrams comprise the locus of homoclinic orbits together with the lines
of limit points bounding the region of multiple steady states as well as the
locus of the points of Hopf bifurcation. Thus, they define a set of parameters
for which homoclinic bifurcation can take place. They also make it possible to
determine conditions under which homoclinic orbits are generated. Two kinds of
homoclinic orbits have been observed, namely semistable and unstable orbits. It
is found that the character of the homoclinic orbit depends on the stability
features of the limit cycle which is linked with the saddle point. Very

inducing quantum resonance in a finite-temperature laser-driven atomic gas. We
use Monte Carlo simulations to investigate these quantum resonances in the
regime where the gas receives laser pulses of finite duration, and demonstrate
that an $\epsilon$-classical model for the dynamics of the gas atoms is capable
of reproducing quantum resonant behavior for both zero-temperature and
finite-temperature non-interacting gases. We show that this model agrees well
with the fully quantum treatment of the system over a time-scale set by the
choice of experimental parameters. We also show that this model is capable of
correctly treating the time-reversal mechanism necessary for implementing an
interferometer with this physical configuration.

stable vertical salinity profiles is studied in the laboratory. Based on
two-dimensional horizontal particle image velocimetry (PIV) data, and infrared
camera visualizations, we describe the appearance and the characteristics of
the baroclinic instability in this original configuration. First, we show that
when the salinity profile is linear and confined between two non stratified
layers at top and bottom, only two separate shallow fluid layers can be
destabilized. These unstable layers appear nearby the top and the bottom of the
tank with a stratified motionless zone between them. This laboratory
arrangement is thus particularly interesting to model geophysical or
astrophysical situations where stratified regions are often juxtaposed to
convective ones. Then, for more general but stable initial density profiles,
statistical measures are introduced to quantify the extent of the baroclinic
instability at given depths and to analyze the connections between this
depth-dependence and the vertical salinity profiles. We find that, although the
presence of stable stratification generally hinders full-depth overturning,
double-diffusive convection can yield development of multicellular sideways
convection in shallow layers and subsequently to a multilayered baroclinic
instability. Therefore we conclude that by decreasing the characteristic
vertical scale of the flow, stratification may even enhance the formation of
cyclonic and anticyclonic eddies (and thus, mixing) in a local sense.

the static response function, the kinetic and interaction energies. By reducing
the layer spacing we observe a transition from weakly to strongly bound dimer
states. The transition is accompanied by the onset of short-range correlations,
suppression of the superfluid response, and rotonization of the excitation
spectrum. A dispersion law and a dynamic structure factor for the {\em
in-phase} (symmetric) and {\em out-of-phase} (antisymmetric) collective modes,
during the dimerization, is studied in detail with the stochastic
reconstruction method and the method of moments. The antisymmetric mode
spectrum is most strongly influenced by suppression of the inlayer
superfluidity (specified by the superfluid fraction $\gamma_s=\rho_s/\rho$). In
a pure superfluid/normal phase only an acoustic/optical(gapped) mode is
recovered. In a partially superfluid phase, both are present simultaneously,
and the dispersion splits into two branches corresponding to a normal and a
superfluid component. The spectral weight of the acoustic mode scales linearly
with $\gamma_s$. This weight transfers to the optical branch when $\gamma_s$ is
reduced due to formation of dimer states. In summary, we demonstrate how the
interlayer dimerization in dipolar bilayers can be uniquely identified by

physically-motivated Supernova feedback and chemical evolution. The metallicity

numerical findings with results from the CALIFA Survey. The simulated stellar
discs are found to have metallicity profiles with slopes in global agreement
with observations. Low stellar-mass galaxies tend to have a larger variety of
metallicity slopes. When normalized by the half-mass radius, the stellar
metallicity gradients do not show any dependence and the dispersion increases
significantly, regardless of galaxy mass. Galaxies with stellar masses around
$10^{10}$M$_{\odot}$ show steeper negative metallicity gradients. The stellar
metallicity gradients correlate with the half-mass radius. However, the
correlation signal is not present when they are normalized by the half-mass

and positive metallicity gradients, depending on the relative importance of the
recent star formation activity in the central regions. The large dispersions in
the metallicity gradients as a function of stellar mass could be ascribed to
the effects of dynamical processes such as mergers/interactions and/or

manipulation of waves, especially focusing on slowing down their propagation.
In electromagnetism, from microwave to optics, as well as in acoustics or for
elastic waves, slow wave propagation indeed largely benefits both applied and
fundamental physics. It is for instance essential in analog signal computing
through the design of components such as delay lines and buffers, and it is one
of the prerequisite for increased wave/matter interactions. Despite the
interest of a broad community, researches have mostly been conducted in optics
along with the development of wavelength scaled structured composite media,
that appear promising candidates for compact slow light components. Yet their
minimum structural scale prevents them from being transposed to lower
frequencies where wavelengths range from sub-millimeter to meters. In this
article, we propose to overcome this limitation thanks to the deep
sub-wavelength scale of locally resonant metamaterials. In our approach,
implemented here in the microwave regime, we show that introducing coupled
resonant defects in such composite media allows the creation of deep
sub-wavelength waveguides. We experimentally demonstrate that waves, while
propagating in such waveguides, exhibit largely reduced group velocities. We
qualitatively explain the mechanism underlying this slow wave propagation and
first experimentally demonstrate, then numerically verify, how it can be taken
advantage of to tune the velocity, achieving group indices ng as high as 227
over relatively large bandwidths. We conclude by highlighting the three
beneficial consequences of our line defect slow wave waveguides in locally
resonant metamaterials: the deep sub-wavelength scale, the very large group
indices and the fact that slow wave propagation does not occur at the expense
of drastic bandwidth reductions.

with the pre developed spline function.Different statistical measures namely
classification accuracy, true positive and negative rates, false positive and
negative rates and precision are utilized to assess the performance of the
proposed models. These metrics are derived from confusion matrices obtained
from classifiers. Different classifiers are used over the original dataset and
the set of extracted features. The proposed models significantly reduce the
dimension of the classification problem and the computational time while the
classification accuracy is improved in most cases. The first and third models
are promising feature extraction methods. Logistic, LazyIB1, LazyIB5 and J48
are the best classifiers. Their true positive and negative rates are $1$ while
false positive and negative rates are zero and the corresponding precision
values are $1$. Numerical results suggest that these models are robust and
efficient for detecting epileptic seizure.

(sometimes referred to as misaligned active galactic nuclei) could be
responsible for a significant fraction of the observed diffuse gamma-ray
background. In this study, we use the latest data from the Fermi Gamma-Ray
Space Telescope to characterize the gamma-ray emission from a sample of 51
radio galaxies. In addition to those sources that had previously been detected
using Fermi data, we report here the first statistically significant detection
of gamma-ray emission from the radio galaxies 3C 212, 3C 411, and B3 0309+411B.
Combining this information with the radio fluxes, radio luminosity function,
and redshift distribution of this source class, we find that radio galaxies
dominate the diffuse gamma-ray background, generating $77.2^{+25.4}_{-9.4}\%$
of this emission at energies above $\sim$1 GeV. We discuss the implications of
this result and point out that it provides support for scenarios in which
IceCube's high-energy astrophysical neutrinos also originate from the same
population of radio galaxies.

generalizing classical tools in signal processing, in order to analyze signals
evolving on complex domains. Such domains are represented by graphs, for which
one can compute a particular matrix, called the normalized Laplacian. It was
shown that the eigenvalues of this Laplacian correspond to the frequencies of
the Fourier domain in classical signal processing. Therefore, the frequency
domain is not the same for every support graph. A consequence of this is that
there is no non-trivial generalization of Heisenberg's uncertainty principle,
that states that a signal cannot be fully localized both in the time domain and
in the frequency domain. A way to generalize this principle, introduced by
Agaskar and Lu, consists in determining a curve that represents a lower bound
on the compromise between precision in the graph domain and precision in the
spectral domain. The aim of this paper is to propose a characterization of the
signals achieving this curve, for a larger class of graphs than the one studied
by Agaskar and Lu.

both are modern learning tools. Moreover, the latter is an extension and a
subset of the former. However, there are few limitations or differences still
exist in mobile learning tools, especially in the design, development and the

years. A lot of techniques have arised, inspired by classical signal processing
ones, to allow studying signals on any kind of graph. A common aspect of these
technique is that they require a graph correctly modeling the studied support
to explain the signals that are observed on it. However, in many cases, such a
graph is unavailable or has no real physical existence. An example of this
latter case is a set of sensors randomly thrown in a field which obviously
observe related information. To study such signals, there is no intuitive
choice for a support graph. In this document, we address the problem of
inferring a graph structure from the observation of signals, under the
assumption that they were issued of the diffusion of initially i.i.d. signals.
To validate our approach, we design an experimental protocol, in which we
diffuse signals on a known graph. Then, we forget the graph, and show that we
are able to retrieve it very precisely from the only knowledge of the diffused
signals.

This
situation is present not only in decisions about complex issues, e.g.,
political or academic choices, but also about trivial ones, as in daily
purchases at a supermarket. We tackle this scenario by means of the tools of
statistical mechanics. Following this approach, we introduce and analyze a
model of opinion dynamics, using a Potts-like state variable to represent the
multiple choices, including the ``undecided state'', that represents the
individuals that do not make a choice. We investigate the dynamics over
Erd\""{o}s-R\'enyi and Barab\'asi-Albert networks, two paradigmatic classes with
the small-world property, and we show the impact of the type of network on the
opinion dynamics. Depending on the number of available options $q$ and on the
degree distribution of the network of contacts, different final steady states
are accessible: from a wide distribution of choices to a state where a given
option largely dominates. The abrupt transition between them is consistent with
the sudden viral dominance of a given option over many similar ones. Moreover,
the probability distributions produced by the model are validated by real data.
Finally, we show that the model also contemplates the real situation of
overchoice, where a large number of similar alternatives makes the choice
process harder and indecision prevail.
