spherically-symmetric systems and compare it with the widely-used
Lema\^itre-Tolman-Bondi (LTB) model. In particular, we focus on the issues of
gauge ambiguity and the use of comoving versus 'physical' coordinate systems.
We also clarify the correspondences between the two approaches, and illustrate
their differences by applying them to the classic examples of the Schwarzschild
and Friedmann-Robertson-Walker spacetimes. We demonstrate that the tetrad-based
method does not suffer from the gauge freedoms inherent to the LTB model,
naturally accommodates non-zero pressure and has a more transparent physical
interpretation. We further apply our tetrad-based method to a generalised form
of 'Swiss cheese' model, which consists of an interior spherical region
surrounded by a spherical shell of vacuum that is embedded in an exterior
background universe. In general, we allow the fluid in the interior and
exterior regions to support pressure, and do not demand that the interior
region be compensated. We pay particular attention to the form of the solution
in the intervening vacuum region and verify the validity of Birkhoff's theorem
at both the metric and tetrad level. We then reconsider critically the original
theoretical arguments underlying the so-called $R_h = ct$ cosmological model,
which has recently received considerable attention. These considerations in
turn illustrate the interesting behaviour of a number of 'horizons' in general
cosmological models.

processes. In the synthesis of stochastic reactive processes, the traditional
model is perfect-information stochastic games, where some transitions of the
game graph are controlled by two adversarial players, and the other transitions
are executed probabilistically. We consider such games where the objective is
the conjunction of several quantitative objectives (specified as mean-payoff
conditions), which we refer to as generalized mean-payoff objectives. The basic
decision problem asks for the existence of a finite-memory strategy for a
player that ensures the generalized mean-payoff objective be satisfied with a
desired probability against all strategies of the opponent. A special case of
the decision problem is the almost-sure problem where the desired probability
is 1. Previous results presented a semi-decision procedure for
epsilon-approximations of the almost-sure problem. In this work, we show that
both the almost-sure problem as well as the general basic decision problem are
coNP-complete, significantly improving the previous results. Moreover, we show
that in the case of 1-player stochastic games, randomized memoryless strategies
are sufficient and the problem can be solved in polynomial time. In contrast,
in two-player stochastic games, we show that even with randomized strategies
exponential memory is required in general, and present a matching exponential
upper bound. We also study the basic decision problem with infinite-memory
strategies and present computational complexity results for the problem. Our
results are relevant in the synthesis of stochastic reactive systems with

standard multi-armed bandit problem give algorithms for which queue-regret
increases no more than logarithmically in time. Our paper shows surprisingly
more complex behavior. In particular, as long as the bandit algorithm's queues
have relatively long regenerative cycles, queue-regret is similar to cumulative
regret, and scales (essentially) logarithmically. However, we show that this

using the same path quantifiers and temporal operators as in CTL, but allowing
a different order of the quantifiers. This small syntactic variation induces a
logic that can express non-regular properties for which known extensions of MSO
with equality of path length are undecidable. We show that our variant of CTL
is decidable and that the model-checking problem is in Delta_3^P = P^{NP^NP},
and is DP-hard. We analogously consider quantifier exchange in extensions of
CTL, and we present operators defined using basic operators of CTL* that
express the occurrence of infinitely many synchronization points. We show that
the model-checking problem remains in Delta_3^P. The distinguishing power of
CTL and of our new logic coincide if the Next operator is allowed in the
logics, thus the classical bisimulation quotient can be used for state-space
reduction before model checking.

which it is not possible to define a Supersymmetry Charge. SUSY is defined in
these new Actions by the fact that they satisfy Master Equations. The new SUSY
Actions are very easy to write down. One simply takes a Chiral SUSY Action,
coupled to Gauge and other Chiral Multiplets, and even SuperGravity, if
desired. Then one creates a new Action from this by exchanging all or part of
the Scalar Field $S$ for a new Zinn Source $J$, and the corresponding part of
the Zinn Source $\Gamma$ for a new Antighost Field $\eta$. Since the original
Action satisfies a Master Equation, this exchange guarantees that the new
Action will satisfy the new Master Equation. As was shown in the earlier paper,
the new multiplets have fewer bosonic degrees of freedom than fermionic degrees
of freedom. This is possible because they do not have a Supercharge.
  The resulting new SSM has no need for Squarks or Sleptons. It does not need
spontaneous breaking of SUSY, so that the cosmological constant problem does
not arise (at least at tree level). It mimics the usual non-supersymmetric
Standard Model very well, and the absence of large flavour changing neutral
currents is natural. There is no need for a hidden sector, or a messenger
sector, or explicit `soft' breaking of SUSY. Spontaneous Gauge Symmetry
Breaking implies the existence of two new very heavy Higgs Bosons with mass
13.4 TeV, slightly smaller than the energy of the LHC at 14 TeV. There is also
a curious set of Gauginos and Higgsinos which have exactly the same masses as
the Higgs and Gauge Bosons. These do not couple to the Quarks and Leptons,
except through the Higgs and Gauge Bosons.

An increasing number of sources of data are becoming available, introducing a

setting, the posterior distribution of the models, based on the observed data,
can be viewed as a relevant measure for the model evidence. The number of
possible models increases exponentially in the number of candidate variables.
Moreover, the space of models has numerous local extrema in terms of posterior
model probabilities. To resolve these issues a novel MCMC algorithm for the

introduced. The algorithm is based on that marginal likelihoods can be
efficiently calculated within each model. It is recommended that either exact

systems by investigating the long-standing conjecture that the maximally
symmetry-breaking quantum ground states are the most classical ones
corresponding to a globally ordered phase. We make this argument quantitatively
precise by comparing different local and global indicators of classicality and
quantumness, respectively in symmetry-breaking and symmetry-preserving quantum
ground states. We first discuss how naively comparing local, pairwise
entanglement and discord apparently leads to the opposite conclusion. Indeed,
we show that in symmetry-preserving ground states the two-body entanglement
captures only a modest portion of the total two-body quantum correlations,
while, on the contrary, in maximally symmetry-breaking ground states it
contributes the largest amount to the total two-body quantum correlations. We
then put to test the conjecture by looking at the global, macroscopic
correlation properties of quantum ground states. We prove that the ground
states which realize the maximum breaking of the Hamiltonian symmetries,
associated to a globally ordered phase, are the only ones that: I) are always
locally convertible, i.e. can be obtained from all other ground states by only
applying LOCC transformations (local operations and classical communication),
while the reverse is never possible; II) minimize the monogamy inequality on

instigated a surge of interest in non-equilibrium physics, including many-body
dynamics of trapped ultracold atoms and ions, near-field radiative heat
transfer, and quantum friction. Under most circumstances the complexity of such
non-equilibrium systems requires a number of approximations to make theoretical
descriptions tractable. In particular, it is often assumed that spatially
separated components of a system thermalize with their immediate surroundings,
although the global state of the system is out of equilibrium. This powerful
assumption reduces the complexity of non-equilibrium systems to the local
application of well-founded equilibrium concepts. While this technique appears
to be consistent for the description of some phenomena, we show that it fails
for quantum friction by underestimating by approximately $80 \%$ the magnitude
of the drag force. Our results show that the correlations among components of
driven, but steady-state, quantum systems invalidate the assumption of local
thermal equilibrium, calling for a critical reexamination of this approach for
describing the physics of non-equilibrium systems.

  In this work, a computer code for forward calculation of H/V spectra based on
the diffuse field assumption (DFA) is presented and tested.It takes advantage
of the recently stated connection between the HVSRN and the elastodynamic
Green's function which arises from the ambient noise interferometry theory.
  The algorithm allows for (1) a natural calculation of the Green's functions
imaginary parts by using suitable contour integrals in the complex wavenumber
plane, and (2) separate calculation of the contributions of Rayleigh, Love,
P-SV and SH waves as well. The stability of the algorithm at high frequencies
is preserved by means of an adaptation of the Wang's orthonormalization method
to the calculation of dispersion curves, surface-waves medium responses and
contributions of body waves.
  This code has been combined with a variety of inversion methods to make up a
powerful tool for passive seismic surveying.

restrict the parameter space such that the lightest supersymmetric particle

unification (QYU) at the grand unification scale (M_GUT). QYU strictly requires
the ratios among the yukawa couplings as y_t/y_b ~ 1.2, y_tau/y_b ~ 1.4, and
y_t/y_tau ~ 0.8. We find that the need of fine-tuning over the fundamental
parameter space of QYU is in the acceptable range (Delta_EW <= 10^3), even if
the universal boundary conditions are imposed at M_ GUT, in contrast to CMSSM
and NUHM. UMSSM with the universal boundary conditions yields heavy stops
(m_{stop} >~ 2.5 TeV), gluinos (m_gluino >~ 2 TeV), and squarks from the first
two families (m_squarks >~ 4 TeV). Similarly the stau mass is bounded from
below at about 1.5 TeV. Despite this heavy spectrum, we find Delta_EW >~ 300,
which is much lower than that needed for the minimal supersymmetric models. In
addition, UMSSM yield relatively small mu-term, and the LSP neutralio is mostly
form by the Higgsinos of mass >~ 700 GeV. We obtain also bino-like dark matter
(DM) of mass about 400 GeV. Wino is usually found to be heavier than Higgsinos
and binos, but there is a small region where mu ~ M_1 ~ M_2 ~ 1 TeV. We also
identify chargino-neutralino coannihilation channel and A-resonance solutions
which reduce the relic abundance of LSP neutralino down to the ranges
compatible with the current WMAP measurements.

facial hair, etc.) and the clothes or accessories they wear (sunglasses, hat,
hoodies, etc.) is highly dependent on geo-location and weather condition,
respectively. This work explores, for the first time, the use of this
contextual information, as people with wearable cameras walk across different
neighborhoods of a city, in order to learn a rich feature representation for
facial attribute classification, without the costly manual annotation required
by previous methods. By tracking the faces of casual walkers on more than 40
hours of egocentric video, we are able to cover tens of thousands of different
identities and automatically extract nearly 5 million pairs of images connected
by or from different face tracks, along with their weather and location
context, under pose and lighting variations. These image pairs are then fed
into a deep network that preserves similarity of images connected by the same
track, in order to capture identity-related attribute features, and optimizes
for location and weather prediction to capture additional facial attribute
features. Finally, the network is fine-tuned with manually annotated samples.
We perform an extensive experimental analysis on wearable data and two standard
benchmark datasets based on web images (LFWA and CelebA). Our method
outperforms by a large margin a network trained from scratch. Moreover, even
without using manually annotated identity labels for pre-training as in
previous methods, our approach achieves results that are better than the state
of the art.

adopt a strategy that warrants the highest payoff. However, recent studies
indicate that the spatial selection for cooperation is enhanced if an
appropriate fraction of the population chooses the most common rather than the
most profitable strategy within the interaction range. Such conformity might be
due to herding instincts or crowd behavior in humans and social animals. In a
heterogeneous population where individuals differ in their degree, collective
influence, or other traits, an unanswered question remains who should conform.
Selecting conformists randomly is the simplest choice, but it is neither a
realistic nor the optimal one. We show that, regardless of the source of
heterogeneity and game parametrization, socially the most favorable outcomes
emerge if the masses conform. On the other hand, forcing leaders to conform
significantly hinders the constructive interplay between heterogeneity and
coordination, leading to evolutionary outcomes that are worse still than if
conformists were chosen randomly. We conclude that leaders must be able to
create a following for network reciprocity to be optimally augmented by
conformity. In the opposite case, when leaders are castrated and made to
follow, the failure of coordination impairs the evolution of cooperation.

of transformations among the Fields. These transformations are included in the
Master Equation by coupling them to Sources. Here we show that there are new
local SUSY Actions where the Chiral SUSY transformations are realized in terms
of transformations among both Fields and Sources. These Actions can be easily
obtained from the Chiral case by a very simple and local `Exchange
Transformation', which carries along all the interactions without difficulty.
For these new SUSY Actions, the SUSY charge does not exist in the relevant
sector, because Sources do not satisfy Equations of Motion.
  Nevertheless, the `Exchange Transformation' ensures that the new Master
Equation is true for the new Action. As a consequence, the Master Equation also
is true for the new 1PI Generating Functional. This implies that a `Suppressed
SUSY Charge' version of SUSY is still present. SUSY certainly becomes more
obscure and less constrained in this case. But it is still very restrictive.
  The new theories can be obtained from the old theories by using a special
technique, but it is not true that they are a sort of `broken version of
supersymmetry'. They are simply a new type of theory that is governed by
Supersymmetry, but without the use of Supercharges (except perhaps in some
sectors).
  In particular the number of physical Bosonic and Fermionic degrees of Freedom
are not equal for these new (sub)-Actions, although there is still
Boson/Fermion mass degeneracy in a (sub)-Action, so long as there is still a
Boson present. Notably, there is even a SUSY (sub)-Action where the physical
Scalars are not present, so that the (sub)-Action contains physical Fermions
only. In this theory the degeneracy of Bosonic and Fermionic masses is
obviously not present.

motivation is to determine whether there is any evidence of a suppression of
star-formation at high Eddington ratios, which may hint toward ""AGN feedback""
effects. Star-formation rates (SFRs) are derived from fits to Herschel-measured
far-infrared spectral energy distributions, taking into account any
contamination from the AGN. Herschel-undetected AGNs are included via stacking
analyses to provide average SFRs in bins of redshift and specific X-ray
luminosity (spanning $0.01 \lesssim L_{\rm X}/M_{\ast} \lesssim 100~L_{\odot}
~M_{\odot}^{-1}$). After normalising for the effects of mass and redshift
arising from the evolving galaxy main sequence, we find that the SFRs of high
specific luminosity AGNs are slightly enhanced compared to their lower specific
luminosity counterparts. This suggests that the SFR distribution of AGN hosts
changes with specific X-ray luminosity, a result reinforced by our finding of a
significantly higher fraction of starbursting hosts among high specific
luminosity AGNs compared to that of the general star-forming galaxy population
(i.e., 8-10 per cent vs. 3 per cent). Contrary to our original motivation, our
findings suggest that high specific luminosity AGNs are more likely to reside

expect the mass-ratio distribution of close companions ($a \lesssim 100$ AU) to
differ from that of wide companions. This prediction is difficult to test using
traditional methods, especially with intermediate-mass primary stars, for a
variety of observational reasons. We present the results of a survey searching

star-formation rates (sSFR) of galaxies and their mean surface mass densities,
{\Sigma}, as well as other aspects of their internal structure. These strong
correlations have often been taken to indicate that the internal structure of a
galaxy must play a major physical role, directly or indirectly, in the control
of star-formation. In this paper we show by means of a very simple toy model
that these correlations can arise naturally without any such physical role once
the observed evolution of the size-mass relation for star-forming galaxies is
taken into account. In particular, the model reproduces the sharp threshold in
{\Sigma} between galaxies that are star-forming and those that are quenched,
and the evolution of this threshold with redshift. Similarly, it produces
iso-quenched-fraction contours in the ${f_Q(m,R_e)}$ plane that are almost
exactly parallel to lines of constant {\Sigma} for centrals and shallower for
satellites. It does so without any dependence on quenching on size or {\Sigma},
and without invoking any differences between centrals and satellites, beyond
the different mass-dependences of their quenching laws. The toy-model also
reproduces several other observations, including the sSFR gradients within
galaxies and the appearance of inside-out build-up of passive galaxies.
Finally, it is shown that curvature in the Main Sequence sSFR-mass relation can
produce curvature in the apparent B/T ratios with mass. Our analysis therefore
suggests that many of the strong correlations that are observed between galaxy
structure and sSFR may well be a consequence of things unrelated to quenching
and should not be taken as evidence of the physical processes that drive
quenching.

observed at rest-frame energies above 2 keV, where the emission is expected to
be dominated by X-ray binary (XRB) populations; however, hot gas is expected to
provide small contributions to the observed- frame < 1 keV emission at $z < 1$.
We show that a single scaling relation between X-ray luminosity ($L_{\rm X}$)
and star-formation rate (SFR) is insufficient for characterizing the average
X-ray emission at all redshifts. We establish that scaling relations involving
not only SFR, but also stellar mass ($M_\star$) and redshift, provide
significantly improved characterizations of the average X-ray emission from
normal galaxy populations at $z \approx$ 0-7. We further provide the first
empirical constraints on the redshift evolution of X-ray emission from both
low-mass XRB (LMXB) and high-mass XRB (HMXB) populations and their scalings
with $M_\star$ and SFR, respectively. We find $L_{\rm 2-10 keV}({\rm
LMXB})/M_\star \propto (1 + z)^{2-3}$ and $L_{\rm 2-10 keV}({\rm HMXB})$/SFR
$\propto (1 + z)$, and show that these relations are consistent with XRB
population-synthesis model predictions, which attribute the increase in LMXB
and HMXB scaling relations with redshift as being due to declining host galaxy
stellar ages and metallicities, respectively. We discuss how emission from XRBs
could provide an important source of heating to the intergalactic medium in the
early Universe, exceeding that of active galactic nuclei.

sample consists of 352 objects brighter than $M_g=-9.13$ mag, the 50%
completeness limit of the survey. Using a Bayesian analysis, we find a best-fit
faint end slope of $\alpha=-1.33 \pm 0.02$ for the g-band luminosity function;
consistent results are found for the stellar mass function as well as the
luminosity function in the other four NGVS bandpasses. We discuss the
implications for the faint-end slope of adding 92 ultra compact dwarfs galaxies
(UCDs) -- previously compiled by the NGVS in this region -- to the galaxy
sample, assuming that UCDs are the stripped remnants of nucleated dwarf
galaxies. Under this assumption, the slope of the luminosity function (down to
the UCD faint magnitude limit, $M_g = -9.6$ mag) increases dramatically, up to
$\alpha = -1.60 \pm 0.06$ when correcting for the expected number of disrupted
non-nucleated galaxies. We also calculate the total number of UCDs and globular
clusters that may have been deposited in the core of Virgo due to the
disruption of satellites, both nucleated and non-nucleated. We estimate that
~150 objects with $M_g\lesssim-9.6$ mag and that are currently classified as
globular clusters, might, in fact, be the nuclei of disrupted galaxies. We
further estimate that as many as 40% of the (mostly blue) globular clusters in
the core of Virgo might once have belonged to such satellites; these same
disrupted satellites might have contributed ~40% of the total luminosity in
galaxies observed in the core region today. Finally, we use an updated Local
Group galaxy catalog to provide a new measurement of the luminosity function of
Local Group satellites, $\alpha=-1.21\pm0.05$.

one-parameter model extensions with respect to flat $\Lambda$CDM. We find a
clear preference for models with free curvature, $\Omega_\mathrm{K}$, or free
amplitude of the CMB lensing potential, $A_\mathrm{L}$. We also further develop
statistical tools to measure tension between datasets. We use a Gaussianization
scheme to compute tensions directly from the posterior samples using an
entropy-based method, the surprise, as well as a calibrated evidence ratio
presented here for the first time. We then proceed to investigate the
consistency between the base P15~CMB data and six other CMB and distance
datasets. In flat $\Lambda$CDM we find a $4.8\sigma$ tension between the base
P15~CMB data and a distance ladder measurement, whereas the former are
consistent with the other datasets. In the curved $\Lambda$CDM model we find
significant tensions in most of the cases, arising from the well-known low
power of the low-$\ell$ multipoles of the CMB data. In the flat $\Lambda$CDM
$+A_\mathrm{L}$ model, however, all datasets are consistent with the base
P15~CMB observations except for the CMB lensing measurement, which remains in
significant tension. This tension is driven by the increased power of the CMB
lensing potential derived from the base P15~CMB constraints in both models,
pointing at either potentially unresolved systematic effects or the need for
new physics beyond the standard flat $\Lambda$CDM model.

sequences, with more SiC condensing before amorphous carbon in metal-rich
stars, and the order reversed in metal-poor stars. MgS dust condenses in
optically thicker dust shells, and its condensation is delayed in more
metal-poor stars. Metal-poor carbon stars also tend to have stronger absorption
from C2H2 at 7.5 um. The relation between DPR and pulsation period shows
significant apparent scatter, which results from the initial mass of the star,
with more massive stars occupying a sequence parallel to lower-mass stars, but
shifted to longer periods. Accounting for differences in the mass distribution
between the carbon stars observed in the Small and Large Magellanic Clouds

to determine how Saturn's stratospheric thermal structure was disturbed by the
2010 Great White Spot. A study of Cassini Composite Infrared Spectrometer
(CIRS) spectra had already shown the presence of a large stratospheric
disturbance centered at a pressure of 2~hPa, nicknamed the beacon B0, and a
tail of warm air at lower pressures (Fletcher et al. 2012. Icarus 221,
560--586). Our observations confirm that the beacon B0 vertical structure
determined by CIRS, with a maximum temperature of $180\pm1$K at 2~hPa, is
overlain by a temperature decrease up to the 0.2-hPa pressure level. Our
retrieved maximum temperature of $180\pm1$K is colder than that derived by CIRS
($200\pm1$K), a difference that may be quantitatively explained by terrestrial
atmospheric smearing. We propose a scenario for the formation of the beacon
based on the saturation of gravity waves emitted by the GWS. Our observations
also reveal that the tail is a planet-encircling disturbance in Saturn's upper
stratosphere, oscillating between 0.2 and 0.02~hPa, showing a distinct
wavenumber-2 pattern. We propose that this pattern in the upper stratosphere is
either the signature of thermal tides generated by the presence of the warm

elements is employed to enhance their strength and ductility. Limited solid
solubility of these elements in steel leads to segregation during casting which
affects the entire down-stream processing and eventually the mechanical
properties of the finished product. Although it is thought that the presence of
continuous bands lead to premature failure, it has not been possible to verify
this link. This poses as increasingly greater risk for higher alloyed, higher
strength steels which are prone to centre-line segregation: it is thus vital to
be able to predict the mechanical behaviour of multi-phase (MP) steels under
loading.
  This review covers the microstructure and properties of galvanised advanced
high strength steels with particular emphasis to their use in automotive
applications. In order to understand the origins of banding, the origins of
segregation of alloying elements during casting and partitioning in the solid
state will be discussed along with the effects on the mechanical behaviour and
damage evolution under (tensile) loading. Attention will also be paid to the
application of microstructural models in tailoring the production process to
enable suppression of the effects of segregation upon banding. Finally, the
theory and application of the experimental techniques used in this work to
elucidate the structure and properties will be examined.

difficulties of each kind of variation: rotation in depth is by far the hardest
transformation to handle, followed by scale, then rotation in plane, and
finally position. This suggests that humans recognize objects mainly through 2D
template matching, rather than by constructing 3D object models, and that DCNNs
are not too unreasonable models of human feed-forward vision. Also, our results
show that the variation levels in rotation in depth and scale strongly modulate
both humans' and DCNNs' recognition performances. We thus argue that these
variations should be controlled in the image datasets used in vision research.

The TDDFT-based photoabsorption spectrum of C$_{60}$@C$_{240}$, calculated in a

the fullerenes which was proposed earlier. The calculated spectrum of the

controlled by stability selection integrated with the informative truncation.
To facilitate better convergence, we adopt an annealing strategy on the
truncation rate, which leads to a balanced trade-off between exploration and
exploitation in learning a sparse weight vector. Numerical experiments show
that our algorithm compares favorably with the original algorithm in terms of

one approach is to segment the task into sub-tasks with incremental rewards. We
propose a framework called Hierarchical Inverse Reinforcement Learning (HIRL),
which is a model for learning sub-task structure from demonstrations. HIRL
decomposes the task into sub-tasks based on transitions that are consistent
across demonstrations. These transitions are defined as changes in local
linearity w.r.t to a kernel function. Then, HIRL uses the inferred structure to
learn reward functions local to the sub-tasks but also handle any global
dependencies such as sequentiality.
  We have evaluated HIRL on several standard RL benchmarks: Parallel Parking
with noisy dynamics, Two-Link Pendulum, 2D Noisy Motion Planning, and a Pinball
environment. In the parallel parking task, we find that rewards constructed
with HIRL converge to a policy with an 80% success rate in 32% fewer time-steps
than those constructed with Maximum Entropy Inverse RL (MaxEnt IRL), and with
partial state observation, the policies learned with IRL fail to achieve this
accuracy while HIRL still converges. We further find that that the rewards
learned with HIRL are robust to environment noise where they can tolerate 1
stdev. of random perturbation in the poses in the environment obstacles while
maintaining roughly the same convergence rate. We find that HIRL rewards can
converge up-to 6x faster than rewards constructed with IRL.

the model size and to promote the model sparsity. Sparse models not only
improve computation and memory usage, but also enhance the generalization
capacity, a principle that concurs with the law of parsimony. However,
inappropriate sparsity modeling may also significantly degrade the performance.
In this paper, we propose Approximation Vector Machine (AVM), a model that can
simultaneously encourage the sparsity and safeguard its risk in compromising
the performance. When an incoming instance arrives, we approximate this
instance by one of its neighbors whose distance to it is less than a predefined
threshold. Our key intuition is that since the newly seen instance is expressed
by its nearby neighbor the optimal performance can be analytically formulated
and maintained. We develop theoretical foundations to support this intuition
and further establish an analysis to characterize the gap between the
approximation and optimal solutions. This gap crucially depends on the
frequency of approximation and the predefined threshold. We perform the
convergence analysis for a wide spectrum of loss functions including Hinge,
smooth Hinge, and Logistic for classification task, and $l_1$, $l_2$, and
$\epsilon$-insensitive for regression task. We conducted extensive experiments
for classification task in batch and online modes, and regression task in

norm of coherence is monotone under Maximally incoherent operation (MIO) and

Moreover, two different types of de-cohering power are defined and we find that
they are not equal in single qubit systems. Finally, we make a comparison

that the inter-nuclear potential is sufficiently attractive in the internal

channel (BC) with random fading and delayed CSIT, and identify the optimal
cache-aided degrees-of-freedom (DoF) performance within a factor of 4. The
achieved performance is due to a scheme that combines basic coded-caching with
MAT-type schemes, and which efficiently exploits the prospective-hindsight
similarities between these two methods. This delivers a powerful synergy
between coded caching and delayed feedback, in the sense that the total
synergistic DoF-gain can be much larger than the sum of the individual gains
from delayed CSIT and from coded caching.
  The derived performance interestingly reveals --- for the first time ---
substantial DoF gains from coded caching, even when the (normalized) cache size
$\gamma$ (fraction of the library stored at each receiving device) is very
small. Specifically, a microscopic $\gamma \approx e^{-G}$ can come within a
factor of $G$ from the interference-free optimal. For example, storing at each
device only a \emph{thousandth} of what is deemed as `popular' content
($\gamma\approx 10^{-3}$), we approach the interference-free optimal within a
factor of $ln(10^3) \approx 7$ (per user DoF of $1/7$), for any number of
users. This result carries an additional practical ramification as it reveals
how to use coded caching to essentially buffer CSI, thus partially ameliorating
the burden of having to acquire real-time CSIT.

a binary system was reported from the analysis of the microlensing event
OGLE-2013-BLG-0723. We reanalyze the event considering the possibility of other
interpretations. From this, we find a new solution where the lens is composed
of 2 bodies in contrast to the 3-body solution of the previous analysis. The
new solution better explains the observed light curve than the previous
solution with $\Delta\chi^2\sim 202$, suggesting that the new solution is a
correct model for the event. From the estimation of the physical parameters
based on the new interpretation, we find that the lens system is composed of
two low-mass stars with $\sim 0.2\ M_\odot$ and $\sim 0.1\ M_\odot$ and located
at a distance $\sim 3$ kpc. The fact that the physical parameters correspond to
those of the most common lens population located at a distance with a large
lensing probability further supports the likelihood of the new interpretation.
Considering that two dramatically different solutions can approximately explain
the observed light curve, the event suggests the need of carefully testing all
possible lens-system geometries.

delamination to impart a quantifiable local stain on thin films of homopolymer

the extent of asymptotic stability of the null solution for weakly coupled

the damping operator acts only on the first component and, whenever it is
bounded, the coupling is not strong enough to produce an exponential decay in
the energy space associated to the conservative part of the system. As a
consequence, for initial data in the energy space, the rate of decay is not
exponential. Due to the nature of the result it seems at first sight impossible
to obtain the asymptotic stability result by the classical Liapunov method.
Surprisingly enough, this turns out to be possible and we exhibit, under some
compatibility conditions on the operators, an explicit class of Liapunov
functions which allows to do 3 different things: 1) When the problem is reduced
to a stable finite dimensional space, we recover the exponential decay by a
single differential inequality and we estimate the logarithmic decrement of the
solutions with worst (slowest) decay. The estimate is optimal at least for some

east-west jet-alignment axis, and implying that the evolutionary processes of
both the jets and the SNR must be coupled. A separate RM-gradient is associated
with the termination shock in the Eastern ear, which we interpret as a
ring-like field located where the shock of the jet interacts with the
circumstellar medium. Future optical observations will be able to use the new
H$\alpha$ filaments to probe the kinematics of the shell of W50, potentially

which is valid for an arbitrary system-environment model in the weak

a quantum state that is subjected to repeated projective measurements depends
on the overlap of the spectral density of the environment and a generalized
`filter function' which in turn depends on the system state that is repeatedly
being prepared, the measurement interval, the system parameters, the
system-environment coupling, and the environment correlation function. This
general framework is then used to study explicitly the Zeno to anti-Zeno
crossover behavior for the spin-boson model where a single two-level system is
coupled to a bosonic environment. It is shown that our framework reproduces
results for the usual population decay case as well as for the pure dephasing
model, while at the same time allowing us to study the Zeno to anti-Zeno
transition when both decay and dephasing take place. These results are then
extended to many two-level systems coupled collectively to the bosonic
environment to show that the distinction between the Zeno and anti-Zeno effects
becomes more pronounced as the number of two-level systems increases.

access node serving legacy half-duplex mobile devices is studied and analyzed.
In particular, it is assumed that the access node is using the same center
frequency for all the transmissions, meaning that also the backhauling is done
using the same frequency resources as the uplink and downlink transmissions. It
is further assumed that the access node has a massive array to facilitate
efficient beamforming and self-interference nulling in its own receiver. As a
starting point, the signal model for the considered access node is first
derived, including all the transmitted and received signals within the cell.
This is then used as a basis for obtaining the sum-rate expressions, which
depict the overall rates experienced by the mobile users that are served by the
access node. In addition, the data rate for the bi-directional backhaul link is
also derived, since the access node must be able to backhaul itself wirelessly.
The maximum achievable sum-rate is then determined by numerically solving an
optimization problem constructed from the data rate expressions. The
full-duplex scheme is also compared to two alternative transmission schemes,
which perform all or some of the transmissions in half-duplex mode. The results
show that the full-duplex capability of the access node is beneficial for
maximizing the sum-rate, meaning that a simple half-duplex transmission scheme
is typically not optimal. In particular, the highest sum-rate is usually
provided by a relay type solution, where the access node acts as a full-duplex
relay between the mobiles and the backhaul node.

parity-propagation in their encoding process. The proposed codes provide a
systematic way of terminating a staircase code after an arbitrary number of

self-protection technique to avoid parity-propagation. We also introduce the
class of partial feed-forward staircase codes, which allows parity-propagation
to occur over a given number of blocks. By amortizing the complexity of
self-protection over several standard staircase blocks, the encoding complexity
of these codes is made comparable to staircase codes. Partial feed-forward
staircase codes have the same error-floor as staircase codes. Simulations
confirm that the performance of the proposed codes in both the waterfall and
error-floor regions is similar to the original staircase codes. The proposed
codes help extend the domain of application of staircase codes to systems in
which parity-propagation is undesirable or termination is necessary.

about mobility behavior. Since cell phone data can be captured in a passive way
for a large user population, they can be harnessed to collect well-sampled
mobility information. In this paper, we propose CT-Mapper, an unsupervised
algorithm that enables the mapping of mobile phone traces over a multimodal
transport network. One of the main strengths of CT-Mapper is its capability to
map noisy sparse cellular multimodal trajectories over a multilayer
transportation network where the layers have different physical properties and
not only to map trajectories associated with a single layer. Such a network is
modeled by a large multilayer graph in which the nodes correspond to
metro/train stations or road intersections and edges correspond to connections
between them. The mapping problem is modeled by an unsupervised HMM where the
observations correspond to sparse user mobile trajectories and the hidden
states to the multilayer graph nodes. The HMM is unsupervised as the transition
and emission probabilities are inferred using respectively the physical
transportation properties and the information on the spatial coverage of
antenna base stations. To evaluate CT-Mapper we collected cellular traces with
their corresponding GPS trajectories for a group of volunteer users in Paris
and vicinity (France). We show that CT-Mapper is able to accurately retrieve
the real cell phone user paths despite the sparsity of the observed trace
trajectories. Furthermore our transition probability model is up to 20% more
accurate than other naive models.

Gaussian measurement over a real single-input multiple-output (SIMO) additive
white Gaussian noise (AWGN) channel is studied with a low-resolution
analog-to-digital converter (ADC) front end. Joint optimization of the encoder
and the decoder mapping is tackled under both the mean squared error (MSE)
distortion and the distortion outage probability (DOP) criteria, with an
average power constraint on the channel input. Optimal encoder and decoder
mappings are identified for a one-bit ADC front end under both criteria. For
the MSE distortion, the optimal encoder mapping is shown to be non-linear in
general, while it tends to a linear encoder in the low signal-to-noise ratio
(SNR) regime, and to an antipodal digital encoder in the high SNR regime. This
is in contrast to the optimality of linear encoding at all SNR values in the
presence of a full-precision front end. For the DOP criterion, it is shown that
the optimal encoder mapping is piecewise constant and can take only two
opposite values when it is non-zero. For both the MSE distortion and the DOP
criteria, necessary optimality conditions are then derived for $K$-level ADC
front ends as well as front ends with multiple one-bit ADCs. These conditions
are used to obtain numerically optimized solutions. Extensive numerical results
are also provided in order to gain insights into the structure of the optimal

infrastructures so reliably and flexibly that users expect a high service

clouds only adopt novel ideas that are proven not to hinder established service
levels. To analyse their expected behaviour, new ideas are often evaluated with
simulators in production IaaS system-like scenarios. For instance, new research
could enable collaboration amongst several layers of schedulers or could
consider new optimisation objectives such as energy consumption. Unfortunately,
current cloud simulators are hard to employ and they often have performance
issues when several layers of schedulers interact in them. To target these
issues, a new IaaS simulation framework (called DISSECT-CF) was designed. The
new simulator's foundation has the following goals: easy extensibility, support
energy evaluation of IaaSs and to enable fast evaluation of many scheduling and
IaaS internal behaviour related scenarios. In response to the requirements of
such scenarios, the new simulator introduces concepts such as: a unified model
for resource sharing and a new energy metering framework with hierarchical and
indirect metering options. Then, the comparison of several simulated situations
to real-life IaaS behaviour is used to validate the simulator's functionality.
Finally, a performance comparison is presented between DISSECT-CF and some
currently available simulators.

spacetime four-volume $\tilde{T}$ (on-shell) of a finite patch of spacetime in
the context of Unimodular Loop Quantum Cosmology for the homogeneous and
isotropic model with flat spatial sections and without matter sources. Since
the spacetime four-volume is canonically conjugate to the cosmological
""constant"", the operator $\hat{T}$ is constructed by solving its canonical
commutation relation with $\hat{\Lambda}$ - the operator corresponding to the
classical cosmological constant on-shell $\tilde{\Lambda}$. This conjugacy,
along with the action of $\hat{T}$ on definite volume states reducing to
$\tilde{T}$, allows us to interpret that $\hat{T}$ is indeed a quantum
spacetime four-volume operator. The discrete spectrum of $\hat{T}$ is
calculated by considering the set of all $\tau$'s where the eigenvalue equation
has a solution $\Phi_{\tau}$ in the domain of $\hat{T}$. It turns out that,
upon assigning the maximal domain $D(\hat{T})$ to $\hat{T}$, we have
$\Phi_{\tau}\in D(\hat{T})$ for all $\tau\in\mathbb{C}$ so that the spectrum of
$\hat{T}$ is purely discrete and is the entire complex plane. A family of
operators $\hat{T}^{(b_0,\phi_0)}$ was also considered as possible self-adjoint
versions of $\hat{T}$. They represent the restrictions of $\hat{T}$ on their
respective domains $D(\hat{T}^{(b_0,\phi_0)})$ which are just the maximal
domain with additional quasi-periodic conditions. Their possible
self-adjointness is motivated by their discrete spectra only containing real
and discrete numbers $\tau_m$ for $m=0,\pm1,\pm2,...$.

estimate the positions of jumps in a piecewise constant signal perturbed by
additive noise. In this method, the $\ell_1$ norm penalizes sparsity of the
first-order derivative of the signal. Theoretical results, however, show that
in some situations, which can occur frequently in practice, even when the jump
amplitudes tend to $\infty$, the conventional method identifies false change
points. This issue is referred to as stair-casing problem and restricts
practical importance of $\ell_1$ mean filtering. In this paper, sparsity is
penalized more tightly than the $\ell_1$ norm by exploiting a certain class of
nonconvex functions, while the strict convexity of the consequent optimization
problem is preserved. This results in a higher performance in detecting change
points. To theoretically justify the performance improvements over $\ell_1$
mean filtering, deterministic and stochastic sufficient conditions for exact
change point recovery are derived. In particular, theoretical results show that
in the stair-casing problem, our approach might be able to exclude the false
change points, while $\ell_1$ mean filtering may fail. A number of numerical
simulations assist to show superiority of our method over $\ell_1$ mean
filtering and another state-of-the-art algorithm that promotes sparsity tighter
than the $\ell_1$ norm. Specifically, it is shown that our approach can
consistently detect change points when the jump amplitudes become sufficiently

NGC205) of the Andromeda galaxy are characterised by very different
interstellar medium (ISM) properties, which might suggest them being at
different galaxy evolutionary stages. While the dust content of NGC205 has been
studied in detail by De Looze et al. (2012), we present new Herschel dust
continuum observations of NGC147 and NGC185. The non-detection of NGC147 in
Herschel SPIRE maps puts a strong constraint on its dust mass (< 128 Msun). For
NGC185, we derive a total dust mass M_d = 5.1 x 10^3 Msun, which is a factor of
~2-3 higher than that derived from ISO and Spitzer observations and confirms
the need for longer wavelength observations to trace more massive cold dust
reservoirs. We, furthermore, estimate the dust production by asymptotic giant
branch (AGB) stars and supernovae (SNe). For NGC147, the upper limit on the
dust mass is consistent with expectations of the material injected by the
evolved stellar population. In NGC185 and NGC205, the observed dust content is
one order of magnitude higher compared to the estimated dust production by AGBs
and SNe. Efficient grain growth, and potentially longer dust survival times
(3-6 Gyr) are required to account for their current dust content. Our study
confirms the importance of grain growth in the gas phase to account for the
current dust reservoir in galaxies.

overdamped Langevin dynamics model of chemical reactions. We aim to give an
efficient description of typical transition paths in the small temperature
regime. We adopt a variational point of view and seek the best Gaussian
approximation, with respect to Kullback-Leibler divergence, of the non-Gaussian
distribution of the diffusion process. We interpret the mean of this Gaussian
approximation as the ""most likely path"" and the covariance operator as a means
to capture the typical fluctuations around this most likely path.
  We give an explicit expression for the Kullback-Leibler divergence in terms
of the mean and the covariance operator for a natural class of Gaussian
approximations and show the existence of minimisers for the variational
problem. Then the low temperature limit is studied via $\Gamma$-convergence of
the associated variational problem. The limiting functional consists of two
parts: The first part only depends on the mean and coincides with the
$\Gamma$-limit of the Freidlin-Wentzell rate functional. The second part
depends on both, the mean and the covariance operator and is minimized if the
dynamics are given by a time-inhomogenous Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process found by
linearization of the Langevin dynamics around the Freidlin-Wentzell minimizer.

show that white-noise given to potentials do not trigger modulation instability

white-noised potentials trigger modulation instability for tunneling of the

many apparent peaks. We argue that peaks of such a field may be in the form of
rational rogue wave solutions of the NLSE. Our results can be used to examine
the effects of noise on quantum tunneling. Since a rogue wavefunction means a
higher probability of the tunneling particle to be at a given (x,t) coordinate,

calculated for the first time, containing in general a non-zero lateral
component. While formally apparently a straightforward extension of existing
deep water theory, the introduction of finite water depth is physically
non-trivial, since the surface waves are now affected by a subtle interplay of
the effects of the current and the sea bed. This becomes particularly
pronounced when considering the phenomenon of critical velocity, the velocity
at which transversely propagating waves become unable to keep up with the
moving source. The phenomenon is well known for shallow water, and was recently
shown to exist also in deep water in the presence of a shear current
[Ellingsen, J.~Fluid Mech.\ {\bf 742} R2 (2014)]. We derive the exact criterion
for criticality as a function of an intrinsic shear Froude number $S\sqrt{b/g}$
($S$ is uniform vorticity, $b$ size of source), the water depth, and the angle
between the shear current and the ship's motion. Formulae for both the normal
and lateral wave resistance force are derived, and we analyse its dependence on
the source velocity (or Froude number $Fr$) for different amounts of shear and
different directions of motion. The effect of the shear current is to increase
wave resistance for upstream ship motion and decrease it for downstream motion.
Also the value of $Fr$ at which $R$ is maximal is lowered for upstream and
increased for downstream directions of ship motion. For oblique angles between
ship motion and current there is a lateral wave resistance component which can
amount to $10$-$20\%$ of the normal wave resistance for side-on shear and
$S\sqrt{b/g}$ of order unity. (Continues...)

independence, which essentially dictates that the collective judgment on one
issue should not depend on the individual judgments given on some other
issue(s) in the same agenda. Independence, although considered a desirable
property, is too strong, because together with mild additional conditions it
implies dictatorship. We propose here a weakening of independence, named agenda
separability: a judgment aggregation rule satisfies it if, whenever the agenda
is composed of several independent sub-agendas, the resulting collective
judgment sets can be computed separately for each sub-agenda and then put
together. We show that this property is discriminant, in the sense that among
judgment aggregation rules so far studied in the literature, some satisfy it
and some do not. We briefly discuss the implications of agenda separability on
the computation of judgment aggregation rules.

preconditioning on sparse recovery. Further, we formulate a convex optimization
problem for designing the preconditioner that yields a frame with improved
coherence. In addition to reducing coherence, we focus on designing well
conditioned frames and numerically study the relationship between the condition

general diagonal norm high-order summation-by-parts operators to a subcell
based high-order finite volume formulation. This equivalence enables the
construction of provably entropy stable schemes by a specific choice of the
subcell finite volume flux. We show that besides the construction of entropy
stable high order schemes, a careful choice of subcell finite volume fluxes
generates split formulations of quadratic or cubic terms. Thus, by changing the
subcell finite volume flux to a specific choice, we are able to generate, in a
systematic way, all common split forms of the compressible Euler advection
terms, such as the Ducros splitting and the Kennedy and Gruber splitting.
Although these split forms are not entropy stable, we present a systematic way
to prove which of those split forms are at least kinetic energy preserving.
With this, we show we construct a unified high-order split form DG framework.
We investigate with three dimensional numerical simulations of the inviscid
Taylor-Green vortex and show that the new split forms enhance the robustness of
high order simulations in comparison to the standard scheme when solving
turbulent vortex dominated flows. In fact, we show that for certain test cases,
the novel split form discontinuous Galerkin schemes are more robust than the
discontinuous Galerkin scheme with over-integration.

by adopting a special scheme comprising the Adams-Bashforth Temporal Fourier
Series method and the Runge-Kutta Temporal Special Finite-Difference method.
This numerical scheme transforms the governing equation for micropolar fluids
for this problem into system of finite-difference equations. This system was
further solved numerically by point SOR-method. These results were also further
extrapolated by the Richardson extrapolation method. This scheme is valid for
all values of the flow and fluid-parameters and for all time. Moreover the
boundary conditions of the vorticity and the spin at points far from the
cylinder are being imposed and encountered too. The results are compared with
existing results (for non-rotating circular cylinder in Newtonian fluids). The
comparison is good. The enhancement of lift and reduction in drag was observed
if the micropolarity effects are intensified. Same is happened if the rotation
of a cylinder increases. Furthermore, the vortex-pair in the wake is delayed to
successively higher times as rotation parameter increases. In addition, the
rotation helps not only in dissolving vortices adjacent to the cylinder and
adverse pressure region but also in dissolving the boundary layer separation.
Furthermore, the rotation reduces the micropolar spin boundary layer also.

interrupted with resetting to a given initial configuration after random time
intervals $\tau$ distributed as a power-law $\sim \tau^{-(1+\alpha)};~\alpha >

configuration, we show that depending on $\alpha$, the dynamics as $L \to
\infty$ exhibits a rich long-time behavior. Without resetting, the interface
width grows unbounded with time as $t^\beta$, where $\beta$ is the so-called
growth exponent. We show that introducing resetting induces for $\alpha>1$ and
at long times fluctuations that are bounded in time. Corresponding to such a
stationary state is a distribution of fluctuations that is strongly
non-Gaussian, with tails decaying as a power-law. The distribution exhibits a
cusp for small argument, implying that the stationary state is out of
equilibrium. For $\alpha<1$, resetting is unable to counter the otherwise
unbounded growth of fluctuations in time, so that the distribution of
fluctuations remains time dependent with an ever-increasing width even at long
times. Although stationary for $\alpha>1$, the width of the interface grows
forever with time as a power-law for $1<\alpha < \alpha^{({\rm w})}$, and
converges to a finite constant only for larger $\alpha$, thereby exhibiting a
crossover at $\alpha^{({\rm w})}=1+2\beta$. The time-dependent distribution of
fluctuations for $\alpha<1$ exhibits for small argument another interesting
crossover behavior, from cusp to divergence, across $\alpha^{({\rm
d})}=1-\beta$. We demonstrate these results by exact analytical results for the
paradigmatic Edwards-Wilkinson (EW) dynamical evolution of the interface, and
further corroborate our findings by extensive numerical simulations of

interbank exposures, these losses reverberate among banks and eventually get
amplified, with potentially catastrophic consequences for the whole financial

  ionization gas in the inner kiloparsec of NGC6240","Accepted for publication in ApSS",,"10.1007/s10509-016-2760-x",,"astro-ph.GA","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The understating of the origin of the H2 line emission from the central
regions of galaxies represent an important key to improve our knowledge about
the excitation and ionization conditions of the gas in these locations. Usually
these lines can be produced by Starburts, shocks and/or radiation from an
active galactic nucleus (AGN). Luminous Infrared Galaxies (LIRG) represent
ideal and challenging objects to investigate the origin of the H2 emission, as
all processes above can be observed in a single object. In this work, we use
K-band integral field spectroscopy to map the emission line flux distributions
and kinematics and investigate the origin of the molecular and ionized gas line
emission from inner 1.4x2.4 kpc2 of the LIRG NGC6240, known to be the galaxy
with strongest H2 line emission. The emission lines show complex profiles at
locations between both nuclei and surrounding the northern nucleus, while at
locations near the southern nucleus and at 1"" west of the northern nucleus,
they can be reproduced by a single gaussian component. We found that the H2
emission is originated mainly by thermal processes, possible being dominated by
heating of the gas by X-rays from the AGN at locations near both nuclei. For
the region between the northern and southern nuclei shocks due to the
interacting process may be the main excitation mechanism, as indicated by the
high values of the H2l2.12um/Brg line ratio. A contribution of fluorescent
excitation may also be important at locations near 1"" west of the northern
nucleus, which show the lowest line ratios. The [FeII]l2.072um/Brg ratio show a
similar trend as observed for H2l2.12um/Brg, suggesting that [FeII] and H2 line
emission have similar origins. Finally, the [CaVIII]l2.32um coronal line
emission is observed mainly in regions next to the nuclei, suggesting it is
originated gas ionized by the radiation from the AGN.

However, they may not be robust against outliers. Recently, the use of density
power weight has been studied for robust parameter estimation and the
corresponding divergences have been discussed. One of such divergences is the
$\gamma$-divergence and the robust estimator using the $\gamma$-divergence is
known for having a strong robustness. In this paper, we consider the robust and
sparse regression based on $\gamma$-divergence. We extend the
$\gamma$-divergence to the regression problem and show that it has a strong
robustness under heavy contamination even when outliers are heterogeneous. The
loss function is constructed by an empirical estimate of the
$\gamma$-divergence with sparse regularization and the parameter estimate is
defined as the minimizer of the loss function. To obtain the robust and sparse
estimate, we propose an efficient update algorithm which has a monotone
decreasing property of the loss function. Particularly, we discuss a linear
regression problem with $L_1$ regularization in detail. In numerical
experiments and real data analyses, we see that the proposed method outperforms
past robust and sparse methods.

We apply it to a simple Yukawa model with self-interaction showing how this has
a Nambu-Jona-Lasinio model and its higher order corrections as a low-energy

highly-ionising particles produced in high-energy collisions at the LHC. The
largely passive MoEDAL detector, deployed at Interaction Point 8 on the LHC
ring, relies on two dedicated direct detection techniques. The first technique
is based on stacks of nuclear-track detectors with surface area $\sim$18 m$^2$,
sensitive to particle ionisation exceeding a high threshold. These detectors
are analysed offline by optical scanning microscopes. The second technique is
based on the trapping of charged particles in an array of roughly 800 kg of
aluminium samples. These samples are monitored offline for the presence of
trapped magnetic charge at a remote superconducting magnetometer facility. We
present here the results of a search for magnetic monopoles using a 160 kg
prototype MoEDAL trapping detector exposed to 8 TeV proton-proton collisions at
the LHC, for an integrated luminosity of 0.75 fb$^{-1}$. No magnetic charge
exceeding $0.5g_{\rm D}$ (where $g_{\rm D}$ is the Dirac magnetic charge) is
measured in any of the exposed samples, allowing limits to be placed on
monopole production in the mass range 100 GeV$\leq m \leq$ 3500 GeV.
Model-independent cross-section limits are presented in fiducial regions of
monopole energy and direction for $1g_{\rm D}\leq|g|\leq 6g_{\rm D}$, and
model-dependent cross-section limits are obtained for Drell-Yan pair production
of spin-1/2 and spin-0 monopoles for $1g_{\rm D}\leq|g|\leq 4g_{\rm D}$. Under
the assumption of Drell-Yan cross sections, mass limits are derived for
$|g|=2g_{\rm D}$ and $|g|=3g_{\rm D}$ for the first time at the LHC, surpassing
the results from previous collider experiments.

shallow donor (most probable site is interstitial zinc for undoped ZnO) to such
newly formed shallow acceptor state creates new donor-acceptor pair (DAP)
luminescence peak ~ 3.229 eV. ABX and DAP peak energy positions confirm that
the acceptor is N related. The acceptor exciton binding energy has been
estimated to be 180 +/- 15 meV which is in conformity with earlier reports. The
activation of shallow acceptors without any source of atomic nitrogen can only
be possible through diffusion of molecular nitrogen inside the sample during
annealing. The N2 molecules get trapped at bulk defect sites incorporated by
ion irradiation and subsequent annealing. X-ray diffraction (XRD) and Raman
spectroscopic (RS) investigation have been employed to probe the changing
defective nature of the ZnO samples. Irradiation induced increased disorder has
been detected (both by XRD and RS) which is partially removed/modified by
annealing at 300 oC. Simultaneous activation of molecular nitrogen acceptor in
purposefully defective ZnO is the key finding of this work. Results presented
here provide a simple but controlled way of producing shallow acceptor state in

continuously, while the machine is operating, therefore requires continuous

that the charged $\rho$ condensation can exist in the temperature region of

suggests that high temperature superconductor might be created through

strategy of this work is to combine nonlinear segmentation with scales spaces

generalize a variational segmentation model based on total variation using
Bregman distances to construct an inverse scale space. This offers the new
model to be accomplished by a scale analysis approach based on a spectral

(nearly) parameter-free multiscale segmentation method that comes with an
adaptive regularization parameter choice. The added benefit of our method is
demonstrated by systematic synthetic tests and its usage in a new biomedical
toolbox for identifying and classifying circulating tumor cells. Due to the
nature of nonlinear diffusion underlying, the mathematical concepts in this
work offer promising extensions to nonlocal classification problems.

The detailed mechanism of superconductivity in this material is still the
subject of intense investigations. Since superconductivity is sensitive to the
topology of the Fermi surface (the contour of zero-energy quasi-particle
excitations in the momentum space in the normal state), changing this topology
can provide a strong test of theory. Recent experiments tuned the Fermi surface
topology efficiently by applying planar anisotropic strain. Using functional
renormalization group theory, we study the superconductivity and competing
orders in Sr$_2$RuO$_4$ under strain. We find a rapid initial increase in the
superconducting transition temperature $T_c$, which can be associated with the
evolution of the Fermi surface toward a Lifshitz reconstruction under
increasing strain. Before the Lifshitz reconstruction is reached, however, the
system switches from the superconducting state to a spin density wave state.
The theory agrees well with recent strain experiments showing an enhancement of
$T_c$ followed by an intriguing sudden drop.

on any difference in the parametrized post-Newtonian (PPN) parameter
$\Delta\gamma\lesssim 10^{-10}$. (2) The second is a comparison of GWs and

are five orders of magnitude stronger than those from PeV neutrinos in blazar

The third is a comparison of GWs with different frequencies in the range [35

weakly dependent on the surface ligand density and that the degree of water

linearly with depth. The surface velocity relative to the source is taken to be
zero, so that Doppler effects are absent. We solve the linearized Euler
equations to calculate the resulting wave field as well as its far-field
asymptotics. For values of the Froude number $F^2=\omega^2 D/g$ ($\omega$:
oscillation frequency, $D$ submergence depth) below a resonant value
$F^2_\text{res}$ the wave field splits cleanly into separate contributions from
regular dispersive propagating waves and non-dispersive ""critical waves""
resulting from a critical layer-like street of flow structures directly
downstream of the source. In the sub-resonant regime the regular waves behave
like sheared ring waves while the critical layer wave forms a street of a
constant width of order $D\sqrt{S/\omega}$ ($S$ is the shear flow vorticity)
and is convected downstream at the fluid velocity at the depth of the source.
When the Froude number approaches its resonant value, the the downstream
critical and regular waves resonate, producing a train of waves of linearly
increasing amplitude contained within a downstream wedge.

\k{o} is proportional to the electric field. The operator (1.1) was studied
both by physicists (see, e.g., the review [6]) and by mathematicians (see,
e.g., [9]). Its spectrum is absolutely continuous and fills the real axis. One
of main features of H \k{o} is the existence of Stark-Wannier ladders. These
are \k{o}-periodic sequences of resonances, which are poles of the analytic
continuation of the resolvent kernel in the lower half plane through the
spectrum (see, e.g., [2]). Most of the mathematical work studied the case of
small \k{o} (see, e.g., [9, 3] and references therein). When \k{o} is small,
there are ladders exponentially close to the real axis. Actually, only the case
of finite gap potentials v was relatively well understood. For these
potentials, there is only a finite number of ladders exponentially close to the
real axis. It was further noticed that the ladders non-trivially ""interact"" as
\k{o} changes, and conjectured that the behavior of the resonances strongly
depends on number theoretical properties of \k{o} (see, e.g., [1]). In the
present note, we only consider the periodic potential v(x) = 2 cos(2$\pi$x) and
study the reflection coefficient r(E) of the Stark-Wannier operator (1.1) in
the lower half of the complex plane of the spectral parameter E. The resonances
are the poles of the reflection coefficient. We show that, as Im E
$\rightarrow$ --$\infty$, the function E $\rightarrow$ 1 r(E) can be

Quicksort -- which is commonly considered as one of the fastest in-place
sorting algorithms -- suffers in an essential way from branch mispredictions.
We present a novel approach to address this problem by partially decoupling
control from data flow: in order to perform the partitioning, we split the
input in blocks of constant size (we propose 128 data elements); then, all
elements in one block are compared with the pivot and the outcomes of the
comparisons are stored in a buffer. In a second pass, the respective elements
are rearranged. By doing so, we avoid conditional branches based on outcomes of
comparisons at all (except for the final Insertionsort). Moreover, we prove
that for a static branch predictor the average total number of branch
mispredictions is at most $\epsilon n \log n + O(n)$ for some small $\epsilon$
depending on the block size when sorting $n$ elements.
  Our experimental results are promising: when sorting random integer data, we
achieve an increase in speed of 80% over the GCC implementation of C++
std::sort. Also for many other types of data and non-random inputs, there is
still a significant speedup over std::sort. Only in few special cases like
sorted or almost sorted inputs, std::sort can beat out implementation.
Moreover, even on random input permutations, our implementation is even
slightly faster than an implementation of the highly tuned Super Scalar Sample
Sort, which uses a linear amount of additional space.

the gravitational waves. Therefore, in this scenario some information about

  Analysis: A Continuous Double Auction Study","technical report, 37 pages",,,,"cs.AI cs.GT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Empirical game-theoretic analysis (EGTA) has recently been applied
successfully to analyze the behavior of large numbers of competing traders in a
continuous double auction market. Multiagent simulation methods like EGTA are
useful for studying complex strategic environments like a stock market, where
it is not feasible to solve analytically for the rational behavior of each
agent. A weakness of simulation-based methods in strategic settings, however,
is that it is typically impossible to prove that the strategy profile assigned
to the simulated agents is stable, as in a Nash equilibrium. I propose using
reinforcement learning to analyze the regret of supposed Nash-equilibrium
strategy profiles found by EGTA. I have developed a new library of
reinforcement learning tools, which I have integrated into an extended version
of the market simulator from our prior work. I provide evidence for the
effectiveness of our library methods, both on a suite of benchmark problems
from the literature, and on non-equilibrium strategy profiles in our market
environment. Finally, I use our new reinforcement learning tools to provide
evidence that the equilibria found by EGTA in our recent continuous double
auction study are likely to have only negligible regret, even with respect to
an extended strategy space.

the chemical compositions of the interstellar medium (gas/dust/ice) in regions
with distinct (molecular) gas densities that are exposed to radiation fields
with different intensities. We have significantly improved the Meijerink PDR
code by including 3050 new gas-phase chemical reactions and also by
implementing surface chemistry. In particular, we have included 117 chemical
reactions occurring on grain surfaces covering different processes, such as
adsorption, thermal desorption, chemical desorption, two-body reactions, photo
processes, and cosmic-ray processes on dust grains. We obtain abundances for
different gas and solid species as a function of visual extinction, depending
on the density and radiation field. We also analyse the rates of the formation
of CO2 and H2O ices in different environments. In addition, we study how
chemistry is affected by the presence/absence of ice mantles (bare dust or icy
dust) and the impact of considering different desorption probabilities. The
type of substrate (bare dust or icy dust) and the probability of desorption can
significantly alter the chemistry occurring on grain surfaces, leading to
differences of several orders of magnitude in the abundances of gas-phase
species, such as CO, H2CO, and CH3OH. The type of substrate, together with the
density and intensity of the radiation field, also determine the threshold
extinction to form ices of CO2 and H2O. We also conclude that H2CO and CH3OH
are mainly released into the gas phase of low, far-ultraviolet illuminated PDRs
through chemical desorption upon two-body surface reactions, rather than
through photodesorption.

  between two point charges and two conductive spheres of equal radii",,,,,"cond-mat.soft","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The Coulomb's formula for the force FC of electrostatic interaction between
two point charges is well known. In reality, however, interactions occur not
between point charges, but between charged bodies of certain geometric form,
size and physical structure. This leads to deviation of the estimated force FC
from the real force F of electrostatic interaction, thus imposing the task to
evaluate the disparity. In the present paper the problem is being solved
theoretically for two charged conductive spheres of equal radii and arbitrary
electric charges. Assessment of the deviation is given as a function of the
ratio of the distance R between the spheres centers to the sum of their radii.
For the purpose, relations between FC and F derived in a preceding work of
ours, are employed to generalize the Coulomb's interactions. At relatively
short distances between the spheres, the Coulomb force FC, as estimated to be
induced by charges situated at the centers of the spheres, differ significantly
from the real force F of interaction between the spheres. In the case of zero
and non-zero charge we prove that with increasing the distance between the two
spheres, the force F decrease rapidly, virtually to zero values, i.e. it
appears to be short-acting force.

for instance in seismic velocity analysis, data interpolation and for multiple
removal. A direct implementation by summation of traces with different moveouts
is computationally expensive for large data sets. In this paper we present a
new method for fast computation of the hyperbolic Radon transforms. It is based
on using a log-polar sampling with which the main computational parts reduce to
computing convolutions. This allows for fast implementations by means of FFT.
In addition to the FFT operations, interpolation procedures are required for
switching between coordinates in the time-offset; Radon; and log-polar domains.
Graphical Processor Units (GPUs) are suitable to use as a computational
platform for this purpose, due to the hardware supported interpolation routines
as well as optimized routines for FFT. Performance tests show large speed-ups
of the proposed algorithm. Hence, it is suitable to use in iterative methods,
and we provide examples for data interpolation and multiple removal using this
approach.

photochromic glassy liquid crystal (LC) polymers under polarized ultraviolet
light (PUV) is studied. Trans-cis photo-isomerization is generally known to be
most intense at 'parallel illumination' (polarization parallel to LC director),
as light-medium interactions are active when polarization aligns with
trainsition dipole moment. We show that at parallel illumination though cis
isomers are converted from trans the most near surface, they can be the least
below certain light propagation depth. Membrane force, an average effect of
trans-cis conversion over propagation depths, shows a monotonic polarization
dependence, i.e. maximum at parallel illumination, which agrees well with
experiment [1]. However, under strong illumination, cis
fraction/photo-contraction distribution through depths shows deep penetration,
switching over the polarization dependence in photo-moment, which is related to
photo-contraction gradient ---- photo-moment can be maximum at 'perpendicular
illumination' (polarization perpendicular to director) under strong light. We
give both intuitive explanation and analytical demonstration in thin strip
limit for the switchover.
