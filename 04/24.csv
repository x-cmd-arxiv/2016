N-terminal protein domain of the human transcription factor XPB. The results
are very significant as NTD-hXPB plays a critical role in the synthesis of
proteins (specifically transcription) and DNA damage repair (specifically
nucleotide excision repair). NTD-hXPB is directly implicated in rare diseases
XP-B, XP-CS, and TTD2, whose symptoms include neurodegenerative disorders,
premature aging, and decreased fertility. NTDhXPB is also linked to anti-cancer
therapies. As a bi-product we derived 3D models of NTD-mXPB - homologue of
NTD-hXPB in mycobacterium tuberculosis aka MTB (causative agent of most cases
of tuberculosis, which surpassed HIV as #1 infectious disease killer in 2014).
These could be potential target for TB therapeutics. Our ab-initio modelling
protocol takes advantage of recent powerful advances (prediction of contact
residues) in protein structure modeling. Our protocol also includes human in
the loop, inspired by the prevailing theory that computational abilities of
human minds can be powerfully harnessed in engineering/problem-solving. Using
the developed models in this paper, we are able to propose significant insights
into (a) the role of NTD-hXPB in the process of transcription and DNA damage
repair (specifically NER), (b) the critical interactions of NTD-hXPB with
another co-labourer protein p52, (c) diseases associated with NTD-hXPB, and (d)
alterations in functionalities between NTD-hXPB (in human) and NTD-mXPB (in TB

dictionary learning (DL) and sparse coding (SC) on a statistical manifold (the
manifold of probability distributions). Unlike the traditional DL and SC
framework, our new formulation {\it does not explicitly incorporate any
sparsity inducing norm in the cost function but yet yields SCs}. Moreover, we
extend this framework to the manifold of symmetric positive definite matrices,
$\mathcal{P}_n$. Our algorithm approximates the data points, which are
probability distributions, by the weighted Kullback-Leibeler center (KL-center)
of the dictionary atoms. The KL-center is the minimizer of the maximum
KL-divergence between the unknown center and members of the set whose center is
being sought. Further, {\it we proved that this KL-center is a sparse
combination of the dictionary atoms}. Since, the data reside on a statistical
manifold, the data fidelity term can not be as simple as in the case of the
vector-space data. We therefore employ the geodesic distance between the data
and a sparse approximation of the data element. This cost function is minimized
using an acceleterated gradient descent algorithm. An extensive set of
experimental results show the effectiveness of our proposed framework. We
present several experiments involving a variety of classification problems in
Computer Vision applications. Further, we demonstrate the performance of our
algorithm by comparing it to several state-of-the-art methods both in terms of
classification accuracy and sparsity.

are subsampled at a rate significantly lower than required by the
Nyquist-Shannon sampling theorem. Our proposed framework uses arbitrary
multiscale transforms, such as those build upon wavelets or shearlets, as a
sparsity promoting prior which allow to decompose the image into different
scales such that image features can be optimally extracted. In order to further
exploit the sparsity of the recovered signal we combine the method of
reweighted $\ell^1$, introduced by Cand\`es et al., with iteratively updated
weights accounting for the multilevel structure of the signal. This is done by
directly incorporating this approach into a split Bregman based algorithmic
framework. Furthermore, we add total generalized variation (TGV) as a second
regularizer into the split Bregman algorithm. The resulting algorithm is then
applied to a classical and widely considered task in signal- and image
processing which is the reconstruction of images from their Fourier
measurements. Our numerical experiments show a highly improved performance at
relatively low computational costs compared to many other well established
methods and strongly suggest that sparsity is better exploited by our method.

atomic-scale hard sphere solutes in water. Secondly, inclusion of attractive
interactions associated with atomic-size hydrophobic reference cases leads to
substantial, non-trivial corrections to reference results for purely repulsive

consumption in the United States. Improving their energy efficiency contributes
to the sustainability of global energy systems and the supermarket business

consumption of multi-case supermarket refrigerators by explicitly taking into
account their interconnected and switched system dynamics. Its novelty is a
bilevel combinatorial optimization formulation to generate ON/OFF control
actions for expansion valves and compressors. The inner optimization module
keeps display case temperatures in a desirable range and the outer optimization
module minimizes energy consumption. In addition to its energy-saving
capability, the proposed controller significantly reduces the frequency of
compressor switchings by employing a conservative compressor control strategy.
However, solving this bilevel optimization problem associated with
interconnected and switched systems is a computationally challenging task. To
solve the problem in near real time, we propose two approximation algorithms
that can solve both the inner and outer optimization problems at once. The
first algorithm uses a linear approximation, and the second is based on the
submodular structure of the optimization problem. Both are (polynomial-time)
scalable algorithms and generate near-optimal solutions with performance
guarantees. Our work complements existing optimization-based control methods
(e.g., MPC) for supermarket refrigerators, as our algorithms can be adopted as
a tool for solving combinatorial optimization problems arising in these

predict abundance structures that differ from the empirical abundance maps
derived with (Zeeman) Doppler mapping (ZDM). Whereas both equilibrium abundance
stratification calculations and stationary solutions to the time-dependent
diffusion equations predict (warped) rings about the magnetic equator in
dipole-like magnetic geometries, spot-like structures dominate published maps.
An in-depth analysis of this apparent disagreement investigates the
detectability by means of ZDM of a variety of abundance structures, including
(warped) rings predicted by theory, but also some complex spot-like structures.
As it turns out, a number of published maps have to be considered spurious
either because strong magnetic fields have been neglected or because they are
based on spectra where photon noise dominates over the signal of the alleged
abundance structures. Even when spectra of high signal to noise ratio are
available, it can prove altogether impossible to correctly recover shapes,
positions and abundances of a mere handful of spots, even using all 4 Stokes
parameters and knowing the field geometry, the recovery of (warped) rings can
be equally challenging. Inversions -- based on just one or two spectral lines
-- of complex abundance maps usually admit of multiple solutions. It turns out
that there is no guarantee that a properly chosen regularisation function will
lead to the true abundance map. Attention is drawn to the need for a study that
would elucidate the relation between the stratified, field-dependent abundance
structures predicted by diffusion theory and empirical maps obtained by means
of ""canonical"" ZDM, i.e. with mean atmospheres and unstratified abundances.

developers keep making this seemingly simple mistake. Specifically, we design
and implement BinderCracker, an automatic testing framework that supports
parameter-aware fuzzing and has identified more than 100 vulnerabilities in six
major versions of Android, including the latest version Android 6.0,
Marshmallow. Some of the vulnerabilities have severe security implications,
causing privileged code execution or permanent Denial-of-Service (DoS). We
analyzed the root causes of these vulnerabilities to find that most of them
exist because system service developers only considered exploitations via
public APIs. We thus highlight the deficiency of testing only on client-side
public APIs and argue for the necessity of testing and protection on the Binder
interface - the actual security boundary. Specifically, we discuss the
effectiveness and practicality of potential countermeasures, such as
precautionary testing and runtime diagnostic.

Compared to other single photon imaging techniques like epifluorescence and

SPIM has the potential to provide deep imaging in scattering media in
situations where 2PM systems would be too large or costly.

propositions of a quantum mechanical system represented by the Hilbert space,
and by Gleason's theorem atoms of this orthomodular lattice correspond to pure
states of the system. Wigner's theorem says that the automorphism group of this
orthomodular lattice corresponds to the group of unitary and anti-unitary
operators of the Hilbert space. This result is of basic importance in the use
of group representations in quantum mechanics.
  The closed subspaces $A$ of a Hilbert space $\mathcal{H}$ correspond to
direct product decompositions $\mathcal{H}\simeq A\times A^\perp$ of the
Hilbert space, a result that lies at the heart of the superposition principle.
It has been shown that the direct product decompositions of any set, group,
vector space, and topological space form an orthomodular poset. This is the
basis for a line of study in foundational quantum mechanics replacing Hilbert
spaces with other types of structures. It is the purpose of this note to prove
a version of Wigner's theorem: for an infinite set $X$, the automorphism group
of the orthomodular poset Fact $(X)$ of direct product decompositions of $X$ is
isomorphic to the permutation group of $X$.
  The structure Fact $(X)$ plays the role for direct product decompositions of
a set that the lattice of equivalence relations plays for surjective images of
a set. So determining its automorphism group is of interest independent of its
application to quantum mechanics. Other properties of Fact $(X)$ are determined
in proving our version of Wigner's theorem, namely that Fact $(X)$ is atomistic

economy. We introduce three measures of negativity concerning the
representations of quantum states, unitary transformations, and quantum

representations with minimal negativity, which are in one-to-one correspondence
with the elusive symmetric informationally complete measurements. In addition,
most representations with minimal negativity are automatically covariant with

arising for the critical planar Ising model on a domain with + boundary
conditions, and show that it converges towards CLE(3).
  Our proof relies on the study of the coupling between the Ising model and its
random cluster (FK) representation, and of the interactions between FK and
Ising interfaces. The main idea is to construct an exploration process starting
from the boundary of the domain, to discover the Ising loops and to establish
its convergence to a conformally invariant limit. The challenge is that Ising
loops do not touch the boundary; we use the fact that FK loops touch the
boundary (and hence can be explored from the boundary) and that Ising loops in
turn touch FK loops, to construct a recursive exploration process that visits
all the macroscopic loops.
  A key ingredient in the proof is the convergence of Ising free arcs to the
Free Arc Ensemble (FAE), established in [BDH16]. Qualitative estimates about
the Ising interfaces then allow one to identify the scaling limit of Ising
loops as a conformally invariant collection of simple, disjoint SLE(3)-like
loops and thus by the Markovian characterization of [ShWe12] as a CLE(3).
  A technical point of independent interest contained in this paper is an
investigation of double points of interfaces in the scaling limit of critical
FK-Ising. It relies on the technology of [KeSm12].

Boltzmann and Landau operators in weighted Sobolev spaces and in anisotropic
spaces. All the sharp bounds are given for the original Boltzmann and Landau
operators. The sharpness means the lower and upper bounds for the operators are
consistent with the behavior of the linearized operators. Moreover, we make
clear the difference between the bounds for the original operators and those
for the linearized ones.
  According to the Bobylev's formula, we introduce two types of dyadic
decompositions performed in both phase and frequency spaces to make full use of
the interaction and the cancellation. It allows us to see clearly which part of
the operator behaves like a Laplace type operator and which part is dominated
by the anisotropic structure. It is the key point to get the sharp bounds in
weighted Sobolev spaces and in anisotropic spaces. Based on the geometric
structure of the elastic collision, we make a geometric decomposition to
capture the anisotropic structure of the collision operator. More precisely, we
make it explicit that the fractional Laplace-Beltrami operator really exists in
the structure of the collision operator. It enables us to derive the sharp
bounds in anisotropic spaces and then complete the entropy dissipation
estimates. The structures mentioned above are so stable that we can apply them
to the rescaled Boltzmann collision operator in the process of the grazing
collisions limit. Then we get the sharp bounds for the Landau collision
operator by passing to the limit. We remark that our analysis used here will

tool for Nearest Neighbor(s) search in high dimensional spaces. However,
traditional LSH systems cannot be applied in online big data systems to handle
a large volume of query/update requests, because most of the systems optimize
the query efficiency with the assumption of infrequent updates and missing the
parallel-friendly design. As a result, the state-of-the-art LSH systems cannot

query/update requests in RAM and scales the system capacity by using flash
memory. To achieve high streaming data throughput, PFO adopts a
parallel-friendly indexing structure while preserving the distance between data
points. Further, it accommodates inbound data in real-time and dispatches
update requests intelligently to eliminate the cross-threads synchronization.
We carried out extensive evaluations with large synthetic and standard

conjectured that the splay tree is dynamically optimal binary search tree
(BST). In spite of decades of intensive research, the problem remains open.
Perhaps a more basic question, which has also attracted much attention, is if
there exists any dynamically optimal BST algorithm. One such candidate is
GREEDY which is a simple and intuitive BST algorithm [Lucas, Rutgers Tech.
Report, 1988; Munro, ESA, 2000; Demaine, Harmon, Iacono, Kane and Patrascu,
SODA, 2009]. [Demaine et al., SODA, 2009] showed a novel connection between a
geometric problem.
  Since dynamic optimality conjecture in its most general form remains elusive
despite much effort, researchers have studied this problem on special
sequences. Recently, [Chalermsook, Goswami, Kozma, Mehlhorn and Saranurak,
FOCS, 2015] studied a type of sequences known as $k$-{\em decomposable
sequences} in this context, where $k$ parametrizes easiness of the sequence.
Using tools from forbidden submatrix theory, they showed that GREEDY takes
$n2^{O(k^2)}$ time on this sequence and explicitly raised the question of
improving this bound.
  In this paper, we show that GREEDY takes $O(n \log{k})$ time on
$k$-decomposable sequences. In contrast to the previous approach, ours is based
on first principles. One of the main ingredients of our result is a new
construction of a lower bound certificate on the performance of any algorithm.
This certificate is constructed using the execution of GREEDY, and is more
nuanced and possibly more flexible than the previous independent set
certificate of Demaine et al. This result, which is applicable to all
sequences, may be of independent interest and may lead to further progress in
analyzing GREEDY on $k$-decomposable as well as general sequences.

\oplus g)(x,y) = f(x) + g(y), x = (x_0,...,x_m), y = (y_0,...,y_n)$. We prove
algebraic variants and generalizations of this result in \'etale cohomology
over fields of any characteristic, where the tensor product is replaced by a
certain local convolution product, as suggested by Deligne. They generalize
arXiv:1105.5210. The main ingredient is a K\""unneth formula for $R\Psi$ in the
framework of Deligne's theory of nearby cycles over general bases. In the last
section, we study the tame case, and the relations between tensor and
convolution products, in both global and local situations.

  Among results of this paper are the following.
  1. Total resonance index satisfies Robbin-Salamon axioms for spectral flow.
  2. Direct proof of equality ""total resonance index = intersection number"".
  3. Direct proof of equality ""total resonance index = total Fredholm index"".
  4. (a) Criteria for a perturbation~$V$ to be tangent to the~resonance set at
a point~$H,$ where the resonance set is the infinite-dimensional variety of
self-adjoint perturbations of the initial self-adjoint operator~$H_0$ which
have~$\lambda$ as an eigenvalue. (b) Criteria for the order of tangency of a

The torsional
rigidity of an open set $\Omega \subset T^m$ is the integral with respect to
Lebesgue measure over all starting points $x \in \Omega$ of the expected
lifetime in $\Omega$ of a Brownian motion starting at $x$. In this paper we
consider $\Omega = T^m \backslash \beta[0,t]$, the complement of the path
$\beta[0,t]$ of an independent Brownian motion up to time $t$. We compute the
leading order asymptotic behaviour of the expectation of the torsional rigidity
in the limit as $t \to \infty$. For $m=2$ the main contribution comes from the
components in $T^2 \backslash \beta [0,t]$ whose inradius is comparable to the
largest inradius, while for $m=3$ most of $T^3 \backslash \beta [0,t]$
contributes. A similar result holds for $m \geq 4$ after the Brownian path is
replaced by a shrinking Wiener sausage $W_{r(t)}[0,t]$ of radius
$r(t)=o(t^{-1/(m-2)})$, provided the shrinking is slow enough to ensure that
the torsional rigidity tends to zero. Asymptotic properties of the capacity of
$\beta[0,t]$ in $R^3$ and $W_1[0,t]$ in $R^m$, $m \geq 4$, play a central role
throughout the paper. Our results contribute to a better understanding of the
geometry of the complement of Brownian motion on $T^m$, which has received a

single peak for open-shell nuclei and the Coulomb exchange term is very
important to predict the IAS energies. For the GTR, the isovector pairing can
increase the calculated GTR energy, while the isoscalar pairing has an
important influence on the low-lying tail of the GT transition. Furthermore,
the QRPA approach is employed to predict nuclear $\beta$-decay half-lives. With
an isospin-dependent pairing interaction in the isoscalar channel, the
RHFB+QRPA approach almost completely reproduces the experimental $\beta$-decay
half-lives for nuclei up to the Sn isotopes with half-lives smaller than one

  Beta-Reduction",,,,,"cs.LO","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Performing $n$ steps of $\beta$-reduction to a given term in the
$\lambda$-calculus can lead to an increase in the size of the resulting term
that is exponential in $n$. The same is true for the possible depth increase of
terms along a $\beta$-reduction sequence. We explain that the situation is
different for the leftmost-outermost strategy for $\beta$-reduction: while
exponential size increase is still possible, depth increase is bounded linearly
in the number of steps. For every $\lambda$-term $M$ with depth $d$, in every
step of a leftmost-outermost $\beta$-reduction rewrite sequence starting from
$M$ the term depth increases by at most $d$. Hence the depth of the $n$-th
reduct of $M$ in such a rewrite sequence is bounded by $d\cdot (n+1)$.
  We prove the lifting of this result to $\lambda$-term representations as
orthogonal first-order term rewriting systems, which can be obtained by the
lambda-lifting transformation. For the transfer to lambda-calculus, we rely on
correspondence statements via lambda-lifting. We argue that the
linear-depth-increase property can be a stepping stone for an alternative proof
of, and so can shed new light on, a result by Accattoli and Dal Lago (2015)
that states: leftmost-outermost $\beta$-reduction rewrite sequences of length
$n$ in the lambda-calculus can be implemented on a reasonable machine with an
overhead that is polynomial in $n$ and the size of the initial term.

stragglers (BSs) in evolving globular clusters, based on numerical simulations
done with the MOCCA code for various initial globular clusters conditions.
  We find that various populations of BSs strongly depend on the initial
semi-major axes distributions. With a significant number of compact binaries,
the number of evolutionary BSs can be also significant. In turn, for semi-major
axes distributions preferring binaries with wider orbits, dynamical BSs are the
dominant ones. Their formation scenario is very distinct: for wide binaries the
number of dynamical interactions is significantly larger. Most interactions are
weak and increase only slightly the eccentricities. However, due to a large
number of such interactions, the eccentricities of a number of binaries finally
get so large that the stars collide.
  We study how larger initial clusters' concentrations influence the BSs.
Besides the expected increase of the number of dynamically created BSs (for
denser GCs the probabilities of strong dynamical interactions and collisions
are higher), we find that the number of the evolutionary BSs is not affected
even by very high initial concentrations. This has a very important implication
on observations - it supports the theory that the evolutionary BSs are the
result of the unperturbed evolution of the primordial binaries.
  In addition, the paper presents the evolution of the ratio between the number
of BSs in binaries and as single stars R_B/S. For a vast diversity of models,
the ratio R_B/S approaches the value ~0.4. Additionally, we identified two
subgroups which differ in the initial semi-major axes distributions. The first
group starts with a high ratio R_B/S, it decreases with time and settles around
0.4. The second group starts with lower values of the ratio R_B/S ... . (etc.,

graph theory. We consider this problem in the setting of local algorithms: one
wants to quickly determine whether a given edge $e$ is in a specific spanning
tree, without computing the whole spanning tree, but rather by inspecting the
local neighborhood of $e$. The challenge is to maintain consistency. That is,
to answer queries about different edges according to the same spanning tree.
Since it is known that this problem cannot be solved without essentially
viewing all the graph, we consider the relaxed version of finding a spanning
subgraph with $(1+\epsilon)n$ edges (where $n$ is the number of vertices and
$\epsilon$ is a given sparsity parameter). It is known that this relaxed
problem requires inspecting $\Omega(\sqrt{n})$ edges in general graphs, which
motivates the study of natural restricted families of graphs. One such family
is the family of graphs with an excluded minor. For this family there is an
algorithm that achieves constant success probability, and inspects
$(d/\epsilon)^{poly(h)\log(1/\epsilon)}$ edges (for each edge it is queried
on), where $d$ is the maximum degree in the graph and $h$ is the size of the
excluded minor. The distances between pairs of vertices in the spanning
subgraph $G'$ are at most a factor of $poly(d, 1/\epsilon, h)$ larger than in
$G$.
  In this work, we show that for an input graph that is $H$-minor free for any
$H$ of size $h$, this task can be performed by inspecting only $poly(d,
1/\epsilon, h)$ edges. The distances between pairs of vertices in the spanning
subgraph $G'$ are at most a factor of $\tilde{O}(h\log(d)/\epsilon)$ larger
than in $G$. Furthermore, the error probability of the new algorithm is
significantly improved to $\Theta(1/n)$. This algorithm can also be easily
adapted to yield an efficient algorithm for the distributed setting.

saturation property of symmetric nuclear matter as well as neutron-star matter.
A recently proposed unique scenario of extracting the saturation property of
nuclear matter and stiffness of neutron stars through the analysis of
nucleus-nucleus elastic scattering in laboratories is presented in some detail.

that images its interior onto the horizon. Being diffraction limited the ""Airy
hyper-ball"" that forms as a result of interference of gravitational waves, does
not allow for infinite resolution. Thereby, effectively censoring the geodetic
singularity. The mechanism proposed must imply intrinsic angular momentum as in
the Kerr black hole solution. However, assuming that a static black hole
develops from an initial Kerr solution the destroyed hyperball is delegated to
the horizon by the principle of increasing entropy. This lost information about
the system resolution is now packed on the horizon, which in effect provides
the censorship. Should the mechanism be applicable to the early universe, we
suggest that the low variance circles seen in the CMB sky are traces of such an
interference pattern.

galaxy clusters. A case is made for a generalized gravitational theory called
Scalar-Tensor-Vector-Gravity (STVG) or MOG (modified gravity) to explain
merging cluster dynamics. The paper presents the results of a re-analysis of
the Bullet Cluster, as well as an analysis of the Train Wreck Cluster in the
weak gravitational field limit without dark matter. The King-$\beta$ model is
used to fit the X-ray data of both clusters, and the $\kappa$-maps are computed
using the parameters of this fit. The amount of galaxies in the clusters is
estimated by subtracting the predicted $\kappa$-map from the $\kappa$-map data.
The estimate for the Bullet Cluster is that $14.1\%$ of the cluster is composed
of galaxies. For the Train Wreck Cluster, if the Jee et al. data are used,
$25.7\%$ of the cluster is composed of galaxies. The baryon matter in the
galaxies and the enhanced strength of gravitation in MOG, shift the lensing
peaks making them offset from the gas. The work demonstrates that this
generalized gravitational theory can explain merging cluster dynamics without
dark matter.
