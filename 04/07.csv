Specifically, we propose a variant Hotelling model where companies and
customers are represented by points in an Euclidean space, with axes being
product features. $N$ companies compete to maximize their own profits by
optimally choosing their prices, while each customer in the market, when
choosing sellers, considers the sum of product price, discrepancy between
product feature and his preference, and a company's brand name, which is
modeled by a function of its market area of the form $-\beta\cdot\text{(Market
Area)}^q$, where $\beta$ captures the brand influence and $q$ captures how
market share affects the brand. By varying the parameters $\beta$ and $q$, we
derive existence results of Nash equilibrium and equilibrium market prices and
shares. In particular, we prove that pure Nash equilibrium always exists when
$q=0$ for markets with either one and two dominating features, and it always
exists in a single dominating feature market when market affects brand name
linearly, i.e., $q=1$. Moreover, we show that at equilibrium, a company's price
is proportional to its market area over the competition intensity with its
neighbors, a result that quantitatively reconciles the common belief of a
company's pricing power. We also study an interesting ""wipe out"" phenomenon
that only appears when $q>0$, which is similar to the ""undercut"" phenomenon in
the Hotelling model, where companies may suddenly lose the entire market area
with a small price increment. Our results offer novel insight into market
pricing and positioning under competition with brand effect.

dynamical systems, often in biological contexts such as consumer-resource
models and similar compartmental models. Typically, their usage is intuitive
and informal. Here, we present a formalized version of flow diagrams as a kind
of weighted directed graph which follow a strict grammar, which translate into
a system of ordinary differential equations (ODEs) by a single unambiguous
rule, and which have an equivalent representation as a relational database. (We
abbreviate this schema of ""ODEs and formalized flow diagrams"" as OFFl.) Drawing
a diagram within this strict grammar encourages a mental discipline on the part
of the modeler in which all dynamical processes of a system are thought of as
interactions between dynamical species that draw parcels from one or more
source species and deposit them into target species according to a set of
transformation rules. From these rules, the net rate of change for each species
can be derived. The modeling schema can therefore be understood as both an
epistemic and practical heuristic for modeling, serving both as an
organizational framework for the model building process and as a mechanism for
deriving ODEs. All steps of the schema beyond the initial scientific
(intuitive, creative) abstraction of natural observations into model variables
are algorithmic and easily carried out by a computer, thus enabling the future
development of a dedicated software implementation. Such tools would empower
the modeler to consider significantly more complex models than practical
limitations might have otherwise proscribed, since the modeling framework
itself manages that complexity on the modeler's behalf. In this report, we
describe the chief motivations for OFFl, outline its implementation, and
utilize a range of classic examples from ecology and epidemiology to showcase
its features.

  Measurement of User Behavior","16 pages",,,,"cs.NI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Unraveling quality of experience (QoE) of video streaming is very challenging
in bandwidth shared wireless networks. It is unclear how QoE metrics such as
starvation probability and buffering time interact with dynamics of streaming
traffic load. In this paper, we collect view records from one of the largest
streaming providers in China over two weeks and perform an in-depth measurement
study on flow arrival and viewing time that shed light on the real traffic
pattern. Our most important observation is that the viewing time of streaming
users fits a hyper-exponential distribution quite well. This implies that all
the views can be categorized into two classes, short and long views with
separated time scales. We then map the measured traffic pattern to bandwidth
shared cellular networks and propose an analytical framework to compute the
closed-form starvation probability on the basis of ordinary differential
equations (ODEs). Our framework can be naturally extended to investigate
practical issues including the progressive downloading and the finite video
duration. Extensive trace-driven simulations validate the accuracy of our
models. Our study reveals that the starvation metrics of the short and long
views possess different sensitivities to the scheduling priority at base
station. Hence, a better QoE tradeoff between the short and long views has a
potential to be leveraged by offering them different scheduling weights. The
flow differentiation involves tremendous technical and non-technical challenges
because video content is owned by content providers but not the network
operators and the viewing time of each session is unknown beforehand. To
overcome these difficulties, we propose an online Bayesian approach to infer
the viewing time of each incoming flow with the ""least"" information from
content providers.

integrable sigma-models. We start by reviewing in details the supercoset
construction of the superstring action in $AdS_5 \times S^5$, pointing out the
limits of this procedure for $AdS_4$ and $AdS_3$ backgrounds. For the $AdS_4
\times CP^3$ case we give a thorough derivation of an alternative action, based
on the double-dimensional reduction of eleven-dimensional super-membranes. We
then consider the expansion about the BMN vacuum and the S-matrix for the
scattering of worldsheet excitations in the decompactification limit. To
evaluate its elements efficiently we describe a unitarity-based method
resulting in a very compact formula yielding the cut-constructible part of any
one-loop two-dimensional S-matrix. In the second part of this review we analyze
the superstring action on $AdS_4 \times CP^3$ expanded around the null cusp
vacuum. The free energy of this model, whose computation we reproduce up to
two-loops at strong coupling, is related to the cusp anomalous dimension of the
ABJM theory and, indirectly, to a non-trivial effective coupling $h(\lambda)$
featuring all integrability-based calculations in $AdS_4/CFT_3$. Finally, we
extensively discuss the comparison of the perturbative results and the
integrability predictions for the one-loop dispersion relation of GKP
excitations. Our results provide valuable data in support of the quantum
consistency of the string actions - often debated due to possible issues with
cancellation of UV divergences and the lack of manifest power-counting
renormalizability - and furnish non-trivial stringent tests for the quantum
integrability of the analyzed models.

is a key aspect of functional connectivity research. Such topics are obscured
by the widespread use of sparse binary network models which are fundamentally
different to the complete weighted networks derived from functional
connectivity. We introduce two techniques to probe the hierarchical complexity
of topologies. Firstly, a new metric to measure hierarchical complexity;
secondly, a Weighted Complex Hierarchy (WCH) model. To thoroughly evaluate our
techniques, we generalise sparse binary network archetypes to weighted forms
and explore the main topological features of brain networks- integration,
regularity and modularity- using curves over density. By controlling the
parameters of our model, the highest complexity is found to arise between a
random topology and a strict 'class-based' topology. Further, the model has
equivalent complexity to EEG phase-lag networks at peak performance.
Hierarchical complexity attains greater magnitude and range of differences
between different networks than the previous commonly used complexity metric
and our WCH model offers a much broader range of network topology than the
standard scale-free and small-world models at a full range of densities. Our
metric and model provide a rigorous characterisation of hierarchical
complexity. Importantly, our framework shows a scale of complexity arising
between 'all nodes are equal' topologies at one extreme and 'strict
class-based' topologies at the other.

theoretically study the Shubnikov-de Haas oscillation of Weyl and Dirac
semimetals, taking into account their topological nature and inter-Landau band
scattering. For a Weyl semimetal with broken time-reversal symmetry, the phase
shift is found to change nonmonotonically and go beyond known values of $\pm
1/8$ and $\pm 5/8$. For a Dirac semimetal or paramagnetic Weyl semimetal,
time-reversal symmetry leads to a discrete phase shift of $\pm 1/8$ or $\pm
5/8$, as a function of the Fermi energy. Different from the previous works, we
find that the topological band inversion can lead to beating patterns in the
absence of Zeeman splitting. We also find the resistivity peaks should be
assigned integers in the Landau index plot. Our findings may account for recent
experiments in Cd$_2$As$_3$ and should be helpful for exploring the Berry phase

Quantitative conflict research has found common temporal and other statistical
patterns in warfare, but very little is understood about its general spatial
patterns. While the importance of topology in geostrategy has long been
recognised, the role of spatial patterns of cities in determining a region's
vulnerability to conflict has gone unexplored. Here, we show that global
patterns in war and peace are closely related to the relative position of
cities in a global interaction network. We find that regions with betweenness
centrality above a certain threshold are often engulfed in entrenched conflict,
while a high degree correlates with peace. In fact, betweenness accounts for
over 80% of the variance in number of attacks. This metric is also a good
predictor of the distance to a conflict zone and can estimate the risk of
conflict. We conjecture that a high betweenness identifies areas with fuzzy
cultural boundaries, whereas high degree cities are in cores where peace is
more easily maintained. This is supported by a simple agent-based model in
which cities influence their neighbours, which exhibits the same threshold
behaviour with betweenness as seen in conflict data. These findings not only
shed new light on the causes of violence, but could be used to estimate the
risk associated with actions such as the merging of cities, construction of
transportation infrastructure, or interventions in trade or migration patterns.

The techniques presented here allow us to prove that any convex, quasi-ancient

The main tools are geometric, employing the maximum principle, a rigidity

(i.e., where input arrives on the fly) from the unique perspective of designing
lower bounds on the competitive ratio. In particular, we provide a general
technique for obtaining online deterministic and randomized lower bounds (i.e.,
hardness results) on the competitive ratio for a wide variety of problems. We
show the usefulness of our approach by providing new, tight lower bounds for
three diverse online problems. The three problems we show tight lower bounds
for are the Vector Bin Packing problem, Ad-auctions (and various online
matching problems), and the Capital Investment problem. Our methods are
sufficiently general that they can also be used to reconstruct existing lower
bounds.
  Our techniques are in stark contrast to previous works, which exploit linear
programming duality to obtain positive results, often via the useful
primal-dual scheme. We design a general recipe with the opposite aim of
obtaining negative results via duality. The general idea behind our approach is
to construct a primal linear program based on a collection of input sequences,
where the objective function corresponds to optimizing the competitive ratio.
We then obtain the corresponding dual linear program and provide a feasible
solution, where the objective function yields a lower bound on the competitive
ratio. Online lower bounds are often achieved by adapting the input sequence
according to an online algorithm's behavior and doing an appropriate ad hoc
case analysis. Using our unifying techniques, we simultaneously combine these
cases into one linear program and achieve online lower bounds via a more robust
analysis. We are confident that our framework can be successfully applied to
produce many more lower bounds for a wide array of online problems.

understand the properties of starbursts at intermediate and low redshift, it is
fundamental to track their evolution and possible link with the systems at
higher $z$. We present an extensive, systematic, and multi-band search and
analysis of the starburst galaxies at redshift ($0 < z < 0.5$) in the COSMOS

using Hubble Space Telescope/Advance Camera for Surveys (HST/ACS) images. Their
principal properties, sizes, masses, and star formation rates are provided. The
individual star-forming knots in our sample follow the same L(H$\alpha$) vs.

However, they slightly differ from the one provided using samples at high

star-forming regions for this kind of study. Star-forming clumps in the central
regions of Mknots galaxies are more massive, and present higher star formation
rates, than those in the outskirts. This trend is smeared when we consider
either the mass surface density or surface star formation rate. Sknot galaxies
do show properties similar to both dwarf elliptical and irregulars in the

an input of two-particle irreducible functional renormalization-group (2PI-fRG)
approach. Using 2PI-fRG approach allows us to treat both, local and non-local

have similar (although not identical) structure to the earlier developed
DMF$^2$RG approach. In a simplest truncation, neglecting scale-dependence of
the two-particle irreducible vertices, we reproduce the results for the
two-particle vertices/susceptibilities in the ladder approximation of the dual
boson or D$\Gamma$A approach; in more sophisticated truncations the method
allows us to consider non-local corrections to the self-energy, as well as the
interplay of charge- and spin correlations. treatment of vertex
renormalizations. The proposed scheme is tested on the two-dimensional standard
and extended $U$-$V$ half-filled Hubbard models. For the standard Hubbard model
we obtain non-local self-energy, which is in agreement with numerical studies;
for the extended Hubbard model we obtain the boundary of charge instability,
which agrees well with the results of the dual boson (DB) approach. We also
find that the effect of spin correlations on electron interaction in the charge
channel, not considered previously in the DB approach, only slightly reduces
critical next-nearest-neighbor interaction of charge instability of the
extended Hubbard model at the considered finite small temperature, yielding
better agreement with dynamic cluster approximation. The considered method is
rather general and can be applied to study various phenomena in
strongly-correlated electronic systems.

resulting quantum noise interference can be used to ground-state cool a

demonstrate how quantum noise interference controls linear backaction effects,
and show that this interference persists even outside the adiabatic limit. For
a one-port cavity in the extreme bad-cavity limit, the interference allows one
to cancel all linear backaction effects. This allows continuous measurements of
position-squared, with no stringent constraints on the single-photon
optomechanical coupling strength. In contrast, such a complete cancellation is
not possible in the good cavity limit. This places strict bounds on the

attention recently for their unique electronic structure, spin texture and
physical properties. Very lately, a new type of Weyl semimetals has been
proposed where the Weyl Fermions emerge at the boundary between electron and
hole pockets in a new phase of matter, which is distinct from the standard type
I Weyl semimetals with a point-like Fermi surface. The Weyl cone in this type
II semimetals is strongly tilted and the related Fermi surface undergos a
Lifshitz transition, giving rise to a new kind of chiral anomaly and other new
physics. MoTe2 is proposed to be a candidate of a type II Weyl semimetal; the
sensitivity of its topological state to lattice constants and correlation also
makes it an ideal platform to explore possible topological phase transitions.
By performing laser-based angle-resolved photoemission (ARPES) measurements
with unprecedentedly high resolution, we have uncovered electronic evidence of
type II semimetal state in MoTe2. We have established a full picture of the
bulk electronic states and surface state for MoTe2 that are consistent with the
band structure calculations. A single branch of surface state is identified
that connects bulk hole pockets and bulk electron pockets. Detailed
temperature-dependent ARPES measurements show high intensity spot-like features
that is ~40 meV above the Fermi level and is close to the momentum space
consistent with the theoretical expectation of the type II Weyl points. Our
results constitute electronic evidence on the nature of the Weyl semimetal
state that favors the presence of two sets of type II Weyl points in MoTe2.

singlet scalar. This would provide an ideal candidate for a gauge singlet
scalar alternative to Higgs Inflation, S-inflation. Here we discuss the
relevant results of S-inflation in the context of the 750 GeV resonance. In
particular, we show that a singlet scalar, if it is real, has a major advantage
over the Higgs boson with regard to unitarity violation during inflation. This
is because it is possible to restrict the large non-minimal coupling required
for inflation, $\xi \sim 10^5$, to the real singlet scalar, with all other
scalars having $\xi \sim 1$. In this case the scale of unitarity violation
$\Lambda$ is much larger than the inflaton field during inflation. This
protects the inflaton effective potential from modification by the new physics
or strong coupling which is necessary to restore unitarity, which would
otherwise invalidate the perturbative effective potential based on Standard
Model physics. This is in contrast to the case of Higgs Inflation or models
based on complex singlet scalars, where the unitarity violation scale during
inflation is less than or of the order of the inflaton field. Therefore if the
750 GeV resonance is the inflaton, it must be a non-minimally coupled real
singlet scalar.

mutations produces subpopulations of cells with distinct mutational profiles,

the features as nodes in a latent tree. The resulting model can capture both
the acquisition and the loss of mutations, as well as episodes of convergent

performance on controlled biological data, comparing our reconstructions to
those of several published state-of-the-art methods. We show that our method

their genotypes and frequencies even at a modest sequencing depth. As a proof

component to camera-display messaging, such as handheld smartphones capturing
information from electronic signage. Each color pixel in the display image is
modified by a particular color gradient vector. The challenge is to find the
color gradient that maximizes camera response, while minimizing human response.
The mismatch in human spectral and camera sensitivity curves creates an
opportunity for hidden messaging. Our approach does not require knowledge of
these sensitivity curves, instead we employ a data-driven method. We learn an
ellipsoidal partitioning of the six-dimensional space of colors and color
gradients. This partitioning creates metamer sets defined by the base color at
the display pixel and the color gradient direction for message encoding. We
sample from the resulting metamer sets to find color steps for each base color
to embed a binary message into an arbitrary image with reduced visible
artifacts. Unlike previous methods that rely on visually obtrusive intensity
modulation, we embed with color so that the message is more hidden. Ordinary
displays and cameras are used without the need for expensive LEDs or high speed
devices. The primary contribution of this work is a framework to map the pixels
in an arbitrary image to a metamer pair for steganographic photo messaging.

classified into the following: looking for Earth-like conditions or the planets
similar to the Earth (Earth similarity), and looking for the possibility of
life in a form known or unknown to us (habitability). The two frequently used
indices, ESI and PHI, describe heuristic methods to score
similarity/habitability in the efforts to categorize different exoplanets or
exomoons. ESI, in particular, considers Earth as the reference frame for
habitability and is a quick screening tool to categorize and measure physical
similarity of any planetary body with the Earth. The PHI assesses the
probability that life in some form may exist on any given world, and is based
on the essential requirements of known life: a stable and protected substrate,
energy, appropriate chemistry and a liquid medium. We propose here a different
metric, a Cobb-Douglas Habitability Score (CDHS), based on Cobb-Douglas
habitability production function (CD-HPF), which computes the habitability
score by using measured and calculated planetary input parameters. The proposed
metric, with exponents accounting for metric elasticity, is endowed with
verifiable analytical properties that ensure global optima, and is scalable to
accommodate finitely many input parameters. The model is elastic, does not
suffer from curvature violations and, as we discovered, the standard PHI is a
special case of CDHS. Computed CDHS scores are fed to K-NN (K-Nearest
Neighbour) classification algorithm with probabilistic herding that facilitates
the assignment of exoplanets to appropriate classes via supervised feature
learning methods, producing granular clusters of habitability. The proposed
work describes a decision-theoretical model using the power of convex

leading by Hamilton's variational principle to fractional Laplacian matrices
having the forms of power law matrix functions of the simple local Bornvon
Karman Laplacian. The fractional Laplacian matrices are well defined on
periodic and infinite lattices in $n=1,2,3,..$ dimensions. The present approach
generalizes the central symmetric second differenceoperator (Born von Karman
Laplacian) to its fractional central symmetric counterpart (Fractional
Laplacian matrix).For non-integer powers of the Born von Karman Laplacian, the
fractional Laplacian matrix is nondiagonal with nonzero matrix elements
everywhere, corresponding to nonlocal behavior: For large lattices the matrix
elements far from the diagonal expose power law asymptotics leading to
continuum limit kernels of Riesz fractional derivative type. We present
explicit results for the fractional Laplacian matrix in 1D for finite periodic
and infinite linear chains and their Riesz fractional derivative continuum
limit kernels.The approach recovers for $\alpha=2$ the well known classical
Born von Karman linear chain (1D lattice) with local next neighbor
springsleading in the well known continuum limit of classic local standard
elasticity, and for other integer powers to gradient elasticity.We also present
a generalization of the fractional Laplacian matrix to n-dimensional cubic
periodic (nD tori) and infinite lattices. For the infinite nD lattice we
deducea convenient integral representation.We demonstrate that our fractional
lattice approach is a powerful tool to generate physically admissible nonlocal
lattice material models and their continuum representations.

currently an active research area, since it has the potential to illuminate the
physics and geometry of the innermost region (i.e. close to the putative
super-massive black hole) in these objects. To obtain reliable information from
these studies, the statistical properties of time-lags estimated from data must
be known as accurately as possible.
  Aims: We investigated the statistical properties of Fourier-based time-lag
estimates (i.e. based on the cross-periodogram), using evenly sampled time
series with no missing points. Our aim is to provide practical `guidelines' on
estimating time-lags that are minimally biased (i.e. whose mean is close to
their intrinsic value) and have known errors.}
  Methods: Our investigation is based on both analytical work and extensive
numerical simulations. The latter consisted of generating artificial time
series with various signal-to-noise ratios and sampling patterns/durations
similar to those offered by AGN observations with present and past X-ray
satellites. We also considered a range of different model time-lag spectra
commonly assumed in X-ray analyses of compact accreting systems.
  Results: Discrete sampling, binning and finite light curve duration cause the
mean of the time-lag estimates to have a smaller magnitude than their intrinsic
values. Smoothing (i.e. binning over consecutive frequencies) of the
cross-periodogram can add extra bias at low frequencies. The use of light
curves with low signal-to-noise ratio reduces the intrinsic coherence, and can
introduce a bias to the sample coherence, time-lag estimates, and their
predicted error.

equivalent to those of the characteristic determining parameter $\theta$ which
is governed by a one-dimensional ODE. %for the parameter specifying the
position on the line segment. This one-dimensional ODE is used to show that if
the solution to the determining form converges to the fixed state it does so no
faster than $\mathcal{O}(\tau^{-1/2})$, otherwise it converges to a projection
of some other trajectory in the global attractor of the NSE, but no faster than
$\mathcal{O}(\tau^{-1})$, as $\tau \to \infty$, where $\tau$ is the

exploited in computations which suggest that the one-sided convergence rate

convergence to an exponential rate. Remarkably, it is shown that the zeros of
the scalar function that governs the dynamics of $\theta$, which are called
characteristic determining values, identify in a unique fashion the
trajectories in the global attractor of the 2D NSE. Furthermore, the
one-dimensional characteristic determining form enables us to find
unanticipated geometric features of the global attractor, a subject of future
research.

  Undirected Graphical Models",,,,,"stat.ML math.ST stat.TH","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Structure discovery in graphical models is the determination of the topology
of a graph that encodes conditional independence properties of the joint
distribution of all variables in the model. For some class of probability
distributions, an edge between two variables is present if and only if the
corresponding entry in the precision matrix is non-zero. For a finite sample
estimate of the precision matrix, entries close to zero may be due to low
sample effects, or due to an actual association between variables; these two
cases are not readily distinguishable. %Fisher provided a hypothesis test based
on a parametric approximation to the distribution of an entry in the precision
matrix of a Gaussian distribution, but this may not provide valid upper bounds
on $p$-values for non-Gaussian distributions. Many related works on this topic
consider potentially restrictive distributional or sparsity assumptions that
may not apply to a data sample of interest, and direct estimation of the
uncertainty of an estimate of the precision matrix for general distributions
remains challenging. Consequently, we make use of results for $U$-statistics
and apply them to the covariance matrix. By probabilistically bounding the
distortion of the covariance matrix, we can apply Weyl's theorem to bound the
distortion of the precision matrix, yielding a conservative, but sound test
threshold for a much wider class of distributions than considered in previous
works. The resulting test enables one to answer with statistical significance
whether an edge is present in the graph, and convergence results are known for
a wide range of distributions. The computational complexities is linear in the
sample size enabling the application of the test to large data samples for
which computation time becomes a limiting factor. We experimentally validate
the correctness and scalability of the test on multivariate distributions for
which the distributional assumptions of competing tests result in
underestimates of the false positive ratio. By contrast, the proposed test
remains sound, promising to be a useful tool for hypothesis testing for diverse
real-world problems.

additive preferences over objects, revisits to some extent the seminal paper by
Brams and King [9] which was specific to ordinal and linear order preferences
over items. We point out similarities and differences with this latter context.
In particular, we show that any Pareto-optimal allocation (under additive
preferences) is sequenceable, but that the converse is not true anymore. This
asymmetry leads naturally to the definition of a ""scale of efficiency"" having
three steps: Pareto-optimality, sequenceability without Pareto-optimality, and
non-sequenceability. Finally, we investigate the links between these efficiency
properties and the ""scale of fairness"" we have described in an earlier work
[7]: we first show that an allocation can be envy-free and non-sequenceable,
but that every competitive equilibrium with equal incomes is sequenceable. Then
we experimentally explore the links between the scales of efficiency and

investigated using a recently introduced technique called nonlinear Laplacian
spectral analysis (NLSA). Through this technique, drawbacks associated with ad
hoc pre-filtering of the input data are avoided, enabling recovery of
low-frequency and intermittent modes not previously accessible via classical
approaches. Here, a multiscale hierarchy of spatiotemporal modes is identified
for Indo-Pacific SST in millennial control runs of CCSM4 and CM3 and in HadISST
data. On interannual timescales, a mode with spatiotemporal patterns
corresponding to the fundamental component of ENSO emerges, along with
ENSO-modulated annual modes consistent with combination mode theory. The ENSO
combination modes also feature prominent activity in the Indian Ocean,
explaining significant fraction of the SST variance in regions associated with
the Indian Ocean dipole. A pattern resembling the tropospheric biennial
oscillation emerges in addition to ENSO and the associated combination modes.
On multidecadal timescales, the dominant NLSA mode in the model data is
predominantly active in the western tropical Pacific. The interdecadal Pacific
oscillation also emerges as a distinct NLSA mode, though with smaller explained
variance than the western Pacific multidecadal mode. Analogous modes on
interannual and decadal timescales are also identified in HadISST data for the
industrial era, as well as in model data of comparable timespan, though decadal
modes are either absent or of degraded quality in these datasets.

of Markov. As a main result we then prove a version of this theorem for
semigroups which only admit certain individual lower bounds. Moreover, we
generalise a theorem of Ding on semigroups of Frobenius-Perron operators. We
also demonstrate how our results can be adapted to the setting of general
Banach lattices and we give some counterexamples to show optimality of our
results.
  Our methods combine some rather concrete estimates and approximation
arguments with abstract functional analytical tools. One of these tools is a
theorem which relates the convergence of a time-continuous operator semigroup
to the convergence of embedded discrete semigroups.

sediments in the interior of the white dwarfs. This process releases an
additional amount of energy, thus delaying the cooling times of the white
dwarf. This influences the ages of different stellar populations derived using
white dwarf cosmochronology. Furthermore, the overabundance of $^{22}$Ne in the
inner regions of the star, modifies the Brunt-V\""ais\""al\""a frequency, thus
altering the pulsational properties of these stars. In this work, we discuss
the impact of $^{22}$Ne sedimentation in white dwarfs resulting from Solar
metallicity progenitors ($Z=0.02$). We performed evolutionary calculations of
white dwarfs of masses $0.528$, $0.576$, $0.657$ and $0.833$ M$_{\sun}$,
derived from full evolutionary computations of their progenitor stars, starting
at the Zero Age Main Sequence all the way through central hydrogen and helium
burning, thermally-pulsing AGB and post-AGB phases. Our computations show that
at low luminosities ($\log(L/L_{\sun})\la -4.25$), $^{22}$Ne sedimentation
delays the cooling of white dwarfs with Solar metallicity progenitors by about
1~Gyr. Additionally, we studied the consequences of $^{22}$Ne sedimentation on
the pulsational properties of ZZ~Ceti white dwarfs. We find that $^{22}$Ne
sedimentation induces differences in the periods of these stars larger than the
present observational uncertainties, particularly in more massive white dwarfs.

two-dimensional circular traps lead to particle localization and formation of
quantum Wigner molecules (QWMs) possessing definite point-group space
symmetries. These point-group symmetries are ""hidden"" (or emergent), namely
they cannot be traced in the circular single-particle densities (SPDs)
associated with the exact many-body wave functions, but they are manifested as
characteristic signatures in the ro-vibrational spectra. An example, among
many, are the few-body QWM states under a high magnetic field or at fast
rotation, which are precursor states for the fractional quantum Hall effect.
The hidden geometric symmetries can be directly revealed by using spin-resolved
conditional probability distributions, which are extracted from
configuration-interaction (CI), exact-diagonalization wave functions. The
hidden symmetries can also be revealed in the CI SPDs by reducing the symmetry
of the trap (from circular to elliptic to quasi-linear). In addition the hidden
symmetries are directly connected to the explicitly broken-symmetry (BS)
solutions of mean-field approaches, such as unrestricted Hartree-Fock (UHF). A
companion step of restoration of the broken symmetries via projection operators
applied on the BS-UHF solutions produces wave functions directly comparable to
the CI ones, and sheds further light into the role played by the emergence of
hidden symmetries in the exact many-body wave functions. Illustrative examples
of the importance of hidden symmetries in the many-body problem of few
electrons in semiconductor quantum dots and of few ultracold atoms in optical
traps (where unprecedented control of the interparticle interaction has been
experimentally achieved recently) will be presented.

temperatures, halo masses, stellar kinematics) are shedding new light on galaxy
formation. Here we present the hot X-ray gas properties of 33 early-type
systems within the MASSIVE galaxy survey sample that have archival Chandra
X-ray observations. Through careful X-ray spectral modeling, we derive X-ray
luminosities (L_X) and plasma temperatures (T_gas) for the diffuse gas
components in these galaxies. We combine the MASSIVE sample with 41 galaxies
from the ATLAS^3D survey to investigate the X-ray and optical properties of a
statistically significant sample of nearby early-type galaxies across a
wide-range of environments. We deduce that all early-type galaxies (independent
of galaxy mass and rotational support) follow a universal scaling law such that
L_X~T_gas^4.5. When X-ray measurements are performed consistently in apertures
set by the galaxy stellar content, the wide-scale environment does not
contribute to the intrinsic scatter (~0.5dex) within the scaling relation. We
further demonstrate that the scatter in L_X around both K-band luminosity (L_K)
and the galaxy stellar velocity dispersion is primarily driven by T_gas, with
no clear trends with halo mass, radio power, or angular momentum of the stars.
It is not trivial to tie the origin of the gas directly to either the stellar
mass or the galaxy potential. Indeed, our data require a steeper relation
between L_X, L_K, and sigma_e than predicted by standard mass-loss models.
Finally, we find a statistically significant correlation between sigma_e and
T_gas, suggesting that T_gas is set by the galaxy potential inside the optical
effective radius. We conclude that within the inner-most 10-30kpc region,
early-types maintain pressure-supported hot gas, with a minimum T_gas set by
the virial temperature, but the majority show evidence for some additional
heating.

radial migration within the stellar disc sets additional constraints on
Galactic models. By performing controlled test particle simulations in a very
detailed, observationally motivated model of the Milky Way, we demonstrate
that, in the inner region of the disc, the MDF is shaped by the joint action of
the bar and spiral arms, while at outer radii the MDF is mainly shaped by the
spiral arms. We show that the spiral arms are able to imprint their signature
in the radial migration, shaping the MDF in the outskirts of the Galactic disc
with a minimal participation of the bar. Conversely, this work has the
potential to characterise some structural and dynamical parameters of the
spiral arms based on radial migration and the shape of the MDF. Finally, the

seen by APOGEE, show that a fundamental factor influencing their shape is the

lightcone quantization, with the resulting Hamiltonian expressed in terms of
this CFT basis. Truncating to states with $\mathcal{C} \leq
\mathcal{C}_{\max}$, one can numerically find the resulting spectrum, as well
as other dynamical quantities, such as spectral densities of operators. This
method requires the introduction of an appropriate regulator, which can be
chosen to preserve the conformal structure of the basis. We check this
framework in three dimensions for various perturbative deformations of a free
scalar CFT, and for the case of a free $O(N)$ CFT deformed by a mass term and a
non-perturbative quartic interaction at large-$N$. In all cases, the truncation
scheme correctly reproduces known analytic results. We also discuss a general
procedure for generating a basis of Casimir eigenstates for a free CFT in any
number of dimensions.

to be in pressure equilibrium with the X-ray gas near the virial radius of the

agreement with the range of sizes found for spatially resolved HI starless
clumps outside of Virgo. Based on the predicted HI surface density of the Virgo

Surveys in the F475W (g) and F814W (I) passbands and the Wide Field Camera 3 IR
Channel in F160W (H). The GCs in this field exhibit a bimodal optical color
distribution with more than half of the GCs falling on the red side at g-I > 1.
Bimodality is also present, though less conspicuously, in the optical-NIR I-H
color. Consistent with past work, we find evidence for nonlinearity in the g-I
versus I-H color-color relation. Our results thus underscore the need for
understanding the detailed form of the color-metallicity relations in
interpreting observational data on GC bimodality. We also find a very strong
color-magnitude trend, or ""blue tilt,"" for the blue component of the optical
color distribution of the NGC 4874 GC system. A similarly strong trend is
present for the overall mean I-H color as a function of magnitude; for M_814 <
-10 mag, these trends imply a steep mass-metallicity scaling with $Z\propto
M_{\rm GC}^{1.4\pm0.4}$, but the scaling is not a simple power law and becomes
much weaker at lower masses. As in other similar systems, the spatial
distribution of the blue GCs is more extended than that of the red GCs, partly
because of blue GCs associated with surrounding cluster galaxies. In addition,
the center of the GC system is displaced by 4+/-1 kpc towards the southwest
from the luminosity center of NGC 4874, in the direction of NGC 4872. Finally,
we remark on a dwarf elliptical galaxy with a noticeably asymmetrical GC
distribution. Interestingly, this dwarf has a velocity of nearly -3000 km/s
with respect to NGC 4874; we suggest it is on its first infall into the cluster
core and is undergoing stripping of its GC system by the cluster potential.

highly star forming galaxies can only be formed in the highest peaks of the

epochs, while at later times cosmic structure may have matured sufficiently

a weakly varying flat (Gamma~1.5-1.7) power-law component; ii) a constant, cold

thermal Comptonization; and iv) a constant, ionized scattered emission-line
dominated component. Our main findings are that, during the 2013 campaign, the
first 3 of these components appear to be partially covered by a heavy and
variable obscurer located along the l.o.s. that is consistent with a multilayer
of cold and mildly ionized gas. We characterize in detail the short timescale
(~ks-to-days) spectral variability of this new obscurer, and find it is mostly
due to a combination of Nh and Cf variations, on top of intrinsic power-law
variations. In addition, our best-fit spectrum is left with several (but
marginal) absorption features at rest-frame energies ~6.7-6.9 keV and ~8 keV,
as well as a weak broad emission line feature redwards of the 6.4 keV emission
line. These could indicate a more complex underlying model, e.g. a P-Cygni-type
profile if allowing for a large velocity and wide-angle outflow. These findings
are consistent with a picture where the obscurer represents the manifestation
along the l.o.s. of a multilayer of gas that is likely outflowing at high
speed, and simultaneously producing heavy obscuration and scattering in the
X-rays and broad absorption features in the UV.

the gravitational influence of a precessing eccentric gas disk. Methods. We
embed the results of our previous hydrodynamical simulations of protoplanetary
disks around binaries into an N-body code to perform 3D, high-resolution,
inter-particle gravity-enabled simulations of planetesimal growth and dynamics
that include the gravitational force imparted by the gas. Results. Including
the full, precessing asymmetric gas disk generates high eccentricity orbits for
planetesimals orbiting at the edge of the circumbinary cavity, where the gas
surface density and eccentricity have their largest values. The gas disk is
able to efficiently align planetesimal pericenters in some regions leading to
phased, non-interacting orbits. Outside of these areas eccentric planetesimal
orbits become misaligned and overlap leading to crossing orbits and high
relative velocities during planetesimal collisions. This can lead to an
increase in the number of erosive collisions that far outweighs the number of
collisions that result in growth. Gravitational focusing from the static
axisymmetric gas disk is weak and does not significantly alter collision
outcomes from the gas free case. Conclusions. Due to asymmetries in the gas
disk, planetesimals are strongly perturbed onto highly eccentric orbits. Where
planetesimals orbits are not well aligned, orbit crossings lead to an increase
in the number of erosive collisions. This makes it difficult for sustained
planetesimal accretion to occur at the location of Kepler-16b and Kepler-34b
and we therefore rule out in-situ growth. This adds further support to our
initial suggestions that most circumbinary planets should form further out in
the disk and migrate inwards.

despite its round shape. The proper motions on the western and southwestern
sides of the remnant are about a factor of two higher than those in the east

of the explosion site from the geometric center of the remnant due to a density
gradient in the ISM, and using our refined measurements reported here, we find
that this offset is $\sim 23""$ towards the northeast. An explosion center
offset in such a circular remnant has implications for searches for progenitor

Jupiters with outer friends. We show that the majority of the observed Jupiter
pairs (twenty out of twenty-four) will be dynamically unstable if the inner
planet was placed at >~1AU distance from the stellar host. This finding is at
odds with formation theories that invoke the migration of such planets from
semi-major axes >~1AU due to secular dynamical processes (e.g., secular chaos,
Lidov-Kozai oscillations) coupled with tidal dissipation. In fact, the results
of N-body integrations show that the evolution of dynamically unstable systems
does not lead to tidal migration but rather to planet ejections and collisions
with the host star. This and other arguments lead us to suggest that most of
the observed planets with a companion could not have been transported from
further out through secular migration processes. More generally, by using a
combination of numerical and analytic techniques we show that the high-e
Lidov-Kozai migration scenario can only account for less than 10% of all gas
giants observed between 0.1-1 AU. Simulations of multi-planet systems support
this result. Our study indicates that rather than starting on highly eccentric
orbits with orbital periods above one year, these ""warm"" Jupiters are more

theory as a sum of Feynman diagrams each of which is manifestly free from
ultraviolet divergences. The interaction vertices fall off exponentially for
large space-like external momenta making the ultraviolet finiteness property
manifest, but blow up exponentially for large time-like external momenta making
it impossible to take the integration contours for loop energies to lie along
the real axis. This forces us to carry out the integrals over the loop energies
by choosing appropriate contours in the complex plane whose ends go to infinity
along the imaginary axis but which take complicated form in the interior
navigating around the various poles of the propagators. We consider the general
class of quantum field theories with this property and prove Cutkosky rules for
the amplitudes to all orders in perturbation theory. Besides having
applications to string field theory, these results also give an alternative
derivation of Cutkosky rules in ordinary quantum field theories.

alternative methods to the traditional Cepheid distance scale. We aim to
establish a completely independent route to the Hubble constant using RR Lyrae
variables, the tip of the red giant branch (TRGB), and Type Ia supernovae (SNe
Ia). This alternative distance ladder can be applied to galaxies of any Hubble
Type, of any inclination, and, utilizing old stars in low density environments,
is robust to the degenerate effects of metallicity and interstellar extinction.
Given the relatively small number of SNe Ia host galaxies with independently
measured distances, these properties provide a great systematic advantage in
the measurement of the Hubble constant via the distance ladder. Initially, the
accuracy of our value of the Hubble constant will be set by the five Galactic
RR Lyrae calibrators with Hubble Space Telescope Fine-Guidance Sensor
parallaxes. With Gaia, both the RR Lyrae zero point and TRGB method will be
independently calibrated, the former with at least an order of magnitude more
calibrators and the latter directly through parallax measurement of tip red
giants. As the first end-to-end ""distance ladder"" completely independent of
both Cepheid variables and the Large Magellanic Cloud, this path to the Hubble
constant will allow for the high precision comparison at each rung of the
traditional distance ladder that is necessary to understand tensions between
this and other routes to the Hubble constant.

excessive number of small DNA segments -- called short reads -- that cause
significant computational burden. To analyze the entire genome, each of the
billions of short reads must be mapped to a reference genome based on the
similarity between a read and ""candidate"" locations in that reference genome.
The similarity measurement, called alignment, formulated as an approximate
string matching problem, is the computational bottleneck because: (1) it is
implemented using quadratic-time dynamic programming algorithms, and (2) the
majority of candidate locations in the reference genome do not align with a
given read due to high dissimilarity. Calculating the alignment of such
incorrect candidate locations consumes an overwhelming majority of a modern
read mapper's execution time. Therefore, it is crucial to develop a fast and
effective filter that can detect incorrect candidate locations and eliminate
them before invoking computationally costly alignment operations. Results: We
propose GateKeeper, a new hardware accelerator that functions as a
pre-alignment step that quickly filters out most incorrect candidate locations.
GateKeeper is the first design to accelerate pre-alignment using
Field-Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs), which can perform pre-alignment much
faster than software. GateKeeper can be integrated with any mapper that
performs sequence alignment for verification. When implemented on a single FPGA
chip, GateKeeper maintains high accuracy (on average >96%) while providing up
to 90-fold and 130-fold speedup over the state-of-the-art software
pre-alignment techniques, Adjacency Filter and Shifted Hamming Distance (SHD),
respectively. The addition of GateKeeper as a pre-alignment step can reduce the
verification time of the mrFAST mapper by a factor of 10. Availability:

Restricted Boltzmann Machine (DRBM). While originally the DRBM was defined
assuming the {0, 1}-Bernoulli distribution in each of its hidden units, this
result makes it possible to derive cost functions for variants of the DRBM that
utilise other distributions, including some that are often encountered in the
literature. This is illustrated with the Binomial and {-1, +1}-Bernoulli
distributions here. We evaluate these two DRBM variants and compare them with
the original one on three benchmark datasets, namely the MNIST and USPS digit
classification datasets, and the 20 Newsgroups document classification dataset.
Results show that each of the three compared models outperforms the remaining
two in one of the three datasets, thus indicating that the proposed theoretical
generalisation of the DRBM may be valuable in practice.

solving three-dimensional, viscous, incompressible flows on unbounded domains
is presented. Immersed surfaces with prescribed motions are generated using the
interpolation and regularization operators obtained from the discrete delta
function approach of the original (Peskin's) immersed boundary method. Unlike
Peskin's method, boundary forces are regarded as Lagrange multipliers that are
used to satisfy the no-slip condition. The incompressible Navier-Stokes
equations are discretized on an unbounded staggered Cartesian grid and are
solved in a finite number of operations using lattice Green's function
techniques. These techniques are used to automatically enforce the natural
free-space boundary conditions and to implement a novel block-wise adaptive
grid that significantly reduces the run-time cost of solutions by limiting
operations to grid cells in the immediate vicinity and near-wake region of the
immersed surface. These techniques also enable the construction of practical
discrete viscous integrating factors that are used in combination with
specialized half-explicit Runge-Kutta schemes to accurately and efficiently
solve the differential algebraic equations describing the discrete momentum
equation, incompressibility constraint, and no-slip constraint. Linear systems
of equations resulting from the time integration scheme are efficiently solved
using an approximation-free nested projection technique. The algebraic
properties of the discrete operators are used to reduce projection steps to
simple discrete elliptic problems, e.g. discrete Poisson problems, that are
compatible with recent parallel fast multipole methods for difference
equations. Numerical experiments on low-aspect-ratio flat plates and spheres at
Reynolds numbers up to 3,700 are used to verify the accuracy and physical

linear elastic waves. Surface tension induces elasticity, and the balance
between surface tension energy and turbulent kinetic energy determines a length
scale (Hinze scale) of the system. The Hinze scale may be thought of as the
scale of emergent critical balance between fluid straining and elastic
restoring forces. The scales between the Hinze scale and dissipation scale
constitute the elastic range of the 2D CHNS system. By direct numerical
simulation, we find that in the elastic range, the mean square concentration
spectrum $H^\psi_k$ of the 2D CHNS system exhibits the same power law ($-7/3$)
as the mean square magnetic potential spectrum $H^A_k$ in the inverse cascade
regime of 2D MHD. This power law is consistent with an inverse cascade of
$H^\psi$, which is observed. The kinetic energy spectrum of the 2D CHNS system
is $E^K_k\sim k^{-3}$ if forced at large scale, suggestive of the direct
enstrophy cascade power law of 2D Navier-Stokes (NS) turbulence. The difference
from the energy spectra of 2D MHD turbulence implies that the back reaction of
the concentration field to fluid motion is limited. We suggest this is because
the surface tension back reaction is significant only in the interfacial

(NA) duplexes induced by tri-valent cobalt(III) hexammine (CoHex) ions. The
model is based on partitioning of bound counterion distribution around singleNA
duplex into ""external"" and ""internal"" ion binding shells distinguished by the
proximity to duplex helical axis. In the aggregated phase the shells overlap,
which leads to significantly increased attraction of CoHex ions in these
overlaps with the neighboring duplexes. The duplex aggregation free energy is
decomposed into attractive and repulsive components in such a way that they can
be represented by simple analytical expressions with parameters derived from
molecular dynamic (MD) simulations and numerical solutions of Poisson equation.
The short-range interactions described by the attractive term depend on the
fractions of bound ions in the overlapping shells and affinity of CoHex to the
""external"" shell of nearly neutralized duplex. The repulsive components of the
free energy are duplex configurational entropy loss upon the aggregation and
the electrostatic repulsion of the duplexes that remains after neutralization
by bound CoHex ions. The estimates of the aggregation free energy are
consistent with the experimental range of NA duplex condensation propensities,
including the unusually poor condensation of RNA structures and subtle sequence
effects upon DNA condensation. The model predicts that, in contrast to DNA, RNA
duplexes may condense into tighter packed aggregates with a higher degree of
duplex neutralization. The model also predicts that longer NA fragments will
condense more readily than shorter ones. The ability of this model to explain
experimentally observed trends in NA condensation, lends support to proposed NA
condensation picture based on the multivalent ""ion binding shells"".

resolve two well-known problems with this approach: In the discounted-cost

compensations. Therefore, a crowd based algorithm must judiciously use any
information computed through an automated process, and ask minimum number of
questions to the crowd adaptively.
  One such problem which has received significant attention is {\em entity
resolution}. Formally, we are given a graph $G=(V,E)$ with unknown edge set $E$
where $G$ is a union of $k$ (again unknown, but typically large $O(n^\alpha)$,
for $\alpha>0$) disjoint cliques $G_i(V_i, E_i)$, $i =1, \dots, k$. The goal is
to retrieve the sets $V_i$s by making minimum number of pair-wise queries $V
\times V\to\{\pm1\}$ to an oracle (the crowd). When the answer to each query is
correct, e.g. via resampling, then this reduces to finding connected components
in a graph. On the other hand, when crowd answers may be incorrect, it
corresponds to clustering over minimum number of noisy inputs. Even, with
perfect answers, a simple lower and upper bound of $\Theta(nk)$ on query
complexity can be shown. A major contribution of this paper is to reduce the
query complexity to linear or even sublinear in $n$ when mild side information
is provided by a machine, and even in presence of crowd errors which are not
correctable via resampling. We develop new information theoretic lower bounds
on the query complexity of clustering with side information and errors, and our
upper bounds closely match with them. Our algorithms are naturally
parallelizable, and also give near-optimal bounds on the number of adaptive
rounds required to match the query complexity.

learning patterns from historical transcript data coupled with additional

Application of a novel feature selection technique is key to the predictive
success and interpretability of the FM. By comparing feature importance across
populations and across models, we uncover strong connections between instructor
characteristics and student performance. We also discover key differences
between transfer and non-transfer students. Ultimately we find that a hybrid

returning students taking both new and existing courses. Application of these
techniques holds promise for student degree planning, instructor interventions,

exploiting the small-scale clumpiness of rest-frame far-UV emission in lensed
LAEs, and to thereby constrain the slope and normalization of the
substructure-mass function. In this paper, we describe in detail the
spectroscopic strong-lens selection technique, which is based on methods
adopted in the previous Sloan Lens ACS (SLACS) Survey, BELLS, and SLACS for the
Masses Survey. We present the BELLS GALLERY sample of the 21 highest-quality
galaxy--LAE candidates selected from $\approx 1.4 \times 10^6$ galaxy spectra
in the BOSS of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey III. These systems consist of
massive galaxies at redshifts of approximately 0.5 strongly lensing LAEs at
redshifts from 2--3. The compact nature of LAEs makes them an ideal probe of
dark substructures, with a substructure-mass sensitivity that is unprecedented
in other optical strong-lens samples. The magnification effect from lensing
will also reveal the structure of LAEs below 100 pc scales, providing a
detailed look at the sites of the most concentrated unobscured star formation
in the universe. The source code used for candidate selection is available for
download as a part of this release.

Misestimated sample sizes have negative repercussions in the form of increased

Here I describe a procedure for estimating sample sizes adequate for the

procedure focuses on a desired minimum effect size for the research at hand and
finds the minimum sample size required for capturing such effect size as a

sensitiveness analyses can also be extended to finding the minimum effect for a

near-optimal solution adopting a two-phase optimization approach that separates
the subcarrier and power allocation. In the first phase, we relax the strict
proportional data rate requirements and employ an iterative subcarrier

computing a conjunctive query on a large database in a parallel setting with
$p$ servers. In contrast to previous work, where upper and lower bounds on the
communication were specified for particular structures of data (either data
without skew, or data with specific types of skew), in this work we focus on
worst-case analysis of the communication cost. The goal is to find worst-case
optimal parallel algorithms, similar to the work of [18] for sequential
algorithms.
  We first show that for a single round we can obtain an optimal worst-case
algorithm. The optimal load for a conjunctive query $q$ when all relations have
size equal to $M$ is $O(M/p^{1/\psi^*})$, where $\psi^*$ is a new query-related
quantity called the edge quasi-packing number, which is different from both the
edge packing number and edge cover number of the query hypergraph. For multiple
rounds, we present algorithms that are optimal for several classes of queries.
Finally, we show a surprising connection to the external memory model, which
allows us to translate parallel algorithms to external memory algorithms. This
technique allows us to recover (within a polylogarithmic factor) several recent
results on the I/O complexity for computing join queries, and also obtain
optimal algorithms for other classes of queries.

and present the optimal solutions under both static and dynamic pricing
schemes. In the case of static pricing, the prices do not change with time,

optimal under a wide range of system parameters. In the case of dynamic

secondary users' demands for spectrum opportunities are highly elastic.

of splitting inclusion problem. We want to find a point in the interception of
a finite number of sets that we don't know, the solution of each component of
the system. The algorithm consists of approximate the sets involved in the
problem by separates halfspaces which are a known strategy. By finding these
halfspaces in each iteration we use only one inclusion problem of the system.
The iterations consist of two parts, the first contains an explicit Armijo-type
search in the spirit of the extragradient-like methods for variational
inequalities. In the iterative process, the operator forward-backward is
computed only one time for each inclusion problem, this represents a great
computational saving because the computational cost of this operator is nothing
cheap. The second part consists of special projection step, projecting in the
separating halfspace. The convergence analysis of the proposed scheme is given
assuming monotonicity all operators, without any Lipschitz continuity

oxygen vacancies have been a key ingredient in defect engineering, as they play
a central role in determining the crystal field and consequent electronic

Therefore, experimental approaches toward understanding the role of defects in
complex oxides have been largely limited to controlling oxygen vacancies. In
this study, we report on the selective formation of different types of
elemental vacancies and their individual roles in determining the atomic and
electronic structure of perovskite SrTiO3 (STO) homoepitaxial thin films
fabricated by pulsed laser epitaxy. Structural and electronic transitions have
been achieved via selective control of the Sr and oxygen vacancy
concentrations, respectively, indicating a decoupling between the two phase
transitions. In particular, oxygen vacancies were responsible for
metal-insulator transitions, but did not influence the Sr vacancy induced
cubic-to-tetragonal structural transition in epitaxial STO thin film. The
independent control of multiple phase transitions in complex oxides by
exploiting selective vacancy engineering opens up an unprecedented opportunity
toward understanding and customizing complex oxide thin films.

is studied nu- merically, with particular emphasis on frequency and combined
wavenumber-frequency do- main analyses. Under suitable conditions, simulations
with small-scale random forcing and large-scale drag exhibit a spontaneous
formation of multiple zonal jets. The first hint of wave-like features is seen
in the distribution of kinetic energy as a function of frequency; specifically,
for progressively larger deformation scales there are systematic departures in
the form of isolated peaks (at progressively higher frequencies) from a
power-law scaling. Con- comitantly, there is an inverse flux of kinetic energy
in frequency space which extends to lower frequencies for smaller deformation
scales. The identification of these peaks as Rossby waves is made possible by
examining the energy spectrum in frequency-zonal wavenumber and
frequency-meridional wavenumber diagrams. In fact, the modified Rhines scale
turns out to be a useful measure of the dominant meridional wavenumber of the
modulating Rossby waves; once this is fixed, apart from a spectral peak at the
origin (the steady jet), almost all the energy is contained in westward
propagating disturbances that follow the theoretical Rossby dispersion
relation. Quite consistently, noting that the zonal scale of the modulating
waves is restricted to the first few wavenumbers, the energy spectrum is almost
entirely contained within the corresponding Rossby dispersion curves on a
frequency-meridional wavenumber diagram. Cases when jets do not form are also
considered; once again, there is a hint of Rossby wave activity, though the
spectral peaks are quite muted. Further, the kinetic energy scaling in
frequency domain follows a -5/3 power-law and is distributed much more broadly
in frequency-wavenumber diagrams

(FSCs) is derived. A new technique, called the $Q$-contexts, is based on a
construction of a directed graph that is used to quantize recursively the
receiver's output sequences to a finite set of contexts. For any choice of
$Q$-graph, the feedback capacity is bounded by a single-letter expression,
$C_\text{fb}\leq \sup I(X,S;Y|Q)$, where the supremum is over $P_{X|S,Q}$ and
the distribution of $(S,Q)$ is their stationary distribution. It is shown that
the bound is tight for all unifilar FSCs where feedback capacity is known:
channels where the state is a function of the outputs, the trapdoor channel,
Ising channels, the no-consecutive-ones input-constrained erasure channel and
for the memoryless channel. Its efficiency is also demonstrated by deriving a
new capacity result for the dicode erasure channel (DEC); the upper bound is
obtained directly from the above expression and its tightness is concluded with
a general sufficient condition on the optimality of the upper bound. This
sufficient condition is based on a fixed point principle of the BCJR equation
and, indeed, formulated as a simple lower bound on feedback capacity of
unifilar FSCs for arbitrary $Q$-graphs. This upper bound indicates that a
single-letter expression might exist for the capacity of finite-state channels
with or without feedback based on a construction of auxiliary random variable
with specified structure, such as $Q$-graph, and not with i.i.d distribution.
The upper bound also serves as a non-trivial bound on the capacity of channels
without feedback, a problem that is still open.

show how the interplay of electronic and nuclear dynamics can lead to a marked

ab-initio solutions of the time-dependent Schr\""odinger equation for

analytical model, we identify its physical origin, which is the appearance of a
permanent dipole moment in dissociating homonuclear molecules, caused by
light-induced localization of the electric charge during dissociation. The
effect arises for sufficiently long laser pulses and the region of the spectrum
where even harmonics are produced is controlled by pulse duration. Our results
(i) show how the interplay of femtosecond nuclear and attosecond electronic
dynamics, which affects the charge flow inside the dissociating molecule, is

upturns of dust and stars curving ~2 kpc above the disk plane. A kinematically

(HS1603+3820) using the 188-cm Okayama Telescope over the same period as the
photometric observations. Our main results are as follows: (1) Structure
function (SF) analysis revealed that the quasar UV flux variability over three
years was not large enough to support the VIS scenario, unless the ionization
condition of outflow gas is very low. (2) There was no crucial difference
between the SFs of mini-BAL and NAL quasars. (3) The variability of the
mini-BAL and quasar light curves was weakly synchronized with a small time
delay for HS1603+3820. These results suggest that the VIS scenario may need
additional mechanisms such as a variable shielding by X-ray warm absorbers.

estimates are therefore essential for constraining theoretical models. We
measure a lower limit to SDR in a sample of solar-like stars belonging to young
associations with the aim of investigating how SDR depends on global stellar
parameters in the age range (4-95 Myr). The rotation period of a solar-like
star can be recovered by analyzing the flux modulation caused by dark spots and
stellar rotation. The SDR and the latitude migration of dark-spots induce a
modulation of the detected rotation period. We employ long-term photometry to
measure the amplitude of such a modulation and to compute the quantity
DeltaOmega_phot =2p/P_min -2pi/P_max that is a lower limit to SDR. We find that
DeltaOmega_phot increases with the stellar effective temperature and with the
global convective turn-over time-scale tau_c. We find that DeltaOmega_phot is
proportional to Teff^2.18pm 0.65 in stars recently settled on the ZAMS. This
power law is less steep than those found by previous authors, but closest to
recent theoretical models. We find that DeltaOmega_phot steeply increases
between 4 and 30 Myr and that itis almost constant between 30 and 95 Myr in a 1
M_sun star. We find also that the relative shear increases with the Rossby
number Ro. Although our results are qualitatively in agreement with
hydrodynamical mean-field models, our measurements are systematically higher
than the values predicted by these models. The discrepancy between
DeltaOmega_phot measurements and theoretical models is particularly large in
stars with periods between 0.7 and 2 d. Such a discrepancy, together with the
anomalous SDR measured by other authors for HD 171488 (rotating in 1.31 d),
suggests that the rotation period could influence SDR more than predicted by
the models.

uncertainties across large ranges of photometric imaging, for use in
calculating spectral energy distributions. We describe the program,
specifically key features required for robust determination of panchromatic
photometry: propagation of apertures to images with arbitrary resolution, local
background estimation, aperture normalisation, uncertainty determination and
propagation, and object deblending. Using simulated images, we demonstrate that
the program is able to recover accurate photometric measurements in both

apply the program to the 21-band photometric dataset from the Galaxy And Mass

contains imaging spanning the far-UV to the far-IR. We compare photometry
derived from LAMBDAR with that presented in Driver et al. (2016), finding broad
agreement between the datasets. Nonetheless, we demonstrate that the photometry
from LAMBDAR is superior to that from the GAMA PDR, as determined by a
reduction in the outlier rate and intrinsic scatter of colours in the LAMBDAR
dataset. We similarly find a decrease in the outlier rate of stellar masses and
star formation rates using LAMBDAR photometry. Finally, we note an exceptional
increase in the number of UV and mid-IR sources able to be constrained, which
is accompanied by a significant increase in the mid-IR colour-colour

  Interleaved Codex",,,,,"cs.IT cs.CC math.IT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Reed-Muller codes are among the most important classes of locally correctable
codes. Currently local decoding of Reed-Muller codes is based on decoding on
lines or quadratic curves to recover one single coordinate. To recover multiple
coordinates simultaneously, the naive way is to repeat the local decoding for
recovery of a single coordinate. This decoding algorithm might be more
expensive, i.e., require higher query complexity. In this paper, we focus on
Reed-Muller codes with usual parameter regime, namely, the total degree of
evaluation polynomials is $d=\Theta({q})$, where $q$ is the code alphabet size
(in fact, $d$ can be as big as $q/4$ in our setting). By introducing a novel
variation of codex, i.e., interleaved codex (the concept of codex has been used
for arithmetic secret sharing \cite{C11,CCX12}), we are able to locally recover
arbitrarily large number $k$ of coordinates of a Reed-Muller code
simultaneously at the cost of querying $O(q^2k)$ coordinates. It turns out that
our local decoding of Reed-Muller codes shows ({\it perhaps surprisingly}) that
accessing $k$ locations is in fact cheaper than repeating the procedure for
accessing a single location for $k$ times. Our estimation of success error
probability is based on error probability bound for $t$-wise linearly
independent variables given in \cite{BR94}.

matter candidates which are stable by virtue of a remnant $\mathcal{Z}_2\simeq

3.55 keV. The other role this bitriplet field at TeV scale plays is to assist
in achieving gauge coupling unification at a high energy scale within a

symmetry around the TeV corner. Apart from solving the neutrino mass problem

simultaneously labeling geometric surfaces (e.g. sky, ground and vertical

than the traditional semantic scene labeling, as recovering geometric

achieve these goals, we propose a novel recurrent neural network model, named
Hierarchical Long Short-Term Memory (H-LSTM). It contains two coupled
sub-networks: the Pixel LSTM (P-LSTM) and the Multi-scale Super-pixel LSTM
(MS-LSTM) for handling the surface labeling and relation prediction,
respectively. The two sub-networks provide complementary information to each
other to exploit hierarchical scene contexts, and they are jointly optimized

of QCD dipole-target cross-sections or Wilson line correlators in transverse
position (r) space. They are Bessel transforms of positive transverse momentum
dependent gluon distributions. Using mathematical Fourier-positivity
constraints on the limit r -> 0 behavior of the dipole amplitudes, we identify
the common origin of the violation of Fourier-positivity for various, however
phenomenologically convenient, dipole models. It is due to the behavior
r^{2+epsilon}, epsilon>0, softer, even slightly, than color transparency.
Fourier-positivity seems thus to conflict with the present dipole formalism

variables to achieve simpler versions or even linearized versions of nonlinear
PDEs. These transformations help in the identification of a plethora of PDEs
available in the Physics and Mathematics literature. Two different equations,
although seemingly unrelated, happen to be equivalent versions of a same

probability distributions over states. A probability distribution is
p-synchronizing if the probability mass is at least p in a single state, or in
a given set of states. We consider four temporal synchronizing modes: a
sequence of probability distributions is always p-synchronizing, eventually
p-synchronizing, weakly p-synchronizing, or strongly p-synchronizing if,
respectively, all, some, infinitely many, or all but finitely many
distributions in the sequence are p-synchronizing.
  For each synchronizing mode, an MDP can be (i) sure winning if there is a
strategy that produces a 1-synchronizing sequence; (ii) almost-sure winning if
there is a strategy that produces a sequence that is, for all epsilon > 0, a
(1-epsilon)-synchronizing sequence; (iii) limit-sure winning if for all epsilon

  We provide fundamental results on the expressiveness, decidability, and

we consider the problem of deciding whether an MDP is sure, almost-sure, or

of the problems: for all winning modes, we show that the problems are
PSPACE-complete for eventually and weakly synchronizing, and PTIME-complete for
always and strongly synchronizing. We establish the memory requirement for
winning strategies, and we show that all winning modes coincide for always

former arise from direct activation of targets downstream, and are
straightforward to interpret. The latter are consequence of feedback
connectivity and may reflect a variety of time-scales and complex dynamical
properties. We investigated wide-field photostimulation in cortical networks in
vitro, employing substrate-integrated microelectrode arrays and long-term
cultured neuronal networks. We characterized the effect of brief light pulses,
while restricting the expression of channelrhodopsin to principal neurons. We
evoked robust reverberating responses, oscillating in the physiological gamma
frequency range, and found that such a frequency could be reliably manipulated
varying the light pulse duration, not its intensity. By pharmacology,
mathematical modelling, and intracellular recordings, we conclude that gamma
oscillations likely emerge as in vivo from the excitatory-inhibitory interplay

limited knowledge of the equation of state (EOS) are quantitatively analysed.
We first demonstrate the importance of a unified microscopic description for
the different baryonic densities of the star. If the pressure functional is
obtained matching a crust and a core EOS based on models with different
properties at nuclear matter saturation, the uncertainties can be as large as
$\sim 30\%$ for the crust thickness and $4\%$ for the radius. Necessary
conditions for causal and thermodynamically consistent matchings between the
core and the crust are formulated and their consequences examined. A large set
of unified EOS for purely nucleonic matter is obtained based on 24 Skyrme
interactions and 9 relativistic mean-field nuclear parametrizations. In
addition, for relativistic models 17 EOS including a transition to hyperonic
matter at high density are presented. All these EOS have in common the property
of describing a $2\;M_\odot$ star and of being causal within stable NS. A span
of $\sim 3$ km and $\sim 4$ km is obtained for the radius of, respectively,
$1.0\;M_\odot$ and $2.0\;M_\odot$ star. Applying a set of nine further
constraints from experiment and ab-initio calculations the uncertainty is
reduced to $\sim 1$ km and $2$ km, respectively. These residual uncertainties
reflect lack of constraints at large densities and insufficient information on
the density dependence of the EOS near the nuclear matter saturation point. The
most important parameter to be constrained is shown to be the symmetry energy
slope $L$ which exhibits a linear correlation with the stellar radius,
particularly for masses $\sim 1.0\;M_\odot$. Potential constraints on $L$, the
NS radius and the EOS from observations of thermal states of NS are also

phenomenologically acceptable scenario. After the spontaneous symmetry breaking
$SU(3)_L\times U(1)_X\to SU(2)_L\times U(1)_Y$, our Higgs sector effectively
becomes that with two $SU(2)_L$ doublet scalar fields, in which the first and
the second generation quarks couple to the different Higgs doublet from that
couples to the third generation quarks. This structure causes the flavour
changing neutral current mediated by Higgs bosons at the tree level. By taking
an alignment limit of the mass matrix for the CP-even Higgs bosons, which is
naturally realized in the case with the breaking scale of $SU(3)_L\times
U(1)_X$ to be much larger than that of $SU(2)_L\times U(1)_Y$, we can avoid
current constraints from flavour experiments such as the $B^0$-$\bar{B}^0$
mixing even for the Higgs bosons masses being ${\cal O}(100)$ GeV. In this
allowed parameter space, we clarify that a characteristic deviation in quark
Yukawa couplings of the standard model-like Higgs boson is predicted, which has
a different pattern from that seen in two Higgs doublet models with a
softly-broken $Z_2$ symmetry. We also find that the flavour violating decay
modes of the extra Higgs boson, e.g., $H/A \to tc$ and $H^\pm \to ts$ can be

However, these mechanisms are either intrusive or unfair. In this paper, we use
time-varying rewards to incentivize users, who have flexible deadlines and are
willing to trading performance degradation for monetary rewards, grant
time-shifting of their requests. With a game-theoretic framework, we model the
game between a single data center and its users. Further, we extend our design

improved orbital description compared to other semi-local methods, and
reproduces a band structure closer to higher-order theory. However, its
energies and energetics are inaccurate. The present work further investigates
the deficiency in energetics. In addition to AK13 results, we find that
applying the local-density approximation (LDA) non-self-consistently on the

lattice constants and bulk moduli well described across 14 systems. We also
confirm that the attractive orbital features of AK13 are retained even after
full structural relaxation. Hence, the deficient energetics cannot be a result
of the AK13 orbitals having adversely affected the quality of the electron
density compared to that of usual semi-local functionals; an improved orbital
description and good energetics are not in opposition. We also prove that the
non-self-consistent scheme is equivalent to using a single external-potential

reshaping of a single-photon wave packet in the telecommunication band has been
readily achieved with a modulation bandwidth as large as 0.4 THz. I further
demonstrate that the scheme is applicable to manipulations of a nonclassical
frequency correlation, wave packet interference, and entanglement between two

a polyatomic system with a quadratic T-term Jahn-Teller effect (JTE) from
ultrasound experiments. The method is based on a verified assumption that
ultrasound attenuation and speed encounter anomalies when the direction of
propa- gation and polarization of its wave of strain coincides with the
characteristic directions of symmetry breaking in the JTE. For the SrF2:Cr
crystal, employed as a basic example, we observed anomaly peaks in the
temperature dependence of attenuation of ultrasound at frequencies of 50-160
MHz in the temperature interval of 40-60 K for the wave propagating along the
[110] direction, for both the longitudinal and shear modes, the latter with two
polarizations along the [001] and [110] axes, respectively. We show that these
anomalies are due to the ultrasound relaxation by the system of non-interacting
Cr2+ JT centers with orthorhombic local distortions. The interpretation of the
ex- perimental findings is based on the T2g (eg +t2g) JTE problem including the
linear and quadratic terms of vibronic interactions in the Hamiltonian and the
same-symmetry modes reduced to one interaction mode. Combining the experimental
results with a theoretical analysis we show that on the complicated
six-dimensional APES of this system with three tetragonal, four trigonal, and
six orthorhombic extrema points, the latter are global minima, while the former

departure point is the well known taxation principle. The taxation principle
asserts that every truthful mechanism can be interpreted as follows: every
player is presented with a menu that consists of a price for each bundle (the
prices depend only on the valuations of the other players). Each player is
allocated a bundle that maximizes his profit according to this menu. We define
the taxation complexity of a truthful mechanism to be the logarithm of the
maximum number of menus that may be presented to a player.
  Our main finding is that in general the taxation complexity essentially
equals the communication complexity. The proof consists of two main steps.
First, we prove that for rich enough domains the taxation complexity is at most
the communication complexity. We then show that the taxation complexity is much
smaller than the communication complexity only in ""pathological"" cases and
provide a formal description of these extreme cases.
  Next, we study mechanisms that access the valuations via value queries only.
In this setting we establish that the menu complexity -- a notion that was
already studied in several different contexts -- characterizes the number of
value queries that the mechanism makes in exactly the same way that the
taxation complexity characterizes the communication complexity.
  Our approach yields several applications, including strengthening the
solution concept with low communication overhead, fast computation of prices,
and hardness of approximation by computationally efficient truthful mechanisms.

a tensor network, namely, a multiscale entanglement renormalisation ansatz, and
allows for the efficient computation of local observables and Wilson loops.
Various refinements of the tensor network are discussed leading to several

regulator is removed is then described. This paper is intended as an abstract
for an ongoing programme: there are still many open problems.

analysis because it may use more information from the data than just the block
maxima. In practice, the choice of r is critical. If r is too large, bias can
occur; if too small, the variance of the estimator can be high. The limiting
distribution of the r largest order statistics, denoted by GEVr, extends that
of the block maxima. Two specification tests are proposed to select r
sequentially. The first is a score test for the GEVr distribution. Due to the
special characteristics of the GEVr distribution, the classical chi-square
asymptotics cannot be used. The simplest approach is to use the parametric
bootstrap, which is straightforward to implement but computationally expensive.
An alternative fast weighted bootstrap or multiplier procedure is developed for
computational efficiency. The second test uses the difference in estimated
entropy between the GEVr and GEV(r-1) models, applied to the r largest order
statistics and the r-1 largest order statistics, respectively. The asymptotic
distribution of the difference statistic is derived. In a large scale
simulation study, both tests held their size and had substantial power to
detect various misspecification schemes. A new approach to address the issue of
multiple, sequential hypotheses testing is adapted to this setting to control
the false discovery rate or familywise error rate. The utility of the
procedures is demonstrated with extreme sea level and precipitation data.

luminosity function of galaxies at the epoch of reionization may be
substantially affected due to the combined effect of a diminished role of
minihalos and an enhanced contribution from Pop III stars in atomic cooling
halos. Upcoming results on reionization optical depth from Planck

unique probe of this star formation physical process in minihalos. As a
numerical example, in the absence of significant contributions from minihalos

Gamma-ray LAT catalog (3FGL) includes an unassociated $\gamma$-ray source, 3FGL
J1728.0$-$6446, located close to PKS 1718$-$649. Using the latest Pass 8

$\gamma$-ray source is compatible with the radio location of PKS 1718$-$649.
Cross-matching of the $\gamma$-ray source position with the positions of blazar

We obtain a detection test statistics TS$\sim 36$ ($>$5$\sigma$) with a best

density $F_{\rm 0.1-100GeV}=$(11.5$\pm$0.3)$\times{\rm 10^{-9}}$ ph cm$^{-2}$

ideal candidate for $\gamma$-ray detection in the framework of the model
proposing that the most compact and the youngest CSOs can efficiently produce
GeV radiation via inverse-Compton scattering of the ambient photon fields by
the radio lobe non-thermal electrons. Thus, our detection of the source in
$\gamma$-rays establishes young radio galaxies as a distinct class of
extragalactic high-energy emitters, and yields an unique insight on the
physical conditions in compact radio lobes interacting with the interstellar

CopulaDTA package in R to fit different models to obtain the meta-analytic
parameter estimates. The focus is on the joint modelling of sensitivity and

which offers flexibility and ability to perform complex statistical modelling

providing an easy to use code. The statistical methods are illustrated by
re-analysing data of two published meta-analyses. Modelling sensitivity and
specificity using the bivariate beta distribution provides marginal as well as
study-specific parameter estimates as opposed to using bivariate normal
distribution (e.g., in BRMA) which only yields study-specific parameter
estimates. Moreover, copula based models offer greater flexibility in modelling
different correlation structures in contrast to the normal distribution which
allows for only one correlation structure.

emitted soon after the BB, that will reach later observers with finite
blueshift ($-1 < z < 0$). But in spacetimes without symmetry there are no
radial directions. The question thus arises whether blueshifts can exist at all
in the Szekeres models that contain L--T as a limit, but in general have no
symmetry. The aim of the present paper is to show that strong blueshifts can be
generated in quasi-spherical Szekeres (QSS) models. It is shown that in an
axially symmetric QSS model, infinite blueshift can appear only on axial rays,
which intersect every space orthogonal to the dust flow on the symmetry axis.
In an exemplary QSS model it is numerically shown that if such a ray is emitted
from the Big Bang where $\dril {t_B} r \neq 0$, then indeed observers see it
with $z \approx -1$. Rays emitted shortly after the BB and running close to the
symmetry axis will reach the observers with a strong blueshift, too. Then, in a
toy QSS model that has no symmetry, it was shown by numerical calculations that
two null lines exist such that rays in their vicinity have redshift profiles
similar to those in a vicinity of the axial rays in the axially symmetric case.
This indicates that rays generating infinite blueshifts exist in general QSS

the stability of traffic queues in parallel-link transportation systems facing

model switches between a finite set of modes according to a Markov chain, and
link inflows are controlled by a state-feedback policy. A PDQ system is stable
only if a lower bound on the time-average link inflows does not exceed the
corresponding time-average saturation rate. Furthermore, a PDQ system is stable
if the following two conditions hold: the nominal mode's saturation rate is
high enough that all queues vanish in this mode, and a bilinear matrix
inequality (BMI) involving an underestimate of the discharge rates of the PDQ
in individual modes is feasible. The stability conditions can be strengthened
for two-mode PDQs. These results can be used for design of routing policies

networks provide a limited representation of complex systems, which often
include different types of relationships (i.e., ""multiplexity"") among their
constituent components and/or multiple interacting subsystems. Such structural
complexity has a significant effect on both dynamics and function. Throwing
away or aggregating available structural information can generate misleading

  The recent ""multilayer"" approach for modeling networked systems explicitly
allows the incorporation of multiplexity and other features of realistic

demonstrate the important role of nonlocal interactions and dynamical screening

threshold-based approaches. Under suitable conditions, exceedances over a high
threshold have been shown to follow the generalized Pareto distribution (GPD)
asymptotically. In practice, however, the threshold must be chosen. If the
chosen threshold is too low, the GPD approximation may not hold and bias can
occur. If the threshold is chosen too high, reduced sample size increases the
variance of parameter estimates. To process batch analyses, commonly used
selection methods such as graphical diagnosis are subjective and cannot be
automated, while computational methods may not be feasible. We propose to test
a set of thresholds through the goodness-of-fit of the GPD for the exceedances,
and select the lowest one, above which the data provides adequate fit to the
GPD. Previous attempts in this setting are not valid due to the special feature
that the multiple tests are done in an ordered fashion. We apply two recently
available stopping rules that control the false discovery rate or familywise
error rate to ordered goodness-of-fit tests to automate threshold selection.
Various model specification tests such as the Cramer-von Mises,
Anderson-Darling, Moran's, and a score test are investigated. The performance
of the method is assessed in a large scale simulation study that mimics
practical return level estimation. This procedure was repeated at hundreds of
sites in the western US to generate return level maps of extreme precipitation.

robust D-stability analysis, which aims at verifying if all the eigenvalues of
an uncertain matrix lie in a given region D of the complex plane. Robust
D-stability analysis is an NP-hard problem and many polynomial-time algorithms
providing either sufficient or necessary conditions for an uncertain matrix to
be robustly D-stable have been developed in the past decades. Despite the vast
literature on the subject, most of the contributions consider specific families
of uncertain matrices, mainly with interval or polytopic uncertainty. In this
work, we present a novel approach providing sufficient conditions to verify if
a family of matrices, whose entries depend polynomially on some uncertain
parameters, is robustly D-stable. The only assumption on the stability region D
is that its complement is a semialgebraic set described by polynomial
constraints, which comprises the main important cases in stability analysis.
Furthermore, the D-stability analysis problem is formulated in a probabilistic
framework. In this context, the uncertain parameters characterizing the
considered family of matrices are described by a set of non a priori specified
probability measures. Only the support and some of the moments (e.g., expected
values) are assumed to be known and, among all possible probability measures,
we seek the one which provides the minimum probability of D-stability. The
robust and the probabilistic D-stability analysis problems are formulated in a
unified framework, and relaxations based on the theory of moments are used to
solve the D-stability analysis problem through convex optimization. Application
to robustness and probabilistic analysis of dynamical systems is discussed.

Both the free-hand case, in which the hand is isolated from the surrounding

proposed framework uses a ""pure"" point cloud as provided by the Kinect sensor

technipion $\tilde{\pi}^0$. We consider two distinct minimal models for the
dynamical electroweak symmetry breaking. In a first one, two-flavor vector-like
technicolor (VTC) model, we assume that the two-photon fusion is a dominant
production mechanism. We include $\gamma \gamma \to {\tilde \pi}^0$ and
production of technipion associated with one or two jets. All the considered
mechanisms give similar contributions. With the strong Yukawa
(technipion-techniquark) coupling $g_{TC}$ = 10 - 20 we obtain the measured
cross section of the ""signal"". With such values of $g_{TC}$ we get a relatively
small $\Gamma_{\rm tot}$. In a second approach, one-family walking technicolor
(WTC) model, the isoscalar technipion is produced dominantly via the
gluon-gluon fusion. We also discuss the size of the signal at lower energies
(LHC, Tevatron) for $\gamma \gamma$ (VTC) and jet-jet (WTC) final states and
check consistency with the existing experimental data. We predict a measurable
cross section for ${\tilde \pi}^0$ production associated with one or two soft
jets. The technipion signal in both models is compared with the SM background
diphoton contributions. We observe the dominance of inelastic-inelastic
processes for $\gamma \gamma$ induced processes. In the VTC scenario, we
predict the signal cross section for purely exclusive $p p \to p p \gamma
\gamma$ processes at $\sqrt{s}$ = 13 TeV to be about 0.2 fb. Such a cross
section would be, however, difficult to measure with the planned integrated
luminosity. In all considered cases the signal is below the background or/and
below the threshold set by statistics.

Ba$_3$(FeSe$_4$)Br. These compounds consist of edge-sharing Ba$Q_6$ ($Q$=Cl or
Br) octahedra intercalated with isolated Fe$X_4$ ($X$=S or Se) tetrahedra. We
find that even though the shortest distances between the nearest-neighboring Fe
atoms in these three compounds already exceed 6 \AA, much larger than the bond
length of a chemical bonding, they all remarkably show antiferromagnetic (AFM)
coupling along $b$ axis with very weak spin-spin correlation along $a$ axis.
Our study shows that the mechanism underlying this novel AFM coupling is such a
new type of exchange interaction between the nearest-neighboring Fe-based
super-moments mediated by Ba cations, which we call the super-super exchange
interaction, in which each magnetic Fe atom partially polarizes its four
nearest-neighboring $X$ atoms to form a super-moment through $p$-$d$ orbital
hybridization and the $X$ atoms in neighboring Fe$X_4$ tetrahedra along $b$
axis antiferromagnetically couple with each others through the intermediate Ba
cations. Different from the conventional superexchange, here it is cations
rather than anions that mediate two neighboring super-moments. According to the
calculated strength of the AFM coupling, we predict that among these compounds
the highest AFM phase transition temperature $T_N$ may reach 110 K in

relevant timescales some particles diffuse much faster than the average or than

unambiguously identify slow particles. Their diffusivity is even less than

characterizing quantum states. However it requires that the original global
state be uniquely determined (UD) by its local reduced density matrices (RDMs).
In this work we demonstrate for the first time a class of states that are UD by
their RDMs under the assumption that the global state is pure, but fail to be
UD in the absence of that assumption. This discovery allows us to classify
quantum states according to their UD properties, with the requirement that each
class be treated distinctly in the practice of simplifying quantum state
tomography. Additionally we experimentally test the feasibility and stability
of performing quantum state tomography via the measurement of local RDMs for
each class. These theoretical and experimental results advance the project of
performing efficient and accurate quantum state tomography in practice.

(PCA) rank-reduction preprocessing step is commonly performed before applying
canonical correlation analysis (CCA). We present simple, yet very effective
approaches to the joint model-order selection of the number of dimensions that

These approaches are based on reduced-rank versions of the Bartlett-Lawley

small sample sizes even in colored noise.

Galactic scale flows as the ISM passes through spiral shocks. We use the
Lagrangian nature of SPH simulations to trace how the star forming gas is
gathered into self-gravitating cores that collapse to form stars. Large scale
flows that arise due to Galactic dynamics create shocks of order 30 km/s that
compress the gas and form dense clouds $(n> $several $\times 10^2$ cm$^{-3}$)
in which self-gravity becomes relevant. These large-scale flows are necessary
for creating the dense physical conditions for gravitational collapse and star
formation. Local gravitational collapse requires densities in excess of
$n>10^3$ cm$^{-3}$ which occur on size scales of $\approx 1$ pc for low-mass
star forming regions ($M<100 M_{\odot}$), and up to sizes approaching 10 pc for
higher-mass regions ($M>10^3 M_{\odot}$). Star formation in the 250 pc region
lasts throughout the 5 Myr timescale of the simulation with a star formation
rate of $\approx 10^{-1} M_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$ kpc$^{-2}$. In the absence of
feedback, the efficiency of the star formation per free-fall time varies from
our assumed 100 % at our sink accretion radius to values of $< 10^{-3}$ at low

nonequilibrium is an open challenge for computational many-particle methods:
the numerical requirement of using a finite number of lead levels and the
physical requirement of describing a truly open quantum system are seemingly
incompatible. One possibility to bridge this gap is the use of Lindblad-driven
discretized leads (LDDL): one couples auxiliary continuous reservoirs to the
discretized lead levels and represents these additional reservoirs by Lindblad
terms in the Liouville equation. For quadratic models governed by Lindbladian
dynamics, we present an elementary approach for obtaining correlation functions
analytically. In a second part, we use this approach to explicitly discuss the
conditions under which the continuum limit of the LDDL approach recovers the
correct representation of thermal reservoirs. As an analytically solvable
example, the nonequilibrium resonant level model is studied in greater detail.
Lastly, we present ideas towards a numerical evaluation of the suggested
Lindblad equation for interacting impurities based on matrix product states. In
particular, we present a reformulation of the Lindblad equation, which has the
useful property that the leads can be mapped onto a chain where both the
Hamiltonian dynamics and the Lindblad driving are local at the same time.
Moreover, we discuss the possibility to combine the Lindblad approach with a
logarithmic discretization needed for the exploration of exponentially small
energy scales.

corresponding to changes in the underlying organizational dynamics. In
particular, it is of interest in understanding changes in attributes such as
intentions/ideology, tactics/strategies, capabilities/resources, etc., that
influence and impact the activity. The goal of this work is the quick detection
of such changes and in general, tracking of macroscopic as well as microscopic
trends in group dynamics. Prior work in this area are based on parametric
approaches and rely on time-series analysis techniques, self-exciting hurdle
models (SEHM), or hidden Markov models (HMM). While these approaches detect
spurts and downfalls reasonably accurately, they are all based on model
learning --- a task that is difficult in practice because of the ""rare"" nature
of terrorist attacks from a model learning perspective. In this paper, we
pursue an alternate non-parametric approach for spurt detection in activity
profiles. Our approach is based on binning the count data of terrorist activity
to form observation vectors that can be compared with each other. Motivated by
a majorization theory framework, these vectors are then transformed via certain
functionals and used in spurt classification. While the parametric approaches
often result in either a large number of missed detections of real changes or
false alarms of unoccurred changes, the proposed approach is shown to result in
a small number of missed detections and false alarms. Further, the
non-parametric nature of the approach makes it attractive for ready
applications in a practical context.

importance of the ratio of surface stress to an elastic modulus, which defines
a length scale below which surface stresses can dominate.

sub-scaling, nominal scaling, or super-scaling. Super-scaling homologues most
efficiently take advantage of increased size. We apply our approach to data
currently available in the literature to identify the best super-scaling
molecular paradigms with the aim of identifying desirable traits of new
materials.

interaction BD potential $V(\phi)$ and perfect fluid matter field action we
solve corresponding field equations via dynamical system approach for flat
Friedmann Robertson Walker metric (FRW). We obtained 3 type critical points for
$\Lambda CDM$ vacuum de Sitter era where stability of our solutions are
depended to choose particular values of BD parameter $\omega.$ One of these
fixed points is supported by a constant potential which is stable for
$\omega<0$ and behaves as saddle (quasi stable) for $\omega\geq0.$ Two other
ones are supported by a linear potential $V(\phi)\sim\phi$ which one of them is
stable for $\omega=0.27647.$ For a fixed value of $\omega$ there is at least 2
out of 3 critical points reaching to a unique critical point. Namely for
$\omega=-0.16856(-0.56038)$ the second (third) critical point become unique
with the first critical point. In dust and radiation eras we obtained 1
critical point which never become unique fixed point. In the latter case
coordinates of fixed points are also depended to $\omega.$ To determine
stability of our solutions we calculate eigenvalues of Jacobi matrix of 4D
phase space dynamical field equations for de Sitter, dust and radiation eras.
We should be point also potentials which support dust and radiation eras must
be similar to $V(\phi)\sim\phi^{-\frac{1}{2}}$ and $V(\phi)\sim\phi^{-1}$
respectively. In short our study predicts that radiation and dust eras of our
VBD-FRW cosmology transmit to stable de Sitter state via non-constant potential
(effective variable cosmological parameter) by choosing $\omega=0.27647$.

  Recall",,,,,"q-bio.OT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  I find that the total retrieval time in word free recall increases linearly
with the total number of items recalled. Measured slopes, the time to retrieve
an additional item, vary from 1.4-4.5 seconds per item depending upon
presentation rate, subject age and whether there is a delay after list
presentation or not. These times to retrieve an additional item obey a second
linear relationship as a function of the recall probability averaged over the
experiment, explicitly independent of subject age, presentation rate and
whether there is a delay after the list presentation or not. This second linear
relationship mimics the relationships in recognition and cued recall (Tarnow,
2008) which suggests that free recall retrieval uses the same reactivation
mechanism as recognition or cued recall. Extrapolation limits the time to
retrieve an additional item to a maximum of 7.2 seconds per item if the
probability of recall is near 0%. Earlier upper limits for recognition and cued
recall varied with the item type between 0.2 and 1.8 seconds per item (Tarnow,
2008). Implications include that there are only two types of short term memory:
working memory and reactivation.

  Free Recall",,,,,"q-bio.OT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Recently it was shown that free recall consists of two stages: the first few
recalls empty the working memory and a second stage concludes the recall
(Tarnow, 2015; for a review of the theoretical prediction see Murdock, 1974).
It is commonly believed that a delay with a task before the recall starts
removes the content of working memory (Glanzer & Cunitz, 1966). Here is
presented the first direct evidence that this is indeed the case.

"1605.05688","Eugen Tarnow","Regina Ershova, Eugen Tarnow","A Precise Measure of Working Memory Reveals Subjects Difficulties
  Managing Limited Capacity",,,,,"q-bio.OT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Free recall consists of two separate stages: the emptying of working memory
and reactivation [1]. The Tarnow Unchunkable Test (TUT, [2]) uses double
integer items to separate out only the first stage by making it difficult to
reactivate items due to the lack of intra-item relationships. 193 Russian
college students were tested via the internet version of the TUT. The average
number of items remembered in the 3 item test was 2.54 items. In the 4 item
test, the average number of items decreased to 2.38. This, and a number of
other qualitative distribution differences between the 3 and 4 item tests,
indicates that the average capacity limit of working memory has been reached at
3 items. This provides the first direct measurement of the unchunkable capacity
limit of language based items. That the average number of items remembered
decreased as the number of items increased from 3 to 4 indicates that most
subjects were unable to manage their working memories as the number of items
increased just beyond the average capacity. Further evidence for the difficulty
in managing the capacity limit is that 25% of subjects could not remember any
items correctly at least in one of three 4 item tests and that the Pearson
correlation between the 3 item and 4 item subject recalls was a relatively
small 38%. This failure of managing a basic memory resource should have
important consequences for pedagogy including instruction, text book design and
test design. Because working memory scores are important for academic
achievement, it also suggests that an individual can gain academically by
learning how to manage her or his capacity limit.
