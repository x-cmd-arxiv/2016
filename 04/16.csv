real, scalar singlet field, including applicability to a dark matter (DM) model
with the addition of a Yukawa coupling to a Dirac fermion. The collider
signatures and constraints on the mixed two-Higgs scenario are determined,
including limits from Higgs production signals and exclusion searches, as well
as constraints arising from the Higgs total and invisible widths. As there is
overwhelming Higgs data which is consistent with a SM scenario, the case in
which an additional scalar has evaded detection is further explored in the
context of Higgs precision measurement. The discovery reach and prospective
signatures of the model at a proposed linear collider are investigated, with
particular focus on the Higgs triple coupling, and di-Higgs production
processes.

  structure is small",,,,,"q-bio.PE","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  When controlling an emerging outbreak of an infectious disease it is
essential to know the key epidemiological parameters, such as the basic
reproduction number $R_0$ and the control effort required to prevent a large
outbreak. These parameters are estimated from the observed incidence of new
cases and information about the infectious contact structures of the population
in which the disease spreads. However, the relevant infectious contact
structures for new, emerging infections are often unknown or hard to obtain.
Here we show that for many common true underlying heterogeneous contact
structures, the simplification to neglect such structures and instead assume
that all contacts are made homogeneously in the whole population, results in
conservative estimates for $R_0$ and the required control effort. This means
that robust control policies can be planned during the early stages of an
outbreak, using such conservative estimates of the required control effort.

be detectable, which in turn requires new light force carriers. We account for
such new forces explicitly, by introducing a mediator particle with scalar or
vector couplings to dark matter and to electrons. We then perform state of the

aspect of the problem (e.g., the relativistic effects, which can be quite

mediator mass, and the effective coupling strength, to see if there is any part

of the labelled transition relation. Our main contributions are proofs of the
""diamond lemma"" for the residuals of concurrent transitions and a formal
definition of equivalence of traces up to permutation of transitions.
  In the pi-calculus transitions represent propagating binders whenever their
actions involve bound names. To accommodate these cases, we require a more
general diamond lemma where the target states of equivalent traces are no
longer identical, but are related by a braiding that rewires the bound and free
names to reflect the particular interleaving of events involving binders. Our
approach may be useful for modelling concurrency in other languages where
transitions carry metadata sensitive to particular interleavings, such as
dynamically allocated memory addresses.

lumped element circuitry, where optical elements act as effective optical
inductors, capacitors, and resistors. Such optical circuitry requires the
photonic equivalent of electrical wires, structures able carry optical
frequency signals to and from the lumped circuit elements while simultaneously
maintaining signal carrier wavelengths much larger than the size of the lumped
elements. Here we demonstrate the design, fabrication, and characterization of
hybrid metal/doped-semiconductor 'photonic wires' operating at optical
frequencies with effective indices of propagation near-zero. Our samples are
characterized by polarization and angle-dependent FTIR spectroscopy and modeled
by finite element methods and rigorous coupled wave analysis. We demonstrate
coupling to such photonic wires from free space, and show the effective
wavelength of the excited mode to be approximately an order of magnitude larger
than the free-space wavelength of our light. The operational length of the
photonic wires approaches twice the free space wavelength, significantly longer
than what is achievable with bulk epsilon near zero materials. The novel
architecture utilized in our hybrid waveguides allows for significant design
flexibility by control of the semiconductor material's optical properties and
the sample geometry. In addition, by utilizing a semiconductor-based
architecture, our photonic wires can be designed to monolithically integrate
the optical equivalents of capacitive, inductive, and resistive lumped circuit
elements, as well optoelectronic sources and detectors. As such, the
demonstrated photonic wires have the potential to provide a key component, and
a realistic framework, for the development of optical circuitry.

One is a fixed-power charging station purchasing electricity from the grid at
wholesale price and reselling the energy to EV owners at a higher retail price;
the other is regulation-providing and varies the recharging power level of its
clients to provide regulation services to the grid, so its profit comes from
both EV owners (who buy energy) and the grid (which pays for regulation
services). Users are reluctant to charging power variations and prefer shorter
overall charging times, hence regulation-providing charging has to be cheaper
than fixed-power charging.
  We analyze the competition among those charging providers, and examine the
performance at the equilibrium in terms of user welfare, station revenue and
electricity prices. As expected, competing stations provide users with lower
charging prices than when both charging solutions are offered by a monopolistic
provider. Moreover, while competition benefits users, it also benefits the grid
in that the amount of regulation services increases significantly with respect

investigating protoplanetary disks central regions. A key factor governing the
conditions near the star is the silicate sublimation front, which largely
determines where the starlight is absorbed, and which is often called the inner
rim. We present the first radiation hydrodynamical modeling of the sublimation
front in the disks around the young intermediate-mass stars called Herbig Ae
stars. The models are axisymmetric, and include starlight heating, silicate
grains sublimating and condensing to equilibrium at the local, time-dependent
temperature and density, and accretion stresses parametrizing the results of
MHD magneto-rotational turbulence models. The results compare well with
radiation hydrostatic solutions, and prove to be dynamically stable. Passing
the model disks into Monte Carlo radiative transfer calculations, we show that
the models satisfy observational constraints on the inner rims location. A
small optically-thin halo of hot dust naturally arises between the inner rim
and the star. The inner rim has a substantial radial extent, corresponding to
several disk scale heights. While the fronts overall position varies with the
stellar luminosity, its radial extent depends on the mass accretion rate. A
pressure maximum develops near the location of thermal ionization at
temperatures about 1000 K. The pressure maximum is capable of halting solid
pebbles radial drift and concentrating them in a zone where temperatures are
sufficiently high for annealing to form crystalline silicates.

  Offline: The queries are chosen all at once and the differentially private

  Online: The queries are chosen all at once, but the mechanism only receives

depend on the answers given to previous queries.
  Many differentially private mechanisms are just as efficient in the adaptive

differential privacy hold in the offline setting. This suggests that the three
models may be equivalent.

giant galaxies are associated with rising X-ray bubbles inflated by radio jets

condense from low entropy gas caught in the updraft of rising X-ray bubbles.
The low entropy gas becomes thermally unstable when it is lifted to an altitude
where its cooling time is shorter than the time required to fall to its
equilibrium location in the galaxy i.e., t_c/t_I < 1. The infall speed of a
cloud is bounded by the lesser of its free-fall and terminal speeds, so that
the infall time here can exceed the the free-fall time by a significant factor.
This mechanism is motivated by ALMA observations revealing molecular clouds
lying in the wakes of rising X-ray bubbles with velocities well below their
free-fall speeds. Our mechanism would provide cold gas needed to fuel a
feedback loop while stabilizing the atmosphere on larger scales. The observed
cooling time threshold of ~ 5x 10^8 yr --- the clear-cut signature of thermal
instability and the onset of nebular emission and star formation--- may result
from the limited ability of radio bubbles to lift low entropy gas to altitudes
where thermal instabilities can ensue. Outflowing molecular clouds are unlikely
to escape, but instead return to the central galaxy in a circulating flow. We
contrast our mechanism to precipitation models where the minimum value of
t_c/t_ff < 10 triggers thermal instability, which we find to be inconsistent
with observation.

independent constraints on cosmological parameters that are necessary to obtain

suggest possible systematic overestimation of SNIa luminosity distances

centralized - promise the best of two worlds: programmability and agility of
SDN, and reliability and fault tolerance of distributed routing protocols like
OSPF. The common approaches follow a division of labor concept, where SDN
controls prioritized traffic and OSPF assures care-free operation of best
effort traffic. We propose SDN Partitioning, which establishes centralized
control over the distributed routing protocol by partitioning the topology into
sub-domains with SDN-enabled border nodes, such that OSPF's routing updates
have to traverse SDN border nodes to reach neighboring sub-domains. This allows
the central controller to modify how sub-domains view one another, which in
turn allows to steer inter-sub-domain traffic. The degree of dynamic control
against simplicity of OSPF can be trade off by adjusting the size of the
sub-domains. This paper explains the technical requirements, presents a novel
scheme for balanced topology partitioning, and provides the models for common
network management tasks. Our performance evaluation shows that - already in
its minimum configuration with two sub-domains - SDN Partitioning provides
significant improvements in all respects compared to legacy routing protocols,
whereas smaller sub-domains provide network control capabilities comparable to
full SDN deployment.

considerable time at low temperatures while subsequent dust growth occurs
during the descending part of the motion and continues after the next shock
reversed motion. It is found that sufficient dust forms that radiation pressure
exceeds gravitational pull of the stars such that the mass element is finally
driven out of the star. Nucleation of dust particles by clustering of the
abundant SiO molecules could be the mechanism that triggers silicate dust
formation in Miras.

problem \[ x \in L \cap K \setminus\{0\}. \] Here $K\subseteq V$ is a regular
convex cone and $L\subseteq V$ is a linear subspace of the finite dimensional
Euclidean vector space $V$. The Grassmann condition of this problem is the
reciprocal of the distance from $L$ to the set of ill-posed instances in the
Grassmann manifold where $L$ lives.
  We consider a very general distance in the Grassmann manifold defined by two
possibly different norms in $V$. We establish the equivalence between the
Grassmann distance to ill-posedness of the above problem and a natural measure
of the least violated trial solution to its alternative feasibility problem. We
also show a tight relationship between the Grassmann and Renegar's condition
measures, and between the Grassman measure and a symmetry measure of the above
feasibility problem.
  Our approach can be readily specialized to a canonical norm in $V$ induced by
$K$, a prime example being the one-norm for the non-negative orthant. For this
special case we show that the Grassmann distance ill-posedness of is equivalent
to a measure of the most interior solution to the above conic feasibility

distributed method-execution events and inferring causality from the ordered
events, DISTEA can predict impacts propagated both within and across process

evaluated the precision and practical usefulness of DISTEA, and demonstrated
its application in program comprehension, through two case studies. The results

  To more naturally reflect exploration when debating numerous models, we
propose an interactive model construction framework grounded in composable

composite operations enable advanced model families, both generic and
specialized, abstracted away from low-level details.

the probabilistic protocol increases considerably the fidelity of the
teleported state, without decreasing the probability of a successful run of the
protocol. Also, there are cases where the entanglement of the channel
connecting Alice and Bob leading to the greatest fidelity is not maximal.
Moreover, there exist cases where the optimal fidelity for the probabilistic
protocols are greater than the maximal fidelity (2/3) achievable by using only
classical resources, while the optimal ones for the deterministic protocols
under the same conditions lie below this limit. This result clearly illustrates
that in some cases we can only get a truly quantum teleportation if we use

local quantum wells stemming from disorder in the environment and 2) exciton
thermalization between dark and bright states due to intratube scattering. The
SWNT excitonic states are calculated by solving the Bethe-Salpeter equation
using tight-binding basis functions. The ET rates due to intertube Coulomb
interaction are computed via Fermi's golden rule. In pristine samples, the ET
rate between parallel (bundled) SWNTs of similar chirality is very high ($\sim
10^{14}\;\text{s}^{-1}$) while the ET rate for dissimilar or nonparallel tubes
is considerably lower ($\sim 10^{12}\;\text{s}^{-1}$). Exciton confinement
reduces the ET rate between same-chirality parallel SWNTs by two orders of
magnitude, but has little effect otherwise. Consequently, the ET rate in most
measurements will be on the order of $ 10^{12}\;\text{s}^{-1}$, regardless of
the tube relative orientation or chirality. Exciton thermalization between
bright and dark states further reduces the ET rate to about
$10^{11}\;\text{s}^{-1}$. The ET rate also increases with increasing
temperature and decreases with increasing dielectric constant of the
surrounding medium.

investigates a surface capable of morphing its shape using an array of linear

effects of wind speed on an airplane's performance and stability. No framework
exists in AI that allows this kind of methodical manipulation: Performance
results on the few tasks in current use (cf. board games, question-answering)
cannot be easily compared, however similar or different. The issue is even more
acute with respect to artificial *general* intelligence systems, which must
handle unanticipated tasks whose specifics cannot be known beforehand. A *task
theory* would enable addressing tasks at the *class* level, bypassing their
specifics, providing the appropriate formalization and classification of tasks,

measuring, comparing, and evaluating intelligent behavior. Even modest
improvements in this direction would surpass the current ad-hoc nature of

redeploy and expand the framework of Desmond & Wechsler (2015) to ask whether
abundance matching-based LCDM models that have shown success in matching the
spatial distribution of galaxies are also capable of explaining key properties
of the FJR and FP, including their scatter. Within our framework, agreement
with the normalisation of the FJR requires haloes to expand in response to disc
formation. We find that the tilt of the FP may be explained by a combination of
the observed non-homology in galaxy structure and the variation in
mass-to-light ratio produced by abundance matching with a universal initial
mass function (IMF), provided that the anisotropy of stellar motions is taken
into account. However, the predicted scatter around the FP is considerably
increased by situating galaxies in cosmologically-motivated haloes due to
variations in halo properties at fixed stellar mass, and appears to exceed that
of the data. This implies that additional correlations between galaxy and halo
variables may be required to fully reconcile these models with elliptical
galaxy scaling relations.

tissue types and tumors in medical images is a necessary measurement that
suffers from multiple problems. One major shortcoming of all accuracy measures
is that they neglect the anatomical significance or relevance of different
zones within a given segment. Hence, existing accuracy metrics measure the
overlap of a given segment with a ground-truth without any anatomical
discrimination inside the segment. For instance, if we understand the rectal
wall or urethral sphincter as anatomical zones, then current accuracy measures
ignore their significance when they are applied to assess the quality of the
prostate gland segments. In this paper, we propose an anatomy-aware measurement
scheme for segmentation accuracy of medical images. The idea is to create a
``master gold'' based on a consensus shape containing not just the outline of
the segment but also the outlines of the internal zones if existent or
relevant. To apply this new approach to accuracy measurement, we introduce the
anatomy-aware extensions of both Dice coefficient and Jaccard index and
investigate their effect using 500 synthetic prostate ultrasound images with 20
different segments for each image. We show that through anatomy-sensitive
calculation of segmentation accuracy, namely by considering relevant anatomical
zones, not only the measurement of individual users can change but also the
ranking of users' segmentation skills may require reordering.

release of molecules as information carriers. Communication via molecular
diffusion is a popular strategy that is ubiquitous in nature and very fast over
distances on the order of a micron or less. Existing closed-form analysis of
the diffusion channel impulse response generally assumes that the transmitter
is a point source. In this paper, channel impulse responses are derived for
spherical transmitters with either a passive or absorbing receiver. The derived
channel impulse responses are in closed-form for a one-dimensional environment
and can be found via numerical integration for a three-dimensional environment.
The point transmitter assumption (PTA) is formally defined so that its accuracy
can be measured in comparison to the derived spherical transmitter impulse
responses. The spherical transmitter model is much more accurate than the PTA
when the distance between a transmitter and its receiver is small relative to
the size of the transmitter. The derived results are verified via microscopic
particle-based simulations using the molecular communication simulation
platform AcCoRD (Actor-based Communication via Reaction-Diffusion). A spherical
transmitter variation where molecules are released from the surface of a solid
sphere is also considered via simulation.

rigorously its uniform error bounds for the Zakharov system (ZS) with a
dimensionless parameter $0<\varepsilon\le 1$, which is inversely proportional
to the speed of sound. In the subsonic limit regime, i.e., $0<\varepsilon\ll
1$, the solution propagates highly oscillatory waves and/or rapid outgoing
initial layers due to the perturbation of the wave operator in ZS and/or the
incompatibility of the initial data which is characterized by two nonnegative
parameters $\alpha$ and $\beta$. Specifically, the solution propagates waves
with $O(\varepsilon)$- and $O(1)$-wavelength in time and space, respectively,
and amplitude at $O(\varepsilon^{\min\{2,\alpha,1+\beta\}})$ and
$O(\varepsilon^\alpha)$ for well-prepared ($\alpha\ge1$) and ill-prepared

solution in time brings significant difficulties in designing numerical methods
and establishing their error bounds, especially in the subsonic limit regime. A
uniformly accurate finite difference method is proposed by reformulating ZS
into an asymptotic consistent formulation and adopting an integral
approximation of the oscillatory term. By adapting the energy method and using
the limiting equation via a nonlinear Schr\""{o}dinger equation with an
oscillatory potential, we rigorously establish two independent error bounds and
obtain error bounds at $O(h^2+\tau^{4/3})$ and
$O(h^2+\tau^{1+\frac{\alpha}{2+\alpha}})$ for well-prepared and ill-prepared
initial data, respectively, which are uniform in both space and time for

linearly but radial velocity, normal stresses and the component of couple
stress are independent of z. The micropolarity-effects on discharge diminish if
the diameter of jet-source reduces. Analogous to the plane-jet-flow [8],
teace(stress tensor)=0, for the micropolar as well as for the Newtonian fluids.
The normal stresses decreases as r goes on increasing, analogous to the

vanish. The couple stress tensor is symmetric and skew-symmetric if analogous

arbitrary context-free grammars while being both easy to understand and simple
to implement. Despite much initial enthusiasm and a multitude of independent
implementations, its worst-case complexity has never been proven to be better

symmetry to protect its longevity, but could decay into standard model
particles due to gravitational loop corrections. The radiative corrections can
lead to both higher- and lower-dimensional effective operators. We also first
explore how DM can be produced in the early universe. Through gravitational
interaction at high temperature, DM is then found to have mass around TeV
$\lesssim m_X \lesssim 10^{11}$GeV to get the right relic abundance. When DM
decays, it mostly decays into gravitons, which could be tested by current and
future CMB experiments. We also estimate the resulting fluxes for cosmic rays,
gamma-ray and neutrino.

changes the evolution of the Schwarzschild-Tangherlini black hole. Specially,
the GUP effect becomes susceptible when the radius or mass of the black hole
approaches the order of Planck scale, it stops radiating and leads to black

field (SCF) iterations and thus the overall computational cost of
Born-Oppenheimer molecular dynamics (BOMD) that is based on the Kohn-Sham
density functional theory. Going against the intuition that the higher order of
extrapolation possesses a better accuracy, we demonstrate, from both
theoretical and numerical perspectives, that the extrapolation accuracy firstly
increases and then decreases with respect to the order, and an optimal
extrapolation order in terms of minimal number of SCF iterations always exists.
We also prove that the optimal order tends to be larger when using larger MD
time steps or more strict SCF convergence criteria. By example BOMD simulations
of a solid copper system, we show that the optimal extrapolation order covers a
broad range when varying the MD time step or the SCF convergence criterion.
Therefore, we suggest the necessity for BOMD simulation packages to open the
user interface and to provide more choices on the extrapolation order. Another
factor that may influence the extrapolation accuracy is the alignment scheme
that eliminates the discontinuity in the wavefunctions with respect to the
atomic or cell variables. We prove the equivalence between the two existing
schemes, thus the implementation of either of them does not lead to essential
difference in the extrapolation accuracy.

of the approaches to this issue is using one of the internal degrees of freedom
as a time variable. The objective of our research was to check whether a scalar
field or any other dynamical quantity being a part of a coupled multi-component
matter-geometry system can be treated as a `clock' during its evolution. We
investigated a collapse of a self-gravitating electrically charged scalar field
in the Einstein and Brans-Dicke theories using the 2+2 formalism. Our findings
concentrated on the spacetime region of high curvature existing in the vicinity
of the emerging singularity, which is essential for the quantum gravity
applications. We investigated several values of the Brans-Dicke coupling
constant and the coupling between the Brans-Dicke and the electrically charged
scalar fields. It turned out that both evolving scalar fields and a function
which measures the amount of electric charge within a sphere of a given radius
can be used to quantify time nearby the singularity in the dynamical spacetime
part, in which the apparent horizon surrounding the singularity is spacelike.
Using them in this respect in the asymptotic spacetime region is possible only
when both fields are present in the system and, moreover, they are coupled to
each other. The only nonzero component of the Maxwell field four-potential
cannot be used to quantify time during the considered process in the
neighborhood of the whole central singularity. None of the investigated
dynamical quantities is a good candidate for measuring time nearby the Cauchy
horizon, which is also singular due to the mass inflation phenomenon.

pedagogical effectiveness and the fact that, in labour contexts, enterprises
organize their employees in teams to carry out complex projects. Despite its
crucial importance in the classroom and industry, there is a lack of support
for the team formation process. Not only do many factors influence team
performance, but the problem becomes exponentially costly if teams are to be
optimized. In this article, we propose a tool whose aim it is to cover such a
gap. It combines artificial intelligence techniques such as coalition structure
generation, Bayesian learning, and Belbin's role theory to facilitate the
generation of working groups in an educational context. This tool improves
current state of the art proposals in three ways: i) it takes into account the
feedback of other teammates in order to establish the most predominant role of
a student instead of self-perception questionnaires; ii) it handles uncertainty
with regard to each student's predominant team role; iii) it is iterative since
it considers information from several interactions in order to improve the
estimation of role assignments. We tested the performance of the proposed tool
in an experiment involving students that took part in three different team
activities. The experiments suggest that the proposed tool is able to improve
different teamwork aspects such as team dynamics and student satisfaction.

through terminal user interfaces, become a part of the system control loop
(e.g., medical and industrial systems). These terminals are typically embedded,
single-purpose devices with restricted functionality, sometimes air-gapped and
increasingly hardened.
  We describe a new way of attacking such terminals in which an adversary has
only temporary, non-invasive, physical access to the terminal. In this attack,
the adversary attaches a small device to the interface that connects user input
peripherals to the terminal. The device executes the attack when the authorized
user is performing safety-critical operations, by modifying or blocking user
input, or injecting new input events.
  Given that the attacker has access to user input, the execution of this
attack might seem trivial. However, to succeed, the attacker needs to overcome
a number of challenges including the inability to directly observe the user
interface and avoid being detected by the users. We present techniques that
allow user interface state and input tracking. We evaluate these techniques and
show that they can be implemented efficiently. We further evaluate the
effectiveness of our attack through an online user study and find input
modification attacks that are hard for the users to detect and would therefore
lead to serious violations of the input integrity.

noiseless and noisy reads are investigated in this paper. In the noiseless
case, necessary and sufficient conditions on perfect assembly are derived.
Moreover, asymptotically tight lower and upper bounds on the error probability

model. For the noisy case, we have proposed two novel DNA read denoising
methods, as well as corresponding upper bounds on assembly error probabilities.
It has been shown that, under mild circumstances, the performance of the

bijective (LSB) operations on $M$ integer data streams ($M\geq3$), such as:
scaling, additions/subtractions, inner or outer vector products, permutations
and convolutions. In the proposed method, the $M$ input integer data streams
are linearly superimposed to form $M$ numerically-entangled integer data
streams that are stored in-place of the original inputs. A series of LSB
operations can then be performed directly using these entangled data streams.
The results are extracted from the $M$ entangled output streams by additions
and arithmetic shifts. Any soft errors affecting any single disentangled output
stream are guaranteed to be detectable via a specific post-computation
reliability check. In addition, when utilizing a separate processor core for
each of the $M$ streams, the proposed approach can recover all outputs after
any single fail-stop failure. Importantly, unlike algorithm-based fault
tolerance (ABFT) methods, the number of operations required for the
entanglement, extraction and validation of the results is linearly related to
the number of the inputs and does not depend on the complexity of the performed
LSB operations. We have validated our proposal in an Intel processor (Haswell
architecture with AVX2 support) via fast Fourier transforms, circular
convolutions, and matrix multiplication operations. Our analysis and
experiments reveal that the proposed approach incurs between $0.03\%$ to $7\%$
reduction in processing throughput for a wide variety of LSB operations. This
overhead is 5 to 1000 times smaller than that of the equivalent ABFT method
that uses a checksum stream. Thus, our proposal can be used in fault-generating
processor hardware or safety-critical applications, where high reliability is
required without the cost of ABFT or modular redundancy.

place a temporal constraint amongst the nearby discrete measures $\{G_j\}$ in
the form of symmetric Kullback-Leibler (KL) Divergence with a fixed bound $B$.
Although the constraint we place only involves a single scalar value, it
nonetheless allows for flexibility in the corresponding successive measures.
Remarkably, it also led us to infer the model within the stick-breaking process
where the traditional Beta distribution used in stick-breaking is now replaced
by a new constraint calculated from $B$. We present the inference algorithm and
elaborate on its solutions. Our experiment using NIPS keywords has shown the
desirable effect of the model.

Furthermore, many exoplanets seem to be locked in a mean-motion resonance

eccentric planets can avoid close encounters. However, the present estimation

massive distributed antenna system (DAS) in the presence of pilot contamination
(PC), where the antennas are clustered on the remote radio heads (RRHs). We
employ a practical power consumption model by considering the transmit power,
the circuit power, and the backhaul power, in contrast to most of the existing
works which focus on co-located antenna systems (CAS) where the backhaul power
is negligible. For a given average user rate, we consider the problem of
maximizing the EE with respect to the number of each RRH antennas $n$, the
number of RRHs $M$, the number of users $K$, and study the impact of system
parameters on the optimal $n$, $M$ and $K$. Specifically, by applying random
matrix theory, we derive the closed-form expressions of the optimal $n$, and
find the solution of the optimal $M$ and $K$, under a simplified channel model
with maximum ratio transmission. From the results, we find that to achieve the
optimal EE, a large number of antennas is needed for a given user rate and PC.
As the number of users increases, EE can be improved further by having more
RRHs and antennas. Moreover, if the backhauling power is not large, massive DAS
can be more energy efficient than massive CAS. These insights provide a useful
guide to practical deployment of massive DAS.

mechanics of discrete meso-structures of materials such as 3D-printed
structures and foams. This contribution deals with the crack initiation and
propagation in such materials and focuses on an adaptive multiscale approach
that captures the spatially evolving fracture. Lattice networks naturally
incorporate non-locality, large deformations, and dissipative mechanisms taking
place inside fracture zones. Because the physically relevant length scales are
significantly larger than those of individual interactions, discrete models are
computationally expensive. The Quasicontinuum (QC) method is a multiscale
approach specifically constructed for discrete models. This method reduces the
computational cost by fully resolving the underlying lattice only in regions of
interest, while coarsening elsewhere. In this contribution, the (variational)
QC is applied to damageable lattices for engineering-scale predictions. To deal
with the spatially evolving fracture zone, an adaptive scheme is proposed.
Implications induced by the adaptive procedure are discussed from the
energy-consistency point of view, and theoretical considerations are
demonstrated on two examples. The first one serves as a proof of concept,
illustrates the consistency of the adaptive schemes, and presents errors in
energies. The second one demonstrates the performance of the adaptive QC scheme
for a more complex problem.

base station (BS) antennas is very high, since the number of feedback bits of
traditional codebooks scales linearly with the number of BS antennas. To reduce
the feedback overhead, an effective codebook based on channel statistics has
been designed, where the required number of feedback bits only scales linearly
with the rank of the channel correlation matrix. However, this attractive
conclusion was only intuitively explained and then verified through simulation
results in the literature, while no rigorous theoretical proof has been
provided. To fill in the gap between the theoretical conclusion and simulation
results, in this paper, we quantitatively analyze the performance of the
channel statistics-based codebook. Specifically, we firstly introduce the rate
gap between the ideal case of perfect channel state information at the
transmitter and the practical case of limited channel feedback, where we find
that the rate gap is dependent on the quantization error of the codebook. Then,
we derive an upper bound of the quantization error, based on which we prove
that the required feedback bits to ensure a constant rate gap only scales
linearly with the rank of the channel correlation matrix. Finally, numerical
results are provided to verify this conclusion. To the best of our knowledge,
our work is the first one to provide a rigorous proof of this conclusion.

explore different solutions and scenarios, previous works have framed this
problem into a Public Goods Game (PGG), where a dilemma between short-term
interests and long-term sustainability arises$^{5-9}$. In such a context,
subjects are placed in groups and play a PGG with the aim of avoiding dangerous
climate change impact. Here we report on a lab experiment designed to explore
two important ingredients: costly punishment to free-riders and group size. Our
results show that for high punishment risk, more groups succeed in achieving
the global target, this finding being robust against group size. Interestingly
enough, we also find a non-trivial effect of the size of the groups: the larger
the size of the groups facing the dilemmas, the higher the punishment risk
should be to achieve the desired goal. Overall, the results of the present
study shed more light into possible deterrent effects of plausible measures

4-47 and NGC 7662, obtained using NIRI@Gemini-North, are presented here. K 4-47
reveals a remarkable high-collimated bipolar structure. The H$_2$ emission
emanates from the walls of the bipolar outflows and a pair of knots at the tips
of these outflows. The H$_2$ 1-0 S(1)/2-1 S(1) line ratio is $\sim$7-10 which
indicates shock interaction due to both the lateral expansion of the gas in the
outflows and the high-velocity knots. The strongest line, H$_2$ v=1-0 S(1), is
also detected in several LISs located at the periphery of the outer shell of
the elliptical PN NGC 7662, whereas only four knots are detected in the H$_2$
v=2-1 S(1) line. These knots have H$_2$ v=1-0 S(1)/v=2-1 S(1) values between 2

and slowly moving LISs (NGC 7662). The H$_2$ emission in K 4-47 is powered by
shocks, whereas in NGC 7662 is due to photo-ionization by the central star.
Moreover, a likely correlation is found between the H$_2$ v=1-0 S(1)/H$_2$
v=2-1 S(1) and [N II]/H$\alpha$ line ratios.

studies the optimization of dictionaries on image data where the representation
is enforced to be explicitly sparse with respect to a smooth, normalized
sparseness measure. This involves the computation of Euclidean projections onto
level sets of the sparseness measure. While previous algorithms for this
optimization problem had at least quasi-linear time complexity, here the first
algorithm with linear time complexity and constant space complexity is
proposed. The key for this is the mathematically rigorous derivation of a
characterization of the projection's result based on a soft-shrinkage function.
This theory is applied in an original algorithm called Easy Dictionary Learning
(EZDL), which learns dictionaries with a simple and fast-to-compute
Hebbian-like learning rule. The new algorithm is efficient, expressive and
particularly simple to implement. It is demonstrated that despite its
simplicity, the proposed learning algorithm is able to generate a rich variety
of dictionaries, in particular a topographic organization of atoms or separable
atoms. Further, the dictionaries are as expressive as those of benchmark
learning algorithms in terms of the reproduction quality on entire images, and
result in an equivalent denoising performance. EZDL learns approximately 30 %
faster than the already very efficient Online Dictionary Learning algorithm,
and is therefore eligible for rapid data set analysis and problems with vast
quantities of learning samples.

density of dark energy is given as a combination of the Hubble parameter and
its derivative. The equations of motion are integrated and the resulting model
is analysed under many aspects, including the state finder parameters and the
generalised thermodynamics second law. Under the consideration that the
universe is dominated by EHRDE the evolution equation for the bulk viscous
pressure $\Pi$ in the framework of the truncated Israel-Stewart theory has been
taken as $\tau \dot{\Pi}+\Pi=-3\xi H$, where $\tau$ is the relaxation time and
$\xi$ is the bulk viscosity coefficient. Considering effective pressure as a
sum of thermodynamic pressure of EHRDE and bulk viscous pressure it has been
observed that under the influence of bulk viscosity the EoS parameter $w_{DE}$
is behaving like phantom i.e. $w_{DE}\leq -1$. It has been observed that the
magnitude of the effective pressure $p_{eff}=p+\Pi$ is decaying with time. We
also investigated the case for a specific choice of scale factor namely
$a(t)=(t-t_0)^{\frac{\beta}{1-\alpha}}$. For this choice we have observed that
a transition from quintessence to phantom is possible for the equation of state
parameter. However, the $\Lambda$CDM phase is not attainable by the statefinder
trajectories for this choice. Finally it has been observed that in both of the
cases the generalized second law of thermodynamics is valid for the viscous
EHRDE dominated universe enveloped by the apparent horizon.

investigates these challenges by developing an AC TS-based real-time
