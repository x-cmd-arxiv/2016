specific flavour structures. Leptonic flavour mixing originates from the
misalignment of flavon vacuum expectation values which respect different
residual symmetries in the charged lepton and neutrino sectors. Flavon cross
couplings are usually forbidden, in order to protect these symmetries. Contrary
to this approach, we show that cross couplings can play a key role and give
raise to necessary corrections to flavour-mixing patterns, including a non-zero
value for the reactor angle and CP violation. For definiteness, we present two
models based on $A_4$. In the first model, all flavons are assumed to be real
or pseudo-real, with 7 real degrees of freedom in the flavon sector in total. A
sizable reactor angle associated with nearly maximal CP violation is achieved,
and, as both originate from the same cross coupling, a sum rule results with a
precise prediction for the value of the Dirac CP-violating phase. In the second
model, the flavons are taken to be complex scalars, which can be connected with
supersymmetric models and multi-Higgs models. The complexity properties of
flavons provide new sources for generating the reactor angle. Models in this
new approach introduce very few degrees of freedom beyond the Standard Model
and can be more economical than those in the framework of extra dimension or
supersymmetry.

wireless communication networks. We provide a new algorithm, named Dual Link
algorithm, for the classic problem of weighted sum-rate maximization for MIMO
multiaccess channels (MAC), broadcast channels (BC), and general MIMO
interference channels with Gaussian input and a total power constraint. For
MIMO MAC/BC, the algorithm finds optimal signals to achieve the capacity region
boundary. For interference channels with Gaussian input assumption, two of the
previous state-of-the-art algorithms are the WMMSE algorithm and the polite
water-filling (PWF) algorithm. The WMMSE algorithm is provably convergent,
while the PWF algorithm takes the advantage of the optimal transmit signal
structure and converges the fastest in most situations but is not guaranteed to
converge in all situations. It is highly desirable to design an algorithm that
has the advantages of both algorithms. The dual link algorithm is such an
algorithm. Its fast and guaranteed convergence is important to distributed
implementation and time varying channels. In addition, the technique and a
scaling invariance property used in the convergence proof may find applications
in other non-convex problems in communication networks.

free-text review content. In this paper, we conducted a comprehensive feature

account effects of spin-orbit interaction. We find that bound excitons ($A$ and
$B$ peaks) and resonant excitons ($C$ peak) exhibit different behavior with
temperature, displaying different non-radiative linewidths. We conclude that
the inhomogeneous broadening of the absorption spectra is mainly due to
electron-phonon scattering mechanisms. Our calculations explain the
shortcomings of previous (zero-temperature) theoretical spectra and match well
with the experimental spectra acquired at room temperature. Moreover, we
disentangle the contributions of acoustic and optical phonon modes to the
quasi-particles and exciton linewidths. Our model also allows to identify which
phonon modes couple to each exciton state, useful for the interpretation of

M_p/(dot M), where M_p is the mass of the less massive component (the

place mostly onto the more massive component, with the accretion rate onto the

flocks of birds and schools of fish at the macro-scale. Such clusters typically
encounter very heterogeneous environments. What happens when a cluster
encounters an interface between two different environments has implications for
its function and fate. Here we study this problem by using a mathematical model
of a cluster that treats it as a single cohesive unit that moves in two
dimensions by exerting a force/torque per unit area whose magnitude depends on
the nature of the local environment. We find that low speed (overdamped)
clusters encountering an interface with a moderate difference in properties can
lead to refraction or even total internal reflection of the cluster. For large
speeds (underdamped), where inertia dominates, the clusters show more complex
behaviors crossing the interface multiple times and deviating from the
predictable refraction and reflection for the low velocity clusters. We then
present an extreme limit of the model in the absense of rotational damping
where clusters can become stuck spiraling along the interface or move in large
circular trajectories after leaving the interface. Our results show a wide
range of behaviors that occur when collectively moving active biological matter
moves across interfaces and these insights can be used to control motion by
patterning environments.

to be made. A distinguishing characteristic between the two scenarios is that
dark matter particles can produce a gravitational effect, in principle, without
the need of baryons while this is not the case for the modified gravity
scenario where such an effect must be correlated with the amount of baryonic
matter. We consider here ultra-faint dwarf (UFD) galaxies as a promising arena
to test the two scenarios based on the above assertion. We compare the
correlation of the luminosity with the velocity dispersion between samples of
UFD and non-UFD galaxies, finding a significant loss of correlation for UFD
galaxies. For example, we find for 28 non-UFD galaxies a strong correlation
coefficient of -0.688 which drops to -0.077 for the 23 UFD galaxies. Incoming

galaxies is physical or due to systematics in the data. Such a loss of

the aim of estimating the final global distribution on the ocean floor. We
study the influences of magnetic fields, angle of arrival, wind and ocean
cycling of SN material on the concentrations at different locations. We find
that the passage of SN material through the mesosphere/lower thermosphere (MLT)
is the greatest influence on the final global distribution, with ocean cycling
causing lesser alteration as the SN material sinks to the ocean floor. SN
distance estimates in previous works that assumed a uniform distribution are a
good approximation. Including the effects on surface distributions, we estimate
a distance of $46^{+10}_{-6}$ pc for a $8-10 \ M_{\odot}$ SN progenitor. This
is consistent with a SN occurring within the Tuc-Hor stellar group $\sim$2.8
Myr ago with SN material arriving on Earth $\sim$2.2 Myr ago. We note that the
SN dust retains directional information to within $1^{\circ}$ through its
arrival in the inner Solar System, so that SN debris deposition on inert bodies
such as the Moon will be anisotropic, and thus could in principle be used to
infer directional information. In particular, we predict that existing lunar
samples should show measurable $^{60}$Fe differences.

(FUV). For several locations in the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC), Far
Ultraviolet Spectroscopic Explorer (FUSE) satellite has observed diffuse
radiation in the FUV with intensities ranging from 1000 - 3 X 10^5 photon units
and diffuse fraction between 5% - 20% at 1100 {\deg}A. Here, we compare the FUV
diffuse emission with the mid-infrared (MIR) and far-infrared (FIR) diffuse
emission observed by the Spitzer Space Telescope and the AKARI satellite for
the same locations. The intensity ratios in the different MIR and FIR bands for
each of the locations will enable us to determine the type of dust contributing
to the diffuse emission as well as to derive a more accurate 3D distribution of
stars and dust in the region, which in turn may be used to model the observed
scattering in the FUV. In this work we present the infrared (IR) data for two
different regions in LMC, namely N11 and 30 Doradus. We also present the FUV~IR
correlation for different infrared bands.

exponent, have been successfully deployed in practice, adopted in industrial
standards, and have spawned a rich body of research in academia, focused
primarily on static analysis. The present work represents a significant advance
on the problem of artifact verification, by considering a much richer and more
realistic model than in previous work, incorporating core elements of IBM's
successful Guard-Stage-Milestone model. In particular, the model features task
hierarchy, concurrency, and richer artifact data. It also allows database key
and foreign key dependencies, as well as arithmetic constraints. The results
show decidability of verification and establish its complexity, making use of
novel techniques including a hierarchy of Vector Addition Systems and a variant
of quantifier elimination tailored to our context.

systems by modelling the relations between their constituent objects. In recent
years great progress has been made by augmenting `traditional' network theory.
However, existing network representations still lack crucial features in order
to serve as a general data analysis tool. These include, most importantly, an
explicit association of information with possibly heterogeneous types of
objects and relations, and a conclusive representation of the properties of
groups of nodes as well as the interactions between such groups on different
scales. In this paper, we introduce a collection of definitions resulting in a
framework that, on the one hand, entails and unifies existing network
representations (e.g., network of networks, multilayer networks), and on the
other hand, generalizes and extends them by incorporating the above features.
To implement these features, we first specify the nodes and edges of a finite
graph as sets of properties. Second, the mathematical concept of partition
lattices is transferred to network theory in order to demonstrate how
partitioning the node and edge set of a graph into supernodes and superedges
allows to aggregate, compute and allocate information on and between arbitrary
groups of nodes. The derived partition lattice of a graph, which we denote by
deep graph, constitutes a concise, yet comprehensive representation that
enables the expression and analysis of heterogeneous properties, relations and
interactions on all scales of a complex system in a self-contained manner.
Furthermore, to be able to utilize existing network-based methods and models,
we derive different representations of multilayer networks from our framework
and demonstrate the advantages of our representation. We exemplify an
application of deep graphs using a real world dataset of precipitation
measurements.

pump- 0.154 nm probe delay time. Curve width broadening, peak diffracted
intensity and angular shift were recorded for the range of UV excitation
intensities of 2-8 mJ/cm2 . Observed oscillations in time delay dependences of
shift, width and of peak intensity of rocking curves are correlated, as
described by acoustic pulse bouncing between crystal surfaces. In (111) Au,
acoustic pulse originates from pump absorption layer, and peak intensity drops
by a factor of two (at delay time at which sonic wave reaches Au-substrate
boundary) of its initial value prior to absorption of laser pulse. In Cu,
correlated rocking curves dynamics is also observed, however buildup of rocking
curve broadening is faster than one can expect from sonic wavepacket
originating in pump absorption layer. This effect is attributed to acoustic
phonon generation outside of pump absorption layer, it is much stronger in Cu
than in Au. Phonon generation in Cu is distributed throughout the whole bulk of
crystal due to delocalization of mobile hot electrons diffusing from pump
absorption layer.

using hand-crafted features that have no resemblance to the signature
generation process. To this end, we use Deep Convolutional Neural Networks to
learn features in a writer-independent format, and use this model to obtain a
feature representation on another set of users, where we train writer-dependent
classifiers. We tested our method in two datasets: GPDS-960 and Brazilian
PUC-PR. Our experimental results show that the features learned in a subset of
the users are discriminative for the other users, including across different

stations is a source of information on shower development. The azimuthal
asymmetry is due to a combination of the longitudinal evolution of the shower
and geometrical effects related to the angles of incidence of the particles
into the detectors. The magnitude of the effect depends upon the zenith angle
and state of development of the shower and thus provides a novel observable,
$(\sec \theta)_\mathrm{max}$, sensitive to the mass composition of cosmic rays
above $3 \times 10^{18}$ eV. By comparing measurements with predictions from
shower simulations, we find for both of our adopted models of hadronic physics
(QGSJETII-04 and EPOS-LHC) an indication that the mean cosmic-ray mass
increases slowly with energy, as has been inferred from other studies. However,
the mass estimates are dependent on the shower model and on the range of
distance from the shower core selected. Thus the method has uncovered further
deficiencies in our understanding of shower modelling that must be resolved
before the mass composition can be inferred from $(\sec \theta)_\mathrm{max}$.

another one at lower temperature that may be due to the transition from the HO

robustness to illumination changes, which has made them popular for
feature-based VSLAM\@. However, in degraded imaging conditions such as low
light, low texture, blur and specular reflections, feature extraction is often
unreliable. In contrast, direct VSLAM methods which estimate the camera pose by
minimizing the photometric error using raw pixel intensities are often more
robust to low textured environments and blur. Nonetheless, at the core of
direct VSLAM is the reliance on a consistent photometric appearance across
images, otherwise known as the brightness constancy assumption. Unfortunately,
brightness constancy seldom holds in real world applications.
  In this work, we overcome brightness constancy by incorporating feature
descriptors into a direct visual odometry framework. This combination results
in an efficient algorithm that combines the strength of both feature-based
algorithms and direct methods. Namely, we achieve robustness to arbitrary
photometric variations while operating in low-textured and poorly lit
environments. Our approach utilizes an efficient binary descriptor, which we
call Bit-Planes, and show how it can be used in the gradient-based optimization
required by direct methods. Moreover, we show that the squared Euclidean
distance between Bit-Planes is equivalent to the Hamming distance. Hence, the
descriptor may be used in least squares optimization without sacrificing its
photometric invariance. Finally, we present empirical results that demonstrate
the robustness of the approach in poorly lit underground environments.

of military, law enforcement, and wildlife management agencies are giving
careful consideration to lead-free ammunition. The goal of lead-free bullets is
to gain the advantages of reduced lead use in the environment while maintaining
equal or better terminal performance. Accepting reduced terminal performance
would foolishly risk the lives of military and law enforcement personnel. This
paper uses the established technique of studying bullet impacts in ballistic
gelatin to characterize the terminal performance of eight commercial off-the-
shelf lead-free handgun bullets for comparison with earlier analysis of
jacketed lead bullets. Peak retarding force and energy deposit in calibrated
ballistic gelatin are quantified using high speed video. The temporary stretch
cavities and permanent wound cavities are also characterized. Two factors tend
to reduce the terminal performance of these lead-free projectiles compared to
similar jacketed lead designs. First, solid copper construction increase barrel
friction, which reduces muzzle velocity and energy, and thus reduces the
ability of the bullet to exert damaging forces in tissue simulant. Second, the
lower density of copper requires a longer bullet for a given mass and caliber,
which reduces remaining powder volume in the brass cartridge case, which also
tends to reduce muzzle velocity and energy. The results of the present study
are consistent with earlier analysis showing that expansion is necessary to
maximize the potential for rapid incapacitation of enemy combatants. In spite
of some new non-expanding nose designs that moderately increase forces between
bullet and tissue, the largest retarding forces and highest incapacitation
potential requires expanding bullets which maximize frontal area.

evaluate functional traces containing these ""mixed"" one-loop terms, we develop
a new covariant derivative expansion (CDE) technique that is capable of
evaluating a much wider class of traces than previous methods. The technique is
detailed in an appendix, so that it can be read independently from the rest of

one-loop terms coming from diagrams involving only heavy propagators from

period of the binary. As a result, SMBHBs may be recognized by the periodic
modulation of their brightness. We conducted a statistical search for periodic
variability in a sample of 35,383 spectroscopically confirmed quasars in the

identified 50 quasars with significant periodicity beyond the DRW model,

remain significant after a re-analysis of their periodograms including
additional optical data from the intermediate-PTF and the Catalina Real-Time

correlates with optical light-curve shape, while there are no obvious and

create a UV spectral model for SNe Ia at peak brightness. With the model, we
can examine how individual SNe vary relative to expectations based on only
their light-curve shape. Doing this, we confirm an excess of flux for SN 2011fe

Hypothetically, they can form either as single stars or as mass donors in close

question as to the impact of binarity on the WR population. By performing a
spectral analysis of all multiple WR systems in the SMC, we obtain the full set
of stellar parameters for each individual component. Mass-luminosity relations
are tested, and the importance of the binary evolution channel is assessed. The
spectral analysis is performed with the PoWR model atmosphere code by
superimposing model spectra that correspond to each component. Evolutionary
channels are constrained using the BPASS evolution tool. Significant Hydrogen
mass fractions (0.1 - 0.4) are detected in all WN components. A comparison with
mass-luminosity relations and evolutionary tracks implies that the majority of
the WR stars in our sample are not chemically homogeneous. The WR component in
the binary AB 6 is found to be very luminous (Log L ~ 6.3 [Lsun]) given its
orbital mass (~10 Msun), presumably because of observational contamination by a
third component. Evolutionary paths derived for our objects suggest that Roche
lobe overflow had occurred in most systems, affecting their evolution. However,
the implied initial masses are large enough for the primaries to have entered
the WR phase, regardless of binary interaction. Together with the results for
the putatively single SMC WR stars, our study suggests that the binary
evolution channel does not dominate the formation of WR stars at SMC
metallicity.

at lower energies, and falls off quickly above an energy ~5 GeV. The spectrum
of the excess above ~10 GeV is potentially an important discriminator between
different physical models for its origin. We focus our study on observations of
the gamma-ray excess at energies exceeding 10 GeV, finding: (1) a statistically
significant excess remains in the energy range 9.5-47.5 GeV, which is not
degenerate with known diffuse emission templates such as the Fermi Bubbles, (2)
the radial profile of the excess at high energies remains relatively consistent

greater ellipticity with a major axis oriented perpendicular to the Galactic
plane. Using the recently developed non-Poissonian template fit, we find mild
evidence for a point-source origin for the high-energy excess, although given
the statistical and systematic uncertainties we show that a smooth origin of
the high-energy emission cannot be ruled out. We discuss the implication of
these findings for pulsar and dark matter models of the gamma-ray excess.

arms the peculiar galacto-centric radial and azimuthal velocity field is
directed radially outward and azimuthally backward, whereas it is radially
inward and azimuthally forward on the leading edge. Owing to the negative
radial metallicity gradient, this systematic motion drives, at a given radius,
an azimuthal variation in the residual metallicity that is characterised by a
metal rich trailing edge and a metal poor leading edge. We show that these

Galactic latitude, using the Stokes parameter Planck maps at 353 GHz. Our aim
is to advance the understanding of the magnetized interstellar medium (ISM),
and to provide a model of the polarized dust foreground for cosmic microwave
background component-separation procedures. Focusing on the southern Galactic
cap, we examine the statistical distributions of the polarization fraction
($p$) and angle ($\psi$) to characterize the ordered and turbulent components
of the Galactic magnetic field (GMF) in the solar neighbourhood. We relate
patterns at large angular scales in polarization to the orientation of the mean
(ordered) GMF towards Galactic coordinates $(l_0,b_0)=(70^\circ \pm
5^\circ,24^\circ \pm 5^\circ)$. The histogram of $p$ shows a wide dispersion up
to 25 %. The histogram of $\psi$ has a standard deviation of $12^\circ$ about
the regular pattern expected from the ordered GMF. We use these histograms to
build a phenomenological model of the turbulent component of the GMF, assuming
a uniform effective polarization fraction ($p_0$) of dust emission. To model

localized at a triple point singularity of arithmetic genus g=3 in the curve

can be further unHiggsed to realize non-Abelian G_2xSU(2) models with more
conventional matter content or SU(2)^3 models with trifundamental matter. The
U(1) models used as the basis for this construction do not seem to have a

extended wings between 300 km/s to 1200 km/s. The Lyman alpha surface flux
positively correlates with the MgII surface flux and negatively correlates with
the stellar rotation period. Stars with larger Lyman alpha surface flux also
tend to have larger surface flux in ions formed at higher temperatures, but
these correlations remain statistically insignificant in our sample of 11

However, especially at low redshifts (z < 1.5) LGRBs seem to prefer particular
types of environment. Our aim is to study the host galaxies of a complete
sample of bright LGRBs to investigate the impact of the environment on GRB
formation. We study host galaxy spectra of the Swift/BAT6 complete sample of 14
z < 1 bright LGRBs. We use the detected nebular emission lines to measure the
dust extinction, star formation rate (SFR) and nebular metallicity (Z) of the
hosts and supplement the data set with previously measured stellar masses
M$_{\star}$. The distributions of the obtained properties and their
interrelations (e.g. mass-metallicity and SFR-M$_{\star}$ relations) are
compared to samples of field star-forming galaxies.We find that LGRB hosts at z
< 1 have on average lower SFRs than if they were direct star-formation tracers.
By directly comparing metallicity distributions of LGRB hosts and star-forming
galaxies, we find a good match between the two populations up to Z $\sim
8.4-8.5$, after which the paucity of metal-rich LGRB hosts becomes apparent.
The LGRB host galaxies of our complete sample are not inconsistent with the
mass-metallicity relation at similar mean redshift and stellar masses. The
cutoff against high metallicities (and high masses) can explain the low SFR
values of LGRB hosts. We find a hint of increased incidence of starburst
galaxies in the Swift/BAT6 z < 1 sample with respect to that of a field
star-forming population. Given that the SFRs are low on average, the latter is
ascribed to low stellar masses. Nevertheless the limits on the completeness and
metallicity availability of current surveys, coupled with the limited number of
LGRB host galaxies, prevent us from reaching more quantitative conclusions.

strongly suppressed at low dust extinction, A_v, and possibly saturates towards
high A_v, in agreement with observations. The I_CO - A_v relation shifts
towards higher A_v for higher metallicities and, to a lesser extent, for

medium (ICM) appears remarkably isothermal. The core is dynamically disturbed
with multiple sloshing induced cold fronts, with indications for both
Rayleigh-Taylor and Kelvin-Helmholtz instabilities. The sloshing is the result
of the strongly perturbed gravitational potential in the cluster core, with the
central brightest cluster galaxy (BCG) being displaced southward from the
global center of mass. The residual image reveals a likely subcluster south of
the core at the projected distance of r~280 kpc. The cluster also harbors a
likely radio phoenix, a source revived by adiabatic compression by gas motions
in the ICM. Even though the Ophiuchus cluster is strongly dynamically active,
the amplitude of density fluctuations outside of the cooling core is low,
indicating velocities smaller than ~100 km/s. The density fluctuations might be
damped by thermal conduction in the hot and remarkably isothermal ICM,
resulting in our underestimate of gas velocities. We find a surprising, sharp
surface brightness discontinuity, that is curved away from the core, at r~120
kpc to the southeast of the cluster center. We conclude that this feature is
most likely due to gas dynamics associated with a merger and not a result of an
extraordinary active galactic nucleus (AGN) outburst. The cooling core lacks
any observable X-ray cavities and the AGN only displays weak, point-like radio
emission, lacking lobes or jets, indicating that currently it may be largely
dormant. The lack of strong AGN activity may be due to the bulk of the cooling
taking place offset from the central supermassive black hole.

the cosmic microwave background and direct detection, but significant regions

show that as a consequence of the initial differences in the structural
properties of the first-generation (FG) and the second-generation (SG)

binary fraction decreases more rapidly than that of the FG population. The
difference between the FG and SG binary fraction is qualitatively similar to
but quantitatively smaller than that found for wider binaries in our previous
investigations.The evolution of the radial variation of the binary fraction is
driven by the interplay between binary segregation, ionization and ejection.
Ionization and ejection counteract in part the effects of mass segregation but
for compact binaries the effects of segregation dominate and the inner binary
fraction increases during the cluster evolution. We explore the variation of
the difference between the FG and the SG binary fraction with the distance from
the cluster centre and its dependence on the binary binding energy and cluster
structural parameters. The difference between the binary fraction in the FG and
the SG populations found in our simulations is consistent with the results of
observational studies finding a smaller binary fraction in the SG population.

is in good agreement with the age range expected when the effects of rotation
in MSTO stars are wrongly interpreted in terms of age spread. We also do not
find evidence for multiple, isolated episodes of star-formation bursts within
the cluster, in contradiction to scenarios that invoke actual age spreads to
explain the eMSTO phenomenon. NGC 1850 therefore continues the trend of eMSTO
clusters where the inferred age spread is proportional to the age of the
cluster. While our results confirm a key prediction of the scenario where
stellar rotation causes the eMSTO feature, direct measurements of the
rotational rate of MSTO stars is required to definitively confirm or refute
whether stellar rotation is the origin of the eMSTO phenomenon or if it is due

We parametrize the distance-redshift relation, relative to a fiducial model, as
a quadratic expansion. We measure its coefficients and reconstruct the
distance-redshift relation from the expansion. We apply the redshift weighting
technique in Zhu et al. (2015) to the clustering of galaxies from 1000 QuickPM
(QPM) mock simulations after reconstruction and achieve a 0.75% measurement of
the angular diameter distance $D_A$ at $z=0.64$ and the same precision for
Hubble parameter H at $z=0.29$. These QPM mock catalogs are designed to mimic
the clustering and noise level of the Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey
(BOSS) Data Release 12 (DR12). We compress the correlation functions in the
redshift direction onto a set of weighted correlation functions. These
estimators give unbiased $D_A$ and $H$ measurements at all redshifts within the
range of the combined sample. We demonstrate the effectiveness of redshift
weighting in improving the distance and Hubble parameter estimates. Instead of
measuring at a single 'effective' redshift as in traditional analyses, we
report our $D_A$ and $H$ measurements at all redshifts. The measured fractional
error of $D_A$ ranges from 1.53% at $z=0.2$ to 0.75% at $z=0.64$. The
fractional error of $H$ ranges from 0.75% at $z=0.29$ to 2.45% at $z = 0.7$.
Our measurements are consistent with a Fisher forecast to within 10% to 20%
depending on the pivot redshift. We further show the results are robust against
the choice of fiducial cosmologies, galaxy bias models, and RSD streaming

any explicit definition of spiral arm locations. We show that the molecular gas
mass fraction, i.e., fmol=H2/ (HI+H2) in mass, varies predominantly in the
radial direction: starting from ~100% at the center, remaining ~>50% (~>60%) to
R~6kpc, and decreasing to ~10-20% (~50%) at R=8.5 kpc when averaged over the
whole disk thickness (in the mid plane). Azimuthal, arm-interarm variations are
secondary: only ~20%, in the globally molecule-dominated inner MW, but becoming
larger, ~40-50%, in the atom-dominated outskirts. This suggests that in the
inner MW, the gas stays highly molecular (fmol>50%) as it goes from an interarm
region, into a spiral arm, and back into the next interarm region. Stellar
feedback does not dissociate molecules much, and the coagulation and
fragmentation of molecular clouds dominate the evolution of the ISM at these
radii. The trend differs in the outskirts, where the gas phase is globally
atomic (fmol<50%). The HI and H2 phases cycle through spiral arm passage there.
These different regimes of ISM evolution are also seen in external galaxies
(e.g., LMC, M33, and M51). We explain the radial gradient of fmol by a simple
flow continuity model. The effects of spiral arms on this analysis are
illustrated in Appendix.

strategies. The methodology is applied to general Time-Varying Multiple Input
Multiple Output (MIMO) Gaussian Linear Channel Models (G-LCMs) with memory,
subject to average transmission cost constraints of quadratic form. The
realizations of optimal distributions by randomized strategies are shown to
exhibit a decomposion into a deterministic part and a random part. The
decomposition reveals the dual role of randomized strategies, to control the
channel output process and to transmit new information over the channels.
Moreover, a separation principle is shown between the computation of the
optimal deterministic part and the random part of the randomized strategies.
The dual role of randomized strategies generalizes the
Linear-Quadratic-Gaussian (LQG) stochastic optimal control theory to directed
information pay-offs. The characterizations of feedback capacity are obtained
from the per unit time limits of finite-time horizon directed information,
without imposing \'a priori assumptions, such as, stability of channel models
or ergodicity of channel input and output processes. For time-invariant MIMO
G-LCMs with memory, it is shown that whether feedback increases capacity, is
directly related to the channel parameters and the transmission cost function,
through the solutions of Riccati matrix equations, and moreover for unstable
channels, feedback capacity is non-zero, provided the power exceeds a critical

Optical (RF/FSO) PHY layers, the high data rate FSO links can be used to
increase the contact bandwidth. However, due to the highly directional nature
of FSO links, broadcasting is difficult. A naive broadcast strategy where the
beam divergence angle is increased to include many nodes in the broadcast set
results in low data rate, and does not always result in the minimum achievable
delay.
  In this work we develop an optimal multicast algorithm for hybrid RF/FSO
networks. We show that the problem is an abstraction of the minimum weight set
cover problem which is known to be NP-hard. A computationally cheap greedy
local optimum heuristic is proposed. A comprehensive evaluation using delay,
throughput and computation time as metrics is performed using various
solutions. These extensive evaluations show that our solution outperforms both
naive broadcast and multiple unicast, taking 95% less time as compared to the
exact algorithm, while providing comparable performance.

maximum bending amplitude upstream of the trailing edge. For 2D simulations,
imposing a deformation based on measured displacement for carangiform swimming

find that the upstream fish benefits energetically only for small distances. In

nucleus from the characteristics of the ejecta cloud produced by the impactor
of the Deep Impact mission. For this purpose we use two techniques. We first
study the shadow cast on the nucleus surface by the ejecta cloud and
investigate how areas of different brightness are related to the varying
optical thickness or albedo of the ejecta cloud. The shadow was seen during the
first 2.0 seconds after the impact (afterward it became obscured by the ejecta
cloud). We have found that all brightness variations in the shadow are the
result of the surface inhomogeneities, indicating that during first 2.0 seconds
the ejecta cloud was homogeneous within the MRI spatial resolution. Our second
technique is to study the obscuration of the nucleus limb by the ejecta. This
study covers the period 0.76- 68.8 seconds after impact and is based on
comparison of the ejecta cloud brightness on the limb and just beyond the limb.
At this stage we do see inhomogeneities in the ejecta cloud that relate to the
albedo and optical thickness variations in the ejected dust. Specifically, we
have found two distinct bands of low optical thickness and one band of a high
optical thickness. Based on crater formation ideas we estimate the depth of
excavation of the ejected material for the found inhomogeneities and, thus,
define a potential layering structure for the comet nucleus, Our estimates
suggest that the low-optical thickness material was excavated from a depth of
15-18 and 30-32 meters in the case the porous nucleus material and 37-46 and
87-93 meters in the case of a non-porous nucleus material, and a layer of high
optical thickness originated from the depth 9-11 m for porous material or 20-23
m for non-porous material. Based on the crater diameter estimates, we expect
that the real depth of the layers is between these two cases.

interact with an asymmetric substrate, a net dc directed motion can arise even

active matter ratchets for swimming bacteria, cells, active colloids, and

describe ratchet reversals produced by collective effects and the use of active

(SrI$_2$:Eu) has resulted in state-of-the-art $\gamma$-ray detectors with
remarkably high energy resolution, far exceeding that of most halide compounds.
In this class of materials the formation of self-trapped hole polarons is very
common. However, polaron formation is usually expected to limit carrier
mobilities and has been associated with poor scintillator light-yield
proportionality and resolution. Here, using a recently developed
first-principles method, we perform an unprecedented study of polaron transport
in SrI$_2$, both for equilibrium polarons, as well as nascent polarons
immediately following a self-trapping event. As a result, we put forward a
rationale for the unexpected high energy resolution of SrI$_2$. We identify
nine stable hole polaron configurations, which consist of dimerized iodine
pairs with polaron binding energies of up to 0.5\,eV. They are connected by a
complex potential energy landscape that comprises 66 unique nearest-neighbor
migration paths. \textit{Ab initio} molecular dynamics simulations reveal that
a large fraction of polarons is born into configurations that migrate
practically barrier free at room temperature. As a result, carriers created
during $\gamma$-irradiation can quickly diffuse away reducing the chance for
non-linear recombination reactions that are the primary culprits for
non-proportionality and resolution reduction. This leads to the conclusion that
the flat, albeit complex, landscape for polaron migration in SrI$_2$ is key for
understanding its outstanding performance. This insight provides important
guidance not only for the future development of high-performance scintillators
but also of other materials, for which large polaron mobilities are crucial
such as batteries and solid state ionic conductors.

stepping, can be used within tent-shaped spacetime domains. The technique
transforms the equations within a spacetime tent to a domain where space and
time are separable. After detailing techniques based on this mapping, several
examples including the acoustic wave equation and the Euler system are
considered.

in dual-phase xenon-based dark matter experiments. A recombination model is
developed to explain the recombination probability as a function of recoil
energy at zero field and non-zero field. The role of e-ion recombination is
discussed for both parent recombination and volume recombination. We find that
the volume recombination under non-zero field is constrained by a plasma
effect, which is caused by a high density of charge carriers along the
ionization track forming a plasma-like cloud of charge that shields the
interior from the influence of the external electric field. Subsequently, the
plasma time that determines the volume recombination probability at non-zero
field is demonstrated to be different between electronic recoils and nuclear
recoils due to the difference of ionization density between two processes. We
show a weak field-dependence of the plasma time for nuclear recoils and a
stronger field-dependence of the plasma time for electronic recoils. As a
result, the time-dependent recombination is implemented in the determination of
charge and light yield with a generic model. Our model agrees well with the
available experimental data from xenon-based dark matter experiments.

interpreted as the logic of (closed) subspaces of a Hilbert space. There is a
progression from the usual Boolean logic of subsets to the ""quantum logic"" of
subspaces of a general vector space--which is then specialized to the closed
subspaces of a Hilbert space. But there is a ""dual"" progression. The notion of
a partition (or quotient set or equivalence relation) is dual (in a
category-theoretic sense) to the notion of a subset. Hence the Boolean logic of
subsets has a dual logic of partitions. Then the dual progression is from that
logic of partitions to the quantum logic of direct-sum decompositions (i.e.,
the vector space version of a set partition) of a general vector space--which
can then be specialized to the direct-sum decompositions of a Hilbert space.
This allows the logic to express measurement by any self-adjoint operators
rather than just the projection operators associated with subspaces. In this
introductory paper, the focus is on the quantum logic of direct-sum
decompositions of a finite-dimensional vector space (including such a Hilbert
space). The primary special case examined is finite vector spaces over 2 where
the pedagogical model of quantum mechanics over sets (QM/Sets) is formulated.
In the Appendix, the combinatorics of direct-sum decompositions of finite
vector spaces over GF(q) is analyzed with computations for the case of QM/Sets
where q=2.

systematically address these issues with a novel, real-time, end-to-end
reconstruction framework. At its core is a robust pose estimation strategy,
optimizing per frame for a global set of camera poses by considering the
complete history of RGB-D input with an efficient hierarchical approach. We
remove the heavy reliance on temporal tracking, and continually localize to the
globally optimized frames instead. We contribute a parallelizable optimization
framework, which employs correspondences based on sparse features and dense
geometric and photometric matching. Our approach estimates globally optimized

recovery from gross tracking failures (i.e., relocalization), and re-estimates
the 3D model in real-time to ensure global consistency; all within a single
framework. Our approach outperforms state-of-the-art online systems with
quality on par to offline methods, but with unprecedented speed and scan

existence of several very massive stars in the periphery of NGC 3603. The first
group of objects (MTT58, WR42e and RFS7) is compound by three new Galactic
exemplars of the OIf*/WN type, all of them with probable initial masses well
above 100 Msun and estimated ages of about 1 Myr. Based on Goodman blue-optical
spectrum of MTT68, we can confirm the previous finding in the NIR of the only
other Galactic exemplar (besides HD93129A) of the O2If* type known to date.
Based on its position relative to a set of theoretical isochrons in a
Hertzprung-Russel diagram, we concluded that the new O2If* star could be one of
the most massive (150 Msun) and luminous (Mv=-7.3) O-star in the Galaxy. Also,
another remarkable result is the discovery of a new O2V star (MTT31) that is
the first exemplar of the class so far identified in the Milk Way. From its
position in the Hertzprung-Russel diagram it is found that this new star
probably had an initial mass of 80 Msun, as well as an absolute magnitude
Mv=-6.0 corresponding to a luminosity similar to other known O2V stars in the
LMC. We also communicate the discovery of a new Galactic O3.5If* star (RFS8)
which case is quite intriguing. Indeed, It is located far to the south of the
NGC 3603 center, in apparent isolation at a large radial projected linear
distance of 62 pc. Its derived luminosity is similar to that of the other
O3.5If* (Sh18) found in the NGC 3603's innermost region. The fact that a such
high mass star is observed far isolated in the field led us to speculate that
perhaps it could have been expelled from the innermost parts of the complex by
a close fly-by dynamical encounter with a very massive hard binary system.

impedance, magnetic surface admittance, and magnetoelectric coupling
coefficient, were previously considered for wavefront manipulation. However,
previous reports mainly considered plane-wave excitations, and implementations
included cumbersome metallic features. In this work, we prove that any field
transformation which locally conserves real power can be implemented via
passive and lossless meta-atoms characterized by closed-form expressions; this
allows rigorous incorporation of arbitrary source and scattering
configurations. Subsequently, we show that O-BMS meta-atoms can be implemented
using an asymmetric stack of three impedance sheets, an appealing structure for
printed circuit board fabrication. Our formulation reveals that, as opposed to
Huygens' metasurfaces (HMSs), which exhibit negligible magnetoelectric
coupling, O-BMSs are not limited to controlling the phase of transmitted
fields, but can rather achieve high level of control over the amplitude and
phase of reflected fields. This is demonstrated by designing O-BMSs for
reflectionless wide-angle refraction, independent surface-wave guiding, and a
highly-directive low-profile antenna, verified with full-wave simulations. This
straightforward methodology facilitates development of O-BMS-based devices for

composed of a precursor and the main superoutburst. The precursor outburst
occurred at least 5 d before the maximum of the main superoutburst. Despite
this separation, long-period superhumps were continuously seen between the
precursor and main superoutburst. The period of these superhumps is longer than
the orbital period by 6.0(1)% and can be interpreted to reflect the dynamical
precession rate at the 3:1 resonance for a mass ratio of 0.172(4). These
superhumps smoothly evolved into those in the main superoutburst. These
observations provide the clearest evidence that the 3:1 resonance is triggered
by the precursor outburst, even if it is well separated, and the resonance
eventually causes the main superoutburst as predicted by the thermal-tidal
instability model. The presence of superhumps well before the superoutburst
cannot be explained by alternative models (the enhanced mass-transfer model and
the pure thermal instability model) and the present observations give a clear
support to the thermal-tidal instability model.

propose a statistical procedure that uses commonly available network and

that non-friends don't influence users; thus, comparing how a user's activity
correlates with friends versus non-friends who have similar preferences can
help tease out the effect of copy-influence.
  Experiments on datasets from multiple social networks show that estimates
that don't account for homophily overestimate copy-influence by varying, often
large amounts. Further, copy-influence estimates fall below 1% of total actions
in all networks: most people, and almost all actions, are not affected by the
feed. Our results question common perceptions around the extent of
copy-influence in online social networks and suggest improvements to diffusion

delta function at the origin. The usual textbook derivation of this delta
function is rather ad hoc and cannot be used to calculate the delta-function
structure for higher multipole moments. Moreover, a naive application of
Gauss's law to the ideal dipole field appears to give an incorrect expression
for the dipole's effective charge density. We derive a general result for the
delta-function structure at the origin of an arbitrary ideal multipole field
without using any advanced techniques from distribution theory. We find that
the divergence of a singular vector field can contain a $\textit{derivative}$
of a Dirac delta function even if the field itself does not contain a delta

observed in CO(1-0), 47 are detected with S/N>3. A large fraction (37-46%) of
our CO-SPOG sample were visually classified as morphologically disrupted. The
H2 masses detected were between 10^(8.7-10.8) Msuns, consistent with the gas
masses found in normal galaxies, though approximately an order of magnitude
larger than the range seen in poststarburst galaxies. When comparing the 22um

22um fluxes in excess by a factor of <EMIR,SPOG>=4.91+0.42-0.39. The Na I D
characteristics of CO-SPOGs show that it is likely that many of these objects
host interstellar winds. Objects with the large Na I D enhancements also tend
to emit in the radio, suggesting possible AGN-driving of neutral winds.

phenomena is important to understand underlying mechanisms behind such complex
systems, hence even to predict and control them. Temporal inhomogeneities in
event sequences have been described in terms of bursts that are rapidly
occurring events in short time periods alternating with long inactive periods.
The bursts can be quantified by a simple measure, called burstiness parameter,
which was introduced by Goh and Barab\'asi [EPL \textbf{81}, 48002 (2008)]. The
burstiness parameter has been widely used due to its simplicity, which however
turns out to be strongly affected by the finite number of events in the time
series. As the finite-size effects on burstiness parameter have been largely
ignored, we analytically investigate the finite-size effects of the burstiness
parameter. Then we suggest an alternative definition of burstiness that is free
from finite-size effects and yet simple. Using our alternative burstiness
measure, one can distinguish the finite-size effects from the intrinsic bursty
properties in the time series. We also demonstrate the advantages of our
burstiness measure by analyzing empirical datasets.

Carlo global radiation transport code, which determines the X-ray flux
irradiating the disk surface and the coronal electron temperature
self-consistently. With that irradiating flux and the disk's density structure
drawn from the simulation, we determine the reprocessed Fe K$\alpha$ emission
from photoionization equilibrium and solution of the radiation transfer
equation. We produce maps of the surface brightness of Fe K$\alpha$ emission
over the disk surface, which---for our example of a $10 M_\odot$, Schwarzschild
black hole accreting at $1\%$ the Eddington value---rises steeply one
gravitational radius outside the radius of the innermost stable circular orbit
and then falls $\propto r^{-2}$ at larger radii. We explain these features of
the Fe K$\alpha$ radial surface brightness profile as consequences of the
disk's ionization structure and an extended coronal geometry, respectively. We
also present the corresponding Fe K$\alpha$ line profiles as would be seen by
distant observers at several inclinations. Both the shapes of the line profiles

similar to those typically observed from accreting black holes. Most
importantly, this work represents a direct link between theory and observation:

conformity in color between bright galaxies and their faint companions
(color-color slope significance S ~ 2.73 sigma and correlation coefficient cc ~
0.50) in A2, where the cluster-scale environmental dependence is almost
negligible. On the other hand, the conformity is not significant or very
marginal (S ~ 1.75 sigma and cc ~ 0.27) in A1. The conformity is not
significant either in A3 (S ~ 1.59 sigma and cc ~ 0.44), but the sample size is
too small in this area. These results are consistent with a scenario in which
the small-scale conformity in a cluster is a vestige of infallen groups and
these groups lose conformity as they come closer to the cluster center.

focused on exact diagonalization of the full Hamiltonian for small systems

apply on larger systems. We propose making an approximation by using only a
subspace of the full Hilbert space spanned by low-lying excitations consisting
of one-spin flipped and two-spin flipped states. The approximation procedure is
carried out within the theoretical framework of Hartree-Fock approximation and
Configuration Interaction. Although not exact, our approach allows us to study
larger system sizes comparable to that achievable by state of the art Quantum
Monte Carlo simulations. We calculate two quantities of interest due to recent
advances in quantum annealing, the ground-state energy and the energy gap
between the ground and first excited state. For the energy gap, we derive a
novel formula that enables it to be calculated using just the ground-state
wavefunction, thereby circumventing the need to diagonalize the Hamiltonian. We
calculate the scalings of the energy gap and the leading correction to the
extensive part of the ground-state energy with system size, which are difficult

exploring various ways of connecting the visual and text domains. This paper
revisits this idea by stepping further to consider one important factor: the
textual representation is usually too noisy for the zero-shot learning
application. This consideration motivates us to design a simple-but-effective
zero-shot learning method capable of suppressing noise in the text.
  More specifically, we propose an $l_{2,1}$-norm based objective function
which can simultaneously suppress the noisy signal in the text and learn a
function to match the text document and visual features. We also develop an
optimization algorithm to efficiently solve the resulting problem. By
conducting experiments on two large datasets, we demonstrate that the proposed

in-depth analysis of the proposed method and provide insight as to what kind of

stochastic optimization or sampling average approximation, fail to learn
exploitable patterns from collected data and require an excessive number of
objective function evaluations. There is a need for techniques that alleviate
the high cost of information acquisition and select sequential simulations
optimally. In the field of deterministic single-objective unconstrained global
optimization, the Bayesian global optimization (BGO) approach has been
relatively successful in addressing the information acquisition problem. BGO
builds a probabilistic surrogate of the expensive objective function and uses
it to define an information acquisition function (IAF) whose role is to
quantify the merit of making new objective evaluations. Specifically, BGO
iterates between making the observations with the largest expected IAF and
rebuilding the probabilistic surrogate, until a convergence criterion is met.
In this work, we extend the expected improvement (EI) IAF to the case of design
optimization under uncertainty wherein the EI policy is reformulated to filter
out parametric and measurement uncertainties. To increase the robustness of our
approach in the low sample regime, we employ a fully Bayesian interpretation of
Gaussian processes by constructing a particle approximation of the posterior of
its hyperparameters using adaptive Markov chain Monte Carlo. We verify and
validate our approach by solving two synthetic optimization problems under
uncertainty and demonstrate it by solving the oil-well-placement problem with
uncertainties in the permeability field and the oil price time series.

Nb films with periodically arranged nanogrooves is studied via four-probe

modeling. The nanogrooves are milled by focused ion beam and induce a symmetric
pinning potential of the washboard type. The resistivity tensor of the films is
determined in the limit of small current densities at temperatures close to the
critical temperature for the fundamental matching configuration of the vortex
lattice with respect to the pinning nanolandscape. The angle between the
current direction with respect to the grooves is set at seven fixed values
between $0^\circ$ and $90^\circ$. A sign change is observed in the temperature
dependence of the Hall resistivity $\rho_\perp^-$ of as-grown films in a narrow
temperature range near $T_c$. By contrast, for all nanopatterned films
$\rho_\perp^-$ is nonzero in a broader temperature range below $T_c$, allowing
us to discriminate between two contributions in $\rho_\perp^-$, namely one
contribution originating from the guided vortex motion and the other one caused
by the Hall anomaly just as in as-grown Nb films. All four measured resistivity
components are successfully fitted to analytical expressions derived within the
framework of a stochastic model of competing isotropic and anisotropic pinning.
This provides evidence of the model validity for the description of the
resistive response of superconductor thin films with washboard pinning
nanolandscapes.

present paper we study quasi-classical generalized F and CRF structures, which
may be seen as a generalization of the holomorphic Poisson structures (it is
well known that the latter may also be defined via generalized geometry). The
structures that we study are equivalent to a pair of tensor fields $(A\in
End(TM),\pi\in\wedge^2TM)$ where $A^3+A=0$ and some relations between $A$ and
$\pi$ hold. We establish the integrability conditions in terms of $(A,\pi)$.
They include the facts that $A$ is a classical CRF structure, $\pi$ is a
Poisson bivector field and $im\,A$ is a (non)holonomic Poisson submanifold of
$(M,\pi)$. We discuss the case where either $ker\,A$ or $im\,A$ is tangent to a
foliation and, in particular, the case of almost contact manifolds. Finally, we
show that the dual bundle of $im\,A$ inherits a Lie algebroid structure and we
briefly discuss the Poisson cohomology of $\pi$, including an associated
spectral sequence and a Dolbeault type grading.

  Programming","frequent sequence mining, constraint programming",,,,"cs.DB cs.AI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The main advantage of Constraint Programming (CP) approaches for sequential
pattern mining (SPM) is their modularity, which includes the ability to add new
constraints (regular expressions, length restrictions, etc). The current best
CP approach for SPM uses a global constraint (module) that computes the
projected database and enforces the minimum frequency; it does this with a
filtering algorithm similar to the PrefixSpan method. However, the resulting
system is not as scalable as some of the most advanced mining systems like
Zaki's cSPADE. We show how, using techniques from both data mining and CP, one
can use a generic constraint solver and yet outperform existing specialized
systems. This is mainly due to two improvements in the module that computes the
projected frequencies: first, computing the projected database can be sped up
by pre-computing the positions at which an symbol can become unsupported by a
sequence, thereby avoiding to scan the full sequence each time; and second by
taking inspiration from the trailing used in CP solvers to devise a
backtracking-aware data structure that allows fast incremental storing and
restoring of the projected database. Detailed experiments show how this
approach outperforms existing CP as well as specialized systems for SPM, and
that the gain in efficiency translates directly into increased efficiency for
other settings such as mining with regular expressions.

problem in discrete geometry. A convex body $K$ of diameter $\mathrm{diam}(K)$
is given in Euclidean $d$-dimensional space, where $d$ is a constant. Given an
error parameter $\varepsilon > 0$, the objective is to determine a polytope of
minimum combinatorial complexity whose Hausdorff distance from $K$ is at most
$\varepsilon \cdot \mathrm{diam}(K)$. By combinatorial complexity we mean the
total number of faces of all dimensions of the polytope. A well-known result by
Dudley implies that $O(1/\varepsilon^{(d-1)/2})$ facets suffice, and a dual
result by Bronshteyn and Ivanov similarly bounds the number of vertices, but
neither result bounds the total combinatorial complexity. We show that there
exists an approximating polytope whose total combinatorial complexity is
$\tilde{O}(1/\varepsilon^{(d-1)/2})$, where $\tilde{O}$ conceals a
polylogarithmic factor in $1/\varepsilon$. This is a significant improvement
upon the best known bound, which is roughly $O(1/\varepsilon^{d-2})$.
  Our result is based on a novel combination of both old and new ideas. First,
we employ Macbeath regions, a classical structure from the theory of convexity.
The construction of our approximating polytope employs a new stratified
placement of these regions. Second, in order to analyze the combinatorial
complexity of the approximating polytope, we present a tight analysis of a
width-based variant of B\'{a}r\'{a}ny and Larman's economical cap covering.
Finally, we use a deterministic adaptation of the witness-collector technique

construction.

efficiently whether $q \in K$. We consider this problem in an approximate

ability to describe the randomness of number and values of objects, as well as
the statistical correlation between objects. Due to its comprehensive nature,
it usually has a complicate mathematical structure making the set integral
suffering from the curse of dimension and the combinatorial nature of the

theme in point process theory or finite set statistics (FISST). Conventional
approaches usually discard part or all of statistical correlation mechanically

observed quantities. If the relative uncertainties on measurements are small
enough, uncertainties can be propagated analytically using simplifying
assumptions, but for large normally distributed uncertainties, the probability
distribution of the ratio become skewed, with a modal value offset from that
expected in Gaussian uncertainty propagation. Furthermore, the most likely
value of a ratio A/B is not equal to the reciprocal of the most likely value of
B/A. The effect is most pronounced when the uncertainty on the denominator is
larger than that on the numerator.
  We show that this effect is seen in an analysis of 12,126 spectra from the
Sloan Digital Sky Survey. The intrinsically fixed ratio of the [O III] lines at
4959 and 5007 ${\AA}$ is conventionally expressed as the ratio of the stronger
line to the weaker line. Thus, the uncertainty on the denominator is larger,
and non-Gaussian probability distributions result. By taking this effect into
account, we derive an improved estimate of the intrinsic 5007/4959 ratio. We
obtain a value of 3.012 $\pm$ 0.008, which is slightly but statistically
significantly higher than the theoretical value of 2.98.
  We further investigate the suggestion that fluxes measured from emission
lines at low signal to noise are strongly biased upwards. We were unable to
detect this effect in the SDSS line flux measurements, and we could not
reproduce the results of Rola and Pelat who first described this bias. We
suggest that the magnitude of this effect may depend strongly on the specific

  We investigate the properties of the two already known kinematic components

low-intensity high-velocity (absolute RV $>$50 km/s) gas emission.

from [S II] doublet ratios. The spatial variation of N ionization is also

evident found around $\eta$ Car, the Trumpler 14 core, and the star WR25. Such
""shells"" are non-spherical, and show distortions probably caused by collisions

  We propose NEAT, a test for network enrichment analysis. The test is based on
the hypergeometric distribution, which naturally arises as the null
distribution in this context. NEAT can be applied not only to undirected, but
to directed and partially directed networks as well. Our simulations indicate
that NEAT is considerably faster than alternative resampling-based methods, and
that its capacity to detect enrichments is at least as good as the one of
alternative tests. We discuss applications of NEAT to network analyses in yeast
by testing for enrichment of the Environmental Stress Response target gene set
with GO Slim and KEGG functional gene sets, and also by testing for
associations between GO Slim categories themselves.
  NEAT is a flexible and efficient test for network enrichment analysis that
aims to overcome some limitations of existing resampling-based tests. The
method is implemented in the R package neat, which can be freely downloaded

between properties of the product of closed order intervals in C(K) and

seen from the fact that, if K is the Stone-Cech compactification of N, then the
product of two intervals in C(K) with continuous boundary functions is always
an interval. For any K, it is proved that the product of two positive intervals

instanton QCD-vacuum configuration in which $\mathrm{SU}(3)$ flavor symmetry is
explicitly broken by the current quark mass $(m_{u,d},m_s)\approx(5,135)$ MeV.
To compute $\chi_t$, the local topological charge density operator $Q_t(x)$ is
derived from the effective partition function of NL$\chi$QM. We take into
account the contributions from the leading-order (LO) ones
$\sim\mathcal{O}(N_c)$ in the $1/N_c$ expansion. We also verify that the
analytical expression of $\chi_t$ in NL$\chi$QM satisfy the Witten-Veneziano
(WV) and the Leutwyler-Smilga (LS) formulae. Once the average instanton size
and inter-instanton distance are fixed with $\bar{\rho}=1/3$ fm and $\bar{R}=1$
fm, respectively, all the associated model parameters are all determined
self-consistently within the model, including the $\eta$ and $\eta'$ weak decay
constants. We obtain the results such as $F_{\eta}=96.77$ MeV and
$F_{\eta'}=102.53$ MeV for instance. Numerically we observe that
$\chi_{t}=(165.57\,\mathrm{MeV})^4$ in our full calculation. This value is
comparable with its empirical one $\chi_t=(175\pm5\,\mathrm{MeV})^4$. We also
find that our $\chi^\mathrm{WV}_t=\chi^\mathrm{QL}_t=(194.30,\mathrm{MeV})^4$

being actively explored to provide potential solutions of device
miniaturization and scaling in the more-than-MOORE era. Amongst these
alternatives, spintronics physics and devices have recently attracted a rapidly
increasing interest by exploiting the additional degree of electron's spins.
For example, magnetic domain-wall racetrack-memory and logic devices have been
realized via manipulating domain-wall motion. As compared to domain-wall based
devices, magnetic skyrmions have the advantages of ultra-small size (typically
5-100 nm in diameter), facile current-driven motion, topological stability and
peculiar emergent electrodynamics, promising for next-generation electronics
applications in the more-than-Moore regime. In this work, a magnetic meron
diode, which behaves like a PN-junction diode, is demonstrated for the first
time, by tailoring the current-controlled unidirectional motion of edge-merons
(i.e., fractional skyrmions) in a nanotrack with interfacial
Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction. The working principles of the meron diode,
theoretically expected from the Thiele equation for topological magnetic
objects, are further verified by micromagnetic simulations. The present study
reveals topology-independent transport property of magnetic objects, and is
expected to open the vista toward integrated composite circuitry, with unified
data storage and processing, based on a single magnetic chip, as the meron
diode can be used either, as a building block, to develop complex logic
components or, as a signal controller, to interconnect skyrmion, domain-wall,

rejected subject to constraints. We then measure times of network assembly and
compare these to empirical data about the age of acquisition of words. In

distances between images and users in the latent space are calculated to make
decisions. We further propose a comparative deep learning (CDL) method to train
the deep network, using a pair of images compared against one user to learn the
pattern of their relative distances. The CDL embraces much more training data
than naive deep learning, and thus achieves superior performance than the
latter, with no cost of increasing network complexity. Experimental results
with real-world data sets for image recommendations have shown the proposed
dual-net network and CDL greatly outperform other state-of-the-art image
recommendation solutions.

solutions to optimal control, a regularization term with coefficient
$\varepsilon$ must be included in the cost functional. Assuming $\varepsilon$

The process of extracting features is highly linked to dimensionality reduction

Neural Networks for distributed paragraph representations, and Latent Dirichlet
Allocation to capture higher level features of paragraph vectors. Although

resources and computational power, which discourages applications to process
any task other than measuring and transmitting towards a central server.
However, nowadays, sensor networks tend to be incorporated into the Internet of
Things and the hardware evolution may change the old strategy of avoiding data
computation in the sensor nodes. In this paper, we show the importance of
reducing the number of transmissions in sensor networks and present the use of
forecasting methods as a way of doing it. Experiments using real sensor data
show that state-of-the-art forecasting methods can be successfully implemented
in the sensor nodes to keep the quality of their measurements and reduce up to
30% of their transmissions, lowering the channel utilization. We conclude that
there is an old paradigm that is no longer the most beneficial, which is the
strategy of always transmitting a measurement when it differs by more than a
threshold from the last one transmitted. Adopting more complex forecasting
methods in the sensor nodes is the alternative to significantly reduce the
number of transmissions without compromising the quality of their measurements,
and therefore support the exponential growth of the Internet of Things.

spectroscopic survey, of a metal-poor ([Fe/H] $= -1.3$ dex) field giant star
with an extreme Mg-Al abundance ratio ([Mg/Fe] $= -0.31$ dex; [Al/Fe] $= 1.49$
dex). Such low Mg/Al ratios are seen only among the second-generation
population of globular clusters, and are not present among Galactic disk field
stars. The light element abundances of this star, 2M16011638-1201525, suggest
that it could have been born in a globular cluster. We explore several origin
scenarios, in particular studying the orbit of the star to check the
probability of it being kinematically related to known globular clusters. We
performed simple orbital integrations assuming the estimated distance of
2M16011638-1201525 and the available six-dimensional phase-space coordinates of
63 globular clusters, looking for close encounters in the past with a minimum
distance approach within the tidal radius of each cluster. We found a very low
probability that 2M16011638-1201525 was ejected from most globular clusters;
however, we note that the best progenitor candidate to host this star is
globular cluster $\omega$ Centauri (NGC 5139). Our dynamical investigation
demonstrates that 2M16011638-1201525 reaches a distance $|Z_{max}| < 3 $ kpc
from the Galactic plane and a minimum and maximum approach to the Galactic
center of $R_{min}<0.62$ kpc and $R_{max}<7.26$ kpc in an eccentric
($e\sim0.53$) and retrograde orbit. Since the extreme chemical anomaly of
2M16011638-1201525 has also been observed in halo field stars, this object
could also be considered a halo contaminant, likely been ejected into the Milky
Way disk from the halo. We conclude that, 2M16011638-20152 is also
kinematically consistent with the disk but chemically consistent with halo
field stars.

We find that the so-called funnel effect, i.e. the possibility of controlling

excitons accumulating isotropically around regions of high tensile strain like
in MoS$_2$, excitons in BP are pushed away from said regions. This
\emph{inverse} funnel effect is moreover highly anisotropic, with much larger
funnel distances along the armchair crystallographic direction, leading to a
directional focusing of exciton flow. A strong inverse funnel effect could
enable simpler designs of funnel solar cells, and offer new possibilities for

the effect of pair-wise interactions can be made small or zero starting from
the realization that collisions occur at the zero-point energy of an optical

effective-range contributions. We determine the strength of the two- and
three-body interactions for scattering from van-der-Waals potentials and near
Fano-Feshbach resonances. For van-der-Waals potentials, which for example
describe scattering of alkaline-earth atoms, we find that the pair-wise
interaction can only be turned off for species with a small negative scattering
length, leaving the $^{88}$Sr isotope a possible candidate. Interestingly, for
collisional magnetic Feshbach resonances this restriction does not apply and
there often exist magnetic fields where the two-body interaction is small. We
illustrate this result for several known narrow resonances between alkali-metal

  We study the effect of major implementation decisions on the performance of

benchmark on x86-64 was improved by $\textbf{3.1}$ times after moving from a
stack based virtual machine to a register-transfer architecture, a further
$\textbf{1.5}$ times by adding byte code combining, a further $\textbf{2.3}$

performance improvement of about $\textbf{47}$ times. To put these results in

planets has recently evolved with the idea that ""pebbles"", centimeter- to
meter-sized icy grains migrating in protoplanetary disks, can control
planetesimal and/or planetary growth.
  Aims. We investigate how pebble accretion depends on disk properties and
affects the formation of planetary systems
  Methods. We construct analytical models of pebble accretion onto planetary
embryos that consistently account for the mass and orbital evolution of the
pebble flow and reflect disk structure.
  Results. We derive simple formulas for pebble accretion rates in the
so-called ""settling"" regime for planetary embryos with more than 100 km in
size. For relatively smaller embryos or in outer disk regions, the accretion
mode is 3D, meaning that the thickness of the pebble flow must be taken into
account, and resulting in an accretion rate that is independent of the embryo
mass. For larger embryos or in inner regions, the accretion is in a 2D mode,
i.e., the pebble disk may be considered to be infinitely thin. We show that the
radial dependence of the pebble accretion rata is different (even the sign of
the power-law exponent changes) for different disk conditions such as the disk
heating source (viscous heating or stellar irradiation), the drag law (Stokes
or Epstein, and weak or strong coupling), and in the 2D or 3D accretion modes.
We also discuss the effect of the sublimation/destruction of icy pebbles inside
the snow line.
  Conclusions. Pebble accretion easily produces a large diversity of planetary
systems. In other words, to correctly infer the results of planet formation
through pebble accretion, detailed prescriptions of disk evolution and pebble
growth, sublimation/destruction and migration are required.

jointly distributed memoryless process, denoted by $X^n=(X_1,\dots,X_n)$ and
$Y^n=(Y_1,\dots,Y_n)$, out of two possible probability measures on finite
alphabets, namely $P_{XY}$ and $P_{\bar{X}\bar{Y}}$. The marginal samples given
by $X^n$ and $Y^n$ are assumed to be available at different locations. The
statisticians are allowed to exchange limited amount of data over multiple
rounds of interactions, which differs from previous work that deals mainly with
unidirectional communication. A single round of interaction is considered
before the result is generalized to any finite number of communication rounds.
A feasibility result is shown, guaranteeing the feasibility of an error
exponent for general hypotheses, through information-theoretic methods. The
special case of testing against independence is revisited as being an instance
of this result for which also an unfeasibility result is proven. A second
special case is studied where zero-rate communication is imposed (data
exchanges grow sub-exponentially with $n$) for which it is shown that
interaction does not improve asymptotic performance.

using other optical lines. Aims. To detect activity cycles in solar-analog
stars and determine if these can be identified through other optical lines,
such as Fe II and Balmer lines. We study the solar-analog star HD 45184.
Methods. We analyse the activity signatures of HD 45184 by using 291 HARPS
spectra obtained between 2003 and 2014. In order to search for line-core fluxes
variations, we focus on Ca II H&K and Balmer H$\alpha$, H$\beta$ lines, which
are usually used as optical chromospheric activity indicators. We calculate the
HARPS-S index from Ca II H&K lines and convert it to the Mount-Wilson scale. In
addition, we also consider as activity indicators the equivalent widths of
Balmer lines. Moreover, we analyse the possible variability of Fe II and other
metallic lines in the optical spectra. Results. We report for the first time a
long-term 5.14-yr activity cycle in the solar-analog star HD 45184. This makes
HD 45184 one of most similar stars to the Sun with known activity cycle. Such
variation is also evident in the first lines of the Balmer series, which not
always show a correlation with activity in solar-type stars. Notably, unlike
the solar case, we also found that the equivalent widths of the high
photospheric Fe II lines (4924 \AA, 5018 {\AA} and 5169 \AA) are modulated
($\pm$ 2 m\AA) by the chromospheric cycle of the star. From short-term
modulation of the S index we calculate a rotational period of 19.98 days, which
agrees with its mean chromospheric activity level.

characterized by a purely dissipative optomechanical coupling; only in the

Here, we numerically address the skyrmion-domain wall collision in a magnetic

theories of gravity, around homogeneous and isotropic backgrounds. The method
is sufficiently general and systematic that it can be applied to theories with
any degrees of freedom (DoFs) and arbitrary gauge symmetries. In this paper, we
focus on scalar-tensor and vector-tensor theories, invariant under linear
coordinate transformations. In the case of scalar-tensor theories, we use our
framework to recover the simple parametrizations of linearized Horndeski and
""Beyond Horndeski"" theories, and also find higher-derivative corrections. In
the case of vector-tensor theories, we first construct the most general
quadratic action for perturbations that leads to second-order equations of
motion, which propagates two scalar DoFs. Then we specialize to the case in
which the vector field is time-like (\`a la Einstein-Aether gravity), where the
theory only propagates one scalar DoF. As a result, we identify the complete
forms of the quadratic actions for perturbations, and the number of free
parameters that need to be defined, to cosmologically characterize these two
broad classes of theories.

and/or design constraints, such that a perfectly homogeneous mixture cannot be
obtained in finite time. Here, we address the natural corollary question: Given
the best available mixer, what is the optimal initial tracer pattern that leads
to the most homogeneous mixture after a prescribed finite time? For ideal
passive tracers, we show that this optimal initial condition coincides with the
right singular vector (corresponding to the smallest singular value) of a
suitably truncated Perron-Frobenius (PF) operator. The truncation of the PF
operator is made under the assumption that there is a small length-scale
threshold $\ell_\nu$ under which the tracer blobs are considered, for all
practical purposes, completely mixed. We demonstrate our results on two
examples: a prototypical model known as the sine flow and a direct numerical
simulation of two-dimensional turbulence. Evaluating the optimal initial
condition through this framework only requires the position of a dense grid of
fluid particles at the final instance and their preimages at the initial
instance of the prescribed time interval. As such, our framework can be readily
applied to flows where such data is available through numerical simulations or
experimental measurements.

other set is gauge-invariant and represents polarized neutrinos. We show that a

and small components. The large components are gauge invariant, while the small
components are not. These small components represent spin-$\frac{1}{2}$
non-zero mass particles. If we renormalize the large components, these gauge
invariant spinors again represent the polarization of neutrinos. Massive
neutrinos cannot be invariant under gauge transformations.

domino effect of cascading failures, which can lead to the isolation of a large
number of consumers or even to the failure of the entire grid. Here we present
results of the simulation of cascading failures in power grids, using an
alternating current (AC) model. We first apply this model to a regular square
grid topology. For a random placement of consumers and generators on the grid,
the probability to find more than a certain number of unsupplied consumers
decays as a power law and obeys a scaling law with respect to system size.
Varying the transmitted power threshold above which a transmission line fails
does not seem to change the power law exponent $q \approx 1.6$. Furthermore, we
study the influence of the placement of generators and consumers on the number
of affected consumers and demonstrate that large clusters of generators and
consumers are especially vulnerable to cascading failures. As a real-world
topology we consider the German high-voltage transmission grid. Applying the
dynamic AC model and considering a random placement of consumers, we find that
the probability to disconnect more than a certain number of consumers depends
strongly on the threshold. For large thresholds the decay is clearly
exponential, while for small ones the decay is slow, indicating a power law
decay.
