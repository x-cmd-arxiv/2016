These results support the idea that the origin of at least some of the photon

citation counts with respect to field-specific citation patterns. The best
known system is the so-called ""Web-of-Science Subject Categories"" (WCs). In
other systems papers are classified by algorithmic solutions. Using the Journal
Citation Reports 2014 of the Science Citation Index and the Social Science
Citation Index (n of journals = 11,149), we examine options for developing a
new system based on journal classifications into subject categories using
aggregated journal-journal citation data. Combining routines in VOSviewer and
Pajek, a tree-like classification is developed. At each level one can generate
a map of science for all the journals subsumed under a category. Nine major
fields are distinguished at the top level. Further decomposition of the social
sciences is pursued for the sake of example with a focus on journals in
information science (LIS) and science studies (STS). The new classification
system improves on alternative options by avoiding the problem of randomness in
each run that has made algorithmic solutions hitherto irreproducible.
Limitations of the new system are discussed (e.g. the classification of
multi-disciplinary journals). The system's usefulness for field-normalization
in bibliometrics should be explored in future studies.

at a certain magnetic field, (SdHO). Thus, from a physical standpoint, what the

the oscillating nature of the Landau states subjected to radiation and, on the

thoroughly investigated, both separately and as a joint task. Estimating the
support of a set of signals and their DOAs is crucial to many signal processing
applications, such as Cognitive Radio (CR). A challenging scenario, faced by
CRs, is that of multiband signals, composed of several narrowband transmissions
spread over a wide spectrum each with unknown carrier frequencies and DOAs. The
Nyquist rate of such signals is high and constitutes a bottleneck both in the
analog and digital domains. To alleviate the sampling rate issue, several
sub-Nyquist sampling methods, such as multicoset sampling or the modulated
wideband converter (MWC), have been proposed in the context of spectrum
sensing. In this work, we first suggest an alternative sub-Nyquist sampling and
signal reconstruction method to the MWC, based on a uniform linear array (ULA).
We then extend our approach to joint spectrum sensing and DOA estimation and
propose the CompreSsed CArrier and DOA Estimation (CaSCADE) system, composed of
an L-shaped array with two ULAs. In both cases, we derive perfect recovery
conditions of the signal parameters (carrier frequencies and DOAs if relevant)
and the signal itself and provide two reconstruction algorithms, one based on
the ESPRIT method and the second on compressed sensing techniques. Both our
joint carriers and DOAs recovery algorithms overcome the well-known pairing
issue between the two parameters. Simulations demonstrate that our alternative
spectrum sensing system outperforms the MWC in terms of recovery error and
design complexity and show joint carrier frequencies and DOAs from our CaSCADE
system's sub-Nyquist samples.

  estimation with stationary functional time series",,,,,"stat.CO math.ST stat.TH","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In arenas of application including environmental science, economics, and
medicine, it is increasingly common to consider time series of curves or
functions. Many inferential procedures employed in the analysis of such data
involve the long run covariance function or operator, which is analogous to the
long run covariance matrix familiar to finite dimensional time series analysis
and econometrics. This function may be naturally estimated using a smoothed
periodogram type estimator evaluated at frequency zero that relies crucially on
the choice of a bandwidth parameter. Motivated by a number of prior
contributions in the finite dimensional setting, we propose a bandwidth
selection method that aims to minimize the estimator's asymptotic mean squared
normed error (AMSNE) in $L^2[0,1]^2$. As the AMSNE depends on unknown
population quantities including the long run covariance function itself,
estimates for these are plugged in in an initial step after which the estimated
AMSNE can be minimized to produce an empirical optimal bandwidth. We show that
the bandwidth produced in this way is asymptotically consistent with the AMSNE
optimal bandwidth, with quantifiable rates, under mild stationarity and moment
conditions. These results and the efficacy of the proposed methodology are
evaluated by means of a comprehensive simulation study, from which we can offer
practical advice on how to select the bandwidth parameter in this setting.

value lower 0.3 eV where often fast O$_2$ dissociation easily occurs. Our
results show that, even though it is difficult to disentangle the geometrical

microbiota. In a few well-studied cases, bacterial communities have been
observed to coordinate their metabolic fluxes. In principle, bacteria can
divide tasks to reap the benefits of specialization, as in human economies.
However, the benefits and stability of an economy of bacterial specialists are
far from obvious. Here, we physically model the population dynamics of bacteria
that compete for steadily supplied resources. Importantly, we explicitly model
the metabolic fluxes yielding cellular biomass production under the constraint
of a limited enzyme budget. In our framework, we find that population dynamics
generally leads to the coexistence of different metabolic types, which satisfy
an extended competitive exclusion principle (even allowing for adaptive
mutation). We establish that these consortia act as cartels, whereby population
dynamics pins down resource concentrations at values for which no other
strategy can invade. Finally, we propose that at steady supply, cartels of
competing strategies automatically yield maximum biomass, thereby achieving a
collective optimum.

To
help users share links to online documents, maps, etc., several services,
including cloud storage providers such as Microsoft OneDrive and mapping
services such as Google Maps, directly integrate URL shorteners that convert
long, unwieldy URLs into short URLs, consisting of a domain such as 1drv.ms or
goo.gl and a short token.
  In this paper, we demonstrate that the space of 5- and 6-character tokens
included in short URLs is so small that it can be scanned using brute-force
search. Therefore, all online resources that were intended to be shared with a
few trusted friends or collaborators are effectively public and can be accessed
by anyone. This leads to serious security and privacy vulnerabilities.
  In the case of cloud storage, we focus on Microsoft OneDrive. We show how to
use short-URL enumeration to discover and read shared content stored in the
OneDrive cloud, including even files for which the user did not generate a
short URL. 7% of the OneDrive accounts exposed in this fashion allow anyone to
write into them. Since cloud-stored files are automatically copied into users'
personal computers and devices, this is a vector for large-scale, automated
malware injection.
  In the case of online maps, we show how short-URL enumeration reveals the
directions that users shared with each other. For many individual users, this
enables inference of their residential addresses, true identities, and
extremely sensitive locations they visited that, if publicly revealed, would
violate medical and financial privacy.

computation for probabilistic inference. We present formulations of inference
problems in Markov random fields (MRFs) as computation of equilibria in a
certain class of game-theoretic graphical models. We concretely establishes the
precise connection between variational probabilistic inference in MRFs and
correlated equilibria. No previous work exploits recent theoretical and
empirical results from the literature on algorithmic and computational game
theory on the tractable, polynomial-time computation of exact or approximate
correlated equilibria in graphical games with arbitrary, loopy graph structure.
We discuss how to design new algorithms with equally tractable guarantees for
the computation of approximate variational inference in MRFs. Also, inspired by
a previously stated game-theoretic view of state-of-the-art tree-reweighed

propose a different, general-sum potential game to design approximate
fictitious-play techniques. We perform synthetic experiments evaluating our

associated with the breaking of a target symmetry by the lattice regulator; in
this case we argue that the target symmetry is the general coordinate
invariance of the theory. After introducing and fine-tuning a nontrivial local
measure term, we find no barrier to taking a continuum limit, and we find
evidence that four-dimensional, semiclassical geometries are recovered at long
distance scales in the continuum limit. We also find that the spectral
dimension at short distance scales is consistent with 3/2, a value that could
resolve the tension between asymptotic safety and the holographic entropy
scaling of black holes. We argue that the number of relevant couplings in the
continuum theory is one, once symmetry breaking by the lattice regulator is
accounted for. Such a theory is maximally predictive, with no adjustable
parameters. The cosmological constant in Planck units is the only relevant
parameter, which serves to set the lattice scale. The cosmological constant in
Planck units is of order 1 in the ultraviolet and undergoes renormalization
group running to small values in the infrared. If these findings hold up under
further scrutiny, the lattice may provide a nonperturbative definition of a
renormalizable quantum field theory of general relativity with no adjustable
parameters and a cosmological constant that is naturally small in the infrared.

physical costs of the reconstruction process including computation time,

symbols on a grid, which change according to a locally determined transition
rule. In this paper, we will consider cellular automata that arise from
polynomial transition rules, where the symbols in the automaton are integers
modulo some prime $p$. We are principally concerned with the asymptotic
behavior of the line complexity sequence $a_T(k)$, which counts, for each $k$,
the number of coefficient strings of length $k$ that occur in the automaton. We
begin with the modulo $2$ case. For a given polynomial $T(x) = c_0 + c_1x + ...
+ c_nx^n$ with $c_0,c_n\neq 0$, we construct odd and even parts of the
polynomial from the strings $0c_1c_3c_5...$ and $c_0c_2c_4...$, respectively.
We prove that for polynomials for which the odd and even parts are relatively
prime, $a_T(k)$ satisfies recursions of a specific form. We also consider
powers of transition rules modulo $p$, introducing a notion of the order of a
recursion. We show that the property of ""having a recursion of some order"" is
preserved when the transition rule is raised to a positive integer power.
Extending to a more general setting, we investigate the asymptotics of $a_T(k)$
by considering an abstract generating function
$\phi(z)=\sum_{k=1}^\infty\alpha(k)z^k$ which satisfies a general functional
equation relating $\phi(z)$ and $\phi(z^p)$ for some prime $p$. We show that
there is a continuous, piecewise quadratic function $f$ on $[1/p, 1]$ for which
$\lim_{k\to\infty}(\alpha(k)/k^2 - f(p^{-\langle\log_p k\rangle})) = 0$, where
$\langle y\rangle$ denotes the fractional part of $y$. We use this result to
show that for certain positive integer sequences $s_k\to\infty$ with a
parameter $x\in [1/p,1]$, the ratio $\alpha(s_k(x))/s_k(x)^2$ tends to $f(x)$,
and that the limit superior and inferior of $\alpha(k)/k^2$ are given by the
extremal values of $f$.

through the $c$ quark decay process: $c(ud) \to (s + u + \bar d)(ud)$, while
the hadronization part takes place in two different mechanisms. In the first
mechanism, the $sud$ cluster picks up a $q\bar{q}$ pair from the vacuum to form
the $\eta\Lambda$ meson-baryon pair while the $u\bar{d}$ pair from the weak
decay hadronizes into a $\pi^+$. In the second, the $sud$ cluster turns into a
$\Lambda$, while the $u\bar{d}$ pair from the $c$ decay picks up a $q\bar{q}$
pair and hadronizes into a meson-meson pair ($\pi\eta$ or $K\bar{K}$). Because
the final $\pi^+ \eta$ and $\eta \Lambda$ states are in pure isospin $I = 1$
and $I=0$ combinations, the $\Lambda^+_c \to \pi^+ \eta \Lambda$ decay can be
an ideal process to study the $a_0(980)$ and $\Lambda(1670)$ resonances.
Describing the final state interaction in the chiral unitary approach, we find
that the $\pi^+ \eta$ and $\eta \Lambda$ invariant mass distributions, up to an
arbitrary normalization, show clear cusp and peak structures, which can be
associated with the $a_0(980)$ and $\Lambda(1670)$ resonances, respectively.
The proposed mechanism can provide valuable information on the nature of these
resonances and can in principle be test by facilities such as BEPCII.

tractable (or safe), and connected them to tractable lineages. In our previous
work, using different tools, we showed that query evaluation is linear-time on
probabilistic databases for arbitrary monadic second-order queries, if we bound
the treewidth of the instance.
  In this paper, we study limitations and extensions of this result. First, for
probabilistic query evaluation, we show that MSO tractability cannot extend
beyond bounded treewidth: there are even FO queries that are hard on any
efficiently constructible unbounded-treewidth class of graphs. This dichotomy
relies on recent polynomial bounds on the extraction of planar graphs as
minors, and implies lower bounds in non-probabilistic settings, for query
evaluation and match counting in subinstance-closed families. Second, we show
how to explain our tractability result in terms of lineage: the lineage of MSO
queries on bounded-treewidth instances can be represented as bounded-treewidth
circuits, polynomial-size OBDDs, and linear-size d-DNNFs. By contrast, we can
strengthen the previous dichotomy to lineages, and show that there are even
UCQs with disequalities that have superpolynomial OBDDs on all
unbounded-treewidth graph classes; we give a characterization of such queries.
Last, we show how bounded-treewidth tractability explains the tractability of
the inversion-free safe queries: we can rewrite their input instances to have
bounded-treewidth.

in a fixed pressure ensemble. These counter-intuitive behaviors may be
understood from the characteristic spectrum of soft modes near isostaticity,

which of them would exhibit classical (local-realistic) behavior in the

Topos governed by a many-valued {\L}ukasiewicz logic. Sentences are integrated
in a symbolic knowledge base describing the problem domain, codified using a
graphic-based language, wherein every logic connective is defined by a neuron

rule extraction from trained networks. For the train of such neural networks we
changed the Levenderg-Marquardt algorithm, restricting the knowledge

effective and convenient way of finding information. However, a Web search can
be a threat to the privacy of the searcher because the queries may reveal
sensitive information about the searcher. Private Web search (PWS) solutions
allow users to find information on the Internet while preserving their privacy.
Here, privacy means maintaining the confidentiality of the identity of the
communicating users. According to their underlying technology, existing PWS
solutions can be divided into three types: proxy-based solutions,
obfuscation-based solutions, and cryptography-based solutions. Of these,
cryptography-based PWS (CB-PWS) systems are particularly interesting because
they provide strong privacy guarantees in the cryptographic sense. In this
paper, we present a round-efficient CB-PWS protocol that preserves
computational efficiency compared to other known CB-PWS systems. Assuming a
broadcast channel, our protocol is a \emph{four-round} cryptographic scheme
that requires $O(n)$ communication complexity. However, if only point-to-point
interaction is available, with the users emulating the broadcast channel, our
protocol requires an expected $O(1)$-round complexity and the same computation
and communication overhead. Further analyzing the efficiency of our protocol
shows that our proposal requires only $3n$ modular exponentiations for $n$
users. To evaluate the security of our protocol, we demonstrate that our
construction is secure in terms of a semi-honest model. We then discuss how to
enhance its security to render it secure in the presence of malicious
adversaries. We provide a specific protocol for managing users' groups, which
is also an advantage over existing systems.

k-partite intersecting hypergraphs have transversals of at most k-1 vertices.
An equivalent form was formulated by Gy\'arf\'as: if the edges of a complete
graph K are colored with k colors then the vertex set of K can be covered by at
most k-1 sets, each connected in some color. It turned out that the analogue of
the conjecture for hypergraphs can be answered: Z. Kir\'aly proved that in
every k-coloring of the edges of the r-uniform complete hypergraph K^r (r >=
3), the vertex set of K^r can be covered by at most $\lceil k/r \rceil$ sets,
each connected in some color.
  Here we investigate the analogue problem for complete r-uniform r-partite
hypergraphs. An edge coloring of a hypergraph is called spanning if every
vertex is incident to edges of any color used in the coloring. We propose the
following analogue of Ryser conjecture.
  In every spanning (r+t)-coloring of the edges of a complete r-uniform
r-partite hypergraph, the vertex set can be covered by at most t+1 sets, each
connected in some color.
  Our main result is that the conjecture is true for 1 <= t <= r-1. We also
prove a slightly weaker result for t >= r, namely that t+2 sets, each connected
in some color, are enough to cover the vertex set.
  To build a bridge between complete r-uniform and complete r-uniform r-partite
hypergraphs, we introduce a new notion. A hypergraph is complete r-uniform
(r,l)-partite if it has all r-sets that intersect each partite class in at most
l vertices.
  Extending our results achieved for l=1, we prove that for any r >= 3, 2 <= l
<= r, k >= 1+r-l, in every spanning k-coloring of the edges of a complete
r-uniform (r,l)-partite hypergraph, the vertex set can be covered by at most
1+\lfloor \frac{k-r+\ell-1}{\ell}\rfloor sets, each connected in some color.

outflows, in particular in cosmological gamma-ray bursts. The shocks produce
neutrino emission and affect the observed photospheric radiation from the
explosion. They develop from internal compressive waves and can be of different
types depending on the composition of the outflow: (1) Shocks in ""photon gas,""
with negligible plasma inertia, have a unique structure determined by the
force-free condition---zero radiation flux in the plasma rest frame. Radiation
dominance over plasma inertia suppresses formation of collisionless shocks
mediated by collective electromagnetic fields. (2) If the outflow is
sufficiently magnetized, a strong collisionless subshock develops, which is
embedded in a thicker radiation-mediated structure. (3) Waves in outflows with
a free neutron component lead to dissipation through nuclear collisions. At
large optical depths, shocks have a thickness comparable to the neutron free
path, with an embedded radiation-mediated and collisionless subshocks. The
paper also presents first-principle simulations of magnetized flows filled with
photons, demonstrating formation of shocks and their structure. Simple
estimates show that magnetized sub-photospheric shocks are efficient producers
of photons and have a great impact on the observed photospheric radiation. The
shock structure changes as the outflow expands toward its photosphere. The
dissipation is accompanied by strong $e^\pm$ pair creation, and the
$e^\pm$-dressed shock carries the photosphere with it up to two decades in
radius, emitting a strong pulse of nonthermal radiation.

evolutions up to 35 days after the $B$-band maximum provided an excellent match
with those of another SC SN 2009dc, providing a further support to the nature
of SN 2012dn as a SC SN. We found that SN 2012dn exhibited strong excesses in
the NIR wavelengths from $30$ days after the $B$-band maximum. The $H$ and
$K_{s}$-band light curves exhibited much later maximum dates at $40$ and $70$
days after the $B$-band maximum, respectively, compared with those of normal
SNe Ia. The $H$ and $K_{s}$-band light curves subtracted by those of SN 2009dc
displayed plateaued evolutions, indicating a NIR echo from the surrounding
dust. The distance to the inner boundary of the dust shell is limited to be
$4.8 - 6.4\times10^{-2}$ pc. No emission lines were found in its early phase
spectrum, suggesting that the ejecta-CSM interaction could not occur. On the
other hand, we found no signature that strongly supports the scenario of dust
formation. The mass loss rate of the pre-explosion system is estimated to be
$10^{-6}-10^{-5}$ M$_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$, assuming that the wind velocity of the

oscillation peak (BAO) in the Lyman $\alpha$ forest at $z\sim 2.34$ and the
best fit Planck $\Lambda$CDM cosmology. To isolate the origin of the tension,
we consider unanchored BAO, in which the standard BAO ruler is not calibrated,
eliminating any dependence on cosmology before redshift $z\sim 2.34$. We
consider BOSS BAO measurements at $z\sim 0.32$, 0.57 and 2.34, using the full
2-dimensional constraints on the angular and line of sight BAO scale, as well
as isotropic BAO measurements by 6dF and SDSS at $z\sim 0.106$ and $z\sim
0.15$. We find that the $z>0.43$ data alone is in 2.9 sigma of tension with
$\Lambda$CDM with or without the Planck best fit values of the mass fraction
$\Omega_m$ and the BAO scale $r_d H_0$, indicating that the tension arises not
from the $\Lambda$CDM parameters but from the dark energy evolution itself at
0.57<z<2.34. This conclusion is supported when the acoustic scale measured by
the CMB is included, which further increases the tension and excludes a
solution with a constant dark energy equation of state. Including the low $z$
BAO data, which is itself consistent with $\Lambda$CDM, reduces the tension to
just over 2 sigma, however in this case a CPL parametrization of the dark
energy evolution yields only a modest improvement.

optional regularizer. While there has been much work on different regularizers
many modern algorithms still use a data cost that is not very different from
the ones used over 30 years ago: a robust version of brightness constancy or
gradient constancy. In this paper we leverage the recent availability of
ground-truth optical flow databases in order to learn a data cost. Specifically
we take a generative approach in which the data cost models the distribution of
noise after warping an image according to the flow and we measure the
""goodness"" of a data cost by how well it matches the true distribution of flow
warp error. Consistent with current practice, we find that robust versions of
gradient constancy are better models than simple brightness constancy but a
learned GMM that models the density of patches of warp error gives a much
better fit than any existing assumption of constancy. This significant
advantage of the GMM is due to an explicit modeling of the spatial structure of
warp errors, a feature which is missing from almost all existing data costs in
optical flow. Finally, we show how a good density model of warp error patches
can be used for optical flow estimation on whole images. We replace the data
cost by the expected patch log-likelihood (EPLL), and show how this cost can be
optimized iteratively using an additional step of denoising the warp error
image. The results of our experiments are promising and show that patch models
with higher likelihood lead to better optical flow estimation.

could leave distinct electromagnetic signatures that reveal the energy
dissipation processes in the magnetar wind. In previous studies (Wang & Dai

lepton-dominated so that electrons/positrons in the magnetar wind are
accelerated by a diffusive shock. However, theoretical modeling of pulsar wind
nebulae shows that in many cases the magnetic field energy in the pulsar wind
may be strong enough to suppress diffusive shock acceleration. In this paper,
we investigate the reverse shock emission as well as the forward shock emission
with an arbitrary magnetization parameter $\sigma$ of a magnetar wind. We find
that the reverse shock emission strongly depends on $\sigma$, and in
particular, $\sigma \sim 0.3$ leads to the strongest reverse shock emission.

approach to the recognition of human actions from streaming data which meets
all these requirements by: (1) incrementally learning a model which adaptively

this work we systematically study the influence of the arrangement of the
phases by correlating the microstructure of a two-phase material to the onset
of ductile failure. A single topological feature is identified in which
critical levels of damage are consistently indicated. It consists of a small
region of the matrix phase with particles of the hard phase on both sides in a

large tensile hydrostatic stress and plastic strain is observed inside the

been recognized before for certain multi-phase materials. This study however
provides insight in the mechanics involved, including the influence of the
loading conditions and the arrangement of the phases in the material

the influence of volume fraction and hardness of the inclusion phase. For the

G-Hamiltonian structure in wave-number space, which directly determines the

eigenmodes with different Krein signatures. In terms of physics, this
rigorously implies that the system is destabilized when a positive-action mode
resonates with a negative-action mode, and that this is the only mechanism by
which the system can be destabilized. It is anticipated that this physical
mechanism of destabilization is valid for other collective instabilities in
conservative systems in plasma physics, accelerator physics, and fluid dynamics
systems, which admit infinite-dimensional Hamiltonian structures.

Minkowski squared norm provides a direct way of quantifying entanglement
through n-concurrence. However, the quantification of entanglement from DWF is
not straight forward. The DWF associated with a given quantum state is not
unique but depends on the way in which basis vectors are assigned to various

N+1 such possible assignments. While a given DWF corresponds to a unique Stokes

provides an elegant and direct method of constructing the DWFs from the Stokes

primordial DM haloes form preferentially through major mergers in radial

major mergers drive the central density slope to approach the {\it universal}

study both the initial fast exponential-like growth (the Cahn-Hilliard regime)
and the subsequent cross-over to a much slower, non-exponential long time
growth (the so-called scaling regime), by atomistic molecular dynamics (MD)
simulation of a structure breaking binary liquid mixture. In particular, we
combine our MD simulations with a coarse grained multi scale modelling (CGMSM)
capable of capturing both length and time scales of phase separation kinetics
within simulation box. The system is quenched from a higher temperature to two
lower temperatures well below the coexistence temperature of the phase diagram.
We observe a multiscale phase separation dynamics. Initially the growth is
exponential up to a regime of 80-100ps having strong dependence over quench
depth. Subsequently a cross-over regime appears where the dynamics slows down
considerably due to coarsening through a power law phase. For deeper quench
power law growth dominates over the initial exponential and the cross-over
becomes transient. We find that for the present parameter values for the binary
mixture, the initial rapid growth of structure formation is practically over
within 200 ps which is followed by slow structural coarsening. When scaled by
the respective viscosities, this time translates to 50-200 ns for
water-lutidine binary mixture. The last part of dynamics may extend into ms.
The dynamics of phase separation is slowest in regions that have equitable

giant branch stars in the Galactic globular cluster 47 Tuc, by comparing
synthetic modeling based on stellar evolution tracks with the observed
distribution of stars along the horizontal branch in the
colour-magnitude-diagram. We confirm that the observed, wedge-shaped
distribution of the horizontal branch can be reproduced only by accounting for
a range of initial He abundances --in agreement with inferences from the
analysis of the main sequence-- and a red giant branch mass loss with a small
dispersion. We have carefully investigated several possible sources of
uncertainty that could affect the results of the horizontal branch modeling,
stemming from uncertainties in both stellar model computations and the cluster
properties such as heavy element abundances, reddening and age. We determine a
firm lower limit of ~0.17$Mo for the mass lost by red giant branch stars,
corresponding to horizontal branch stellar masses between ~0.65Mo and ~0.73Mo
(the range driven by the range of initial helium abundances). We also derive
that in this cluster the amount of mass lost along the asymptotic giant branch
stars is comparable to the mass lost during the previous red giant branch
phase. These results confirm for this cluster the disagreement between
colour-magnitude-diagram analyses and inferences from recent studies of the
dynamics of the cluster stars, that predict a much less efficient red giant
branch mass loss. A comparison between the results from these two techniques
applied to other clusters is required, to gain more insights about the origin
of this disagreement.

we find that the transmission spectrum reveals multiple transmission dips,
whose properties we show how to characterize. In the many-photon regime the
system response can be highly non-linear, and under certain circumstances the
ensemble can behave like a single two-level system, which is only capable of
absorbing and emitting a single excitation at a time. Our results are of direct
relevance to atom-PCW experiments that should soon be realizable.

natural sciences to describe spatio-temporal processes. The parameters of the
considered processes are often unknown and have to be estimated from
experimental data. Due to partial observations and measurement noise, these
parameter estimates are subject to uncertainty. This uncertainty can be
assessed using profile likelihoods, a reliable but computationally intensive
approach. In this paper, we introduce an integration based approach for the
profile likelihood calculation for inverse problems with PDE constraints. While
existing approaches rely on repeated optimization, the proposed approach
exploits a dynamical system evolving along the likelihood profile. We derive
the dynamical system for the reduced and the full estimation problem and study
its properties. To evaluate the proposed method, we compare it with
state-of-the-art algorithms for a simple reaction-diffusion model for a
cellular patterning process. We observe a good accuracy of the method as well
as a significant speed up as compared to established methods. Integration based
profile calculation facilitates rigorous uncertainty analysis for
computationally demanding parameter estimation problems with PDE constraints.

Compact High Velocity Clouds. In this contribution we present the results of a
set of simulations aimed at the quantitative estimate of the sensitivity of the
survey as a function of the total luminosity, size and distance of the stellar
systems we are looking for. For all our synthetic galaxies we assumed an
exponential surface brightness profile and an old and metal-poor population.
The synthetic galaxies are simulated both on the images and on the photometric
catalogs, taking into account all the observational effects. In the fields
where the available observational material is of the top quality we detect
synthetic galaxies as >=5 sigma over-densities of resolved stars down to
muV,h=30.0 mag/arcsec2, for D<=1.5 Mpc, and down to muV,h~29.5 mag/arcsec2, for
D<=2.5 Mpc. In the field with the worst observational material of the whole
survey we detect synthetic galaxies with muV,h<=28.8 mag/arcsec2 out to D<=1.0
Mpc, and those with muV,h<=27.5 mag/arcsec2 out to D<=2.5 Mpc. Dwarf galaxies
with MV=-10, with sizes in the range spanned by known dwarfs, are detected by
visual inspection of the images up to D=5 Mpc independently of the image
quality. In the best quality images dwarfs are partially resolved into stars up
to D=3.0 Mpc, and completely unresolved at D=5 Mpc. As an independent test of
the sensitivity of our images to low surface brightness galaxies we report on
the detection of several dwarf spheroidal galaxies probably located in the
Virgo cluster with MV<=-8.0 and muV,h<=26.8 mag/arcsec2. The nature of the
previously discovered SECCO 1 stellar system, also likely located in the Virgo
cluster, is re-discussed in comparison with these dwarfs. While specific for
the SECCO survey, our study may also provide general guidelines for detection
of faint stellar systems with 8m class telescopes.

pairs. In this paper, the matting problem is reinterpreted as a sparse coding
of pixel features, wherein the sum of the codes gives the estimate of the alpha
matte from a set of unpaired F and B samples. A non-parametric probabilistic
segmentation provides a certainty measure on the pixel belonging to foreground
or background, based on which a dictionary is formed for use in sparse coding.
By removing the restriction to conform to (F,B) pairs, this method allows for
better alpha estimation from multiple F and B samples. The same framework is
extended to videos, where the requirement of temporal coherence is handled
effectively. Here, the dictionary is formed by samples from multiple frames. A
multi-frame graph model, as opposed to a single image as for image matting, is
proposed that can be solved efficiently in closed form. Quantitative and
qualitative evaluations on a benchmark dataset are provided to show that the
proposed method outperforms current state-of-the-art in image and video

Often the depth channel is captured at lower quality compared to the RGB
channels and different algorithms have been proposed to improve the quality of
the D channel given the RGB channels. Typically these approaches work by
assuming that edges in RGB are correlated with edges in D.
  In this paper we approach this problem from the standpoint of natural image
statistics. We obtain examples of high quality RGBD images from a computer
graphics generated movie (MPI-Sintel) and we use these examples to compare
different probabilistic generative models of RGBD image patches. We then use
the generative models together with a degradation model and obtain a Bayes

results show that learned generative models outperform the state-of-the-art in
improving the quality of depth channels given the color channels in natural

condition in the vicinity of the throat, due to the presence of higher order
curvature terms. Finally, we trace out a numerical analysis, by assuming a
specific redshift function, and find asymptotically flat solutions that satisfy
the weak energy condition throughout the spacetime.

upon the probabilistic framework of Gaussian processes (GPs). Specifically, we
introduce domain-specific GPs as local experts for facial expression

facilitated in probabilistic fashion by conditioning the target expert on
multiple source experts. Furthermore, in contrast to existing adaptation
approaches, we also learn a target expert from available target data solely.
Then, a single and confident classifier is obtained by combining the
predictions from multiple experts based on their confidence. Learning of the
model is efficient and requires no retraining/reweighting of the source
classifiers. We evaluate the proposed approach on two publicly available
datasets for multi-class (MultiPIE) and multi-label (DISFA) facial expression

'where' (view) and 'who' (subject). We show in our experiments that the

eukaryotes by post-transcriptional regulation channels that stabilise the
output layer, most notably protein levels. The discovery of small non-coding
RNAs (miRNAs) in specific motifs of the genetic regulatory network has led to
identifying noise buffering as the possible key function they exert in
regulation. Recent in vitro} and in silico studies have corroborated this
hypothesis. It is however also known that miRNA-mediated noise reduction is
hampered by transcriptional bursting in simple topologies. Here, using
stochastic simulations validated by analytical calculations based on van
Kampen's expansion, we revisit the noise-buffering capacity of the
miRNA-mediated Incoherent Feed Forward Loop (IFFL), a small module that is
widespread in the gene regulatory networks of higher eukaryotes, in order to
account for the effects of intermittency in the transcriptional activity of the
modulator gene. We show that bursting considerably alters the circuit's ability
to control static protein noise. By comparing with other regulatory
architectures, we find that direct transcriptional regulation significantly
outperforms the IFFL in a broad range of kinetic parameters. This suggests
that, under pulsatile inputs, static noise reduction may be less important than
dynamical aspects of noise and information processing in characterising the
performance of regulatory elements.

The donor electrons of the N donors substituting quasi-cubic ""k1"" and ""k2""

dependence of the T1^-1 for the donor electrons of N substituting hexagonal

we review the recent progress on kinetic simulations of this process and
further discuss plasma dynamics and particle acceleration in a low-$\beta$
reconnection layer that consists of electron-positron pairs. We also examine
the effect of different initial thermal temperatures on the resulting particle
energy spectra. While earlier papers have concluded that the spectral index is
smaller for higher $\sigma$, our simulations show that the spectral index
approaches $p=1$ for sufficiently low plasma $\beta$, even if $\sigma \sim 1$.
Since this predicted spectral index in the idealized limit is harder than most
observations, it is important to consider effects that can lead to a softer
spectrum such as open boundary simulations. We also remark that the effects of
3D reconnection physics and turbulence on reconnection need to be addressed in
the future.

(wires) are circular instead of linear. The left-to-right interpretation of a
quantum circuit is replaced by a circular representation which allows to select
the starting point and the direction in which gates are executed. The
representation supports all the circuits obtained after computing cyclic
permutations of an initial quantum gate list. Two circuits, where one has a
gate list which is a cyclic permutation of the other, will implement different
functions. The main question appears in the context of scalable quantum
computing, where multiple subcircuits are used for the construction of a larger
fault-tolerant one: can the same circular representation be used by multiple
subcircuits? The circular circuits are sufficient for constructing
computationally universal, fault-tolerant circuits formed entirely of qubit
initialisation, CNOT gates and qubit measurements. The main result of modelling
circular CNOT circuits is that a derived Boolean representation allows to
define a set of equations for $X$ and $Z$ stabiliser transformations. Through a
well defined set of steps it is possible to reduce the initial equations to a
set of stabiliser transformations given a series of cuts through the circular
circuit.

the extended narrow emission line regions powered by the quasars or by

average extended Ly$\alpha$ surface brightness profile around $z\sim2$ quasars,
carefully PSF-subtracting the unresolved emission component and paying close
attention to sources of systematic error. Our analysis, which achieves an
unprecedented depth, reveals a surface brightness of SB$_{\rm

problem using kernel methods, by relying particularly on a product of kernels

analyze this fusion approach in a discrete setting. More specifically, based on
a statistical model for the connectivity between data points, we propose an
algorithm for the selection of the kernel bandwidth, a parameter, which, as we
show, has important implications on the robustness of this fusion approach to
interferences. Then, we consider the fusion of audio-visual speech signals
measured by a single microphone and by a video camera pointed to the face of
the speaker. Specifically, we address the task of voice activity detection,
i.e., the detection of speech and non-speech segments, in the presence of
structured interferences such as keyboard taps and office noise. We propose an
algorithm for voice activity detection based on the audio-visual signal.
Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm outperforms competing
fusion and voice activity detection approaches. In addition, we demonstrate
that a proper selection of the kernel bandwidth indeed leads to improved
performance.

both in theoretical and practical computational problems. A key property of
these walks is that they converge rapidly to their stationary distribution.
  In this work we {\em define high order random walks}: These are
generalizations of random walks on graphs to high dimensional simplicial
complexes, which are the high dimensional analogues of graphs. A simplicial
complex of dimension $d$ has vertices, edges, triangles, pyramids, up to
$d$-dimensional cells. For any $0 \leq i < d$, a high order random walk on
dimension $i$ moves between neighboring $i$-faces (e.g., edges) of the complex,
where two $i$-faces are considered neighbors if they share a common
$(i+1)$-face (e.g., a triangle). The case of $i=0$ recovers the well studied
random walk on graphs.
  We provide a {\em local-to-global criterion} on a complex which implies {\em
rapid convergence of all high order random walks} on it. Specifically, we prove
that if the $1$-dimensional skeletons of all the links of a complex are
spectral expanders, then for {\em all} $0 \le i < d$ the high order random walk
on dimension $i$ converges rapidly to its stationary distribution.
  We derive our result through a new notion of high dimensional combinatorial
expansion of complexes which we term {\em colorful expansion}. This notion is a
natural generalization of combinatorial expansion of graphs and is strongly
related to the convergence rate of the high order random walks.
  We further show an explicit family of {\em bounded degree} complexes which
satisfy this criterion. Specifically, we show that Ramanujan complexes meet
this criterion, and thus form an explicit family of bounded degree high
dimensional simplicial complexes in which all of the high order random walks
converge rapidly to their stationary distribution.

exists a substantially high degeneracy among these reconstructed $f(R)$

constrained by using the SNe Ia+OHD+Planck+GW data-sets in the $f(R)-R$ plane,

implies that the effect of bulk viscosity plays a negligible role in the
V-$\omega$CDM model during the whole evolutionary processes of the universe. In
addition, one can also find that the reconstructed $f(R)$ theories using the

geometry, for downlink cellular networks with multiple-input-multiple-output
(MIMO) base stations (BSs). The developed paradigm accounts for signal
retransmission upon decoding errors, in which the temporal correlation among
the signal-to-interference plus-noise-ratio (SINR) of the original and
retransmitted signals is captured. In addition to modeling the effect of
retransmission on the network performance, the developed mathematical model
presents twofold analysis unification for MIMO cellular networks literature.
First, it integrates the tangible decoding error probability and the abstracted
(i.e., modulation scheme and receiver type agnostic) outage probability
analysis, which are largely disjoint in the literature. Second, it unifies the
analysis for different MIMO configurations. The unified MIMO analysis is
achieved by abstracting unnecessary information conveyed within the interfering
signals by Gaussian signaling approximation along with an equivalent SISO
representation for the per-data stream SINR in MIMO cellular networks. We show
that the proposed unification simplifies the analysis without sacrificing the
model accuracy. To this end, we discuss the diversity-multiplexing tradeoff
imposed by different MIMO schemes and shed light on the diversity loss due to
the temporal correlation among the SINRs of the original and retransmitted
signals. Finally, several design insights are highlighted.

through structurally dynamic junctions is, however, increasingly of interest

the steady-state current when relaxation of electrons in the reservoirs is

rotation, anticyclonic shear, and a stabilizing density gradient parallel to
the rotation axis. The primary instability of the laminar state leads not to
axisymmetric Taylor vortex flow but to the non-axisymmetric {\it
stratorotational instability} (SRI), so named by Shalybkov and R\""udiger
(2005). The present work extends the range of Reynolds numbers and buoyancy
frequencies ($N=\sqrt{(-g/\rho)(\partial \rho/\partial z)}$) examined in the
previous experiments by Boubnov and Hopfinger (1997) and Le Bars and Le Gal
(2007). Our observations reveal that the axial wavelength of the SRI
instability increases nearly linearly with Froude number, $Fr= \Omega_i/N$. For
small outer cylinder Reynolds number, the SRI occurs for inner inner Reynolds
number larger than for the axisymmetric Taylor vortex flow (i.e., the SRI is
more stable). For somewhat larger outer Reynolds numbers the SRI occurs for
smaller inner Reynolds numbers than Taylor vortex flow and even below the
Rayleigh stability line for an inviscid fluid. Shalybkov and R\""udiger (2005)
proposed that the laminar state of a stably stratified rotating shear flow
should be stable for $\Omega_o/ \Omega_i > r_i/r_o$, but we find that this

destabilizing effect of the density stratification diminishes as the Reynolds

well--known to depend on the spectrum of its replacement matrix: If its
dominant eigenvalue $r$ is simple and no other eigenvalue is `large' in the
sense that its real part is greater than $r/2$, the normalized urn composition
is asymptotically normally distributed. However, if there is more than one
large eigenvalue, the first few random draws have a non--negligible effect on
the evolution of the urn process and almost sure random tendencies of order
larger than $\sqrt{n}$ typically prevent a classical central limit theorem. In
the present work, a central limit theorem analogue for the fluctuations of urn
models with regard to random linear drift and random periodic growth of order
larger than $\sqrt{n}$ is proved, covering the $m$-ary search tree and B-trees.
The proof builds on an eigenspace decomposition of the process in order to
separate components of different growth orders. By an accurately tailored
adaption of martingale techniques to the components, their joint limiting
behaviour is established and translated back to the urn process. Conveniently,
the approach encompasses results on small urn models and therefore provides a
unifying perspective on central limit theorems for certain urn models,
irrespective of their spectrum.

an accretion rate > \dot M_stable, a first hydrogen shell flash occurs followed
by steady nuclear burning, so the shell burning will not be quenched as long as
the WD continuously accretes matter. On the basis of this picture, some
persistent supersoft X-ray sources can be explained by binary models with high
accretion rates. In some recent studies, however, the claim has been made that
no steady hydrogen shell burning exists even for accretion rates > \dot M_{\rm

because mass accretion was artificially controlled. If we stop mass accretion
during the outburst, no new nuclear fuel is supplied, so the shell burning will
eventually stop. If we resume mass accretion after some time, the next outburst
eventually occurs. In this way, we can design the duration of outburst and
interpulse time with manipulated mass accretion. We call such a controlled nova
a ""forced nova."" These forced novae, if they exist, could have much shorter

simplify the problem by introducing admission control on jobs. In the sequel,
optimal job assignment can be done straightforwardly and the problem is
transformed into improving job admission rate by scheduling on two coupled

tidal origin. Several high-resolution tracers (\halpha, UV, 8~\mi, and 24~\mi)

yielding a declining SFR in the recent past, consistent with the low \halpha/UV

distinct regions: one with moderate SF to the NE and one with only slightly
weaker CO emission but with nearly no SF. Even where SF is clearly present, the

magnetic nanoparticles. This is particularly important when the particles are
kept in a fluid suspension or packed inside nano-carriers. In addition to its
usual long-range nature, in these cases the dipolar interaction may also induce
the formation of clusters of particles, thereby strongly modifying their
magnetic anisotropies. In this paper we show how AC susceptibility may be used
to obtain important information regarding the influence of the dipolar
interaction in a sample. We develop a model which includes both aspects of the
dipolar interaction and may be fitted directly to the susceptibility data. The
usual long-range nature of the interaction is implemented using a mean-field
solution, whereas the particle-particle aggregation is modeled using a
distribution of anisotropy constants. The model is then applied to two samples
studied at different concentrations. One consists of spherical magnetite
nanoparticles dispersed in oil and the other of cubic magnetite nanoparticles
embedded on PLGA nanospheres. We also introduce a simple technique to access
the importance of the dipolar interaction in a given sample, based on the
height of the AC susceptibility peaks for different driving frequencies. Our
results help illustrate the important effect that the dipolar interaction has
in most nanoparticle samples.

suppose we put ourselves in the place someone 20 years in the future, a future
of autonomous systems. A future where transportation is largely autonomous,
more efficient, and far safer; a future where dangerous occupations like mining
or disaster response are performed by autonomous systems supervised remotely by
humans; a future where manufacturing and healthcare are twice as productive per
person-hour by having smart monitoring and readily re-tasked autonomous
physical agents; a future where the elderly and infirm have 24 hour in-home
autonomous support for the basic activities, both physical and social, of daily

someone come back to today's world where someone has to put their life at risk

information with advances in machine learning brings dramatic new capabilities
including the ability to capture and process tremendous amounts of data; to
predict behaviors, activities, and the future in uncanny ways; and to
manipulate the physical world in response. This trend will fundamentally change
how people interact with physical objects and the environment. Success in

band dispersion (i.e., $N=2$, $E\sim k^2$), the long-wavelength plasma

experience damping below a critical density. For systems with the anisotropic
dispersion the density dependence of the long-wavelength plasma frequency along

behaves like that of the isotropic non-linear model ($N \ge 2$). Plasmons along

whose contribution in the 4D effective field theory remains invariant under the
modular transformation and study inflation drived by $T$. The modular
invariance restricts a possible form of the scalar potenntial. As a result,
large field models of inflation are hardly realized. Meanwhile, a small field
model of inflation can be still accomodated in this restricted setup. The
scalar potential traced during the slow-roll inflation mimics the hilltop
potential $V_{ht}$, but it also has a non-negligible deviation from $V_{ht}$.

magnetic anisotropy using a time-resolved magneto-optical Kerr effect
magnetometer. The competition between the out-of-plane anisotropy of the hard
layer, the in-plane anisotropy of the soft layer and the applied bias field
reorganizes the spins in the soft layer, which are modified further with the
variation in t. The spin-wave spectrum, the ultrafast demagnetization time, and
the extracted damping coefficient all depend on the spin distribution in the
soft layer, while the latter two also depend on the spin-orbit coupling between
the Co and Pd layers. The spin-wave spectra change from multimode to
single-mode as t increases. At the maximum field reached in this study, H=2.5

critical to understanding this behavior. Domains in Co/Ni multi-layers are
observed to preferentially grow into non-elliptical teardrop shapes, which vary
with the magnitude of an applied in-plane field. We model the domain profile
using energetic calculations of equilibrium shape via the Wulff construction,

  Randomized Function Computation",,,,,"cs.CR cs.DB","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  How to achieve differential privacy in the distributed setting, where the
dataset is distributed among the distrustful parties, is an important problem.
We consider in what condition can a protocol inherit the differential privacy
property of a function it computes. The heart of the problem is the secure
multiparty computation of randomized function. A notion \emph{obliviousness} is
introduced, which captures the key security problems when computing a
randomized function from a deterministic one in the distributed setting. By
this observation, a sufficient and necessary condition about computing a
randomized function from a deterministic one is given. The above result can not
only be used to determine whether a protocol computing differentially private
function is secure, but also be used to construct secure one. Then we prove
that the differential privacy property of a function can be inherited by the
protocol computing it if the protocol privately computes it. A composition
theorem of differentially private protocols is also presented. We also
construct some protocols to generate random variate in the distributed setting,
such as the uniform random variates and the inversion method. By using these
fundamental protocols, we construct protocols of the Gaussian mechanism, the
Laplace mechanism and the Exponential mechanism. Importantly, all these
protocols satisfy obliviousness and so can be proved to be secure in a
simulation based manner. We also provide a complexity bound of computing
randomized function in the distribute setting. Finally, to show that our
results are fundamental and powerful to multiparty differential privacy, we
construct a differentially private empirical risk minimization protocol.

relationships between a set of species $X$; these relationships are often
depicted via a phylogenetic tree -- a tree having its leaves univocally labeled
by elements of $X$ and without degree-2 nodes -- called the ""species tree"". One
common approach for reconstructing a species tree consists in first
constructing several phylogenetic trees from primary data (e.g. DNA sequences
originating from some species in $X$), and then constructing a single
phylogenetic tree maximizing the ""concordance"" with the input trees. The
so-obtained tree is our estimation of the species tree and, when the input
trees are defined on overlapping -- but not identical -- sets of labels, is
called ""supertree"". In this paper, we focus on two problems that are central
when combining phylogenetic trees into a supertree: the compatibility and the
strict compatibility problems for unrooted phylogenetic trees. These problems
are strongly related, respectively, to the notions of ""containing as a minor""
and ""containing as a topological minor"" in the graph community. Both problems
are known to be fixed-parameter tractable in the number of input trees $k$, by
using their expressibility in Monadic Second Order Logic and a reduction to
graphs of bounded treewidth. Motivated by the fact that the dependency on $k$
of these algorithms is prohibitively large, we give the first explicit dynamic
programming algorithms for solving these problems, both running in time
$2^{O(k^2)} \cdot n$, where $n$ is the total size of the input.

weighted observations in a stream of data when the observer has limited buffer
capacity. A stream of weighted items arrive one at a time at the entrance of a
buffer with two holding locations. A processor (or observer) can process
(observe) an item at the buffer location it chooses, deriving this way the
weight of the observed item as profit. The main constraint is that the
processor can only move {\em synchronously} with the item stream; as a result,
moving from the end of the buffer to the entrance, it crosses paths with the
item already there, and will never have the chance to process or even identify
it. \textsc{Persistence}\ is the online problem of scheduling the processor
movements through the buffer so that its total derived value is maximized under
this constraint.
  We study the performance of the straight-forward heuristic {\em Threshold},
i.e., forcing the processor to ""follow"" an item through the whole buffer only
if its value is above a threshold. We analyze both the optimal offline and
Threshold algorithms in case the input stream is a random permutation, or its
items are iid valued. We show that in both cases the competitive ratio achieved
by the Threshold algorithm is at least $2/3$ when the only statistical
knowledge of the items is the median of all possible values. We generalize our
results by showing that Threshold, equipped with some minimal statistical
advice about the input, achieves competitive ratios in the whole spectrum
between $2/3$ and $1$, following the variation of a newly defined density-like

to solve this problem usually learns one single predictor for all the data

propose to learn different local predictors for neighborhoods of different data

of each data point, we proposed to learn a linear predictor by minimizing both
the complexity of the predictor and the upper bound of the structured

correlation between solar surface indices and the changes in the relative
portion of the small and large SGs. This somewhat unexpected finding suggest
that plage regions decreased in a lower values in spite of the higher number of
large SGs in SAC 23 while Ca II K-flux did not decrease by large amount or it
was comparable with SAC 22 for some years and relates with C type and DEF type

  Sparse MANET Networks, using NS2 and the Evalvid Framework","International Journal of Computer Science and Information Security,
  published in Vol. 14 No. 3 MARCH 2016 International Journal of Computer
  Science and Information Security",,,,"cs.NI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Advances in multimedia and ad-hoc networking have urged a wealth of research
in multimedia delivery over ad-hoc networks. This comes as no surprise, as
those networks are versatile and beneficial to a plethora of applications where
the use of fully wired network has proved intricate if not impossible, such as
prompt formation of networks during conferences, disaster relief in case of
flood and earthquake, and also in war activities. It this paper, we aim to
investigate the combined impact of network sparsity and network node density on
the Peak Signal Noise to Ratio (PSNR) and jitter performance of proactive and
reactive routing protocols in ad-hoc networks. We also shed light onto the
combined effect of mobility and sparsity on the performance of these protocols.
We validate our results through the use of an integrated Simulator-Evaluator
environment consisting of the Network Simulator NS2, and the Video Evaluation
Framework Evalvid.

utilizing scarce and streaming data. A discrete embedding space is first built
using hash functions applied to the sensor measurements from which a Markov
process model is derived, approximating the complex system's dynamics. A
control strategy is then learned using reinforcement learning once rewards
relevant with respect to the control objective are identified. This method is
designed for experimental configurations, requiring no computations nor prior
knowledge of the system, and enjoys intrinsic robustness. It is illustrated on
two systems: the control of the transitions of a Lorenz 63 dynamical system,
and the control of the drag of a cylinder flow. The method is shown to perform
well.

of transferring results from semigroup theory. This applies to analogous

to transfer the general theory from universal algebra. Special attention is

ratios $K/{\pi}$, $K/p$, and $p/{\pi}$ are calculated from the hadron resonance
gas (HRG) model and compared with STAR central Au+Au collisions at
$\sqrt{s_{NN}}=7.7-200~$GeV and NA49 central Pb+Pb collisions at
$\sqrt{s_{NN}}=6.3-17.3~$GeV. The three charged-particle ratios ($K/{\pi}$,
$K/p$, and $p/{\pi}$) are determined as total and average of opposite and
average of same charges. We find an excellent agreement between the HRG
calculations and the experimental measurements, especially from STAR beam
energy scan (BES) program, while the strange particles in the NA49 experiment
at lower Super Proton Synchrotron (SPS) energies are not reproduced by the HRG
approach. We conclude that the utilized HRG version seems to take into
consideration various types of correlations including strong interactions
through the heavy resonances and their decays especially at BES energies.

normal currency. As the human race expands and we colonize other planets, we
have to consider how we are going to extend integral parts of of society, and
that includes our currency system. Information transferring does not scale well
with very large distances, entirely due to physical limitations. For example,
there is a maximum speed that any information can travel, and it cannot be
faster than the speed of light. In this paper we take these physical
limitations into account to give treatment to the following question. Can a
single crypto-currency be used across the entire universe? Trivially many
currencies can be used with exchange rates but we will try to avoid this as our
solution. The idea of this paper was inspired by a paper titled ""The Theory of
Interstellar Trade"" by Paul Krugman, a Nobel Economist.

variety of design assumptions is continuously matched with the truth of the

of these assumptions, in practice most of them end up being either sifted off
or hidden between the lines of our codes. Across the system layers, a complex
and at times obscure web of assumptions determines the quality of the match of
our software with its deployment platforms and run-time environments. Our
position is that it becomes increasingly important being able to design
software systems with architectural and structuring techniques that allow
software to be decomposed to reduce its complexity, but without hiding in the
process vital hypotheses and assumptions. In this paper we discuss this
problem, introduce three potentially dangerous consequences of its denial, and
propose three strategies to facilitate their treatment. Finally we propose our
vision towards a new holistic approach to software development to overcome the
shortcomings offered by fragmented views to the problem of assumption failures.
