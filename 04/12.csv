56 flares are found to have pronounced QPP-like signatures in the light curve,

the QPP period and the stellar temperature, radius, rotation period and surface
gravity, suggesting that the QPPs are independent of global stellar parameters.
Hence they are likely to be the result of processes occurring in the local
environment. There is also no significant correlation between the QPP period
and flare energy, however there is evidence that the period scales with the QPP
decay time for the Gaussian damping scenario, but not to a significant degree
for the exponentially damped case. This same scaling has been observed for MHD
oscillations on the Sun, suggesting that they could be the cause of the QPPs in
those flares. Scaling laws of the flare energy are also investigated,
supporting previous reports of a strong correlation between the flare energy

exactly one role specified in the type of the session. We refer to this kind of

a group session (g-session) is one in which each party may implement a group of

a dyadic g-session implements either a group of roles or its complement. In
this paper, we present a formalization of g-sessions in a multi-threaded
lambda-calculus (MTLC) equipped with a linear type system, establishing for the
MTLC both type preservation and global progress. As this formulated MTLC can be
readily embedded into ATS, a full-fledged language with a functional
programming core that supports both dependent types (of DML-style) and linear
types, we obtain a direct implementation of linearly typed g-sessions in ATS.
The primary contribution of the paper lies in both of the identification of
g-sessions as a fundamental building block for multiparty sessions and the
theoretical development in support of this identification.

cell-probe lower bounds on dynamic data structure problems. We introduce a new
randomized nondeterministic four-party communication model that enables
""accelerated"", error-preserving simulations of dynamic data structures.
  We use this technique to prove an $\Omega(n(\log n/\log\log n)^2)$ cell-probe
lower bound for the dynamic 2D weighted orthogonal range counting problem
(2D-ORC) with $n/\mathrm{poly}\log n$ updates and $n$ queries, that holds even
for data structures with $\exp(-\tilde{\Omega}(n))$ success probability. This
result not only proves the highest amortized lower bound to date, but is also
tight in the strongest possible sense, as a matching upper bound can be
obtained by a deterministic data structure with worst-case operational time.
This is the first demonstration of a ""sharp threshold"" phenomenon for dynamic
data structures.
  Our broader motivation is that cell-probe lower bounds for exponentially
small success facilitate reductions from dynamic to static data structures. As
a proof-of-concept, we show that a slightly strengthened version of our lower
bound would imply an $\Omega((\log n /\log\log n)^2)$ lower bound for the
static 3D-ORC problem with $O(n\log^{O(1)}n)$ space. Such result would give a
near quadratic improvement over the highest known static cell-probe lower
bound, and break the long standing $\Omega(\log n)$ barrier for static data
structures.

that the metallicities, the temperatures and the surface gravities for barium
stars can not be represented by a single gaussian distribution. The abundances
of $alpha$-elements and iron peak elements are similar to those of field giants
with the same metallicity. Sodium presents some degree of enrichment in more
evolved stars that could be attributed to the NeNa cycle. As expected, the
barium stars show overabundance of the elements created by the s-process. By
measuring the mean heavy-element abundance pattern as given by the ratio
[s/Fe], we found that the barium stars present several degrees of enrichment.
We also obtained the [hs/ls] ratio by measuring the photospheric abundances of
the Ba-peak and the Zr-peak elements. Our results indicated that the [s/Fe] and
the [hs/ls] ratios are strongly anti-correlated with the metallicity. Our
kinematical analysis showed that 90% of the barium stars belong to the thin
disk population. Based on their luminosities, none of the barium stars are
luminous enough to be an AGB star, nor to become self-enriched in the s-process
elements. Finally, we determined that the barium stars also follow an
age-metallicity relation.

flavor mixing, which may be derived from a class of neutrino mass models with

$\theta^{}_{12} \approx \theta^{\nu}_{12} + \theta^{}_{13} \cos \delta$, where
$\theta^\nu_{12}$ stems from a constant mixing pattern in the neutrino sector
and takes the value of $\theta^\nu_{12} = 45^\circ$ for the bi-maximal mixing
(BM), $\theta^\nu_{12} = \tan^{-1}(1/\sqrt{2}) \approx 35.3^\circ$ for the
tri-bimaximal mixing (TBM) or $\theta^\nu_{12} = \tan^{-1}\left[2/(\sqrt{5} +

the renormalization-group (RG) running effects on lepton flavor mixing
parameters when this sum rule is assumed at a superhigh-energy scale. For
illustration, we work within the framework of the minimal supersymmetric
standard model (MSSM), and implement the Bayesian approach to explore the
posterior distribution of $\delta$ at the low-energy scale, which becomes quite
broad when the RG running effects are significant. Moreover, we also discuss
the compatibility of the above three mixing scenarios with current neutrino
oscillation data, and observe that radiative corrections can increase such a

frequently associated to the transient coexistence of two phases of particles,

identified empirically, which makes difficult investigating their relation with
the structural properties of the system. Here we show that the distribution of

acquires a transient bimodal shape in the deeply supercooled regime, thus
allowing for a clear identification of the two coexisting phase. In a simple
two-dimensional glass forming model, the dynamic phase coexistence is
accompanied by a striking structural counterpart: the distribution of the
crystalline-like order parameter becomes also bimodal on cooling, with
increasing overlap between ordered and immobile particles. This simple
structural signature is absent in other models, such as the three-dimesional
Kob-Andersen Lennard-Jones mixture, where more sophisticated order parameters

frustrate the appearance of magnetism. In two dimensions, the classic example
is the kagome lattice composed of corner sharing triangles. There are a variety
of minerals whose transition metal ions form such a lattice. Hence, a number of
them have been studied, and were then subsequently synthesized in order to

help us understand the dynamics that drive neural computation. However, due to
the biophysical constraints and noise in the spike trains, inferring
trajectories from data is a challenging statistical problem in general. Here,
we propose a practical and efficient inference method, called the variational
latent Gaussian process (vLGP). The vLGP combines a generative model with a
history-dependent point process observation together with a smoothness prior on
the latent trajectories. The vLGP improves upon earlier methods for recovering
latent trajectories, which assume either observation models inappropriate for
point processes or linear dynamics. We compare and validate vLGP on both
simulated datasets and population recordings from the primary visual cortex. In
the V1 dataset, we find that vLGP achieves substantially higher performance
than previous methods for predicting omitted spike trains, as well as capturing
both the toroidal topology of visual stimuli space, and the noise-correlation.
These results show that vLGP is a robust method with a potential to reveal

useful probes of optical depth, via the relative line strengths of their
hyperfine components.The hyperfine splitting is particularly advantageous in
interpreting the physical conditions of the emitting gas because with a second
rotational transition, both gas density and temperature can be derived. For HCN
however, the relative strengths of the hyperfine lines are anomalous. They
appear in ratios which can vary significantly from source to source, and are
inconsistent with local thermodynamic equilibrium. This is the HCN hyperfine
anomaly, and it prevents the use of simple LTE models of HCN emission to derive
reliable optical depths. In this paper we demonstrate how to model HCN
hyperfine line emission, and derive accurate line ratios, spectral line shapes
and optical depths. We show that by carrying out radiative transfer
calculations over each hyperfine level individually, as opposed to summing them
over each rotational level, the anomalous hyperfine emission emerges naturally.
To do this requires not only accurate radiative rates between hyperfine states,
but also accurate collisional rates. We investigate the effects of different
sets of hyperfine collisional rates, derived via the 'proportional method' and
through direct recoupling calculations. Through an extensive parameter sweep
over typical low mass star forming conditions, we show the HCN line ratios to
be highly variable to optical depth. We also reproduce an observed effect
whereby the red-blue asymmetry of the hyperfine lines (an infall signature)
switches sense within a single rotational transition.

the design of digital systems that are resilient to reliability failures:
achieve desired resilience targets at minimal costs (energy, power, execution
time, area) by combining resilience techniques across various layers of the
system stack (circuit, logic, architecture, software, algorithm). This is also
referred to as cross-layer resilience. In this paper, we focus on
radiation-induced soft errors in processor cores. We address both single-event
upsets (SEUs) and single-event multiple upsets (SEMUs) in terrestrial
environments. Our framework automatically and systematically explores the large
space of comprehensive resilience techniques and their combinations across
various layers of the system stack (586 cross-layer combinations in this
paper), derives cost-effective solutions that achieve resilience targets at
minimal costs, and provides guidelines for the design of new resilience
techniques. We demonstrate the practicality and effectiveness of our framework
using two diverse designs: a simple, in-order processor core and a complex,
out-of-order processor core. Our results demonstrate that a carefully optimized
combination of circuit-level hardening, logic-level parity checking, and
micro-architectural recovery provides a highly cost-effective soft error
resilience solution for general-purpose processor cores. For example, a 50x
improvement in silent data corruption rate is achieved at only 2.1% energy cost
for an out-of-order core (6.1% for an in-order core) with no speed impact.
However, selective circuit-level hardening alone, guided by a thorough analysis
of the effects of soft errors on application benchmarks, provides a
cost-effective soft error resilience solution as well (with ~1% additional
energy cost for a 50x improvement in silent data corruption rate).

identification of neurons and determination of synapses between neurons. As
manual extraction of this information is very time-consuming, there has been
extensive research effort to automatically segment the neurons to help guide
and eventually replace manual tracing. Until recently, there has been
comparatively less research on automatically detecting the actual synapses
between neurons. This discrepancy can, in part, be attributed to several
factors: obtaining neuronal shapes is a prerequisite first step in extracting a
connectome, manual tracing is much more time-consuming than annotating
synapses, and neuronal contact area can be used as a proxy for synapses in
determining connections.
  However, recent research has demonstrated that contact area alone is not a
sufficient predictor of synaptic connection. Moreover, as segmentation has
improved, we have observed that synapse annotation is consuming a more
significant fraction of overall reconstruction time. This ratio will only get
worse as segmentation improves, gating overall possible speed-up. Therefore, we
address this problem by developing algorithms that automatically detect
pre-synaptic neurons and their post-synaptic partners. In particular,
pre-synaptic structures are detected using a Deep and Wide Multiscale Recursive
Network, and post-synaptic partners are detected using a MLP with features
conditioned on the local segmentation.
  This work is novel because it requires minimal amount of training, leverages
advances in image segmentation directly, and provides a complete solution for
polyadic synapse detection. We further introduce novel metrics to evaluate our
algorithm on connectomes of meaningful size. These metrics demonstrate that
complete automatic prediction can be used to effectively characterize most
connectivity correctly.

under debate. The classical scenario where both the Large and Small Magellanic
Clouds (LMC, SMC) are orbiting the Milky Way has been challenged by an
alternative where the LMC and SMC are in their first close passage to our
Galaxy. Detailed studies of stellar populations in the galaxies should
constrain the proposed scenarios. In particular, the west halo of the SMC was
recently characterized with radial trends in age and metallicity which
indicates tidal disruption. We increase the sample of star clusters in the west
halo of the SMC with homogeneous age, metallicity, and distance derivations, to
determine better age and metallicity gradients. Comparisons of observed and
synthetic V,(B-V) colour-magnitude diagrams are used to derive parameters for
west halo star clusters. We derived age and metallicity for the reference
cluster NGC 152 compatible with literature parameters. Age and metallicity
gradients are confirmed in the west halo: 2.6 +/- 0.6 Gyr/deg and -0.19 +/-
0.09 dex/deg, respectively. Age-metallicity relation for the west halo has low
dispersion in metallicity and it is compatible with a burst model of chemical
enrichment. All WH clusters seem to follow the same predicted stellar
distribution, with exception of AM-3 that should belong to the counter-bridge.
Bruck 6 is only 130 +/- 40 Myr old and it could have been formed during a
recent tidal interaction of the SMC-LMC. We suggest that it is crucial to split
the SMC cluster population in groups: main body, wing/bridge, counter-bridge
and west halo. This is the way to analyse the complex star formation and
dynamical history of our neighbour. In particular we show that west halo has
clear age and metallicity gradients and age-metallicity relation, also
compatible with the dynamical model of tidal influence of the LMC over the SMC.

dynamics. Examples are supercooled liquids, whose dynamics slow down under
cooling. The specific pattern of slowing-down depends on the material
considered. This dependence is poorly understood, in particular, it remains
generally unclear which aspects of the microscopic structures control the
dynamics and other macroscopic properties. Attacking this question is one of
the two main aspects of this dissertation. We have introduced a new class of
models of supercooled liquids, which captures the central aspects of the
correspondence between structure and elasticity on the one hand, the
correlation of structure and thermodynamic and dynamic properties on the other.
Our results shed new light on the temperature-dependence of the topology of
covalent networks, in particular, on the rigidity transition that occurs when
the valence is increased.
  Other questions appear in glassy systems at zero temperature. In that
situation, a glassy system can flow if an external driving force is imposed
above some threshold. The first example we will consider is the erosion of a
riverbed. Experiments support the existence of a threshold forcing, below which
no erosion flux is observed. In this dissertation, we present a novel
microscopic model to describe the erosion near threshold. This model makes new
quantitative predictions for the spatial reparation of the flux. To study
further the self-organization of driven glassy systems, we investigate the
athermal dynamics of mean-field spin glasses. The spin glass self-organizes
into the configurations that are stable, but barely so. Such marginal stability
appears with the presence of a pseudogap in soft excitations. We show that the
emergence of a pseudogap is deeply related to very strong anti-correlations
emerging among soft excitations.

construct and study measures of dissimilarity of probability distributions;
special cases include the relative entropy and the R\'enyi divergences. Various
quantum versions of this concept, and more narrowly, the concept of R\'enyi
divergences, have been introduced in the literature with applications in
quantum information theory; most notably Petz' quasi-entropies (standard
$f$-divergences), Matsumoto's maximal $f$-divergences, measured
$f$-divergences, and sandwiched and $\alpha$-$z$-R\'enyi divergences.
  In this paper we give a systematic overview of the various concepts of
quantum $f$-divergences with a main focus on their monotonicity under quantum
operations, and the implications of the preservation of a quantum
$f$-divergence by a quantum operation. In particular, we compare the standard
and the maximal $f$-divergences regarding their ability to detect the
reversibility of quantum operations. We also show that these two quantum
$f$-divergences are strictly different for non-commuting operators unless $f$
is a polynomial, and obtain some analogous partial results for the relation
between the measured and the standard $f$-divergences.
  We also study the monotonicity of the $\alpha$-$z$-R\'enyi divergences under
the special class of bistochastic maps that leave one of the arguments of the
R\'enyi divergence invariant, and determine domains of the parameters
$\alpha,z$ where monotonicity holds, and where the preservation of the
$\alpha$-$z$-R\'enyi divergence implies the reversibility of the quantum
operation.

appropriately chosen unitary operator in the boundary theory can create a
locally strong excitation near the black hole horizon, whose global energy is
small as a result of the gravitational redshift. The paradox is that this seems
to violate a general rule of statistical mechanics, which states that an
operator with energy parametrically smaller than $k T$ cannot create a
significant excitation in a thermal system. When we carefully examine the
position dependence of the boundary unitary operator that produces the
excitation and the bulk observable necessary to detect the anomalously large
effect, we find that they do not both fit in a single causal patch. This
follows from a remarkable property of position space AdS correlators that we
establish explicitly, and resolves the paradox in a generic state of the
system, since no combination of observers can both create the excitation and
observe its effect. As a special case of our analysis, we show how this
resolves the ""Born rule"" paradox of arXiv:1506.01337 and we verify our solution
using an independent calculation. We then consider boundary states that are
finely tuned to display a spontaneous excitation outside the causal patch of
the infalling observer, and we propose a version of causal patch
complementarity in AdS/CFT that resolves the paradox for such states as well.

The SZ data links the maximum observable X-ray scale to the large Mpc scale,
extending our knowledge of the power spectrum of ICM fluctuations. Deprojecting
the 2-d SZ perturbations into 3-d pressure fluctuations, we find an amplitude
spectrum which peaks at $\delta P/P = 33\pm 12\%$ and $74\pm19\%$ in the $15'$
and $40'$ radius region, respectively. We perform tests to ensure fluctuations
are intrinsic to the cluster and not due to noise contamination. By using
high-resolution hydrodynamical models, we improve the ICM turbulence
constraints in Coma, finding 3-d Mach number ${\rm Ma_{3d}}= 0.8\pm0.3$ (15'
region), increasing to supersonic values at larger radii (40'), and an
injection scale $L_{\rm inj}\approx 500$ kpc. Such properties are consistent
with driving due to mergers, in particular tied to internal galaxy groups. The
large pressure fluctuations show that Coma is in adiabatic mode (mediated by
sound waves), rather than isobaric mode (mediated by buoyancy waves). As
predicted by turbulence models, the distribution of SZ fluctuations is
log-normal with mild non-Gaussianities (heavy tails). The substantial
non-thermal pressure support implies hydrostatic mass bias $b_M=-15\%$ to
$-45\%$ from the core to the outskirt region, respectively. While total SZ
power probes the thermal energy content, the SZ fluctuations constrain the
non-thermal deviations important for precision cosmology. The proposed, novel
approach can be exploited by multifrequency observations using ground based
interferometers and future space CMB missions.

still uncertain. It is widely believed that these planets formed near the
water-ice line of the protoplanetary disk, and subsequently migrated into much
smaller orbits. Most of the proposed migration mechanisms can be classified
either as disk-driven migration, or as excitation of a very high eccentricity
followed by tidal circularization. In the latter scenario, the giant planet
that is destined to become a hot Jupiter spends billions of years on a
highly-eccentric orbit, with apastron near the water-ice line. Eventually,
tidal dissipation at periastron shrinks and circularizes the orbit. If this is
correct, then it should be especially rare for hot Jupiters to be accompanied
by another giant planet interior to the water-ice line. Using the current
sample of giant planets discovered with the Doppler technique, we find that hot
Jupiters with P_orb < 10 days are no more or less likely to have exterior
Jupiter-mass companions than longer-period giant planets with P_orb >= 10 days.
This result holds for exterior companions both inside and outside of the
approximate location of the water-ice line. These results are difficult to
reconcile with the high-eccentricity migration scenario for hot Jupiter
formation.

skew scattering contribution to the spin Hall conductivity is shown to
quantitatively agree with Boltzmann transport theory over a wide range of
parameters. Our self-consistent approach---where all topologically equivalent
noncrossing diagrams are resummed---unveils that the skewness generated by
spin--orbit-active impurities deeply influences the anomalous component of the
spin Hall conductivity, even in the weak scattering regime. This seemingly
counterintuitive result is explained by the rich sublattice structure of
scattering potentials in graphene, for which traditional Gaussian disorder
approximations fail to capture the intricate correlations between skew
scattering and side jumps generated through diffusion. Finally, we assess the
role of quantum interference corrections by evaluating an important subclass of
crossing diagrams recently considered in the context of the anomalous Hall

order congruence lattices of finite posets, and a weighted generalization of
the k-equal partition lattices.
  We also exhibit many examples of (co)modernistic lattices that were already

weakening of the definitions of semimodular and supersolvable. We thus obtain a
unified proof that lattice in these classes are shellable.
  Subgroup lattices of solvable groups form another family of comodernistic
lattices that were already proved to be shellable. We show not only that
subgroup lattices of solvable groups are comodernistic, but that solvability of

Indeed, the definition of comodernistic exactly requires on every interval a

thatspicules display a rich and detailed spatial structure, and show a
distribution of transverse velocities that when aligned with the line of sight
can make them appear at different H-alpha wing positions. They become more
abundant at positions closer to the line core, reflecting a distribution of
Doppler shifts and widths. In H-alpha width maps they stand out as bright
features both on disk and off limb, reflecting their large Doppler motions and
possibly higher temperatures than in the typical H-alpha formation region.
Spicule lifetimes measured from narrowband images at only a few positions will
be an underestimate because Doppler shifts can make them disappear prematurely
from such images; for such cases, width maps are a more robust tool. In H-alpha
and Ca II H filtergrams, off limb spicules essentially have the same
properties, appearance, and evolution. We find that the sudden appearance of

as a key resource behind this computational speed-up. However there is a limit
to this interference, at most pairs of paths can ever interact in a fundamental
way. Could more interference imply more computational power? Sorkin has defined
a hierarchy of possible interference behaviours---currently under experimental
investigation---where classical theory is at the first level of the hierarchy
and quantum theory belongs to the second. Informally, the order in the
hierarchy corresponds to the number of paths that have an irreducible
interaction in a multi-slit experiment. In this work, we consider how Grover's
speed-up depends on the order of interference in a theory. Surprisingly, we
show that the quadratic lower bound holds regardless of the order of

behavior interior to $\approx 110 R_S$, which we attribute to either the moon
Iapetus sweeping up small particles, or to orbital instabilities that cause the

stable orbit, may distinguish between formation theories. In this work, we
determine how planet-planet scattering shapes planetary systems around binaries
as compared to single stars. In particular, we look for signatures that arise
due to differences in dynamical evolution in binary systems. We carry out a
parameter study of N-body scattering simulations for four distinct planet
populations around both binary and single stars. While binarity has little
influence on the final system multiplicity or orbital distribution, the
presence of a binary dramatically effects the means by which planets are lost
from the system. Most circumbinary planets are lost due to ejections rather
than planet-planet or planet-star collisions. The most massive planet in the
system tends to control the evolution. Systems similar to the only observed
multi-planet circumbinary system, Kepler-47, can arise from much more tightly
packed, unstable systems. Only extreme initial conditions introduce differences

our ideas with two complementary proposals for simulating lattice-regularized
quantum electrodynamics (QED) in (1+1) space-time dimensions. The first scheme
replaces the gauge fields by local vibrations with a high occupation number. By
numerical finite-size scaling, we demonstrate that this model recovers Wilson's
lattice gauge theory in a controlled way. Its implementation can be scaled up
to tens of ions in an array of micro-traps. The second scheme represents the
gauge fields by spins 1/2, and thus simulates a quantum link model. As we show,
this allows the fermionic matter to be replaced by bosonic degrees of freedom,
permitting small-scale implementations in a linear Paul trap. Both schemes work
on energy scales significantly larger than typical decoherence rates in
experiments, thus enabling the investigation of phenomena such as string
breaking, Coleman's quantum phase transition, and false-vacuum decay. The
underlying ideas of the proposed analog simulation schemes may also be adapted
to other platforms, such as superconducting qubits.

represents a fully consistent example of a one-parameter inflationary scenario.
This model has a ""graceful exit"" from inflation and provides a mechanism for
subsequent creation and final thermalization of the standard matter. Moreover,
it produces a very good fit of the observed spectrum of primordial
perturbations. In the present paper we show explicitly that the $R^2$
inflationary spacetime is an exact solution of a range of weakly non-local
(quasi-polynomial) gravitational theories, which provide an ultraviolet
completion of the $R^2$ theory. These theories are ghost-free,
super-renormalizable or finite at quantum level, and perturbatively unitary.
Their spectrum consists of the graviton and the scalaron that is responsible
for driving the inflation. Notably, any further extension of the spectrum leads
to propagating ghost degrees of freedom. We are aimed at presenting a detailed
construction of such theories in the so called Weyl basis. Further, we give a
special account to the cosmological implications of this theory by considering
perturbations during inflation. The highlight of the non-local model is the
prediction of a modified, in comparison to a local $R^2$ model, value for the
ratio of tensor and scalar power spectra $r$, depending on the parameters of
the theory. The relevant parameters are under control to be successfully
confronted with existing observational data. Furthermore, the modified $r$ can
surely meet future observational constraints.

measuring the star's pulsation period and its rate of period change. The former
is important for calibrating the Leavitt Law and the latter for stellar
evolution modeling. In this work, we combine previous time-series observations
spanning more than a century with new observations to remeasure the pulsation
period and compute the rate of period change. We compare our new rate of period
change with stellar evolution models to measure the properties of $l$ Car, but
find models and observations are, at best, marginally consistent. The results
imply that $l$ Car does not have significantly enhanced mass-loss rates like
that measured for $\delta$ Cephei. We find that the mass of $l$ Car is about 8
- 10 $M_\odot$. We present Hubble Space Telescope COS observations that also
differ from measurements for $\delta$ Cep, and $\beta$ Dor. These measurements
further add to the challenge of understanding the physics of Cepheids, but do

collapse, at $\sim$ earth mass, up to a few percent solar. Our results confirm
that the density profiles of the first haloes are described by a $\sim
r^{-1.5}$ power-law. As haloes grow in mass, their density profiles evolve
significantly. In the central regions, they become shallower and reach on
average $\sim r^{-1}$, the asymptotic form of an NFW profile. Using
non-cosmological controlled simulations, we observe that temporal variations in
the gravitational potential caused by major mergers lead to a shallowing of the
inner profile. This transformation is more significant for shallower initial
profiles and for a higher number of merging systems. Depending on the merger
details, the resulting profiles can be shallower or steeper than NFW in their
inner regions. Interestingly, mergers have a much weaker effect when the
profile is given by a broken power-law with an inner slope of $-1$ (such as NFW
or Hernquist profiles). This offers an explanation for the emergence of
NFW-like profiles: after their initial collapse, $r^{-1.5}$ $\chi$DM haloes
suffer copious major mergers, which progressively shallows the profile. Once an
NFW-like profile is established, subsequent merging do not change the profile
anymore. This suggests that halo profiles are not universal but rather a
combination of (1) the physics of the formation of the microhaloes and (2)
their early merger history -- both set by the properties of the dark matter
particle -- as well as (3) the resilience of NFW-like profiles to

maintaining a k-mer-based index over a dynamically changing genome. SkipPatch
pairs a hash-based k-mer index with an indexable skip list that is used to

our maps allows 4$\sigma$ detection of objects brighter than $\sim 1.5$ mJy,
corresponding to protoplanetary disk masses larger than 1.5 M$_{\rm J}$ (using
standard assumptions about dust opacities and gas-to-dust ratios). None of
these disks are detected in contemporaneous CO(2-1) or C$^{18}$O(2-1)

smaller than the canonical value of 100. Furthermore, since dust grains may
already be sequestered in large bodies in ONC disks, the inferred masses of

field. Most obviously, the SEP event rate closely follows the sunspot number
and area in the same hemisphere. The $\approx$ six-month variations are
associated with features in many of the other parameters we examine, indicating
that they are just one signature of the episodic development of Cycle 24. They
may be related to the ""$\approx$150~day"" periodicities reported in various
solar and interplanetary phenomena during previous solar cycles. The clear
presence of $\approx$six-month periodicities in Cycle 24 that evolve
independently in each hemisphere conflicts with a scenario suggested by
McIntosh et al. (2015, Nature Com. 6, 6491) for the variational time scales of
solar magnetism.

We perform data-driven simulations of how stellar rotation affects planet

show that the characteristic timescales of quasi-periodic radial velocity
jitter from stellar rotational modulations coincides with the orbital period of
habitable zone exoplanets around early M-dwarfs. These coincident periods
underscore the importance of monitoring the targets of RV habitable zone planet

absolute luminosities are consistent with the same distance, confirming the
physical nature of the binary, which is the first double-lined hyper-velocity
candidate. Our spectral decomposition of the Keck/ESI spectrum provided an
sdB+K3V pair, analogous to many long-period subdwarf binaries observed in the
Galactic disk. We found the subdwarf atmospheric parameters: $T_{\rm
eff}=30\,600\pm500$ K, $\log{g}=5.57\pm0.06$ cm s$^{-2}$ and He abundance
$\log(n{\rm He}/n{\rm H})=-3.0\pm0.2$. Oxygen is the most abundant metal in the
hot subdwarf atmosphere, and Mg and Na lines are the most prominent spectral
features of the cool companion, consistent with a metallicity of $[{\rm
Fe}/{\rm H}]=-1.3$. The non-detection of radial velocity variations suggest the
orbital period to be a few hundred days, in agreement with similar binaries
observed in the disk. Using the SDSS-III flux calibrated spectrum we measured
the distance to the system $d=5.5\pm0.5$ kpc, which is consistent with
ultraviolet, optical, and infrared photometric constraints derived from binary
spectral energy distributions. Our kinematic study shows that the Galactic
rest-frame velocity of the system is so high that an unbound orbit cannot be
ruled out. On the other hand, a bound orbit requires a massive dark matter
halo. We conclude that the binary either formed in the halo or it was accreted

changed by both an external magnetic field and through the introduction of
spin-polarized electric current. Here we report the continuous repeated
switching behavior of both the reference and free layers of a perpendicular
spin valve made of Co/Pd and Co/Ni multilayers that arises for sufficiently

oscillating signal in the MHz regime but is only observed for one sign of the
applied current. The observed behavior agrees well with micromagnetic
simulations.

hardware-oriented model approximation. In this paper we present Ristretto, a
model approximation framework that analyzes a given CNN with respect to
numerical resolution used in representing weights and outputs of convolutional

arithmetic and representation instead of floating point. Moreover, Ristretto
fine-tunes the resulting fixed point network. Given a maximum error tolerance
of 1%, Ristretto can successfully condense CaffeNet and SqueezeNet to 8-bit.

model achieves an accuracy of 99.35% on a held-out test set, demonstrating the
feasibility of this approach. When testing the model on a set of images
collected from trusted online sources - i.e. taken under conditions different
from the images used for training - the model still achieves an accuracy of
31.4%. While this accuracy is much higher than the one based on random

truthfully. An example of non-truthful grading, that we observed in classrooms,
consists in students assigning the maximum grade to all submissions. With a
naive grading scheme, such as averaging the assigned grades, all students would
receive the maximum grade. In this paper, we develop three grading schemes that
provide incentives for truthful peer grading. In the first scheme, the
instructor grades a fraction p of the submissions, and penalizes students whose
grade deviates from the instructor grade. We provide lower bounds on p to
ensure truthfulness, and conclude that these schemes work only for moderate
class sizes, up to a few hundred students. To overcome this limitation, we
propose a hierarchical extension of this supervised scheme, and we show that it
can handle classes of any size with bounded (and little) instructor work, and
is therefore applicable to Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs). Finally, we
propose unsupervised incentive schemes, in which the student incentive is based
on statistical properties of the grade distribution, without any grading
required by the instructor. We show that the proposed unsupervised schemes
provide incentives to truthful grading, at the price of being possibly unfair

particles to gamma-ray emitting energies efficiently over very short time
scales. These are likely due to rapid dissipation of electromagnetic energy in
a highly magnetized, relativistic plasma. In order to understand the generic
features of such processes, we have investigated simple models based on
relaxation of unstable force-free magnetostatic equilibria. In this work, we
make the connection between the corresponding plasma dynamics and the expected
radiation signal, using 2D particle-in-cell simulations that self-consistently
include synchrotron radiation reaction. We focus on the lowest order unstable
force-free equilibrium in a 2D periodic box. We find that rapid variability,
with modest apparent radiation efficiency as perceived by a fixed observer, can
be produced during the evolution of the instability. The ""flares"" are
accompanied by an increased polarization degree in the high energy band, with
rapid variation in the polarization angle. Furthermore, the separation between
the acceleration sites and the synchrotron radiation sites for the highest
energy particles facilitates acceleration beyond the synchrotron radiation
reaction limit. We also discuss the dynamical consequences of radiation
reaction, and some astrophysical applications of this model. Our current
simulations with numerically tractable parameters are not yet able to reproduce

from these an eligible (formal, complete enough, unambiguous, consistent,
measurable, satisfiable, modifiable and traceable) requirements specification
that truly captures stakeholder needs.
  We propose Desiree, a refinement calculus for systematically transforming
stakeholder require-ments into an eligible specification. The core of the
calculus is a rich set of requirements operators that iteratively transform
stakeholder requirements by strengthening or weakening them, thereby reducing
incompleteness, removing ambiguities and vagueness, eliminating unattainability
and conflicts, turning them into an eligible specification. The framework also
includes an ontology for modeling and classifying requirements, a
description-based language for representing requirements, as well as a
systematic method for applying the concepts and operators. In addition, we
define the semantics of the requirements concepts and operators, and develop a
graphical modeling tool in support of the entire framework.
  To evaluate our proposal, we have conducted a series of empirical
evaluations, including an ontology evaluation by classifying a large public
requirements set, a language evaluation by rewriting the large set of
requirements using our description-based syntax, a method evaluation through a
realistic case study, and an evaluation of the entire framework through three
controlled experiments. The results of our evaluations show that our ontology,
language, and method are adequate in capturing requirements in practice, and
offer strong evidence that with sufficient training, our framework indeed helps
people conduct more effective requirements engineering.

tidally disrupting Milky Way (MW) globular cluster Palomar 5 and its tidal
stream. The observed fields are located to cover an angular extent of $\sim
17$\arcdeg along the stream, providing an opportunity to investigate a trend in
line-of-sight velocities ($V_{\rm los}$) along the stream, which is essential
to constrain its orbit and underlying gravitational potential of the Milky
Way's dark matter halo. A spectral fitting technique is applied to the observed
spectra to obtain stellar parameters and metallicities ([Fe/H]) of the target
stars. The 19 stars most likely belonging to the central Pal 5 cluster have a
mean $V_{\rm los}$ of $-58.1\pm 0.7$ km s$^{-1}$ and metallicity
[Fe/H]$=-1.35\pm 0.06$ dex, both of which are in good agreement with those
derived in previous high-resolution spectroscopic studies. Assuming that the
stream stars have the same [Fe/H] as the progenitor cluster, the derived [Fe/H]
and $V_{\rm los}$ values are used to estimate the possible $V_{\rm los}$ range
of the member stars at each location along the stream. Because of the heavy
contamination of the field MW stars, estimated $V_{\rm los}$ range depends on
prior assumptions about the stream's $V_{\rm los}$, which highlights the
importance of more definitely identifying the member stars using proper motion
and chemical abundances to obtain an unbiased information of $V_{\rm los}$ in
the outer part of the Pal 5 stream. The models for the gravitational potential
of the MW's dark matter halo that are compatible with the estimated $V_{\rm

formation of 3D nanostructures, whose shape and orientation is determined by
the WL thickness and thus directly related to the strain energy. The emergence
of these nanostructures, hillocks and pre-quantum dots, is studied by scanning
tunneling microscopy. A wetting layer deposited at 350 C is initially rough on
the nanometer length-scale and undergoes a progressive transformation and
smoothening until for T>460 C vacancy lines and the 2xn reconstruction are
observed. The metastable Ge wetting layer (WL) then collapses to form 3D
nanostructures whose morphology is controlled by the WL thickness: firstly,
hillocks, with a wedding cake-type structure where the step edges run parallel
to the <110> direction, are formed for thin wetting layers, while {105}-faceted
structures, so-called pre-quantum dots (p-QDs), are formed from thicker layers.
The wetting layer thickness and thus the misfit strain energy controls the type
of structure. The crossover thickness between hillock and p-QDs regime is
between 1.6 and 2.1 ML. The hillocks have larger lateral dimensions and volumes
than p-QDs, and the p-QDs are exceptionally small quantum dots with a lower
limit of 10 nm in width. Our work opens a new pathway to the control of
nanostructure morphology and size in the elastically strained Ge/Si system.

not just within each processing stage but also between adjacent (and

categories of knowledge representation and models to motivate the types of

intrinsic bandgap, which makes it especially promising for electronics
applications. In this work, we use first-principles lattice dynamics and
iterative solution of the phonon Boltzmann transport equation (BTE) to
determine the thermal conductivity of PG and its more stable derivative -
hydrogenated penta-graphene (HPG). As a comparison, we also studied the effect
of hydrogenation on graphene thermal conductivity. In contrast to hydrogenation
of graphene, which leads to a dramatic decrease in thermal conductivity (from
3590 to 1328 W/mK - a 63% reduction), HPG shows a notable increase in thermal
conductivity (615 W/mK), which is 76% higher than that of PG (350 W/mK). The
high thermal conductivity of HPG makes it more thermally conductive than most
other semi-conducting 2D materials, such as the transition metal chalcogenides.
Our detailed analyses show that the primary reason for the counter-intuitive
hydrogenation-induced thermal conductivity enhancement is the weaker bond
anharmonicity in HPG than PG. This leads to weaker phonon scattering after
hydrogenation, despite the increase in the phonon scattering phase space. The
high thermal conductivity of HPG may inspire intensive research around HPG and
other derivatives of PG as potential materials for future nanoelectronic
devices. The fundamental physics understood from this study may open up a new
strategy to engineer thermal transport properties of other 2D materials by
controlling bond anharmonicity via functionalization.

which do not benefit from the parallelism available in modern multicore
architectures. Automatically parallelizing sequential code, to promote an
efficient use of the available parallelism, has been a research goal for some
time now. This work proposes a new approach for achieving such goal. We created
a new parallelizing compiler that analyses the read and write instructions, and
control-flow modifications in programs to identify a set of dependencies
between the instructions in the program. Afterwards, the compiler, based on the
generated dependencies graph, rewrites and organizes the program in a
task-oriented structure. Parallel tasks are composed by instructions that
cannot be executed in parallel. A work-stealing-based parallel runtime is
responsible for scheduling and managing the granularity of the generated tasks.
Furthermore, a compile-time granularity control mechanism also avoids creating
unnecessary data-structures. This work focuses on the Java language, but the
techniques are general enough to be applied to other programming languages. We
have evaluated our approach on 8 benchmark programs against OoOJava, achieving
higher speedups. In some cases, values were close to those of a manual
parallelization. The resulting parallel code also has the advantage of being
readable and easily configured to improve further its performance manually.

emotions, cognitive science, and social interactions. In this paper, we present
a novel method for fully automatic facial expression recognition in facial
image sequences. As the facial expression evolves over time facial landmarks
are automatically tracked in consecutive video frames, using displacements
based on elastic bunch graph matching displacement estimation. Feature vectors
from individual landmarks, as well as pairs of landmarks tracking results are
extracted, and normalized, with respect to the first frame in the sequence. The
prototypical expression sequence for each class of facial expression is formed,
by taking the median of the landmark tracking results from the training facial
expression sequences. Multi-class AdaBoost with dynamic time warping similarity
distance between the feature vector of input facial expression and prototypical
facial expression, is used as a weak classifier to select the subset of
discriminative feature vectors. Finally, two methods for facial expression
recognition are presented, either by using multi-class AdaBoost with dynamic
time warping, or by using support vector machine on the boosted feature
vectors. The results on the Cohn-Kanade (CK+) facial expression database show a
recognition accuracy of 95.17% and 97.35% using multi-class AdaBoost and
support vector machines, respectively.

performance when processing massive volume of on-line transactions on modern

transaction-level logging-and-recovery mechanisms, either degrade the
performance of transaction processing or slow down the process of failure
recovery. In this paper, we show that, by exploiting application semantics, it
is possible to achieve speedy failure recovery without introducing any costly
logging overhead to the execution of concurrent transactions. We propose
PACMAN, a parallel database recovery mechanism that is specifically designed
for lightweight, coarse-grained transaction-level logging. PACMAN leverages a
combination of static and dynamic analyses to parallelize the log recovery: at
compile time, PACMAN decomposes stored procedures by carefully analyzing
dependencies within and across programs; at recovery time, PACMAN exploits the
availability of the runtime parameter values to attain an execution schedule
with a high degree of parallelism. As such, recovery performance is remarkably
increased. We evaluated PACMAN in a fully-fledged main-memory DBMS running on a
40-core machine. Compared to several state-of-the-art database recovery
mechanisms, PACMAN can significantly reduce recovery time without compromising
the efficiency of transaction processing.

For contemporary massive data sets, RAM-based algorithms become impractical.
And although there exist good sequential algorithms for k-center, they are not

  In this paper, we design and implement parallel approximation algorithms for
this problem. We observe that Gonzalez's greedy algorithm can be efficiently
parallelized in several MapReduce rounds; in practice, we find that two rounds
are sufficient, leading to a 4-approximation. We contrast this with an existing
parallel algorithm for k-center that runs in a constant number of rounds, and
offers a 10-approximation. In depth runtime analysis reveals that this scheme
is often slow, and that its sampling procedure only runs if k is sufficiently
small, relative to the input size. To trade off runtime for approximation
guarantee, we parameterize this sampling algorithm, and find in our experiments
that the algorithm is not only faster, but sometimes more effective. Yet the
parallel version of Gonzalez is about 100 times faster than both its sequential
version and the parallel sampling algorithm, barely compromising solution

to crystal defects can be detrimental to the material's optoelectronic
properties. Semiconductors with lower tendency to form defect induced deep gap
states are termed defect tolerant. Here we provide a systematic first
principles investigation of defect tolerance in 29 monolayer transition metal
dichalcogenides (TMDs) of interest for nanoscale optoelectronics. We find that
the TMDs based on group VI and X metals form deep gap states upon creation of a
chalcogen (S, Se, Te) vacancy while the TMDs based on group IV metals form only
shallow defect levels and are thus predicted to be defect tolerant.
Interestingly, all the defect sensitive TMDs have valence and conduction bands
with very similar orbital composition. This indicates a bonding/anti-bonding
nature of the gap which in turn suggests that dangling bonds will fall inside
the gap. These ideas are made quantitative by introducing a descriptor that
measures the degree of similarity of the conduction and valence band manifolds.
Finally, the study is generalized to non-polar nanoribbons of the TMDs where we
find that only the defect sensitive materials form edge states within the band
gap.

Maintaining a database index incurs high latency because the DBMS has to find

paper proposes Hippo a fast, yet scalable, database indexing approach. Hippo
only stores the pointers of disk pages along with light weight histogram-based
summaries. The proposed structure significantly shrinks index storage and

Experiments, based on real Hippo implementation inside PostgreSQL 9.5, using

solution is the R-CNN framework and its fast versions. They decompose the
object detection problem into two cascaded easier tasks: 1) generating object
proposals from images, 2) classifying proposals into various object categories.
Despite that we are handling with two relatively easier tasks, they are not
solved perfectly and there's still room for improvement. In this paper, we push
the ""divide and conquer"" solution even further by dividing each task into two
sub-tasks. We call the proposed method ""CRAFT"" (Cascade Region-proposal-network
And FasT-rcnn), which tackles each task with a carefully designed network
cascade. We show that the cascade structure helps in both tasks: in proposal
generation, it provides more compact and better localized object proposals; in
object classification, it reduces false positives (mainly between ambiguous
categories) by capturing both inter- and intra-category variances. CRAFT
achieves consistent and considerable improvement over the state-of-the-art on

they and/or those they interact with are healthy or sick. Healthy individuals
are concerned about contracting a disease from their sick contacts and may
utilize protective measures. Sick individuals may be concerned with spreading
the disease to their healthy contacts and adopt preemptive measures. Yet, in
practice both protective and preemptive changes in behavior come with costs.
This paper proposes a stochastic network disease game model that captures the
self-interests of individuals during the spread of a
susceptible-infected-susceptible (SIS) disease where individuals react to
current risk of disease spread, and their reactions together with the current
state of the disease stochastically determine the next stage of the disease. We
show that there is a critical level of concern, i.e., empathy, by the sick
individuals above which disease is eradicated fast. Furthermore, we find that
if the network and disease parameters are above the epidemic threshold, the
risk averse behavior by the healthy individuals cannot eradicate the disease
without the preemptive measures of the sick individuals. This imbalance in the
role played by the response of the infected versus the susceptible individuals
in disease eradication affords critical policy insights.

landscape of protein interacting patterns, enable us to explore biological
processes and cellular components at multiple resolutions. For a biological
process, a number of proteins need to work together to perform the job.
Proteins densely interact with each other, forming large molecular machines or
cellular building blocks. Identification of such densely interconnected
clusters or protein complexes from PPI networks enables us to obtain a better
understanding of the hierarchy and organization of biological processes and
cellular components. Most existing methods apply efficient graph clustering
algorithms on PPI networks, often failing to detect possible densely connected
subgraphs and overlapped subgraphs. Besides clustering-based methods, dense
subgraph enumeration methods have also been used, which aim to find all densely
connected protein sets. However, such methods are not practically tractable
even on a small yeast PPI network, due to high computational complexity. In
this paper, we introduce a novel approximate algorithm to efficiently enumerate
putative protein complexes from biological networks. The key insight of our
algorithm is that we do not need to enumerate all dense subgraphs. Instead we
only need to find a small subset of subgraphs that cover as many proteins as
possible. The problem is formulated as finding a diverse set of dense
subgraphs, where we develop highly effective pruning techniques to guarantee
efficiency. To handle large networks, we take a divide-and-conquer approach to
speed up the algorithm in a distributed manner. By comparing with existing
clustering and dense subgraph-based algorithms on several human and yeast PPI
networks, we demonstrate that our method can detect more putative protein
complexes and achieves better prediction accuracy.

other D2D links, which imposes a great technical challenge to radio resource
allocation. Conventional graph based resource allocation methods typically
consider the interference between two user equipments (UEs), but they cannot
model the interference from multiple UEs to completely characterize the
interference. In this paper, we study channel allocation using hypergraph
theory to coordinate the interference between D2D pairs and cellular UEs, where
an arbitrary number of D2D pairs are allowed to share the uplink channels with
the cellular UEs. Hypergraph coloring is used to model the cumulative
interference from multiple D2D pairs, and thus, eliminate the mutual

improved using the proposed hypergraph method in comparison to the conventional

have clutter background, occlusions or different lighting conditions. In the
past, many descriptors have been proposed which aid object categorization even
in such adverse conditions. Each descriptor has its own merits and de-merits.
Some descriptors are invariant to transformations while the others are more
discriminative. Past research has shown that, employing multiple descriptors
rather than any single descriptor leads to better recognition. The problem of
learning the optimal combination of the available descriptors for a particular
classification task is studied. Multiple Kernel Learning (MKL) framework has
been developed for learning an optimal combination of descriptors for object
categorization. Existing MKL formulations often employ block l-1 norm
regularization which is equivalent to selecting a single kernel from a library
of kernels. Since essentially a single descriptor is selected, the existing
formulations maybe sub- optimal for object categorization. A MKL formulation
based on block l-infinity norm regularization has been developed, which chooses
an optimal combination of kernels as opposed to selecting a single kernel. A
Composite Multiple Kernel Learning(CKL) formulation based on mixed l-infinity
and l-1 norm regularization has been developed. These formulations end in
Second Order Cone Programs(SOCP). Other efficient alter- native algorithms for
these formulation have been implemented. Empirical results on benchmark
datasets show significant improvement using these new MKL formulations.

first major step for many RNA-seq analysis tasks. Current methods for de novo
assembly often report a large number of contiguous sequences (contigs), which
may be fractured and incomplete sequences instead of full-length transcripts.
Dealing with a large number of such contigs can slow and complicate downstream
analysis.
  Results :We present a method for clustering contigs from de novo
transcriptome assemblies based upon the relationships exposed by multi-mapping
sequencing fragments. Specifically, we cast the problem of clustering contigs
as one of clustering a sparse graph that is induced by equivalence classes of
fragments that map to subsets of the transcriptome. Leveraging recent
developments in efficient read mapping and transcript quantification, we have
developed RapClust, a tool implementing this approach that is capable of
accurately clustering most large de novo transcriptomes in a matter of minutes,
while simultaneously providing accurate estimates of expression for the
resulting clusters. We compare RapClust against a number of tools commonly used
for de novo transcriptome clustering. Using de novo assemblies of organisms for
which reference genomes are available, we assess the accuracy of these
different methods in terms of the quality of the resulting clusterings, and the
concordance of differential expression tests with those based on ground truth
clusters. We find that RapClust produces clusters of comparable or better
quality than existing state-of-the-art approaches, and does so substantially
faster. RapClust also confers a large benefit in terms of space usage, as it
produces only succinct intermediate files - usually on the order of a few
megabytes - even when processing hundreds of millions of reads.

underlying microstructure and dynamics in different patterned-states. At small
shaking accelerations ($\Gamma=A\omega^2/g <1$), the particles remain attached
with the base of the vibrating container -- this is known as the solid bed
(SB). With increasing $\Gamma$ (at large enough shaking amplitude $A/d$) and/or
with increasing $A/d$ (at large enough $\Gamma$), the sequence of
transitions/bifurcations unfolds as follows: SB to BB (""bouncing bed"") to LS
(""Leidenfrost state"") to ""2-roll Convection"" to ""1-roll Convection"" and finally
to a gas-like state. For a given length of the container, the coarsening of
multiple convection rolls leading to the genesis of a ""single-roll"" structure
(dubbed the {\it multi-roll transition}), and its subsequent transition to a
granular-gas are two novel findings of this work. We show that the critical
shaking intensity ($\Gamma_{BB}^{LS}$) for ""$BB\to LS$""-transition has a
power-law dependence on the particle loading ($F=h_0/d$, where $h_0$ is the
number of particle layers at rest and $d$ is the particle diameter) and the
shaking amplitude ($A/d$). The characteristics of $BB$ and $LS$ states are
studied by calculating (i) the coarse-grained density and temperature profiles
and (ii) the pair correlation function. It is shown that while the contact
network of particles in the BB represents a hexagonal-packed structure, the
contact network within the LS resembles a liquid-like state. An unsteadiness of
the LS has been uncovered wherein the interface (between the floating-cluster
and the dilute gas underneath) and the top of the bed are found to oscillate
sinusoidally, with its oscillation frequency closely matching with the

We identified more than 5000 rotational transitions, pertaining to more than

training deep neural networks. However, their convergence analysis is still
underexplored at the moment, in particular for non-convex optimization. This
paper fills the gap between practice and theory by developing a basic
convergence analysis of two stochastic momentum methods, namely stochastic
heavy-ball method and the stochastic variant of Nesterov's accelerated gradient
method. We hope that the basic convergence results developed in this paper can
serve the reference to the convergence of stochastic momentum methods and also
serve the baselines for comparison in future development of stochastic momentum
methods. The novelty of convergence analysis presented in this paper is a
unified framework, revealing more insights about the similarities and
differences between different stochastic momentum methods and stochastic
gradient method. The unified framework exhibits a continuous change from the
gradient method to Nesterov's accelerated gradient method and finally the
heavy-ball method incurred by a free parameter, which can help explain a
similar change observed in the testing error convergence behavior for deep
learning. Furthermore, our empirical results for optimizing deep neural
networks demonstrate that the stochastic variant of Nesterov's accelerated
gradient method achieves a good tradeoff (between speed of convergence in
training error and robustness of convergence in testing error) among the three
stochastic methods.

as a function of temperature ($T$) the viscosity-to-entropy ratio behaves as
$\eta/s \sim 1/T^4$; as a function of net-baryon density ($n_B$), $\eta/s \sim
1/s$, i.e. it is mainly determined by the density dependence of the entropy
density. The above dependencies take place along the dynamical trajectories of

pair-copulas as building blocks. However if the number of variables grows the
problem gets fast intractable. For dealing with this problem Brechmann at al.
proposed the truncated R-vine copulas. The truncated R-vine copula has the very
useful property that it can be constructed by using only pair-wise copulas, and
conditional pair-wise copulas. In our earlier papers we introduced the concept
of cherry-tree copulas. In this paper we characterize the relation between the
cherry-tree copulas and the truncated R-vine copulas. Both are based on
exploiting of some conditional independences between the variables. We give a
necessary and sufficient condition for a cherry-tree copula to be a truncated
R-vine copula. We introduce a new perspective for truncated R-vine modeling.
The new idea is finding first a good fitting cherry-tree copula of order $k$.
Then, if this is also a truncated R-vine copula we apply the Backward Algorithm
introduced in this paper. This way the construction of a sequence of trees
which leads to it becomes possible. So the cherry-tree copula can be expressed
by pair-copulas and conditional pair-copulas. In the case when the fitted $k$
order cherry-tree copula is not a truncated R-vine copula we give an algorithm
to transform it into truncated R-vine copula at level $k+1$. Therefore this

and frequency-dependent instrument sampling. We assess different options for
bandpass calibration. The analysis is applied to the proposed SKA1-Low EoR/CD
experiments. We provide tolerances on the smoothness of the SKA station primary
beam bandpass, to meet the scientific goals of statistical and tomographic
(imaging) EoR programs. Two calibration strategies are tested: (1) fitting of
each fine channel independently, and (2) fitting of an nth-order polynomial for
each ~1~MHz coarse channel with (n+1)th-order residuals (n=2,3,4). Strategy (1)
leads to uncorrelated power in the 2D power spectrum proportional to the
thermal noise power, thereby reducing the overall array sensitivity. Strategy
(2) leads to correlated residuals from the fitting, and residual signal power
with (n+1)th-order curvature. For the residual power to be less than the
thermal noise, the fractional amplitude of a fourth-order term in the bandpass
across a single coarse channel must be <2.5% (50~MHz), <0.5% (150~MHz), <0.8%
(200~MHz). The tomographic experiment places stringent constraints on phase
residuals in the bandpass. We find that the root-mean-square variability over

This is ideal to model binary decision variables, but less useful for variables
taking more values. With very little theoretical work existing on how to use
evolutionary algorithms for such optimization problems, we study the run time
of simple evolutionary algorithms on some OneMax-like functions defined over
$\Omega = \{0, 1, \dots, r-1\}^n$. More precisely, we regard a variety of
problem classes requesting the component-wise minimization of the distance to
an unknown target vector $z \in \Omega$. For such problems we see a crucial
difference in how we extend the standard-bit mutation operator to these
multi-valued domains. While it is natural to select each position of the
solution vector to be changed independently with probability $1/n$, there are
various ways to then change such a position. If we change each selected
position to a random value different from the original one, we obtain an
expected run time of $\Theta(nr \log n)$. If we change each selected position
by either $+1$ or $-1$ (random choice), the optimization time reduces to
$\Theta(nr + n\log n)$. If we use a random mutation strength $i \in
\{0,1,\ldots,r-1\}^n$ with probability inversely proportional to $i$ and change
the selected position by either $+i$ or $-i$ (random choice), then the
optimization time becomes $\Theta(n \log(r)(\log(n)+\log(r)))$, bringing down
the dependence on $r$ from linear to polylogarithmic. One of our results
depends on a new variant of the lower bounding multiplicative drift theorem.

  (BIG) Data",,,,,"stat.ML cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Decision tree classifiers are a widely used tool in data stream mining. The
use of confidence intervals to estimate the gain associated with each split
leads to very effective methods, like the popular Hoeffding tree algorithm.
From a statistical viewpoint, the analysis of decision tree classifiers in a
streaming setting requires knowing when enough new information has been
collected to justify splitting a leaf. Although some of the issues in the
statistical analysis of Hoeffding trees have been already clarified, a general
and rigorous study of confidence intervals for splitting criteria is missing.
We fill this gap by deriving accurate confidence intervals to estimate the
splitting gain in decision tree learning with respect to three criteria:
entropy, Gini index, and a third index proposed by Kearns and Mansour. Our
confidence intervals depend in a more detailed way on the tree parameters. We
also extend our confidence analysis to a selective sampling setting, in which
the decision tree learner adaptively decides which labels to query in the
stream. We furnish theoretical guarantee bounding the probability that the
classification is non-optimal learning the decision tree via our selective
sampling strategy. Experiments on real and synthetic data in a streaming
setting show that our trees are indeed more accurate than trees with the same
number of leaves generated by other techniques and our active learning module
permits to save labeling cost. In addition, comparing our labeling strategy
with recent methods, we show that our approach is more robust and consistent
respect all the other techniques applied to incremental decision trees.

eliminate backhaul bottleneck in heterogeneous networks (HetNets). In this
paper, we investigate the optimal content placement maximizing the successful
offloading probability in a cache-enabled HetNet where a tier of multi-antenna
macro BSs (MBSs) is overlaid with a tier of helpers with caches. Based on
probabilistic caching framework, we resort to stochastic geometry theory to
derive the closed-form successful offloading probability and formulate the
caching probability optimization problem, which is not concave in general. In
two extreme cases with high and low user-to-helper density ratios, we obtain
the optimal caching probability and analyze the impacts of BS density and
transmit power of the two tiers and the signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio
(SINR) threshold. In general case, we obtain the optimal caching probability
that maximizes the lower bound of successful offloading probability and analyze
the impact of user density. Simulation and numerical results show that when the
ratios of MBS-to-helper density, MBS-to-helper transmit power and
user-to-helper density, and the SINR threshold are large, the optimal caching
policy tends to cache the most popular files everywhere.

the following conjecture: coefficients of $\psi$ are polynomials in $\beta$
with positive integer coefficients that can be written as a multivariate
generating series of rooted, general bipartite maps, where the exponent of
$\beta$ is an integer-valued statistic that in some sense ""measures the

exists a third special value $\beta = -1$ for which the coefficients of $\psi$
indexed by two partitions $\mu,\nu$, and one partition with only one part are
given by rooted, orientable bipartite maps with arbitrary face degrees and
black/white vertex degrees given by $\mu$/$\nu$, respectively. We show that
this evaluation corresponds, up to a sign, to a top-degree part of the

integer-valued statistics of maps $(\eta)$ such that the top-degree of the
multivariate generating series of rooted bipartite maps with only one face
(called unicellular) with respect to $\eta$ gives the top-degree of the
appropriate coefficients of $\psi$. Finally, we show that the $b$-conjecture

attention in recent years as a natural extension of orthogonal matching
pursuit. It is used to recover sparse signals in compressive sensing. In this
paper, a new bound is obtained for the exact reconstruction of every $K$-sparse
signal via the gOMP algorithm in the noiseless case. That is, if the restricted
isometry constant (RIC) $\delta_{NK+1}$ of the sensing matrix $A$ satisfies
\begin{eqnarray*} \delta_{NK+1}<\frac{1}{\sqrt{\frac{K}{N}+1}}, \end{eqnarray*}
then the gOMP can perfectly recover every $K$-sparse signal $x$ from $y=Ax$.
Furthermore, the bound is proved to be sharp in the following sense. For any
given positive integer $K$, we construct a matrix $A$ with the RIC
\begin{eqnarray*} \delta_{NK+1}=\frac{1}{\sqrt{\frac{K}{N}+1}} \end{eqnarray*}
such that the gOMP may fail to recover some $K$-sparse signal $x$.
  In the noise case, an extra condition on the minimum magnitude of the nonzero
components of every $K-$sparse signal combining with the above bound on RIC of
the sensing matrix $A$ is sufficient to recover the true support of every
$K$-sparse signal by the gOMP.

obtained from their resolved stellar populations is relevant as a test for
cosmological models. However, the early time resolution of observationally
derived SFHs is limited by several factors. Thus, direct comparison of
observationally derived SFHs with those derived from theoretical models of
galaxy formation is potentially biased. Here we investigate and quantify this
effect. For this purpose, we analyze the duration of the early star formation
activity in a sample of four Local Group dwarf galaxies and test whether they
are consistent with being true fossils of the pre-reionization era; i.e., if
the quenching of their star formation occurred before cosmic reionization by UV
photons was completed. Two classical dSph (Cetus and Tucana) and two dTrans
(LGS-3 and Phoenix) isolated galaxies with total stellar masses between
$1.3\times 10^6$ to $7.2\times 10^6$ M$_\odot$ have been studied. Accounting
for time resolution effects, the SFHs peak as much as 1.25 Gyr earlier than the
optimal solutions. Thus, this effect is important for a proper comparison of
model and observed SFHs. It is also shown that none of the analyzed galaxies
can be considered a true-fossil of the pre-reionization era, although it is
possible that the {\it outer regions} of Cetus and Tucana are consistent with
quenching by reionization.

provide consistent motion planning encountering both environmental dynamic
changes and a priori knowledge of the terrain, so that the AUV is reactively
guided to the target of interest in the context of an unknown underwater
environment. The architecture involves three main modules: The GRP module at
the top level deals with the task priority assignment, mission time management,
and determination of a feasible route between start and destination point in a
large scale environment. The LPP module at the lower level deals with safety
considerations and generates collision-free optimal trajectory between each
specific pair of waypoints listed in obtained global route. Re-planning module
tends to promote robustness and reactive ability of the AUV with respect to the
environmental changes. The experimental results for different simulated

proposed scheme in enhancement of the vehicles autonomy in terms of mission

However, it is not very well constrained, either by climate models or by
observational data. The reasons for this include strong internal variability
and forcing on many time scales. In practise this means that the 'equilibrium'
will only be relative to fixing the slow feedback processes before comparing
palaeoclimate sensitivity estimates with estimates from model simulations. In
addition, information from the late Pleistocene ice age cycles indicates that
the climate cycles between cold and warm regimes, and the climate sensitivity
varies considerably between regime because of fast feedback processes changing
relative strength and time scales over one cycle.
  In this paper we consider climate sensitivity for quite general climate
dynamics. Using a conceptual Earth system model of Gildor and Tziperman (2001)
(with Milankovich forcing and dynamical ocean biogeochemistry) we explore
various ways of quantifying the state-dependence of climate sensitivity from
unperturbed and perturbed model time series. Even without considering any
perturbations, we suggest that climate sensitivity can be usefully thought of
as a distribution that quantifies variability within the 'climate attractor'
and where there is a strong dependence on climate state and more specificially
on the 'climate regime' where fast processes are approximately in equilibrium.
We also consider perturbations by instantaneous doubling of CO$_2$ and
similarly find a strong dependence on the climate state using our approach.

developing ultra-sensitive light detectors based on superconductors for

Cooper pairs oscillate and acquire kinetic inductance, that can be measured by
inserting the superconductor in a LC circuit with high merit factor.
Interactions in the superconductor can break the Cooper pairs, causing sizable
variations in the kinetic inductance and, thus, in the response of the LC
circuit. The continuous monitoring of the amplitude and frequency modulation
allows to reconstruct the incident energy with excellent sensitivity. This
concept is at the basis of Kinetic Inductance Detectors (KIDs), that are
characterized by natural aptitude to multiplexed read-out (several sensors can
be tuned to different resonant frequencies and coupled to the same line),
resolution of few eV, stable behavior over a wide temperature range, and ease
in fabrication. We present the results obtained by the CALDER collaboration

neutrinos by using the experimental data on the neutrino mass squared
differences, the mixing angles $\theta_{12}$ and $\theta_{23}$. The most
favored region of $\sin\theta_{13}$ is around $0.13\sim 0.15$, which is

$\delta_{CP}$ is favored to be close to $\pm \pi/2$. We also discuss the

remarkable that we can perform a ""complete experiment"" to determine the

consist of an ultrasoft component described by an accretion disc blackbody

that found for the canonical soft excess emission from radio-quiet NLS1s. The
UV spectrum is described by a power law with photon index 3.05^{+0.56}_{-0.33}.
The observed UV emission is too strong to arise from the accretion disc or the
host galaxy, but can be attributed to a jet. The X-ray emission from RX
J1633.3+4719 is variable with fractional variability amplitude $F_{\rm
var}$=13.5$\pm1.0$ per cent. In contrast to radio-quiet active galactic nuclei
(AGN), X-ray emission from the source becomes harder with increasing flux. The
fractional rms variability increases with energy and the rms spectrum is well
described by a constant disc component and a variable power-law continuum with
the normalization and photon index being anticorrelated. Such spectral
variability cannot be caused by variations in the absorption and must be
intrinsic to the hot corona. Our finding of possible evidence for emission from
the inner accretion disc, jet and hot corona from RX J1633.3+4719 in the

computationally efficient joint estimation and tracking of the time of arrival
(ToA) and direction of arrival (DoA) of the user nodes (UNs) using uplink
reference signals. Then, a second EKF stage is proposed in order to fuse the
individual DoA/ToA estimates from one or several ANs into a UN position
estimate. Since all the processing takes place at the network side, the
computing complexity and energy consumption at the UN side are kept to a
minimum. The cascaded EKFs proposed in this article also take into account the
unavoidable relative clock offsets between UNs and ANs, such that reliable
clock synchronization of the access-link is obtained as a valuable by-product.
The proposed cascaded EKF scheme is then revised and extended to more general
and challenging scenarios where not only the UNs have clock offsets against the
network time, but also the ANs themselves are not mutually synchronized in
time. Finally, comprehensive performance evaluations of the proposed solutions
on a realistic 5G network setup, building on the METIS project based outdoor

are provided. The obtained results clearly demonstrate that by using the
developed methods, sub-meter scale positioning and tracking accuracy of moving

weather has been added to the UK and other national risk registers. By their
very nature, extreme space weather events occur rarely and, therefore,
statistical methods are required to determine the probability of their
occurrence. Space weather events can be characterised by a number of natural
phenomena such as X-ray (solar) flares, solar energetic particle (SEP) fluxes,
coronal mass ejections and various geophysical indices (Dst, Kp, F10.7). In
this paper extreme value theory (EVT) is used to investigate the probability of
extreme solar flares. Previous work has assumed that the distribution of solar
flares follows a power law. However such an approach can lead to a poor
estimation of the return times of such events due to uncertainties in the tails
of the probability distribution function. Using EVT and GOES X-ray flux data it
is shown that the expected 150-year return level is approximately an X60 flare
whilst a Carrington-like flare is a one in a 100-year event. It is also shown
that the EVT results are consistent with flare data from the Kepler space
telescope mission.

linearly coupled to the gravitational waves and lead to a circularly polarized
tensor power spectrum comparable to the unpolarized vacuum power spectrum.

that the line is the most prominent part of a disk wind with an apparent
outflow speed of v = 0.04c. This interpretation is preferred at the 4 sigma
level over a scenario in which the line is H-like Fe XXVI at a modest

stability. When our goal is to release real-valued queries (statistics)
computed over a dataset, this notion does not require the queries to be of
bounded sensitivity -- a condition that is generally assumed under differential
privacy [DMNS06, Dwork06] when used as a notion of algorithmic stability
[DFHPRR15a, DFHPRR15b, BNSSSU16] -- nor does it require the samples in the
dataset to be independent -- a condition that is usually assumed when
generalization-error guarantees are sought. Instead, typical stability requires
the output of the query, when computed on a dataset drawn from the underlying
distribution, to be concentrated around its expected value with respect to that
distribution.
  We discuss the implications of typical stability on the generalization error
(i.e., the difference between the value of the query computed on the dataset
and the expected value of the query with respect to the true data
distribution). We show that typical stability can control generalization error
in adaptive data analysis even when the samples in the dataset are not
necessarily independent and when queries to be computed are not necessarily of
bounded-sensitivity as long as the results of the queries over the dataset
(i.e., the computed statistics) follow a distribution with a ""light"" tail.
Examples of such queries include, but not limited to, subgaussian and
subexponential queries.
  We also discuss the composition guarantees of typical stability and prove
composition theorems that characterize the degradation of the parameters of
typical stability under $k$-fold adaptive composition. We also give simple
noise-addition algorithms that achieve this notion. These algorithms are
similar to their differentially private counterparts, however, the added noise
is calibrated differently.

the advantage of being wellcontrolled without any caution of no-oxygen

surface-attached PNIPAM hydrogels collapse similarly but without complete
expulsion of water. For temperature below LCST, the swelling of PNIPAM
hydrogels depends on the film thickness. It is shown that the swelling is
strongly affected by the surface attachment for ultrathin films below $\sim$150
nm. For thicker films above 150 nm (to micrometers), surface-attached polymer
networks with the same cross-link density swell equally. The density profile of
the hydrogel films in the direction normal to the substrate is confronted with

This expression is homogeneous of degree minus 2. However, when we try to
realize it as a self-adjoint operator for real $\alpha$, or closed operator for
complex $\alpha$, we find that this homogeneity can be broken.
  This leads to a definition of two holomorphic families of closed operators on
$L^2({\mathbb R}_+)$, which we denote $H_{m,\kappa}$ and $H_0^\nu$, with
$m^2=\alpha$, $-1<\Re(m)<1$, and where $\kappa,\nu\in{\mathbb C}\cup\{\infty\}$
specify the boundary condition at $0$. We study these operators using their
explicit solvability in terms of Bessel-type functions and the Gamma function.
In particular, we show that their point spectrum has a curious shape: a string
of eigenvalues on a piece of a spiral. Their continuous spectrum is always
$[0,\infty[$. Restricted to their continuous spectrum, we diagonalize these
operators using a generalization of the Hankel transformation. We also study
their scattering theory.
  These operators are usually non-self-adjoint. Nevertheless, it is possible to
use concepts typical for the self-adjoint case to study them. Let us also
stress that $-1<\Re(m)<1$ is the maximal region of parameters for which the
operators $H_{m,\kappa}$ can be defined within the framework of the Hilbert
space $L^2({\mathbb R}_+)$.

resonant capture at low eccentricities. Furthermore, we study the resonant

Therefore, in this paper, we introduce the notion of local orthogonality, under
which the training sequence of a user is orthogonal to those of the other users

that the proposed training design yields a scalable solution to sustain the

associated with the topology of vortex lines within the fluid. In superfluids,
the vorticity is concentrated along vortex filaments. In this setting, helicity
would be expected to acquire its simplest form. However, the lack of a core
structure for vortex filaments appears to result in a helicity that does not
retain its key attribute as a quadratic invariant. By defining a spanwise
vector to the vortex through the use of a Seifert framing, we are able to
introduce twist and henceforth recover the key properties of helicity. We
present several examples for calculating internal twist to illustrate why the
centreline helicity alone will lead to ambiguous results if a twist
contribution is not introduced. Our choice of the spanwise vector can be
expressed in terms of the tangential component of velocity along the filament.
Since the tangential velocity does not alter the configuration of the vortex at
later times, we are able to recover a similar equation for the internal twist
angle for classical vortex tubes. Our results allow us to explain how a
quasi-classical limit of helicity emerges from helicity considerations for
individual superfluid vortex filaments.

The latter includes radiative and adiabatic losses, diffusion, and advection on

spatial evolution of flux and photon index of the X-ray synchrotron emission is
modelled for the three nebulae G21.5-0.9, the inner regions of Vela, and 3C 58,
thereby allowing us to derive governing parameters: the magnetic field
strength, average flow velocity and spatial diffusion coefficient. For
comparison, the nebulae are also modelled with the semi-analytic Kennel &
Coroniti (1984) model but the Porth et al. (2014) model generally yields better
fits to the observational data. We find that high velocity fluctuations in the
turbulent nebula (downstream of the termination shock) give rise to efficient
diffusive transport of particles, with average P\'eclet number close to unity,
indicating that both advection and diffusion play an important role in particle
transport. We find that the diffusive transport coefficient of the order of
$\sim2\times 10^{27} (L_{\rm s}/0.42\rm Ly) cm^{2}s^{-1}$ ($L_{\rm s}$ is the

states of the bosonic string, we compute the soft limit when one of the states
becomes soft to subsubleading order in the soft momentum expansion, and we show
that when the soft state is a graviton or a dilaton, the full string amplitude
can be expressed as a soft theorem through subsubleading order. It turns out
that there are string corrections to the field theoretical limit in the case of
a soft graviton, while for a soft dilaton the string corrections vanish. We
then show that the new soft theorems, including the string corrections, can be
simply obtained from the exchange diagrams where the soft state is attached to
the other external states through the three-point string vertex of three
massless states. In the soft-limit, the propagator of the exchanged state is
divergent, and at tree-level these are the only divergent contributions to the
full amplitude. However, they do not form a gauge invariant subset and must be
supplemented with extra non-singular terms. The requirement of gauge invariance
then fixes the complete amplitude through subsubleading order in the soft
expansion, reproducing exactly what one gets from the explicit calculation in
string theory. From this it is seen that the string corrections at
subsubleading order arise as a consequence of the three-point amplitude having
string corrections in the bosonic string. When specialized to a soft dilaton,
it remarkably turns out that the string corrections vanish and that the
non-singular piece of the subsubleading term of the dilaton soft theorem is the
generator of space-time special conformal transformation.

  (ASAP)","Vertex Coloring with Communication and Local Memory Constraints in
  Synchronous Broadcast Networks",,,,,"cs.DC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The vertex coloring problem has received a lot of attention in the context of
synchronous round-based systems where, at each round, a process can send a
message to all its neighbors, and receive a message from each of them. Hence,
this communication model is particularly suited to point-to-point communication
channels. Several vertex coloring algorithms suited to these systems have been
proposed. They differ mainly in the number of rounds they require and the
number of colors they use. This paper considers a broadcast/receive
communication model in which message collisions and message conflicts can occur
(a collision occurs when, during the same round, messages are sent to the same
process by too many neighbors; a conflict occurs when a process and one of its
neighbors broadcast during the same round). This communication model is suited
to systems where processes share communication bandwidths. More precisely,the
paper considers the case where, during a round, a process may either broadcast
a message to its neighbors or receive a message from at most $m$ of them. This
captures communication-related constraints or a local memory constraint stating
that, whatever the number of neighbors of a process, its local memory allows it
to receive and store at most $m$ messages during each round. The paper defines
first the corresponding generic vertex multi-coloring problem (a vertex can
have several colors). It focuses then on tree networks, for which it presents a
lower bound on the number of colors $K$ that are necessary (namely,
$K=\lceil\frac{\Delta}{m}\rceil+1$, where $\Delta$ is the maximal degree of the
communication graph), and an ssociated coloring algorithm, which is optimal
with respect to $K$.

irradiating host star and/or by the rotation of the objects that changes during
its lifetime. Thermal gas ionisation in these ultra-cool but dense atmospheres
allows electrostatic interactions and magnetic coupling of a substantial
atmosphere volume. Combined with a strong magnetic field $\gg B_{\rm Earth}$, a
chromosphere and aurorae might form as suggested by radio and X-ray
observations of brown dwarfs. Non-equilibrium processes like cosmic ray
ionisation and discharge processes in clouds will increase the local pool of
free electrons in the gas. Cosmic rays and lighting discharges also alter the
composition of the local atmospheric gas such that tracer molecules might be
identified. Cosmic rays affect the atmosphere through air showers which was
modelled with a 3D Monte Carlo radiative transfer code to be able to visualise

particles is too inefficient to cause an electrostatic disruption of the cloud
particles. Cloud particles will therefore not be destroyed by Coulomb explosion
for the local temperature in the collisional dominated brown dwarf and giant

electrostatically in regions with strong gas ionisation. The potential size of
such cloud holes would, however, be too small and might occur too far inside

disk temperature is determined by the balance between X-ray heating and various
cooling, and the disk is almost supported by thermal pressure. Contrary to
\citet{krolik07:_agn}, the radiation pressure by IR photons is not effective to
thicken the disk, but rather compresses it. Thus, it seems difficult for a
radiation-supported, geometrically-thick, obscuring torus to form near the dust
sublimation radius as far as the Eddington ratio is high ($\sim 1$). The mass
outflow rate is $0.05$-$0.1\;\mathrm{M_{\odot}}/\mathrm{yr}$ and the column

extended to larger radii ($r\gtrsim 10\;\mathrm{pc}$) or that a denser dusty

trapped atoms, with tails of ""hot"", untrapped atoms, and that this holds true
also for very shallow potentials. Careful analysis of the distribution of
high-momentum untrapped atoms, both from simulations and experiments, shows
that the tails of the distribution does not follow a normal law, hinting at a
power-law distribution and non-ergodic behavior. We also revisit the phenomenon
of d\'ecrochage, the potential depth below which the temperature of the atoms
starts increasing.

References updated",,"10.1016/j.aop.2016.03.006",,"quant-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In both quantum optics and cold atom physics, the behaviour of bosonic
photons and atoms is often treated using phase space methods, where mode
annihilation and creation operators are represented by c-number phase space
variables, with the density operator equivalent to a distribution function of
these variables. The anti-commutation rules for fermion annihilation, creation
operators suggests the possibility of using anti-commuting Grassmann variables
to represent these operators. However, in spite of the seminal work by Cahill
and Glauber and a few applications, the use of Grassmann phase space methods in
quantum - atom optics to treat fermionic systems is rather rare, though fermion
coherent states using Grassmann variables are widely used in particle physics.
  This paper presents a phase space theory for fermion systems based on
distribution functionals, which replace the density operator and involve
Grassmann fields representing anti-commuting fermion field annihilation,
creation operators. It is an extension of a previous phase space theory paper
for fermions (Paper I) based on separate modes, in which the density operator
is replaced by a distribution function depending on Grassmann phase space
variables which represent the mode annihilation and creation operators. This
further development of the theory is important for the situation when large
numbers of fermions are involved, resulting in too many modes to treat
separately. Here Grassmann fields, distribution functionals, functional
Fokker-Planck equations and Ito stochastic field equations are involved.
Typical applications to a trapped Fermi gas of interacting spin 1/2 fermionic
atoms and to multi-component Fermi gases with non-zero range interactions are
presented, showing that the Ito stochastic field equations are local in these
cases. Solutions for spin 1/2 fermions either free or in lattices are found.

nuclear rings or the barred structure of the galaxy. We provide evidence that
the traditional x1 orbital family does not always dominate in barred galaxy

support the barred structure. We also found that sparse enough nuclei, fast
rotating bars and high energy models can support the galactic bars. On the

energy models favor the formation of nuclear rings. We also compare our results

neural networks with reaction-diffusion terms and time-varying delays via
aperiodically intermittent pinning control is investigated. The coupling matrix
for the network can be asymmetric. Compared with state coupling in the
synchronization literature, we design a novel distributed coupling protocol by
using the reaction-diffusion coupling-spatial coupling, which can accelerate
the synchronization process. This can be regarded as the main difference
between this paper and previous works. Using the Lyapunov function and theories
in the aperiodically intermittent control, we present some criteria for the
complete synchronization with a static coupling strength. In this case, there
is no constraint on the bound of time-varying delays, so it can be larger than
the length of control span. On the other hand, for the network with an adaptive
coupling strength, we propose a simple adaptive rule for the coupling strength
and prove its effectiveness rigorously. In this case, the bound of time-varying
delay is required to be less than the infimum of the control time span.
Finally, numerical simulations are given to verify the theoretical results.

distribution was characterised by the normalised frequency distribution of the
quantity $\delta$ (the distance between the major flare and its precursor flare
normalised by the sunspot group diameter) in four 6-hour time intervals before
the major event. The precursors of X-class flares have a double-peaked spatial

focused on biochemical interaction systems that satisfy an ""absolute
concentration robustness"" (ACR) property. The ACR property was first discovered
experimentally when, in a number of different systems, the concentrations of
key system components at equilibrium were observed to be robust to the total
concentration levels of the system. Followup mathematical work focused on
deterministic models of biochemical systems and demonstrated how chemical
reaction network theory can be utilized to explain this robustness. Later
mathematical work focused on the behavior of this same class of reaction
networks, though under the assumption that the dynamics were stochastic. Under
the stochastic assumption, it was proven that the system will undergo an
extinction event with a probability of one so long as the system is
conservative, showing starkly different long-time behavior than in the
deterministic setting. Here we consider a general class of stochastic models
that intersects with the class of ACR systems studied previously. We consider a
specific system scaling over compact time intervals and prove that in a limit
of this scaling the distribution of the abundances of the ACR species converges
to a certain product-form Poisson distribution whose mean is the ACR value of
the deterministic model. This result is in agreement with recent conjectures
pertaining to the behavior of ACR networks endowed with stochastic kinetics,
and helps to resolve the conflicting theoretical results pertaining to
deterministic and stochastic models in this setting.

wireless sensor network (WSN) in 2D. A widely used algorithm to localize a WSN
in 2D is trilateration, which runs in polynomial time. Trilateration uses three
distance measurements to localize a node. In some cases, the lack of
connectivity leads to a low percentage of localized nodes since a node's
position can be fixed using three distance measurements. We propose an
algorithm that finds the position of a node by using the absence of a distance
measurement in addition to a third distance measurement. If two nodes are not
able to sense each other, that means the distance between them is more than the
sensing range. Therefore, our algorithm checks if the possible positions of an
unlocalized node $u$ is inside the sensing range of a localized node $\ell$
that is not the neighbor of $u$. In such case, we eliminate one of the possible
positions.

light (VSL) signal from cosmological data. It comes as an upgrade of [1,2],
where it was argued that such signal could be detected at a single redshift
location only. Here, we show how it is possible to extract information on a VSL
signal on an extended redshift range. We use mock cosmological data from future
galaxy surveys (BOSS, DESI, \emph{WFirst-2.4} and SKA): the sound horizon at
decoupling imprinted in the clustering of galaxies (BAO) as an angular diameter
distance, and the expansion rate derived from those galaxies recognized as
cosmic chronometers. We find that, given the forecast sensitivities of such
surveys, a $\sim1\%$ VSL signal can be detected at $3\sigma$ confidence level
in the redshift interval $z \in [0.,1.55]$. Smaller signals $(\sim0.1\%)$ will
be hardly detected (even if some lower possibility for a $1\sigma$ detection is
still possible). Finally, we discuss the degeneration between a VSL signal and
a non-null spatial curvature; we show that, given present bounds on curvature,
any signal, if detected, can be attributed to a VSL signal with a very high
confidence. On the other hand, our method turns out to be useful even in the
classical scenario of a constant speed of light: in this case, the signal we
reconstruct can be totally ascribed to spatial curvature and, thus, we might
have a method to detect a $0.01$-order curvature in the same redhift range with

temporal scale which in turn implies the existence of maximally localized

to reach its maximal localization. Our results may trigger further theoretical

friction may depend on a large number of system and loading parameters,
including normal force, sliding velocity, shape of contacting bodies, surface
roughness and so on. It was argued earlier that the contact configuration is
determined more immediately through the indentation depth than the normal
force, and thus the indentation depth can be considered as one of ""robust
governing parameters"" of friction. Both models of friction of simple shapes and
fractal surfaces demonstrate that the coefficient of friction of elastomers
should be generally a function of dimensionless combinations of sliding
velocity, surface gradient, relaxation time and size of micro-contacts. The
relaxation time does depend only on temperature and the surface slope and the
size of micro contacts mostly on the indentation depth. Based on this general
structure of the law of friction, we propose a generalized master curve
procedure for elastomer friction where the significant governing parameter -
indentation depth (or normal force) was taken into account. Unlike the
generation of the classical master curve by horizontal shifting of dependence
""friction - logarithm of velocity"" for different temperatures, in the case of
various indentation depth the shifting in both horizontal and vertical
direction is required. We experimentally investigated coefficient of friction
of elastomer on sliding velocity for different indentation depths and
temperatures, and generated a master curve according to this hypothesis.

are still not fully understood. As a prototypical pLGIC, here we choose the
insect resistance to dieldrin (RDL) receptor, involved in the resistance to
insecticides, and investigate the binding of the neurotransmitter GABA to its
extracellular domain at the atomistic level. We achieve this by means of
$\mu$-sec funnel-metadynamics simulations, which efficiently enhance the
sampling of bound and unbound states by using a funnel-shaped restraining
potential to limit the exploration in the solvent. We reveal the sequence of
events in the binding process, from the capture of GABA from the solvent to its
pinning between the charged residues Arg111 and Glu204 in the binding pocket.
We characterize the associated free energy landscapes in the wild-type RDL
receptor and in two mutant forms, where the key residues Arg111 and Glu204 are
mutated to Ala. Experimentally these mutations produce non-functional channels,
which is reflected in the reduced ligand binding affinities, due to the loss of
essential interactions. We also analyze the dynamical behaviour of the crucial
loop C, whose opening allows the access of GABA to the binding site, while its
closure locks the ligand into the protein. The RDL receptor shares structural
and functional features with other pLGICs, hence our work outlines a valuable
protocol to study the binding of ligands to pLGICs beyond conventional docking

Reciprocity relations follow from symmetries with respect to time reversal. The
kinetic coefficients can be split into a classical and a quantum contribution

condition. This constraint implies universal bounds on efficiency and power of
quantum heat engines. In particular, we show that Carnot efficiency can not be

Unsurprisingly, the linear-time model checking problem of DMS against MSO-FO is

two-variable time series containing vertex properties in the context of complex
networks. Time series of such observables are obtained by means of stationary,
unbiased random walks. We consider three vertex properties that provide,
respectively, short, medium, and long-range information regarding the
topological role of vertices in a given network. In order to reveal the
relation between these quantities, we applied the multifractal
cross-correlation analysis technique, which provides information about the
nonlinear effects in coupling of time series. We show that the considered
network models are characterized by unique multifractal properties of the
cross-correlation. In particular, it is possible to distinguish between
Erd\""{o}s-R\'{e}nyi, Barab\'{a}si-Albert, and Watts-Strogatz networks on the
basis of fractal cross-correlation. Moreover, the analysis of protein contact
networks reveals characteristics shared with both scale-free and small-world
models.

of monsoons to local and remote forcings: the vertically integrated atmospheric
energy budget and convective quasi-equilibrium (CQE). Existing forms of these
frameworks neglect some of the complexities of monsoons, such as the shallow
meridional circulations that advect dry air from adjacent deserts into the
middle and lower troposphere of monsoon regions. Here the fidelity of energy
budget and CQE theories for monsoon location is assessed in a three-dimensional
beta-plane model with boundary conditions representative of an off-equatorial
continent with a tropical grassland and an adjacent subtropical desert. Energy
budget theories show mixed success for various SST and land surface albedo
forcings, with the ITCZ being collocated with the energy flux equator but a
non-monotonic relationship existing between ITCZ latitude and cross-equatorial
energy transport. Accounting for the off-equatorial position of the unperturbed
energy flux equator is shown to be important when a linearization of meridional
energy transports is used to quantitatively diagnose ITCZ location. CQE
theories that diagnose ITCZ location based on the subcloud moist static energy
maximum are shown to have large biases; accounting for convective entrainment
of dry air by using a lower-tropospheric mean moist static energy provides a
more correct diagnosis of ITCZ location. Finally, it is shown that although
ITCZ shifts can be diagnosed by modified CQE and energy budget frameworks,
neither can be used in a quantitatively prognostic capacity due to
unpredictable feedbacks that are often larger than the imposed forcing.

transitions between regimes, the minimum bridge radius is resolved through four

early stage Impaired Glucose Regulation (IGR), has attracted much attention
recently. Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) [3], [5] etc. has proved that
tongue, face and sublingual diagnosis as a noninvasive method is a reasonable
way for disease detection. However, most previous works only focus on a single
modality (tongue, face or sublingual) for diagnosis, although different
modalities may provide complementary information for the diagnosis of DM and
IGR. In this paper, we propose a novel multi-modal classification method to
discriminate between DM (or IGR) and healthy controls. Specially, the tongue,
facial and sublingual images are first collected by using a non-invasive
capture device. The color, texture and geometry features of these three types
of images are then extracted, respectively. Finally, our so-called multi-modal
similar and specific learning (MMSSL) approach is proposed to combine features
of tongue, face and sublingual, which not only exploits the correlation but
also extracts individual components among them. Experimental results on a
dataset consisting of 192 Healthy, 198 DM and 114 IGR samples (all samples were
obtained from Guangdong Provincial Hospital of Traditional Chinese Medicine)
substantiate the effectiveness and superiority of our proposed method for the
diagnosis of DM and IGR, compared to the case of using a single modality.

regards to near-Earth objects (NEOs) using the project's current baseline
cadence. The survey shows that if the project is able to reliably generate
linked sets of positions and times (a so-called ""tracklet"") using two
detections of a given object per night and can link these tracklets into a
track with a minimum of 3 tracklets covering more than a ~12 day length-of-arc,
they would be able to discover 62% of the potentially hazardous asteroids
(PHAs) larger than 140 m in its projected 10 year survey lifetime. This
completeness would be reduced to 58% if the project is unable to implement a
pipeline using the two detection cadence and has to adopt the four detection
cadence more commonly used by existing NEO surveys. When including the
estimated performance from the current operating surveys, assuming these would
continue running until the start of LSST and perhaps beyond, the completeness
fraction for PHAs larger than 140m would be 73% for the baseline cadence and
71% for the four detection cadence. This result is a lower than the estimate of
Ivezic et al. (2007,2014); however it is comparable to that of Jones et al.
(2016) who show completeness ~70$%. We also show that the traditional method of
using absolute magnitude H < 22 mag as a proxy for the population with
diameters larger than 140m results in completeness values that are too high by
~5%. Our simulation makes use of the most recent models of the physical and
orbital properties of the NEO populations, as well as simulated cadences and
telescope performance estimates provided by LSST. We further show that while
neither LSST nor a space-based IR platform like NEOCam individually can
complete the survey for 140m diameter NEOs, the combination of these systems
can achieve that goal after a decade of observation.

undergraduates declaring a computing major at Ph.D. granting departments in the
US has increased 60% from 2011-2014 and the number of degrees granted has
increased by 34% from 2008-2013. However, this growth is not limited to higher
education. New York City, San Francisco and Oakland public schools will soon be
offering computer science to all students at all schools from preschool to 12th
grade, although it will be an elective for high school students. This
unprecedented demand means that CS departments are likely to teach not only
more students in the coming decades, but more diverse students, with more
varied backgrounds, motivations, preparations, and abilities.
  This growth is an unparalleled opportunity to expand the reach of computing
education. However, this growth is also a unique research challenge, as we know
very little about how best to teach our current students, let alone the
students soon to arrive. The burgeoning field of Computing Education Research
(CER) is positioned to address this challenge by answering research questions
such as, how should we teach computer science, from programming to advanced
principles, to a broader and more diverse audience? We argue that computer
science departments should lead the way in establishing CER as a foundational
research area of computer science, discovering the best ways to teach CS, and
inventing the best technologies with which to teach it. This white paper
provides a snapshot of the current state of CER and makes actionable
recommendations for academic leaders to grow CER as a successful research area

each of its constituent communities. Our community detection algorithm is based
on maximizing the GenPerm over all the vertices in the network. We demonstrate,
through experiments over synthetic and real-world networks, that GenPerm is
more effective than other metrics in evaluating community structure. Further,
we show that due to its vertex-centric property, GenPerm can be used to unfold
several inferences beyond community detection, such as core-periphery analysis

continuum is intrinsic, as assumed by Yan et al. 2015, it fails by a factor of
about 100 in powering the observed strength of the near-infrared emission
lines, and the thermal near and mid-infrared continuum. In contrast, the line
and continuum strengths are typical for a reddened AGN spectral energy
distribution. We find that the HeI*/Pbeta ratio is sensitive to the spectral
energy distribution for a one-zone model. If this sensitivity is maintained in
general broad-line region models, then this ratio may prove a useful diagnostic
for heavily reddened quasars. Analysis of archival HST STIS and FOC data
revealed evidence that the far-UV continuum emission is resolved on size scales
of ~40 parsecs. The lack of broad absorption lines in the far-UV continuum
might be explained if it were not coincident with the central engine. One
possibility is that it is the central engine continuum reflected from the

(3-2) lines. This bipolar outflow is along a north-west to south-east direction
with a line-of-sight flow velocity of about 3 km~s$^{-1}$ and is spatially
connected to the high-velocity jet-like outflows. It seems to be a collection
of low-velocity material entrained by the high-velocity outflows due to
momentum feedback. The total ejected mass and mass loss rate due to both high
velocity jet-like outflows and the ""EWBO"" are $\sim$24.5 M$_{\sun}$ and
$\sim1.7\times10^{-3}$ M$_{\sun}$~yr$^{-1}$, respectively. Global collapse of
the clump is revealed by the ""blue profile"" in the HCO$^{+}$ (1-0) line. A
hierarchical network of filaments was identified in NH$_{3}$ (1,1) emission.
Clear velocity gradients of the order of 10 km~s$^{-1}$~pc$^{-1}$ are found
along filaments, indicating gas inflow along the filaments. The sum of the
accretion rate along filaments and mass infall rate along the line of sight is
$\sim$3.1$\times10^{-3}$ M$_{\sun}$~yr$^{-1}$, which exceeds the total mass
loss rate, indicating that the central cluster is probably still gaining mass.
The central cluster is highly fragmented and 22 condensations are identified in
1.1 mm continuum emission. The fragmentation process seems to be determined by
thermal pressure and turbulence. The magnetic field may not play an important
role in fragmentation.

intercommunicated and what leading factor could be shaping the evolution of the
knowledge translation process for this disease. Methodology: A combination of
citation network analysis; analysis of Medical heading Subject (MeSH) and Gene
Ontology (GO) terms, and quantitative content analysis for patents and
scientific literature, aimed to map the organization of Ebola research was
carried out. Results: We found six putative research fronts (i.e. clusters of
high interconnected papers). Three research fronts are basic research on Ebola
virus structural proteins: glycoprotein, VP40 and VP35, respectively. There is
a fourth research front of basic research papers on pathogenesis, which is the
organizing hub of Ebola research. A fifth research front is pre-clinical
research focused on vaccines and glycoproteins. Finally, a
clinical-epidemiology research front related to the disease outbreaks was
identified. The network structure of patent families shows that the dominant
design is the use of Ebola virus proteins as targets of vaccines and other
immunological treatments. Therefore, patents network organization resembles the
organization of the scientific literature. Specifically, the knowledge on Ebola
would flow from higher (clinical-epidemiology) to intermediated
(cellular-tissular pathogenesis) to lower (molecular interactions) levels of
organization. Conclusion: Our results suggest a strong reductionist approach
for Ebola research probably influenced by the lethality of the disease. On the
other hand, the ownership profile of the patent families network and the main
researches relationship with the United State Army suggest a strong involvement
of this military institution in Ebola research.
