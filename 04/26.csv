single front-facing camera directly to steering commands. This end-to-end
approach proved surprisingly powerful. With minimum training data from humans
the system learns to drive in traffic on local roads with or without lane
markings and on highways. It also operates in areas with unclear visual
guidance such as in parking lots and on unpaved roads.
  The system automatically learns internal representations of the necessary
processing steps such as detecting useful road features with only the human
steering angle as the training signal. We never explicitly trained it to
detect, for example, the outline of roads.
  Compared to explicit decomposition of the problem, such as lane marking
detection, path planning, and control, our end-to-end system optimizes all
processing steps simultaneously. We argue that this will eventually lead to
better performance and smaller systems. Better performance will result because
the internal components self-optimize to maximize overall system performance,
instead of optimizing human-selected intermediate criteria, e.g., lane
detection. Such criteria understandably are selected for ease of human
interpretation which doesn't automatically guarantee maximum system
performance. Smaller networks are possible because the system learns to solve
the problem with the minimal number of processing steps.
  We used an NVIDIA DevBox and Torch 7 for training and an NVIDIA DRIVE(TM) PX
self-driving car computer also running Torch 7 for determining where to drive.
The system operates at 30 frames per second (FPS).

dependency between the data and class labels is maximized. This maximization is
performed using Hilbert-Schmidt independence criterion (HSIC). On the other
hand, the global distribution of the underlying manifolds were learned from the
unlabeled data by minimizing the distances between the unlabeled data and the
corresponding nearest labeled data in the space of the dictionary learned. The
proposed SS-DLSR algorithm has closed-form solutions for both the dictionary
and sparse coefficients, and therefore does not have to learn the two
iteratively and alternately as is common in the literature of the DLSR. This
makes the solution for the proposed algorithm very fast. The experiments
confirm the improvement in classification performance on benchmark datasets by
including the information from both labeled and unlabeled data, particularly
when there are many unlabeled data.

varying the thickness of the ultrathin layer, not the laser properties. This is
shown from numerical solutions of the time-dependent Schr\""odinger equation for

keeping the laser intensity low and the wavelength in the near-infrared range.
Furthermore, the degree of control that can be achieved in this way is much
higher than by varying the laser intensity. The origin of this behavior is the
reduction of electronic ""friction"" when moving from the essentially discrete

giant planets and that frequently perform close gravitational encounters with
these planets, which leads to a chaotic orbital evolution. Recently, the
discovery of two well-defined narrow rings was announced around the Centaur
10199 Chariklo. The rings are assumed to be in the equatorial plane of Chariklo
and to have circular orbits. The existence a well-defined system of rings
around a body in such perturbed orbital region poses an interesting new
problem. Are the rings of Chariklo stable when perturbed by close gravitational
encounters with the giant planets? Our approach to address this question
consisted of forward and backward numerical simulations of 729 clones of
Chariklo, with similar initial orbits, for a period of 100 Myrs. We found, on
average, that each clone suffers along its lifetime more than 150 close
encounters with the giant planets within one Hill radius of the planet in
question. We identified some extreme close encounters able to significantly
disrupt or to disturb the rings of Chariklo. About 3% of the clones lose the
rings and about 4% of the clones have the ring significantly disturbed.
Therefore, our results show that in most of the cases (more than 90%) the close
encounters with the giant planets do not affect the stability of the rings in
Chariklo-like systems. Thus, if there is an efficient mechanism that creates
the rings, then these structures may be common among these kinds of Centaurs.

converging in a reconnection region can be accelerated by the first order Fermi

spectral index of accelerated particles is related to the total plasma
compression within the reconnection region similarly to the case of diffusive
shock acceleration mechanism. As a first step to investigate the efficiency of
Fermi acceleration in reconnection regions in producing hard energy spectra of
particles in the solar corona, we explore the degree of plasma compression that
can be achieved at reconnection sites. In particular, we aim to determine the
conditions for the strong compressions to form. Using a two-dimensional
resistive MHD numerical model we consider a set of magnetic field
configurations where magnetic reconnection can occur including a Harris current
sheet, a force-free current sheet, and two merging flux ropes. Plasma
parameters are taken to be characteristic of the solar corona. Numerical
simulations show that strong plasma compressions ($\geq 4$) in the reconnection
regions can form when the plasma heating due to reconnection is efficiently
removed by fast thermal conduction or radiative cooling process. The radiative
cooling process which is negligible in the typical 1 MK corona can play an
important role in the low corona/transition region. It is found that plasma
compression is expected to be strongest in low-beta plasma $\beta \sim

dynamo models require the toroidal magnetic flux to be stored in a region of
low magnetic diffusivity, typically located at or below the bottom of the
convection zone.
  We infer the turbulent magnetic diffusivity affecting the toroidal field on
the basis of empirical data.
  We consider the time evolution of mean latitude and width of the activity
belts of solar cycles 12--23 and their dependence on cycle strength. We
interpret the decline phase of the cycles as a diffusion process.
  The activity level of a given cycle begins to decline when the centers of its
equatorward propagating activity belts come within their width (at half
maximum) from the equator. This happens earlier for stronger cycles because
their activity belts are wider. From that moment on, the activity and the belt
width decrease in the same manner for all cycles, independent of their maximum
activity level. In terms of diffusive cancellation of opposite-polarity
toroidal flux across the equator, we infer the turbulent diffusivity
experienced by the toroidal field, wherever it is located, to be in the range
150--450~km$^2$s$^{-1}$. Strong diffusive latitudinal spreading of the toroidal
flux underneath the activity belts can be inhibited by an inflow towards the
toroidal field bands in the convection zone with a magnitude of several meters
per second.
  The inferred value of the turbulent magnetic diffusivity affecting the
toroidal field agrees, to order of magnitude, with estimates based on
mixing-length models for the solar convection zone. This is at variance with
the requirement of flux-transport dynamo models. The inflows required to keep
the toroidal field bands together before they approach the equator are similar
to the inflows towards the activity belts observed with local helioseismology.

show filament-surface interactions lead to a host of non-uniform shape
equilibria, in which filaments progressively unwind from their native twist
with increasing surface interaction and surface curvature, ultimately adopting
uniform-contact curved shapes. The latter effect is due to non-linear coupling
between elastic twist and bending of filaments on anisotropically-curved
surfaces, such as the cylindrical surfaces considered here. Via a combination
of numerical solutions and asymptotic analysis of shape equilibria we show that
filament conformations are critically sensitive to the surface curvature in
both the strong- and weak-binding limits. These results suggest that local
structure of membrane-bound chiral filaments is generically sensitive to the
curvature-radius of the surface to which it is bound, even when that radius is
much larger than the filament intrinsic pitch. Typical values of elastic
parameters and interaction energies for several prokaryotic and eukaryotic
filaments indicate that biopolymers are inherently very sensitive to the
coupling between twist, interactions and geometry and that this could be
exploited for regulation of a variety of processes such as the targeted
exertion of forces, signaling and self-assembly in response to geometric cues

possibility of a gravitational seesaw mechanism, in which several dimensional
parameters of the same order of magnitude produce a hierarchy in the masses of

freedom detectable in low-energy laboratory and astrophysical observations,
such as torsion balance experiments and the bending of light. We demonstrate
that such a seesaw mechanism in the six- and more-derivative theories is unable
to reduce the lightest mass more than in the simplest four-derivative model.
Adding more derivatives to the four-derivative action of gravity makes heavier
masses even greater, while the lightest massive ghost is not strongly affected.
This fact is favorable for protecting the theory from instabilities, but makes
the experimental detection of higher derivatives more difficult.

produce a function $f \colon X \to Y$ with certain properties, where $X$ is
some underlying combinatorial structure and $Y$ is a (typically finite) set.
Can this function $f$ be chosen to be Borel or $\mu$-measurable for some
probability Borel measure $\mu$ on $X$ (assuming that $X$ is a standard Borel
space)? In the positive direction, we prove that if the set of constraints put
on $f$ is, in a certain sense, ""locally finite,"" then there is always a Borel
choice for $f$ that is ""$\varepsilon$-close"" to satisfying these constraints,
for any $\varepsilon > 0$. Moreover, if the combinatorial structure on $X$ is
""induced"" by the $[0;1]$-shift action of a countable group $\Gamma$, then, even
without any local finiteness assumptions, there is a Borel choice for $f$ which
satisfies the constraints on an invariant conull set (i.e., with $\varepsilon =
0$). A direct corollary of our results is an upper bound on the measurable
chromatic number of the graph $G_n$ generated by the shift action of the free
group $\mathbb{F}_n$ that is asymptotically tight up to a factor of at most $2$
(which answers a question of Lyons and Nazarov). On the other hand, our result
for structures induced by measure-preserving group actions is, at least for
amenable groups, sharp in the following sense: a probability measure-preserving
action of a countably infinite amenable group satisfies the measurable version
of the Lov\'asz Local Lemma if and only if it admits a factor map to the
$[0;1]$-shift action. To prove this, we combine the tools of the
Ornstein--Weiss theory of entropy for actions of amenable groups with concepts
from computability theory, specifically, Kolmogorov complexity.

supremum of Hilbert Schmidt independence criterion-Sure independence screening
(sup-HSIC-SIS, for short) developed by Balasubramanian et al. [2013], KCCA-SIS
is scale free removing the marginal variation of features and response
variables. No model assumption is needed between response and predictors to
apply KCCA-SIS and it can be used in ultrahigh dimensional data analysis.
Similar to DC-SIS and sup- HSIC-SIS, KCCA-SIS can also be used directly to
screen grouped predictors and for multivariate response variables. We show that
KCCA-SIS has the sure screening prop- erty, and has better performance through
simulation studies. We applied KCCA-SIS to study Autism genes in a

effective theory with new physics theoretically motivated to be around TeV
scale. The dissertation presents theories with new physics beyond the Standard
Model at the TeV scale testable in the current High Energy Colliders. The study
on leptoquarks gauge bosons in reference to TopSU(5) model in chapter 2 showed
that their discovery mass range extends upto 1.5 TeV at 14 TeV LHC with
luminosity of 100 $fb^{-1}$. On the other hand, in chapter 3 we studied the
collider phenomenology of TeV scale mirror fermions in Left-Right Mirror model
finding that the reaches for the mirror quarks goes upto $750$ GeV at the $14$
TeV LHC with $~300 ~fb^{-1}$ luminosity. In chapter 4 we have enlarged the
bosonic symmetry to fermi-bose symmetry e.g. supersymmetry and have shown that
SUSY with non-universalities in gaugino or scalar masses within high scale
SUGRA set up can still be accessible at LHC with 14 TeV. In chapter 5, we
performed a study in respect to the $e^+e^-$ collider and find that precise
measurements of the higgs boson mass splittings upto $\sim 100$ MeV may be
possible with high luminosity in the International Linear Collider (ILC). In
chapter 6 we have shown that the experimental data on neutrino masses and
mixings are consistent with the proposed 4/5 parameter Dirac neutrino models
yielding a solution for the neutrino masses with inverted mass hierarchy and
large CP violating phase $\delta$ and thus can be tested experimentally.
Chapter 7 incorporates a warm dark matter candidate in context of two Higgs
doublet model. The model has several testable consequences at LHC. This
dissertation presents an endeavor to study beyond standard model (BSM) physics
at the TeV scale with testable signals in the Colliders.

nearby spiral galaxy IC 342 is contributed by PDRs and by the ionized gas. We
examine the spatial variations of starburst/PDR activity and study the
correlation of the [CII] line with the [NII] 205{\textmu}m emission line coming
exclusively from the HII regions. Methods: We present small maps of [CII] and
[NII] lines recently observed with the GREAT receiver on board SOFIA. In
particular we present a super-resolution method to derive how unresolved,
kinematically correlated structures in the beam contribute to the observed line
shapes. Results: We find that the emission coming from the ionized gas shows a
kinematic component in addition to the general Doppler signature of the
molecular gas. We interpret this as the signature of two bi-polar lobes of
ionized gas expanding out of the galactic plane. We then show how this requires
an adaptation of our understanding of the geometrical structure of the nucleus
of IC~342. Examining the starburst activity we find ratios
$I([CII])/I(^{12}\mathrm{CO} (1-0))$ between 400 and 1800 in energy units.
Applying predictions from numerical models of HII and PDR regions to derive the
contribution from the ionized phase to the total [CII] emission we find that
35-90% of the observed [CII] intensity stems from the ionized gas if both
phases contribute. Averaged over the central few hundred parsec we find for the
[CII] contribution a HII-to-PDR ratio of 70:30. Conclusions: The ionized gas in
the center of IC 342 contributes more strongly to the overall [CII] emission
than is commonly observed on larger scales and than is predicted. Kinematic
analysis shows that the majority of the [CII] emission is related to the strong
but embedded star formation in the nuclear molecular ring and only marginally
emitted from the expanding bi-polar lobes of ionized gas.

conflict between air traffic within a block of airspace. Autonomous
Sense-and-Avoid is an essential safety feature to enable Unmanned Air Systems
to operate alongside other (manned or unmanned) air traffic. The ability to
estimate probability of conflict between traffic is an essential part of
Sense-and-Avoid. Such probabilities are typically very low. Evaluating low
probabilities using naive Direct Monte Carlo generates a significant
computational load. This paper applies a technique called Subset Simulation.
The small failure probabilities are computed as a product of larger conditional
failure probabilities, reducing the computational load whilst improving the
accuracy of the probability estimates. The reduction in the number of samples
required can be one or more orders of magnitude. The utility of the approach is
demonstrated by modeling a series of conflicting and potentially conflicting

out by Baldwin et al. (1996), who termed it the ""Si II disaster"", and it has
remained unresolved. We investigate the problem in the light of newly-published
atomic data for Si II. Specifically, we perform broad line region calculations
using several different atomic datasets within the CLOUDY modeling code under
optically thick quasar cloud conditions. In addition, we test for selective
pumping by the source photons or intrinsic galactic reddening as possible
causes for the discrepancy, and also consider blending with other species.
However, we find that none of the options investigated resolves the Si II
disaster, with the potential exception of microturbulent velocity broadening
and line blending. We find that a larger microturbulent velocity ($\sim 500 \rm
\, kms^{-1}$) may solve the Si II disaster through continuum pumping and other
effects. The CLOUDY models indicate strong blending of the Si II 1307 \AA\
multiplet with emission lines of O I, although the predicted degree of blending
is incompatible with the observed 1263/1307 intensity ratios. Clearly, more
work is required on the quasar modelling of not just the Si II lines but also
nearby transitions (in particular those of O I) to fully investigate if

is advisable to use as original an appropriate subspace of complete Hilbert
space of states and respectively to utilize observables acting only in this

of a pure states set, as a rule, is simpler by far than in general case.
Moreover in such SQWs some specific irreducible entangled states may appear.
The similar states could be very helpful in various tasks connected with

many different types of hyperelastic materials. Previous methods such as
Position Based or Projective Dynamics are fast, but support only limited
selection of materials; even classical materials such as the Neo-Hookean
elasticity are not supported. Recently, Xu et al. [2015] introduced new
""spline-based materials"" which can be easily controlled by artists to achieve
desired animation effects. Simulation of these types of materials currently
relies on Newton's method, which is slow, even with only one iteration per
timestep. In this paper, we show that Projective Dynamics can be interpreted as
a quasi-Newton method. This insight enables very efficient simulation of a
large class of hyperelastic materials, including the Neo-Hookean, spline-based
materials, and others. The quasi-Newton interpretation also allows us to
leverage ideas from numerical optimization. In particular, we show that our
solver can be further accelerated using L-BFGS updates (Limited-memory
Broyden-Fletcher-Goldfarb-Shanno algorithm). Our final method is typically more
than 10 times faster than one iteration of Newton's method without compromising
quality. In fact, our result is often more accurate than the result obtained
with one iteration of Newton's method. Our method is also easier to implement,
implying reduced software development costs.

standard pixel-wise reconstruction loss, as well as a reconstruction plus an

better handle multiple modes in the output. We found that a context encoder
learns a representation that captures not just appearance but also the
semantics of visual structures. We quantitatively demonstrate the effectiveness
of our learned features for CNN pre-training on classification, detection, and

paper, we propose a new achievability scheme for the weak and the moderately

confidentiality of the transmitted messages are maintained at any finite SNR
value. Our scheme uses lattice structure, structured jamming codewords, and
lattice alignment in the encoding and the asymmetric compute-and-forward
strategy in the decoding. We show that our lower bound on the sum secure rates
scales linearly with log(SNR) and hence, it outperforms i.i.d. Gaussian random

reproduce the mass splitting of azimuthal anisotropy ($v_n$) at low transverse

however, $v_n$ is mainly generated by the parton escape mechanism, not by the
hydrodynamic flow. In this study we provide detailed results on the mass
splitting of $v_n$ in this transport model, including $v_2$ and $v_3$ of
various hadron species in d+Au and Au+Au collisions at the Relativistic Heavy

mass splitting of hadron $v_2$ and $v_3$ in AMPT first arises from the
kinematics in the quark coalescence hadronization process, and then, more
dominantly, comes from hadronic rescatterings, even though the contribution
from the latter to the overall charged hadron $v_n$ is small. We further show
that there is no qualitative difference between heavy ion collisions and
small-system collisions or between elliptic ($v_2$) and triangular ($v_3$)
anisotropies. Our studies thus demonstrate that the mass splitting of $v_2$ and
$v_3$ at low-$p_{\perp}$ is not a unique signature of hydrodynamic collective
flow but can be the interplay of several physics effects.

sulfur particles, whilst in the warmer models S$_8$ remains a vapor along with
several other sulfur allotropes that are both visually striking and potentially
observable. For 51 Eri b, the division between models with and without
condensed sulfur is at an effective temperature of 700 K, which is within error
its actual effective temperature; the local temperature where sulfur condenses

account for diffusive shock acceleration of CRs at resolved shocks and at
supernova remnants in the interstellar medium (ISM), and follow the advective
CR transport within the magnetised plasma, as well as anisotropic diffusive
transport of CRs along the local magnetic field. CR losses are included in
terms of Coulomb and hadronic interactions with the thermal plasma. We
demonstrate the accuracy of our formalism for CR acceleration at shocks through
simulations of plane-parallel shock tubes that are compared to newly derived
exact solutions of the Riemann shock tube problem with CR acceleration. We find
that the increased compressibility of the post-shock plasma due to the produced
CRs decreases the shock speed. However, CR acceleration at spherically
expanding blast waves does not significantly break the self-similarity of the
Sedov-Taylor solution; the resulting modifications can be approximated by a
suitably adjusted, but constant adiabatic index. In first applications of the
new CR formalism to simulations of isolated galaxies and cosmic structure
formation, we find that CRs add an important pressure component to the ISM that
increases the vertical scale height of disk galaxies, and thus reduces the star
formation rate. Strong external structure formation shocks inject CRs into the
gas, but the relative pressure of this component decreases towards halo centres
as adiabatic compression favours the thermal over the CR pressure.

work, we identify and analyse shocks in the Illustris simulation, and contrast
the results with those of non-radiative runs. We show that simulations with
more comprehensive physical models of galaxy formation pose new challenges for
shock finding algorithms due to radiative cooling and star-forming processes,
prompting us to develop a number of methodology improvements. We find in
Illustris a total shock surface area which is about 1.4 times larger at the
present epoch compared to non-radiative runs, and an energy dissipation rate at
shocks which is higher by a factor of around 7. Remarkably, shocks with Mach
numbers above and below $\mathcal{M}\approx10$ contribute about equally to the
total dissipation across cosmic time. This is in sharp contrast to
non-radiative simulations, and we demonstrate that a large part of the
difference arises due to strong black hole radio-mode feedback in Illustris. We
also provide an overview of the large diversity of shock morphologies, which
includes complex networks of halo-internal shocks, shocks on to cosmic sheets,
feedback shocks due to black holes and galactic winds, as well as ubiquitous
accretion shocks. In high redshift systems more massive than
$10^{12}\,\mathrm{M}_\odot$ we discover the existence of a double accretion
shock pattern in haloes. They are created when gas streams along filaments

transfer on a suite of hydrodynamical simulations of galaxies. Our suite
includes both isolated disk galaxies and mergers intended to be representative
of galaxies at both $z \sim 0$ and $z \sim 2-3$. Our low-redshift isolated
disks and mergers often populate a region around the the locally calibrated
\citet[][M99]{M99} relation but move well above the relation during
merger-induced starbursts. Our high-redshift simulated galaxies are blue and
IR-luminous, which makes them lie above the M99 relation. The value of UV
continuum slope strongly depends on the dust type used in the radiative
transfer calculations: Milky Way-type dust leads to significantly more negative
(bluer) slopes compared with Small Magellanic Cloud-type dust. The effect on
$\beta$ due to variations in the dust composition with galaxy properties or
redshift can dominate over other sources of $\beta$ variations and is the
dominant model uncertainty. The dispersion in $\beta$ is anticorrelated with
specific star formation rate and tends to be higher for the $z \sim 2-3$
simulations. In the actively star-forming $z \sim 2-3$ simulated galaxies, dust
attenuation dominates the dispersion in $\beta$, whereas in the $z \sim 0$
simulations, the contributions of SFH variations and dust are similar. For
low-SSFR systems at both redshifts, SFH variations dominate the dispersion.
Finally, the simulated $z \sim 2-3$ isolated disks and mergers both occupy a
region in the \irxbeta\ plane consistent with observed $z \sim 2-3$ dusty
star-forming galaxies (DSFGs). Thus, contrary to some claims in the literature,
the blue colors of high-z DSFGs do not imply that they are short-lived
starbursts.

187 systems (some with multiple components) and 440 disks with only upper
limits (125 warm and 315 cold), around a total of 360 systems. The disk dust
masses at a common early evolutionary point in time were determined using our
numerical disk evolutionary code, evolving a unique model for each of the 662
disks backward to an age of 1 Myr. We find that disk-bearing stars seldom have
metallicities less than [Fe/H] = -0.2 and that the distribution of warm
component masses lacks examples with large mass around stars of low metallicity
([Fe/H] < -0.085). Previous efforts to find a correlation have been largely
unsuccessful; the primary improvements supporting our result are: 1.) basing
the study on dust masses, not just infrared excess detections; 2.) including
upper limits on dust mass in a quantitative way; 3.) accounting for the
evolution of debris disk excesses as systems age; 4.) accounting fully for the
range of uncertainties in metallicity measurements; and 5.) having a

with extended X-ray emission at $z_{spec} = 2.506$, which contains 11 massive
($M_{*} \gtrsim 10^{11} M_{\odot}$) galaxies in the central 80kpc region
(11.6$\sigma$ overdensity). We have spectroscopically confirmed 17 member
galaxies with 11 from CO and the remaining ones from $H\alpha$. The X-ray
luminosity, stellar mass content and velocity dispersion all point to a
collapsed, cluster-sized dark matter halo with mass $M_{200c} = 10^{13.9\pm0.2}
M_{\odot}$, making it the most distant X-ray-detected cluster known to date.
Unlike other clusters discovered so far, this structure is dominated by
star-forming galaxies (SFGs) in the core with only 2 out of the 11 massive
galaxies classified as quiescent. The star formation rate (SFR) in the 80kpc
core reaches $\sim$3400 $M_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$ with a gas depletion time of
$\sim 200$ Myr, suggesting that we caught this cluster in rapid build-up of a
dense core. The high SFR is driven by both a high abundance of SFGs and a
higher starburst fraction ($\sim25\%$, compared to 3\%-5\% in the field). The
presence of both a collapsed, cluster-sized halo and a predominant population
of massive SFGs suggests that this structure could represent an important
transition phase between protoclusters and mature clusters. It provides
evidence that the main phase of massive galaxy passivization will take place
after galaxies accrete onto the cluster, providing new insights into massive
cluster formation at early epochs. The large integrated stellar mass at such
high redshift challenges our understanding of massive cluster formation.

suggested that a small part of the radio flux can be attributed to the planet.
Here, we assume that this signal is real, and study if this radio emission
could be caused by lightning with similar energetic properties like in the
Solar system. We find that a lightning storm with 3.8 x $10^6$ times larger
flash densities than the Earth-storms with the largest lightning activity is
needed to produce the observed signal from HAT-P-11b. The optical emission of
such thunderstorm would be comparable to that of the host star. We show that
HCN produced by lightning chemistry is observable 2-3 yr after the storm, which
produces signatures in the L (3.0-4.0 \mu m) and N (7.5-14.5 \mu m) infrared

produced by lightning, however, future, combined radio and infrared
observations may lead to lightning detection on planets outside the Solar

injection of the disk wind is treated as a boundary condition in the equatorial
plane, and its evolution is followed by invoking a prescribed geometry of
streamlines. Solutions are obtained for a wide range of disk wind parameters.
It is found that jet collimation generally occurs when the total wind power
exceeds about ten percents of the jet power. For moderate wind powers we find
gradual collimation. For strong winds we find rapid collimation followed by
focusing of the jet, after which it remains narrow over many Alfv\'en crossing
times before becoming conical. We estimate that in the later case the jet's
magnetic field may be dissipated by the current-driven kink instability over a
distance of a few hundreds gravitational radii. We apply the model to M87 and
show that the observed parabolic shape of the radio jet within the Bondi radius
can be reproduced provided that the wind injection zone extends to several
hundreds gravitational radii, and that its total power is about one third of

standard disk-wind model or via geometric projection effects. We measure upper
limits to acceleration and deceleration for 76 additional BAL troughs and find
that the majority of BALs are stable to within about 3% of their mean

The thin disc in our numerical experiments initially has a tight negative

the radial mixing of stars drives a positive vertical metallicity gradient in
the thin disc. On the other hand, if the initial thin disc is flared, with
vertical scale-height increasing with galactocentric radius, the metal poor
stars originally in the outer disc become dominant in regions above the disc

gradient, which is consistent with the current observed trend. This model
mimics a scenario where the star-forming thin disc was flared in the outer
region at earlier epochs. Our numerical experiment with an initial flared disc
predicts that the negative vertical metallicity gradient of the mono-age
relatively young thin disc population should be steeper in the inner disc, and
the radial metallicity gradient of the mono-age population should be shallower
at greater heights above the disc plane. We also predict that the metallicity

mergers and stellar stripping, is to force the model to match the observed SMF
at redshift $z>2$, and let it evolve down to the present time according to the
observed (SFR-$M_*$) relation. In this study, we use two different sets of SMFs
and two SFR-$M_*$ relations: a simple power law and a relation with a
mass-dependent slope. Our analysis shows that the evolution of the SMF is more
consistent with a SFR-$M_*$ relation with a mass-dependent slope, in agreement
with predictions from other models of galaxy evolution and recent observations.
In order to fully and realistically describe the evolution of the SMF, both
mergers and stellar stripping must be considered, and we find that both have
almost equal effects on the evolution of SMF at the massive end. Taking into
account the systematic uncertainties in the observed data, the high-mass end of
the SMF obtained by considering stellar stripping results in good agreement
with recent observational data from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). At

ratio of the sound speed to the orbital speed at the injection point is

mass-loss (\epsilon < 0.15) from binaries with q < 0.06 or q > 0.8, the
equatorial outflow instead remains marginally-bound and falls back to the
binary over tens to hundreds of binary orbits, where it experiences additional
tidal torqueing and shocking. As the bound gas becomes virialized with the
binary, the luminosity of the system increases slowly at approximately constant
photosphere radius, causing the temperature to rise. Subsequent evolution
depends on the efficiency of radiative cooling. If the bound atmosphere is able
to cool efficiently, as quantified by radiative diffusion time being shorter
than the advection time (t_diff/t_adv < 1), then the virialized gas collapses
to an excretion disk, while for t_diff/t_adv > 1 an isotropic wind is formed.
Between these two extremes, an inflated envelope transports the heat generated
near the binary to the surface by meridional flows. In all cases, the radiated
luminosity reaches a fraction ~0.01 to 0.1 of Mdot v_orb^2/2, where Mdot is the
mass outflow rate. We discuss the implications of our results for transients in

produced through the grinding down by collisions of planetesimals,
kilometre-sized bodies in orbit around the star. In addition to dust, small
amounts of gas are also known to orbit the star, likely the result from
vaporisation of violently colliding dust grains. The disk is seen edge on and
from previous absorption spectroscopy we know that the gas is very rich in
carbon relative to other elements. The oxygen content has been more difficult
to assess, however, with early estimates finding very little oxygen in the gas
at a C/O ratio 20x higher than the cosmic value. A C/O ratio that high is
difficult to explain and would have far-reaching consequences for planet
formation. Here we report on observations by the far-infrared space telescope
Herschel, using PACS, of emission lines from ionised carbon and neutral oxygen.
The detected emission from C+ is consistent with that previously reported being
observed by the HIFI instrument on Herschel, while the emission from O is hard
to explain without assuming a higher-density region in the disk, perhaps in the
shape of a clump or a dense torus, required to sufficiently excite the O atoms.
A possible scenario is that the C/O gas is produced by the same process
responsible for the CO clump recently observed by ALMA in the disk, and that
the re-distribution of the gas takes longer than previously assumed. A more

complementarity with dijet and $lljj$ data, as well as neutrinoless double beta
decay. We keep the ratio of the left- and right-handed gauge coupling free in
order to take into account different patterns of left-right symmetry breaking.
By combining the dielectron and dimuon data we can exclude $Z^{\prime}$ masses
below $3$ TeV for $g_R=g_L$, and for $g_R \sim 1$ we rule out masses up to
$\sim 4$ TeV. Those comprise the strongest direct bounds on the $Z^{\prime}$
mass from left-right models up to date. We show that in the usual plane of
right-handed neutrino and charged gauge boson mass, dilepton data can probe a
region of parameter space inaccessible to neutrinoless double beta decay and
$lljj$ studies. Lastly, through the mass relation between $W_R$ and
$Z^{\prime}$ we present an indirect bound on the lifetime of neutrinoless

complex systems that include agents who are themselves using quantum theory.
Analysing the experiment under this presumption, we find that one agent, upon
observing a particular measurement outcome, must conclude that another agent

its cold temperature, the planet encounters significant methane condensation,

Surface reflection may be seen if the atmosphere is thin. Due to

identification which affects disease treatment and drug discovery. Many
researches have been done in this field. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS)
are one of them that focus on the identification of diseases-susceptible loci
on chromosomes. Recently, computational approaches, known as gene
prioritization methods have been used to identify candidate disease genes. Gene
prioritization methods integrate several data sources to discover and
prioritize the most probable candidate disease genes. In this paper, we propose
a prioritization method, called HybridRanker which is a network-based technique
and it also uses experimental data to identify candidate cancer genes. We apply
our proposed method on colorectal cancer data. It is notable to say that in
HybridRanker, for considering both local and global network information of a
protein-protein interaction network, different algorithms such as
shortest-path, random walk with restart and network propagation are exploited.
By using these algorithms, initial scores are given to genes within the
network. Furthermore, by looking through diseases with similar symptoms and
also comorbid diseases and by extracting their causing genes, the gene scores
are recalculated. We also use gene-phenotype relations for an additional
scoring of the candidate genes. Our method is validated and compared with other
prioritization methods in leave one-out cross-validation and the comparison
results show the better performance of the HybridRanker.

  Our main result is an approximate version of the conjecture: every Boolean

on the folklore bound of s/epsilon. Further, we show that improving the bound

deep Zeeman effect measurement of the 113 GHz CN (1-0) line towards this clump
with the IRAM 30 m telescope. We combine simultaneous fitting of all CN
hyperfines with Monte Carlo simulations for a large range in realization of the
magnetic field to obtain a constraint on the line-of-sight field strength of
-687 +/- 420 microG. We also analyze archival dust polarization observations
towards G35.20w. A strong magnetic field is implied by the remarkably ordered
field orientation that is perpendicular to the longest axis of the clump. Based
on this, we also estimate the plane-of-sky component of the magnetic field to
be ~740 microG. This allows for a unique comparison of the two orthogonal
measurements of magnetic field strength of the same region and at similar
spatial scales. The expected total field strength shows no significant conflict
between the observed field and that required for pressure equilibrium. By
producing a probability distribution for a large range in field geometries, we
show that plane-of-sky projections are much closer to the true field strengths

Zeeman measurements of magnetized structures, even with ALMA. We also show that

local interstellar medium (ISM) is about 90% of the primordial ratio predicted
by big bang nucleosynthesis. The high (D/H)$_{ISM}$ implies that only a small
fraction of interstellar gas has been processed through stars, which destroy
any deuterium they are born with. Using analytic arguments for one-zone
chemical evolution models that include accretion and outflow, I show that the
deuterium abundance is tightly coupled to the abundance of core collapse
supernova (CCSN) elements such as oxygen. These models predict that the ratio
of (D/H)$_{ISM}$ to the primordial abundance is $\approx 1/(1+r Z_O/m_O)$,
where r is the recycling fraction, $Z_O$ is the ISM oxygen mass fraction, and
$m_O$ is the population averaged CCSN yield of oxygen. Using values $r=0.4$ and
$m_O=0.015$ appropriate to a Kroupa (2001) initial mass function and recent
CCSN yield calculations, solar oxygen abundance corresponds to an ISM (D/H)
that is 87\% of the primordial value, consistent with observations. This
approximation is accurate for a wide range of parameter values, and physical
arguments suggest that it should remain accurate for more complex chemical
evolution models, making the deuterium abundance a robust prediction of almost
any model that reproduces the observed ISM metallicity. The good agreement with
the upper range of observed (D/H)$_{ISM}$ values supports the long-standing
suggestion that sightline-to-sightline variations of deuterium are a
consequence of dust depletion, rather than a low global (D/H)$_{ISM}$ enhanced
by localized accretion of primordial composition gas. This agreement limits
deviations from conventional yield and recycling values, and it implies that
Galactic outflows eject ISM hydrogen as efficiently as they eject CCSN metals.

evolution models and explore their implications. In contrast to existing
analytic models, we incorporate a realistic delay time distribution for Type Ia
supernovae (SNIa) and can therefore track the separate evolution of
$\alpha$-elements produced by core collapse supernovae (CCSNe) and iron peak
elements synthesized in both CCSNe and SNIa. In generic cases, $\alpha$ and
iron abundances evolve to an equilibrium at which element production is
balanced by metal consumption and gas dilution, instead of continuing to
increase over time. The equilibrium absolute abundances depend principally on
supernova yields and the outflow mass loading parameter $\eta$, while the
equilibrium abundance ratio [$\alpha$/Fe] depends mainly on yields and
secondarily on star formation history. A stellar population can be metal-poor
either because it has not yet evolved to equilibrium or because high outflow
efficiency makes the equilibrium abundance itself low. Systems with ongoing gas
accretion develop metallicity distribution functions (MDFs) that are sharply
peaked, while ""gas starved"" systems with rapidly declining star formation have
broadly peaked MDFs. A burst of star formation that consumes a significant
fraction of a system's available gas can temporarily boost [$\alpha$/Fe] by
0.1-0.3 dex, a possible origin for rare, $\alpha$-enhanced stars with
intermediate age or high metallicity. Other sudden transitions in system
properties can produce surprising behavior, including backward evolution of a
stellar population from high metallicity to low metallicity. An Appendix
provides a user's guide for calculating enrichment histories, [$\alpha$/Fe]
tracks, and MDFs for a wide variety of scenarios, including flexible forms of
star formation history.

due to their internal stresses. They are expected to naturally arise in tidal
disruption events, around Be stars, in mass-losing post main sequence binaries,
as a result of supernova fallback, etc. Their evolution is theoretically
understood in two regimes: when the central object does not exert torque on the
disk (a standard assumption for conventional accretion disks) or when no mass
inflow (or outflow) occurs at the disk center. However, many astrophysical
objects - circumbinary disks, Be stars, neutron stars accreting in a propeller
regime, etc. - feature non-zero torque simultaneously with the non-zero
accretion (or ejection of mass) at the disk center. We provide a general
description for the evolution of such disks (both linear and non-linear) in the
self-similar regime, to which the disk should asymptotically converge with
time. We identify a similarity parameter $\lambda$, which is uniquely related
to the degree, to which the central mass accretion is suppressed by the
non-zero central torque. The known decretion disk solutions correspond to the
two discrete values of $\lambda$, while our new solutions cover a continuum of
its physically allowed values, corresponding to either accretion or mass
ejection by the central object. A direct relationship between $\lambda$ and
central $\dot M$ and torque is also established. We describe the time evolution
of the various disk characteristics for different $\lambda$, and show that the
observable properties (spectrum and luminosity evolution) of the decretion

The M83 XLF has a steeper XLF than the X-ray binary XLF in NGC 253, consistent

dynamical processes --one for opinion formation and the other for decision
making-- on two interconnected networks $A$ and $B$. The opinion dynamics on
network $A$ corresponds to that of the M-model, where the state of each agent
can take one of four possible values ($S=-2,-1,1,2$), describing its level of
agreement on a given issue. The likelihood to become an extremist ($S=\pm 2$)
or a moderate ($S=\pm 1$) is controlled by a reinforcement parameter $r \ge 0$.
The decision making dynamics on network $B$ is akin to that of the
Abrams-Strogatz model, where agents can be either in favor ($S=+1$) or against
($S=-1$) the issue. The probability that an agent changes its state is
proportional to the fraction of neighbors that hold the opposite state raised
to a power $\beta$. Starting from a polarized case scenario in which all agents
of network $A$ hold positive orientations while all agents of network $B$ have
a negative orientation, we explore the conditions under which one of the
dynamics prevails over the other, imposing its initial orientation. We find
that, for a given value of $\beta$, the two-network system reaches a consensus
in the positive state (initial state of network $A$) when the reinforcement
overcomes a crossover value $r^*(\beta)$, while a negative consensus happens
for $r<r^*(\beta)$. In the $r-\beta$ phase space, the system displays a
transition at a critical threshold $\beta_c$, from a coexistence of both
orientations for $\beta<\beta_c$ to a dominance of one orientation for
$\beta>\beta_c$. We develop an analytical mean-field approach that gives an
insight into these regimes and shows that both dynamics are equivalent along
the crossover line $(r^*,\beta^*)$.

This ordering can
often induce local dependence among nearby variables. However, in complex data,
the width of this dependence may vary, making simple assumptions such as a
constant neighborhood size unrealistic. We propose a framework for learning
this local dependence based on estimating the inverse of the Cholesky factor of
the covariance matrix. Penalized maximum likelihood estimation of this matrix
yields a simple regression interpretation for local dependence in which
variables are predicted by their neighbors. Our proposed method involves
solving a convex, penalized Gaussian likelihood problem with a hierarchical
group lasso penalty. The problem decomposes into independent subproblems which
can be solved efficiently in parallel using first-order methods. Our method
yields a sparse, symmetric, positive definite estimator of the precision
matrix, encoding a Gaussian graphical model. We derive theoretical results not
found in existing methods attaining this structure. In particular, our
conditions for signed support recovery and estimation consistency rates in
multiple norms are as mild as those in a regression problem. Empirical results
show our method performing favorably compared to existing methods. We apply our
method to genomic data to flexibly model linkage disequilibrium. Our method is
also applied to improve the performance of discriminant analysis in sound

equal magnitude. Here we consider the question of whether, for such circuits,
the relative phases of different discrete-time paths through the configuration
space can be defined in terms of a classical action, as they are for
continuous-time paths. We show how to do so for certain kinds of quantum
circuits, namely, Clifford circuits where the elementary systems are
continuous-variable systems or discrete systems of odd-prime dimension. These
types of circuit are distinguished by having phase-space representations that
serve to define their classical counterparts. For discrete systems, the
phase-space coordinates are also discrete variables. We show that for each gate
in the generating set, one can associate a symplectomorphism on the phase-space
and to each of these one can associate a generating function, defined on two
copies of the configuration space. For discrete systems, the latter association
is achieved using tools from algebraic geometry. Finally, we show that if the
action functional for a discrete-time path through a sequence of gates is
defined using the sum of the corresponding generating functions, then it yields
the correct relative phases for the path-sum expression. These results are
likely to be relevant for quantizing physical theories where time is
fundamentally discrete, characterizing the classical limit of discrete-time
quantum dynamics, and proving complexity results for quantum circuits.

This implies that large radiative contributions to the structure functions

recognizing objects and faces, and the peripheral region is useful for scene
recognition. However, the relative importance of central versus peripheral
information for object, scene, and face recognition is unclear. In a behavioral
study, Larson and Loschky (2009) investigated this question by measuring the
scene recognition accuracy as a function of visual angle, and demonstrated that
peripheral vision was indeed more useful in recognizing scenes than central
vision. In this work, we modeled and replicated the result of Larson and
Loschky (2009), using deep convolutional neural networks. Having fit the data
for scenes, we used the model to predict future data for large-scale scene
recognition as well as for objects and faces. Our results suggest that the
relative order of importance of using central visual field information is face
recognition>object recognition>scene recognition, and vice-versa for peripheral
information.

the hydrodynamics without recourse to any ansatz. Our method leads to
microscopic expressions of not only all the transport coefficients that are of
the same form as those in Chapman-Enskog method but also those of the viscous
relaxation times $\tau_i$ that admit physically natural interpretations. As an
example, we apply our microscopic expressions to calculate the transport
coefficients and the relaxation times of the cold fermionic atoms in a
quantitative way, where the transition probability in the collision term is
given explicitly in terms of the $s$-wave scattering length $a_s$. We thereby
discuss the quantum statistical effects, temperature dependence, and
scattering-length dependence of the first-order transport coefficients and the
viscous relaxation times: It is shown that as the temperature is lowered, the
transport coefficients and the relaxation times increase rapidly because Pauli
principle acts effectively. On the other hand, as $a_s$ is increased, these
quantities decrease and become vanishingly small at unitarity because of the
strong coupling. The numerical calculation shows that the relation
$\tau_\pi=\eta/P$, which is derived in the relaxation-time approximation and
used in most of literature without almost any foundation, turns out to be
satisfied quite well, while the similar relation for the relaxation time
$\tau_J$ of the heat conductivity is satisfied only approximately with a
considerable error.

enhanced in such a ""simmering universe"" by boosting the baryon to photon ratio,
although more than an order of magnitude increase is required to bring the

Field Camera 3 on UTC April 27, 2015 at 7.80$\pm$0.04 magnitudes fainter than
Makemake. It likely evaded detection in previous satellite searches due to a
nearly edge-on orbital configuration, placing it deep within the glare of
Makemake during a substantial fraction of its orbital period. This
configuration would place Makemake and its satellite near a mutual event
season. Insufficient orbital motion was detected to make a detailed
characterization of its orbital properties, prohibiting a measurement of the
system mass with the discovery data alone. Preliminary analysis indicates that
if the orbit is circular, its orbital period must be longer than 12.4 days, and
must have a semi-major axis $\gtrsim$21,000 km. We find that the properties of
Makemake's moon suggest that the majority of the dark material detected in the
system by thermal observations may not reside on the surface of Makemake, but
may instead be attributable to S/2015 (136472) 1 having a uniform dark surface.

demand function. The firm sequentially sets prices to earn revenue and to learn
the underlying demand function simultaneously. A natural heuristic for this
problem, commonly used in practice, is greedy iterative least squares (GILS).
At each time period, GILS estimates the demand as a linear function of the
price by applying least squares to the set of prior prices and realized
demands. Then a price that maximizes the revenue, given the estimated demand
function, is used for the next time period. The performance is measured by the
regret, which is the expected revenue loss from the optimal (oracle) pricing
policy when the demand function is known. Recently, den Boer and Zwart (2014)
and Keskin and Zeevi (2014) demonstrated that GILS is sub-optimal. They
introduced algorithms which integrate forced price dispersion with GILS and
achieve asymptotically optimal performance.
  In this paper, we consider this dynamic pricing problem in a data-rich
environment. In particular, we assume that the firm knows the expected demand
under a particular price from historical data, and in each period, before
setting the price, the firm has access to extra information (demand covariates)
which may be predictive of the demand. We prove that in this setting GILS
achieves asymptotically optimal regret of order $\log(T)$. We also show the
following surprising result: in the original dynamic pricing problem of den
Boer and Zwart (2014) and Keskin and Zeevi (2014), inclusion of any set of
covariates in GILS as potential demand covariates (even though they could carry
no information) would make GILS asymptotically optimal. We validate our results

factorize it under the Poisson likelihood. We show its limitation in capturing
the tendency for a covariate present in a sample to both repeat itself and
excite related ones. To address this limitation, we construct negative binomial
factor analysis (NBFA) to factorize the matrix under the negative binomial

mixed-membership model. To support countably infinite factors, we propose the
hierarchical gamma-negative binomial process. By exploiting newly proved
connections between discrete distributions, we construct two blocked and a
collapsed Gibbs sampler that all adaptively truncate their number of factors,
and demonstrate that the blocked Gibbs sampler developed under a compound
Poisson representation converges fast and has low computational complexity.
Example results show that NBFA has a distinct mechanism in adjusting its number

advantages in parsimonious representation, predictive power, and computational
complexity over previously proposed discrete latent variable models, which

video. However, most existing work focus on shorter-term (e.g. minute-long or
hour-long) video sequences. Therefore, we propose a multi-person tracking
algorithm for very long-term (e.g. month-long) multi-camera surveillance
scenarios. Long-term tracking is challenging because 1) the apparel/appearance
of the same person will vary greatly over multiple days and 2) a person will
leave and re-enter the scene numerous times. To tackle these challenges, we
leverage face recognition information, which is robust to apparel change, to
automatically reinitialize our tracker over multiple days of recordings.
Unfortunately, recognized faces are unavailable oftentimes. Therefore, our
tracker propagates identity information to frames without recognized faces by
uncovering the appearance and spatial manifold formed by person detections. We
tested our algorithm on a 23-day 15-camera data set (4,935 hours total), and we
were able to localize a person 53.2% of the time with 69.8% precision. We
further performed video summarization experiments based on our tracking output.
Results on 116.25 hours of video showed that we were able to generate a
reasonable visual diary (i.e. a summary of what a person did) for different
people, thus potentially opening the door to automatic summarization of the
vast amount of surveillance video generated every day.

  The paper focuses on the remarkable fact that, for the canonical linear or

small support outperform the top-of-the-line boundary filters in the
literature. These least-degree filters reduce the error at the boundaries to
less than the error even of the symmetric filters of the same support that are

We find that DF17 has a high GC specific frequency of S_N=26+/-13. The GC
system is extended, with an effective radius of 12""+/-2"", or 5.6+/-0.9 kpc at
Coma distance, 70% larger than the galaxy itself. We also estimate the mean of
the GC luminosity function to infer a distance of 97 (+17/-14) Mpc, providing
redshift-independent confirmation that one of these UDGs is in the Coma
cluster. The presence of a rich GC system in DF17 indicates that, despite its
low stellar density, star formation was intense enough to form many massive
star clusters. If DF17's ratio of total GC mass to total halo mass is similar
to those in other galaxies, then DF17 has an inferred total mass of ~10^11
solar masses, only ~10% the mass of the Milky Way, but extremely dominated by
dark matter, with M/L_V~1000. We suggest that UDGs like DF17 may be ""pure

the consequences for how such networks encode streams of temporal stimuli? On
the one hand, chaos is a strong source of randomness, suggesting that small
changes in stimuli will be obscured by intrinsically generated variability. On
the other hand, recent work shows that the type of chaos that occurs in spiking
networks can have a surprisingly low-dimensional structure, suggesting that
there may be ""room"" for fine stimulus features to be precisely resolved. Here
we show that strongly chaotic networks produce patterned spikes that reliably
encode time-dependent stimuli: using a decoder sensitive to spike times on
timescales of 10's of ms, one can easily distinguish responses to very similar
inputs. Moreover, recurrence serves to distribute signals throughout chaotic
networks so that small groups of cells can encode substantial information about
signals arriving elsewhere. A conclusion is that the presence of strong chaos

  and Intelligence from the Human Face",,,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The human behavior of evaluating other individuals with respect to their
personality traits and intelligence by evaluating their faces plays a crucial
role in human relations. These trait judgments might influence important social
outcomes in our lives such as elections and court sentences. Previous studies
have reported that human can make valid inferences for at least four
personality traits. In addition, some studies have demonstrated that facial
trait evaluation can be learned using machine learning methods accurately. In
this work, we experimentally explore whether self-reported personality traits
and intelligence can be predicted reliably from a facial image. More
specifically, the prediction problem is separately cast in two parts: a
classification task and a regression task. A facial structural feature is
constructed from the relations among facial salient points, and an appearance
feature is built by five texture descriptors. In addition, a minutia-based
fingerprint feature from a fingerprint image is also explored. The
classification results show that the personality traits ""Rule-consciousness""
and ""Vigilance"" can be predicted reliably, and that the traits of females can
be predicted more accurately than those of male. However, the regression
experiments show that it is difficult to predict scores for individual
personality traits and intelligence. The residual plots and the correlation
results indicate no evident linear correlation between the measured scores and
the predicted scores. Both the classification and the regression results reveal
that ""Rule-consciousness"" and ""Tension"" can be reliably predicted from the
facial features, while ""Social boldness"" gets the worst prediction results. The
experiments results show that it is difficult to predict intelligence from
either the facial features or the fingerprint feature, a finding that is in
agreement with previous studies.

Monoceros Ring is an enormous and complex stellar sub-structure in the outer
Milky Way disk. It is most visible across the large Galactic Anticenter region,
120 < l < 240 degrees, -30 < b < +40 degrees. We estimate its stellar mass
density profile along every line of sight in 2 X 2 degree pixels over the
entire 30,000 square degree Pan-STARRS1 survey using the previously developed
MATCH software. By parsing this distribution into a radially smooth component
and the Monoceros Ring, we obtain its mass and distance from the Sun along each
relevant line of sight. The Monoceros Ring is significantly closer to us in the
South (6 kpc) than in the North (9 kpc). We also create 2D cross sections
parallel to the Galactic plane that show 135 degrees of the Monoceros Ring in
the South and 170 degrees of the Monoceros Ring in the North. We show that the
Northern and Southern structures are also roughly concentric circles,
suggesting that they may be a wave rippling from a common origin. Excluding the
Galactic plane, we observe an excess stellar mass of 4 million solar masses
across 120 < l < 240 degrees. If we interpolate across the Galactic plane, we
estimate that this region contains 8 million solar masses. If we assume
(somewhat boldly) that the Monoceros Ring is a set of two Galactocentric rings,
its total stellar mass is 60 million solar masses. Finally, if we assume that
it is a set of two circles centered at a point 4 kpc from the Galactic center
in the anti-central direction, as our data suggests, we estimate its stellar

for a better understanding of the relationship between the MFR and the
associated activities. In this paper, we investigate the magnetic field of
active region 12017 from 2014 March 28 to 29, where 12 flares were triggered by
the intermittent eruptions of a filament (either successful or confined). Using
the vector magnetic field data from the Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager on
board the \textit{Solar Dynamics Observatory}, we calculate the magnetic energy
and helicity injection in the active region, and extrapolate the 3D magnetic
field with a nonlinear force-free field model. From the extrapolations, we find
an MFR that is cospatial with the filament. We further determine the
configuration of this MFR by a closed quasi-separatrix layer (QSL) around it.
Then, we calculate the twist number and the magnetic helicity for the field
lines composing the MFR. The results show that the closed QSL structure
surrounding the MFR gets smaller as a consequence of the flare occurrence. We
also find that the flares in our sample are mainly triggered by kink
instability. Moreover, the twist number varies more sensitively than other
parameters to the occurrence of flares.

appearance of objects. Most existing algorithms try to resolve this problem as
an object-specific task, i.e., the model is trained to regenerate or classify a
specific object. As a result, the model need to be initialized and retrained
for different objects. In this paper, we propose a more generic approach
utilizing a novel two-flow convolutional neural network (named YCNN). The YCNN
takes two inputs (one is object image patch, the other is search image patch),
then outputs a response map which predicts how likely the object appears in a
specific location. Unlike those object-specific approach, the YCNN is trained
to measure the similarity between two image patches. Thus it will not be
confined to any specific object. Furthermore the network can be end-to-end
trained to extract both shallow and deep convolutional features which are
dedicated for visual tracking. And once properly trained, the YCNN can be
applied to track all kinds of objects without further training and updating.
Benefiting from the once-for-all model, our algorithm is able to run at a very
high speed of 45 frames-per-second. The experiments on 51 sequences also show
that our algorithm achieves an outstanding performance.

particles of different sizes and shapes develop depending on the amount of gold
precursor. When compact monolayer assembly is formed on solution surface, nano
energy in packet shapes bind gold atoms in own shape. Between 0.07 mM to 0.90
mM precursor concentration, tiny particles develop in both triangular and
non-triangular shapes. Tiny particles of triangular shape develop in a large
number at precursor concentration 0.30 mM and 0.60 mM. Hence, nanoparticles and
particles also developed in different geometrical shapes. Such tiny particles
pack due to the exerted force in immersing format, where made structures of
smooth elements assemble to develop nanoparticles and particles of different
shapes. Tiny particles of non-geometrical shapes do not assemble at a common
point and their assembling develops a nanoparticle or particle of distorted or
spherical shape. This occurs mainly when precursor concentration is 0.05 mM and
1.20 mM. At 50 sccm Argon flow rate, nanoparticles and particles develop in the
same shapes as in case of 100 sccm. For different precursor concentrations,
different colors of solutions indicate different features of nanoparticles and

growing sizes of graphs, even traditionally fast clustering methods such as
spectral partitioning can be computationally expensive for real-world graphs of
interest. Motivated partly by this, so-called local algorithms for graph
clustering have received significant interest due to the fact that they can
find good clusters in a graph with work proportional to the size of the cluster
rather than that of the entire graph. This feature has proven to be crucial in
making such graph clustering and many of its downstream applications efficient
in practice. While local clustering algorithms are already faster than

there is an opportunity to make them even more efficient via parallelization.
In this paper, we show how to parallelize many of these algorithms in the
shared-memory multicore setting, and we analyze the parallel complexity of
these algorithms. We present comprehensive experiments on large-scale graphs
showing that our parallel algorithms achieve good parallel speedups on a modern
multicore machine, thus significantly speeding up the analysis of local graph
clusters in the very large-scale setting.

structures of two-dimensional transition metal carbides and nitrides, so called
MXenes, functionalized with F, O, and OH. Our projected band structures and
electron localization function analyses reveal the existence of nearly free
electron (NFE) states in variety of MXenes. The NFE states are spatially
located just outside the atomic structure of MXenes and are extended parallel
to the surfaces. Moreover, we found that the OH-terminated MXenes offer the NFE
states energetically close to the Fermi level. In particular, the NFE states in
some of the OH-terminated MXenes, such as Ti2C(OH)2, Zr2C(OH)2, Zr2N(OH)2,
Hf2C(OH)2, Hf2N(OH)2, Nb2C(OH)2, and Ta2C(OH)2, are partially occupied. This is
in remarkable contrast to graphene, graphane, and MoS2, in which their NFE
states are located far above the Fermi level and thus they are unoccupied. As a
prototype of such systems, we investigated the electron transport properties of
Hf2C(OH)2 and found that the NFE states in Hf2C(OH)2 provide almost perfect
transmission channels without nuclear scattering for electron transport. Our
results indicate that these systems might find applications in nanoelectronic
devices. Our findings provide new insights into the unique electronic band

at the International Linear Collider (ILC), using events in which a Higgs boson
recoils against a Z boson decaying into a pair of muons or electrons. The
analysis is carried out for three center-of-mass energies $\sqrt{s}$ = 250,
350, and 500 GeV, and two beam polarizations $\mathrm{e_{L}^{-}e_{R}^{+}}$ and
$\mathrm{e_{R}^{-}e_{L}^{+}}$, for which the polarizations of $\mathrm{e^{-}}$

luminosity of 250 $\mathrm{fb^{-1}}$ for each beam polarization at $\sqrt{s}$ =
250 GeV, where the best lepton momentum resolution is obtainable,
$\sigma_{\mathrm{ZH}}$ and $M_{\mathrm{H}}$ can be determined with a precision
of 2.5\% and 37 MeV for $\mathrm{e_{L}^{-}e_{R}^{+}}$ and 2.9\% and 41 MeV for

program, the expected precisions for the $\mathrm{HZZ}$ coupling and

selection is designed to optimize the precisions of $\sigma_{\mathrm{ZH}}$ and
$M_{\mathrm{H}}$ while minimizing the bias on the measured
$\sigma_{\mathrm{ZH}}$ due to discrepancy in signal efficiencies among Higgs
decay modes. For the first time, model independence has been demonstrated to a
sub-percent level for the $\sigma_{\mathrm{ZH}}$ measurement at each of the
three center-of-mass energies. The results presented show the impact of
center-of-mass energy and beam polarization on the evaluated precisons and
serve as a benchmark for the planning of the ILC run scenario.

quality of computation experience for mobile devices. Nevertheless, the design
of computation task scheduling policies for MEC systems inevitably encounters a
challenging two-timescale stochastic optimization problem. Specifically, in the
larger timescale, whether to execute a task locally at the mobile device or to
offload a task to the MEC server for cloud computing should be decided, while
in the smaller timescale, the transmission policy for the task input data
should adapt to the channel side information. In this paper, we adopt a Markov
decision process approach to handle this problem, where the computation tasks
are scheduled based on the queueing state of the task buffer, the execution
state of the local processing unit, as well as the state of the transmission
unit. By analyzing the average delay of each task and the average power
consumption at the mobile device, we formulate a power-constrained delay
minimization problem, and propose an efficient one-dimensional search algorithm
to find the optimal task scheduling policy. Simulation results are provided to
demonstrate the capability of the proposed optimal stochastic task scheduling
policy in achieving a shorter average execution delay compared to the baseline
policies.

the reference state, is bound to a decagonal ring of cylinders and the other,
the sensing state, to the defect cavities of the lattice. It is shown that
defect mode is very sensitive to the presence of materials with dielectric
permittivity different from that of the surrounding cylinders while the state
in the PM is not affected by their presence. This behavior allows to design a
device for sensing applications. A prototype of the sensor, in the microwave
region, was built using a matrix of 3x2 PM arrays made of soda-lime glass
cylinders (dielectric permittivity of 4.5). The transmission spectra was
measured in the microwave range (8-12 GHz) with samples of different refractive
index inserted in the defect cavities. Simulations with Finite Integration
time-domain Method are in good agreement with experiments. We find that the
response of the sensor is linear. Device measurement range is determined by the
dielectric constant of the cylinders that make up the device. The results here
presented in the microwave region can be extrapolated to the visible range due
to scale invariance of Maxwell equations. This make our prototype a promising

opened for their topologica surface states by breaking time reversal symmetry.
The gap opening has been achieved by doping magnetic impurities, which however
inevitably create extra carriers and disorder that undermine the electronic
transport. In contrast, the proximity to a ferromagnetic/ferrimagnetic
insulator may improve the device quality, thus promises a better way to open
the gap while minimizing the side-effects. Here, we grow thin single-crystal
Sb1.9Bi0.1Te3 micro flakes on insulating ferrimagnet BaFe12O19 by using the van
der Waals epitaxy technique. The micro flakes show a negative magnetoresistance
in weak perpendicular fields below 50 K, which can be quenched by increasing
temperature. The signature implies the weak localization effect as its origin,
which is absent in intrinsic topological insulators, unless a surface state gap
is opened. The surface state gap is estimated to be 10 meV by using the theory
of the gap-induced weak localization effect. These results indicate that the
magnetic proximity effect may open the gap for the topological surface attached
to BaM insulating ferrimagnet. This heterostructure may pave the way for the
realization of new physical effects as well as the potential applications of
spintronics devices.

in addition to the lines previously known. The presence of such high velocities
in the molecular emission from IRAS 20100$-$4156 could be explained by a ~50 pc
molecular ring enclosing an approximately 3.8 billion solar mass black hole. We
also discuss two alternatives, i.e. that the narrow-line masers are dynamically
coupled to the wind driven by the active galactic nucleus or they are
associated with two separate galactic nuclei. The comparison between the BETA

data, combined with previous measurements of the source enabled us to study the
variability of the source over a twenty-six year period. The flux density of
the brightest OH maser components has reduced by more than a factor of two

support his famous hypothesis on the existence of a spherical cloud containing
hundreds of billions of comets with orbits of semimajor axes between 50 and 150
thousand au. Comet Brooks stands out from this group because of a long series
of astrometric observations as well as nearly two-year long observational arc.
Rich observational material makes this comet an ideal target for testing the
rationality of an effort to recalculate astrometric positions on the basis of
original (comet-star)-measurements using modern star catalogues. This paper
presents the results of such new analysis based on two different methods: (i)
automatic re-reduction based on cometary positions and the
(comet-star)-measurements, and (ii) partially automatic re-reduction based on
the contemporary data for originally used reference stars. We show that both
methods offer a significant reduction of orbital elements uncertainties. Based
on the most preferred orbital solution, the dynamical evolution of comet Brooks
during three consecutive perihelion passages is discussed. We conclude that
C/1890 F1 is a dynamically old comet that passed the Sun at a distance below 5
au during its previous perihelion passage. Furthermore, its next perihelion
passage will be a little closer than during the 1890-1892 apparition. C/1890 F1
is interesting also because it suffered extremely small planetary perturbations
when it travelled through the planetary zone. Therefore, in the next passage
through perihelion it will be once again a comet from the Oort spike.

extension of PS that is ex post efficient and weak strategyproof. The result is
surprising because it does not even require additional symmetry or fairness
conditions such as anonymity, neutrality, or equal treatment of equals. Our
result further demonstrates that the lack of weak SD-strategyproofness of the

Gaussian curvature (Euler characteristic) and its successive dispersal into
various condensed matter properties such as quantum Hall effect, and
topological invariants, we can establish a simple and fairly universal
understanding of various modern topological insulators (TIs). Formation of a
periodic lattice (which is a non-trivial Gaussian curvature) of 'cyclotron
orbits' with applied magnetic field, or 'chiral orbits' with fictitious
'momentum space magnetic field' (Berry curvature) guarantees its flux
quantization, and thus integer quantum Hall (IQH), and quantum spin-Hall (QSH)
insulators, respectively, occur. The bulk-boundary correspondence associated
with all classes of TIs dictates that some sort of pumping or polarization of a
'quantity' at the boundary must be associated with the flux quantization or
topological invariant in the bulk. Unlike charge or spin polarizations at the
edge for IQH and QSH states, the time-reversal (TR) invariant Z2 TIs pump a
mathematical quantity called 'TR polarization' to the surface. This requires
that the valence electron's wavefunction (say, {\psi}_{\uparrow} (k)) switches
to its TR conjugate ({\psi}_{\downarrow}^* (-k)) odd number of times in half of
the Brillouin zone. These two universal features can be considered as 'targets'
to design and predict various TIs. For example, we demonstrate that when two
adjacent atomic chains or layers are assembled with opposite spin-orbit
coupling (SOC), serving as the TR partner to each other, the system naturally
becomes a Z2 TI. This review delivers a holistic overview on various concepts,
computational schemes, and engineering principles of TIs.

decomposing a multi-way classification problem into many binary classification

solution to the original problem. Firstly, the image features are extracted by
Principal Components Analysis (PCA). After that, ECOC is used for
identification the Persian handwritten letters which it uses Support Vector

ensemble method using 10 real-world data sets of Persian handwritten letters
indicate that this method has better results in identifying the Persian

paper found that we can reduce the additional cost in feature selection stage

importance to understand the behavior of financial markets. Part I of this
paper reported the remarkable improvements in the description of the price
dynamics which can be obtained when one incorporates the impact of past returns
on the future order flow. However, impact models presented in Part I consider
the order flow as an exogenous process, only characterized by its two-point
correlations. This assumption seriously limits the forecasting ability of the
model. Here we attempt to model directly the stream of discrete events with a
so-called Mixture Transition Distribution (MTD) framework, introduced
originally by Raftery (1985). We distinguish between price-changing and non
price-changing events and combine them with the order sign in order to reduce
the order flow dynamics to the dynamics of a four-state discrete random
variable. The MTD represents a parsimonious approximation of a full high-order
Markov chain. The new approach captures with adequate realism the conditional
correlation functions between signed events for both small and large tick
stocks and signature plots. From a methodological viewpoint, we discuss a novel
and flexible way to calibrate a large class of MTD models with a very large
number of parameters. In spite of this large number of parameters, an
out-of-sample analysis confirms that the model does not overfit the data.

In quantum mechanics, systems with an evolution described by a so-called unital
quantum channel evolve with a non-decreasing entropy. Here, we seek the
opposite, a system described by a non-unital and, furthermore,
energy-conserving channel that describes a system whose entropy decreases with
time. We propose a setup involving a mesoscopic four-lead scatterer augmented
by a micro-environment in the form of a spin that realizes this goal. Within
this non-unital and energy-conserving quantum channel, the micro-environment
acts with two non-commuting operations on the system in an autonomous way. We
find, that the process corresponds to a partial exchange or swap between the
system and environment quantum states, with the system's entropy decreasing if
the environment's state is more pure. This entropy-decreasing process is
naturally expressed through the action of a quantum Maxwell demon and we
propose a quantum-thermodynamic engine with four qubits that extracts work from
a single heat reservoir when provided with a reservoir of pure qubits. The
special feature of this engine, which derives from the energy-conservation in
the non-unital quantum channel, is its separation into two cycles, a working
cycle and an entropy cycle, allowing to run this engine with no local waste

galactic nuclei (AGN). Traditionally referred to as the receding dusty torus,
its inner radius and angular extension should depend on the photo-ionizing
luminosity of the central source. Using a Monte Carlo approach, we simulate the
radiative transfer between the multiple components of an AGN adopting model
constraints from the bright Seyfert galaxy NGC 4151. We compare our model
results to the observed near-IR to UV polarization of the source and predict
its X-ray polarization. We find that the 2-8 keV polarization fraction of a
standard AGN model varies from less then a few percent along polar viewing
angles up to tens of percent at equatorial inclinations. At viewing angles
around the type-1/type-2 transition the X-ray polarization variability differs
between a static or a receding torus scenario. In the former case, the expected
2-8 keV polarization of NGC 4151 is found to be 1.21% +/- 0.34% with a constant
polarization position angle, while in the later scenario it varies from 0.1% to
6% depending on the photon index of the primary radiation. Additionally, an
orthogonal rotation of the polarization position angle with photon energy
appears for very soft primary spectra. Future X-ray polarimetry missions will
be able to test if the receding model is valid for Seyfert galaxies seen at a
viewing angle close to the torus horizon. The overall stability of the
polarization position angle for photon indexes softer than {\Gamma} = 1.5
ensures that reliable measurements of X-ray polarization are possible. We
derive a long-term observational strategy for NGC 4151 assuming observations

between the Neumann and Dirichlet phases is analyzed in arbitrary dimension $d$

that the translational symmetry along the entangling surface is broken due the

simply twice the entropy in the case of single plane boundary. Additionally, we

oscillation modes in low viscosity disks around isolated and binary Be stars.
Observations show that some Be stars exhibit evidence of formation and
dissipation of the equatorial disk. In this paper, we first calculate the
density evolution in disks around isolated Be stars. To model the formation
stage of the disk, we inject mass at a radius just outside the star at a
constant rate for 30-50 years. As the disk develops, the density distribution
approaches the form of the steady disk solution. Then, we turn off the mass
injection to model the disk dissipation stage. The innermost part of the disk
starts accretion, and a gap forms between the star and the disk. Next, we
calculate the one-armed modes at several epochs. We neglect the effect of
viscosity because the time-scale of oscillations is much shorter than the disk
evolution time-scale for low viscosity. In the disk formation stage, the
eigenfrequency increases with time toward the value for the steady state disk.
On the other hand, one-armed eigenmodes in dissipating Be disks have
significantly higher eigenfrequencies and narrower propagation regions.
Observationally, such a change of mode characteristics can be taken as an
evidence for gap opening around the star. In binary Be stars, the
characteristics of the disk evolution and the eigenmodes are qualitatively the
same as in isolated Be stars, but quantitatively they have shorter evolution
time-scales and higher eigenfrequencies, which is in agreement with the
observed trend.

compressibility is observed. Here, the nature of these compressive fluctuations
is found to be characterized by coherent structures. Although previous studies
have shown that current sheets can be considered as the principal cause of
intermittency at ion scales, here we show for the first time that, in the case
of the slow solar wind, a large variety of coherent structures contributes to
intermittency at proton scales, and current sheets are not the most common.
Specifically, we find compressive ($\delta b_{\|} \gg \delta b_{\perp}$),
linearly polarized structures in the form of magnetic holes, solitons and shock
waves. Examples of Alfv\'enic structures ($\delta b_{\perp} > \delta b_{\|}$)
are identified as current sheets and vortex-like structures. Some of these
vortices have $ \delta b_{\perp} \gg \delta b_{\|}$, as in the case of Alfv\'en
vortices, but the majority of them are characterized by $\delta b_{\perp}
\gtrsim \delta b_{\|}$. Thanks to multi-point measurements by Cluster
spacecraft, for about 100 structures, we could determine the normal, the
propagation velocity and the spatial scale along this normal. Independently of
the nature of the structures, the normal is always perpendicular to the local
magnetic field, meaning that $k_{\perp} \gg k_{\parallel}$. The spatial scales
of the studied structures are found to be between 2 and 8 times the proton
gyroradius. Most of them are simply convected by the wind, but 25\% propagate

This means multiplexing of quantum key distribution (QKD) and strong classical
data signals, delivering quantum signals and classic signals in one fiber.
Optical splitters are employed to access each user in a gigabit-capable passive
optical network (GPON). In a 4-user network the splitter adds at least 6 dB of
optical loss to the quantum channel, a 64-user network the splitter adds 18 dB
of optical loss to the quantum channel. The optical splitters restrict the
transmission distance and performance of QKD. We propose a new integration
program of QKD and GPON based on wavelength-division multiplexing (WDM). At the
optical splitting point, we use filters to separate the quantum signals and
bypass the optical splitter, avoiding losses produced by the optical splitters.
This increases the counting rate of the quantum signals states and the signal
to noise ratio (SNR) improves, so a higher key generation rate and a longer
transmission distance can be obtained with QKD.

combine lithium equivalent width measurements, EW(Li), from the Gaia-ESO Survey

consider only bona fide non accreting cluster members in order to minimize
uncertainties on EW(Li). We report the existence of a relationship between
lithium content and rotation in NGC~2264 at an age of 5~Myr. The Li-rotation
connection is seen over a restricted temperature range, Teff=3800--4400K, where
fast rotators are Li-rich compared to slow ones. This correlation is similar
to, albeit of lower amplitude than, the Li-rotation connection previously
reported for K dwarfs in the 125 Myr-old Pleiades cluster. We investigate
whether the non-standard pre-main sequence models developed so far to explain
the Pleiades results, which are based on episodic accretion, pre-main sequence
core-envelope decoupling, and/or radius inflation due to enhanced magnetic
activity, can account for an early development of the Li-rotation connection.
While radius inflation appears to be the most promising possibility, each of
these models has issues. We therefore also discuss external causes that might
operate during the first few Myr of pre-main sequence evolution, such as planet
engulfment and/or steady disk accretion, as possible candidates for the common
origin for Li-excess and fast rotation in young low-mass pre-main sequence
stars. The emergence of a connection between lithium content and rotation rate
at such an early age as 5~Myr suggests a complex link between accretion
processes, early angular momentum evolution, and possibly planet formation,
which likely impacts early stellar evolution and still is to be fully
deciphered.

an antiferromagnet has been demonstrated [P. Wadley et al., Science 351, 587

been extensively studied in ferromagnets. In this phenomena a non-equilibrium
spin-polarization exchange coupled to the ordered local moments is induced by
current, hence exerting a torque on the order parameter. Here we give a general
systematic analysis of the symmetry of the spin-orbit torque in locally and

to the recently proposed, the so called Pre-Orthogonal Greedy Algorithm (P-OGA)
involving completion of a given dictionary. The new method is called Aveiro
Method Under Complete Dictionary (AMUCD). The complete dictionary consists of
all directional derivatives of the underlying reproducing kernels. We show
that, under the boundary vanishing condition, bring available for the classical
Hardy and Paley-Wiener spaces, the complete dictionary enables an efficient
expansion of any given element in the Hilbert space. The proposed method
reveals new and advanced aspects in both the Aveiro Method and the greedy
algorithm.

transferring method over SMS in satellite communication. Voice transferring
method over SMS is useful in situations when signal strength is low and due to
poor signal strength voice call connection is not possible to initiate or
signal dropped during voice call. This method has one serious flaw that it
produces large number of SMS while converting voice into SMS. Such issue is
catered to some extend by employing any compression algorithm. In this paper
our major aim is to find best compression scheme for said method, for that
purpose we compare 6 different types of compression algorithms which are; LZW
(Lempel-Ziv-Welch), Huffman coding, PPM (Prediction by partial matching),
Arithmetic Coding (AC), BWT (Burrows-Wheeler-Transform), LZMA
(Lempel-Ziv-Markov chain). This comparison shows that PPM compression method
offers better compression ratio and produce small number of SMS. For
experimentation we use Thuraya SG-2520 satellite phone. Moreover, we develop an
application using J2ME platform[Ref:a]. We tested that application more than
100 times and then we compare the result in terms of compression ratio of each
algorithm and number of connected SMS produce after each compression method.
The result of this study will help developers to choose better compression
scheme for their respective applications.

class of Bohnenblust--Hille type inequalities for $m$--linear forms. While
germinal estimates indicated an exponential growth, in this work we provide
strong evidences to the conjecture that the sharp constants in the classical
Bohnenblust--Hille inequality are universally bounded, irrespectively of the
value of $m$; hereafter referred as the \textit{Universality Conjecture}. In
our approach, we introduce the {notions of entropy and complexity}, designed to
measure, to some extent, the complexity of such optimization problems. We show
that the notion of entropy is critically connected to the Universality
Conjecture; for instance, that if the entropy grows at most exponentially with
respect to $m$, then the optimal constants of the $m$% --linear
Bohnenblust--Hille inequality for real scalars are indeed bounded universally
in $m$. It is likely that indeed the entropy grows as $4^{m-1}$, and in this
scenario, we show that the optimal constants are precisely $2^{1-\frac{1}{m}}
$. In the bilinear case, $m=2$, we show that any extremum of the Littlewood's
$4/3$-inequality has entropy $4$ and complexity $2$, and thus we are able to
classify all extrema of the problem. We also prove that, for any mixed $\left(
\ell _{1},\ell _{2}\right) $% --Littlewood inequality, the entropy do grow
exponentially and the sharp constants for such a class of inequalities are
precisely $(\sqrt{2})^{m-1}$. In addition to the {notions of entropy and
complexity}, the approach we develop in this work makes decisive use of a
family of strongly non-symmetric $m$--linear forms, which has further
consequences to the theory, as we explain herein.

dwarf candidates. Additionally, we combine SOPHIE data with velocities obtained
at the Lick Observatory to improve the parameters of an already known giant
planet companion, HD16175 b. Thanks to the use of different instruments, the
data sets of all four targets span more than ten years. Zero-point offsets
between instruments are dealt with using Bayesian priors to incorporate the
information we possess on the SOPHIE/ELODIE offset based on previous studies.
  The reported companions have orbital periods between three and five years and
minimum masses between 1.6 Mjup and 19 Mjup. Additionally, we find that the
star HD191806 is experiencing a secular acceleration of over 11 \ms\ per year,
potentially due to an additional stellar or substellar companion. A search for
the astrometric signature of these companions was carried out using Hipparcos
data. No orbit was detected, but a significant upper limit to the companion
mass can be set for HD221585, whose companion must be substellar.
  With the exception of HD191806 b, the companions are located within the
habitable zone of their host star. Therefore, satellites orbiting these objects

we recover the expected deformation field within 1 micron. For a pure viscous
fluid seeded with tracer particles, we measure the velocity profile and the
dynamics of the tracers, both during shear and at rest. The velocity profile is
acquired over a gap of 5 mm with a temporal and spatial resolution of 1 s and
100 microns, respectively. At rest, the tracer dynamics have the expected
diffusive behavior. Under shear, the microscopic dynamics corrected for the
average drift due to solid rotation scale with the local shear rate,
demonstrating that our setup captures correctly the relative motion of the
tracers due to the affine deformation.

dropping, which results in serious performance degradation (e.g., Incast
problem). However, current solutions that attempt to suppress micro-burst
traffic are extrinsic and ad hoc, since they lack the comprehensive and
essential understanding of micro-burst's root cause and dynamic behavior. On
the other hand, traditional studies focus on traffic burstiness in a single
flow, while in data centers micro-burst traffic could occur with highly fan-in
communication pattern, and its dynamic behavior is still unclear. To this end,
in this paper we re-examine the micro-burst traffic in typical data center
scenarios. We find that evolution of micro-burst is determined by both TCP's
self-clocking mechanism and bottleneck link. Besides, dynamic behaviors of
micro-burst under various scenarios can all be described by the slope of queue
length increasing. Our observations also implicate that conventional solutions
like absorbing and pacing are ineffective to mitigate micro-burst traffic.
Instead, senders need to slow down as soon as possible. Inspired by the
findings and insights from experimental observations, we propose S-ECN policy,
which is an ECN marking policy leveraging the slope of queue length increasing.
Transport protocols utilizing S-ECN policy can suppress the sharp queue length
increment by over 50%, and reduce the 99th percentile of query completion time
by ~20%.

non-adiabatic expansion during inflation. Intriguingly, from bounds on the

a limit on the exotic instantonic coupling of $<10^{-2}\div 10^{-3}$. This also
sets important constrains on the Calabi-Yau compactifications and on the string

uncertainties in stochastic dynamical models is well-known to face challenging
issues. The accuracy of PCEs degenerates quickly in time. Thus maintaining a
sufficient level of long term accuracy requires the use of high-order
polynomials. In numerous cases, it is even infeasible to obtain accurate
metamodels with regular PCEs due to the fact that PCEs cannot represent the

proposed that combines PCEs and non-linear autoregressive with exogenous input
(NARX) models, which are a universal tool in the field of system
identification. The approach relies on using NARX models to mimic the dynamical
behaviour of the system and dealing with the uncertainties using PCEs. The
PC-NARX model was built by means of heuristic genetic algorithms. This paper
aims at introducing the least angle regression (LAR) technique for computing
PC-NARX models, which consists in solving two linear regression problems. The
proposed approach is validated with structural mechanics case studies, in which
uncertainties arising from both structures and excitations are taken into
account. Comparison with Monte Carlo simulation and regular PCEs is also
carried out to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

is the well known Big Match of Gillete (1957). These games may not allow
optimal strategies but they always have {\epsilon}-optimal strategies. In this

use only O(log log T ) space. Furthermore, we construct strategies for Player 1
that use space s(T), for an arbitrary small unbounded non-decreasing function
s, and which guarantee an {\epsilon}-optimal value for Player 1 in the limit
superior sense. The previously known strategies use space {\Omega}(logT) and it
was known that no strategy can use constant space if it is {\epsilon}-optimal

important use case is viral marketing: given a promotion budget, an advertiser
can choose some influential users as the seed set and provide them free or
discounted sample products; in this way, the advertiser hopes to increase the
popularity of the product in the users' friend circles by the world-of-mouth
effect, and thus maximizes the number of users that information of the
production can reach. There has been a body of literature studying the
influence maximization problem. Nevertheless, the existing studies mostly
investigate the problem on a one-off basis, assuming fixed known influence
probabilities among users, or the knowledge of the exact social network
topology. In practice, the social network topology and the influence
probabilities are typically unknown to the advertiser, which can be varying
over time, i.e., in cases of newly established, strengthened or weakened social
ties. In this paper, we focus on a dynamic non-stationary social network and
design a randomized algorithm, RSB, based on multi-armed bandit optimization,
to maximize influence propagation over time. The algorithm produces a sequence
of online decisions and calibrates its explore-exploit strategy utilizing
outcomes of previous decisions. It is rigorously proven to achieve an
upper-bounded regret in reward and applicable to large-scale social networks.
Practical effectiveness of the algorithm is evaluated using both synthetic and
real-world datasets, which demonstrates that our algorithm outperforms previous
stationary methods under non-stationary conditions.

are interesting for many applications. A particular case of these resonances
can be found in 2D quasi-crystalline arrangements of dielectric cylinders.
These systems present a rather isotropic band gap as well as isolated in-gap
photonic states (as a result of spatially localized resonances). These states
are built by high symmetry polygonal clusters that can be regarded as photonic
molecules. In this paper we study the transmission properties of a slab of
glass cylinders arranged in approximants of decagonal quasi-crystalline
structure. In particular, we investigate the influence of the slab width in the
transmission contrast between the states and the gap. The study is both
experimental and numerical in the microwave regime. We find that the best
transmission contrast is found for a width of around 3 times the radiation
wavelength. The transmission at the band gap region is mediated by the
resonances of the photonic molecules. If the samples are thin enough they
become transparent except around a resonance of the photonic molecule which
reflects the incoming light. In this case the behavior is reminiscent of an
absorbing molecule.

convective envelope. Fast rotators on the main sequence, or Ap star
descendants, are expected to become magnetic active subgiants during this
evolutionary phase. Aims: We compare the surface magnetic fields and activity
indicators of two active, fast rotating red giants with similar masses and
spectral class but diferent rotation rates - OU And (Prot=24.2 d) and 31 Com
(Prot=6.8 d) - to address the question of the origin of their magnetism and
high activity.
  Methods: Observations were carried out with the Narval spectropolarimeter in
2008 and 2013.We used the least squares deconvolution technique to extract
Stokes V and I profiles to detect Zeeman signatures of the magnetic field of
the stars. We provide Zeeman-Doppler imaging, activity indicator monitoring,

models to infer the evolutionary status and the initial rotation velocity on
the main sequence.
  Results: The detected magnetic field of OU And is a strong one. Its
longitudinal component Bl reaches 40 G and presents an about sinusoidal
variation with reversal of the polarity. The magnetic topology of OU And is
dominated by large scale elements and is mainly poloidal with an important
dipole component, and a significant toroidal component. The detected magnetic
field of 31 Com is weaker, with a magnetic map showing a more complex field
geometry, and poloidal and toroidal components of equal contributions. The

collisions at the centre-of-mass energy per nucleon pair of $\sqrt{s_{_{\rm
NN}}}=2.76$ TeV by the ALICE experiment at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). The
centrality dependence of correlation between event-by-event fluctuations of the
elliptic, $v_2$, and quadrangular, $v_4$, flow harmonics, as well as of
anti-correlation between $v_2$ and triangular, $v_3$, flow harmonics are
presented. The results cover two different regimes of the initial state
configurations: geometry-dominated (in mid-central collisions) and
fluctuation-dominated (in the most central collisions). Comparisons are made to
predictions from MC-Glauber, viscous hydrodynamics, AMPT and HIJING models.
Together with the existing measurements of individual flow harmonics the
presented results provide further constraints on initial conditions and the
transport properties of the system produced in heavy-ion collisions.

  intersection, ADMM",,,,"cs.CV cs.DS","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  This paper revisits the integer programming (IP) problem, which plays a
fundamental role in many computer vision and machine learning applications. The
literature abounds with many seminal works that address this problem, some
focusing on continuous approaches (e.g. linear program relaxation) while others
on discrete ones (e.g., min-cut). However, a limited number of them are
designed to handle the general IP form and even these methods cannot adequately
satisfy the simultaneous requirements of accuracy, feasibility, and
scalability. To this end, we propose a novel and versatile framework called
$\ell_p$-box ADMM, which is based on two parts. (1) The discrete constraint is
equivalently replaced by the intersection of a box and a $(n-1)$-dimensional
sphere (defined through the $\ell_p$ norm). (2) We infuse this equivalence into
the ADMM (Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers) framework to handle
these continuous constraints separately and to harness its attractive
properties. More importantly, the ADMM update steps can lead to manageable
sub-problems in the continuous domain. To demonstrate its efficacy, we consider
an instance of the framework, namely $\ell_2$-box ADMM applied to binary
quadratic programming (BQP). Here, the ADMM steps are simple, computationally
efficient, and theoretically guaranteed to converge to a KKT point. We
demonstrate the applicability of $\ell_2$-box ADMM on three important
applications: MRF energy minimization, graph matching, and clustering. Results
clearly show that it significantly outperforms existing generic IP solvers both
in runtime and objective. It also achieves very competitive performance vs.
state-of-the-art methods specific to these applications.

Transferring the knowledge learned with optical flow CNN to motion vector CNN

introduce three strategies for this, initialization transfer, supervision

investigate numerically the nature of the subproton-scale turbulent cascade for
typical SW parameters by means of unprecedented high-resolution simulations of

dominated by KAWs at $\beta\gtrsim1$ and by magnetosonic/whistler fluctuations
at lower $\beta$. The spectral properties of the turbulence appear to be in
good agreement with theoretical predictions. A tentative interpretation of this
result in terms of relative changes in the damping rates of the different waves
is also presented. Overall, the results raise interesting new questions about
the properties and variability of subproton-scale turbulence in the SW,
including its possible dependence on the plasma $\beta$, and call for detailed

and coherent X-ray generation coupled with the large size of modern radio
frequency (RF) accelerator devices and facilities has motivated a strong need
for alternative accelerators operating in regimes outside of RF. Working at
optical frequencies, dielectric laser accelerators (DLAs) - transparent
laser-driven nanoscale dielectric structures whose near fields can
synchronously accelerate charged particles - have demonstrated high-gradient
acceleration with a variety of laser wavelengths, materials, and electron beam
parameters, potentially enabling miniaturized accelerators and table-top
coherent x-ray sources. To realize a useful (i.e. scalable) DLA, crucial
developments have remained: concatenation of components including sustained
phase synchronicity to reach arbitrary final energies as well as deflection and
focusing elements to keep the beam well collimated along the design axis. Here,
all of these elements are demonstrated with a subrelativistic electron beam. In
particular, by creating two interaction regions via illumination of a
nanograting with two spatio-temporally separated pulsed laser beams, we
demonstrate a phase-controlled doubling of electron energy gain from 0.7 to 1.4
keV (2.5 percent to 5 percent of the initial beam energy) and through use of a
chirped grating geometry, we overcome the dephasing limit of 25 keV electrons,
increasing their energy gains to a laser power limited 10 percent of their
initial energy. Further, optically-driven transverse focusing of the electron
beam with focal lengths below 200 microns is achieved via a parabolic grating
geometry. These results lay the cornerstone for future miniaturized phase
synchronous vacuum-structure-based accelerators.

counter-intuitive that humanity has not been contacted by extraterrestrial

whether this apparent loneliness is, in fact, unexpected. An inequality was
derived to relate the frequency of life arising and developing technology on a
suitable planet in the galaxy, the average length of time since the first
broadcast of such a civilization, and a constant term. An analysis of the
sphere reached thus far by human communication was also conducted, considering
our local neighborhood and planets of particular interest. We clearly show that
human communication has not reached a number of stars and planets adequate to
expect an answer. These analyses both conclude that the Fermi paradox is not,
in fact, unexpected. By the mediocrity principle and numerical modeling, it is
actually unlikely that the Earth would have been reached by extraterrestrial
communication at this point. We predict that under 1 percent of the galaxy has
been reached at all thus far, and we do not anticipate to be reached until
approximately half of the stars/planets have been reached. We offer a
prediction that we should not expect this until at least 1,500 years in the
future. Thus the Fermi paradox is not a shocking observation, and humanity may
very well be contacted within our species' lifespan.

formal democratic institutions with authoritarian practices. Although in such
countries the ruling elites may receive considerable voter support they often
employ several manipulation tools to control election outcomes. A common
practice of these regimes is the coercion and mobilization of a significant
amount of voters to guarantee the electoral victory. This electoral
irregularity is known as voter rigging, distinguishing it from vote rigging,
which involves ballot stuffing or stealing. Here we develop a statistical test
to quantify to which extent the results of a particular election display traces
of voter rigging. Our key hypothesis is that small polling stations are more
susceptible to voter rigging, because it is easier to identify opposing
individuals, there are less eye witnesses, and supposedly less visits from
election observers. We devise a general statistical method for testing whether
voting behavior in small polling stations is significantly different from the
behavior of their neighbor stations in a way that is consistent with the
widespread occurrence of voter rigging. Based on a comparative analysis, the
method enables to rule out whether observed differences in voting behavior
might be explained by geographic heterogeneities in vote preferences. We
analyze 21 elections in ten different countries and find significant anomalies
compatible with voter rigging in Russia from 2007-2011, in Venezuela from
2006-2013, and in Uganda 2011. Particularly disturbing is the case of Venezuela
where these distortions have been outcome-determinative in the 2013
presidential elections.

properties of the initial state formed in ultrarelativistic heavy-ion

Hadron Collider (LHC). We find that generically the predictions from wounded
quarks for such features as eccentricities or initial sizes are close (within
15\%) to predictions of the wounded nucleon model with an amended binary
component. A larger difference is found for the size in p+Pb system, where the
wounded quark model yields a smaller (more compact) initial fireball than the
standard wounded nucleon model. The inclusion of subnucleonic degrees of
freedom allows us to analyze p+p collisions in an analogous way, with
predictions that can be used in further collective evolution. The approximate
linear dependence of particle production in A+A collisions on the number of
wounded quarks, as found in previous studies, makes the approach based on
wounded quarks natural. Importantly, at the LHC energies we find approximate
uniformity in particle production from wounded quarks, where at a given
collision energy per nucleon pair similar production of initial entropy per
source is needed to explain the particle production from p+p collisions up to
A+A collisions. We also discuss the sensitivity of the wounded quark model
predictions to distribution of quarks in nucleons, distribution of nucleons in
nuclei, and to the quark-quark inelasticity profile in the impact parameter. In
our procedure, the quark-quark inelasticity profile is chosen in such a way
that the experiment-based parametrization of the proton-proton inelasticity
profile is properly reproduced. The parameters of the overlaid multiplicity

interferometry and lunar occultations. Accurate star diameters are now required
in the new field of exoplanet studies, since they condition the planets' sizes

  Our analysis is based on the modeling of the relationship between measured

concepts: a distance indicator called pseudomagnitude, and a quasi-experimental
observable that is independent of distance and specific to each star, called
the differential surface brightness (DSB). The use of all the published
measurements of apparent diameters that have been collected so far, and a
careful modeling of the DSB allow us to estimate star diameters with a median
statistical error of 1%, knowing their spectral type and, in the present case,
the VJHKs photometries.

simplicity close to that of structured grids and the flexibility of
unstructured grids while being highly suited for adaptive mesh refinement
(AMR). The developed DGTD-ACM achieves a desired accuracy by refining
non-conformal meshes near material interfaces to reduce stair-casing errors
without sacrificing the high efficiency afforded with uniform Cartesian meshes.
Moreover, DGTD-ACM can dynamically refine the mesh to resolve the local
variation of the fields during propagation of electromagnetic pulses. A local
time-stepping scheme is adopted to alleviate the constraint on the time-step
size due to the stability condition of the explicit time integration.
Simulations of electromagnetic wave diffraction over conducting and dielectric
cylinders and spheres demonstrate that the proposed method can achieve a good
numerical accuracy at a reduced computational cost compared with uniform
meshes. For simulations of dispersive media, the auxiliary differential
equation (ADE) and recursive convolution (RC) methods are implemented for a
local Drude model and tested for a cold plasma slab and a plasmonic rod. With
further advances of the charge transport models, the DGTD-ACM method is
expected to provide a powerful tool for computations of electromagnetic fields

that W was carried into the solar nebula by at least two distinct families of

distinct families were kept separate during the dust coagulation process, and
that the two families of grain interacted with the chondrule formation
mechanism differently. We take the co-existence of different families of solids
in the same general orbital region at the chondrule-precursor size as given,
and explore the requirements for them to have interacted with the chondrule
formation process at significantly different rates. We show that this sorting
of families of solids into chondrule and matrix destined dust had to have been
at least as powerful a sorting mechanism as the relative settling of
aerodynamically distinct grains at at least two scale heights above the
midplane. The requirement that the chondrule formation mechanism was correlated

stellar masses in normal groups, which appears to be a sign of the earlier
entry of the former into their groups. Nevertheless, the stellar population
properties of the SBGGs in LGGs are compatible with those of the general
population of galaxies with similar stellar masses residing in normal groups.

while their separate components have wildly varying abundances, bulk chondrites
have nearly solar composition. This implies that the nearly-solar reservoirs in
which chondrites were born were in turn assembled from sub-reservoirs of
differing compositions that birthed the different components. We focus on
explaining the potassium abundance variations between chondrules even within a
single chondrite, while maintaining the observed CI $^{41}$K to $^{39}$K
ratios. This requires physically separating potassium and chondrules while the
temperature is high enough for K to be in the gas phase. We examine several
mechanisms which could drive the dust through gas and show that to do so
locally would have required long (sub-orbital to many orbits) time scales; with
shortest potassium depletion time scales occurring in a scenario where
chondrules formed high above the midplane and settled out of the evaporated
potassium. While orbital time scales are at odds with laboratory chondrule
cooling rate estimates, any other model for the origin for the potassium
abundance variation has to wrestle with the severe logistical difficulty of
generating a plethora of correlated reservoirs which varied strongly in their
potassium abundances, but not in their potassium isotope ratios.

backgrounds and its relation to the speed of sound for tensor modes. A speed
different from one for tensor modes can arise in several contexts, such as
Galileons theories or massive gravity, nevertheless the speed is very
constrained to be one by observations of gravitational wave emission. It has
been shown that in inflation a disformal trans- formation allows to set the
speed for tensor modes to one without making changes to the curvature power
spectrum. Here we show that this invariance does not hold when considering the
CMB anisotropy power spectrum. It turns out that the after doing the
transformation there is an imprint on the acoustic peaks and the diffusion
damping. This has interesting consequences; here we explore quartic galileon
theories which allow a modified speed for tensor modes. For these theories the
transformation can be used to constraint the parameter space in different
regimes.

regarding the possibility of inter-conversion between matter and dark energy,
through some interaction of matter with the scalar field in the framework of
Brans-Dicke theory. The field equations for a spatially flat space-time have
been solved using an empirical dependence of scalar field parameter upon the
scale factor. To represent the behaviour regarding the non-conservation of
matter, a function, expressed in terms of the Hubble parameter, has been
empirically incorporated into the field equations. Their solution shows that,
this function, whose value is proportional to the matter content of the
universe, decreases monotonically with time. This matter-field interaction
generates late time acceleration, causing the deceleration parameter to change
its sign from positive to negative. Time dependence of the proportion of dark
energy component of the universe has been determined and shown graphically.
Time variation of gravitational constant and the Brans-Dicke dimensionless
parameter has been analyzed in the present study. The rate of generation of
dark energy from matter has been found to affect the time variations of

complex interplay of psychological and biological components, have become
increasingly popular in the recent psychopathological literature. These network
models often contain significant numbers of unknown parameters, yet the sample
sizes available in psychological research are limited. As such, general
assumptions about the true network are introduced to reduce the number of free
parameters. Incorporating these assumptions, however, means that the resulting
network will lead to reflect the particular structure assumed by the estimation
method---a crucial and often ignored aspect of psychopathological networks. For
example, observing a sparse structure and simultaneously assuming a sparse

this point, we discuss recent literature and show the effect of the assumption
of sparsity in three simulation studies.

increases, the radiofrequency technology has become a bottleneck in space
communications. RF is already limiting the scientific outcome of deep-space
missions and could be a significant obstacle in the developing of manned
missions. Lasercom holds the promise to solve this problem, as it will
considerably increase the data rate while decreasing the energy, mass and
volume of onboard communication systems. In RF deep-space communications, where
the received power is the main limitation, the traditional approach to boost
the data throughput has been increasing the receiver's aperture, e.g. the 70-m
antennas in the NASA's Deep Space Network. Optical communications also can
benefit from this strategy, thus 10-m class telescopes have typically been
suggested to support future deep-space links. However, the cost of big
telescopes increase exponentially with their aperture, and new ideas are needed
to optimize this ratio. Here, the use of ground-based gamma-ray telescopes,
known as Cherenkov telescopes, is suggested. These are optical telescopes
designed to maximize the receiver's aperture at a minimum cost with some
relaxed requirements. As they are used in an array configuration and multiple
identical units need to be built, each element of the telescope is designed to
minimize its cost. Furthermore, the native array configuration would facilitate
the joint operation of Cherenkov and lasercom telescopes. These telescopes
offer very big apertures, ranging from several meters to almost 30 meters,
which could greatly improve the performance of optical ground stations. The key
elements of these telescopes have been studied applied to lasercom, reaching
the conclusion that it could be an interesting strategy to include them in the
future development of an optical deep-space network.

experimental results, a family of graphene networks are constructed, and their

channels along the honeycomb axis and they are isolated from each other: one
type of channels is originated from the orbital interactions of the carbon

is from the straight lines of the carbon atoms that link the zigzag chains and
is topologically trivial. The velocity of the electrons can reach ~10^6 m/s.
Phonon transport in these allotropes is strongly anisotropic, and the thermal

of 15. Our calculations further indicate that these porous carbon networks
