not a panacea; it will expose new attack surfaces and vectors, just as it
enables new applications. We therefore urgently need a model of security in the
Internet of Things. In this regard, we note that IoT descends directly from
pre-existing research (in embedded Internet and pervasive intelligence), so
there exist several bodies of related work: security in RFID, sensor networks,
cyber-physical systems, and so on. In this paper, we survey the existing
literature on RFID and WSN security, as a step to compiling all known attacks
and defenses relevant to the Internet of Things.

service region, the bike usages can be quite skewed and imbalanced. Some
stations have too many incoming bikes and get jammed without enough docks for
upcoming bikes, while some other stations get empty quickly and lack enough
bikes for people to check out. Therefore, inferring the potential destinations

service providers schedule manual bike re-dispatch in advance. In this paper,

Between 2015 July 29 and 2015 September 27, operating in commensal mode, VLITE
imaged approximately 2800 pointings covering 12,000 deg$^2$ on the sky,
sampling timescales ranging from tens of seconds to several hours on a daily
basis. In addition, between 2015 February 25 and 2015 May 9, VLITE observed 55
epochs of roughly 2-4 hours each toward the COSMOS field. Using existing radio
source catalogs we have searched all the daily VLITE images for transients,
while for the COSMOS field we compared individual images and the summed image
to search for new sources in repeated observations of the same field. The wide
range of timescales makes VLITE sensitive to both coherent and incoherent
transient source classes. No new transients are found, allowing us to set
stringent upper limits on transients at milliJansky levels and at low
frequencies where comparatively few such surveys have been carried out to date.
An all-sky isotropic rate of bursting radio transients with similar rates,
duration, and intensity as the unusual transient GCRT J1745$-$3009, discovered
in wide-field monitoring toward the Galactic center, is ruled out with high
confidence. The resulting non-detections allows us to argue that this is a
coherent source, whose properties most resemble the growing class of nulling

chemical reactivity are strongly affected by crystal imperfections in the
atomically thin limit. Here, ultra-high vacuum (UHV) scanning tunneling
microscopy (STM) and spectroscopy (STS) are employed to interrogate point and
line defects in monolayer MoS2 grown on epitaxial graphene (EG) at the atomic
scale. Five types of point defects are observed with the majority species
showing apparent structures that are consistent with vacancy and interstitial
models. The total defect density is observed to be lower than MoS2 grown on
other substrates, and is likely attributed to the van der Waals epitaxy of MoS2
on EG. Grain boundaries (GBs) with 30{\deg} and 60{\deg} tilt angles resulting
from the rotational commensurability of MoS2 on EG are more easily resolved by
STM than atomic force microscopy at similar scales due to the enhanced contrast
from their distinct electronic states. For example, band gap reduction to ~0.8
eV and ~0.5 eV is observed with STS for 30{\deg} and 60{\deg} GBs,
respectively. In addition, atomic resolution STM images of these GBs are found

find an analytic solution to the mean-field model. By studying the phase space
flows, we determine the model's fixed points and their changes with parameters.
Phases previously identified for the single-lane model occur for low switching
rate between lanes. We predict a new multiple coexistence phase due to
additional fixed points that appear as the switching rate increases: switching
moves motors from the higher-density to the lower-density lane, causing local
jamming and creating multiple domain walls. We determine the phase diagram of
the model for both symmetric and general boundary conditions.

optimization of multi-agent systems, viewing them as stochastic hybrid systems.
Such systems often have feasible realizations in which the events needed to
excite an on-line event-driven controller cannot occur, rendering the use of
such controllers ineffective. We show that this commonly happens in
environments which contain discrete points of interest which the agents must
visit. To address this problem in event-driven gradient-based optimization
problems, we propose a new metric for the objective function which creates a
potential field guaranteeing that gradient values are non-zero when no events
are present and which results in eventual event excitation. We apply this
approach to the class of cooperative multi-agent data collection problems using
the event-driven Infinitesimal Perturbation Analysis (IPA) methodology and
include numerical examples illustrating its effectiveness.

chance for observing significant differences between treatment and control
covariate distributions increases with many covariates. Rerandomization
discards randomizations that do not satisfy a predetermined covariate balance
criterion, generally resulting in better covariate balance and more precise
estimates of causal effects. Previous theory has derived finite sample theory
for rerandomization under the assumptions of equal treatment group sizes,
Gaussian covariate and outcome distributions, or additive causal effects, but
not for the general sampling distribution of the difference-in-means estimator
for the average causal effect. To supplement existing results, we develop
asymptotic theory for rerandomization without these assumptions, which reveals
a non-Gaussian asymptotic distribution for this estimator, specifically a
linear combination of a Gaussian random variable and a truncated Gaussian
random variable. This distribution follows because rerandomization affects only
the projection of potential outcomes onto the covariate space but does not
affect the corresponding orthogonal residuals. We also demonstrate that,
compared to complete randomization, rerandomization reduces the asymptotic
sampling variances and quantile ranges of the difference-in-means estimator.
Moreover, our work allows the construction of accurate large-sample confidence
intervals for the average causal effect, thereby revealing further advantages
of rerandomization over complete randomization.

reduction when the underlying signals are sparse or compressible with respect
to some suitable basis or frame. One important, yet under-addressed problem
regarding the compressive acquisition of analog signals is how to perform
quantization. This is directly related to the important issues of how
""compressed"" compressed sensing is (in terms of the total number of bits one
ends up using after acquiring the signal) and ultimately whether compressed
sensing can be used to obtain compressed representations of suitable signals.
Building on our recent work, we propose a concrete and practicable method for
performing ""analog-to-information conversion"". Following a compressive signal
acquisition stage, the proposed method consists of a quantization stage, based
on $\Sigma\Delta$ (sigma-delta) quantization, and a subsequent encoding
(compression) stage that fits within the framework of compressed sensing
seamlessly. We prove that, using this method, we can convert analog compressive
samples to compressed digital bitstreams and decode using tractable algorithms
based on convex optimization. We prove that the proposed AIC provides a nearly
optimal encoding of sparse and compressible signals. Finally, we present
numerical experiments illustrating the effectiveness of the proposed
analog-to-information converter.

that Jackson integral measures for the polynomials of the big $q$-Jacobi family

of self-adjointness is achieved in an extended $\ell^2$ Hilbert space on which
a direct sum of two unbounded Jacobi matrices acts as a Hamiltonian or a
difference Schr\""odinger operator for an infinite dimensional eigenvalue
problem. The polynomial appearing in the upper/lower end of Jackson integral
constitutes the eigenvector of each of the two unbounded Jacobi matrix of the
direct sum. We also point out that the orthogonal vectors involving the
$q$-Meixner ($q$-Charlier) polynomials do not form a complete basis of the
$\ell^2$ Hilbert space, based on the fact that the dual $q$-Meixner polynomials
introduced in a previous paper fail to satisfy the orthogonality relation. The
complete set of eigenvectors involving the $q$-Meixner polynomials is obtained
by constructing the duals of the dual $q$-Meixner polynomials which require the
two component Hamiltonian formulation. An alternative solution method based on
the closure relation, the Heisenberg operator solution, is applied to the

disks in Cataclysmic Variable (CV) systems in order to investigate the relative
importance of angular momentum transport via turbulence driven by the
magnetorotational instability (MRI) compared to that driven by spiral shock
waves. Remarkably, we find that even with vigorous MRI turbulence, spiral
shocks are an important component to the overall angular momentum budget, at
least when temperatures in the disk are high (so that Mach numbers are low). In
order to understand the excitation, propagation, and damping of spiral density
waves in our simulations more carefully, we perform a series of 2D global
hydrodynamical simulations with various equation of states and both with and
without mass inflow via the Lagrangian point (L1). Compared with previous
similar studies, we find the following new results. 1) Linear wave dispersion
relation fits the pitch angles of spiral density waves very well. 2) We
demonstrate explicitly that mass accretion is driven by the deposition of
negative angular momentum carried by the waves when they dissipate in shocks.
3) Using Reynolds stress scaled by gas pressure to represent the effective
angular momentum transport rate alpha_{eff} is not accurate when mass accretion
is driven by non-axisymmetric shocks. 4) Using the mass accretion rate measured
in our simulations to directly measure alpha defined in standard thin-disk
theory, we find 0.02 < alpha_{eff} < 0.05 for CV disks, consistent with
observed values in quiescent states of dwarf novae (DNe). In this regime the
disk may be too cool and neutral for the MRI to operate and spiral shocks are a
possible accretion mechanism. However, we caution that our simulations use
unrealistically low Mach numbers in this regime, and therefore future models
with more realistic thermodynamics and non-ideal MHD are warranted.

shows that the phase diagram contains two distinct phases, the local moment
(LM) phase and the asymmetric strong coupling (ASC) phase. These results are
supported by the local spin and charge excitation spectra, which exhibit
qualitatively different behavior in these two phases and also reveal the
existence of the valence fluctuating point at the phase boundary. For
comparison, we also study the low-energy effective pseudogap Anderson model.
Although the high-energy excitations are obviously different, we find that the
ground state phase diagram and the asymptotically low-energy excitations are in
good quantitative agreement with those for the single impurity Anderson model
on the honeycomb lattice, thus providing the first quantitative justification
for the previous studies based on low-energy approximate approaches.
Furthermore, we find that the lowest entanglement level is doubly degenerate
for the LM phase, whereas it is singlet for the ASC phase and is accidentally
three fold degenerate at the valence fluctuating point. Our results therefore
clearly demonstrate that the low-lying entanglement spectrum can be used to
determine with high accuracy the phase boundary of the impurity quantum phase

a single water drop adhered to window glass is totally transparent and convex,
and thus optically acts like a fisheye lens. If we have more than one water
drop in a single image, then through each of them we can see the environment
with different view points, similar to stereo. To realize this idea, we need to
rectify every water drop imagery to make radially distorted planar surfaces
look flat. For this rectification, we consider two physical properties of water
drops: (1) A static water drop has constant volume, and its geometric convex
shape is determined by the balance between the tension force and gravity. This
implies that the 3D geometric shape can be obtained by minimizing the overall
potential energy, which is the sum of the tension energy and the gravitational
potential energy. (2) The imagery inside a water-drop is determined by the
water-drop 3D shape and total reflection at the boundary. This total reflection
generates a dark band commonly observed in any adherent water drops. Hence,
once the 3D shape of water drops are recovered, we can rectify the water drop
images through backward raytracing. Subsequently, we can compute depth using
stereo. In addition to depth estimation, we can also apply image refocusing.
Experiments on real images and a quantitative evaluation show the effectiveness
of our proposed method. To our best knowledge, never before have adherent water
drops been used to estimate depth.

{\it straintronics}. Various strain geometries have been proposed to produce
specific properties but their experimental realization has been limited.
Because strained folds can be engineered on graphene samples on appropriate
substrates, we study their effects on graphene transport properties. We show
the existence of an enhanced local density of states (LDOS) along the direction
of the strained fold that originates from localization of higher energy states,
and provides extra conductance channels at lower energies. In addition to
exhibit sublattice symmetry breaking, these states are valley polarized, with
quasi-ballistic properties in smooth disorder potentials. We confirmed that
these results persist in the presence of strong edge disorder, making these
geometries viable electronic waveguides. These findings could be tested in
properly engineered experimental settings.

tools in combinatorics. In this paper, we establish several results around the
regularity lemma. First, we prove that whether or not we include the condition
that the desired vertex partition in the regularity lemma is equitable has a
minimal effect on the number of parts of the partition. Second, we use an
algorithmic version of the (weak) Frieze--Kannan regularity lemma to give a
substantially faster deterministic approximation algorithm for counting
subgraphs in a graph. Previously, only an exponential dependence for the
running time on the error parameter was known, and we improve it to a
polynomial dependence. Third, we revisit the problem of finding an algorithmic
regularity lemma, giving approximation algorithms for several co-NP-complete
problems. We show how to use the weak Frieze--Kannan regularity lemma to
approximate the regularity of a pair of vertex subsets. We also show how to
quickly find, for each $\epsilon'>\epsilon$, an $\epsilon'$-regular partition
with $k$ parts if there exists an $\epsilon$-regular partition with $k$ parts.
Finally, we give a simple proof of the permutation regularity lemma which
improves the tower-type bound on the number of parts in the previous proofs to
a single exponential bound.

proposed algorithm minimizes data congestion and reduces energy consumption by
exploring spatio-temporal correlations among data samples. The adaptive
rate-distortion feature balances the compressed data size (data rate) with the
required error bound guarantee (distortion level). This compression relieves
the strain on energy and bandwidth resources while collecting WSN data within
tolerable error margins, thereby increasing the scale of WSNs. The algorithm is
evaluated using real-world datasets and compared with conventional methods for
temporal and spatial data compression. The experimental validation reveals that
the proposed algorithm outperforms several existing WSN data compression
methods in terms of compression efficiency and signal reconstruction. Moreover,
an energy analysis shows that compressing the data can reduce the energy

this paper to further improve the multiplexing gain for multiple input multiple

matrix in compressive sensing is employed before the traditional spatial
multiplexing in order to carry more data streams on the available spatial
multiplexing streams of the underlying MIMO system. At the receiver side, it is
proposed to reformulate the detection of the multiplexing signal into two
steps. In the first step, the traditional MIMO equalization can be used to
restore the transmitted spatial multiplexing signal of the MIMO system. While
in the second step, the standard optimization based detection algorithm assumed
in the compressive sensing framework is utilized to restore the CS multiplexing
data streams, wherein the exhaustive over-complete dictionary is used to
guarantee the sparse representation of the CS multiplexing signal. In order to
avoid the excessive complexity, the sub-block based dictionary and the
sub-block based CS restoration is proposed. Finally, simulation results are
presented to show the feasibility of the proposed CS based enhanced MIMO
multiplexing scheme. And our efforts in this paper shed some lights on the
great potential in further improving the spatial multiplexing gain for the MIMO

algebra can be realized by the two kinds of adjoint fermions. Each Kac-Moody
current of spin-1 is given by the product of fermions with structure constant
(f symbols) as usual. One can construct the spin-1 current by combining the
above two fermions with the structure constant and the spin-1 current by
multiplying these two fermions with completely symmetric SU(N) invariant tensor
of rank 3 (d symbols). The lowest higher spin-2 current with nonzero U(1)
charge (corresponding to the zeromode eigenvalue of spin-1 current of N=2
superconformal algebra) can be obtained from these four spin-1 currents in
quadratic form. Similarly, the other type of lowest higher spin-2 current,
whose U(1) charge is opposite to the above one, can be obtained also. Four
higher spin-5/2 currents can be constructed from the operator product
expansions (OPEs) between the spin-3/2 currents of N=2 superconformal algebra
and the above two higher spin-2 currents. The two higher spin-3 currents can be
determined by the OPEs between the above spin-3/2 currents and the higher

The evolution of a
dynamic complex system is typically represented as a sequence of snapshots,
where each snapshot describes the configuration of the system at a particular
instant of time. Then, one may directly follow how the snapshots evolve in
time, or aggregate the snapshots within some time intervals to form
representative ""slices"" of the evolution of the system configuration. This is
often done with constant intervals, whose duration is based on arguments on the
nature of the system and of its dynamics. A more refined approach would be to
consider the rate of activity in the system to perform a separation of
timescales. However, an even better alternative would be to define dynamic
intervals that match the evolution of the system's configuration. To this end,
we propose a method that aims at detecting evolutionary changes in the
configuration of a complex system, and generates intervals accordingly. We show
that evolutionary timescales can be identified by looking for peaks in the
similarity between the sets of events on consecutive time intervals of data.
Tests on simple toy models reveal that the technique is able to detect
evolutionary timescales of time-varying data both when the evolution is smooth
as well as when it changes sharply. This is further corroborated by analyses of
several real datasets. Our method is scalable to extremely large datasets and
is computationally efficient. This allows a quick, parameter-free detection of
multiple timescales in the evolution of a complex system.

parity-check matrix such that no submatrix forms an $(a,b)$-trapping set. This
concept was first introduced in the context of low-density parity-check (LDPC)
codes in an attempt to estimate the number of redundant rows in a parity-check
matrix suitable for iterative decoding. Essentially the same concepts appear in
other contexts as well such as robust syndrome extraction for quantum error
correction. Among the known upper bounds on the trapping redundancy, the
strongest one was proposed by employing a powerful tool in probabilistic
combinatorics, called the Lov\'{a}sz Local Lemma. Unfortunately, the proposed
proof invoked this tool in a situation where an assumption made in the lemma
does not necessarily hold. Hence, although we do not doubt that nonetheless the
proposed bound actually holds, for it to be a mathematical theorem, a more
rigorous proof is desired. Another disadvantage of the proposed bound is that
it is only applicable to $(a,b)$-trapping sets with rather small $a$. Here, we
give a more general and sharper upper bound on trapping redundancy by making
mathematically more rigorous use of probabilistic combinatorics without relying
on the lemma. Our bound is applicable to all potentially avoidable
$(a,b)$-trapping sets with $a$ smaller than the minimum distance of a given
linear code, while being generally much sharper than the bound through the
Lov\'{a}sz Local Lemma. In fact, our upper bound is sharp enough to exactly
determine the trapping redundancy for many cases, thereby providing precise
knowledge in the form of a more general bound with mathematical rigor.

with a given C0-semigroup its so-called interpolation and extrapolation spaces.
In the model case of the shift semigroup acting on L^2(R), the resulting chain
of spaces recovers the classical Sobolev scale. In 2014, the second named
author defined the universal interpolation space as the projective limit of the
interpolation spaces and the universal extrapolation space as the completion of
the inductive limit of the extrapolation spaces, provided that the latter is
Hausdorff.
  In this note we use the notion of the dual with respect to a pivot space in
order to show that the aforementioned inductive limit is Hausdorff, already
complete, and can be represented as the dual of the projective limit whenever a
power of the generator of the initial semigroup is a self-adjoint operator. In
the case of the classical Sobolev scale we show that the duality holds, and
that the two universal spaces were already studied by Laurent Schwartz in the
1950s.
  Our results and examples complement the approach of Haase, who in 2006 gave a
different definition of universal extrapolation spaces in the context of
functional calculi. Haase avoids the inductive limit topology precisely for the
reason that it a priori cannot be guaranteed that the latter is always
Hausdorff. We show that this is indeed the case provided that we start with a
semigroup defined on a reflexive Banach space.

time and space. Recently, stochastic bedload transport theories have been
developed to address the mechanisms and effects of bedload transport
fluctuations. Stochastic models involve parameters such as particle
diffusivity, entrainment and deposition rates. The lack of hard information on
how these parameters vary with flow conditions is a clear impediment to their
application to real-world scenarios. In this paper, we determined the closure
equations for the above parameters from laboratory experiments. We focused on
shallow supercritical flow on a sloping mobile bed in straight channels, a
setting that was representative of flow conditions in mountain rivers.
Experiments were run at low sediment transport rates under steady nonuniform
flow conditions (i.e., the water discharge was kept constant, but bedforms
developed and migrated upstream, making flow nonuniform). Using image
processing, we reconstructed particle paths to deduce the particle velocity and
its probability distribution, particle diffusivity, and rates of deposition and
entrainment. We found that on average, particle acceleration, velocity and
deposition rate were responsive to local flow conditions, whereas entrainment
rate depended strongly on local bed activity. Particle diffusivity varied
linearly with the depth-averaged flow velocity. The empirical probability
distribution of particle velocity was well approximated by a Gaussian
distribution when all particle positions were considered together. In contrast,
the particles located in close vicinity to the bed had exponentially
distributed velocities. Our experimental results provide closure equations for
stochastic or deterministic bedload transport models.

quantum observables that cannot be measured simultaneously. This
incompatibility of quantum observables is a necessary ingredient in several
quantum phenomena, such as measurement uncertainty relations, violation of Bell
inequalities and steering. Two quantum observables that admit a simultaneous
measurement are, in this respect, classical. A finer classification of
classicality can be made by formulating four symmetric relations on the set of
observables that are stronger than compatibility; they are broadcastability,
one-side broadcastability, mutual nondisturbance and nondisturbance. It is
proven that the five relations form a hierarchy, and their differences in terms
of the required devices needed in a simultaneous measurement is explained. All
the four relations stronger than compatibility are completely characterized in
the case of qubit observables.

the fluid. Linear stability analysis shows that solids settling in the Epstein
drag regime would remain homogeneously distributed in non-rotating
incompressible fluids, even when dust-to-gas ratios reach unity. However, the
non-linear evolution has not been probed before. Here, we present numerical
calculations indicating that in a particle-dense mixture solids spontaneously
mix out of the fluid and form swarms overdense in particles by at least a
factor 10. The instability is caused by mass-loaded regions locally breaking
the equilibrium background stratification. The driving mechanism depends on
non-linear perturbations of the background flow and shares some similarity to
the streaming instability in accretion discs. The resulting particle-rich
swarms may stimulate particle growth by coagulation. In the context of
protoplanetary discs, the instability could be relevant for aiding small
particles to settle to the midplane in the outer disc. Inside the gas envelopes
of protoplanets, enhanced settling may lead to a reduced dust opacity, which
facilitates the contraction of the envelope. We show that the relevant physical
set up can be recreated in a laboratory setting. This will allow our numerical

emission alternate with flares of individual features of the 22 GHz water
maser. High angular resolution data reveal that a few components of both maser
species showing periodic behaviour coincide in position and velocity and all
the periodic water maser components appear in the methanol maser region of size
of 360 au. The maser flares could be caused by variations in the infrared
radiation field induced by cyclic accretion instabilities in a circumstellar or
protobinary disc. The observations do not support either the stellar pulsations
or the seed photon flux variations as the underlying mechanisms of the

a short-range attraction between the medium particles and the heavier probe,
all immersed in an equilibrium thermal bath. For no or small rotation force on
the medium particles, the origin is an unstable fixed point for the probe and
the precise shape of the self-potential at large distances from the origin is
irrelevant for the statistical force there. Above a certain rotation threshold,
while the medium particles are still repelled from the origin, the probe
stabilizes there and more details of the medium-density at large distance start
to matter. The effect is robust around the quasi-static limit with rotation
threshold only weakly depending on the temperature but the stabilization gets

erupting flux rope, studied its properties, and detected wave signatures inside
the developing CME. These findings have allowed us to establish new features in
the genesis of the CME and associated EUV wave and to reconcile all of the
episodes into a causally-related sequence. (1) A hot 11 MK flux rope developed
from a compact filament, accelerated up to 3 km/s$^2$ 1 min before a hard X-ray
burst and earlier than other structures, reached 420 km/s, and decelerated to
50 km/s. (2) The CME development was driven by the flux rope. Closed structures
above the rope got sequentially involved in the expansion from below upwards,
came closer together, and disappeared to reveal their envelope, the rim, which
became the outer boundary of the cavity. The rim was associated with the
separatrix surface of a magnetic domain, which contained the pre-eruptive
filament. (3) The rim formation was associated with a successive compression of
the upper active-region structures into the CME frontal structure (FS). When
the rim was formed, it resembled a piston. (4) The disturbance responsible for
the CME formation was excited by the flux rope inside the rim, and then
propagated outward. EUV structures at different heights started to accelerate,
when their trajectories in the distance-time diagram were crossed by the front
of this disturbance. (5) Outside the rim and FS, the disturbance propagated
like a blast wave, manifesting in a type II radio burst and a leading part of
the EUV transient. Its main, trailing part was the FS, which consisted of
swept-up 2 MK loops enveloping the rim. The wave decelerated and decayed soon,
being not driven by the trailing piston, which slowed down.

nanocrystals are known to form liquid crystals often exhibiting a helical
supramolecular organization. Little is known about the microscopic origin, size
and handedness of the helical pitch in these, so-called cholesteric phases.
Experimental observations in chiral lyotropics suggest that long-ranged chiral
forces of electrostatic origin acting between the mesogens are responsible for
such organization. Using large-scale computer simulation we study the
sensitivity of the pitch imparted by soft microscopic helices and confirm that
the helical sense is sensitive to a change of packing fraction, magnitude of
the molecular pitch and amplitude of the chiral interactions. In particular, we
find evidence that the cholesteric helix sense may change spontaneously upon
variation of particle density, at fixed molecular chirality. These pitch
inversions have been reported in recent theoretical studies but simulation
evidence remains elusive. We rationalize these sudden changes in the
supramolecular helical symmetry on the basis of detailed measurements of the
mean-torque generated by the twisting of the helices. The simulation
methodology employed does not require confining the twisted nematic in a slab
geometry and allows for a simultaneous measurement of the pitch and the twist
elastic constant. We find that the twist elastic constant increases almost
linearly with density suggesting that twisted nematic shows no signs of
anomalous stiffening due to pre-smectic fluctuations at higher packing
fraction.

proxy data. This calibration is usually achieved by means of linear regression
models. In the recent paleo-climate literature there is an ongoing discussion
on the validity of highly resolved climate reconstructions. The reason for this
is that the proxy data are noisy, i.e. in addition to the variability that is
related to the climate variable of interest, they contain other sources of
variability. Inadequate treatment of such noise leads to a biased estimation of
regression slopes, resulting in a wrong representation of the real amplitude of
past climate variations. Methods to overcome this problem have had a limited
success so far. Here, we present a new approach - SINOMA - for noisy serial
data streams that are characterized by different spectral characteristics of
signal and noise. SINOMA makes use of specific properties of the data streams
temporal or spatial structure and by this is able to deliver a precise estimate
of the true regression slope and, simultaneously, of the ratio of noise
variances present in the predictor and predictand. The paper introduces the
underlying mathematics as well as a general description of the presented
algorithm. The validity of SINOMA is illustrated with two test data-sets.
Finally we address methodological limitations and further potential
applications.

with Alzheimer's disease, is an amphiphatic peptide with a high propensity to
self-assemble. A$\beta$42 has a net negative charge at physiological pH and
modulations of intermolecular electrostatic interactions can significantly
alter its aggregation behaviour. Variations in sequence and solution conditions
lead to varied macroscopic behaviour, often resulting in a number of different
mechanistic explanations for the aggregation of these closely related systems.
Here we alter the electrostatic interactions governing the fibril aggregation
kinetics by varying the ionic strength over an order of magnitude, which allows
us to sample the space of different reaction mechanisms, and develop a minimal
reaction network that explains the experimental kinetics under all the
different conditions. We find that an increase in the ionic strength leads to
an increased rate of surface catalysed nucleation over fragmentation and
eventually to a saturation of this nucleation process. More generally, this
reaction network connects previously separate systems, such as mutants of
A$\beta$42 and the wild type, on a continuous mechanistic landscape, thereby
providing a unified picture of the aggregation mechanism of A$\beta$42 and the
means of directly comparing the effects of intrinsic modifications of the

full stops that determine the length of sentences are the main carrier of

Zipf rank-frequency plots as well as study their role in the word-adjacency

reveal properties that are qualitatively similar to the properties of the most
frequent words like articles, conjunctions, pronouns, and prepositions. This
refers to both the Zipfian analysis and the network analysis. By adding the
punctuation marks to the Zipf plots, we also show that these plots that are

transition between seemingly distinct configurations of multi-instantons occur
as moduli changes in the non-BPS solutions, and the simplest non-BPS exact
solution corresponds to multi-bion configurations with fully-compressed double
fractional instantons in the middle. It indicates that the non-BPS solutions
make small but nonzero contribution to the resurgent trans-series as special
cases of the multi-bion configurations. We observe a generic pattern of
transitions between distinct multi-bion configurations (flipping partners),
leading to the three essential properties of the non-BPS exact solution: (i)
opposite sign for terms corresponding to the left and right infinities, (ii)
symmetric location of fractional instantons, and (iii) the transition between
distinct bion configurations. By studying the balance of forces, we show that
the relative phases between the instanton constituents play decisive roles in
stability and instability of the muli-instanton configurations. We discuss
local and global instabilities of the solutions such as negative modes and the
flow to the other saddle points, by considering the deformations of the non-BPS
exact solutions within our multi-instanton ansatz. We also briefly discuss some

wall-bounded flows and present recent achievements in the understanding of this
problem. The transition is abrupt with laminar-turbulent coexistence over a
finite range of Reynolds numbers, the transitional range. The archetypical
cases of Poiseuille pipe flow and plane Couette flow are first reviewed at the
phenomenological level, together with a few other flow configurations.
Theoretical approaches are then examined with particular emphasis on the
existence of special nontrivial solutions to the Navier-Stokes equations at
finite distance from laminar flow. Dynamical systems theory is most appropriate
to analyze their role, in particular with respect to the transient character of
turbulence in the lower transitional range. The extensions needed to deal with
the prominent spatiotemporal features of the transition are then discussed.
Turbulence growth/decay in terms of statistical physics of many-body systems
and the relevance of directed percolation as a stochastic process able to
account for it are next scrutinized. To conclude, we advocate the recourse to
well-designed modeling able to provide us with a conceptually coherent picture
of the full transitional range and put forward some open issues.

non-commutative geometry (NCG): we explain its mathematical advantages and its
success in capturing the structure of the standard model of particle physics.
The idea, in brief, is to represent $A$ (the algebra of differential forms on
some possibly-noncommutative space) on $H$ (the Hilbert space of spinors on
that space), and to reinterpret this representation as a simple super-algebra
$B=A\oplus H$ with even part $A$ and odd part $H$. $B$ is the fundamental
object in our approach: we show that (nearly) all of the basic axioms and
assumptions of the traditional real-spectral-triple formalism of NCG are
elegantly recovered from the simple requirement that $B$ should be a
differential graded $\ast$-algebra (or ""$\ast$-DGA""). Moreover, this
requirement also yields other, new, geometrical constraints. When we apply our
formalism to the NCG traditionally used to describe the standard model of
particle physics, we find that these new constraints are physically meaningful
and phenomenologically correct. In particular, these new constraints provide a
novel interpretation of electroweak symmetry breaking that is geometric rather
than dynamical. This formalism is more restrictive than effective field theory,
and so explains more about the observed structure of the standard model, and
offers more guidance about physics beyond the standard model.

relativistic systems. In particular, the type-II Weyl fermions may emerge
behind the event horizon of black holes. In this case the horizon with
Painleve-Gullstrand metric serves as the surface of the Lifshitz transition.
This relativistic analogy allows us to simulate the black hole horizon and
Hawking radiation using the fermionic superfluid with supercritical velocity,
and the Dirac and Weyl semimetals with the interface separating the type-I and
type-II states. The difference between such type of the artificial event
horizon and that which arises in acoustic metric is discussed. At the Lifshitz
transition between type-I and type-II fermions the Dirac lines may also emerge,
which are supported by the combined action of topology and symmetry. The
type-II Weyl and Dirac points also emerge as the intermediate states of the
topological Lifshitz transitions. Different configurations of the Fermi
surfaces, involved in such Lifshitz transition, are discussed. In one case the
type-II Weyl point connects the Fermi pockets, and the Lifshitz transition
corresponds to the transfer of the Berry flux between the Fermi pockets. In the
other case the type-II Weyl point connects the outer and inner Fermi surfaces.
At the Lifshitz transition the Weyl point is released from both Fermi surfaces.
These examples reveal the complexity and universality of topological Lifshitz
transitions, which originate from the ubiquitous interplay of a variety of
topological characters of the momentum-space manifolds. For the interacting
electrons, the Lifshitz transitions may lead to the formation of the
dispersionless (flat) band with zero energy and singular density of states,
which opens the route to room-temperature superconductivity.

degenerate perturbation theory in Floquet space. We find that below a threshold
driving strength, interband excitations are suppressed exponentially with
respect to the inverse driving frequency. For sufficiently low frequencies,
this leads to a rather sudden onset of interband heating, once the driving
strength reaches the threshold. We argue that this behavior is rather generic
and should also be found in lattice systems that are driven by other forms of
periodic forcing. Our results are relevant for Floquet engineering, where a
lattice system is driven periodically in time in order to endow it with novel
properties like the emergence of a strong artificial magnetic field or a
topological band structure. In this context, interband excitation processes

the resolution performance among different types of signals is improved.

contacts between two bodies are alternately formed and sheared as the bodies

smooth, classical friction goes to zero, a state called superlubricity. In this
limit, much weaker mechanisms, called quantum friction are predicted. These
mechanisms are based on an exchange of elementary excitations between two

the excitations must arise from the quantum mechanical description of the
bodies. Photons and phonons are such excitations. Friction results from an
irreversible momentum transfer from these excitations to the bodies, affecting
their motion. We measured the friction force between crystallites of solid 4He

the states of the vehicle's immediate predecessor and follower. The coupling
towards the preceding vehicle can be chosen different to the coupling towards
the following vehicle, which is often referred to as an asymmetric
bidirectional string. Further, the asymmetry for the velocity coupling can be
chosen differently to the asymmetry in the position coupling. It is
investigated how the effect of disturbance on the control errors in the string
depends on the string length. It is shown, that in case of symmetric position
coupling and asymmetric velocity coupling, linear scaling can be achieved. For
symmetric interaction in both states, i.e., in symmetric bidirectional strings,
the errors scale quadratically in the number of vehicles. When the coupling in
position is asymmetric, exponential scaling may occur or the system might even
become unstable. The paper thus gives a comprehensive overview of the
achievable performance in linear, asymmetric, bidirectional platoons. The
results reveal that symmetry in the position coupling and asymmetry in velocity
coupling qualitatively improves the performance of the string. Extensive
numerical results illustrate the theoretical findings.

graphs with large minimum degree and without a large ``bipartite hole`` (two
disjoint sets of vertices with no edges between them). This result extends
Dirac's classical theorem, and is related to a theorem of Chv\'atal and
Erd\H{o}s.
  In detail, an $(s, t)$-bipartite-hole in a graph $G$ consists of two disjoint
sets of vertices $S$ and $T$ with $|S|= s$ and $|T|=t$ such that there are no
edges between $S$ and $T$; and $\widetilde{\alpha}(G)$ is the maximum integer
$r$ such that $G$ contains an $(s, t)$-bipartite-hole for every pair of
non-negative integers $s$ and $t$ with $s + t = r$. Our central theorem is that
a graph $G$ with at least $3$ vertices is Hamiltonian if its minimum degree is
at least $\widetilde{\alpha}(G)$.
  From the proof we obtain a polynomial time algorithm that either finds a
Hamilton cycle or a large bipartite hole. The theorem also yields a condition
for the existence of $k$ edge-disjoint Hamilton cycles. We see that for dense
random graphs $G(n,p)$, the probability of failing to contain many
edge-disjoint Hamilton cycles is $(1 - p)^{(1 + o(1))n}$. Finally, we discuss
the complexity of calculating and approximating $\widetilde{\alpha}(G)$.

  Small fixes and improvements following referee report",,,,"math.DS math.GR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Let $G$ and $H$ be infinite finitely generated amenable groups. This paper
studies two notions of equivalence between actions of such groups on standard
Borel probability spaces. They are defined as stable orbit equivalences in
which the associated cocycles satisfy certain tail bounds. In `integrable
stable orbit equivalence', the length in $H$ of the cocycle-image of an element
of $G$ must have finite integral over its domain (a subset of the $G$-system),
and similarly for the reverse cocycle. In `bounded stable orbit equivalence',
these functions must be essentially bounded in terms of the length in $G$.
`Integrable' stable orbit equivalence arises naturally in the study of
integrable measure equivalence of groups themselves, as introduced recently by
Bader, Furman and Sauer.
  The main result is a formula relating the Kolmogorov--Sinai entropies of two
actions which are equivalent in one of these ways. Under either of these tail
assumptions, the entropies stand in a proportion given by the compression
constant of the stable orbit equivalence. In particular, in the case of full
orbit equivalence subject to such a tail bound, entropy is an invariant. This
contrasts with the case of unrestricted orbit equivalence, under which all free
ergodic actions of countable amenable groups are equivalent. The proof uses an
entropy-bound based on graphings for orbit equivalence relations, and in
particular on a new notion of cost which is weighted by the word lengths of
group elements.

$\mathcal N=4$ SYM and present new results for its higher-order perturbative
expansion. We study two different limits with respect to the cusp angle $\phi$.
The first is the light-like regime where $x = e^{i\,\phi}\to 0$. This limit is
characterised by a non-trivial expansion of the cusp anomaly as a sum of powers
of $\log x$, where the maximum exponent increases with the loop order. The
coefficients of this expansion have remarkable transcendentality features and
can be expressed by products of single zeta values. We show that the whole
logarithmic expansion is fully captured by a solvable Woods-Saxon like
one-dimensional potential. From the exact solution, we extract generating
functions for the cusp anomaly as well as for the various specific
transcendental structures appearing therein. The second limit that we discuss
is the regime of small cusp angle. In this somewhat simpler case, we show how
to organise the quantum mechanical perturbation theory in a novel efficient way
by means of a suitable all-order Ansatz for the ground state of the associated
Schr\""odinger problem. Our perturbative setup allows to systematically derive
higher-order perturbative corrections in powers of the cusp angle as explicit
non-perturbative functions of the effective coupling. This series approximation
is compared with the numerical solution of the Schr\""odinger equation to show
that we can achieve very good accuracy over the whole range of coupling and
cusp angle. Our results have been obtained by relatively simple techniques.
Nevertheless, they provide several non-trivial tests useful to check the
application of Quantum Spectral Curve methods to the ladder approximation at
non zero $\phi$, in the two limits we studied.

changes in the magnification ratio can be caused by microlensing on
intermediate size structures in the lensing galaxy. We investigate in details
three classes of possible lenses: globular clusters (GC), open clusters (OC)
and giant molecular clouds (GMC). We apply this scenario to the case of QSO
B0218+357. Our numerical simulations show that changes in magnifi- cations with
similar time scales can be obtained for relativistically moving emission
regions with sizes up to 0.01 pc in the case of microlensing on the cores of
GCs or clumps in GMCs. From the density of such structures in spiral galaxies
we estimate however that lensing in giant molecular clouds would be more
common.

probability density function (PDF) is introduced as a powerful statistical tool
to study and compare the transverse Anderson localization properties of a
disordered one dimensional optical waveguide. Second, by analyzing the scaling
properties of the mode-width PDF with the transverse size of the waveguide, it
is shown that the mode-width PDF gradually converges to a terminal
configuration. Therefore, it may not be necessary to study a real-sized
disordered structure in order to obtain its statistical localization properties
and the same PDF can be obtained for a substantially smaller structure. This
observation is important because it can reduce the often demanding
computational effort that is required to study the statistical properties of
Anderson localization in disordered waveguides. Using the mode-width PDF,
substantial information about the impact of the waveguide parameters on its
localization properties is extracted. This information is generally obscured
when disordered waveguides are analyzed using other techniques such as the beam
propagation method. As an example of the utility of the mode-width PDF, it is
shown that the cladding refractive index can be used to quench the number of
extended modes, hence improving the contrast in image transport properties of
disordered waveguides.

biomarkers in order to monitor progression and identify potential points of
intervention. This is especially important for neurodegenerative diseases, as
therapeutic intervention is most likely to be effective in the preclinical
disease stages prior to significant neuronal damage. Longitudinal neuroimaging
allows for the measurement of structural, functional, and metabolic integrity
of the brain over time at the level of voxels. However, commonly used
longitudinal analysis approaches, such as linear mixed effects models, do not
account for the fact that individuals enter a study at various disease stages
and progress at different rates, and generally consider each voxelwise measure
independently. We propose a multivariate nonlinear mixed effects model for
estimating the trajectories of voxelwise neuroimaging biomarkers from
longitudinal data that accounts for such differences across individuals. The
method involves the prediction of a progression score for each visit based on a
collective analysis of voxelwise biomarker data within an
expectation-maximization framework that efficiently handles large amounts of
measurements and variable number of visits per individual, and accounts for
spatial correlations among voxels. This score allows individuals with similar
progressions to be aligned and analyzed together, which enables the
construction of a trajectory of brain changes as a function of an underlying
progression or disease stage. Application of our method to studying images of
beta-amyloid deposition, a hallmark of preclinical Alzheimer's disease,
suggests that precuneus is the earliest cortical region to accumulate amyloid.
The proposed method can be applied to other types of longitudinal imaging data,
including metabolism, blood flow, tau, and structural imaging-derived measures.

spectrums of X-ray binaries. Currently it is not possible to unambiguously
differentiate the large number of proposed models to explain these phenomena
through existing observations.
  Aims. We investigate the observable predictions of a simple model that
generates flux modulation: a spiral instability rotating in a thin accretion
disk. This model is motivated by the accretion ejection instability (AEI) model
for low- frequency QPOs (LFQPOs). We are particularly interested in the
inclination dependence of the observables that are associated with this model.
  Methods. We develop a simple analytical model of an accretion disk, which
features a spiral instability. The disk is assumed to emit blackbody radiation,
which is ray-traced to a distant observer. We compute pulse profiles and power
spectra as observed from infinity.
  Results. We show that the amplitude of the modulation associated with the
spiral rotation is a strong function of inclination and frequency. The pulse
profile is quasi-sinusoidal only at low inclination (face-on source). As a
consequence, a higher-inclination geometry leads to a stronger and more diverse
harmonic signature in the power spectrum.
  Conclusions. We present how the amplitude depends on the inclination when the
flux modulation comes from a spiral in the disk. We also include new
observables that could potentially differentiate between models, such as the
pulse profile and the harmonic content of the power spectra of high-inclination
sources that exhibit LFQPOs. These might be important observables to explore
with existing and new instruments.

unimodularity of the color group $SU(3)$ and on the existence of 3 generations,
we develop an argumentation suggesting that the ""finite quantum space""
corresponding to the exceptional real Jordan algebra of dimension 27 (the
Euclidean Albert algebra) is relevant for the description of internal spaces in
the theory of particles. In particular, the triality which corresponds to the 3
off-diagonal octonionic elements of the exceptional algebra is associated to
the 3 generations of the Standard Model while the representation of the
octonions as a complex 4-dimensional space $\mathbb C\oplus\mathbb C^3$ is
associated to the quark-lepton symmetry, (one complex for the lepton and 3 for
the corresponding quark). More generally it is is suggested that the
replacement of the algebra of real functions on spacetime by the algebra of
functions on spacetime with values in a finite-dimensional Euclidean Jordan
algebra which plays the role of ""the algebra of real functions"" on the
corresponding almost classical quantum spacetime is relevant in particle
physics. This leads us to study the theory of Jordan modules and to develop the
differential calculus over Jordan algebras, (i.e. to introduce the appropriate
notion of differential forms). We formulate the corresponding definition of
connections on Jordan modules.

physicochemical processes were responsible for the creation of cracking
patterns on the charring wood surface. This implied no possibility to
rigorously explain the crack topology. In this paper we show instead that below
the pyrolysis temperatures, a primary global macro-crack pattern is already
completely established by means of a thermomechanical instability phenomenon.
First we report experimental observations of the crack patterns on orthotropic
(wood) and isotropic (Medium Density Fibreboard) materials in inert atmosphere.
Then we solve the 3D thermomechanical buckling problem numerically by using the
Finite Element Method, and show that the different crack topologies can be
explained qualitatively by the simultaneous thermal expansion and softening,
taking into account the directional dependence of the elastic properties.
Finally, we formulate a 2D model for a soft layer bonded to an elastic
substrate, and find an equation predicting the inter-crack distance in the main
crack-pattern for the orthotropic case. We also derive a formula for the
critical thermal stress above which the plane surface will wrinkle and buckle.
The results can be used for finding new ways to prevent or delay the crack
formation, leading to improved fire safety of wood-based products.

composite plates characterized by a thickness variation. Layer interfaces are
described as functions of inplane coordinates. Top and bottom surfaces of the
plate are symmetric about the midplane and the plate could be considered as a
flat surface in analysis along with thickness parameters which vary over the
plate. The variable thickness at a certain position in the midplane is modeled
by a set of control points (or thickness-parameters) through NURBS (Non-Uniform
Rational B-Spline) basic functions. The knot parameter space which is referred
in modelling geometry and approximating displacement variables is employed for
approximating thickness, simultaneously. The use of quadratic NURBS functions
results in C^1 continuity of modeling variable thickness and analyzing
solutions. Thin to moderately thick laminates in bound of first-order shear
deformation theory (FSDT) are taken into account. Strain-displacement relations
in sense of von-Karman theory are employed for large deformation. Riks method
is used for geometrically nonlinear analysis. The weak form is approximated
numerically by the isogeometric analysis (IGA), which has been found to be a
robust, stable and realistic numerical tool. Numerical results confirm the

present several examples of how obtaining cosmological magnetic seed fields as
galactic magnetic fields from massive neutrino densities and also from the
torsion obtained by Nitsch as $T\approx{10^{-24}s^{-1}}$ at the present day
which yields magnetic seed field of the order of $B_{seed}\approx{10^{-12}G}$.
In the case we use torsion derived from massive neutrinos given by
$T_{\nu}\approx{10^{-26}s^{-1}}$ one obtains in BBN time $t\approx{1s}$ with
the primordial nucleosynthesis magnetic field given by
$B_{BBN}\approx{10^{11}G}$ a relic magnetic field $B_{c}\approx{10^{39}G}$
which shows that the result obtained by Enqvist et al for the cosmological
fields at the early universe. Galactic dynamo seed could be obtained from
neutrinos at recombination. It is also shown that in the approximation of weak
fields torsion can slow down the decay of magnetic fields which confirms
previous results. At Planck era where the time is $t\sim{10^{-43}s}$ and
$B_{Pl}\sim{10^{58}G}$ the use of formula with the strongest torsion
$10^{-19}G$this yields $B_{seed}\sim{10^{-4}G}$ is a too strong field to

analog-to-digital converter (TIPADC) and analyze its linear, nonlinear, and
noise performance. The basic operation mechanism of TIPADC is illustrated and
the linear performance is analyzed in frequency domain. The mathematical
expressions and the output of the system are presented in each processing step.
We reveal that photonic sampling folds the whole spectrum of input signal in a
narrow band, which enables the analog bandwidth of a TIPADC to be much higher
than the bandwidth of back-end electronics. The feasible regions of the system
is obtained in terms of system frequency response, and a set of sampling
criteria determining the basic requirements to the system are summarized for
typical applications. The results show that the global minimum feasible
bandwidth of back-end electronics is the half of single channel sampling rate
when the bandwidth of photonic sampling pulse is comparable to input signal
frequency. The amplitude and phase noise of photonic sampling pulse train, the
thermal noise and shot noise of photodetection, and the quantization noise and
aperture jitter noise of EADCs are investigated. The nonlinearity of TIPADC is
also analyzed. The effect of different factors, such as the single channel
sampling rate, the average optical power and the bandwidth of back-end
electronics, on the effective number of bits of TIPADC is qualitatively and
quantitatively discussed. The results explicitly show that TIPADC can perform
high fidelity conversion to ultra-high speed analog signal and overcome the
major performance limitations existing in traditional ADCs such as aperture
jitter and bandwidth. The criteria deduced will be an effective supplement to
the generalized sampling theorem in designing TIPADC.

investigate conditional response probabilities in Murdock's 40-1 (1962) free
recall dataset. I find that the conditional response probabilities confirm the
presence of two stages. The first stage is characterized by a large enhancement
of the forward subsequent recall (up to 30 times chance) and a large
suppression of backward recalls (up to 26 times smaller than chance for recalls
between 10 and 40 items away). The second stage forward subsequent recall is
enhanced by a factor of 5 and the probability of backward and forward recalls
are concentrated at small distances. Thus both stages favor forward subsequent
