  Model Predictive Control",,,,,"math.OC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Projected Gradient Descent denotes a class of iterative methods for solving
optimization programs. Its applicability to convex optimization programs has
gained significant popularity for its intuitive implementation that involves
only simple algebraic operations. In fact, if the projection onto the feasible
set is easy to compute, then the method has low complexity. On the other hand,
when the problem is nonconvex, e.g. because of nonlinear equality constraints,
the projection becomes hard and thus impractical. In this paper, we propose a
projected gradient method for Nonlinear Programs (NLPs) that only requires
projections onto the linearization of the nonlinear constraints around the
current iterate, similarly to Sequential Quadratic Programming (SQP). Although
the projection is easier to compute, it makes the intermediate steps unfeasible
for the original problem. As a result, the gradient method does not fall either
into the projected gradient descent approaches, because the projection is not
performed onto the original nonlinear manifold, or into the standard SQP, since
second-order information is not used. For nonlinear smooth optimization
problems, we analyze the similarities of the proposed method with SQP and
assess its local and global convergence to a Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) point of
the original problem. Further, we show that nonlinear Model Predictive Control
(MPC) is a promising application of the proposed method, due to the sparsity of
the resulting optimization problem. We illustrate the computational efficiency
of the proposed method in a numerical example with box constraints on the
control input and a quadratic terminal constraint on the state variable.

logarithm of the Dedekind eta function. This eta function is a weight $1/2$
modular form and Dedekind expressed its multiplier system in terms of Dedekind
sums. Building on work of Goldstein, we extend these results from the modular

$S:\Gamma \to {\mathbb R}$ which we call a modular Dedekind symbol. We obtain
detailed properties of these symbols by means of the limit formula.
  Twisting the usual Eisenstein series with powers of additive homomorphisms
from $\Gamma$ to ${\mathbb C}$ produces higher-order Eisenstein series. These

shown that the pliable index coding problem is NP-hard and requires at most
$\mathcal{O}(\log^2(n))$ broadcast transmissions, which indicates exponential
savings over the conventional index coding that requires in the worst case
$\mathcal{O}(n)$ transmissions. In this work, building on a decoding criterion
that we propose, we first design a deterministic polynomial-time algorithm that

construct lower bound instances that require at least $\Omega(\log(n))$

the wavelength-integrated far-UV extinction derived from this decomposition

also shown that the color excess E(1300-1700), the extinction difference at

use in a variety of settings in the multi-agent systems literature. In some
cases, these algorithms can be random by design, as in a gossip-like algorithm,
and in other cases they are random due to external factors, as in the case of
intermittent communications. Targeting both of these scenarios, we present
novel convergence rate estimates for consensus problems solved over random
graphs. Established results provide asymptotic convergence in this setting, and
we provide estimates of the rate of convergence in two forms. First, we
estimate decreases in a quadratic Lyapunov function over time to bound how
quickly the agents' disagreement decays, and second we bound the probability of
being at least a given distance from the point of agreement. Both estimates
rely on (approximately) computing eigenvalues of the expected matrix
exponential of a random graph's Laplacian, which we do explicitly in terms of
the network's size and edge probability, without assuming that any relationship
between them holds. Simulation results are provided to support the theoretical
developments made.

laboratory studies of magnetic reconnection provide an important platform for

experimental measurements as well as numerical modeling of relativistic
magnetic reconnection driven by short-pulse, high-intensity lasers that produce
relativistic plasma along with extremely strong magnetic fields. Evidence of
magnetic reconnection was identified by the plasma's X-ray emission patterns,
changes to the electron energy spectrum, and by measuring the time over which
reconnection occurs. Accessing these relativistic conditions in the laboratory

magnitude higher than the PCE for a 45 wt\% blend. The optimal ratio is at
about 0.44:0.56 molar ratio of the active hole transporting to electron

higher PABC loading have efficiencies limited by 'hole' transport. Also
responsible for the lower efficiency at higher PABC concentrations was optical
filtering. The efficiency does not appear to be limited by deep charge

cycle. The variations in other activity proxies are found to be well correlated
with the variations in the acoustic frequencies. However, each proxy has a
slightly different time behaviour. Our goal is to characterize the differences
between the time behaviour of the frequency shifts and of two other activity
proxies, namely, the area covered by sunspots and the 10.7cm flux. We define a
new observable that is particularly sensitive to the short-term frequency
variations. We then compare the observable when computed from model frequency
shifts and from observed frequency shifts obtained with the Global Oscillation
Network Group (GONG) for cycle 23. Our analysis shows that on the shortest
time-scales the variations in the frequency shifts seen in the GONG
observations are strongly correlated with the variations in the area covered by
sunspots. However, a significant loss of correlation is still found. We verify
that the times when the frequency shifts and the sunspot area do not vary in a
similar way tend to coincide with the times of the maxima of the quasi-biennial
variations seen in the solar seismic data. A similar analysis of the relation
between the 10.7cm flux and the frequency shifts reveals that the short-time
variations in the frequency shifts follow even more closely those of the 10.7cm
flux than those of the sunspot area. However, a loss of correlation between
frequency shifts and 10.7cm flux variations is still found around the same
times.

accomplished by computing their zeta functions using a $p$-adic algorithm due

example, compute the zeta functions of the arising curves for $q=5$ and $l=4$
very efficiently, and we detail a proof-of-concept demonstration. Due to the
failure of Newton's identities in positive characteristic, the $l \ge p$ cases

  II","Noise-Robust Modes of the Retinal Population Code have the Geometry of
  ""Ridges"" and Correspond with Neuronal Communities",,,,,"q-bio.NC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  An appealing new principle for neural population codes is that correlations
among neurons organize neural activity patterns into a discrete set of
clusters, which can each be viewed as a noise-robust population ""codeword"".
Previous studies assumed that these codewords corresponded geometrically with
local peaks in the probability landscape of neural population responses. Here,
we analyze multiple datasets of the responses of ~150 retinal ganglion cells
and show that local probability peaks are absent under broad, non-repeated
stimulus ensembles, which are characteristic of natural behavior. However, we
find that neural activity still forms noise-robust clusters in this regime,
albeit clusters with a different geometry. We start by defining a soft local
maximum, which is a local probability maximum when constrained to a fixed spike
count. Next, we show that soft local maxima are robustly present, and can
moreover be linked across different spike count levels in the probability
landscape to form a ""ridge"". We found that these ridges are comprised of
combinations of spiking and silence in the neural population such that all of
the spiking neurons are members of the same neuronal community, a notion from
network theory. We argue that a neuronal community shares many of the
properties of Donald Hebb's classic cell assembly, and show that a simple,
biologically plausible decoding algorithm can recognize the presence of a
specific neuronal community.

unlock the technological potential of quantum photonics\cite{Kimble:Nat2008}.
Among the systems under investigation, semiconductor quantum dots are currently
emerging as near-optimal sources of indistinguishable single photons. However,
their performances as sources of entangled-photon pairs are in comparison still
modest. Experiments on conventional Stranski-Krastanow InGaAs quantum dots have
reported non-optimal levels of entanglement and indistinguishability of the
emitted photons. For applications such as entanglement teleportation and
quantum repeaters, both criteria have to be met simultaneously. In this work,
we show that this is possible focusing on a system that has received limited
attention so far: GaAs quantum dots grown via droplet etching. Using a
two-photon resonant excitation scheme, we demonstrate that these quantum dots
can emit triggered polarization-entangled photons with high purity
(g^(2)(0)=0.002 +/-0.002), high indistinguishability (0.93 +/-0.07) and high
entanglement fidelity (0.94 +/-0.01). Such unprecedented degree of
entanglement, which in contrast to InGaAs can theoretically reach near-unity
values, allows Bell's inequality (2.64 +/-0.01) to be violated without the aid
of temporal or spectral filtering. Our results show that if quantum-dot
entanglement resources are to be used for future quantum technologies, GaAs
might be the system of choice.

clusters into 15 subsets, spanning ranges in the richness parameter $5 \leq
\lambda \leq 180$ and redshift $0.2 \leq z \leq 0.8$, and fit the averaged mass
density contrast profiles with a model that accounts for seven distinct sources
of systematic uncertainty: shear measurement and photometric redshift errors;
cluster-member contamination; miscentering; deviations from the NFW halo
profile; halo triaxiality; and line-of-sight projections. We combine the
inferred cluster masses to estimate the joint scaling relation between mass,
richness and redshift, $\mathcal{M}(\lambda,z) \varpropto M_0 \lambda^{F}
(1+z)^{G}$. We find $M_0 \equiv \langle

relation is in excellent agreement with the weak-lensing calibration of
redMaPPer clusters in SDSS by Simet et al. (2016) and with the Saro et al.
(2015) calibration based on abundance matching of SPT-detected clusters. Our
results extend the redshift range over which the mass-richness relation of
redMaPPer clusters has been calibrated with weak lensing from $z\leq 0.3$ to
$z\leq0.8$. Calibration uncertainties of shear measurements and photometric
redshift estimates dominate our systematic error budget and require substantial
improvements for forthcoming studies.

Chinese and French astrophysicists have engaged the SVOM mission (Space-based
multi-band astronomical Variable Objects Monitor). Major advances in GRB
studies resulting from the synergy between space and ground observations, the
SVOM mission implements space and ground instrumentation. The scientific
objectives of the mission put a special emphasis on two categories of GRBs:
very distant GRBs at z$>$5 which constitute exceptional cosmological probes,
and faint/soft nearby GRBs which allow probing the nature of the progenitors
and the physics at work in the explosion. These goals have a major impact on
the design of the mission: the on-board hard X-ray imager is sensitive down to
4 keV and computes on line image and rate triggers, and the follow-up
telescopes on the ground are sensitive in the NIR. At the beginning of the next
decade, SVOM will be the main provider of GRB positions and spectral parameters
on very short time scale. The SVOM instruments will operate simultaneously with
a wide range of powerful astronomical devices. This rare instrumental
conjunction, combined with the relevance of the scientific topics connected
with GRB studies, warrants a remarkable scientific return for SVOM. In
addition, the SVOM instrumentation, primarily designed for GRB studies,
composes a unique multi-wavelength observatory with rapid slew capability that
will find multiple applications for the whole astronomy community beyond the
specific objectives linked to GRBs. This report lists the scientific themes
that will benefit from observations made with SVOM, whether they are specific
GRB topics, or more generally all the issues that can take advantage of the
multi-wavelength capabilities of SVOM.

avoid preventable medical errors such as delay in diagnosis, treatment or
untended deviations from best practice guidelines. However, because patient
condition changes rapidly and medical staffs are usually overloaded in acute
care setting, how to ensure the correctness of the system reaction to those
rapid changes and managing interaction with physicians remains challenging. In
this paper, we propose a domain-specific model-driven design approach to
address these challenges for designing clinical guidance systems. Firstly, we
translate the relevant medical knowledge described in generic literature and
different best practice guidelines into a set of executable and indirectly
verifiable finite state machine models. We introduce an organ-centric paradigm
to construct clinical models, and also develop a physician model to track
physician-system interactions and deviations. Secondly, for verification of the
compositional system model, we translate the model into timed automata, based
on which, we formalize a set of clinical and system safety requirements as
computation tree logic(CTL) formulas and use the UPPAAL model checking tool to
formally verify those requirements. In this way, the correctness of the model
can be mathematically proved. Finally, we can automatically generate the
executable code from the verified model using the corresponding code generation
tools for finite state machine. For evaluation, we apply the approach to the
design of clinical guidance systems for cardiac arrest. The generated code can
be deployed and interact with existing guidance systems.

Bell, Kochen and Specker, who discovered that for quantum systems of three or
more dimensions, measurements cannot be viewed as revealing pre-existing
properties of the system. More precisely, no model can assign deterministic
outcomes to the projectors of a quantum measurement in a way that depends only
on the projector and not the context (the full set of projectors) in which it
appeared, despite the fact that the Born rule probabilities associated with
projectors are independent of the context. A more general, operational
definition of contextuality introduced by Spekkens, which we will term
""probabilistic contextuality"", drops the assumption of determinism and allows
for operations other than measurements to be considered contextual.
Probabilistic noncontextuality represents the postulate that elements of an
operational theory that cannot be distinguished from each other based on the
statistics of arbitrarily many repeated experiments are ontologically
identical. In this paper, we introduce a framework that enables us to
distinguish between different noncontextuality assumptions in terms of the
relationships between the ontological representations of objects in the theory
given a certain relation between their operational representations. This
framework can be used to motivate and define a ""possibilistic"" analogue,
encapsulating the idea that elements of an operational theory that cannot be
unambiguously distinguished operationally can also not be unambiguously
distinguished ontologically. We then prove that possibilistic noncontextuality
is equivalent to an alternative notion proposed by Hardy. Finally, we
demonstrate that these weaker noncontextuality assumptions are sufficient to
prove alternative versions of known ""no-go"" theorems that constrain
$\psi$-epistemic models for quantum mechanics.

of relative and absolute topological order, which can be applied to many
different classes of unitary evolutions. These include fully many-body

compressed fiber sensing based on a probabilistic hierarchical sparse model. To
handle severe dictionary coherence, selective shrinkage is achieved using a
Weibull prior, which can be related to non-convex optimization with $p$-norm

structure to promote collective shrinkage based on a local similarity model.
This is incorporated in form of a kernel function in the joint prior density of

Approximate inference is accomplished using a hybrid technique that combines
Hamilton Monte Carlo and Gibbs sampling. To estimate the dictionary parameter,
we pursue two strategies, relying on either a deterministic or a probabilistic

estimated based on alternating estimation. In the second strategy, it is
jointly estimated along with the sparse coefficients. The performance is
evaluated in comparison to an existing method in various scenarios using

By leveraging crowd-sourcing platforms, such as Amazon Mechanical Turk, we

first show that by using recently introduced attention models, a naive

cherished images or videos by a fence that limits accessibility to the scene of
interest. The situation has been exacerbated by growing concerns of security at
public places and a need exists to provide a tool that can be used for
post-processing such fenced videos to produce a de-fenced image. There are
several challenges in this problem, we identify them as Robust detection of
fence/occlusions and Estimating pixel motion of background scenes and Filling
in the fence/occlusions by utilizing information in multiple frames of the
input video. In this work, we aim to build an automatic post-processing tool
that can efficiently rid the input video of occlusion artifacts like fences.
Our work is distinguished by two major contributions. The first is the
introduction of learning based technique to detect the fences patterns with
complicated backgrounds. The second is the formulation of objective function
and further minimization through loopy belief propagation to fill-in the fence
pixels. We observe that grids of Histogram of oriented gradients descriptor
using Support vector machines based classifier significantly outperforms
detection accuracy of texels in a lattice. We present results of experiments
using several real-world videos to demonstrate the effectiveness of the
proposed fence detection and de-fencing algorithm.

However, the physical properties of the likely asteroid which is discharging
disintegrating fragments remain largely unconstrained from the observations.
This process has not yet been modelled numerically. Here, we use the N-body
code PKDGRAV to compute dissipation properties for asteroids of different
spins, densities, masses, and eccentricities. We simulate both homogeneous and
differentiated asteroids, for up to two years, and find that the disruption
timescale is strongly dependent on density and eccentricity, but weakly
dependent on mass and spin. We find that primarily rocky differentiated bodies

can remain intact while occasionally shedding mass from their mantles. These
results suggest that the asteroid orbiting WD 1145+017 is differentiated,
resides just outside of the Roche radius for bulk density but just inside the
Roche radius for mantle density, and is more akin physically to an asteroid

introduced correlates with cluster age as observed. This broadening is

observations with the positional error of 0.2 mas. The afterglow position is
coincident with the disk of a galaxy ESO 580-49 at z= 0.01326 (~1"" from its
center), which makes GRB 111005A the second closest GRB known to date, after
GRB 980425. The radio afterglow of GRB 111005A was an order of magnitude less
luminous than those of local low-luminosity GRBs, and obviously than those of
cosmological GRBs. The radio flux was approximately constant and then
experienced an unusually rapid decay a month after the GRB explosion. Similarly
to only two other GRBs, we did not find the associated supernovae (SN), despite
deep near- and mid-infrared observations 1-9 days after the GRB explosion,
reaching ~20 times fainter than other SNe associated with GRBs. Moreover, we
measured twice solar metallicity for the GRB location. The low gamma-ray and
radio luminosities, rapid decay, lack of a SN, and super-solar metallicity
suggest that GRB 111005A represents a different rare class of GRBs than typical
core-collapse events. We modelled the spectral energy distribution of the GRB
111005A host finding that it is a dwarf, moderately star-forming galaxy,
similar to the host of GRB 980425. The existence of two local GRBs in such
galaxies is still consistent with the hypothesis that the GRB rate is
proportional to the cosmic star formation rate (SFR) density, but suggests that
the GRB rate is biased towards low SFRs. Using the far-infrared detection of
ESO 580-49, we conclude that the hosts of both GRBs 111005A and 980425 exhibit
lower dust content than what would be expected from their stellar masses and
optical colours.

several metrics: group dark matter halo mass M_h , central/satellite
designation, relative mass density of the cosmic web, and distance to nearest
massive group. We find that at fixed M_stars, satellites have decreasing G/S
with increasing M_h starting clearly at M_h = 10^12 Msun, suggesting the
presence of starvation and/or stripping mechanisms associated with halo gas
heating in intermediate-mass groups. The analogous relationship for centrals is
uncertain because halo abundance matching builds in relationships between
central G/S, stellar mass, and halo mass, which depend on the integrated group
property used as a proxy for halo mass (stellar or baryonic mass). On larger
scales G/S trends are less sensitive to the abundance matching method. At fixed
M_h < 10^12 Msun, the fraction of gas-poor centrals increases with large-scale
structure density. In overdense regions, we identify a rare population of
gas-poor centrals in low-mass (M_h < 10^11.4 Msun) halos primarily located
within 1.5 times the virial radius of more massive (M_h > 10^12 Msun) halos,
suggesting that gas stripping and/or starvation may be induced by interactions
with larger halos or the surrounding cosmic web. We find that the detailed
relationship between G/S and environment varies when we examine different
subvolumes of RESOLVE independently, which we suggest may be a signature of
assembly bias.

define safety for an individual decision in terms of invariance of the

impractical or expensive to be found through experiments. Our task is to
recover the missing reactions. By exploiting the problem structure, we model
reaction recovery as a hyperlink prediction problem, where each reaction is
regarded as a hyperlink connecting its participating vertices (metabolites).
Different from the traditional link prediction problem where two nodes form a
link, a hyperlink can involve an arbitrary number of nodes. Since the
cardinality of a hyperlink is variable, existing classifiers based on a fixed
number of input features become infeasible. Traditional methods, such as common
neighbors and Katz index, are not applicable either, since they are restricted
to pairwise similarities. In this paper, we propose a novel hyperlink
prediction algorithm, called Matrix Boosting (MATBoost). MATBoost conducts
inference jointly in the incidence space and adjacency space by performing an
iterative completion-matching optimization. We carry out extensive experiments
to show that MATBoost achieves state-of-the-art performance. For a metabolic

  RCT-to-target-population generalization of treatment effects","17 pages, 2 figures, 3 tables","Ann. Appl. Stat. 2017;11:225-47","10.1214/16-AOAS1001",,"stat.ME","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In the presence of treatment effect heterogeneity, the average treatment
effect (ATE) in a randomized controlled trial (RCT) may differ from the average
effect of the same treatment if applied to a target population of interest. If
all treatment effect moderators are observed in the RCT and in a dataset
representing the target population, we can obtain an estimate for the target
population ATE by adjusting for the difference in the distribution of the
moderators between the two samples. This paper considers sensitivity analyses
for two situations: (1) where we cannot adjust for a specific moderator $V$
observed in the RCT because we do not observe it in the target population; and
(2) where we are concerned that the treatment effect may be moderated by
factors not observed even in the RCT, which we represent as a composite
moderator $U$. In both situations, the outcome is not observed in the target
population. For situation (1), we offer three sensitivity analysis methods
based on (i) an outcome model, (ii) full weighting adjustment, and (iii)
partial weighting combined with an outcome model. For situation (2), we offer
two sensitivity analyses based on (iv) a bias formula and (v) partial weighting
combined with a bias formula. We apply methods (i) and (iii) to an example
where the interest is to generalize from a smoking cessation RCT conducted with
participants of alcohol/illicit drug use treatment programs to the target
population of people who seek treatment for alcohol/illicit drug use in the US
who are also cigarette smokers. In this case a treatment effect moderator is
observed in the RCT but not in the target population dataset.

  Processes",,,,,"stat.ML","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Gradient matching with Gaussian processes is a promising tool for learning
parameters of ordinary differential equations (ODE's). The essence of gradient
matching is to model the prior over state variables as a Gaussian process which
implies that the joint distribution given the ODE's and GP kernels is also
Gaussian distributed. The state-derivatives are integrated out analytically
since they are modelled as latent variables. However, the state variables
themselves are also latent variables because they are contaminated by noise.
Previous work sampled the state variables since integrating them out is
\textit{not} analytically tractable. In this paper we use mean-field
approximation to establish tight variational lower bounds that decouple state
variables and are therefore, in contrast to the integral over state variables,
analytically tractable and even concave for a restricted family of ODE's,
including nonlinear and periodic ODE's. Such variational lower bounds
facilitate ""hill climbing"" to determine the maximum a posteriori estimate of
ODE parameters. An additional advantage of our approach over sampling methods
is the determination of a proxy to the intractable posterior distribution over
state variables given observations and the ODE's.

SEDs to determine general properties of the photosphere and disk presence. We
also used low resolution optical and near-infrared spectroscopy to study
activity, accretion, gravity and effective temperature sensitive indicators. We
propose a VO-based spectral index that is both temperature and age sensitive.
We derived physical parameters using independent techniques confirming the
already common feature/problem of the age/luminosity spread. In particular, we
highlight two brown dwarfs showing very similar temperatures but clearly
different surface gravity (explained invoking extreme early accretion). We also
show how, despite large improvement in the dust treatment in theoretical

fragmentation functions, describing the fragmentation of a quark into a hadron,
have a strong dependence on the energy fraction $z$ of the observed hadron.
Hadrons with large $z$ contain more information about the struck quark. This
can be used in a weighting procedure to improve the figure of merit (= inverse

  Mathematically the problem can be described as finding an optimal solution in
terms of the figure of merit for parameters $\boldsymbol \Theta$ determined
from a system of linear equations ${\bf B}(x) {\boldsymbol \Theta} ={\bf
Y}(x)$, where the measured input vector ${\bf Y}(x)$ is given as event

transition temperature and unusually low for their class of materials steepness

ascribed to the change of the energy barrier for relaxation due to a decrease
in the zero-point energy upon D-H substitution. The observed difference in the
behavior of confined and bulk water demonstrates high sensitivity of quantum

demonstrate that extrapolation of confined water properties to the bulk water

magnetic field. In the presence of the magnetic field the hydrodynamically
stable flow can demonstrate non - axisymmetric azimuthal magnetorotational
instability (AMRI) both in the diffusionless case and in the double-diffusive
case with viscous and ohmic dissipation. Performing stability analysis of
amplitude transport equations of short-wavelength approximation, we find that
the threshold of the diffusionless AMRI via the Hamilton-Hopf bifurcation is a
singular limit of the thresholds of the viscous and resistive AMRI
corresponding to the dissipative Hopf bifurcation and manifests itself as the
Whitney umbrella singular point. A smooth transition between the two types of
instabilities is possible only if the magnetic Prandtl number is equal to
unity, $\rm Pm=1$. At a fixed $\rm Pm\ne 1$ the threshold of the
double-diffusive AMRI is displaced by finite distance in the parameter space
with respect to the diffusionless case even in the zero dissipation limit. The
complete neutral stability surface contains three Whitney umbrella singular
points and two mutually orthogonal intervals of self-intersection. At these
singularities the double-diffusive system reduces to a marginally stable system
which is either Hamiltonian or parity-time (PT) symmetric.

second order (in both time and space) numerical schemes for nonlocal Allen-Cahn

solvability and energy stability ensures $\ell^4$ stability. The convergence
analysis for the nAC equation follows the standard procedure of consistency and
stability estimate for the numerical error function. For the nCH equation, due
to the complicated form of the nonlinear term, a careful expansion of its
discrete gradient is undertaken and an $H^{-1}$ inner product estimate of this
nonlinear numerical error is derived to establish convergence. In addition, an
a-priori $W^{1,\infty}$ bound of the numerical solution at the discrete level
is needed in the error estimate. Such a bound can be obtained by performing a
higher order consistency analysis by using asymptotic expansions for the
numerical solution. Following the technique originally proposed by Strang
(e.g., 1964), instead of the standard comparison between the exact and
numerical solutions, an error estimate between the numerical solution and the
constructed approximate solution yields an $O( s^3 + h^4)$ convergence in
$\ell^\infty (0, T; \ell^2)$ norm, which leads to the necessary bound under a
standard constraint $s \le C h$. Here, we also prove convergence of the scheme

sheer number and size of the data sets, coupled with the diverse spatial and

  Refinement Tool for Incompressible Flows",,,,,"physics.comp-ph math.NA physics.flu-dyn","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Coarse grid projection (CGP) methodology is a novel multigrid method for
systems involving decoupled nonlinear evolution equations and linear elliptic
Poisson equations. The nonlinear equations are solved on a fine grid and the
linear equations are solved on a corresponding coarsened grid. Mapping
operators execute data transfer between the grids. The CGP framework is
constructed upon spatial and temporal discretization schemes. This framework
has been established for finite volume/difference discretizations as well as
explicit time integration methods. In this article we present for the first
time a version of CGP for finite element discretizations, which uses a
semi-implicit time integration scheme. The mapping functions correspond to the
finite-element shape functions. With the novel data structure introduced, the
mapping computational cost becomes insignificant. We apply CGP to
pressure-correction schemes used for the incompressible Navier-Stokes flow
computations. This version is validated on standard test cases with realistic
boundary conditions using unstructured triangular meshes. We also pioneer
investigations of the effects of CGP on the accuracy of the pressure field. It
is found that although CGP reduces the pressure field accuracy, it preserves
the accuracy of the pressure gradient and thus the velocity field, while
achieving speedup factors ranging from approximately 2 to 30. Exploring the
influence of boundary conditions on CGP, the minimum speedup occurs for
velocity Dirichlet boundary conditions, while the maximum speedup occurs for
open boundary conditions. We discuss the CGP method as a guide for partial mesh
refinement of incompressible flow computations and show its application for
simulations of flow over a backward-facing step and flow past a cylinder.

account the impact of wide field effects such as the $w$-term which are then
used as appropriate weights in cross-correlating the measured visibilities. Our
method is applicable to any radio interferometer that tracks a phase center and
could be utilized for arrays such as MWA, LOFAR, GMRT, PAPER and HERA. In the
literature the delay spectrum approach has been implemented for near-redundant
baselines using drift scan observations. In this paper we explore the scheme
for non-redundant tracking arrays, and this is the first application of delay
spectrum methodology to such data to extract the HI signal. We analyze 3 hours

directly compare the preferences of the two groups, which is desirable for
political science but difficult with traditional survey methods. After
validating the aggregated-level inferences of this model against results of
related work and on simple prediction tasks, we apply the model to better
understand the phenomenon of political polarization in the Texas, New York, and

that the electorates in these states may be less bimodal than the distribution

towards the chiral limit similarly to $N_f=4$ QCD, in sharp contrast to
$N_f=12$ QCD where the ratios become flattened. The hyperscaling relation holds
with roughly a universal value of the anomalous dimension, $\gamma_m \simeq 1$,
with a notable exception of $M_\pi$ with $\gamma_m \simeq 0.6$ as in the
previous results. This is a salient feature (""walking signal"") of $N_f=8$,
unlike either $N_f=4$ which has no hyperscaling relation at all, or $N_f=12$
QCD which exhibits universal hyperscaling. We further confirm the previous
observation of the light $\sigma$ with mass comparable to the pion in the
studied $m_f$ region. In a chiral limit extrapolation of the $\sigma$ mass
using the dilaton chiral perturbation theory and also using the simple linear
fit, we find the value consistent with the 125 GeV Higgs boson within errors.
Our results suggest that the theory could be a good candidate for walking
technicolor model, having anomalous dimension $\gamma_m \simeq 1$ and a light
flavor-singlet scalar meson as a technidilaton, which can be identified with
the 125 GeV composite Higgs in $N_f=8$ one-family model.

The collision and force terms in the DBE account for the molecular collision

addition to recovering the modified Navier-Stokes equations in the hydrodynamic

Furthermore, we use the DBM to investigate the dynamic process of the RTI. The
invariants of tensors for nonequilibrium effects are presented and studied. For
low Reynolds numbers, both global nonequilibrium manifestations and the growth
rate of the entropy of mixing show three stages (i.e., the reducing,

high Reynolds numbers. Relevant physical mechanisms are analyzed and discussed.

nonreciprocity in spin waves from Ta/Py bilayer systems with out-of-plane

integration into programming languages. Untyped access is error-prone while
mapping approaches cannot fully capture the conceptualization of semantic data.
In this paper, we present $\lambda_{DL}$,a $\lambda$-calculus with a modified
type system to provide type-safe integration of semantic data. This is achieved
by the integration of description logics into the $\lambda$-calculus for typing
and data access. It is centered around several key design principles. Among
these are (1) the usage of semantic conceptualizations as types, (2) subtype
inference for these types, and (3) type-checked query access to the data by
both ensuring the satisfiability of queries as well as typing query results
precisely in $\lambda_{DL}$. The paper motivates the use of a modified type
system for semantic data and it provides the theoretic foundation for the
integration of description logics as well as the core formal specifications of
$\lambda_{DL}$ including a proof of type safety.

Tomlinson-Harashima precoding (SO-THP) with generalized matrix inversion (GMI)
technique to maximize the physical-layer secrecy rate. For the purpose of
comparison, we examine different traditional precoders with the proposed
algorithm in terms of secrecy rate as well as BER performance. We also
investigate simplified generalized matrix inversion (S-GMI) and
lattice-reduction (LR) techniques in order to efficiently compute the
parameters of the precoders. We further conduct computational complexity and
secrecy rate analysis of the proposed and existing algorithms. In addition, in
the scenario without knowledge of channel state information (CSI) to the
eavesdroppers, a strategy of injecting artificial noise (AN) prior to the
transmission is employed to enhance the physical-layer secrecy rate. Simulation
results show that the proposed non-linear precoders outperform existing
precoders in terms of BER and secrecy rate performance.

compact embedded hypersurface in $\mathbb{R}^N$ with constant mean curvature
must be a sphere. For its proof, A.D. Alexandrov invented his reflection
priciple. In $1982$, R. Reilly gave an alternative proof, based on integral
identities and inequalities, connected with the torsional rigidity of a bar. In
this article we study the stability of the spherical symmetry: the question is
how much a hypersurface is near to a sphere, when its mean curvature is near to
a constant in some norm. We present a stability estimate that states that a
compact hypersurface $\Gamma\subset\mathbb{R}^N$ can be contained in a
spherical annulus whose interior and exterior radii, say $\rho_i$ and $\rho_e$,
satisfy the inequality $$ \rho_e - \rho_i \le C \Vert H - H_0
\Vert^{\tau_N}_{L^1 (\Gamma)}, $$ where $\tau_N=1/2$ if $N=2, 3$, and
$\tau_N=1/(N+2)$ if $N\ge 4$. Here, $H$ is the mean curvature of $\Gamma$,
$H_0$ is some reference constant and $C$ is a constant that depends on some
geometrical and spectral parameters associated with $\Gamma$. This estimate
improves previous results in the literature under various aspects. We also
present similar estimates for some related overdetermined problems.

of the second R\'enyi entropy of one interval of length L in minimal E8 Toda
field theory. It has been known for some time that the entanglement entropy of
a massive quantum field theory in 1+1 dimensions saturates to a constant value
for m1 L <<1 where m1 is the mass of the lightest particle in the spectrum.
Subsequently, results by Cardy, Castro-Alvaredo and Doyon have shown that there
are exponentially decaying corrections to this behaviour which are
characterised by Bessel functions with arguments proportional to m1 L. For the
von Neumann entropy the leading correction to saturation takes the precise
universal form -K0(2m1 L)/8 whereas for the R\'enyi entropies leading
corrections which are proportional to K0(m1 L) are expected. Recent numerical
work by P\'almai for the second R\'enyi entropy of minimal E8 Toda has found
next-to-leading order corrections decaying as exp(-2m1 L) rather than the
expected exp(-m1 L). In this paper we investigate the origin of this result and
show that it is incorrect. An exact form factor computation of correlators of
branch point twist fields reveals that the leading corrections are proportional
to K0(m1 L) as expected.

robustness properties of the symbolic heap fragment of separation logic with
user-defined inductive predicates. Robustness properties, such as
satisfiability, reachability, and acyclicity, are important for a wide range of
reasoning tasks in automated program analysis and verification based on
separation logic. Previously, such properties have appeared in many places in
the separation logic literature, but have not been studied in a systematic
manner. In this paper, we develop an algorithmic framework based on heap
automata that allows us to derive asymptotically optimal decision procedures
for a wide range of robustness properties in a uniform way. We implemented a
protoype of our framework and obtained promising results for all of the
aforementioned robustness properties. Further, we demonstrate the applicability
of heap automata beyond robustness properties. We apply our algorithmic
framework to the model checking and the entailment problem for symbolic-heap
separation logic.

  Pollutants with Urban Big Data",,,,,"cs.AI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Many countries are suffering from severe air pollution. Understanding how
different air pollutants accumulate and propagate is critical to making
relevant public policies. In this paper, we use urban big data (air quality
data and meteorological data) to identify the \emph{spatiotemporal (ST) causal
pathways} for air pollutants. This problem is challenging because: (1) there
are numerous noisy and low-pollution periods in the raw air quality data, which
may lead to unreliable causality analysis, (2) for large-scale data in the ST
space, the computational complexity of constructing a causal structure is very
high, and (3) the \emph{ST causal pathways} are complex due to the interactions
of multiple pollutants and the influence of environmental factors. Therefore,
we present \emph{p-Causality}, a novel pattern-aided causality analysis
approach that combines the strengths of \emph{pattern mining} and
\emph{Bayesian learning} to efficiently and faithfully identify the \emph{ST
causal pathways}. First, \emph{Pattern mining} helps suppress the noise by
capturing frequent evolving patterns (FEPs) of each monitoring sensor, and
greatly reduce the complexity by selecting the pattern-matched sensors as
""causers"". Then, \emph{Bayesian learning} carefully encodes the local and ST
causal relations with a Gaussian Bayesian network (GBN)-based graphical model,
which also integrates environmental influences to minimize biases in the final
results. We evaluate our approach with three real-world data sets containing
982 air quality sensors, in three regions of China from 01-Jun-2013 to
19-Dec-2015. Results show that our approach outperforms the traditional causal
structure learning methods in time efficiency, inference accuracy and
interpretability.

that are distinctly separated over the Bloch sphere. Additionally, the nuclei
with angular momenta greater than 1/2 possess a quadrupolar charge
distribution. At the intersection of these two phenomena, we devise a simple
scheme for generating various types of nuclear spin cat states. The native
biaxial electric quadrupole interaction that is readily available in strained
solid-state systems plays a key role here. However, the fact that built-in
strain cannot be switched off poses a challenge for the stabilization of target
cat states once they are prepared. We remedy this by abruptly diverting via a
single rotation pulse the state evolution to the neighborhood of the fixed
points of the underlying classical Hamiltonian flow. Optimal process parameters
are obtained as a function of electric field gradient biaxiality and nuclear
spin angular momentum. The overall procedure is seen to be robust under 5%
deviations from optimal values. We show that higher level cat states with four
superposed CSS can also be formed using three rotation pulses. Finally, for
open systems subject to decoherence we extract the scaling of cat state
fidelity damping with respect to the spin quantum number. This reveals rates
greater than the dephasing of individual CSSs. Yet, our results affirm that
these cat states can preserve their fidelities for practically useful durations
under the currently attainable decoherence levels.

in spiral galaxies which has yet to be explained. The lack of an explanation
confounds our attempts to verify the Cosmological Principle, and has spurred
some debate as to whether a bias exists in the real universe. The bias
manifests not only in the obvious case of trying to decide if the universe as a
whole has a winding bias, but also in the more insidious case of selecting
which galaxies to include in a winding direction survey. While the former bias
has been accounted for in a previous image-mirroring study, the latter has not.
Furthermore, the bias has never been {\em corrected} in the GZ1 catalog, as
only a small sample of the GZ1 catalog was re-examined during the mirror study.
We show that the existing bias is a human {\em selection} effect rather than a
human chirality bias. In effect, the excess S-wise votes are spuriously
""stolen"" from the elliptical and edge-on-disk categories, not the Z-wise
category. Thus, when selecting a set of spiral galaxies by imposing a threshold
$T$ so that $\max(P_S,P_Z) > T$ or $P_S+P_Z>T$, we spuriously select more
S-wise than Z-wise galaxies. We show that when a provably unbiased machine
selects which galaxies are spirals independent of their chirality, the S-wise
surplus vanishes, even if humans are still used to determine the chirality.
Thus, when viewed across the entire GZ1 sample (and by implication, the Sloan
catalog), the winding direction of arms in spiral galaxies as viewed from Earth
is consistent with the flip of a fair coin.

inner detrimental shell of anodic TiO2 nanotubes (NTs). This then allows
controlled well-defined layer-by-layer decoration of these TiO2-NT walls with
TiO2 nanoparticles (this in contrast to conventional TiO2 nanotubes). We show
that such defined multiple layered decoration can be optimized to build dye
sensitized solar cells that (under back-side illumination conditions) can yield
solar light conversion efficiencies in the range of 8 %. The beneficial effects
observed can be ascribed to a combination of three factors : 1) improved
electronic properties of the single walled tubes themselves, 2) a further
improvement of the electronic properties by the defined TiCl4 treatment, and 3)

presented, called DSValidator, with the goal of reproducing counterexamples
that refute specific properties related to digital systems. We exploit
counterexamples generated by the Digital System Verifier (DSVerifier), which is
a model checking tool based on satisfiability modulo theories for digital
systems. DSValidator reproduces the execution of a digital system, relating its
input with the counterexample, in order to establish trust in a verification
result. We show that DSValidator can validate a set of intricate
counterexamples for digital controllers used in a real quadrotor attitude
system within seconds and also expose incorrect verification results in
DSVerifier. The resulting toolbox leverages the potential of combining
different verification tools for validating digital systems via an exchangeable
counterexample format.

studied. This result is known to hold when the interval is replaced by a metric
(quantum) tree graph. We prove that the solutions of the real stationary
nonlinear Schr\""odinger equation on an interval satisfy a nonlinear version of
the Sturm oscillation property. However, we show that unlike the linear theory,
the nonlinear version of the Sturm oscillation breaks down already for a star
graph. We point out conditions under which this violation can be assured.

constraints from both nuclear physics measurements and astronomical

such as beta-decay rates; nuclear masses; neutron-capture cross sections;
beta-delayed neutron emission; probability of spontaneous fission, beta- and
neutron-induced fission, fission fragment mass distributions; neutrino-induced
reaction cross sections, etc. We highlight the effects on models for
$r$-process nucleosynthesis of newly measured $\beta$-decay half-lives, masses,
and spectroscopy of neutron-rich nuclei near the $r$-process path. We overview
r-process nucleosynthesis in the neutrino driven wind above the proto-neutron
star in core collapse supernovae along with the possibility of
magneto-hydrodynamic jets from rotating supernova explosion models. We also
consider the possibility of neutron star mergers as an r-process environment. A
key outcome of newly measured nuclear properties far from stability is the
degree of shell quenching for neutron rich isotopes near the closed neutron
shells. This leads to important constraints on the sites for $r$-process
nucleosynthesis in which freezeout occurs on a rapid timescale.

uncertainty principle (GUP) can be constrained by the gravitational wave event
GW150914, which was discovered by the LIGO Scientific and Virgo Collaborations.
Firstly, according to the Heisenberg uncertainty principle (HUP) and the data
of gravitational wave event GW150914, we derive the standard energy-momentum
dispersion relation and calculate the difference between the propagation speed
of gravitons and the speed of light, i.e., $\Delta \upsilon$. Next, using two
proposals regarding the GUP, we also generalize our study to the quantum
gravity case and obtain the modified speed of gravitons. Finally, based on the
modified speed of gravitons and $\Delta \upsilon$, the improved upper bounds on
the GUP parameters are obtained. The results show that the upper limits of the
GUP parameters $\beta_0$ and $\alpha_0$ are $2.3 \times 10^ {60}$ and $1.8
\times 10^{20}$.

  Magnetic Fluid","14 pages, 5 figures, 23 references",,,,"cond-mat.soft","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Using two different configurations of temperature and magnetic field
gradients, we observed that, in a quasi one-dimensional magnetic fluid,
magnetic force either reduces the temperature difference across the sample when
the two gradients are parallel to each other (PL), or increase the temperature
difference when the two gradients are antiparallel (AP), where the single
convection roll in zero field was replaced by two localized flows at the two
ends of the sample cell. This flow structure stops the heat flow of approaching
to thermal equilibrium in the system, causing the temperature at hot side of
the sample cell getting hotter and cold side becoming colder. None of these
phenomena can be described by the existing theories of magnetically-induced
instabilities. The underlying physics for observed results for AP configuration
has been proposed as the mechanism to drive a new type of heat engines that has
much higher efficiency than Carnot engines and has no pollution to the
environment, our results point to the potential feasibility of this proposed
mechanism.

is studied by analyzing the evolution of local and nonlocal observables in the
holographic approach. The system is driven in an initial anisotropic and
far-from equilibrium state through an impulsive time-dependent deformation
(quench) of the boundary spacetime geometry. Effective temperature and entropy
density are related to the position and area of a black hole horizon, which has
formed as a consequence of the distortion. The behavior of stress-energy
tensor, equal-time correlation functions and Wilson loops of different shapes
is examined, and a hierarchy among their thermalization times emerges: probes
involving shorter length scales thermalize faster.
