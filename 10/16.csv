  104-109",,,"stat.ML","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In this paper, we consider clustering data that is assumed to come from one
of finitely many pointed convex polyhedral cones. This model is referred to as
the Union of Polyhedral Cones (UOPC) model. Similar to the Union of Subspaces
(UOS) model where each data from each subspace is generated from a (unknown)
basis, in the UOPC model each data from each cone is assumed to be generated
from a finite number of (unknown) \emph{extreme rays}.To cluster data under
this model, we consider several algorithms - (a) Sparse Subspace Clustering by
Non-negative constraints Lasso (NCL), (b) Least squares approximation (LSA),
and (c) K-nearest neighbor (KNN) algorithm to arrive at affinity between data
points. Spectral Clustering (SC) is then applied on the resulting affinity
matrix to cluster data into different polyhedral cones. We show that on an
average KNN outperforms both NCL and LSA and for this algorithm we provide the
deterministic conditions for correct clustering. For an affinity measure
between the cones it is shown that as long as the cones are not very coherent
and as long as the density of data within each cone exceeds a threshold, KNN
leads to accurate clustering. Finally, simulation results on real datasets
(MNIST and YaleFace datasets) depict that the proposed algorithm works well on
real data indicating the utility of the UOPC model and the proposed algorithm.

possibly expensive analytics processes is subject to decay over time, as the
data used to compute it drifts, the algorithms used in the processes are
improved, and the external knowledge embodied by reference datasets used in the
computation evolves. Deciding when such knowledge outcomes should be refreshed,
following a sequence of data change events, requires problem-specific functions
to quantify their value and its decay over time, as well as models for
estimating the cost of their re-computation. What makes this problem
challenging is the ambition to develop a decision support system for informing
data analytics re-computation decisions over time, that is both generic and
customisable. With the help of a case study from genomics, in this vision paper
we offer an initial formalisation of this problem, highlight research
challenges, and outline a possible approach based on the collection and
analysis of metadata from a history of past computations.

However, the galaxy-BH interplay is challenging to study due to the large
dynamical range and complex physics involved. As a consequence, hydrodynamical
cosmological simulations normally adopt sub-grid models to track the unresolved
physical processes, in particular BH accretion; usually the spatial scale where
the BH dominates the hydrodynamical processes (the Bondi radius) is unresolved,
and an approximate Bondi-Hoyle accretion rate is used to estimate the growth of
the BH. By comparing hydrodynamical simulations at different resolutions (300,
30, 3 pc) using a Bondi-Hoyle approximation to sub-parsec runs with
non-parameterized accretion, our aim is to probe how well an approximated Bondi
accretion is able to capture the BH accretion physics and the subsequent
feedback on the galaxy. We analyse an isolated galaxy simulation that includes
cooling, star formation, Type Ia and Type II supernovae, BH accretion and AGN
feedback (radiation pressure, Compton heating/cooling) where mass, momentum,
and energy are deposited in the interstellar medium through conical winds. We
find that on average the approximated Bondi formalism can lead to both over-
and under-estimations of the BH growth, depending on resolution and on how the
variables entering into the Bondi-Hoyle formalism are calculated.

elliptic paraboloids of different radii. Using asymptotic techniques, a
solution to the deformation problem of such material has been recently obtained
extending previous ones referred to homogeneous materials. The layer itself is
thin in comparison with the size of the contact area and the observed time is
shorter than the hydrogel characteristic time. The emerging three-dimensional
contact problem is solved in closed-form and numerical benchmarks for constant
and oscillating loads are given. The results are shown in terms of contact
pressure and approach of the bones. The latter is derived to be directly
proportional to the contact area. Existing experimental data are reinterpreted
in view of the current model formulation. Comparisons are made with existing
solutions for homogeneous biphasic materials in order to underline the
functional importance of inhomogeneity in spreading the contact pressure
distribution across the contact area. Particular attention is paid to the
applicability of the retrieved formulas for interpreting measurements of in

interval from its values at $M+1$ distinct points. When the points are
equispaced, a recent result (the so-called impossibility theorem) has shown
that the best possible convergence rate of a stable method is root-exponential
in $M$, and that any method with faster exponential convergence must also be
exponentially ill-conditioned at a certain rate. This result hinges on a
classical theorem of Coppersmith & Rivlin concerning the maximal behaviour of
polynomials bounded on an equispaced grid. In this paper, we first generalize
this theorem to arbitrary point distributions. We then present an extension of
the impossibility theorem valid for general nonequispaced points, and apply it
to the case of points that are equidistributed with respect to (modified)
Jacobi weight functions. This leads to a necessary sampling rate for stable
approximation from such points. We prove that this rate is also sufficient, and
therefore exactly quantify (up to constants) the precise sampling rate for
approximating analytic functions from such node distributions with stable
methods. Numerical results -- based on computing the maximal polynomial via a
variant of the classical Remez algorithm -- confirm our main theorems. Finally,
we discuss the implications of our results for polynomial least-squares
approximations. In particular, we theoretically confirm the well-known
heuristic that stable least-squares approximation using polynomials of degree
$N < M$ is possible only once $M$ is sufficiently large for there to be a
subset of $N$ of the nodes that mimic the behaviour of the $N$th set of
Chebyshev nodes.

universe is in a stationary state, where two non-interacting subsystems, the
clock and the rest, are entangled. As a consequence, by choosing a suitable
observable of the clock, the relative state of the rest of the universe evolves
unitarily with respect to the variable labelling the clock observable's
eigenstates, which is then interpreted as time. This model for an evolution
without evolution (Page and Wootters, 1983), albeit elegant, has never been

offers a pragmatic solution to this problem. However, at test time most
attribute-based methods require a full description of attribute associations
for each unseen class. Providing these associations is time consuming and often
requires domain specific knowledge. In this work, we aim to carry out
attribute-based zero-shot classification in an unsupervised manner. We propose
an approach to learn relations that couples class embeddings with their
corresponding attributes. Given only the name of an unseen class, the learned
relationship model is used to automatically predict the class-attribute
associations. Furthermore, our model facilitates transferring attributes across
data sets without additional effort. Integrating knowledge from multiple
sources results in a significant additional improvement in performance. We
evaluate on two public data sets: Animals with Attributes and aPascal/aYahoo.
Our approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both predicting

tuning the oxygen content, a systematic study of the Hall signal and
magnetoresistivity up to 58 Tesla on LCCO thin films identifies two
characteristic temperatures. The former is quite robust, whereas the latter
becomes flexible with increasing magnetic field, thereby linking respectively

database system is typically required to disambiguate parts of the
user-specified query against the database, using whatever resources are
intrinsically available to it (the database schema, data values distributions,
natural language models etc). Often, systems will also have a user-interaction
log available, which can serve as an extrinsic resource to supplement their
model based on their own intrinsic resources. This leads to a problem of how
best to combine the system's prior ranking with insight derived from the
user-interaction log. Statistical inference techniques such as maximum
likelihood or Bayesian updates from a subjective prior turn out not to apply in
a straightforward way due to possible noise from user search behavior and to
encoding biases endemic to the system's models. In this paper, we address such

the form of caching or memoization. In managed languages like Java or
JavaScript, however, this space-time tradeoff is complex. Using more space
translates into higher garbage collection costs, especially at the limit of
available memory. Existing runtime systems provide limited support for
space-sensitive algorithms, forcing programmers into difficult and often
brittle choices about provisioning.
  This paper presents prioritized garbage collection, a cooperative programming
language and runtime solution to this problem. Prioritized GC provides an
interface similar to soft references, called priority references, which
identify objects that the collector can reclaim eagerly if necessary. The key
difference is an API for defining the policy that governs when priority
references are cleared and in what order. Application code specifies a priority
value for each reference and a target memory bound. The collector reclaims
references, lowest priority first, until the total memory footprint of the
cache fits within the bound. We use this API to implement a space-aware
least-recently-used (LRU) cache, called a Sache, that is a drop-in replacement
for existing caches, such as Google's Guava library. The garbage collector
automatically grows and shrinks the Sache in response to available memory and
workload with minimal provisioning information from the programmer. Using a
Sache, it is almost impossible for an application to experience a memory leak,
memory pressure, or an out-of-memory crash caused by software caching.

separately (i.e., sequentially), but recent research has shown that optimizing
the two tasks jointly can substantially improve the performance of both. The
premise behind the latter genre is that the data samples are obtained via
linear transformation of latent representations that are easy to cluster; but
in practice, the transformation from the latent space to the data can be more
complicated. In this work, we assume that this transformation is an unknown and
possibly nonlinear function. To recover the `clustering-friendly' latent
representations and to better cluster the data, we propose a joint DR and
K-means clustering approach in which DR is accomplished via learning a deep
neural network (DNN). The motivation is to keep the advantages of jointly
optimizing the two tasks, while exploiting the deep neural network's ability to
approximate any nonlinear function. This way, the proposed approach can work
well for a broad class of generative models. Towards this end, we carefully
design the DNN structure and the associated joint optimization criterion, and
propose an effective and scalable algorithm to handle the formulated
optimization problem. Experiments using different real datasets are employed to
showcase the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

expensive and simulation does not usually transfer well to hardware. To counter
this, we need al- gorithms that are sample efficient and inherently safe.
Bayesian Optimization is a powerful sample-efficient tool for optimizing
non-convex black-box functions. However, its performance can degrade in higher
dimensions. We develop a distance metric for bipedal locomotion that enhances
the sample-efficiency of Bayesian Optimization and use it to train a 16
dimensional neuromuscular model for planar walking. This distance metric
reflects some basic gait features of healthy walking and helps us quickly
eliminate a majority of unstable controllers. With our approach we can learn
policies for walking in less than 100 trials for a range of challenging
settings. In simulation, we show results on two different costs and on various
terrains including rough ground and ramps, sloping upwards and downwards. We
also perturb our models with unknown inertial disturbances analogous with
differences between simulation and hardware. These results are promising, as
they indicate that this method can potentially be used to learn control
policies on hardware.

sublattice with fractal dimension $d_a<d$ and are characterized by the
absorption rate $w_a$ which may be finite (imperfect traps) or infinite
(perfect traps). Initial coordinates are chosen randomly at or within a fixed
distance of a trap. For weakly absorbing traps ($w_a\ll w$), we find that
$f(t)$ can be closely approximated by a stretched exponential function over the
initial stage of relaxation, with stretching exponent $\alpha=1-(d-d_a)/d_w$,
where $d_w$ is the random walk dimension of the host lattice. At the end of
this initial stage there occurs a crossover to power law kinetics $f(t)\sim
t^{-\alpha}$ with the same exponent $\alpha$ as for the stretched exponential

subsequent 1013 days using the complete configuration of eight detectors (Oct.
2012--Jul. 2015). The $\overline{\nu}_{e}$ rate observed at the far detectors

correlations for achieving high accuracy. Spatial Auto-Regression (SAR) is a
common tool used to model such data, where the spatial contiguity matrix (W)
encodes the spatial correlations. However, the efficacy of SAR is limited by
two factors. First, it depends on the choice of contiguity matrix, which is
typically not learnt from data, but instead, is assumed to be known apriori.
Second, it assumes that the observations can be explained by linear models. In
this paper, we propose a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) framework to model
geo-spatial data (specifi- cally housing prices), to learn the spatial
correlations automatically. We show that neighborhood information embedded in
satellite imagery can be leveraged to achieve the desired spatial smoothing. An
additional upside of our framework is the relaxation of linear assumption on
the data. Specific challenges we tackle while implementing our framework
include, (i) how much of the neighborhood is relevant while estimating housing
prices? (ii) what is the right approach to capture multiple resolutions of
satellite imagery? and (iii) what other data-sources can help improve the
estimation of spatial correlations? We demonstrate a marked improvement of 57%

this case suggests that the average transition probability is the result of
averaging of the conventional Landau-Zener probability, calculated for a given

by sparse realizations of noise for which J(t) passes through zero within a
narrow time interval near the level crossing. Two models of noise, random

Gaussian noise and the noise is assumed to have common variance. In this paper,
we prove these bounds under the Binomial observation model which meets the
actual model in QST.
  Second, we study the Dantzig estimator (DE) for estimating the unknown low
rank density matrix under the Binomial observation model by using Pauli
measurements. In our previous papers, we studied the least squares estimator
and the projection estimator, where we proved the optimal convergence rates for
the least squares estimator in Schatten $p$-norms with $1\leq p\leq 2$ and,
under a stronger condition, the optimal convergence rates for the projection
estimator in Schatten $p$-norms with $1\leq p\leq +\infty$. In this paper, we
show that the results of these two distinct estimators can be simultaneously
obtained by the Dantzig estimator. Moreover, better convergence rates in
Schatten norm distances can be proved for Dantzig estimator under conditions
weaker than those needed in previous papers. When the objective function of DE
is replaced by the negative von Neumann entropy, we obtain sharp convergence
rate in Kullback-Leibler divergence.

mass-loss scheme. The magnitude and evolution of mass-loss rates significantly
affect the main sequence evolution, and the properties of post-main sequence
objects, including their rotational velocities. Driven by potential
discrepancies between theoretically predicted and observationally derived
mass-loss rates in the OB star range, we particularly aim to investigate the
response to mass-loss rates that are lower than currently adopted, in parallel
with the mass-loss behavior at the ""first"" bi-stability jump. We perform 1D
hydrodynamical model calculations of single $20 - 60 \, M_{\odot}$ Galactic ($Z
= 0.014$) stars where the effects of stellar winds are already significant
during the main sequence phase. We develop an experimental wind routine to
examine the behavior and response of the models under the influence of
different mass-loss rates. This observationally guided, simple and flexible
wind routine is not a new mass-loss description but a useful tool based on the
Wind-momentum Luminosity Relation and other scaling relations, and provides a
meaningful base for various tests and comparisons. The main result of this
study indicates a dichotomy when accounting for currently debated problems
regarding mass-loss rates of hot massive stars. In a fully diffusive approach,
and for commonly adopted initial rotational velocities, lower mass-loss rates
than theoretically predicted require to invoke an additional source of angular
momentum loss (either due to bi-stability braking, or yet unidentified) to
brake down surface rotational velocities. [...]

During testing, the terms present in the test document are extracted and the

achieve quick search of term weights, Btree indexing data structure has been
adapted. Finally, the class which receives maximum support in terms of

constrained controller design feasible and tractable. We introduce a new
""system level"" (SL) approach involving three complementary SL elements. System
Level Parameterizations (SLPs) generalize state space and Youla
parameterizations of all stabilizing controllers and the responses they
achieve, and combine with System Level Constraints (SLCs) to parameterize the
largest known class of constrained stabilizing controllers that admit a convex
characterization, generalizing quadratic invariance (QI). SLPs also lead to a
generalization of detectability and stabilizability, suggesting the existence
of a rich separation structure, that when combined with SLCs, is naturally
applicable to structurally constrained controllers and systems. We further
provide a catalog of useful SLCs, most importantly including sparsity, delay,
and locality constraints on both communication and computing internal to the
controller, and external system performance. The resulting System Level
Synthesis (SLS) problems that arise define the broadest known class of
constrained optimal control problems that can be solved using convex

phenomena in underdoped high-Tc cuprates and organic kappa-BEDT-TTF salts. In
calculations, a variational Monte Carlo method is used. In the trial wave
function, a configuration-dependent phase factor, which is vital to treat a
current-carrying state for a large U/t, is introduced in addition to ordinary
correlation factors. Varying U/t, t'/t, and the doping rate (delta)
systematically, we show that the SF state becomes more stable than the normal
state (projected Fermi sea) for a strongly correlated (U/t\gtrsim 5) and
underdoped (delta\lesssim 0.16) area. The decrease in energy is sizable,
particularly in the area where Mott physics prevails and the circular current
(order parameter) is strongly suppressed. These features are consistent with
those for the t-J model. The effect of the frustration t'/t plays a crucial
role in preserving charge homogeneity and appropriately describing the behavior
of hole- and electron-doped cuprates and kappa-BEDT-TTF salts. We argue that
the SF state does not coexist with d-SC and is not a `normal state' from which
d-SC arises. We also show that a spin current (flux or nematic) state is never

importance comes from the fact that these neutrinos point back to the most

their underlying acceleration mechanisms. Atmospheric neutrinos are a

detecting the charged leptons produced in neutrino-nucleon interactions in a
high mass target. We propose to detect the charged leptons, or their decay

a large mass target for the neutrino interactions the Pico de Orizaba volcano,

confidence intervals or sets for parameters of interest. Constructing the
confidence intervals or sets requires understanding the sampling distributions
of the point estimators, which, in many but not all cases, are related to
asymptotic Normal distributions ensured by central limit theorems. Although
previous literature has established various forms of central limit theorems for
statistical inference in super population models, we still need general and
convenient forms of central limit theorems for some randomization-based causal
analysis of experimental data, where the parameters of interests are functions
of a finite population and randomness comes solely from the treatment
assignment. We use central limit theorems for sample surveys and rank
statistics to establish general forms of the finite population central limit
theorems that are particularly useful for proving asymptotic distributions of
randomization tests under the sharp null hypothesis of zero individual causal
effects, and for obtaining the asymptotic repeated sampling distributions of
the causal effect estimators. The new central limit theorems hold for general
experimental designs with multiple treatment levels and multiple treatment
factors, and are immediately applicable for studying the asymptotic properties
of many methods in causal inference, including instrumental variable,
regression adjustment, rerandomization, clustered randomized experiments, and
so on. Previously, the asymptotic properties of these problems are often based
on heuristic arguments, which in fact rely on general forms of finite
population central limit theorems that have not been established before. Our
new theorems fill in this gap by providing more solid theoretical foundation
for asymptotic randomization-based causal inference.

amplitude, leading to a nonlinear wave propagation. Possible applications are
in volcanic, hydrologic, hydrothermal systems as well as for deep oil drilling.
In addition, this formalism could easily be generalized for the case of a
signal arriving in a rock characterized by a steady trend of pressure and/or

also give velocity variations not particularly important. A further heuristic

random autonomous ODE's introduced by Cugliandolo et al. in 1997 to describe
non-relaxational glassy dynamics on the high-dimensional sphere. In doing it we
suggest a new approach which allows such a calculation to be done most
straightforwardly, and is based on efficiently incorporating the Langrange
multiplier into the Kac-Rice framework. Analysing the asymptotic behaviour for
large $N$ we confirm that the phenomenon of 'topology trivialization' revealed
earlier for other systems holds also in the present framework with
nonrelaxational dynamics. Namely, by increasing the variance of the random
'magnetic field' term in dynamical equations we find a 'phase transition' from
the exponentially abundant number of equilibria down to just two equilibria.
Classifying the equilibria in the nontrivial phase by stability remains an open
problem.

rapidly associate with a variety of biomolecules such as proteins and lipids to
form a biocorona. The presence of biocorona influences nano-bio interactions
considerably, and could ultimately result in altered biological responses.
Apolipoprotein A-I (ApoA-I), the major constituent of high-density lipoprotein
(HDL), is one of the most prevalent proteins found in ENM-biocorona
irrespective of ENM nature, size, and shape. Given the importance of ApoA-I in
HDL and cholesterol transport, it is necessary to understand the mechanisms of
ApoA-I adsorption and the associated structural changes for assessing
consequences of ENM exposure. Here, we used a comprehensive array of
microscopic and spectroscopic tools to elucidate the interactions between
ApoA-I and 100 nm Ag nanoparticles (AgNPs) with four different surface
functional groups. We found that the protein adsorption and secondary
structural changes are highly dependent on the surface functionality. Our
electrochemical studies provided new evidence for charge transfer interactions
that influence ApoA-I unfolding. While the unfolding of ApoA-I on AgNPs did not
significantly modify their cellular uptake and short-term cytotoxicity, we
observed that it strongly altered the ability of only some AgNPs to generate
reactive oxygen species in macrophages. Our results shed new light on the
importance of surface functionality and charge transfer interactions in
biocorona formation.

groups of neurons which have grids with similar periodicity, orientation and

variability of the properties of the grids within a module and the range of

with high probability. Larger variability shrinks the range of representation,
providing a functional rationale for the experimentally observed co-modularity

power consumption has become a great challenge for green cloud radio access

a promising solution. Moreover, the increasing number of mobile users (MUs)
causes that admission control is essential for Cloud-RAN with limited fronthaul

joint multiuser downlink beamforming and admission control (JBAC) to enhance

taking into account the Quality of Service requirements of the MUs, the power

optical and infrared (IR) bands. The radial density profile of the IR region
does not show a stellar enhancement in the central region of the cluster. This
stellar deficiency may be occurring by undetected fainter stars due to the
contamination effect of massive stars. Since, our analysis is not indicating
the stellar enhancement below 16.5 mag of I band, therefore the cluster is
assumed to be a group of fainter stars. The proposed magnitude scatter factor
would be an excellent tool to understand the characteristic of
colour-scattering of stars. The most probable members do not coincide with the
model isochronic fitting in the optical bands due to poor data quality of P P
MXL catalogue. The different values of the mean proper motions are found for
the fainter stars of the cluster and field regions, whereas similar values are
obtained for radial zones of the cluster. The symmetrical distribution of
fainter stars of the core are found around the best solution of isochrone. The
mass function and mass segregation studies are not possible due to higher
uncertainty of the photometric data. The number of the massive stars of the
cluster region is low in comparison with the field region due to completed

The particular effects are exerted by a range of electromagnetic wave
frequencies of one-tenth of a Hertz till Peta Hertz, that show a pattern of
twelve bands, if positioned on an acoustic frequency scale. The model was
substantiated by a meta-analysis of 240 published papers of biological
radiation experiments, in which a spectrum of non-thermal electromagnetic waves
were exposed to living cells and intact organisms. These data support the
concept of coherent quantized electromagnetic states in living organisms and
the theories of Davydov, Fr\""ohlich and Pang. A spin-off strategy from our

i.e. a three-phase AC voltage source. The generator does not include any
controller other than the frequency droop loop. This means that the mechanical
torque applied to this generator is an affine function of its angular velocity.
The negative slope of this function is the frequency droop constant. We derive
sufficient conditions on the SG parameters under which there exist exactly two
periodic state trajectories for the SG, one stable and another unstable, and
for almost all initial states, the state trajectory of the SG converges to the
stable periodic trajectory (all the angles are measured modulo $2\pi$). Along
both periodic state trajectories, the angular velocity of the SG is equal to
the grid frequency. Our sufficient conditions are easy to check
computationally. An important tool in our analysis is an integro-differential
equation called the {\em exact swing equation}, which resembles a forced
pendulum equation and is equivalent to our fourth order model of the
grid-connected SG. Apart from our objective of providing an analytical proof
for a global asymptotic behavior observed in a classical dynamical system, a
key motivation for this work is the development of synchronverters which are
inverters that mimic the behavior of SGs. Understanding the global dynamics of

investigate this effect by comparing power spectra, density distribution
functions, halo mass functions, and halo profiles in simulations with and
without these modes. For a simulation with a mass resolution of $m_p \sim
10^{11}\,h^{-1}\,M_{\odot}$, we find that at $z>6$, the difference in the
matter power spectrum is large at wavenumbers above $\sim 80$\% of
$k_{\rm{Ny}}$, reducing to below 2\% at all scales by $z\sim 3$. Including
corner modes results in a better match between low- and high-resolution
simulations at wavenumbers around the Nyquist frequency of the low-resolution

particle discreteness. The differences in mass functions are 3\% for the
smallest halos at $z=6$ for the $m_p \sim 10^{11}\,h^{-1}\,M_{\odot}$

gravitational waves from coalescing compact binaries in the events GW150914 and

holes modeled as equal mass Majumdar-Papapetrou dihole metric and show that
this system displays features that are quite unprecedented and absent in any
other lensing configuration investigated so far. We restrict our attention to
the light rays which move on the plane midway between the two identical black
holes, which allows us to employ techniques developed for the equatorial
lensing in spherically symmetric spacetimes. If distance between the two black
holes is below a certain threshold value, the system admits two photon spheres.
As in the case of single black hole, infinitely many relativistic images are
formed due to the light rays which turn back from the region outside the outer
(unstable) photon sphere, all of which lie beyond a critical angular radius
with respect to the lens. However in the presence of the inner (stable) photon
sphere, the effective potential now increases again and the light rays that
enter the outer photon sphere can turn back, leading to the formation of a new
set of infinitely many relativistic images, all of which lie below the critical
radius from the lens mentioned above. As the distance between the two black
hole increases, two photon spheres approach each other, merge and eventually
disappear. In the absence of photon sphere, apart from the formation of a
finite number of discrete relativistic images, the system remarkably admits a
radial caustic, which has never been observed in the context of relativistic
lensing before. Thus the system of binary black hole admits novel features both
in the presence and absence of photon spheres. We discuss possible
observational signatures and implications of binary black hole lensing.

$y$ should track $r$, i.e., $y\rightarrow r$ as $t\rightarrow\infty$, while the
input of $P$ is only allowed to be in $[u_{min},u_{max}]$. For this, we
introduce a variation of the integrator, called the saturating integrator, and
connect it in feedback with $\bf P$ in the standard way, with gain $k>0$. We
show that for any small enough $k$, the closed-loop system is (locally)
exponentially stable around an equilibrium point $(Xi(u_r),u_r)$, with a large
region of attraction $X_T\subset R^n\times[u_{min},u_{max}]$. When the state
$(x(t),u(t))$ of the closed-loop system converges to $(\Xi(u_r),u_r)$, then the

choosing a larger parameter $T>0$, resulting in smaller $k$.

action of laser fields that couple to the internal and external degrees of
freedom of the ions, we show how to implement effective local dephasing on the
modes, broadening the vibrational resonances. This leads to an overlap of the
local mode frequencies, giving rise to a pronounced increase in the transport
of excitations along the chain. We propose an implementation and measurement
scheme which require neither ground-state cooling nor low heating rates, and we
illustrate our results with a simulation of the dynamics for a chain of three
ions.

supersymmetric particles in pp collisions in final states with two tau leptons.
The data sample corresponds to an integrated luminosity between 18.1 inverse
femtobarns and 19.6 inverse femtobarns depending on the final state of tau
lepton decays, at sqrt(s) = 8 TeV, collected by the CMS experiment at the LHC.
The observed event yields in the signal regions are consistent with the
expected standard model backgrounds. The results are interpreted using
simplified models describing the pair production and decays of charginos or tau
sleptons. For models describing the pair production of the lightest chargino,
exclusion limits are obtained in the plane of chargino mass vs. neutralino mass
under the following assumptions: the chargino decays into third-generation
sleptons, which are taken as the lightest sleptons, and the slepton masses lie
midway between those of the chargino and the neutralino. Chargino masses below
420 GeV are excluded at a 95% confidence level in the limit of a massless
neutralino, and for neutralino masses up to 100 GeV, chargino masses up to 325
GeV are excluded at 95% confidence level. Constraints are also placed on the
cross section for pair production of tau sleptons as a function of mass,
assuming a massless neutralino.

the only Pareto optimal and strategyproof social choice function on the full

around this impossibility theorem. Three grand success stories stand out. On
the domains of single peaked preferences, of house matching, and of quasilinear
preferences, there are appealing Pareto optimal and strategyproof social choice
functions. We investigate whether these success stories are robust to
strengthening strategyproofness to obvious strategyproofness (OSP), recently
introduced by Li (2015).
  For single peaked preferences, we characterize the class of OSP-implementable
and unanimous social choice functions as dictatorships with safeguards against
extremism - mechanisms (which turn out to also be Pareto optimal) in which the
dictator can choose the outcome, but other agents may prevent the dictator from
choosing an outcome that is too extreme. Median voting is consequently not
OSP-implementable. Indeed, the only OSP-implementable quantile rules choose
either the minimal or the maximal ideal point. For house matching, we
characterize the class of OSP-implementable and Pareto optimal matching rules
as sequential barter with lurkers - a significant generalization over bossy
variants of bipolar serially dictatorial rules. While Li (2015) shows that
second-price auctions are OSP-implementable when only one good is sold, we show
that this positive result does not extend to the case of multiple goods. Even
when all agents' preferences over goods are quasilinear and additive, no
welfare-maximizing auction where losers pay nothing is OSP-implementable when
more than one good is sold. Our analysis makes use of a gradual revelation

Either the best ratio measure or the estimated AoD is quantized and fed back to
the transmitter via a feedback channel. The proposed technique can be

Though the design principles are derived assuming a high-power regime,
evaluation under more realistic assumption shows that by employing the proposed
method, good angle estimation performance is achieved under various

bounce back to its original state, which is considered resilient. Here, we
study the resilience of epidemics on networks, by introducing a different
infection rate ${\lambda_{2}}$ during SIS (susceptible-infected-susceptible)
epidemic propagation to model perturbations (control state), whereas the
infection rate is ${\lambda_{1}}$ in the rest of time. Through simulations and
theoretical analysis, we find that even for ${\lambda_{2}<\lambda_{c}}$,
epidemics eventually could bounce back if control duration is below a
threshold. This critical control time for epidemic resilience, i.e.,

Several prior reports have explored ways of automating the analysis of sleep
EEG and of reducing the complexity of the data needed for reliable
discrimination of sleep stages in order to make it possible to perform sleep
studies at lower cost in the home (rather than only in specialized clinical
facilities). However, these reports have involved recordings from electrodes

learning to optimize classification performance with single electrode
recordings. After exploring alternative electrode placements, we found a
comfortable configuration of a single-channel EEG on the forehead and have
shown that it can be integrated with additional electrodes for simultaneous
recording of the electroocuolgram (EOG). Evaluation of data from 62 people
