condense in the zero-momentum state forming a superfluid. Chiral perturbation
theory provides a very powerful tool for studying this phase. However, the
formalism that is usually employed in this context does not clarify various
aspects of the condensation mechanism and makes the identification of the soft
modes problematic. We re-examine the pion condensed phase using different
approaches within the chiral perturbation theory framework. As a first step, we
perform a low-density expansion of the chiral Lagrangian valid close to the
onset of the Bose-Einstein condensation. We obtain an effective theory that can
be mapped to a Gross-Pitaevskii Lagrangian in which, remarkably, all the
coefficients depend on the isospin chemical potential. The low-density
expansion becomes unreliable deep in the pion condensed phase. For this reason,
we develop an alternative field expansion deriving a low-energy Lagrangian
analog to that of quantum magnets. By integrating out the ""radial"" fluctuations
we obtain a soft Lagrangian in terms of the Nambu-Goldstone bosons arising from
the breaking of the pion number symmetry. Finally, we test the robustness of
the second-order transition between the normal and the pion condensed phase
when next-to-leading-order chiral corrections are included. We determine the
range of parameters for turning the second-order phase transition into a
first-order one, finding that the currently accepted values of these
corrections are unlikely to change the order of the phase transition.

evolution of pixel probability density functions (PDF) and one-point statistics
from the simulated maps, comparing them to the measurements derived from
simpler simulations that represent the instrument PSFs with Gaussian kernels.
We find that both methods yield statistics with similar trends with greater
than 80% correlation. We perform additional simulations based on the Hydrogen
Epoch of Reionization Array (HERA), using Gaussian kernels as the instrument
PSFs, and study the effect of frequency binning on the statistics. We find that
PSF smoothing and sampling variance from measuring the statistics over limited
field of view dilute intrinsic features and add fluctuations to the statistics
but reveal new detectable features. Observed kurtosis will increase when a few
extremely high or low temperature regions are present in the maps. Frequency
binning reduces the thermal uncertainty but can also blur regions along the
frequency dimension, resulting in kurtosis peaks that only appear in statistics
derived from maps of certain frequency bins. We further find that the kurtosis
peaks will reach their maxima when the angular resolution of the PSFs match the
size scale of the extreme regions that produce the peaks. The HERA array should
be capable of charting the evolution of the observed skewness and kurtosis of
the 21 cm fluctuations with high sensitivity while the MWA Phase I will likely
be capable of detecting the peak in variance.

  Linear-Quadratic Optimal Control Problems","32 pages, 7 figures",,,,"math.OC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We present a methodology for bounding the error term of an asymptotic
solution to a singularly perturbed optimal control (SPOC) problem whose exact
solution is known to be computationally intractable. In previous works, reduced
or computationally tractable problems that are no longer dependent on the
singular perturbation parameter $\epsilon$, where $\epsilon$ represents a
small, non-negative number, have provided asymptotic error bounds of the form
$O(\epsilon)$. Specifically, the optimal solution $\bar{V}$ of the reduced
problem has been shown to be asymptotically equivalent in $\epsilon$ to the
optimal solution $V(\epsilon)$ of the singularly perturbed problem in the sense
that $|V(\epsilon)-\bar{V}| =O(\epsilon)$ as $\epsilon \rightarrow 0$. In this
paper, we improve on this result by incorporating a duality theory into the
SPOC problem and derive an upper bound $\chi_u(\epsilon)$ and lower bound
$\chi_l(\epsilon)$ of $V(\epsilon)$ that hold for arbitrary $\epsilon$ and,
furthermore, satisfy the inequality $|\chi_u(\epsilon)-\chi_l(\epsilon)| \leq C
\epsilon$ for small $\epsilon$, with the constant $C$ determined. We carry out
numerical experiments to illustrate the computational savings obtained for the
upper and lower bound. In particular, we generate a set of 50 random SPOC
problems of a specific form and show that for $\epsilon$ smaller than
$10^{-2}$, it becomes faster, on average, to solve for the bounds rather than
the SPOC problem and for $\epsilon=10^{-5}$, the computational time for the
upper and lower bounds is approximately 20 times faster, on average, than that
of the SPOC problem.

if the data analyst also use data to select a set of variables and construct
the estimation rule using only the selected variables. In this work, we propose
an asymptotically unbiased estimator for the prediction error after model
search. Under some additional mild assumptions, we show that our estimator
converges to the true prediction error in $L^2$ at the rate of $O(n^{-1/2})$,
with $n$ being the number of data points. Our estimator applies to general
selection procedures, not requiring analytical forms for the selection. The
number of variables to select from can grow as an exponential factor of $n$,
allowing applications in high-dimensional data. It also allows model
misspecifications, not requiring linear underlying models. One application of
our method is that it provides an estimator for the degrees of freedom for many
discontinuous estimation rules like best subset selection or relaxed Lasso.
Connection to Stein's Unbiased Risk Estimator is discussed. We consider
in-sample prediction errors in this work, with some extension to out-of-sample
errors in low dimensional, linear models. Examples such as best subset
selection and relaxed Lasso are considered in simulations, where our estimator
outperforms both $C_p$ and cross validation in various settings.

presented here can be used to test state-of-the-art models of the deuteron and
the two-nucleon interaction in the final state after two-body breakup of the
deuteron. Focusing on polarization degrees of freedom, we gain information on
spin-momentum correlations in the deuteron ground state (due to the D-state
admixture) and on the limits of the Impulse Approximation (IA) picture as it
applies to measurements of spin-dependent observables like spin structure
functions for bound nucleons. We measured the beam-target double spin asymmetry
for quasi-elastic electron scattering off the deuteron at several beam energies
using the CEBAF Large Acceptance Spectrometer (CLAS) at the Thomas Jefferson
National Accelerator Facility. The deuterons were polarized along (or opposite
to) the beam direction. The double spin asymmetries were measured as a function
of photon virtuality , missing momentum, and the angle between the (inferred)
""spectator"" neutron and the momentum transfer direction. The results are
compared with a recent model that includes Final State Interactions (FSI) using
a complete parameterization of nucleon-nucleon scattering, as well as a
simplified model using the Plane Wave Impulse Approximation (PWIA). We find
overall good agreement with both the PWIA and FSI expectations at low to medium
missing momenta, including the change of the asymmetry due to the contribution
of the deuteron D-state at higher momenta. At the highest missing momenta, our
data clearly agree better with the calculations including FSI.

energy injection at the scale of constituent particles. At larger scales,
described by coarse-grained models, the global entropy production rate S
quantifies the probability ratio of forward and reversed dynamics and hence the
importance of irreversibility at such scales: it vanishes whenever the
coarse-grained dynamics of the active system reduces to that of an effective
equilibrium model. We evaluate S for a class of scalar stochastic field
theories describing the coarse-grained density of self-propelled particles
without alignment interactions, capturing such key phenomena as
motility-induced phase separation. We show how the entropy production can be
decomposed locally (in real space) or spectrally (in Fourier space), allowing
detailed examination of the spatial structure and correlations that underly
departures from equilibrium. For phase-separated systems, the local entropy
production is concentrated mainly on interfaces with a bulk contribution that
tends to zero in the weak-noise limit. In homogeneous states, we find a
generalized Harada-Sasa relation that directly expresses the entropy production
in terms of the wavevector-dependent deviation from the fluctuation-dissipation
relation between response functions and correlators. We discuss extensions to
the case where the particle density is coupled to a momentum-conserving
solvent, and to situations where the particle current, rather than the density,
should be chosen as the dynamical field. We expect the new conceptual tools
developed here to be broadly useful in the context of active matter, allowing
one to distinguish when and where activity plays an essential role in the
dynamics.

of common sedimentary minerals that is used by the geoscience community for
geochronology. This method is advantageous because of the ease of measurement
on ubiquitous quartz and feldspar sand. We develop a model based on
conservation of energy and sediment mass to explain the patterns of
luminescence in river channel sediment from a first-principles perspective. We
show that the model can accurately reproduce the luminescence observed in
previously published field measurements from two rivers with very different
sediment transport styles. The parameters from the model can then be used to
estimate the time-averaged virtual velocity, characteristic transport
lengthscales, storage timescales, and floodplain exchange rates of fine
sand-sized sediment in a fluvial system. The values obtained from the

some thermodynamic and baryon transport results obtained from a bottom-up
Einstein-Maxwell-Dilaton holographic model engineered to describe the physics
of the quark-gluon plasma at finite temperature and baryon density. The results
for the equation of state, baryon susceptibilities, and the curvature of the
crossover band are in quantitative agreement with the corresponding lattice QCD
results with $2+1$ flavors and physical quark masses. Baryon diffusion is
predicted to be suppressed by increasing the baryon chemical potential.

some of them do not, in fact, qualify for this function. The best sources from
our selections consist of a cascade of two-level systems, improving on the

with localized muscle weakness. Progressive, widespread paralysis often follows
over a few years. Does the disease begin with local changes in a small piece of
neural tissue and then spread? Or does neural decay happen independently across
diverse spatial locations? The distinction matters, because local initiation
may arise by local changes in a tissue microenvironment, by somatic mutation,
or by various epigenetic or regulatory fluctuations in a few cells. A local
trigger must be coupled with a mechanism for spread. By contrast, independent
decay across spatial locations cannot begin by a local change, but must depend
on some global predisposition or spatially distributed change that leads to
approximately synchronous decay. This article outlines the conceptual frame by
which one contrasts local triggers and spread versus parallel spatially
distributed decay. Various neurodegenerative diseases differ in their
mechanistic details, but all can usefully be understood as falling along a
continuum of interacting local and global processes. Cancer provides an example
of disease progression by local triggers and spatial spread, setting a
conceptual basis for clarifying puzzles in neurodegeneration. Heart disease
also has crucial interactions between global processes, such as circulating
lipid levels, and local processes in the development of atherosclerotic
plaques. The distinction between local and global processes helps to understand
these various age-related diseases.

(Bodlaender et al. [FOCS 2009], Fomin et al. [SODA 2010], Kim et al. [ICALP
2013]) guaranteeing the existence of linear kernels on sparse graphs for
problems satisfying some generic conditions. The drawback of such general
results is that it is usually not clear how to derive from them constructive
kernels with reasonably low explicit constants. To fill this gap, we recently
presented [STACS 2014] a framework to obtain explicit linear kernels for some
families of problems whose solutions can be certified by a subset of vertices.
In this article we enhance our framework to deal with packing problems, that
is, problems whose solutions can be certified by collections of subgraphs of
the input graph satisfying certain properties. ${\mathcal F}$-Packing is a
typical example: for a family ${\mathcal F}$ of connected graphs that we assume
to contain at least one planar graph, the task is to decide whether a graph $G$
contains $k$ vertex-disjoint subgraphs such that each of them contains a graph
in ${\mathcal F}$ as a minor. We provide explicit linear kernels on sparse
graphs for the following two orthogonal generalizations of ${\mathcal
F}$-Packing: for an integer $\ell \geq 1$, one aims at finding either
minor-models that are pairwise at distance at least $\ell$ in $G$
($\ell$-${\mathcal F}$-Packing), or such that each vertex in $G$ belongs to at
most $\ell$ minors-models (${\mathcal F}$-Packing with $\ell$-Membership).
Finally, we also provide linear kernels for the versions of these problems
where one wants to pack subgraphs instead of minors.

are consistent with a GS model that contains a smooth deficit of
parallel-propagating waves and a broad resonance function, though some other
possibilities cannot, as yet, be ruled out. In particular, isotropic fast
magnetosonic wave turbulence can match the observations at high energy, but
cannot accommodate an energy dependence in the shape of the CR anisotropy. Our
findings suggest that improved data on the large-scale CR anisotropy could
provide a valuable probe of the properties - notably the power-spectrum - of
the interstellar turbulence within a few tens of parsecs from Earth.

transport is quantified by expressing the Reynolds stress in terms of stable

$a^4$, only certain types of fluctuations are allowed. Normal coordinates are
used to avoid redundancy of the degrees of freedom. The relevant integration
measure is read off from the metric on metrics. All fluctuations in a group of
cells are averaged over to get an effective action for the larger cell. In this
paper the simplest type of fluctuations are kept. The measure is simply an
integration over independent components of the curvature tensor at the center
of each cell. Terms of higher order in $a$ are required for convergence in case
of Einstein-Hilbert action. With only next order (in $a$) contribution to the
action, there is no renormalization of Newton's or cosmological constants. The

actions that have linear and quadratic terms in curvature and determines the

$G$, a constant $\rho \in [0, 1]$ and an initial set $A \subseteq V(G)$ of
\emph{infected} vertices, at each step a vertex~$v$ becomes infected if at
least a $\rho$-proportion of its neighbours are already infected (once
infected, a vertex remains infected forever). Our focus is on the size
$h_\rho(G)$ of a smallest initial set which is \emph{contagious}, meaning that
this process results in the infection of every vertex of $G$.
  Our main result states that every connected graph $G$ on $n$ vertices has
$h_\rho(G) < 2\rho n$ or $h_\rho(G) = 1$ (note that allowing the latter
possibility is necessary because of the case $\rho\leq\tfrac{1}{2n}$, as every
contagious set has size at least one). This is the best-possible bound of this
form, and improves on previous results of Chang and Lyuu and of Gentner and
Rautenbach. We also provide a stronger bound for graphs of girth at least five
and sufficiently small $\rho$, which is asymptotically best-possible.

a simulated Lennard-Jones fluid to cover higher-density and lower-temperature

allows for a full account and understanding of the dynamical processes
encompassed by a fundamental quantity as the VAF. In particular, besides
obtaining evidence of a persisting long-time tail, we assign specific and
unambiguous physical meanings to groups of exponential modes related to the
longitudinal and transverse collective dynamics, respectively. We have made
this possible by consistently introducing the interpretation of the VAF
frequency spectrum as a global density of states in fluids, generalizing a
solid-state concept, and by giving to specific spectral components, obtained
via the VAF exponential expansion, the corresponding meaning of partial
densities of states relative to specific dynamical processes. The clear
identification of a high-frequency oscillation of the VAF with the near-top
excitation frequency in the dispersion curve of acoustic waves is a neat
example of the power of the method. As for the transverse mode contribution,
its analysis turns out to be particularly important, because the
multiexponential expansion reveals a transition marking the onset of
propagating excitations when the density is increased above a threshold value.
While this finding agrees with recent literature debating the issue of
dynamical crossover boundaries, such as the one identified with the Frenkel
line, we can add detailed information on the modes involved in this specific
process in the domains of both time and frequency. This will help obtain a
still missing full account of transverse dynamics, in its nonpropagating and
propagating aspects which are linked by dynamical transitions depending on both
the thermodynamic states and the excitation wavevectors.

distribution ($\mathrm{EM}(T)$) peaks at $T = T_m$, we find that
$\mathrm{EM}(T_m)$ is independent of details of the nanoflare train, and
$\mathrm{EM}(T)$ above and below $T_m$ reflects different aspects of the
heating. Below $T_m$ the main influence is the relationship of the waiting time
between successive nanoflares to the nanoflare energy. Above $T_m$ power-law
nanoflare distributions lead to an extensive plasma population not present in a
monoenergetic train. Furthermore, in some cases characteristic features are
present in $\mathrm{EM}(T)$. Such details may be detectable given adequate
spectral resolution and a good knowledge of the relevant atomic physics. In the

into an era of observational GW astrophysics. Compact binaries remain the
primary target sources for LIGO, of which neutron star-black hole (NSBH)
binaries form an important subset. GWs from NSBH sources carry signatures of
(a) the tidal distortion of the neutron star by its companion black hole during
inspiral, and (b) its potential tidal disruption near merger. In this paper, we
present a Bayesian study of the measurability of neutron star tidal
deformability $\Lambda_\mathrm{NS}\propto (R/M)^{5}$ using observation(s) of
inspiral-merger GW signals from disruptive NSBH coalescences, taking into
account the crucial effect of black hole spins. First, we find that if
non-tidal templates are used to estimate source parameters for an NSBH signal,
the bias introduced in the estimation of non-tidal physical parameters will
only be significant for loud signals with signal-to-noise ratios $> 30$. For
similarly loud signals, we also find that we can begin to put interesting
constraints on $\Lambda_\mathrm{NS}$ (factor of 1-2) with individual
observations. Next, we study how a population of realistic NSBH detections will
improve our measurement of neutron star tidal deformability. For astrophysical
populations of $disruptive$ NSBH mergers, we find 20-35 events to be sufficient
to constrain $\Lambda_\mathrm{NS}$ within $\pm 25-50\%$, depending on the
chosen equation of state. In this we also assume that LIGO will detect black
holes with masses within the astrophysical $mass$-$gap$. If the mass-gap
remains preserved in NSBHs detected by LIGO, we estimate that $25\%$
$additional$ detections will furnish comparable tidal measurement accuracy. In
both cases, we find that the loudest 5-10 events to provide most of the tidal

nebula (CN), and extended tail. We find that the CN morphology can be
interpreted in a way that suggests a small angle between the pulsar spin axis
and our line-of-sight, as inferred from the radio data. On larger scales,
emission from the 7' (2 pc) tail is clearly seen. We also found hints of two
faint extensions nearly orthogonal to the direction of the pulsar's proper
motion. The spectrum extracted at the pulsar position can be described with an
absorbed power-law + blackbody model. The nonthermal component can be
attributed to magnetospheric emission, while the thermal component can be
attributed to emission from either a hot spot (e.g., a polar cap) or the entire
neutron star surface. Surprisingly, the spectrum of the tail shows only a
slight hint of cooling with increasing distance from the pulsar. This implies
either a low magnetic field with fast flow speed, or particle re-acceleration
within the tail. We estimate physical properties of the PWN and compare the
morphologies of the CN and the extended tail with those of other bow shock PWNe
observed with long CXO exposures.

information in lattices of qubits by deriving tradeoff bounds for approximate

correctability and code distance, and give a number of equivalent formulations

bounds relate the number of physical qubits $n$, the number of encoded qubits
$k$, the code distance $d$, the accuracy parameter $\delta$ that quantifies how
well the erasure channel can be reversed, and the locality parameter $\ell$
that specifies the length scale at which the recovery operation can be done. In
a regime where the recovery is successful to accuracy $\epsilon$ that is
exponentially small in $\ell$, which is the case for perturbations of local
commuting projector codes, our bound reads $kd^{\frac{2}{D-1}} \le O\bigl(n
(\log n)^{\frac{2D}{D-1}} \bigr)$ for codes on $D$-dimensional lattices of
Euclidean metric. We also find that the code distance of any local approximate
code cannot exceed $O\bigl(\ell n^{(D-1)/D}\bigr)$ if $\delta \le O(\ell
n^{-1/D})$. As a corollary of our formulation of correctability in terms of
logical operator avoidance, we show that the code distance $d$ and the size
$\tilde d$ of a minimal region that can support all approximate logical
operators satisfies $\tilde d d^{\frac{1}{D-1}}\le O\bigl( n
\ell^{\frac{D}{D-1}} \bigr)$, where the logical operators are accurate up to
$O\bigl( ( n \delta / d )^{1/2}\bigr)$ in operator norm. Finally, we prove that
for two-dimensional systems if logical operators can be approximated by
operators supported on constant-width flexible strings, then the dimension of
the code space must be bounded. This supports one of the assumptions of
algebraic anyon theories, that there exist only finitely many anyon types.

tracers of the dark matter. However, the clustering statistics of tracers are
biased and depend on various properties, such as their host-halo mass and
assembly history. On very large scales this tracer bias results in a constant
offset in the clustering amplitude, known as linear bias. Towards smaller
nonlinear scales, this is no longer the case and tracer bias becomes a
complicated function of scale and time. We focus on tracer bias centred on
cosmic voids, depressions of the density field that spatially dominate the
universe. We consider three types of tracers: galaxies, galaxy clusters and
AGN, extracted from the hydrodynamical simulation Magneticum Pathfinder. In
contrast to common clustering statistics that focus on auto-correlations of
tracers, we find that void-tracer cross-correlations are successfully described
by a linear-bias relation. The tracer-density profile of voids can thus be
related to their matter-density profile by a single number. We show that it
coincides with the linear tracer bias extracted from the large-scale
auto-correlation function and expectations from theory, if sufficiently large
voids are considered. For smaller voids we observe a shift towards higher
values. This has important consequences on cosmological parameter inference, as
the problem of unknown tracer bias is alleviated up to a constant number. The
smallest scales in existing datasets become accessible to simpler models,
providing numerous modes of the density field that have been disregarded so
far, but may help to further reduce statistical errors in constraining
cosmology.

cosmic rays (CRs) in the GeV-TeV energy region. The two spectra are found to
progressively harden at rigidity $R = pc/Z >\,$200 GV, while the p/He ratio is
found to fall off steadily as $p/He\sim\,R^{-0.08}$. The p/He decrease is often
interpreted in terms of particle-dependent acceleration, which is in contrast
with the universal nature of DSA mechanisms. A different explanation is that
the p-He anomaly reflects a flux transition between two components: a sub-TeV
flux component (L) provided by hydrogen-rich supernova remnants with soft
acceleration spectra, and a multi-TeV component (G) injected by younger sources
with amplified magnetic fields and hard spectra. In this scenario the
universality of particle acceleration is not violated because both sources
provide composition-blind injection spectra. The present work is aimed at
testing this model using the low-energy CR flux which is expected to be
L-dominated. However, at $E\sim\,$0.5-10 GeV, the fluxes are affected by energy
losses and solar modulation for which a proper modeling is required. To set the
properties of the L-source, I have used the Voyager-1 data collected in the
interstellar space. To compare my calculations with the AMS data, I have
performed a determination of the force-field modulation parameter using neutron
monitor measurements. I will show that the recent $p-He$ data reported by AMS
and Voyager-1 are in good agreement with the predictions of such a scenario,
supporting the hypothesis that CRs are injected in the Galaxy by universal,
composition-blind accelerators. At energies below $\sim\,$0.5 GeV/n, however,
the model is found to underpredict the data collected by PAMELA from 2006 to
2010. This discrepancy is found to increase with increasing solar activity,
reflecting an expected breakdown of the force-field approximation.

indeed produce multiply peaked energy spectra. We explore the dependence of the

quantum spin liquids in the geometrically frustrated hyperkagome lattice of
Ir$^{4+}$ ions. In this work, we consider quantum spin liquids on hyperkagome
lattice for generic spin models, focusing on the effects of anisotropic spin
interactions. In particular, we classify possible $\mathbb{Z}_2$ and $U(1)$
spin liquid states, following the projective symmetry group analysis in the
slave-fermion representation. There are only three distinct $\mathbb{Z}_2$ spin
liquids, together with 2 different $U(1)$ spin liquids. The non-symmorphic
space group symmetry of hyperkagome lattice plays a vital role in simplifying
the classification, forbidding ""$\pi$-flux"" or ""staggered-flux"" phases in
contrast to symmorphic space groups. We further prove that both $U(1)$ states
and one $Z_2$ state among all 3 are symmetry-protected gapless spin liquids,
robust against any symmetry-preserving perturbations. Motivated by the
""spin-freezing"" behavior recently observed in Na$_4$Ir$_3$O$_8$ at low
temperatures, we further investigate the nearest-neighbor spin model with
dominant Heisenberg interaction subject to all possible anisotropic
perturbations from spin-orbit couplings. We found a $U(1)$ spin liquid ground
state with spinon fermi surfaces is energetically favored over $Z_2$ states.
Among all spin-orbit coupling terms, we show that only Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya
(DM) interaction can induce spin anisotropy in the ground state when perturbing
from the isotropic Heisenberg limit. Our work paves the way for a systematic
study of quantum spin liquids in various materials with a hyperkagome crystal
structure.

radiation and gas pressures, are studied using a set of new analytical
solutions. While the Toomre parameter of the disc remains close to its critical
value for the onset of gravitational instability, the dimensionless stress
parameter is uniquely determined from the thermal energy reservoir of the disc
and its cooling rate. Our solutions are applicable to the accretion discs with
dynamically important radiation pressure like in the quasars discs. We show
that physical quantities of a gravitoturbulent disc in the presence of
radiation are significantly modified compared to solutions with only gas
pressure. We show that the dimensionless stress parameter is an increasing
function of the radial distance so that its steepness strongly depends on the
accretion rate. In a disc without radiation its slope is 4.5, however, we show
that in the presence of radiation, it varies between 2 and 4.5 depending on the
accretion rate and the central mass. As for the surface density, we find a
shallower profile with an exponent -2 in a disc with sub-Eddington accretion
rate compared to a similar disc, but without radiation, where its surface
density slope is -3 independent of the accretion rate. We then investigate
gravitational stability of the disc when the stress parameter reaches to its
critical value. In order to self-consistently determine the fragmentation
boundary, however, it is shown that the critical value of the stress parameter
is a power-law function of the ratio of gas pressure and the total pressure and
its exponent is around 1.7. We also estimate the maximum mass of the central

approach to VPP using this score function, and (iii) we cast VPP as a Markovian

breaking terms receive comparable anomaly-mediation and moduli-mediation
contributions leading to the phenomenon of mirage unification. The simplest MM
SUSY breaking models which are consistent with the measured Higgs mass and
sparticle mass constraints are strongly disfavoured by fine-tuning
considerations. However, while MM makes robust predictions for gaugino masses,
the scalar sector is quite sensitive to specific mechanisms for moduli
stabilization and potential uplifting. We suggest here a broader setup of
generalized mirage mediation (GMM), where heretofore discrete parameters are
allowed as continuous to better parametrize these other schemes. We find that
natural SUSY spectra consistent with both the measured value of m(h). as well
as LHC lower bounds on superpartner masses are then possible. We explicitly
show that models generated from natural GMM may be beyond the reach of even
high-luminosity LHC searches. In such a case, the proposed International Linear
e^+e^- Collider (ILC) will be required for natural SUSY discovery via higgsino
pair production reactions. We also outline prospects for detection of
higgsino-like WIMPs from natural GMM.

350$\mu$m and 500$\mu$m. The spectra include near complete CO ladders for over

three classes based on their excitation. We find that the mid-J (5$<$J$<$8)
lines are better correlated with the total far-infrared luminosity, suggesting
that the warm gas component is closely linked to recent star-formation. The
higher J transitions do not linearly correlate with the far-infrared

theoretical guarantees characterizing the capacity of the structured model in

do. Thus, we expect the sliced correlation function to be useful in
constraining the growth factor, and modified gravity theories that involve the
local density. Out of the studied cases, we find that the run of the BAO peak
location with density is best revealed when slicing on a $\sim 40$ Mpc/$h$

most useful in distinguishing between underdense and overdense regions, whose

However, considerable uncertainty exists as to planetary conditions and hence
surface UV at abiogenesis. Here, we present two-stream multi-layer clear-sky
calculations of the UV surface radiance on Earth at 3.9 Ga to constrain the UV
surface fluence as a function of albedo, solar zenith angle (SZA), and
atmospheric composition. Variation in albedo and latitude (through SZA) can
affect maximum photoreaction rates by a factor of >10.4; for the same
atmosphere, photoreactions can proceed an order of magnitude faster at the
equator of a snowball Earth than at the poles of a warmer world. Surface
conditions are important considerations when computing prebiotic UV fluences.
For climatically reasonable levels of CO2, fluence shortward of 189 nm is
screened out, meaning that prebiotic chemistry is robustly shielded from
variations in UV fluence due to solar flares or variability. Strong shielding
from CO2 also means that the UV surface fluence is insensitive to plausible
levels of CH4, O2, and O3. At scattering wavelengths, UV fluence drops off
comparatively slowly with increasing CO2 levels. However, if SO2 and/or H2S can
build up to the 1-100 ppm level as hypothesized by some workers, then they can
dramatically suppress surface fluence and hence prebiotic photoprocesses. H2O
is a robust UV shield for <198 nm. This means that regardless of the levels of
other atmospheric gases, fluence <198 nm is only available for cold, dry
atmospheres, meaning sources with emission <198 nm (e.g. ArF eximer lasers) can
only be used in simulations of cold environments with low abundance of
volcanogenic gases. On the other hand, fluence at 254 nm is unshielded by H2O
and is available across a broad range of CO2 columns, meaning that mercury
lamps are suitable for initial studies regardless of the uncertainty in
primordial H2O and CO2 levels.

transfer of dependency parsers, in the scenario where a large amount of
translation data is not available. The method makes use of three steps: 1) a
method for deriving cross-lingual word clusters, which can then be used in a
multilingual parser; 2) a method for transferring lexical information from a
target language to source language treebanks; 3) a method for integrating these
steps with the density-driven annotation projection method of Rasooli and
Collins (2015). Experiments show improvements over the state-of-the-art in
several languages used in previous work, in a setting where the only source of
translation data is the Bible, a considerably smaller corpus than the Europarl

understanding and manipulating the topological properties of physical systems
is essential in advancing quantum science and technology. For quantum
computation, topologically protected qubit operations can increase
computational robustness, and for metrology the quantized Hall effect directly
defines the von Klitzing constant. Fundamentally, topological order is
generated by singularities called topological defects in extended spaces, and
is quantified in terms of Chern numbers, each of which measures different sorts
of fields traversing surfaces enclosing these topological singularities. Here,
inspired by high energy theories, we describe our synthesis and
characterization of a singularity present in non-Abelian gauge theories - a
Yang monopole - using atomic Bose-Einstein condensates in a five-dimensional
space, and quantify the monopole in terms of Chern numbers measured on
enclosing manifolds. While the well-known 1st Chern number vanished, the 2nd
Chern number, measured for the first time in any physical settings, did not. By
displacing the manifold, we then observed a phase transition from ""topological""
to ""trivial"" as the monopole left the manifold.

types of orientational order, like nematic, polar nematic, polar smectic, and
active polar order. In particular, we present hydrodynamic equations for
phases, where only tetrahedral order exists or tetrahedral order is combined
with nematic order. Among the latter we discriminate between three cases, where
the nematic director (a) orients along a 4-fold, or (b) along a 3-fold symmetry
axis of the tetrahedral structure. For the optically isotropic T_d phase, which
only has tetrahedral order, we focus on the coupling of flow with e.g.
temperature gradients and on the specific orientation behavior in external
electric fields. For the transition to the nematic phase, electric fields lead
to a temperature shift that is linear in the field strength. Electric fields
induce nematic order, again linear in the field strength. If strong enough,
electric fields can change the tetrahedral structure and symmetry leading to a
polar phase. We briefly deal with the T phase that arises when tetrahedral
order occurs in a system of chiral molecules. To case (a) belong (i) the
non-polar, achiral, optically uniaxial D2d phase with ambidextrous helicity and
with orientational frustration in external fields, (ii) the non-polar
tetragonal S4 phase, (iii) the non-polar, orthorhombic D2 phase that is
structurally chiral featuring ambidextrous chirality, (iv) the polar
orthorhombic C2v phase, and (v) the polar monoclinic C2 phase. Case (b) results
in a trigonal C3v phase that behaves like a biaxial polar nematic phase.
Finally we discuss some experiments that show typical effects related to the
existence of tetrahedral order.

pulse. This phonon is known to couple relatively strongly to electrons.
Cross-correlating effective electronic and phonon temperatures places new
constraints on model-based fits. The accepted two-temperature model predicts
that G-phonon population should start to increase as soon as excited
electron-hole pairs are created and that the rate of increase should not depend
strongly on the pump fluence. Instead we found that the increase of the
G-phonon population occurs with a delay of $\sim$65 fs. This time-delay is also
evidenced by the absence of the so-called self-pumping for G phonons. It
decreases with increased pump fluence. We show that these observations imply a
new relaxation pathway: Instead of hot carriers transferring energy to
G-phonons directly, the energy is first transferred to optical phonons near the
zone boundary K-points, which then decay into G-phonons via phonon-phonon
scattering. Our work demonstrates that phonon-phonon interactions must be
included in any calculations of hot carrier relaxation in optical absorbers

separation based on the assumption that sources are statistically independent.
Though ICA has proven useful and has been employed in many applications,
complete statistical independence can be too restrictive an assumption in

sparsity, is usually available. Sparsity is a natural property of the data, a
form of diversity, which, if incorporated into the ICA model, can relax the

performance. In this work, we propose a new variant of ICA by entropy bound

suspend the accounts of such extremists in response to user complaints. The
challenge is that these extremist users simply create new accounts and continue
their activities. In this work we present a new set of operational capabilities
to deal with the threat posed by online extremists in social networks.
  Using data from several hundred thousand extremist accounts on Twitter, we
develop a behavioral model for these users, in particular what their accounts
look like and who they connect with. This model is used to identify new
extremist accounts by predicting if they will be suspended for extremist
activity. We also use this model to track existing extremist users as they
create new accounts by identifying if two accounts belong to the same user.
Finally, we present a model for searching the social network to efficiently
find suspended users' new accounts based on a variant of the classic Polya's
urn setup. We find a simple characterization of the optimal search policy for
this model under fairly general conditions. Our urn model and main theoretical
results generalize easily to search problems in other fields.

often translates to identifying low density regions. Major problems arise when
data is high-dimensional and mixed of discrete and continuous attributes. We
propose MIXMAD, which stands for MIXed data Multilevel Anomaly Detection, an
ensemble method that estimates the sparse regions across multiple levels of
abstraction of mixed data. The hypothesis is for domains where multiple data
abstractions exist, a data point may be anomalous with respect to the raw
representation or more abstract representations. To this end, our method
sequentially constructs an ensemble of Deep Belief Nets (DBNs) with varying
depths. Each DBN is an energy-based detector at a predefined abstraction level.
At the bottom level of each DBN, there is a Mixed-variate Restricted Boltzmann
Machine that models the density of mixed data. Predictions across the ensemble
are finally combined via rank aggregation. The proposed MIXMAD is evaluated on
high-dimensional realworld datasets of different characteristics. The results
demonstrate that for anomaly detection, (a) multilevel abstraction of
high-dimensional and mixed data is a sensible strategy, and (b) empirically,
MIXMAD is superior to popular unsupervised detection methods for both
homogeneous and mixed data.

predictive of multiple dynamic properties of the networks. Conventionally, a
graph structure is represented using an adjacency matrix or a set of
hand-crafted structural features. These representations either fail to
highlight local and global properties of the graph or suffer from a severe loss
of structural information. There lacks an effective graph representation, which
hinges the realization of the predictive power of network structures.
  In this study, we propose to learn the represention of a graph, or the
topological structure of a network, through a deep learning model. This
end-to-end prediction model, named DeepGraph, takes the input of the raw
adjacency matrix of a real-world network and outputs a prediction of the growth
of the network. The adjacency matrix is first represented using a graph
descriptor based on the heat kernel signature, which is then passed through a
multi-column, multi-resolution convolutional neural network. Extensive
experiments on five large collections of real-world networks demonstrate that
the proposed prediction model significantly improves the effectiveness of
existing methods, including linear or nonlinear regressors that use
hand-crafted features, graph kernels, and competing deep learning methods.

emerged as a new class of spin labels for distance determination by pulsed EPR
spectroscopy at Q- and W-band. We present CW EPR measurements at 240 GHz (8.6
Tesla) on a series of Gd-rulers of the type Gd-PyMTA---spacer---Gd-PyMTA, with
Gd-Gd distances ranging from 1.2 nm to 4.3 nm. CW EPR measurements of these
Gd-rulers show that significant dipolar broadening of the central
$|-1/2\rangle\rightarrow|1/2\rangle$ transition occurs at 30 K for Gd-Gd
distances up to $\sim$ 3.4 nm with Gd-PyMTA as the spin label. This represents
a significant extension for distances accessible by CW EPR, as nitroxide-based
spin labels at X-band frequencies can typically only access distances up to
$\sim$ 2 nm. We show that this broadening persists at biologically relevant
temperatures above 200 K, and that this method is further extendable up to room
temperature by immobilizing the sample in glassy trehalose. We show that the
peak-to-peak broadening of the central transition follows the expected $~1/r^3$
dependence for the electron-electron dipolar interaction, from cryogenic
temperatures up to room temperature. A simple procedure for simulating the
dependence of the lineshape on interspin distance is presented, in which the
broadening of the central transition is modeled as an $S=1/2$ spin whose CW EPR
lineshape is broadened through electron-electron dipolar interactions with a
neighboring $S=7/2$ spin.

mobility, about 30 times higher than that of the prototypical SrTiO$_3$. Using
first-principles calculations based on hybrid density functional theory, we
elucidate the physical mechanisms that govern the mobility by studying the
details of LO-phonon and ionized impurity scattering. A careful numerical
analysis to obtain converged results within the relaxation-time approximation
of Boltzmann transport theory is presented. The ${\bf k}$ dependence of the
relaxation time is fully taken into account. We find that the high RT mobility
in BSO originates not only from a small effective mass, but also from a
significant reduction in the phonon scattering rate compared to other
perovskite oxides; the origins of this reduction are identified. Ionized
impurity scattering influences the total mobility even at RT for dopant
densities larger than $5\times10^{18}$ cm$^{-3}$, and becomes comparable to
LO-phonon scattering for $1\times10^{20}$ cm$^{-3}$ doping, reducing the drift
mobility from its intrinsic LO-phonon-limited value of $\sim$594
cm$^{2}$V$^{-1}$s$^{-1}$ to less than 310 cm$^{2}$V$^{-1}$s$^{-1}$. We suggest
pathways to avoid impurity scattering via modulation doping or polar
discontinuity doping. We also explicitly calculate the Hall factor and Hall
mobility, allowing a direct comparison to experimental reports for bulk and
thin films and providing insights into the nature of the dominant mechanisms

collisions a 1D cylindrical-quadrupole component of 2D angular correlations
conventionally denoted by quantity $v_2$ is interpreted to represent elliptic
flow: azimuth modulation of transverse or radial flow in noncentral
nucleus-nucleus (A-A) collisions. The nonjet (NJ) quadrupole component exhibits
various properties inconsistent with a flow or hydro interpretation, including
the observation that NJ-quadrupole centrality variation in $A$-$A$ collisions
has no relation to strongly-varying jet modification (""jet quenching"") in those
collisions commonly attributed to jet interaction with a dense flowing medium.
In the present study I report isolation of quadrupole spectra from
$p_t$-differential $v_2(p_t)$ data obtained at the relativistic heavy ion
collider (RHIC) and large hadron collider (LHCr). I demonstrate that NJ
quadrupole spectra have characteristics very different from the single-particle
spectra for most hadrons, that quadrupole spectra indicate a common boosted
hadron source for a small minority of hadrons that ""carry"" the quadrupole
structure, that the narrow source-boost distribution is characteristic of an
expanding thin cylindrical shell (also strongly contradicting a hydro
interpretation), and that in the boost frame a single universal quadrupole
spectrum (L\'evy distribution) on transverse mass $m_t$ accurately describes
data for several hadron species scaled according to their statistical-model
abundances. The quadrupole spectrum shape changes very little from RHIC to LHC
energies. Taken in combination those characteristics strongly suggest a unique
{\em nonflow} (and nonjet) QCD mechanism for the NJ quadrupole conventionally

enhancing the physical-layer security of a two-tier decentralized wireless
network with each tier deployed with a large number of pairs of a
single-antenna transmitter and a multi-antenna receiver. In the underlying
tier, the transmitter sends unclassified information, and the receiver works in
the halfduplex (HD) mode receiving the desired signal. In the overlaid tier,
the transmitter deliveries confidential information in the presence of randomly
located eavesdroppers, and the receiver works in the FD mode radiating jamming
signals to confuse eavesdroppers and receiving the desired signal
simultaneously. We provide a comprehensive performance analysis and network
design under a stochastic geometry framework. Specifically, we consider the
scenarios where each FD receiver uses single- and multi-antenna jamming, and
analyze the connection probability and the secrecy outage probability of a
typical FD receiver by providing accurate expressions and more tractable
approximations for the two metrics. We further determine the optimal deployment
of the FD-mode tier in order to maximize networkwide secrecy throughput subject
to constraints including the given dual probabilities and the network-wide
throughput of the HD-mode tier. Numerical results are demonstrated to verify
our theoretical findings, and show that network-wide secrecy throughput is
significantly improved by properly deploying the FD-mode tier.

for general relativistic hydrodynamic (GRHD) equations, equipped with a general
equation of state. Here the physical constraints, describing the admissible
states of GRHD, are referred to the subluminal constraint on the fluid velocity
and the positivity of the density, pressure and specific internal energy.
Preserving these constraints is very important for robust computations,
otherwise violating one of them will lead to the ill-posed problem and
numerical instability. To overcome the difficulties arising from the inherent
strong nonlinearity contained in the constraints, we derive an equivalent
definition of the admissible states. Using this definition, we prove the
convexity, scaling invariance and Lax-Friedrichs (LxF) splitting property of
the admissible state set $\mathcal G$, and discover the dependence of $\mathcal
G$ on the spacetime metric. Unfortunately, such dependence yields the
non-equivalence of $\mathcal G$ at different points in curved spacetime, and
invalidates the convexity of $\mathcal G$ in analyzing PCP schemes. This
obstacle is effectively overcame by introducing a new formulation of the GRHD
equations. Based on this formulation and the above theories, a first-order LxF
scheme is designed on general unstructured mesh and rigorously proved to be PCP
under a CFL condition. With two types of PCP limiting procedures, we design
high-order, {\em provably} (not probably) PCP methods under discretization on
the proposed new formulation. These high-order methods include the PCP finite
difference, finite volume and discontinuous Galerkin methods.

to be ""of disjoint type"". It is known that a disjoint-type function provides a
model for the dynamics near infinity of all maps in the same parameter space;
hence a good understanding of these functions has implications in wider
generality.
  Our goal is to study the topological properties of the Julia sets of entire
functions of disjoint type. In particular, we give a detailed description of
the topology of their connected components. More precisely, consider a ""Julia
continuum"" C of such a function, i.e. the closure in the Riemann sphere of a
component of the Julia set. We show that infinity is a terminal point of C, and
that C has span zero in the sense of Lelek; under a mild geometric assumption
on the function C is arc-like. (Whether every span zero continuum is also
arc-like was a famous question in continuum theory, only recently resolved in
the negative.) Conversely, we construct a single disjoint-type entire function
with the remarkable property that each arc-like continuum with at least one
terminal point is realised as a Julia continuum. The class of arc-like continua
with terminal points is uncountable. It includes, in particular, the
sin(1/x)-curve, the Knaster buckethandle and the pseudo-arc, so these can all
occur as Julia continua of a disjoint-type entire function.
  We give similar descriptions of the possible topology of Julia continua that
contain periodic points or points with bounded orbits, and answer a question of
Bara\'nski and Karpi\'nska by showing that Julia continua need not contain
points that are accessible from the Fatou set. Furthermore, we construct an
entire function whose Julia set has connected components on which the iterates
tend to infinity pointwise, but not uniformly. This is related to a famous
conjecture of Eremenko concerning escaping sets of entire functions.

concentration are experimentally investigated for evaporation of a sessile

temperature of the liquid-gas interface are measured using high-speed
visualization and infrared thermography, respectively. The motion of the
particles inside the evaporating droplet is qualitatively visualized by an
optical microscope and profile of final particle deposit is measured by an
optical profilometer. On a non-heated hydrophilic substrate, a ring-like
deposit forms after the evaporation, as reported extensively in the literature;
while on a heated hydrophilic substrate, a thinner ring with an inner deposit
is reported in the present work. The latter is attributed to Marangoni
convection and recorded motion of the particles as well as measured temperature
gradient across the liquid-gas interface confirms this hypothesis. The thinning
of the ring scales with the substrate temperature and is reasoned to stronger
Marangoni convection at larger substrate temperature. In case of a non-heated
hydrophobic substrate, an inner deposit forms due to very early depinning of
the contact line. On the other hand, in case of a heated hydrophobic substrate,
the substrate heating as well as larger particle concentration helps in the
pinning of the contact line, which results in a thin ring with an inner
deposit. We propose a regime map for predicting three types of deposits namely,
ring, thin ring with inner deposit and inner deposit - for varying substrate
temperature, substrate wettability and particles concentration. A first-order
model corroborates the liquid-gas interface temperature measurements and
variation in the measured ring profile with the substrate temperature.

controllers, to achieve high tracking precision can be time-consuming and
difficult, due to hidden dynamics and other non-idealities. The Deep Neural
Network (DNN), with its superior capability of approximating abstract,
nonlinear functions, proposes a novel approach for enhancing trajectory
tracking control. This paper presents a DNN-based algorithm as an add-on module
that improves the tracking performance of a classical feedback controller.
Given a desired trajectory, the DNNs provide a tailored reference input to the
controller based on their gained experience. The input aims to achieve a unity
map between the desired and the output trajectory. The motivation for this work
is an interactive ""fly-as-you-draw"" application, in which a user draws a
trajectory on a mobile device, and a quadrotor instantly flies that trajectory
with the DNN-enhanced control system. Experimental results demonstrate that the
proposed approach improves the tracking precision for user-drawn trajectories
after the DNNs are trained on selected periodic trajectories, suggesting the
method's potential in real-world applications. Tracking errors are reduced by
around 40-50% for both training and testing trajectories from users,
highlighting the DNNs' capability of generalizing knowledge.

discrepancy from the standard model in collider experiments thus far(apart from
the non zero neutrino masses). Here we analyze the phenomenological
implications for these decay modes in a Flipped/Lepton-Specific
two-Higg-doublet model with anomalously enhanced charged Higgs coupling to
$\tau$/b. We conclude that this extension of the standard model can give
results in agreement within 1$\sigma$ of the experimental values for the
combination of R($D^{(*)}$) and Br(B $\rightarrow \tau \nu_{\tau}$) data.

of transcription factors (TFs) with their specific binding sites on DNA. We
consider three possible mechanisms viz. monomer, hetero-oligomer and
coordinated recruitment pathways. In the monomer pathway, combinatorial TFs
search for their targets in an independent manner and the protein-protein
interactions among them will be insignificant. The protein-protein interactions
are very strong so that the hetero-oligomer complex of TFs as a whole searches
for the cognate sites in case of hetero-oligomer pathway. The TF which arrived
first will recruit the adjacent TFs in a sequential manner in the recruitment
pathway. The free energy released from the protein-protein interactions among
TFs will be in turn utilized to stabilize the TFs-DNA complex. Such coordinated
binding of TFs in fact emerges as the cooperative effect. Monomer and
hetero-oligomer pathways are efficient only when few TFs are involved in the
combinatorial regulation. Detailed random walk simulations suggest that when
the number of TFs in a combination increases then the searching efficiency of
TFs in these pathways decreases with the increasing number of TFs in a power
law manner. The power law exponent associated with the monomer pathway seems to
be strongly dependent on the number of TFs, distance between the initial
position of TFs from their specific binding sites and the hop size associated
with the dynamics of TFs on DNA.

Tomography requires the knowledge of the statistical turbulence parameters,

identification is performed thanks to the Learn & Apply (L&A) algorithm, that
consists in model- fitting the covariance matrix of WFS measurements dependent

introducing a constraint relaxation that is effective only when the original

arises from both the choice of the initial state and the choice of actions, and
the number of executions to be explored grows exponentially with their length.
We introduce a notion of $\varepsilon$-independence relation over actions that
relate approximately commutative actions; $\varepsilon$-equivalent action
sequences are obtained by swapping $\varepsilon$-independent consecutive action
pairs. Our reachability algorithm generalizes individual executions to cover
sets of executions that start from different, but $\delta$-close initial
states, and follow different, but $\varepsilon$-independent, action sequences.
The constructed over-approximations can be made arbitrarily precise by reducing
the $\delta,\varepsilon$ parameters. Exploiting both the continuity of actions

reduction in the number of executions explored. We illustrate this with
experiments on consensus, platooning, and distributed control examples.

polarized intensity displays a ring-like structure with a peak located on the
east side with a polarization fraction of $P= 3.26 \pm 0.02$ %, which is
different from the peak of the continuum emission from the northeast region.
The polarized intensity is significantly weaker at the peak of the continuum
where $P= 0.220 \pm 0.010$ %. The polarization vectors are in the radial
direction in the main ring of the polarized intensity, while there are two
regions outside at the northwest and northeast areas where the vectors are in
the azimuthal direction. If the polarization vectors represent the magnetic
field morphology, the polarization vectors indicate the toroidal magnetic field
configuration on the main ring and the poloidal fields outside. On the other
hand, the flip of the polarization vectors is predicted by the self-scattering
of thermal dust emission due to the change of the direction of thermal

on a finite dimensional planar graph using a pipe-flow analogy whereby mass
transfer occurs because of pressure differences with a conductivity coefficient
that varies with the flow intensity. We propose an extension of this model that
abandons the graph structure and moves to a continuous domain. Numerical
evidence, shows that the model is capable of describing the slime mold dynamics
also for large times, accurately reproducing the PP behavior.
  A notable result related to the original model is that it is equivalent to an
optimal transportation problem over the graph as time tends to infinity. In our
case, we can only conjecture that our extension presents a time-asymptotic
equilibrium. This equilibrium point is precisely the solution of the
Monge-Kantorovich (MK) equations at the basis of the PDE formulation of optimal
transportation problems. Numerical results obtained with our approach, which
combines P1 Finite Elements with forward Euler time stepping, show that the

challenge in the field is the realization of all electrical methods to control
the spin polarization and spin transistor operation at ambient temperature. For
this purpose, two-dimensional (2D) crystals offer a unique platform due to
their remarkable and contrasting spintronic properties, such as weak spin-orbit
coupling (SOC) in graphene and strong SOC in molybdenum disulfide (MoS$_2$).
Here we combine graphene and MoS$_2$ in a van der Waals heterostructure to
realize the electric control of the spin polarization and spin lifetime, and
demonstrated a spin field-effect transistor (spin-FET) at room temperature in a
non-local measurement geometry. We observe electrical gate control of the spin
valve signal due to pure spin transport and Hanle spin precession signals in
the graphene channel in proximity with MoS$_2$ at room temperature. We show
that this unprecedented control over the spin polarization and lifetime stems
from the gate-tuning of the Schottky barrier at the MoS$_2$/graphene interface
and MoS$_2$ channel conductivity leading to spin interaction with high SOC
material. The all-electrical creation, transport and control of the spin
polarization in a spin-FET device at room temperature is a substantial step in
the field of spintronics. It opens a new platform for the interplay of spin,

carried out with Suzaku twice, once on 2012 April 13 and then on 2012 October
24, with exposures of 180 ks and 217 ks, respectively. The source showed a hard
power-law shape spectrum with a mild cutoff at $\sim 8$ keV, which is typical
of ULXs when they are relatively dim. On both occasions, the 0.6-11 keV
spectrum was explained successfully in terms a cool ($\sim 0.2$ keV)
multi-color disk blackbody emission model and a thermal Comptonization emission
produced by an electron cloud with a relatively low temperature and high
optical depth, assuming that a large fraction of the disk-blackbody photons are
Comptonized whereas the rest is observed directly. The 0.5-10 keV luminosity
was $1.2\times10^{40}$ erg s$^{-1}$ in April, and $\sim 14\%$ higher in
October. This brightening was accompanied by spectral softening in $\ge 2$ keV,
with little changes in the $\le 2$ keV spectral shape. This behavior can be
understood if the accretion disk remains unchanged, while the electron cloud
covers a variable fraction of the disk. The absorbing column density was
consistent with the galactic line-of sight value, and did not vary by more than
$1.6\times 10^{21}$ cm$^{-2}$. Together with the featureless spectra, these
properties may not be reconciled easily with the super-critical accretion
scenario of this source.

steady state excitonic population under intermediate range of carrier

  Parties",,,,,"cs.CR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In traditional e-voting protocols, privacy is often provided by a trusted
authority that learns the votes and computes the tally. Some protocols replace
the trusted authority by a set of authorities, and privacy is guaranteed if
less than a threshold number of authorities are corrupt. For verifiability,
stronger security guarantees are demanded. Typically, corrupt authorities that
try to fake the result of the tally must always be detected.
  To provide verifiability, many e-voting protocols use Non-Interactive
Zero-Knowledge proofs (NIZKs). Thanks to their non-interactive nature, NIZKs
allow anybody, including third parties that do not participate in the protocol,
to verify the correctness of the tally. Therefore, NIZKs can be used to obtain
universal verifiability. Additionally, NIZKs also improve usability because
they allow voters to cast a vote using a non-interactive protocol.
  The disadvantage of NIZKs is that their security is based on setup
assumptions such as the common reference string (CRS) or the random oracle (RO)
model. The former requires a trusted party for the generation of a common
reference string. The latter, though a popular methodology for designing secure
protocols, has been shown to be unsound.
  In this paper, we address the design of an e-voting protocol that provides
verifiability without any trust assumptions, where verifiability here is meant
without eligibility verification. We show that Non-Interactive
Witness-Indistinguishable proofs (NIWI) can be used for this purpose. The
e-voting scheme is private under the Decision Linear assumption, while
verifiability holds unconditionally. To our knowledge, this is the first
private e-voting scheme with perfect universal verifiability, i.e. one in which
the probability of a fake tally not being detected is 0, and with {\em
non-interactive} protocols that does not rely on trust assumptions.

and two microscopic calculations, all describing 2$M_\odot$ neutron stars.
Unified EoSs for the inner-crust-core region have been built for all the

investigation shows the existence of a strong correlation of the neutron star
radii with the linear combination of the slopes of the nuclear matter
incompressibility and the symmetry energy coefficients at the saturation
density. Such correlations are found to be almost independent of the neutron
star mass in the range $0.6\text{-}1.8M_{\odot}$. This correlation can be
linked to the empirical relation existing between the star radius and the
pressure at a nucleonic density between one and two times saturation density,
and the dependence of the pressure on the nuclear matter incompressibility, its
slope and the symmetry energy slope. The slopes of the nuclear matter
incompressibility and the symmetry energy coefficients as estimated from the

advantages: first, coin verification involves only a constant number of states
(with respect to coin size), thereby allowing for smaller coins; second, the
re-usability of coins within our scheme grows linearly with the size of the

hole (BH) solutions in the presence of Born-Infeld (BI) electrodynamics. We
find that there are two different solutions for $z=n+1$ and $z\neq n+1$ cases
($z$ is dynamical critical exponent). We show that the thermodynamics first law
is satisfied for both cases. Then, we turn to study different phase transitions
(PTs) for our BHs. We start with study of Hawking-Page PT for both linearly and
BI charged BHs. After that, we discuss the PTs inside the BHs. We present the
improved Davies quantities and prove that the PT points shown by them coincide
with Ruppeiner ones. We show that the zero temperature PTs are transitions on
radiance properties of BHs by using Landau-Lifshitz theory. Next, we turn to
study Ruppeiner geometry of linearly and BI charged BHs. For linearly charged
case, we show that there are no PT at finite temperature for the case $z\geq
2$. For $z<2$, it is found that the number of finite temperature PT points
depends on the value of BH charge and is not more than two. When we have two
finite temperature PT points, there are no thermally stable BH between these
two points and we have discontinues small/large BH PTs. As expected, for small
BHs, we observe finite magnitude for Ruppeiner invariant which shows the finite
correlation between possible BH molecules while for large BHs, the correlation
is very small. Finally, we study the Ruppeiner geometry and thermal stability
of BI charged Lifshtiz BHs for different values of $z$. We observe that small
BHs are thermally unstable in some situations. Also, the behavior of
correlation between possible BH molecules for large BHs is the same as linearly
charged case. In both linearly and BI charged cases, for some choices of
parameters, the BH systems behave like a Van der Waals gas near transition
point.

parametrized by the splash function, which provides the velocity of the

Starting from elementary geometric considerations and physical principles, like
momentum conservation and energy dissipation in inelastic pair collisions, we
derive a rebound parametrization for the collision of a spherical grain with a
granular bed. Combined with a recently proposed energy-splitting model [Ho
${\it et\ al.}$, Phys. Rev. E 85, 052301 (2012)] that predicts how the impact
energy is distributed among the bed grains, this yields a coarse-grained but
complete characterization of the splash as a function of the impact velocity
and the impactor-bed grain-size ratio. The predicted mean values of the rebound
angle, total and vertical restitution, ejection speed, and number of ejected
grains are in excellent agreement with experimental literature data and with
our own discrete-element computer simulations. We extract a set of analytical
asymptotic relations for shallow impact geometries, which can readily be used
in coarse-grained analytical modeling or computer simulations of geophysical
particle-laden flows.

generated by a generator matrix. Due to this, the generator matrix approach is
called a fundamental construction of linear codes. This is the only known
construction method that can produce all linear codes over finite fields.
Recently, a defining-set construction of linear codes over finite fields has
attracted a lot of attention, and have been employed to produce a huge number
of classes of linear codes over finite fields. It was claimed that this
approach can also generate all linear codes over finite fields. But so far, no
proof of this claim is given in the literature. The objective of this paper is
to prove this claim, and confirm that the defining-set approach is indeed a
fundamental approach to constructing all linear codes over finite fields. As a

torque equilibrium spin-wave expansion approach, which can describe the spin
Casimir and magnon decay effects in a unified framework. While the framework
does not lose the generality, our discussion will be restricted to two
representative types of inter-chain coupling systems: $J_{3}$- or
$J_{4}$-system respectively. In spite of the long-range spiral order, the
dynamical properties of these systems turn out to be highly nontrivial due to
the incommensurate noncollinear spin configuration and the strong quantum
fluctuation effects enhanced by the frustration and low-dimensionality. Both
the systems show prominent spin Casimir effects induced by the vacuum
fluctuation of the spin waves and related modification of the ordering vector,
Lifshitz point's position and sublattice magnetization. Significant and
spontaneous magnon decay effects are manifested in the quantum corrections to
the excitation spectrum. By adjusting the strength of magnetic anisotropy and
varying the approximation scheme, it is revealed that these striking distinct
features are quite robust and have deep connection with both the spin Casimir
and the magnon decay effects. Thus these special consequences of the
inter-chain coupling on the spin wave dynamics may be served as a set of probes
for different types of inter-chain couplings in experiments. At last, to guide
experimental measurements such as inelastic neutron scattering in realistic
materials and complement our theoretical framework, we develop the analytical
theory of the dynamical structure factor within the torque equilibrium
formulism and provide the explicit results of the quasi-one dimensional

investigated around junction points, where successful results indicate the
perfect match of the trained model to the profiles of blood vessels in retinal

(partially oxidized, stacked sheets of graphene) have shown great potential in
water desalination and purification, gas and ion separation, biosensors, proton
conductors, lithium-based batteries and super-capacitors. Unlike carbon
nanotube (CNT) membranes, in which the nanotube pores have fixed sizes, the
pores of GO membranes - the interlayer spacing between GO sheets - are of
variable size. This presents a challenge for using GO membranes for filtration.
Despite the great efforts to tune and fix the interlayer spacing, it remains
difficult both to reduce the interlayer spacing sufficiently to exclude small
ions while keeping this separation constant against the tendency of GO
membranes to swell when immersed in aqueous solution, which greatly affects the
applications of GO membranes. Here, we demonstrate experimentally that highly
efficient and selective ion rejection by GO membranes can be readily achieved
by controlling the interlayer spacing of GO membranes using cations (K+, Na+,
Ca2+, Li+ and Mg2+) themselves. The interspacing can be controlled with
precision as small as 1 A, and GO membranes controlled by one kind of cation
can exclude other cations with a larger hydrated volume, which can only be
accommodated with a larger interlayer spacing. First-principles calculations
reveal that the strong noncovalent cation-pi interactions between hydrated
cations in solution and aromatic ring structures in GO are the cause of this
unexpected behavior. These findings open up new avenues for using GO membranes

super-capacitors, molecular sieves for separating ions or molecules, and many

prediction and completion. These extensions incorporate a structured knowledge
base and numerical values from the text into the context used to predict the
next word. Our automated evaluation on a clinical dataset shows extended models
significantly outperform standard models. Our best system uses both
conditioning and grounding, because of their orthogonal benefits. For word
prediction with a list of 5 suggestions, it improves recall from 25.03% to
71.28% and for word completion it improves keystroke savings from 34.35% to
44.81%, where theoretical bound for this dataset is 58.78%. We also perform a
qualitative investigation of how models with lower perplexity occasionally fare
better at the tasks. We found that at test time numbers have more influence on

challenging, which often render model-based system verification techniques like
model checking infeasible. To overcome this challenge, we propose a method
called LAR to automatically `verify' such complex systems through a combination
of learning, abstraction and refinement from a set of system log traces. We
assume that log traces and sampling frequency are adequate to capture `enough'
behaviour of the system. Given a safety property and the concrete system log
traces as input, LAR automatically learns and refines system models, and
produces two kinds of outputs. One is a counterexample with a bounded
probability of being spurious. The other is a probabilistic model based on
which the given property is `verified'. The model can be viewed as a proof
obligation, i.e., the property is verified if the model is correct. It can also
be used for subsequent system analysis activities like runtime monitoring or
model-based testing. Our method has been implemented as a self-contained
software toolkit. The evaluation on multiple benchmark systems as well as a
real-world water treatment system shows promising results.

more evidence for the presence of porous grains is found. We aim at quantifying
the systematic errors introduced when modelling debris discs composed of porous
dust with a disc model assuming spherical, compact grains. We calculate the
optical dust properties derived via the fast, but simple effective medium
theory. The theoretical lower boundary of the size distribution -- the
so-called 'blowout size' -- is compared in the cases of compact and porous
grains. Finally, we simulate observations of hypothetical debris discs with
different porosities and feed them into a fitting procedure using only compact
grains. The deviations of the results for compact grains from the original
model based on porous grains are analysed. We find that the blowout size
increases with increasing grain porosity up to a factor of two. An analytical
approximation function for the blowout size as a function of porosity and
stellar luminosity is derived. The analysis of the geometrical disc set-up,
when constrained by radial profiles, are barely affected by the porosity.
However, the determined minimum grain size and the slope of the grain size
distribution derived using compact grains are significantly overestimated.
Thus, the unexpectedly high ratio of minimum grain size to blowout size found
by previous studies using compact grains can be partially described by dust
grain porosity, although the effect is not strong enough to completely explain
the trend.

use of three sets of observations: (a) X-ray observations of neutron stars

X-ray and UV observations of MSPs. As shown in previous works, r-mode
dissipation by shear viscosity is not sufficient to explain observational set
(a), and enhanced r-mode dissipation at the red-shifted internal temperatures
$T^\infty\sim 10^8$ K is required to stabilize the observed NSs. Here, we argue
that models with enhanced bulk viscosity can hardly lead to a self-consistent
explanation of observational set (a) due to strong neutrino emission, which is
typical for these models (unrealistically powerful energy source is required to
keep NSs at the observed temperatures). We also demonstrate that the
observational set (b), combined with the theory of internal heating and NS
cooling, provides evidence of enhanced r-mode dissipation at low temperatures,
$T^\infty\sim 2\times 10^7$ K. Observational set (c) allows us to set an upper
limit on the internal temperatures of MSPs, $T^\infty<2\times 10^7$ K (assuming
a canonical NS with the accreted crust). Recycling scenario can produce MSPs at
these temperatures only if r-mode instability is suppressed in the whole MSP
spin frequency range ($\nu\lesssim 750$ Hz) at temperatures $2\times
10^7\lesssim T^\infty\lesssim 3 \times 10^7$ K, providing thus a new constraint

Conducting SrRuO3 (SRO) epitaxial thin films have been extensively used as
electrodes in complex-oxide heterostructures due to good lattice mismatches
with perovskite substrates. However, when compared to SRO single crystals, SRO
thin films have shown reduced conductivity and Curie temperatures (T_C), which
can lead to higher Joule heating and energy loss in the devices. Here, we
report that high-quality SRO thin films can be synthesized by controlling the
plume dynamics and growth rate of pulsed laser epitaxy (PLE) with real-time
optical spectroscopic monitoring. The SRO thin films grown under the
kinetically controlled conditions, down to ca. 16 nm in thickness, exhibit both
enhanced conductivity and T_C as compared to bulk values, due to their improved
stoichiometry and a strain-mediated increase of the bandwidth of Ru 4d
electrons. This result provides a direction for enhancing the physical
properties of PLE-grown thin films and paves a way for improved device
applications.

ice, Cherenkov light is the dominant light producing mechanism when the
particle's velocity exceeds the Cherenkov threshold, approximately three
quarters of the speed of light in vacuum. Luminescence is produced by highly
ionizing particles passing through matter due to the electronic excitation of
the surrounding molecules. The observables of luminescence, such as the
wavelength spectrum and decay times, are highly dependent on the properties of
the medium, in particular, temperature and purity. The results for the light
yield of luminescence of previous measurements vary by two orders of magnitude.
It will be shown that even for the lowest measured light yield, luminescence is
an important signature of highly ionizing particles below the Cherenkov
threshold. These could be magnetic monopoles or other massive and highly
ionizing exotic particles. With the highest observed efficiencies, luminescence
may even contribute significantly to the light output of standard model
particles such as the PeV IceCube neutrinos. We present analysis techniques to
use luminescence in neutrino telescopes and discuss experimental setups to
measure the light yield of luminescence for the particular conditions in

resources. Whereas in non-rigid paradigms (e.g., standard Taylor expansion or
non-idempotent intersection types), bags of resources are multisets and
invariant under permutation, in the rigid ones, permutations must be processed
explicitly and can be allowed or disallowed. Rigidity enables a fine-grained
control of reduction paths and their effects on e.g., typing derivations. We
previously introduced a very constrained coinductive type system (system S) in
which permutation is completely disallowed. One may wonder in what extent the
absence of permutations causes a loss of expressivity w.r.t. reduction paths,
compared to a usual multiset framework or a rigid one allowing permutations. We
answer this question in the most general case i.e. coinductive type grammars
without validity conditions. Our main contribution is to prove that not only
every non-idempotent derivation can be represented by a rigid, permutation-free
derivation, but also that any dynamic behavior may be captured in this way. In
other words, we prove that system S has full expressive power over
multiset/permutation-inclusive intersection.

remaining sufficiently simple to facilitate physical insight into iceberg drift

understanding and also enables the rapid computation of large numbers of
iceberg trajectories. The long-standing empirical rule of thumb that icebergs
drift at 2% of the wind velocity, relative to the ocean current, is derived
here from physical first principles, and it is shown that this relation only
holds in the limit of strong winds or small icebergs, which approximately
applies for typical icebergs in the Arctic. It is demonstrated that the
opposite limit of weak winds or large icebergs approximately applies for
typical Antarctic tabular icebergs, and that in this case the icebergs simply
move with the ocean surface current. It is furthermore found that when winds
are strong, wind drag drives icebergs in the direction the wind blows, whereas
weak winds drive icebergs at a 90 degree angle to the wind direction.

changes in the radius at which the accreting matter, forming an accretion disk,
is captured by the magnetosphere of the white dwarf (WD). Assuming that this
radius scales as the power of -2/7 of the mass accretion rate, and utilizing
the two temperature measurements, as well as the standard mass-radius relation
of WDs, we determined the WD mass in GK Persei as 0.90 +/- 0.06 solar masses.
The magnetic field is estimated as 4*10^5 G.

regularized optimal plans depending on whether the domain of the regularizer
lies within the non-negative orthant or not. These schemes are based on
Dykstra's algorithm with alternate Bregman projections, and further exploit the
Newton-Raphson method when applied to separable divergences. We enhance the

and whose edge set contains straight-line segments. A matching in a graph is a
subset of edges of the graph with no shared vertices. A matching is called
perfect if it matches all the vertices of the underling graph. A geometric
matching is a matching in a geometric graph. In this thesis, we study matching
problems in various geometric graphs. Among the family of geometric graphs we
look at complete graphs, complete bipartite graphs, complete multipartite
graphs, Delaunay graphs, Gabriel graphs, and $\Theta$-graphs. The classical
matching problem is to find a matching of maximum size in a given graph. We
study this problem as well as some of its variants on geometric graphs. The
bottleneck matching problem is to find a maximum matching that minimizes the
length of the longest edge. The plane matching problem is to find a maximum
matching so that the edges in the matching are pairwise non-crossing. A
geometric matching is strong with respect to a given shape $S$ if we can assign
to each edge in the matching a scaled version of $S$ such that the shapes
representing the edges are pairwise disjoint. The strong matching problem is to
find a maximum strong matching with respect to a given shape. The matching
packing problem is to pack as many edge-disjoint perfect matchings as possible
into a geometric graph. We study these problems and establish lower and upper
bounds on the size of different kinds of matchings in various geometric graphs.
We also present algorithms for computing such matchings. Some of the presented
bounds are tight, while the others need to be sharpened.

for fiber-optic transmission as the input power tends to infinity. With $n$
signal DOFs at the input, $n-1$ DOFs are asymptotically lost to signal-noise
interactions. The main observation is that, nonlinearity introduces a
multiplicative noise in the channel, similar to fading in wireless channels.
The channel is viewed in the spherical coordinate system, where signal vector
$\underline{X}\in\mathbb{C}^n$ is represented in terms of its norm
$|\underline{X}|$ and direction $\underline{\hat{X}}$. The multiplicative noise
causes signal direction $\underline{\hat{X}}$ to vary randomly on the surface
of the unit $(2n-1)$-sphere in $\mathbb{C}^{n}$, in such a way that the
effective area of the support of $\underline{\hat{X}}$ does not vanish as
$|\underline{X}|\rightarrow\infty$. On the other hand, the surface area of the
sphere is finite, so that $\underline{\hat{X}}$ carries finite information.
This observation is used to show several results. Firstly, let $\mathcal
C(\mathcal P)$ be the capacity of a discrete-time periodic model of the optical
fiber with distributed noise and frequency-dependent loss, as a function of the
average input power $\mathcal P$. It is shown that asymptotically as $\mathcal
P\rightarrow\infty$, $\mathcal C=\frac{1}{n}\log\bigl(\log\mathcal P\bigr)+c$,
where $n$ is the dimension of the input signal space and $c$ is a bounded
number. In particular, $\lim_{\mathcal P\rightarrow\infty}\mathcal C(\mathcal
P)=\infty$ in finite-dimensional periodic models. Secondly, it is shown that
capacity saturates to a constant in infinite-dimensional models where
$n=\infty$.

developed a model that simulates dust coagulation, dust dynamics (settling,
turbulent mixing), vapor diffusion, and condensation/sublimation of volatiles
onto grains in a vertical column of a protoplanetary disk. We employ the model
to study how dust growth and dynamics influence the vertical distribution of
water vapor and water ice in the region just outside the radial snowline. Our
main finding is that coagulation (boosted by the enhanced stickiness of icy
grains) and the ensuing vertical settling of solids results in water vapor
being depleted, but not totally removed, from the region above the snowline on
a timescale commensurate with the vertical turbulent mixing timescale.
Depending on the strength of the turbulence and the temperature, the depletion
can reach factors of up to ${\sim}50$ in the disk atmosphere. In our isothermal
column, this vapor depletion results in the vertical snowline moving closer to
the midplane (by up to 2 gas scale heights) and the gas-phase C/O ratio above
the vertical snowline increasing. Our findings illustrate the importance of

output of multiple channels that are all excited with the same unknown input.
From these observations, we wish to estimate the impulse responses of each of
the channels. We show that this problem is well-posed if the channels follow a
bilinear model where the ensemble of channel responses is modeled as lying in a
low-dimensional subspace but with each channel modulated by an independent
gain. Under this model, we show how the channel estimates can be found by
minimizing a quadratic functional over a non-convex set.
  We analyze two methods for solving this non-convex program, and provide
performance guarantees for each. The first is a method of alternating
eigenvectors that breaks the program down into a series of eigenvalue problems.
The second is a truncated power iteration, which can roughly be interpreted as
a method for finding the largest eigenvector of a symmetric matrix with the
additional constraint that it adheres to our bilinear model. As with most
non-convex optimization algorithms, the performance of both of these algorithms
is highly dependent on having a good starting point. We show how such a
starting point can be constructed from the channel measurements.
  Our performance guarantees are non-asymptotic, and provide a sufficient
condition on the number of samples observed per channel in order to guarantee
channel estimates of a certain accuracy. Our analysis uses a model with a
""generic"" subspace that is drawn at random, and we show the performance bounds
hold with high probability. Mathematically, the key estimates are derived by
quantifying how well the eigenvectors of certain random matrices approximate
the eigenvectors of their mean.

controversial. We performed a systemic review with the aim to have a better
understanding of DS's prevalence in general population. The results showed the
prevalence of DS is very gender specific and age specific. Both women and men
have few DS before 50 years old, after 50 years old both women and men start to
develop DS, with women having a faster developing rate than men. For elderly
Chinese (>=65 yrs, mean age: 72.5 yrs), large population based studies
(MsOS(Hong Kong) and MrOS (Hong Kong), females n=2000 and males n=2000) showed
DS prevalence was for 25.0% for women and 19.1% for men, and the prevalence F:M
(women:men) ratio was 1.3:1. The published data (MsOS(USA) and MrOS(USA)
studies) seem to show elderly Caucasian American has a higher DS prevalence,
being approximately 60-70% higher than elderly Chinese; however the prevalence
F:M ratio was similar to elderly Chinese population. Patient data showed female
patients more often received treatment than men; and preliminary data show the
ratio of numbers of female patients received treatment compared with men did
not differ between Northeast Asians (Chinese, Japanese, and Korean) and
European and American Caucasians, being around 2:1 in elderly population. The
existing data also suggest that menopause may be a contributing factor for the

suitable boundary condition for the strain, namely requesting the non-vanishing
of its boundary integral, results in a confinement effect. More precisely, in
the presence of an external strain with circulation equal to n times the
lattice spacing, it is energetically convenient to have n distinct dislocations

the core radius approach and by studying the asymptotics as the core size

  cases in Mainland China","Total 16 pages, 3 figures",,,,"q-bio.TO","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Purpose: Rupture of an intracranial aneurysm is the most common cause of
subarachnoid haemorrhage (SAH), which is a life-threatening acute
cerebrovascular event that typically affects working-age people. This study
aims to investigate the aneurysmal SAH incidence rate in elderly population
than in middle aged population in China. Materials and methods: Aneurysmal SAH
cases were collected retrospectively from the archives of 21 hospitals in
Mainland China. All the cases collected were from September 2016 and backward
consecutively for a period of time up to 8 years. SAH was initially diagnosed
by brain computed tomography, and CT angiography (CTA) or digital subtraction
angiography (DSA) was followed and SAH was confirmed to be due to cerebral
aneurysm. When for cases multiple bleeding occurred, the age of the first SAH
was used in this study. The toltal incidence from all hospital at each age were
summed together for females and males; then adjusted by the total population
number at each age for females and males. The total population data was from
the 2010 population census of the People's Republic of China. Results: In total
there were 8,144 cases, with 4,861 females and 3,283 males. Our analysis shows
for both females and males the relative aneurysmal SAH rate started to decrease
after around 65 years old. The males the relative aneurysmal SAH rate might
have started to decrease after around 55 years old. Conclusion: In contrast to
previous reports, our data demonstrated a decreased aneurysmal subarachnoid
hemorrhage incidence rate in elderly population than in middle aged population.
Our data therefore support the hypothesis that aneurysms do not grow
progressively once they form but probably either rupture or stabilize and that
very elderly patients are at a reduced risk of rupture compared with atients
who are younger with the same-sized aneurysms.

globally. Large telemetry and tracking data sets have been collected for this

methods for inferring behaviours in central place foraging trips. In this paper
we describe an approach based on hidden Markov models, which splits foraging
trips into segments labelled as ""outbound"", ""search"", ""forage"", and ""inbound"".
By structuring the hidden Markov model transition matrix appropriately, the
model naturally handles the sequence of behaviours within a foraging trip.
Additionally, by structuring the model in this way, we are able to develop
realistic simulations from the fitted model. We demonstrate our approach on
data from southern elephant seals (Mirounga leonina) tagged on Kerguelen Island
in the Southern Ocean. We discuss the differences between our 4-state model and
the widely used 2-state model, and the advantages and disadvantages of
employing a more complex model.

investigated starting from the first principles of quantum electrodynamics in

polarization tensor defined over the entire plane of complex frequency is used.
At zero temperature we reproduce the results for both real and imaginary parts
of the conductivity, obtained previously in the local approximation, and
generalize them taking into account the effects of nonlocality. At nonzero
temperature the exact analytic expressions for real and imaginary parts of the
longitudinal and transverse conductivities of gapped graphene are derived, as
well as their local limits and approximate expressions in several asymptotic
regimes. Specifically, a simple local result for the real part of conductivity
of gapped graphene valid at any temperature is obtained. According to our
results, the real part of the conductivity is not equal to zero for frequencies
exceeding the width of the gap and goes to the universal conductivity with
increasing frequency. The imaginary part of conductivity of gapped graphene
varies from infinity at zero frequency to minus infinity at the frequency
defined by the gap parameter and then goes to zero with further increase of
frequency. The analytic expressions are accompanied by the results of numerical
computations. Possible future generalization of the used formalism is
discussed.

observations. Three distinct radial depressions in the polarized intensity
distribution are seen, around 85, 21, and 6~au. The overall intensity
distribution has a high degree of azimuthal symmetry; the disk is somewhat
brighter than average towards the South and darker towards the North-West. The
ADI observations yielded no signifiant detection of point sources in the disk.
  Our observations have a linear spatial resolution of 1 to 2au, similar to
that of recent ALMA dust continuum observations. The sub-micron sized dust
grains that dominate the light scattering in the disk surface are strongly
coupled to the gas. We created a radiative transfer disk model with
self-consistent temperature and vertical structure iteration and including
grain size-dependent dust settling. This method may provide independent
constraints on the gas distribution at higher spatial resolution than is
feasible with ALMA gas line observations.
  We find that the gas surface density in the ""gaps"" is reduced by 50% to 80%
relative to an unperturbed model. Should embedded planets be responsible for
carving the gaps then their masses are at most a few 10 Mearth. The observed
gaps are wider, with shallower flanks, than expected for planet-disk
interaction with such low-mass planets. If forming planetary bodies have
undergone collapse and are in the ""detachted phase"" then they may be directly
observable with future facilities such as METIS at the E-ELT.
