form a complex network in which drops of wetting liquid tend to accumulate at
the nodes. The capillary force exerted by the liquid can bend flexible fibers,
which in turn influences the morphology adopted by the liquid. In this paper,
we investigate, the role of the fiber flexibility on the shape of a small
volume of liquid on a pair of crossed flexible fibers, through a model
situation. We characterize the liquid morphologies as we vary the volume of
liquid, the angle between the fibers, and the length of the fibers. The drop
morphologies previously reported for rigid crossed fibers, i.e., a drop, a
column and a mixed morphology, are also observed on flexible crossed fibers
with modified domains of existence. In addition, at small tilting angles
between the fibers, a new behavior is observed: the fibers bend and collapse.
Depending on the volume of liquid, a thin column with or without a drop is
reported on the collapsed fibers. Our study suggests that the fiber flexibility
adds a rich variety of behaviors that may be important for some applications.

sensitive to the sound speed perturbation in the ocean acoustic waveguides.
Such a component is formed by a narrow beam of rays whose spread in vertical
direction, up to the observation range, remains less than the vertical scale of
perturbation. These rays pass through practically the same inhomogeneities and
therefore their phases acquire close increments. If the ray amplitudes vary
insignificantly, then (i) the stable component of the monochromatic field in
the perturbed and unperturbed waveguide differ by only a constant phase factor,
and (ii) in the case of transient wave field the perturbation causes only an
additional time delay of the stable component as a whole. It is shown how the
stable components can be selected from the total wave field using the field
expansions in coherent states or in normal modes. The existence of stable
components is demonstrated by numerical simulation of sound field in a deep

elements within SOFA. The refinement strategy relies upon a hexahedron-based
finite element method, combined with a posteriori error estimation driven local
$h$-refinement, for simulating soft tissue deformation. Results: We control the
local and global error level in the mechanical fields (e.g. displacement or
stresses) during the simulation. We show the convergence of the algorithm on
academic examples, and demonstrate its practical usability on a percutaneous
procedure involving needle insertion in a liver. For the latter case, we
compare the force displacement curves obtained from the proposed adaptive

Error control guarantees that a tolerable error level is not exceeded during

Our work provides a first step to discriminate between discretization error and

descriptor that can be used for modelling thermodynamic properties of organic
chemical compounds. Motivated by its applicable potential, a series of
investigations have been carried out in the past several years. In this note we
first consider graphs with given edge-connectivity that attain the maximum ABC
index. In particular, we give an affirmative answer to the conjecture about the
structure of graphs with edge-connectivity equal to one that maximize the ABC
index, which was recently raised by Zhang, Yang, Wang and Zhang~\cite{zywz
mabciggp-2016}. In addition, we provide supporting evidence for another
conjecture posed by the same authors which concerns graphs that maximize the
ABC index among all graphs with chromatic number equal to some fixed $\chi \geq
3$. Specifically, we confirm this conjecture in the case where the order of the
graph is divisible by $\chi$.

collaborate, communicate, refer patients to each other. Most healthcare service
network models have been constructed from patient claims data, using billing
claims to link patients with providers. The data sets can be quite large,
making standard methods for network construction computationally challenging
and thus requiring the use of alternate construction algorithms. While these
alternate methods have seen increasing use in generating healthcare networks,
there is little to no literature comparing the differences in the structural
properties of the generated networks. To address this issue, we compared the
properties of healthcare networks constructed using different algorithms and
the 2013 Medicare Part B outpatient claims data. Three different algorithms
were compared: binning, sliding frame, and trace-route. Unipartite networks
linking either providers or healthcare organizations by shared patients were
built using each method. We found that each algorithm produced networks with
substantially different topological properties. Provider networks adhered to a
power law, and organization networks to a power law with exponential cutoff.
Censoring networks to exclude edges with less than 11 shared patients, a common
de-identification practice for healthcare network data, markedly reduced edge
numbers and greatly altered measures of vertex prominence such as the
betweenness centrality. We identified patterns in the distance patients travel
between network providers, and most strikingly between providers in the
Northeast United States and Florida. We conclude that the choice of network
construction algorithm is critical for healthcare network analysis, and discuss
the implications for selecting the algorithm best suited to the type of
analysis to be performed.

and light in comparison with their relativistic counterparts: they are easily
recoiled, reflected, and also diffracted form optical gratings and
nanostructures. As a consequence, they can be also better manipulated into the
desired shape. For example, they get bunched quite fast in interaction with
acceleration gratings in presence of an external electromagnetic radiation, a
phenomenon which can be desirable in development of superradiant coherent light
sources. Here, I examine the spatiotemporal behavior of pulsed electron wave
packets at low energies interacting with pulsed light and optical gratings,
using a quantum-mechanical self-consistent numerical toolbox which is
introduced here. It will be shown that electron pulses are accelerated very
fast in interaction with the near-field of the grating, demanding that a
synchronicity condition is met. To prevent the electrons to be transversely
deflected from the grating a symmetric double-grating configuration is
necessary. It is found that even in this configuration, diffraction due to the
interaction of the electron with the standing-wave light inside the gap between
the gratings, is a source of defocusing. Moreover, the longitudinal broadening
of the electron pulse directly affects the final shape of the electron wave
packet due to the occurrence of multiple electron-photon scatterings. These
investigations pave the way towards the design of more efficient
electron-driven photon sources and accelerators.

fundamental limits of this model are characterized under various asymptotic

and the analysis is significantly different from that traditionally used in

It is also shown that message passing is not always helpful but dependent on
individual samples. Gated functions are therefore needed to control message
transmission, whose on-or-offs are controlled by extra visual evidence from the
input sample. The effectiveness of GBD-Net is shown through experiments on
three object detection datasets, ImageNet, Pascal VOC2007 and Microsoft COCO.

determined. The genetic code carries instructions on how to control these
properties in order to regulate the pattern and morphology of structures in the
developing organism. Transcription and protein translation mechanisms implement
these instructions. However, this cannot happen without some manner of sampling
of epigenetic information on the current patterns and morphological forms of
structures in the organism. Any rigorous description of space- and time-varying
patterns and morphological forms reduces to one among various classes of
spatio-temporal partial differential equations. Reaction-transport equations
represent one such class. Starting from simple Fickian diffusion, the
incorporation of reaction, phase segregation and advection terms can represent
many of the patterns seen in the animal and plant kingdoms. Morphological form,
requiring the development of three-dimensional structure, also can be
represented by these equations of mass transport, albeit to a limited degree.
The recognition that physical forces play controlling roles in shaping tissues
leads to the conclusion that (nonlinear) elasticity governs the development of
morphological form. In this setting, inhomogeneous growth drives the elasticity
problem. The combination of reaction-transport equations with those of
elasto-growth makes accessible a potentially unlimited spectrum of patterning
and morphogenetic phenomena in developmental biology. This perspective
communication is a survey of the partial differential equations of mathematical
physics that have been proposed to govern patterning and morphogenesis in
developmental biology. Several numerical examples are included to illustrate
these equations and the corresponding physics, with the intention of providing

physical properties and magnetic characteristics of the multiple system HD
164492C, located in the young open cluster M20. The spectrum reveals evidence
of 3 components: a broad-lined early B star (HD 164492C1), a narrow-lined early
B star (HD 164492C2), and a late B star (HD 164492C3). Components C2 and C3
exhibit significant ($>100$ km/s) bulk radial velocity variations with a period
of $12.5351(7)$ d that we attribute to eccentric binary motion around a common
centre-of-mass. Component C1 exhibits no detectable radial velocity variations.
Using constraints derived from modeling the orbit of the C2+C3 binary and from
synthesis of the combined spectrum, we determine the approximate physical
characteristics of the components. We conclude that a coherent evolutionary
solution consistent with the published age of M20 implies a distance to the
system of $0.9\pm 0.2$ kpc, corresponding to the smallest published values. We
confirm the detection of a strong magnetic field in the combined spectrum. The
field is clearly associated with the broad-lined C1 component of the system.
Repeated measurement of the longitudinal magnetic field allows the derivation
of the rotation period of the magnetic star, $P_{\rm rot}=1.36986(6)$ d. We
derive the star's magnetic geometry, finding $i=63\pm 6$ deg, $\beta=33\pm 6$
deg and a dipole polar strength $B_{\rm d}=7.9^{+1.2}_{-1.0}$ kG. Strong
emission - varying according to the magnetic period - is detected in the
H$\alpha$ profile. This is consistent with the presence of a centrifugal
magnetosphere surrounding the rapidly rotating magnetic C1 component.

percolation. In contrast to the standard case $(<p_c)$, the distance $T(0,x)$
in the critical case grows sub linearly in $x$ and geodesics are expected to
have Euclidean length which is superlinear. We show a strong version of this
super linearity, namely that there is $s>1$ such that with probability at least
$1-e^{-\|x\|_1^c}$, the minimal length geodesic from $0$ to $x$ has at least
$\|x\|_1^s$ number of edges. Our proofs combine recent ideas to bound $T$ for
general critical distributions, and modifications of techniques of
Aizenman-Burchard to estimate the Hausdorff dimension of random curves.

dust typically causes flux-weighted measurements of stellar velocity dispersion
to be elevated with respect to mass-weighted measurements because dust
preferentially obscures young stars, which tend to be dynamically cooler than
older stellar populations in such systems. In exceptional situations, in which
young stars are not preferentially obscured by dust, flux-weighted velocity
dispersion measurements tend to be negatively offset with respect to
mass-weighted measurements because the dynamically cool young stellar

introducing logarithmic singularities. Since the nonlinearity is also of higher

methods have shown promising results, their application to problems with large
state dimensionality, such as in the case of humanoid robots, is still limited.
Additionally, by using these methods and during the interaction with the human

spatial constraints (e.g., from social rules). In this paper, we present Policy
Improvement with Spatio-Temporal Affordance Maps -- $\pi$-STAM, a novel

Our goal consists in generating a policy that adapts to the unknown action
semantics by using affordances. In this way, while learning to perform a
human-robot handover task, we can (1) efficiently generate good policies with
few training episodes, and (2) easily encode action semantics and, if
available, enforce prior knowledge in it. We experimentally validate our

taking an object from the hands of a human. The obtained results show that our

thermodynamic equilibrium as a function of their constituent parts. Yet most
systems in nature are not at equilibrium, and a unified theory of their
behavior does not currently exist. Here, I show that the Boltzmann distribution
is a special case of a general distribution that governs all stochastic
systems, even if far from equilibrium. The generalized Boltzmann distribution
is explained as an analog of the voltage equation in electronics, where
resistors, batteries, node voltages, and path currents correspond to
equilibrium rate constants, driven rate constants, probabilities, and
probability flows, respectively. The general distribution recapitulates known
properties of weakly driven systems and enables new closed-form solutions for
strongly-driven systems. These solutions provide insight into fundamental
limits on system performance, and experimental data show that living systems
can operate at those limits. The formal mapping between non-equilibrium systems
and electronic circuits may provide a unified framework to simplify,
understand, and ultimately control the behavior of complex non-equilibrium
systems.

to allow a non-convex decision set. This class of problems can be solved by
Lyapunov optimization. A simple drift-based algorithm, related to a classical
dual subgradient algorithm, converges to an $\epsilon$-optimal solution within

  The classic solution to this problem is based on finding common factors

fact that it is not sufficiently stable in the noisy setting. In this work,
inspired by the success of convex programming in provably and stably solving
various quadratic constrained problems, we develop a semidefinite

spin-orbit misalignments (stellar obliquities). Whether such properties are
primordial, or arise from post-formation dynamical interactions remains
uncertain. This paper considers the scenario in which the binary is the inner
component of a hierarchical triple stellar system, and derives the requirements
that the tertiary companion must satisfy in order to raise the eccentricity and
obliquity of the inner binary. Through numerical integrations of the secular
octupole-order equations of motion of stellar triples, coupled with the spin
precession of the oblate primary star due to the torque from the secondary, we
obtain a simple, robust condition for producing spin-orbit misalignment in the
inner binary: In order to excite appreciable obliquity, the precession rate of
the stellar spin axis must be smaller than the orbital precession rate due to
the tertiary companion. This yields quantitative requirements on the mass and
orbit of the tertiary. We also present new analytic expressions for the maximum
eccentricity and range of inclinations allowing eccentricity excitation
(Lidov-Kozai window), for stellar triples with arbitrary masses and including
the non-Keplerian potentials introduced by general relativity, stellar tides
and rotational bulges. The results of this paper can be used to place
constraints on unobserved tertiary companions in binaries that exhibit high
eccentricity and/or spin-orbit misalignment, and will be helpful in guiding
efforts to detect external companions around stellar binaries. As an
application, we consider the eclipsing binary DI Herculis, and identify the
requirements that a tertiary companion must satisfy to produce the observed
spin-orbit misalignment.

deg was studied using Large Eddy Simulation (LES) and Dynamic Mode
Decomposition (DMD). The Reynolds number (Re) based on the cylinder diameter of
the body is 22000. The results show that vortex oscillations exist over the
forebody at the whole range of AOAs. The oscillation is characterized by
alternate oscillations of a forebody leeward vortex pair up and down and
in-phase swings from side to side. The vortex shedding can be found at the
afterbody as AOAs more than 20o, and the shedding region moves forwards
gradually with AOAs increasing, and accordingly the region of vortex
oscillations contracts and eventually only exists near the nose as AOAs
sufficiently high. The vortex oscillation and shedding all induce fluctuating
side forces along the body, but the ones from vortex oscillations are larger.
The frequencies of vortex oscillations are similar to the ones of vortex
shedding at the AOAs of 10o-40o with St=0.085-0.12, in which the flow fields
over the afterbody are dominated by vortex shedding and forebody-vortex wakes
together; while at AOAs of 50o-80o, the frequencies along the body are
apparently divided into two regimes in which the vortex oscillations over the
forebody have the frequencies of 0.053-0.064, and the vortex shedding over the
afterbody has the frequencies of 0.16-0.2. The DMD analysis shows that except
the mean flows, the most energetic modes correspond to the vortex oscillation
at the forebody and to the vortex shedding at the afterbody respectively, and
the frequencies from DMD are identical to the ones of the side forces obtained
by fast Fourier transform. The time-averaged flow fields for the vortex
oscillations are symmetric, and no apparent asymmetry exists. Therefore, the
vortex pair over the forebody oscillates around a symmetric mean flow field.

planet conjunctions was developed and the spectra of the model variation and
the sunspot area variation compared. By including solar cycle amplitude
modulation and the effect of solar magnetic field reversal the model was able
to predict fine detail in the sunspot area spectrum. As Mercury planet
conjunctions occur predictably it was possible to compare the time variation of
band limited components of sunspot area with the corresponding component
variations in the model. When the model component variation was stable
corresponding components of sunspot area lagged the model variation by a few
tens of days. When a 180 degree phase change occurred in the model variation
the corresponding component of sunspot area followed the change over an
interval of a few hundred days, first by decreasing to zero and then emerging
in phase with the model variation. Where periodicities in sunspot area did not
match periods of Fourier components of the model the autocorrelation function
of the model variation provided an indirect numerical link to these
periodicities. Included in these indirect periodicities were components at
periods of about 138, 235, 355, 472, 530, 605, 833, 1190 and 2020 days. Direct
periodicities in the model, those linked directly to Fourier components of
sunspot area, included components at about 88, 116, 176, 200, 292 and 405 days.
The model was developed without allowing for a variable threshold for sunspot
emergence. However, it was found that with a variable threshold above which the
model variation is effective in triggering sunspots, weak Fourier components at
the indirect periods were generated. The model with threshold then encompasses
all of the significant intermediate range periodicities in sunspot area.

the development of a real-world Hindi-English machine translation system for
doctor-patient communication. As this is a low-resource language pair,
especially for speech and for the medical domain, our initial focus has been on
gathering suitable training data from various sources. We applied a variety of
methods ranging from fully automatic extraction from the Web to manual
annotation of test data. Moreover, we developed a method for automatically
augmenting the training data with synthetically generated variants, which
yielded a very sizable improvement of more than 3 BLEU points absolute.

conducted a set of $NLO$ calculations for the production of the electroweak

concluding that the results of the $KMR$ scheme are arguably better in

utilizing the $UPDF$ of $KMR$ within the dynamics of the recent data. It will
be shown that our results are in good agreement with the new measurements of

the source in an initial faint X-ray state and then undergoing a bright X-ray
outburst lasting about 7 ks. We studied the spectral variability during
outburst and quiescence by using a thermal and bulk Comptonization model that
is typically adopted to describe the X-ray spectral energy distribution of
young pulsars in high mass X-ray binaries. Although the statistics of the
collected X-ray data were relatively high we could neither confirm the presence
of a cyclotron line in the broad-band spectrum of the source (0.5-40 keV), nor
detect any of the previously reported tentative detection of the source spin

low emission state for most of the time, in agreement with the known property
of all supergiant fast X-ray transients being significantly sub-luminous
compared to other supergiant X-ray binaries. Optical and infrared observations
were carried out for a total of a few thousands of seconds during the
quiescence state of the source detected by XMM-Newton and NuSTAR. The measured

quality can improve the final results in cluster ensemble, it cannot control

introduces Independency as a supplementary method to be used in conjunction
with Diversity. Therefore, this paper uses a heuristic metric, which is based
on the procedure of converting code to graph in Software Testing, in order to
calculate the Independency of two basic clustering algorithms. Moreover, a new
modeling language, which we called as ""Clustering Algorithms Independency

Independency of algorithms. Also, Uniformity, which is a new similarity metric,
has been introduced for evaluating the diversity of basic results. As a
credential, our experimental results on varied different standard data sets

average difference between the reconstructed and the true positions in X and Y
directions does not exceed 0.2 mm in the central area of 22 x 22 mm2 and 0.4 mm
at the periphery of the camera. A similar level of image distortions is shown
experimentally with the camera prototype.

taking into account how similar agents' opinions are. We consider both the case
where opinions have one and two dimensions. We find that our dynamics produces
the segregation of agents into two cliques, with the opinions of agents in one
clique differing from those in the other. Depending on the level of bounded
confidence, the dynamics can produce either consensus of opinions within each
clique or the coexistence of several opinion clusters in a clique. For the
uni-dimensional case, the opinions in one clique are all below the opinions in
the other clique, hence defining a ""left clique"" and a ""right clique"". In the
two-dimensional case, our numerical results suggest that the two cliques are
separated by a hyperplane in the opinion space. We also show that the

its observations to a remote fusion center using an amplify-and-forward
strategy. We consider the design of optimal power allocation strategies in
order to minimize the mean-square error at the fusion center. Contrary to the
traditional approaches, the degree of correlation between the signal values
constitutes an important aspect of our formulation. We provide the optimal
power allocation strategies for a number of illustrative scenarios. We show
that the most majorized power allocation strategy, i.e. the power allocation as
balanced as possible, is optimal for the cases of circularly wide-sense
stationary (c.w.s.s.) signals with a static correlation coefficient, and
sampled low-pass c.w.s.s. signals for a static channel. We show that the
optimal strategy can be characterized as a water-filling type solution for
sampled low-pass c.w.s.s. signals for a fading channel. Motivated by the
high-complexity of the numerical solution of the optimization problem, we
propose low-complexity policies for the general scenario. Numerical evaluations
illustrate the close performance of these low-complexity policies to that of
the optimal policies, and demonstrate the effect of the EH constraints and the
degree of freedom of the signal.

the ""sparse regular approximation lemma"" (SRAL). The input to this lemma is a
graph $G$ of edge density $p$ and parameters $\epsilon, \delta$, where we think
of $\delta$ as a constant. The goal is to construct an $\epsilon$-regular
partition of $G$ while having the freedom to add/remove up to $\delta |E(G)|$
edges. As we show here, this weaker variant of the regularity lemma already
suffices for proving the graph removal lemma and the hypergraph regularity
lemma, which are two of the main applications of the (standard) regularity
lemma. This of course raises the following question: can one obtain
quantitative bounds for SRAL that are significantly better than those
associated with the regularity lemma?
  Our first result answers the above question affirmatively by proving an upper
bound for SRAL given by a tower of height $O(\log 1/p)$. This allows us to
reprove Fox's upper bound for the graph removal lemma. Our second result is a
matching lower bound for SRAL showing that a tower of height $\Omega(\log 1/p)$
is unavoidable. We in fact prove a more general multicolored lower bound which
is essential for proving lower bounds for the hypergraph regularity lemma.

possible universal bounds and the existence of holographic metal-insulator

projecting nonlinearities onto a polynomial basis and increasing the

electromagnetic scattering by particles, and concentrated solar power plant

are not accounted for in calibration catalogs is believed to be spectrally
smooth, deviations of true visibilities from model visibilities are not, due to
the inherent chromaticity of the interferometer's sky-response (the ""wedge"").
Thus, unmodeled foregrounds, below the confusion limit of many instruments,
introduce frequency structure into gain solutions on the same line-of-sight
scales on which we hope to observe the cosmological signal. We derive analytic
expressions describing these errors using linearized approximations of the
calibration equations and estimate the impact of this bias on measurements of
the 21\,cm power spectrum during the Epoch of Reionization (EoR). Given our
current precision in primary beam and foreground modeling, this noise will
significantly impact the sensitivity of existing experiments that rely on
sky-based calibration. Our formalism describes the scaling of calibration with
array and sky-model parameters and can be used to guide future instrument
design and calibration strategy. We find that sky-based calibration that
down-weights long baselines can eliminate contamination in most of the region

public only in the form of low-resolution bitmaps. We employ two separate image
processing methods, one based on the industry-standard OpenCV library and C++,
another based on self-developed algorithms in Python. We present the transverse
momentum and azimuthal angle distributions of the particles obtained through
both methods, in agreement with the literature.

at sentence level has been addressed. A novel method of extracting spatial
features to capture hand movements of a signer has been proposed. Frames of a
given video of a sign are preprocessed to extract face and hand components of a
signer. The local centroids of the extracted components along with the global
centroid are exploited to extract spatial features. The concept of interval
valued type symbolic data has been explored to capture variations in the same
sign made by the different signers at different instances of time. A suitable
symbolic similarity measure is studied to establish matching between test and
reference signs and a simple nearest neighbour classifier is used to recognize
an unknown sign as one among the known signs by specifying a desired level of
threshold. An extensive experimentation is conducted on a considerably large
database of signs created by us during the course of research work in order to
evaluate the performance of the proposed system

the optimal coherent communication waveform in the sense of using very simple
matched filter to maximize the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). Recently, Lyapunov
exponent spectrum of the chaotic signals after being transmitted through a
wireless channel has been shown to be unaltered, paving the way for wireless
communication using chaos. In wireless communication systems, inter-symbol
interference (ISI) caused by multipath propagation is one of the main obstacles
to achieve high bit transmission rate and low bit error rate (BER). How to
resist multipath effect is a fundamental problem in a chaos-based wireless
communication system (CWCS). In this paper, implementation of a CWCS is
presented. It is built to transmit chaotic signals generated by a hybrid
dynamical system and then to filter the received signals by using the
corresponding matched filter to decrease the noise effect and to detect the
binary information. We find that the multipath effect can be effectively
resisted by regrouping the return map of the received signal and by setting the
corresponding threshold based on the available information. We show that the
optimal threshold is a function of the channel parameters and of the
transmitted information symbols. Practically, the channel parameters are
time-variant, and the future information symbols are unavailable. In this case,
a suboptimal threshold (SOT) is proposed, and the BER using the SOT is derived
analytically. Simulation results show that the CWCS achieves a remarkable
competitive performance even under inaccurate channel parameters.
