introduce multi-structure, time-consistent, dynamic risk measures induced from

and the corresponding two-point function are explicitly written down in a gauge

the choice of the coordinate system, is based on a rigorous group theoretical
approach. Our result takes the form of a universal spin-two
(transverse-traceless) sector and a gauge-dependent spin-zero (pure-trace)
sector. Scalar equations are derived for the structure functions of each part.
We show that the spin-two sector can be written as the resulting action of a
second-order differential operator (the spin-two projector) on a massless
minimally coupled scalar field (the spin-two structure function). The operator
plays the role of a symmetric rank-$2$ polarization tensor and has a spacetime
dependence. The calculated spin-two projector grows logarithmically with
distance and also no dS-invariant solution for either structure functions
exist. We show that the logarithmically growing part and the dS-breaking
contribution to the spin-zero part can be dropped out, respectively, for
suitable choices of parameters `$a$' and `$b$'. Considering the
transverse-traceless graviton two-point function, however, shows that dS
breaking is universal (cannot be gauged away). More exactly, if one wants to
respect the covariance and positiveness conditions, the quantization of the dS
graviton field (as for any gauge field) cannot be carried out directly in a
Hilbert space and involves unphysical negative norm states. However, a suitable
adaptation (Krein spaces) of the Gupta-Bleuler scheme for massless fields,
based on the group theoretical approach, enables us to obtain the corresponding
two-point function satisfying the conditions of locality, covariance,
transversality, index symmetrizer, and tracelessness.

algorithms rely on low-cost active depth sensors. However, these sensors can be
easily interfered by other active sources and require relatively high power
consumption. As a result, they are currently not suitable for outdoor

poses using passive stereo which avoids these limitations. A benchmark with
18,000 stereo image pairs and 18,000 depth images captured from different

from the manual label) is thus proposed. This paper demonstrates that the
performance of the state-of-the art tracking/estimation algorithms can be
maintained with most stereo matching algorithms on the proposed benchmark, as
long as the hand segmentation is correct. As a result, a novel stereo-based
hand segmentation algorithm specially designed for hand tracking/estimation is
proposed. The quantitative evaluation demonstrates that the proposed algorithm
is suitable for the state-of-the-art hand pose tracking/estimation algorithms

large-scale shear, ranging from solar and galactic magnetism to accretion

numerical simulations we show that in non-helically forced turbulence with zero
mean magnetic field, large-scale shear supports small-scale dynamo action,
i.e., the dynamo growth rate increases with shear and shear enhances or even
produces turbulence, which, in turn, further increases the dynamo growth rate.
When the production rates of turbulent kinetic energy due to shear and forcing
are comparable, we find scalings for the growth rate $\gamma$ of the
small-scale dynamo and the turbulent velocity $u_{\rm rms}$ with shear rate $S$
that are independent of the magnetic Prandtl number: $\gamma \propto |S|$ and
$u_{\rm rms} \propto |S|^{2/3}$. For large fluid and magnetic Reynolds numbers,
$\gamma$, normalized by its shear-free value, depends only on shear. Having
compensated for shear-induced effects on turbulent velocity, we find that the
normalized growth rate of the small-scale dynamo exhibits the scaling,
$\widetilde{\gamma}\propto |S|^{2/3}$, arising solely from the induction

arrive at meaningful estimates for the reliability of a system, it is therefore

straightforward in the Bayesian approach by using an informative prior
distribution. A problem called prior-data conflict then can arise: observed
data seem very surprising from the viewpoint of the prior, i.e., information
from data is in conflict with prior assumptions. Models based on conjugate
priors can be insensitive to prior-data conflict, in the sense that the spread
of the posterior distribution does not increase in case of such a conflict,
thus conveying a false sense of certainty. An approach to mitigate this issue
is presented, by considering sets of prior distributions to model limited

robust Bayesian procedure or imprecise probability method that reflects

asks, given a graph $G$ on $n$ vertices and an integer $k$, whether there is a
set $S$ of at most $k$ vertices in $G$ such that $G-S$ is distance-hereditary.
This problem is important due to its connection to the graph parameter
rank-width that distance-hereditary graphs are exactly graphs of rank-width at
most $1$. Eiben, Ganian, and Kwon (MFCS' 16) proved that Distance-Hereditary
Vertex Deletion can be solved in time $2^{\mathcal{O}(k)}n^{\mathcal{O}(1)}$,
and asked whether it admits a polynomial kernelization. We show that this
problem admits a polynomial kernel, answering this question positively. For
this, we use a similar idea for obtaining an approximate solution for Chordal
Vertex Deletion due to Jansen and Pilipczuk (SODA' 17) to obtain an approximate
solution with $\mathcal{O}(k^3\log n)$ vertices when the problem is a

of CO white dwarfs (WDs) and mergers of CO WDs more massive than 0.47 $M_\odot$
with hybrid or helium WDs more massive than 0.37$M_\odot$ produce SNe Ia. The
models are parametrized by the product of the common envelope efficiency and
the parameter of binding energy of stellar envelopes $\alpha_{ce}\lambda$,
which we vary between 0.25 and 2. The best agreement with observations is
obtained for $\alpha_{ce}\lambda$=2. A substantial contribution to the rate of
SNe Ia is provided by the pairs with a hybrid WD. The estimated Galactic rate
of SNe Ia is $6.5 10^{-3}$ per yr (for the mass of the bulge and thin disk
equal to $7.2 10^{10} M_\odot$), which is comparable to the observational
estimate $(5.4\pm0.12) 10^{-3}$ per yr. The model DTD for 1 to 8 Gyr range
satisfactorily fits DTD for SNe Ia in the field galaxies (Maoz et al. 2012).
For this epoch, model DTD is a power low with an index -1.64. At earlier and
later epochs our DTD has a deficit of events, as in other studies. Marginal
agreement with observational DTD is achieved even if only CO+CO WD with
$M_1\geq0.8\,M_\odot$ and $M_2\geq0.6\,M_\odot$ produce SNe Ia. A better
agreement of observed and model DTD may be obtained if tidal effects are weaker
than assumed and/or metallicity of population is much lower than solar.

template matching and applications such as invariant features or novel

fundamental aspect of novel machine vision or deep learning algorithms, such as
convolutional neural networks (CNN), which perform shift and scale invariant

a multiplicative-error calculation of the output probability distribution of

multiplicative-error calculation (or even the sampling) with the same amount of

any polarization lower-bounded by an inverse polynomial, a classical efficient
sampling (in terms of a sufficiently small multiplicative error or an

simulations we explore their observational signatures in the infrared in order
to find out whether they can partly replace the molecular torus. Strong
variations of the brightness distributions are found, depending on the
orientation of the warp with respect to the line of sight. Whereas images at
short wavelengths typically show a disc-like and a point source component, the
warp itself only becomes visible at far-infrared wavelengths. A similar variety
is visible in the shapes of the spectral energy distributions. Especially for
close to edge-on views, the models show silicate feature strengths ranging from
deep absorption to strong emission for variations of the lines of sight towards
the warp. To test the applicability of our model, we use the case of the
Circinus galaxy, where infrared interferometry has revealed a highly elongated
emission component matching a warped maser disc in orientation and size. Our
model is for the first time able to present a physical explanation for the
observed dust morphology as coming from the AGN heated dust. As opposed to
available torus models, a warped disc morphology produces a variety of silicate
feature shapes for grazing lines of sight, close to an edge-on view. This could

would be a prime candidate for the first detailed atmospheric characterization
of a habitable-zone exoplanet using HST and JWST. Here, we report the detection
of a third transit of K2-18b near the predicted transit time using the Spitzer
Space Telescope. The Spitzer detection demonstrates the periodic nature of the
two transit events discovered by K2, confirming that K2-18 is indeed orbited by
a super-Earth in a 33-day orbit and ruling out the alternative scenario of two
similarly-sized, long-period planets transiting only once within the 75-day K2
observation. We also find, however, that the transit event detected by Spitzer
occurred 1.85 hours (7-sigma) before the predicted transit time. Our joint
analysis of the Spitzer and K2 photometry reveals that this early occurrence of
the transit is not caused by transit timing variations (TTVs), but the result
of an inaccurate K2 ephemeris due to a previously undetected data anomaly in
the K2 photometry likely caused by a cosmic ray hit. We refit the ephemeris and
find that K2-18b would have been lost for future atmospheric characterizations
with HST and JWST if we had not secured its ephemeris shortly after the
discovery. We caution that immediate follow-up observations as presented here
will also be critical in confirming and securing future planets discovered by
TESS, in particular if only two transit events are covered by the relatively
short 27-day TESS campaigns.

consider a slotted uncoordinated data transmission period during which machine
type communication (MTC) devices transmit over the same radio channel. Based on
the latency requirements, MTC devices are divided into groups of different
sizes, and the transmission frame is divided into subframes of different
lengths. In each subframe, each group is assigned an access probability based
on which an MTC device decides to transmit replicas of its packet or remain
silent. The base station (BS) employs successive interference cancellation
(SIC) to recover all the superposed packets. We derive the closed form
expressions for the average probability of device resolution for each group,
and we use these expressions to design the access probabilities. The accuracy
of the expressions is validated through Monte Carlo simulations. We show that
the designed access probabilities can guarantee the QoS requirements with high
reliability and high energy efficiency. Finally, we show that RMA can
outperform standard coordinated access schemes as well as some of the recently
proposed M2M access schemes for cellular networks.

Our methodology leverages active measurements of TCP timestamps and other

conducting several measurement runs and training in cross-validation rounds, we
aim to create models that generalize well and do not overfit our training data.
We find both models to exceed 99% precision in train and test performance. We
validate scalability by classifying 149k siblings in a large-scale measurement

cross-validated and likely to generalize well, can aid comparative studies of

error-free transmission and requires that Bob and Alice share a secret key.
Wyner in 1975 and later I.~Csisz\'ar and J.~K\""orner in 1978 modified the

be achieved without sharing a secret key. This model is called wiretap channel

channel.
  In this paper we review the concept of wiretap coding from the satellite
channel viewpoint. We also review subsequently introduced stronger secrecy
levels which can be numerically quantified and are keyless unconditionally
secure under certain assumptions. We introduce the general construction of
wiretap coding and analyse its applicability for a typical satellite channel.
From our analysis we discuss the potential of keyless information theoretic

shown how to realize such a system in practice using Zeeman sublevels in
$^{87}$Rb at 795nm [Opt. Commun. 402, 382-388 (2017)]. However, aLIGO operates
at 1064nm and suitable transitions in Rb or other alkali atoms are not

that is consistent with the operating wavelength of aLIGO. Here, we present the
realization of such an NDM at 1064nm with a microresonator, which supports
optomechanical interaction. A strong control field is applied at a higher
frequency, and, under certain conditions, a probe field at a lower frequency
experiences a peak at the center of an absorption profile, and a negative
dispersion in the transmission. Unlike in the GEIT case, we use the
compound-cavity signal-recycling (CC-SR) scheme, where an auxiliary mirror is
inserted in the dark port of the detector, and show that the enhancement factor
can be as high as ~15. However, using the parameters required for the
sensitivity enhancement, the optomechanical system enters an instability region
where the control field is depleted. We present an observer based feedback

state, in which the time-averaged mass accretion rate onto the binary,
$\langle\dot{M}\rangle$, matches the mass supply rate at the outer disc. We
focus on binaries with comparable masses and a wide range of eccentricities
($e_\mathrm{B}$). For $e_\mathrm{B} \lesssim 0.05$, the mass accretion rate of
the binary is modulated at about $5$ times the binary period; otherwise it is
modulated at the binary period. The inner part of the circumbinary disc ($r
\lesssim 6 a_\mathrm{B}$) generally becomes coherently eccentric. For low and
high $e_\mathrm{B}$, the disc line of apsides precesses around the binary, but
for intermediate $e_\mathrm{B}$ ($0.2 - 0.4$), it instead becomes locked with
that of the binary. By considering the balance of angular momentum transport
through the disc by advection, viscous stress, and gravitational torque, we
determine the time-averaged net angular momentum transfer rate to the binary,
$\langle\dot{J}\rangle$. The specific angular momentum, $l_0 =
\langle\dot{J}\rangle/\langle\dot{M}\rangle$, depends non-monotonically on
$e_\mathrm{B}$. Contrary to previous claims, we find that $l_0$ is positive for
most $e_\mathrm{B}$, implying that the binary receives net angular momentum,
which may cause its separation to grow with time. The minimum $l_0$ occurs at
intermediate $e_\mathrm{B}$ ($0.2 - 0.4$), corresponding to the regime where
the inner eccentric disc is apsidally aligned with the binary.

the existence of an upper bound on the expectation value of the turn-around
radius which is rarely violated by individual galaxy groups. We speculate that
a deviation of the gravitational law from GR on the cosmological scale could
cause an appreciable shift of the mean turn-around radius to higher values and
make the occurrence of the bound violation more probable. Analyzing the data
from high-resolution N-body simulations for two specific models with modified
gravity (MG) and the standard GR+$\Lambda$CDM cosmology, we determine the
turn-around radii of the massive Rockstar groups from the peculiar motions of
the galactic halos located in the bound zone where the fifth force generated by
MG is expected to be at most partially shielded. We detect a $4\sigma$ signal
of difference in the odds of the bound violations between a fiducial MG and the
GR models, proving that the odds of the bound violations increase with the
strength of the fifth force produced by the presence of MG. The advantage of
using the odds of the bound violations as a complementary diagnostics to probe
the nature of gravity is discussed.

dimensional brain signals whose statistical properties evolve over the course
of a non-spatial memory experiment. Under E-SSM, brain signals are modeled as
mixtures of components (e.g., AR(2) process) with oscillatory activity at
pre-defined frequency bands. To account for the potential non-stationarity of
these components (since the brain responses could vary throughout the entire
experiment), the parameters are allowed to vary over epochs. Compared with
classical approaches such as independent component analysis and filtering, the
proposed method accounts for the entire temporal correlation of the components
and accommodates non-stationarity. For inference purpose, we propose a novel
computational algorithm based upon using Kalman smoother, maximum likelihood
and blocked resampling. The E-SSM model is applied to simulation studies and an
application to a multi-epoch local field potentials (LFP) signal data collected
from a non-spatial (olfactory) sequence memory task study. The results confirm
that our method captures the evolution of the power for different components
across different phases in the experiment and identifies clusters of electrodes
that behave similarly with respect to the decomposition of different sources.
These findings suggest that the activity of different electrodes does change
over the course of an experiment in practice, treating these epoch recordings
as realizations of an identical process could lead to misleading results. In
summary, the proposed method underscores the importance of capturing the
evolution in brain responses over the study period.

axisymmetric two-dimensional collapsing core model with post-processing gas-ice
astrochemical simulations, in which a layered ice structure is considered. The
physical and chemical evolutions are followed until the end of the main
accretion phase. When mass averaged over the whole disk, a forming disk has a
similar H2O abundance and HDO/H2O abundance ratio as their precollapse values
(within a factor of 2), regardless of time in our models. Consistent with
previous studies, our models suggest that interstellar water ice is delivered
to forming disks without significant alteration. On the other hand, the local
vertically averaged H2O ice abundance and HDO/H2O ice ratio can differ more, by
up to a factor of several, depending on time and distance from a central star.
Key parameters for the local variations are the fluence of stellar UV photons
en route into the disk and the ice layered structure, the latter of which is
mostly established in the prestellar stages. We also find that even if
interstellar water ice is destroyed by stellar UV and (partly) reformed prior
to disk entry, the HDO/H2O ratio in reformed water ice is similar to the
original value. This finding indicates that some caution is needed in
discussions on the prestellar inheritance of H2O based on comparisons between

  approach",,,,,"q-fin.ST","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The bubble is a controversial and important issue. Many methods which based
on the rational expectation have been proposed to detect the bubble. However,
for some developing countries, epically China, the asset markets are so young
that for many companies, there are no dividends and fundamental value, making
it difficult (if not impossible) to measure the bubbles by existing methods.
Therefore, we proposed a simple but effective statistical method and three
statistics (that is, C, U, V) to capture and quantify asset price bubbles,
especially in immature emerging markets. To present a clear example of the
application of this method to real world problems, we also applied our method
to re-examine empirically the asset price bubble in some stock markets. Our
main contributions to current literature are as follows: firstly, this method
does not rely on fundamental value, the discount rates and dividends, therefore
is applicable to the immature markets without the sufficient data of such
kinds, secondly, this new method allows us to examine different influences
(herding behavior, abnormal fluctuation and composite influence) of bubble. Our
new statistical approach is, to the best of our knowledge, the only robust way
in existing literature to to quantify the asset price bubble especially in
emerging markets.

  Theoretical",,,,"quant-ph math-ph math.MP","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Families of one-point interactions are derived from the system consisting of
regularized two- and three-delta potentials using different paths of the
convergence of corresponding transmission matrices in the squeezing limit. This
limit is controlled by the relative rate of shrinking the width of delta-like
functions and the distance between these functions using the power
parameterization: width $l =\varepsilon^{\mu -1}$, $\mu \in [2,\, \infty]$ (for
width) and $r = \varepsilon^\tau$, $\tau \in [1,\, \infty]$ (for distance). It
is shown that at some values of real coefficients (intensities $a_1$, $a_2$ and
$a_3$) at the delta potentials, the transmission across the limit point
interactions is non-zero, whereas outside these (resonance) values the
one-point interactions are opaque splitting the system at the point of
singularity into two independent subsystems. The resonance sets of intensities
at which a non-zero transmission occurs are proved to be of four types
depending on the way of squeezing the regularized system to one point. In its
turn, on these sets the limit one-point interactions are observed to be either
single- or multiple-resonant-tunnelling potentials also depending on the
squeezing way. In the two-delta case the resonance sets are curves on the
$(a_1,a_2)$-plane and surfaces in the $(a_1,a_2,a_3)$-space for the three-delta
system. A new phenomenon of furcation of single-valued resonance sets to
multi-valued ones is observed under approaching the parameter $\mu >2$ to the
value $\mu =2$.

it provides a quick and easy measure to compare different energy resource

large-scale power plants and distributed generations (DGs) is extensively
studied and can be found in the literature. The discussions on the LCOE
calculation for energy storage systems, however, is limited. Although still
relatively expensive compared to generation technologies, energy storage is
gaining significant attention and has been deployed extensively during the past
few years, conceivably due to its many benefits such as load shifting, energy
arbitrage, and renewable coordination. Therefore, LCOE calculation of energy

population structure in genetic datasets has been traditionally analyzed using
either model-free algorithms, such as principal components analysis (PCA) and
multidimensional scaling, or using explicit spatial probabilistic models of
allele frequency evolution. We develop a general probabilistic model and an
associated inference algorithm that unify the model-based and data-driven
approaches to visualizing and inferring population structure. Our algorithm,
Geographic Ancestry Positioning (GAP), relates local genetic distances between
samples to their spatial distances, and can be used for visually discerning
population structure as well as accurately inferring the spatial origin of
individuals on a two-dimensional continuum. On both simulated and several real
datasets from diverse human populations, GAP exhibits substantially lower error
in reconstructing spatial ancestry coordinates compared to PCA.
  Our spatial inference algorithm can also be effectively applied to the
problem of population stratification in genome-wide association studies (GWAS),
where hidden population structure can create fictitious associations when
population ancestry is correlated with both the genotype and the trait. We
develop an association test that uses the ancestry coordinates inferred by GAP
to accurately account for ancestry-induced correlations in GWAS. Based on
simulations and analysis of a dataset of 10 metabolic traits measured in a
Northern Finland cohort, which is known to exhibit significant population
structure, we find that our method has superior power to current approaches.

increased tremendously, many statistical software tools are still limited to

dense linear algebra operations, which have been deeply studied, optimized and
parallelized in the high-performance-computing community. To make
high-performance distributed computations available for statistical analysis,
and thus enable large scale statistical computations, we introduce RElem, an
open source package that integrates the distributed dense linear algebra
library Elemental into R. While on the one hand, RElem provides direct wrappers
of Elemental's routines, on the other hand, it overloads various operators and
functions to provide an entirely native R experience for distributed
computations. We showcase how simple it is to port existing R programs to Relem

an emergent geometric description for a topological phase transition in the
Kitaev superconductor model. An effective field theory consists of an emergent
bulk action with an extra dimension, an ultraviolet (UV) boundary condition for
an initial value of a coupling function, and an infrared (IR) effective action
with a fully renormalized coupling function. The bulk action describes the
evolution of the coupling function along the direction of the extra dimension,
where the extra dimension is identified with an RG scale and the resulting
equation of motion is nothing but a $\beta-$function. In particular, the IR
effective field theory turns out to be consistent with a Callan-Symanzik
equation which takes into account both the bulk and IR boundary contributions.
This derived Callan-Symanzik equation gives rise to a metric structure. Based
on this emergent metric tensor, we uncover the equivalence of the entanglement
entropy between the emergent geometric description and the quantum field theory
in the vicinity of the quantum critical point.

polynomial approximation error when using downward closed sets of cardinality
$n$. We establish conditions between the dimension $n$ and the size $m$ of the

finding is that the dimension $d$ enters only moderately in the resulting
trade-off between $m$ and $n$, in terms of a logarithmic factor $\ln(d)$, and
is even absent when the optimization is restricted to a relevant subclass of

data-driven applications. Sophisticated similarity measures are standard for
time series matching, as they are usually misaligned. Dynamic Time Warping or
DTW is the most widely used similarity measure for time series because it
combines alignment and matching at the same time. However, the alignment makes
DTW slow. To speed up the expensive similarity search with DTW, branch and
bound based pruning strategies are adopted. However, branch and bound based
pruning are only useful for very short queries (low dimensional time series),
and the bounds are quite weak for longer queries. Due to the loose bounds
branch and bound pruning strategy boils down to a brute-force search.
  To circumvent this issue, we design SSH (Sketch, Shingle, & Hashing), an
efficient and approximate hashing scheme which is much faster than the
state-of-the-art branch and bound searching technique: the UCR suite. SSH uses
a novel combination of sketching, shingling and hashing techniques to produce
(probabilistic) indexes which align (near perfectly) with DTW similarity
measure. The generated indexes are then used to create hash buckets for
sub-linear search. Our results show that SSH is very effective for longer time
sequence and prunes around 95% candidates, leading to the massive speedup in
search with DTW. Empirical results on two large-scale benchmark time series
data show that our proposed method can be around 20 times faster than the
state-of-the-art package (UCR suite) without any significant loss in accuracy.

characterizing the coherence of a given quantum state. However, it seems
difficult to estimate the optimal incoherent state for high dimensional states.
An explicit expression for the trace distance measure of coherence for a class
of qudit states is provided. We show that the closest incoherent state to the
class of qudit states is just the diagonal matrix obtained from it by deleting
all off-diagonal elements. It is also shown that the measure of coherence
induced by trace distance can act as a measure of coherence for this class of
qudit states with some restrictions on the strictly incoherent operations.

parameter $q(z)$ in a model for the spatially flat FRW universe filled with
dark energy and non-relativistic matter. In cosmology, the parametric
reconstruction technique deals with an attempt to build up a model by choosing
some specific evolution scenario for a cosmological parameter and then estimate
the values of the parameters with the help of different observational datasets.
In this paper, we have proposed a logarithmic parametrization of $q(z)$ to
probe the evolution history of the universe. Using the type Ia supernova
(SNIa), baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) and the cosmic microwave background
(CMB) datasets, the constraints on the arbitrary model parameters $q_{0}$ and
$q_{1}$ are obtained (within $1\sigma$ and $2\sigma$ confidence limits) by
$\chi^{2}$-minimization technique. We have then reconstructed the deceleration
parameter, the total EoS parameter $\omega_{tot}$, the jerk parameter and have
compared the reconstructed results of $q(z)$ with other well-known
parametrizations of $q(z)$. We have also shown that two model selection
criteria (namely, Akaike information criterion and Bayesian Information
Criterion) provide the clear indication that our reconstructed model is well
consistent with other popular models.

$w_{dm}\ge 0$, $w_{m}\ge 0$ and $w_{r}\ge 0$ values. These strange attractors
with the positive Lyapunov exponent clearly show that chaotic dynamics appears
in time evolution of the densities. These results imply that the time evolution
of the universe is chaotic in the presence of interactions between these

machine. Machines are used more efficiently, but tasks' performance
deteriorates, as colocated tasks compete for shared resources. As tasks are
heterogeneous, the resulting performance dependencies are complex. In our
previous work [18] we proposed a new combinatorial optimization model that uses
two parameters of a task - its size and its type - to characterize how a task
influences the performance of other tasks allocated to the same machine.
  In this paper, we study the egalitarian optimization goal: maximizing the
worst-off performance. This problem generalizes the classic makespan
minimization on multiple processors (P||Cmax). We prove that
polynomially-solvable variants of multiprocessor scheduling are NP-hard and
hard to approximate when the number of types is not constant. For a constant
number of types, we propose a PTAS, a fast approximation algorithm, and a
series of heuristics. We simulate the algorithms on instances derived from a
trace of one of Google clusters. Algorithms aware of jobs' types lead to better
performance compared with algorithms solving P||Cmax.
  The notion of type enables us to model degeneration of performance caused by
using standard combinatorial optimization methods. Types add a layer of
additional complexity. However, our results - approximation algorithms and good
average-case performance - show that types can be handled efficiently.

boundaries on the mechanical properties and failure behavior of phosphorene. We
found that the large angle tilt boundaries with a higher density of (5|7)
defect pairs (oriented along the AC direction) are stronger than the low-angle
tilt boundaries with a lower defect density, and similarly the large angle
boundaries with a higher density of (4|8) defect pairs (oriented along the ZZ
direction) are stronger than the low-angle boundaries with a lower defect
density. The failure is due to the rupture of the most pre-strained bonds in
the heptagons of the (5|7) defect pair or octagons of the (4|8) pairs. The
large-angle grain boundaries are better off in accommodating the pre-strained
bonds in heptagons and octagons defects, leading to a higher failure stress and
strain. The results cannot be described by Griffith-type fracture mechanics
criterion since it does not take into account the bond pre-stretching.
Interestingly, these anomalous mechanical and failure characteristics of tilt
grain boundaries in phosphorene are also shared by graphene and hexagonal
born-nitride, signifying that they may be universal for 2D materials. The
findings revealed here may be useful in tuning the mechanical properties of
phosphorene via defect engineering for specific applications.

cells confined between two parallel walls via mesoscale hydrodynamic
simulations, combining molecular dynamics simulations of the swarmer cell with
the multiparticle particle collision dynamics approach for the embedding fluid.
E. coli-type swarmer cells are three-times longer than their planktonic counter

separation, we analyze the confinement effect on the flagella arrangement, on
the distribution of cells in the gap between the walls, and on the cell
dynamics. We find only a weak dependence of confinement on the bundle structure
and dynamics. The distribution of cells in the gap changes from a
geometry-dominated behavior for very narrow to fluid-dominated behavior for
wider gaps, where cells are preferentially located in the gap center for
narrower gaps and stay preferentially next to one of the walls for wider gaps.
Dynamically, the cells exhibit a wide spectrum of migration behaviors,
depending on their flagella bundle arrangement, and ranges from straight
swimming to wall rolling.

increases or decreases. The type of phase transition depends on the
cosmological constant $\Lambda$ as well as the vacuum expectation value $v$ and
the coupling constant $\lambda$ of the Higgs field. Fixing $\lambda$ small, we
find there are two critical values of the cosmological constant $\Lambda_{\rm
cr (1)}(v)$ and $\Lambda_{\rm cr(2)}(v)$, which depend on $v$. If $\Lambda_{\rm
cr(1)}(v)<\Lambda (<0)$, we find the first order transition, while if
$\Lambda_{\rm cr(2)}(v)<\Lambda<\Lambda_{\rm cr(1)}(v)$, the transition becomes
second order. For the case of $\Lambda_{b}(v)<\Lambda<\Lambda_{\rm (2)}(v)$, we
again find the first order irreversible transition from the monopole black hole
to the extreme Reissner-Nordstr\""{o}m black hole. Beyond $\Lambda_{b}(v)$, no
monopole black hole exists. We also discuss thermodynamical properties of the
monopole black hole in a thermal bath system.

The key idea is to define the regularisation matrix as a filtering operation on

from an engineering point of view. Moreover, this results in a unified
framework to model low-pass, band-pass and high-pass systems, and systems with

evidence for repeating spatiotemporal spike patterns, which can carry
information. How this information is extracted by downstream neurons is
unclear. In this theoretical paper, we investigate to what extent a single cell
could detect a given spike pattern and what the optimal parameters to do so
are, in particular the membrane time constant $\tau$. Using a leaky
integrate-and-fire (LIF) neuron with instantaneous synapses and homogeneous
Poisson input, we were able to compute this optimum analytically. Our results
indicate that a relatively small $\tau$ (at most a few tens of ms) is usually
optimal, even when the pattern is much longer. This is somewhat counter
intuitive as the resulting detector ignores most of the pattern, due to its
fast memory decay. Next, we wondered if spike-timing-dependent plasticity
(STDP) could enable a neuron to reach the theoretical optimum. We simulated a
LIF neuron equipped with additive spike-timing-dependent potentiation and
homeostatic rate-based depression, and repeatedly exposed it to a given input
spike pattern. As in previous studies, the LIF progressively became selective
to the repeating pattern with no supervision, even when the pattern was
embedded in Poisson activity. Here we show that, using certain STDP parameters,
the resulting pattern detector can be optimal. Taken together, these results
may explain how humans can learn repeating visual or auditory sequences. Long
sequences could be recognized thanks to coincidence detectors working at a much
shorter timescale. This is consistent with the fact that recognition is still
possible if a sound sequence is compressed, played backward, or scrambled using
10ms bins. Coincidence detection is a simple yet powerful mechanism, which
could be the main function of neurons in the brain.

Therefore, the ideal-gas-based description of absorption is no longer adequate,

illustrated with severe problems in fitting the spectra of cool, He-rich stars.

fields. However the size and slow rotation of these galaxies appear
insufficient to support a mean-field dynamo action to excite such fields. Here
we suggest a new mechanism to explain large-scale magnetic fields in galaxies
that are too small to support mean-field dynamo action. The key idea is that we
do not identify large-scale and mean magnetic fields. In our scenario the the
magnetic structures originate from a small-scale dynamo which produces
small-scale magnetic field in the galactic disc and a galactic wind that
transports this field into the galactic halo where the large turbulent
diffusion increases the scale and order of the field. As a result, the magnetic
field becomes large-scale; however its mean value remains vanishing in a strict
sense. We verify the idea by numerical modelling of two distinct simplified
configurations, a thin disc model using the no-$z$ approximation, and an
axisymmetric model using cylindrical $r,z$ coordinates. Each of these allows
reduction of the problem to two spatial dimensions. Taken together, the models
support the proposition that the general trends will persist in a fully 3D
model. We demonstrate that a pronounced large-scale pattern can develop in the
galactic halo for a wide choice of the dynamo governing parameters. We believe
that our mechanism can be relevant to explaining the presence of the fields
observed in the halos of dwarf galaxies. We emphasize that detailed modelling
of the proposed scenario needs 3D simulations, and adjustment to the specific
dynamo governing parameters of dwarf galaxies.

governed by the spin current response of NiO layer. We explain the negative SMR

magnetic structure in antiferromagnets for transport of pure spin current in

producing all kinds of updates related to news stories, albeit with the caveat
that some of those early updates tend to be rumours, i.e., information with an
unverified status at the time of posting. Flagging information that is
unverified can be helpful to avoid the spread of information that may turn out
to be false. Detection of rumours can also feed a rumour tracking system that
ultimately determines their veracity. In this paper we introduce a novel
approach to rumour detection that learns from the sequential dynamics of
reporting during breaking news in social media to detect rumours in new
stories. Using Twitter datasets collected during five breaking news stories, we
experiment with Conditional Random Fields as a sequential classifier that
leverages context learnt during an event for rumour detection, which we compare
with the state-of-the-art rumour detection system as well as other baselines.
In contrast to existing work, our classifier does not need to observe tweets
querying a piece of information to deem it a rumour, but instead we detect
rumours from the tweet alone by exploiting context learnt during the event. Our
classifier achieves competitive performance, beating the state-of-the-art
classifier that relies on querying tweets with improved precision and recall,
as well as outperforming our best baseline with nearly 40% improvement in terms
of F1 score. The scale and diversity of our experiments reinforces the
generalisability of our classifier.

tricky in practice. This article aims at the purpose of providing an assistance
to a proper way of describing reactions theoretically and provides rough
guidelines to the computational methods involved.
  Reactions in liquid phase chemical equilibrium can be described theoretically
in terms of the Gibbs free energy of reaction. This property can be divided
into a sum of three disjunct terms, namely the gas phase reaction energy, the
finite temperature contribution to the Gibbs free energy, and the Gibbs free
energy of solvation. The three contributions to the Gibbs free energy of
reaction can be computed separately, using different theoretico--chemical
calculation methods. While some of these terms can be obtained reliably by
computationally cheap methods, for others a high level of theory is required to
obtain predictions of quantitative quality.
  In order to propose workflows which can strike the balance between accuracy
and computational cost, a number of benchmarks assessing the precision of
different levels of theory is given.

detergents present in the sample buffer, either beta-cyclodextrin or
alpha-cyclodextrin can be used, the former being able to complex a wider range
of detergents and the latter being able to complex higher amounts of detergents
due to its greater solubility in water. Cyclodextrins are used at final

samples containing as little as 0.1 mg/mL protein, in the presence of up to 2%

wave functions from coupled channel (CC) calculations involving specific
reaction processes, and, (ii) elastic channel wave functions calculated from
local potentials that exactly reproduce the elastic scattering $S$-matrix from

These will enable the study of the effects of dynamical non-locality following
a method previously employed in an investigation of the effects of non-locality
due to target excitation. In this work we consider only excitations due to
deuteron breakup, and some new properties of the breakup dynamical polarization
potential (DPP) emerge that reveal dynamical non-locality directly. In
addition, we evaluate the TELP inversion method and find that it fails to

producing a detector response matrix (DRM) and follow-up observations by other
instruments. The Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM) has the largest field of
view (FOV) for detecting GRBs as it views the entire unocculted sky, but as a
non-imaging instrument it relies on the relative count rates observed in each
of its 14 detectors to localize transients. Improving its ability to accurately
locate GRBs and other transients is vital to the paradigm of multi-messenger
astronomy, including the electromagnetic follow-up of gravitational wave
signals. Here we present the BAyesian Location Reconstruction Of GRBs ({\tt
BALROG}) method for localizing and characterising GBM transients. Our approach
eliminates the systematics of previous approaches by simultaneously fitting for
the location and spectrum of a source. It also correctly incorporates the
uncertainties in the location of a transient into the spectral parameters and
produces reliable positional uncertainties for both well-localized sources and
those for which the GBM data cannot effectively constrain the position. While
computationally expensive, {\tt BALROG} can be implemented to enable quick
follow-up of all GBM transient signals. Also, we identify possible response
problems that require attention as well as caution when using standard, public
GBM DRMs. Finally, we examine the effects of including the variance in location
on the spectral parameters of GRB 080916C. We find that spectral parameters
change and no extra components are required when these effects are included in
contrast to when we use a fixed location. This finding has the potential to
alter both the GRB spectral catalogs as well as the reported spectral
composition of some well-known GRBs.

an adaptive boundary matching algorithm is presented for recovering the damaged
motion vectors (MVs). This algorithm uses an outer boundary matching or
directional temporal boundary matching method to compare every boundary of
candidate macroblocks (MBs), adaptively. It gives a specific weight according
to the accuracy of each boundary of the damaged MB. Moreover, if each of the
adjacent MBs is already concealed, different weights are given to the
boundaries. Finally, the MV with minimum adaptive boundary distortion is
selected as the MV of the damaged MB. Experimental results show that the
proposed algorithm can improve both objective and subjective quality of
reconstructed frames without any considerable computational complexity. The

dimensions is associated with a generalized global symmetry. We study the
realization of such a symmetry at finite temperature and develop the
hydrodynamic theory describing fluctuations of a conserved 2-form current
around thermal equilibrium. This can be thought of as a systematic derivation
of relativistic magnetohydrodynamics, constrained only by symmetries and
effective field theory. We construct the entropy current and show that at first
order in derivatives, there are seven dissipative transport coefficients. We
present a universal definition of resistivity in a theory of dynamical
electromagnetism and derive a direct Kubo formula for the resistivity in terms
of correlation functions of the electric field operator. We also study
fluctuations and collective modes, deriving novel expressions for the
dissipative widths of magnetosonic and Alfven modes. Finally, we demonstrate
that a non-trivial truncation of the theory can be performed at low
temperatures compared to the magnetic field: this theory has an emergent
Lorentz invariance along magnetic field lines, and hydrodynamic fluctuations
are now parametrized by a fluid tensor rather than a fluid velocity.
Throughout, no assumption is made of weak electromagnetic coupling. Thus, our
theory may have phenomenological relevance for dense electromagnetic plasmas.

their thermodynamic metastability with respect to crystals. However, here we
present specific examples of interactions that eliminate the possibilities of

amorphous glasses down to absolute zero temperature. We show that this can be
accomplished by introducing a new ideal state of matter called a ""perfect

regarded as the epitome of a glass since they are out of equilibrium, maximally

moduli, and can never crystallize due to configuration-space trapping. Our
model perfect glass utilizes two-, three-, and four-body soft interactions
while simultaneously retaining the salient attributes of the MRJ state. These
models constitute a theoretical proof of concept for perfect glasses and
broaden our fundamental understanding of glass physics. A novel feature of
equilibrium systems of identical particles interacting with the perfect-glass
potential at positive temperature is that they have a non-relativistic speed of
sound that is infinite.

the role of reciprocity in the emergence of cooperation. However, the stability
of TFT does not hold in the presence of implementation error, and a TFT
population is prone to neutral drift to unconditional cooperation, which
eventually invites defectors. We argue that a combination of TFT and anti-TFT
(ATFT) overcomes these difficulties in a noisy environment, provided that ATFT
is defined as choosing the opposite to the opponent's last move. According to
this TFT-ATFT strategy, a player normally uses TFT; turns to ATFT upon
recognizing his or her own error; returns to TFT either when mutual cooperation
is recovered or when the opponent unilaterally defects twice in a row. The
proposed strategy provides simple and deterministic behavioral rules for
correcting implementation error in a way that cannot be exploited by the
opponent, and suppresses the neutral drift to unconditional cooperation.

than current networks. With the advent of Network Function Virtualization
(NFV), Network Functions (NF) will no longer be tightly coupled with the
hardware they are running on, which poses new challenges in network management.
Noisy neighbor is a term commonly used to describe situations in NFV
infrastructure where an application experiences degradation in performance due
to the fact that some of the resources it needs are occupied by other
applications in the same cloud node. These situations cannot be easily
identified using straightforward approaches, which calls for the use of
sophisticated methods for NFV infrastructure management. In this paper we
demonstrate how Machine Learning (ML) techniques can be used to identify such
events. Through experiments using data collected at real NFV infrastructure, we
show that standard models for automated classification can detect the noisy
neighbor phenomenon with an accuracy of more than 90% in a simple scenario.

the path to employ the theoretical framework of the diffusive random walk for

Indeed, we employ this random walk model to estimate the seeding density
required to minimise the occurrence of hESC colonies arising from more than one
founder cell and the minimal cell number needed for successful colony
formation. We believe that our prognostic model can be extended to investigate
the kinematic behaviour of somatic cells emerging from hESC differentiation and
to enable its wide application in phenotyping of pluripotent stem cells for
large scale stem cell culture expansion and differentiation platforms.

designing and increasing the safety of civil facilities. A key feature of
crowds is its intrinsic stochasticity, appearing even under very diluted
conditions, due to the variability in individual behaviours. Individual
stochasticity becomes even more important under densely crowded conditions,
since it can be nonlinearly magnified and may lead to potentially dangerous
collective behaviours. To understand quantitatively crowd stochasticity, we
study the real-life dynamics of a large ensemble of pedestrians walking
undisturbed, and we perform a statistical analysis of the fully-resolved
pedestrian trajectories obtained by a year-long high-resolution measurement
campaign. Our measurements have been carried out in a corridor of the Eindhoven
University of Technology via a combination of Microsoft Kinect 3D-range sensor
and automatic head-tracking algorithms. The temporal homogeneity of our large
database of trajectories allows us to robustly define and separate average
walking behaviours from fluctuations parallel and orthogonal with respect to
the average walking path. Fluctuations include rare events when individuals
suddenly change their minds and invert their walking direction. Such tendency
to invert direction has been poorly studied so far even if it may have
important implications on the functioning and safety of facilities. We propose
a novel model for the dynamics of undisturbed pedestrians, based on stochastic
differential equations, that provides a good agreement with our experimental
observations, including the occurrence of rare events.

that list: the development of sophisticated natural language semantics is a
sine qua non for achieving a level of intelligence comparable to humans.
Embodiment theories in cognitive science hold that human semantic
representation depends on sensori-motor experience; the abundant evidence that
human meaning representation is grounded in the perception of physical reality
leads to the conclusion that meaning must depend on a fusion of multiple
(perceptual) modalities. Despite this, AI research in general, and its
subdisciplines such as computational linguistics and computer vision in
particular, have focused primarily on tasks that involve a single modality.

with the square of the time series length. We propose a heuristic method that

  Moreover, we manage to drop the squarefree conjecture assumption under some

of great importance to elucidate the mechanisms behind neuro-degenerative
disorders and is recommended as part of study standards for small vessel

various brain regions and the existence of other similar-looking structures,

consistent computer-aided detection (CAD) routines.
  In this paper, we propose an automated two-stage method using deep
convolutional neural networks (CNN). We show that this method has good
performance and can considerably benefit readers. We first use a fully
convolutional neural network to detect initial candidates. In the second step,
we employ a 3D CNN as a false positive reduction tool. As the location
information is important to the analysis of candidate structures, we further
equip the network with contextual information using multi-scale analysis and
integration of explicit location features. We trained, validated and tested our
networks on a large dataset of 1075 cases obtained from two different studies.
Subsequently, we conducted an observer study with four trained observers and
compared our method with them using a free-response operating characteristic
analysis. Shown on a test set of 111 cases, the resulting CAD system exhibits
performance similar to the trained human observers and achieves a sensitivity
of 0.974 with 0.13 false positives per slice. A feasibility study also showed
that a trained human observer would considerably benefit once aided by the CAD

networks (NNs) in a distributed environment, where training data is partitioned
over a set of agents that communicate with each other through a sparse,
possibly time-varying, connectivity pattern. In such distributed scenario, the
training problem can be formulated as the (regularized) optimization of a
non-convex social cost function, given by the sum of local (non-convex) costs,
where each agent contributes with a single error term defined with respect to
its local dataset. To devise a flexible and efficient solution, we customize a
recently proposed framework for non-convex optimization over networks, which
hinges on a (primal) convexification-decomposition technique to handle
non-convexity, and a dynamic consensus procedure to diffuse information among
the agents. Several typical choices for the training criterion (e.g., squared
loss, cross entropy, etc.) and regularization (e.g., $\ell_2$ norm, sparsity
inducing penalties, etc.) are included in the framework and explored along the
paper. Convergence to a stationary solution of the social non-convex problem is
guaranteed under mild assumptions. Additionally, we show a principled way
allowing each agent to exploit a possible multi-core architecture (e.g., a
local cloud) in order to parallelize its local optimization step, resulting in
strategies that are both distributed (across the agents) and parallel (inside
each agent) in nature. A comprehensive set of experimental results validate the
proposed approach.

the Sunrise balloon-borne solar observatory. The entire field of view, spanning
the polarity inversion line of an active region close to the solar disk center,
is covered with bright, thin, and very dynamic fine structures. Our analysis
reveals the prevalence of transverse waves in SCFs with median amplitudes and
periods on the order of 2.4+-0.8 km/s and 83+-29 s, respectively (with standard
deviations given as uncertainties). We find that the transverse waves often
propagate along (parts of) the SCFs with median phase speeds of 9+-14 km/s.
While the propagation is only in one direction along the axis in some of the
SCFs, propagating waves in both directions, as well as standing waves are also
observed. The transverse oscillations are likely Alfvenic and are thought to be
representative of magnetohydrodynamic kink waves. The wave propagation suggests
that the rapid high-frequency transverse waves, often produced in the lower
photosphere, can penetrate into the chromosphere with an estimated energy flux
of ~ 15 kW/m^2. Characteristics of these waves differ from those reported for
other fibrillar structures, which, however, were observed mainly in the upper
solar chromosphere.

risk management and many other applications in finance. It is well-known that
financial time series display conditional heteroscedasticity. Among the large
number of conditional heteroscedastic models, the generalized autoregressive
conditional heteroscedastic (GARCH) process is the most popular and influential
one. So far, feasible quantile regression methods for this task have been
confined to a variant of the GARCH model, the linear GARCH model, owing to its
tractable conditional quantile structure. This paper considers the widely used
GARCH model. An easy-to-implement hybrid conditional quantile estimation
procedure is developed based on a simple albeit nontrivial transformation.
Asymptotic properties of the proposed estimator and statistics are derived,
which facilitate corresponding inferences. To approximate the asymptotic
distribution of the quantile regression estimator, we introduce a mixed
bootstrapping procedure, where a time-consuming optimization is replaced by a
sample averaging. Moreover, diagnostic tools based on the residual quantile
autocorrelation function are constructed to check the adequacy of the fitted
conditional quantiles. Simulation experiments are carried out to assess the
finite-sample performance of the proposed approach. The favorable performance
of the conditional quantile estimator and the usefulness of the inference tools
are further illustrated by an empirical application.

the 1 - 300s timescale. We analyse 675 M- and X-class flares observed by GOES
in 1-8\AA\ soft X-rays between 2011 February 1 and 2015 December 31.
Additionally, over the same era we analyse Fermi/GBM 15-25 keV X-ray data for
each of these flares that was associated with a Fermi/GBM solar flare trigger,
a total of 261 events. Using a model comparison method, we determine whether
there is evidence for a substantial enhancement in the Fourier power spectrum
that may be consistent with a QPP signature, based on three tested models; a
power-law plus a constant, a broken power-law plus constant, and a
power-law-plus-constant with an additional QPP signature component. From this,
we determine that ~30% of GOES events and ~8% of Fermi/GBM events show strong
signatures consistent with classical interpretations of QPP. For the remaining
events either two or more tested models cannot be strongly distinguished from
each other, or the events are well-described by single power-law or broken
power-law Fourier power spectra. For both instruments, a preferred
characteristic timescale of ~5-30 s was found in the QPP-like events, with no
dependence on flare magnitude in either GOES or GBM data. We also show that
individual events in the sample show similar characteristic timescales in both
GBM and GOES datasets. We discuss the implications of these results for our
understanding of solar flares and possible QPP mechanisms.

(ARF) in monitoring high-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) therapy. However,
ARF is dependent on tissue attenuation and sound speed, both of which are also
known to change with temperature making the therapy monitoring more
challenging. Furthermore, the viscoelastic properties of tissue are also
temperature dependent, which affects the displacements induced by ARF. The aim
of this study is to quantify the temperature dependent changes in the acoustic
and viscoelastic properties of liver and investigate their effect on ARF
induced displacements by using both experimental methods and simulations.
Furthermore, the temperature dependent viscoelastic properties of liver are
experimentally measured over a frequency range of 0.1-200 Hz at temperatures
reaching 80 C, and both conventional and fractional Zener models are used to
fit the data.
  The fractional Zener model was found to fit better with the experimental
viscoelasticity data with respect to the conventional model with up to two
magnitudes lower sum of squared errors (SSE). The characteristics of
experimental displacement data were also seen in the simulations due to the
changes in attenuation coefficient and lesion development. At low temperatures
before thermal ablation, attenuation was found to affect the displacement
amplitude. At higher temperature, the decrease in displacement amplitude occurs
approximately at 60-70 C due to the combined effect of viscoelasticity changes
and lesion growth overpowering the effect of attenuation. The results suggest
that it is necessary to monitor displacement continuously during HIFU therapy

transactional storage systems, particularly in wide area or geo-distributed
deployments. To reduce latency, systems typically rely on a cache to service
read-requests closer to the client. However, caches are not effective for
write-heavy workloads, which have to be processed by the storage system in
order to maintain serializability.
  This paper presents a new technique, called optimistic abort, which reduces
network latency for high-contention, write-heavy workloads by identifying
transactions that will abort as early as possible, and aborting them before
they reach the store. We have implemented optimistic abort in a system called
Gotthard, which leverages recent advances in network data plane programmability
to execute transaction processing logic directly in network devices. Gotthard
examines network traffic to observe and log transaction requests. If Gotthard
suspects that a transaction is likely to be aborted at the store, it aborts the
transaction early by re-writing the packet header, and routing the packets back
to the client. Gotthard significantly reduces the overall latency and improves
the throughput for high-contention workloads.

discuss the behaviors of the dynamically generated $S$-wave and $P$-wave

reconstruction of penetrable fractures, and (ii) quantitative identification of
their heterogeneous contact condition by seismic i.e. elastic waves. To this
end, the fracture support $\Gamma$ (which may be non-planar and unconnected) is
first recovered without prior knowledge of the interfacial condition by way of
the recently established approaches to non-iterative waveform tomography of
heterogeneous fractures, e.g. the methods of generalized linear sampling and
topological sensitivity. Given suitable approximation $\breve\Gamma$ of the
fracture geometry, the jump in the displacement field across $\breve\Gamma$
i.e. the fracture opening displacement (FOD) profile is computed from remote
sensory data via a regularized inversion of the boundary integral
representation mapping the FOD to remote observations of the scattered field.
Thus obtained FOD is then used as input for solving the traction boundary
integral equation on $\breve\Gamma$ for the unknown (linearized) contact
parameters. In this study, linear and possibly dissipative interactions between
the two faces of a fracture are parameterized in terms of a symmetric,
complex-valued matrix $\boldsymbol{K}(\boldsymbol{\xi})$ collecting the normal,
shear, and mixed-mode coefficients of specific stiffness. To facilitate the
high-fidelity inversion for $\boldsymbol{K}(\boldsymbol{\xi})$, a 3-step
regularization algorithm is devised to minimize the errors stemming from the
inexact geometric reconstruction and FOD recovery. The performance of the
inverse solution is illustrated by a set of numerical experiments where a
cylindrical fracture, endowed with two example patterns of specific stiffness
coefficients, is illuminated by plane waves and reconstructed in terms of its
geometry and heterogeneous (dissipative) contact condition.

select features by imposing sparsity-inducing regularizers. However, they do
not explicitly model how a dependent variable relies on features measured at
proximal time points. Recent graphical Granger modeling can select features in
lagged time points but ignores the temporal correlations within an individual's
repeated measurements. We propose an approach to automatically and
simultaneously determine both the relevant features and the relevant temporal
points that impact the current outcome of the dependent variable. Meanwhile,
the proposed model takes into account the non-{\em i.i.d} nature of the data by
estimating the within-individual correlations. This approach decomposes model
parameters into a summation of two components and imposes separate block-wise
LASSO penalties to each component when building a linear model in terms of the
past $\tau$ measurements of features. One component is used to select features
whereas the other is used to select temporal contingent points. An accelerated

is proved that Stage 1 and Stage 2 of the algorithm run in $O(n^{5+logn})$ and
$O(n^{3(5+logn)/2})$ time respectively, where $n$ is the order of input graph.
Because there is no theoretical proof yet that Stage 2 is applicable to all
graphs, further stages of the algorithm are proposed, which are in a general
form that is consistent with Stages 1 and 2.

vertical motions, commonly referred to as plumes. It is important to study the
mixing dynamics of a plume at a local scale in order to model their evolution
and growth. Such a characterization requires measuring the velocity and density
of the mixing fluids simultaneously. Here, we present the results of a buoyant
plume propagating in a linearly stratified medium with a density difference of
0.5%, thus yielding a buoyancy frequency of N=0.15 s^{-1}. To understand the
plume behaviour, statistics such as centerline and axial velocities along
varying downstream locations, turbulent kinetic energy, Reynolds stress, and
buoyancy flux were measured. The centerline velocity was found to decrease with
increase in height. The Reynolds stress and buoyancy flux profiles showed the
presence of a unstable layer and the mixing associated within that layer.

in a nonhomogeneously heated fluid annulus subjected to rotation along the
vertical axis (z). The nonhomogeneous heating was obtained by imposing radial
and vertical temperature gradient ({\Delta}T). The parameter range for this
study was Rayleigh number, Ra=2.43x10^8-3.66x10^8, and Taylor number,
Ta=6.45x10^8-27x10^8. The working fluid was water with a Prandtl number, Pr=7.
Heat transport was measured for varying rotation rates ({\Omega}) for fixed
values of {\Delta}T. The Nusselt number, Nu, plotted as a function of Ta
distinctly showed the effect of rotation on heat transport. In general, Nu was
found to have a larger value for non-rotating convection. This could mean an
interplay of columnar plumes and baroclinic wave in our system as also evident
from temperature measurements. Laser based imaging at a single vertical plane
also showed evidence of such flow structure.

  and flexible functional forms selection",,,,,"q-fin.EC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Road transport sector is found to be one of the major emitters, and
responsible for serious air pollution and huge pubic health losses. One
important parameter for determining the consequences of transport demand shocks
for the macroeconomy, air pollution and public health is the elasticity of the
demand for transport. Most published studies that use flexible functional forms
have ignored the theoretical regularity conditions implied by microeconomic
theories. Moreover, even a few studies have checked and/or imposed regularity
conditions, most of them equate curvature alone with regularity, thus ignoring
or minimizing the importance of other regularities. And then, the results
appear biased and may in fact be biased. Therefore, we select three of the most
widely used flexible functional forms, the Rotterdam model, the Almost Ideal
Demand System (AIDS), and the quadratic AIDS (QUAIDS) to investigate the demand
for road transport in China using recent annual expenditure data, over a 13
year period from 2002 to 2014, on three expenditure categories in the
transportation sector: private transportation, local transportation and
intercity transportation. Estimation shows that the AIDS model is the only
model that is able to provide theoretically consistent estimates of the
residents demand for road transport in China. Our estimates show that the
private transportation is a luxury among the transportation goods, and is
elastic in price changes relatively. The empirical results imply that the
private and the local transportation, the local and intercity transportation
are gross complements. And, the private transportation is a substitute for the
inter-city transportation, while the intercity transportation is a complement
of the private transportation.
