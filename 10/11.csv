models. Focusing on the case of Bose-Einstein condensates, and using a
meanfield approach to treat inter-particle collisions, we identify the origin
of dynamical instabilities arising due to the interplay between the external
drive and interactions. We present a widely-applicable generic numerical method
to extract instability rates, and link parametric instabilities to uncontrolled
energy absorption at short times. Based on the existence of parametric
resonances, we then develop an analytical approach within Bogoliubov theory,
which quantitatively captures the instability rates of the system, and provides
an intuitive picture of the relevant physical processes, including an
understanding of how transverse modes affect the formation of parametric
instabilities. Importantly, our calculations demonstrate an agreement between
the instability rates determined from numerical simulations, and those
predicted by theory. To determine the validity regime of the meanfield
analysis, we compare the latter to the weakly-coupled conserving approximation.
The tools developed and the results obtained in this work are directly relevant
to present-day ultracold-atom experiments based on shaken optical lattices, and
are expected to provide an insightful guidance in the quest for Floquet
engineering.

persistent probability current loops. The observable consequences of the latter
are explored. In particular, cyclic behavior of some form must be present: some
are prominent and manifest, while others are more obscure and subtle. We

the same way, enable us also to conduct a comparative study on this SN
sub-group. The results suggest that: a) the progenitors of faint SNe IIP are
slightly less massive and have less energetic explosions than those of
intermediate-luminosity SNe IIP, b) both faint and intermediate-luminosity SNe
IIP originate from low-energy explosions of red (or yellow) supergiant stars of
low-to-intermediate mass, c) some faint objects may also be explained as
electron-capture SNe from massive super-asymptotic giant branch stars, and d)

parameter ""guiding"" the distribution seems to be the ratio of the total
explosion energy to the ejected mass. Further hydrodynamical studies should be

functions of the regression parameters in high-dimensions is extremely
challenging -- especially without making restrictive or unverifiable

determining the optimal loads to be curtailed in a microgrid during
contingencies within a feasible time frame becomes computationally hard. This
paper proposes an efficient approximation algorithm for event-based demand
response management in microgrids. In event-based management, it is important
to curtail loads as fast as possible to maintain the stability of a microgrid
during the islanded mode in a scalable manner. A simple greedy approach is
presented that can rapidly determine a close-to-optimal load curtailment scheme
to maximize the aggregate customer utility in milliseconds for a large number
of customers. This paper further derives a novel theoretical guarantee of the
gap between the proposed efficient algorithm and the optimal solution (that may
be computationally hard to obtain). The performance of algorithm is
corroborated extensively by simulations with up to thousands of customers. For
the sake of practicality, the proposed event-based demand response management
algorithm is applied to a feeder from the Canadian benchmark distribution
system. The simulation results demonstrate that the proposed approach
efficiently optimizes microgrid operation during islanded mode while
maintaining appropriate voltage levels and network constrains.

ionized interstellar medium (ISM) and supersonic turbulence preferentially
located in the Galactic plane. Correspondingly, we consider the Galactic
distribution of electron density fluctuations consisting of not only a
Kolmogorov density spectrum but also a short-wave-dominated density spectrum
with the density structure formed at small scales due to shocks. The resulting
dependence of the scatter broadening time on the dispersion measure (DM)
naturally interprets the existing observational data for both low and high-DM
pulsars. According to the criteria that we derive for a quantitative
determination of scattering regimes over wide ranges of DMs and frequencies
$\nu$, we find that the pulsars with low DMs are primarily scattered by the
Kolmogorov turbulence, while those at low Galactic latitudes with high DMs
undergo more enhanced scattering dominated by the supersonic turbulence, where
the corresponding density spectrum has a spectral index $\approx 2.6$. Besides,
by considering a volume filling factor of the density structures with the
dependence on $\nu$ as $\propto \nu^{1.4}$ in the supersonic turbulence, our
model can also explain the observed shallower $\nu$ scaling of the scattering
time than the Kolmogorov scaling for the pulsars with relatively large DMs. The
comparison between our analytical results and the scattering measurements of
pulsars in turn makes a useful probe of the properties of the large-scale ISM
turbulence, e.g., an injection scale of $\sim 100$ pc, and also characteristics
of small-scale density structures.

relating to the interface-induced perpendicular magnetic anisotropy (PMA) were
investigated using scanning transmission electron microscopy, energy dispersive
x-ray spectroscopy, and x-ray magnetic circular dichroism. We found that Al
atoms from the Co2FeAl layer significantly interdiffuse into MgO, forming an
Al-deficient Co-Fe-Al/Mg-Al-O structure near the Co2FeAl/MgO interface. This
atomic replacement may play an additional role for enhancing PMA, which is
consistent with the observed large perpendicular orbital magnetic moments of Fe
atoms at the interface. This work suggests that control of interdiffusion at

suggests that the difficulty of refuting CSP$(P)$ using an SDP is determined by
a parameter $\mathrm{cmplx}(P)$, the smallest $t$ for which there does not

effects because they are present in only a very small fraction of stars within
a narrow spectral range and because signal to noise ratio considerations
predict that the signal should mostly be detected in the brightest objects,
while this is not the case. We consider several possibilities, such as
rotational transitions in molecules, rapid pulsations, Fourier transform of
spectral lines and signals generated by Extraterrestrial Intelligence (ETI).
They cannot be generated by molecules or rapid pulsations. It is highly
unlikely that they come from the Fourier transform of spectral lines because
too many strong lines located at nearly periodic frequencies are needed.
Finally we consider the possibility, predicted in a previous published paper,
that the signals are caused by light pulses generated by Extraterrestrial
Intelligence to makes us aware of their existence. We find that the detected
signals have exactly the shape of an ETI signal predicted in the previous
publication and are therefore in agreement with this hypothesis. The fact that
they are only found in a very small fraction of stars within a narrow spectral
range centered near the spectral type of the sun is also in agreement with the
ETI hypothesis. However, at this stage, this hypothesis needs to be confirmed

of the scalar manifold and the $U(1)_R$ gauging of the $R$-symmetry. Analyzing
the gaugino conditions we show that when the fermionic shifts do not vanish
there are no supersymmetric Bianchi attractors. This is analogous to the known
condition that for maximally supersymmetric solutions, all the fermionic shifts
must vanish. When the central charge satisfies an extremization condition, some
of the fermionic shifts vanish and supersymmetry requires that the symmetries
of the scalar manifold do not be gauged. This allows supersymmetric Bianchi
attractors sourced by massless gauge fields and a cosmological constant. In
five dimensions in the Bianchi I class we show that the anisotropic

develop accelerated iterative Hessian sketch via the searching the conjugate

approach on the dual problem, which leads to the accelerated iterative dual

iteratively sketches the primal and dual formulations. We show that using a

synthetic and real data sets which complements our theoretical results.

Complete dry processing was adopted for the fabrication of these

intrinsic thermal neutron detection efficiency values of 0.86%, 2.4%, 3.15%,

star-forming galaxy at z~1.4 by fitting a simple analytic model for the
chemical evolution in a galaxy to the observational data of the stellar mass,
metallicity, and molecular gas mass fraction. The molecular gas mass is derived
from CO observations with a metallicity-dependent CO-to-H2 conversion factor,
and the gas metallicity is derived from the H{\alpha} and [NII]{\lambda} 6584
emission line ratio. Using a stacking analysis of CO integrated intensity maps
and the emission lines of H{\alpha} and [NII], the relation between stellar
mass, metallicity, and gas mass fraction is derived. We constrain the inflow
and outflow rates with least-chi-square fitting of a simple analytic chemical
evolution model to the observational data. The best-fit inflow and outflow
rates are ~1.7 and ~0.4 in units of star-formation rate, respectively. The
inflow rate is roughly comparable to the sum of the star-formation rate and
outflow rate, which supports the equilibrium model for galaxy evolution; i.e.,
all inflow gas is consumed by star formation and outflow.

important role as a calibration benchmark for stellar evolution theory due to
its near solar composition and age. As a result, it has been observed
extensively, including attempts to detect solar-like oscillations in its main
sequence and red giant stars. However, any asteroseismic inference has so far
remained elusive due to the difficulty in measuring these extremely low
amplitude oscillations. Here we report the first unambiguous detection of
solar-like oscillations in the red giants of M67. We use data from the Kepler
ecliptic mission, K2, to measure the global asteroseismic properties. We find a
model-independent seismic-informed distance of 816+/-11pc, or
(m-M)o=9.57+/-0.03mag, an average red-giant mass of 1.36+/-0.01Msun, in
agreement with the dynamical mass from an eclipsing binary near the cluster
turn-off, and ages of individual stars compatible with isochrone fitting. We
see no evidence of strong mass loss on the red giant branch. We also determine
seismic log g of all the cluster giants with a typical precision of ~0.01dex.
Our results generally show good agreement with independent methods and support
the use of seismic scaling relations to determine global properties of red
giant stars with near solar metallicity. We further illustrate that the data
are of such high quality, that future work on individual mode frequencies
should be possible, which would extend the scope of seismic analysis of this

mechanism for the dark fields is not typically specified. We demonstrate that
the dark matter interaction types, and hence the annihilation processes
relevant for relic density and indirect detection, are strongly dictated by the
mass generation mechanism chosen for the dark sector particles, and the
requirement of gauge invariance. We focus on the class of models in which
fermionic dark matter couples to a spin-1 vector or axial-vector mediator.
However, in order to generate dark sector mass terms, it is necessary in most
cases to introduce a dark Higgs field and thus a spin-0 scalar mediator will
also be present. In the case that all the dark sector fields gain masses via
coupling to a single dark sector Higgs field, it is mandatory that the
axial-vector coupling of the spin-1 mediator to the dark matter is non-zero;
the vector coupling may also be present depending on the charge assignments.
For all other mass generation options, only pure vector couplings between the
spin-1 mediator and the dark matter are allowed. If these coupling restrictions
are not obeyed, unphysical results may be obtained such as a violation of
unitarity at high energies. These two-mediator scenarios lead to important
phenomenology that does not arise in single mediator models. We survey
two-mediator dark matter models which contain both vector and scalar mediators,
and explore their relic density and indirect detection phenomenology.

determining the properties of gravitation. We begin by examining two different
classes of interacting theories of massless spin 2 particles -- gravitons. One
involves coupling the graviton with the lowest number of derivatives to matter,
the other involves coupling the graviton with higher derivatives to matter,
making use of the linearized Riemann tensor. The first class requires an
infinite tower of terms for consistency, which is known to lead uniquely to
general relativity. The second class only requires a finite number of terms for
consistency, which appears as another class of theories of massless spin 2. We
recap the causal consistency of general relativity and show how this fails in
the second class for the special case of coupling to photons, exploiting
related calculations in the literature. In a companion paper [1] this result is
generalized to a much broader set of theories. Then, as a causal modification
of general relativity, we add light scalar particles and recap the generic
violation of universal free-fall they introduce and its quantum resolution.
This leads to a discussion of a special type of scalar-tensor theory; the
$F(\mathcal{R})$ models. We show that, unlike general relativity, these models
do not possess the requisite counterterms to be consistent quantum effective
field theories. Together this helps to remove some of the central assumptions
made in deriving general relativity.

pressure floor, star formation, supernova feedback energy, and metal production
are carefully constrained across code platforms. With numerical accuracy that
resolves the disk scale height, we find that the codes overall agree well with
one another in many dimensions including: gas and stellar surface densities,
rotation curves, velocity dispersions, density and temperature distribution
functions, disk vertical heights, stellar clumps, star formation rates, and
Kennicutt-Schmidt relations. Quantities such as velocity dispersions are very
robust (agreement within a few tens of percent at all radii) while measures
like newly-formed stellar clump mass functions show more significant variation
(difference by up to a factor of ~3). Systematic differences exist, for
example, between mesh-based and particle-based codes in the low density region,
and between more diffusive and less diffusive schemes in the high density tail
of the density distribution. Yet intrinsic code differences are generally small
compared to the variations in numerical implementations of the common subgrid
physics such as supernova feedback. Our experiment reassures that, if
adequately designed in accordance with our proposed common parameters, results
of a modern high-resolution galaxy formation simulation are more sensitive to
input physics than to intrinsic differences in numerical schemes.

approach than using any one method alone. We combine the Galaxy Zoo

by focusing on the evolution of the baryon number and magnetic field through
the Standard Model electroweak crossover. The baryon asymmetry is determined by
a competition between the helical hypermagnetic field, which sources baryon
number, and the electroweak sphaleron, which tends to wash out baryon number.
At the electroweak crossover both of these processes become inactive; the
hypermagnetic field is converted into an electromagnetic field, which does not
source baryon number, and the weak gauge boson masses grow, suppressing the
electroweak sphaleron reaction. An accurate prediction of the relic baryon
asymmetry requires a careful treatment of the crossover. We extend our previous
study [K. Kamada and A. J. Long, Phys. Rev. D94, 065301 (2016),
arXiv:1606.08891[astro-ph.CO]], taking into account the gradual conversion of
the hypermagnetic into the electromagnetic field. If the conversion is not
completed by the time of sphaleron freeze-out, as both analytic and numerical
studies suggest, the relic baryon asymmetry is enhanced compared to previous
calculations. The observed baryon asymmetry of the Universe can be obtained for
a primordial magnetic field that has a present-day field strength and coherence
length of $B_0 \sim 10^{-17} \, {\rm G}$ and $\lambda_0 \sim 10^{-3} \, {\rm
pc}$ and a positive helicity. For larger $B_0$ the baryon asymmetry is
overproduced, which may be in conflict with blazar observations that provide
evidence for an intergalactic magnetic field of strength $B_0 \gtrsim
10^{-14\sim16} \, {\rm G}$.

kinematic structure of 25 galaxies at $0.7 \lesssim z \lesssim 2.3$, in four
cluster fields, with stellar masses $8 \lesssim \log{(M_\star/M_\odot)}

than in any previous kinematic IFU surveys. Our sample displays a diversity in
kinematic structure over this mass and redshift range. The majority of our
kinematically resolved sample is rotationally supported, but with a lower ratio
of rotational velocity to velocity dispersion than in the local universe,
indicating the fraction of dynamically hot disks changes with cosmic time. We
find no galaxies with stellar mass $<3 \times 10^9 M_\odot$ in our sample
display regular ordered rotation. Using the enhanced spatial resolution from
lensing, we resolve a lower number of dispersion dominated systems compared to
field surveys, competitive with findings from surveys using adaptive optics. We
find that the KMOS IFUs recover emission line flux from HST grism-selected
objects more faithfully than slit spectrographs. With artificial slits we
estimate slit spectrographs miss on average 60% of the total flux of emission
lines, which decreases rapidly if the emission line is spatially offset from

  Aims. We aim to investigate the origin of the X-ray variation by
investigating the response of the mid-infrared environment.
  Methods. We obtained single-aperture and interferometric mid-infrared
measurements and directly compared the measurements observed before and
immediately after the X-ray variations. The average correlated and
single-aperture fluxes as well as the differential phases were directly
compared to detect a possible change in the structure of the nuclear emission
on scales of $\sim$ 2 pc.
  Results. The flux densities and differential phases of the observations
before and during the X-ray variation show no significant change over a period
of ten years. Possible minor variations in the infrared emission are $\lesssim$
8 %.
  Conclusions. Our results suggest that the mid-infrared environment of NGC
1068 has remained unchanged for a decade. The recent transient change in the
X-rays did not cause a significant variation in the infrared emission. This
independent study supports previous conclusions that stated that the X-ray
variation detected by NuSTAR observations is due to X-ray emission piercing
through a patchy section of the dusty region.

formation of thin, coherently rotating planes of satellites such as those seen
around the Milky Way and Andromeda. For four Milky Way-mass simulations, each
run both as dark matter-only and with baryons included, we are able to identify
a planar configuration that significantly maximizes the number of plane
satellite members. The maximum plane member satellites are consistently
different between the dark matter-only and baryonic versions of the same run
due to the fact that satellites are both more likely to be destroyed and to
infall later in the baryonic runs. Hence, studying satellite planes in dark
matter-only simulations is misleading, because they will be composed of
different satellite members than those that would exist if baryons were
included. Additionally, the destruction of satellites in the baryonic runs
leads to less radially concentrated satellite distributions, a result that is
critical to making planes that are statistically significant compared to a
random distribution. Since all planes pass through the centre of the galaxy, it
is much harder to create a plane from a random distribution if the satellites
have a low radial concentration. We identify Andromeda's low radial satellite
concentration as a key reason why the plane in Andromeda is highly significant.
Despite this, when co-rotation is considered, none of the satellite planes
identified for the simulated galaxies are as statistically significant as the
observed planes around the Milky Way and Andromeda, even in the baryonic runs.

photoionisation codes, and compare their derived thermal and ionisation states
for various ionising spectral energy distributions. We examine the resulting
absorption-line spectra from these codes for the case of ionised outflows in
active galactic nuclei. By comparing the ionic abundances as a function of
ionisation parameter $\xi$, we find that on average there is about 30%
deviation between the codes in $\xi$ where ionic abundances peak. For H-like to
B-like sequence ions alone, this deviation in $\xi$ is smaller at about 10% on
average. The comparison of the absorption-line spectra in the X-ray band shows
that there is on average about 30% deviation between the codes in the optical
depth of the lines produced at log $\xi$ ~ 1 to 2, reducing to about 20%

results highlight the importance of continuous development and enhancement of

with automatic repeat-request (ARQ) and a half duplex decode-and-forward shared
relay. In this system, two multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) base stations
serve two single antenna users. A MIMO shared relay retransmits the lost
packets to the target users. First, we study the system with direct
retransmission from the base station and derive a closed form expression for
the outage probability of the system.We show that the direct retransmission can
overcome the fading, however, it cannot overcome the interference. After that,
we invoke the shared relay and design the relay beamforming matrices such that
the signal-to-interference-and-noise ratio (SINR) is improved at the users
subject to power constraints on the relay. In the case when the transmission of
only one user fails, we derive a closed form solution for the relay
beamformers. On the other hand when both transmissions fail, we pose the
beamforming problem as a sequence of non-convex feasibility problems. We use
semidefinite relaxation (SDR) to convert each feasibility problem into a convex
optimization problem. We ensure a rank one solution, and hence, there is no
loss of optimality in SDR. Simulation results are presented showing the
superior performance of the proposed relay beamforming strategy compared to
direct ARQ system in terms of the outage probability.

transformations of data that best align with specified pairwise similarity and

algorithms due to the better adapted distance or similarity measures. Here, we
address the problem of learning these transformations when the underlying

to changes in either the ground-truth clustering used to generate constraints
or changes in the feature subspaces in which the class structure is apparent.
We propose Online Convex Ensemble StrongLy Adaptive Dynamic Learning (OCELAD),
a general adaptive, online approach for learning and tracking optimal metrics
as they change over time that is highly robust to a variety of nonstationary
behaviors in the changing metric. We apply the OCELAD framework to an ensemble
of online learners. Specifically, we create a retro-initialized composite

superbubbles (SBs), driven by multiple supernovae (SNe), that propagate into

range of mean background densities n_avg=0.1-10 cm^{-3} and intervals between
SNe dt_sn=0.01-1 Myr, and follow each SB until the radius reaches (1-2)H, where
H is the characteristic ISM disk thickness. Except for embedded dense clouds,
each SB is hot until a time t_sf,m when the shocked warm gas at the outer front
cools and forms an overdense shell. Subsequently, diffuse gas in the SB
interior remains at T_h 10^6-10^7K with expansion velocity v_h~10^2-10^3km/s
(both highest for low dt_sn). At late times, the warm shell gas velocities are
several 10's to ~100km/s. While shell velocities are too low to escape from a
massive galaxy, they are high enough to remove substantial mass from dwarfs.
Dense clouds are also accelerated, reaching a few to 10's of km/s. We measure
the mass in hot gas per SN, M_h/N_SN, and the total radial momentum of the
bubble per SN, p_b/N_SN. After t_sf,m, M_h/N_SN 10-100M_sun (highest for low
n_avg), while p_b/N_SN 0.7-3x10^5M_sun km/s (highest for high dt_sn). If
galactic winds in massive galaxies are loaded by the hot gas in SBs, we
conclude that the mass-loss rates would generally be lower than star formation
rates. Only if the SN cadence is much higher than typical in galactic disks, as
may occur for nuclear starbursts, SBs can break out while hot and expel up to
10 times the mass locked up in stars. The momentum injection values, p_b/N_SN,
are consistent with requirements to control star formation rates in galaxies at
observed levels.

the Lieb theorem, the inclusion of long range interaction -or odd number of

field experienced by Milky Way clusters is significantly weaker in the past

the liquid outer core. Geodynamo simulations have been successful in
reproducing many observed properties of the geomagnetic field. However, while
theoretical considerations suggest that flow in the core is governed by a
balance between Lorentz force, rotational force and buoyancy (called MAC
balance for Magnetic, Archimedean, Coriolis) with only minute roles for viscous
and inertial forces, dynamo simulations must employ viscosity values that are
many orders of magnitude larger than in the core due to computational
constraints. In typical geodynamo models viscous and inertial forces are not
much smaller than the Coriolis force and the Lorentz force plays a sub-dominant
role. This has led to conclusions that these simulations are viscously
controlled and do not represent the physics of the geodynamo. Here we show by a
direct analysis of the relevant forces that a MAC balance can be achieved when
the viscosity is reduced to values close to the current practical limit.
Lorentz force, buoyancy and the uncompensated (by pressure) part of the
Coriolis force are of very similar strength, whereas viscous and inertia are
smaller by a factor of at least 20 in the bulk of the fluid volume. Compared to
non-magnetic convection at otherwise identical parameters, the dynamo flow is
of larger scale, less invariant parallel to the rotation axis (less
geostrophic) and convection transports twice as much heat, all of which is
expected when the Lorentz force strongly influences the convection properties.

a nontrivial gap when the functional is minimized on spaces $W^{1,1}$ and
$W^{1,\infty}$. To remedy the standard finite element method, which fails to
converge for such variational problems, a simple and effective cut-off
procedure is utilized to design the (enhanced finite element) discrete energy

phenomenon by capping the derivatives of its input on a scale of
$O(h^{-\alpha})$ (where $h$ denotes the mesh size) for some positive constant
$\alpha$. A sufficient condition is proposed for determining the
problem-dependent parameter $\a$. Extensive 1-D and 2-D numerical experiment

truncated posterior distributions. Truncated distributions are proportional to
exact posteriors within subsets of a discrete state space and equal zero
otherwise. The treatment of the distributions' subsets as variational
parameters distinguishes the approach from previous variational approaches. The
specific structure of truncated distributions allows for deriving novel and
mathematically grounded results, which in turn can be used to formulate novel
efficient algorithms to optimize the parameters of probabilistic generative
models. Most centrally, we find the variational lower bounds that correspond to
truncated distributions to be given by very concise and efficiently computable
expressions, while update equations for model parameters remain in their
standard form. Based on these findings, we show how efficient and easily
applicable meta-algorithms can be formulated that guarantee a monotonic
increase of the variational bound. Example applications of the here derived
framework provide novel theoretical results and learning procedures for latent
variable models as well as mixture models. Furthermore, we show that truncated
variation EM naturally interpolates between standard EM with full posteriors
and EM based on the maximum a-posteriori state (MAP). The approach can,
therefore, be regarded as a generalization of the popular `hard EM' approach
towards a similarly efficient method which can capture more of the true

surface measures of close parallel sets. Such measure relations had been
observed before for self-similar sets and some self-conformal sets in

even the case of unbounded sets.

symbols arrive one-by-one and we do not have random access to the input. While
computing the answer exactly using sublinear space is not possible in such a
setting, one can still hope for a good approximation guarantee. Our
contribution is twofold. First, we provide lower bounds on the space
requirements for randomized approximation algorithms processing inputs of
length $n$. We rule out Las Vegas algorithms, as they cannot achieve sublinear
space complexity. For Monte Carlo algorithms, we prove a lower bounds of
$\Omega( M \log\min\{|\Sigma|,M\})$ bits of memory; here $M=n/E$ for
approximating the answer with additive error $E$, and $M= \frac{\log n}{\log
(1+\varepsilon)}$ for approximating the answer with multiplicative error $(1 +
\varepsilon)$. Second, we design three real-time algorithms for this problem.
Our Monte Carlo approximation algorithms for both additive and multiplicative
versions of the problem use $O(M)$ words of memory. Thus the obtained lower
bounds are asymptotically tight up to a logarithmic factor. The third algorithm
is deterministic and finds a longest palindrome exactly if it is short. This
algorithm can be run in parallel with a Monte Carlo algorithm to obtain better
results in practice. Overall, both the time and space complexity of finding a
longest palindrome in a stream are essentially settled.

Si $2p$ orbitals can be assigned from previously reported ones where asymmetric
pseudo-Voigt functions are adopted. Theoretically, we have adopted an approach
developed very recently, which follows the sophisticated $\Delta$
self-consistent field ($\Delta$SCF) methods, to study the single-particle
excitation of core states. In the calculations, each single-particle energy and
the renormalized core-hole charge density are calculated straightforwardly via
two SCF calculations. By comparing the results, the theoretical core-level
absolute binding energies including the splitting due to spin-orbit coupling
are in good agreement with the observed high-resolution XPS spectra. The good
agreement not only resolves the puzzling discrepancy between experiment and
theory (DOS) but also advocates the success of DFT in describing many-body
interactions of electrons at the surface.

coronal (or X-ray) jets, are among the most interesting manifestations of solar
activity. It has been suggested that these events contribute to the mass and
energy content of the corona and solar wind, but the extent of these
contributions remains uncertain. We have recently modeled the formation and
evolution of coronal jets using a three-dimensional (3D) magnetohydrodynamic
(MHD) code with thermodynamics in a large spherical domain that includes the
solar wind. Our model is coupled to 3D MHD flux-emergence simulations, i.e, we
use boundary conditions provided by such simulations to drive a time-dependent
coronal evolution. The model includes parametric coronal heating, radiative
losses, and thermal conduction, which enables us to simulate the dynamics and
plasma properties of coronal jets in a more realistic manner than done so far.
Here we employ these simulations to calculate the amount of mass and energy
transported by coronal jets into the outer corona and inner heliosphere. Based
on observed jet-occurrence rates, we then estimate the total contribution of
coronal jets to the mass and energy content of the solar wind to (0.4-3.0) %
and (0.3-1.0) %, respectively. Our results are largely consistent with the few
previous rough estimates obtained from observations, supporting the conjecture
that coronal jets provide only a small amount of mass and energy to the solar
wind. We emphasize, however, that more advanced observations and simulations
are needed to substantiate this conjecture.

harmonic frames - vector sets defined in terms of the characters of finite

  This work is dedicated to the study of the underlying combinatorial

with certain Gauss summing properties - all three of which are generalizations
of difference sets that fall under the umbrella term ""bidifference set"" - then
it is either a BTF or an ETF. However, we also show that the relationship
between harmonic BTFs and bidifference sets is not as straightforward as the
correspondence between harmonic ETFs and difference sets, as there are examples
of bidifference sets that do not generate harmonic BTFs. In addition, we study
another class of combinatorial structures, the nested divisible difference
sets, which yields an example of a harmonic BTF that is not generated by a
bidifference set.

no loss of boundary conditions occurs in spite of gradient blowup. Actually, we

parameterized by a collection of the identifiers V (variable names). This paper
introduces the skeletal program enumeration (SPE) problem: Given a fixed
syntactic skeleton P and a set of variables V , enumerate a set of programs P
exhibiting all possible variable usage patterns within P. It proposes an
effective realization of SPE for systematic, rigorous compiler testing by
leveraging three important observations: (1) Programs with different variable
usage patterns exhibit diverse control- and data-dependence information, and
help exploit different compiler optimizations and stress-test compilers; (2)
most real compiler bugs were revealed by small tests (i.e., small-sized P) ---
this ""small-scope"" observation opens up SPE for practical compiler validation;
and (3) SPE is exhaustive w.r.t. a given syntactic skeleton and variable set,
and thus can offer a level of guarantee that is absent from all existing
compiler testing techniques.
  The key challenge of SPE is how to eliminate the enormous amount of
equivalent programs w.r.t. $\alpha$-conversion. Our main technical contribution
is a novel algorithm for computing the canonical (and smallest) set of all
non-$\alpha$-equivalent programs. We have realized our SPE technique and
evaluated it using syntactic skeletons derived from GCC's testsuite. Our
evaluation results on testing GCC and Clang are extremely promising. In less
than six months, our approach has led to 217 confirmed bug reports, 104 of
which have already been fixed, and the majority are long latent bugs despite
the extensive prior efforts of automatically testing both compilers (e.g.,
Csmith and EMI). The results also show that our algorithm for enumerating
non-$\alpha$-equivalent programs provides six orders of magnitude reduction,
enabling processing the GCC test-suite in under a month.

1978K at both 34 GHz and 94 GHz, making it only the third extragalactic
supernova (after SN 1987A and SN 1996cr) to be detected at late-times at these
frequencies. We find SN 1978K to be >400 times more luminous than SN 1987A at
millimetre wavelengths in spite of the roughly nine year difference in ages,
highlighting the risk in adopting SN 1987A as a template for the evolution of
core-collapse supernovae in general. Additionally, from new VLBI observations
at 8.4 GHz, we measure a deconvolved diameter for SN 1978K of ~5 milli-arcsec,
and a corresponding average expansion velocity of <1500 km/s. These
observations provide independent evidence of an extremely dense circumstellar
medium surrounding the progenitor star.

algorithm to perform real-time facial motion capture of an actor who is wearing
a head-mounted display (HMD), as well as a new data-driven approach for eye
tracking from monocular videos. Based on reenactment of a prerecorded stereo
video of the person without the HMD, FaceVR incorporates photo-realistic

algebraic multigrid (AMG). Algebraic multigrid is a popular and effective
iterative method for solving large, sparse linear systems that arise from
discretizing partial differential equations. However, while AMG is designed for
symmetric positive definite matrices (SPD), certain SPD problems, such as
anisotropic diffusion, are still not adequately addressed by existing methods.
Non-SPD problems pose an even greater challenge, and in practice AMG is often
not considered as a solver for such problems.
  The focus of this paper is on so-called root-node AMG, which can be viewed as
a combination of classical and aggregation-based multigrid. An algorithm for
root-node is outlined and a filtering strategy is developed, which is able to
control the cost of using root-node AMG, particularly on difficult problems.
New theoretical motivation is provided for root-node and energy-minimization as
applied to symmetric as well non-symmetric systems. Numerical results are then
presented demonstrating the robust ability of root-node to solve non-symmetric
problems, systems-based problems, and difficult SPD problems, including
strongly anisotropic diffusion, convection-diffusion, and upwind steady-state
transport, in a scalable manner. New, detailed estimates of the computational
cost of the setup and solve phase are given for each example, providing
additional support for root-node AMG over alternative methods.

augmentation schemes are widely used when deep networks suffer the insufficient

stronger than that of electrons. This makes the hole systems very attractive
for possible spintronics applications. In three dimensions (3D) dynamics of
holes is described by well known Luttinger Hamiltonian. However, most of recent
spintronics applications are related to two dimensional heterostructures where
dynamics in one direction is frozen due to quantum confinement. The confinement
results in dimensional reduction of the Luttinger Hamiltonian, 3D ->2D. Due to
interplay of the spin-orbit interaction, the external magnetic field, and the
lateral gate potential imposed on the heterostructure the reduction is highly
nontrivial and not known. In the present work we perform the reduction and
hence derive the general effective Hamiltonian which describes spintronics
effects in symmetric two-dimensional (2D) heterostructures. In particular, we

self-energy, in terms of the quasi-gluons and quasi- quark/anti-quarks with
respective effective fugacities, the dissociation process of heavy quarkonium
in hot QCD medium has been investigated. This has been done by investigating
the medium modification to a heavy quark potential. The medium modified
potential has a quite different form (a long range Coulomb tail in addition to
the usual Yukawa term) in contrast to the usual picture of Debye screening. The
flavor dependence of the binding energies of the heavy quarkonia states and the
dissociation temperature have been obtained by employing the debye mass for
pure gluonic and full QCD case computed employing the quasi-particle picture.
Thus estimated dissociation patterns of the charmonium and bottomonium states,

hopping in a cubic lattice subject to a Weyl type spin-orbit coupling (SOC). As
one tunes the SOC parameter at the half filling, the system displays Weyl
fermions and also various TPT due to the collision of particle-particle or
hole-hole Weyl Fermi Surface (WFS). At the zero temperature, the TPT is found
to be a third order one whose critical exponent is determined. We derive the
scaling functions of the specific heat, compressibility and magnetic
susceptibilities. In contrast to all the previous cases in quantum or
topological transitions, although the leading terms are non-universal and
cutoff dependent, the sub-leading terms satisfy universal scaling relations.
The sub-leading scaling leads to the topological depletions (TD) which show
non-analytic and non-Fermi liquid corrections in the quantum critical regime,
can be easily distinguished from the analytic leading terms and detected
experimentally. One can also form a topological Wilson ratio from the TD of two
conserved quantities such as the specific heat and the compressibility. As a
byproduct, we also find Type II Weyl fermions appearing as the TPT due to the
collision of the extended particle-hole WFS. Experimental realizations and
detections in cold atom systems and materials with SOC are discussed.

known to induce fractional fermion number. I present an example where an

string stable nor is the fermion number conserved, yet the bound state then
becomes stable due to Quantum Mechanics. The other phenomenon concerns a
metastable vacuum getting destabilised due to the presence of a cosmic string.
This happens because the scalar field signalling spontaneous symmetry breaking
acquires a vacuum expectation value approaching its true vacuum value in the
core of the string. Thus the string acts like a seed nucleating the true
vacuum. The instanton mediating between the false vacuum and the exit point
into the true vacuum is shown to exist and graphically displayed through a

of these machines, but unfortunately has generally not provided details of the

domains power dissipation and switching speed. Materials with certain high
carrier mobility, equally, unveil rich unusual physical phenomena elusive in
their conventional counterparts. As a consequence, the methods to enhance the
carrier mobility of materials receive immense research interests due to their
potential applications in more effective electronic devices and enrichment of
more unusual phenomena. For instance, introducing a flat hexagonal boron
nitride (h-BN) substrate to enhance the carrier mobility has been achieved
experimentally. However, the underlying mechanics is not well understood. In
this study, we estimate the carrier mobility of phosphorene on h-BN substrate
(P/h-BN) within the framework of the phonon-limited scattering model at
first-principles level. %Our results are generic. Besides high-$\kappa$
dielectric property, h-BN also possesses excellent mechanical property of a
high two-dimensional elastic modulus. The P/h-BN heterostructure inherits the
high elastic modulus of h-BN, leading to an enhanced carrier mobility in
phosphorene. Owing to the weak van der Waals interactions between the layers,
the unique electronic properties of phosphorene are almost perfectly preserved
near the Fermi level, guaranteeing the superior electronic transport in P/h-BN.
Our findings offer a new perspective to improve the carrier mobility in
phosphorene as well as other 2D materials based field effect transistors.

nonlinearity and multidisciplinary nature. Many of the numerical methods for

to develop a method that guarantees both convergence and stability.
  Our discussion in this work is restricted to the interaction of viscous
incompressible fluid flow and a rigid body. We take the monolithic approach by
Gibou and Min that results in an extended Hodge projection. The projection
updates not only the fluid vector field but also the solid velocities. We
derive the equivalence of the extended Hodge projection to the Poisson equation
with non-local Robin boundary condition. We prove the existence, uniqueness,
and regularity for the weak solution of the Poisson equation, through which the
Hodge projection is shown to be unique and orthogonal. Also, we show the
stability of the projection in a sense that the projection does not increase
the total kinetic energy of fluid and solid. Also, we discusse a numerical
method as a discrete analogue to the Hodge projection, then we show that the
unique decomposition and orthogonality also hold in the discrete setting. As
one of our main results, we prove that the numerical solution is convergent
with at least the first order accuracy. We carry out numerical experiments in

systems arising from the edge element discretization of the time-harmonic
Maxwell equations in three dimensions. We will first consider the saddle-point
systems with vanishing wave number, for which we present an important relation
between the solutions of the singular curl-curl system and the non-singular
saddle-point system, then demonstrate that the saddle-point system can be
efficiently solved by the Hiptmair-Xu solver. For the saddle-point systems with
non-vanishing wave numbers, we will show that the PCG with a new preconditioner
can apply for the non-singular system when wave numbers are small, while the
methods like preconditioned MINRES may apply for some existing and new
preconditioners when wave numbers are large. The spectral behaviors of the
resulting preconditioned systems for the existing and new preconditioners are
analyzed and compared, and numerical experiments are presented to demonstrate
and compare the efficiencies of these preconditioners.

parsimony optimization is the most commonly employed approach. In the past and
present application of the parsimony principle, extra step numbers have been
added across different characters without proper justification. This practice,
however, has caused the impacts of characters to be inflated or deflated
without a valid reason. To resolve this methodological deficiency, here I
present a corrected parsimony criterion for reconstructing phylogenies. In
essence, character rather than step is the most fundamental unit. Accordingly,
the most parsimonious tree should maximize the sum or average of the
phylogenetic signals, quantified by retention index, contributed by each
character. Assigning proper weights to characters is a separate task that
requires information other than the intra-character step number changing range.

confined electron systems generated at the bare surfaces of transition metal
oxides (TMOs). This scientific field is a prime example of a domain where
two-dimensional physics and photoemission-based spectroscopic techniques have
together set up the development of the story. The discovery of a high-mobility
two-dimensional electron system (2DES) at interfaces of transition metal oxides
has attracted an immense scientific interest due to new opportunities opened in
the emerging field of oxide electronics. The subsequent paradigm shift from
interfaces to the bare surfaces of TMOs made the confined electron system
accessible to surface-sensitive spectroscopic techniques and this new era is
the focus of the present article. We describe how results by means of
Angle-Resolved Photoemission Spectroscopy (ARPES) establish the presence of
confined electron carriers at the bare surface of SrTiO$_{3}$(100), which
exhibit complex physics phenomena such as orbital ordering, electron-phonon
interactions and spin splitting. The key element behind the 2DES generation is
oxygen vacancies. Moreover, we review the experimental evidence on the
generation of 2DESs on surfaces with different orientation, as well as on
different TMO substrates. The electronic structure of the confined electron
system responds to such changes, thereby providing external means for
engineering its properties. Finally, we identify new directions for future
research by introducing a device-friendly fabrication protocol for the
generation of 2DESs on TMO surfaces.

occurrence of solar flares is highly dependent on the structure and the
topology of solar magnetic fields. A new method for predicting large (M and X
class) flares is presented, which uses machine learning methods applied to the
Zernike moments of magnetograms observed by the Helioseismic and Magnetic
Imager (HMI) onboard the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO) for a period of six
years from 2 June 2010 to 1 August 2016. Magnetic field images consisting of
the radial component of the magnetic field are converted to finite sets of
Zernike moments and fed to the Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier. Zernike
moments have the capability to elicit unique features from any 2-D image, which
may allow more accurate classification. The results indicate whether an
arbitrary active region has the potential to produce at least one large flare.
We show that the majority of large flares can be predicted within 48 hours
before their occurrence, with only 10 false negatives out of 385 flaring active
region magnetograms, and 21 false positives out of 179 non-flaring active
region magnetograms. Our method may provide a useful tool for prediction of
solar flares which can be employed alongside other forecasting methods.

restricted velocity distribution functions (VDFs) at the edges of a cloud of
protons injected into non-uniform distributions of the electromagnetic field.
The velocity distribution function is reconstructed using the forward
test-kinetic method. We consider two profiles of the electric field: (1) a
non-uniform E-field obtained by solving the Laplace equation consistent with
the conservation of the electric drift and (2) a constant and uniform E-field.
In both cases, the magnetic field is similar to the solutions obtained for
tangential discontinuities. The initial velocity distribution function is
Liouville mapped along numerically integrated trajectories. The numerical
results show the formation of an energy-dispersed structure due to the
energy-dependent displacement of protons towards the edges of the cloud by the
gradient-B drift. Another direct effect of the gradient-B drift is the
formation of ring-shaped velocity distribution functions within the
velocity-dispersed structure. Higher energy particles populate the edges of the
proton beam, while smaller energies are located in the core. Non-gyrotropic
velocity distribution functions form on the front-side and trailing edge of the
cloud; this effect is due to remote sensing of energetic particles with guiding
centers inside the beam. The kinetic features revealed by the test-kinetic
solutions have features similar to in-situ velocity distribution functions
observed by Cluster satellites in the magnetotail, close to the neutral sheet.

is critical to guarantee its correct operation. A closed-loop stability
analysis can be performed by analysing the impedance presented by the circuit
at a well-chosen node without internal access to the simulator. If any of the
poles of this impedance lie in the complex right half-plane, the circuit is
unstable. The classic way to detect unstable poles is to fit a rational model
on the impedance.
  In this paper, a projection-based method is proposed which splits the
impedance into a stable and an unstable part by projecting on an orthogonal
basis of stable and unstable functions. When the unstable part lies
significantly above the interpolation error of the method, the circuit is
considered unstable. Working with a projection provides one, at small cost,
with a first appraisal of the unstable part of the system.
  Both small-signal and large-signal stability analysis can be performed with
this projection-based method. In the small-signal case, a low-order rational
approximation can be fitted on the unstable part to find the location of the
unstable poles.

faint high-z galaxies, which is key to understanding the structural evolution
of galaxies. The technique of image stacking allows us to measure the averaged
light profile beneath the detection limit and probe the extended structure of a
group of galaxies. We carry out simulations to examine the recovery of the
averaged surface brightness profile through stacking model HST/ACS images of a
set of galaxies as functions of Sersic index (n), effective radius (Re) and
axis ratio (AR). The Sersic profile best fitting the radial profile of the
stacked image is taken as the recovered profile, in comparison with the
intrinsic mean profile of the model galaxies. Our results show that, in
general, the structural parameters of the mean profile can be properly
determined through stacking, although systematic biases need to be corrected
when spreads of Re and AR are counted. We find that Sersic index is slightly
overestimated and Re is underestimated at AR < 0.5 as the stacked image appears
to be more compact due to the presence of inclined galaxies; the spread of Re
biases the stacked profile to have a higher Sersic index. We stress that the
measurements of structural parameters through stacking should take these biases
into account. We estimate the biases in the recovered structural parameters
from stacks of galaxies when the samples have distributions of Re, AR and n
seen in local galaxies.

  Fluids",,,,"cond-mat.soft q-bio.CB","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  It is now well established that nearby beating pairs of eukaryotic flagella
or cilia typically synchronize in phase. A substantial body of evidence
supports the hypothesis that hydrodynamic coupling between the active
filaments, combined with waveform compliance, provides a robust mechanism for
synchrony. This elastohydrodynamic mechanism has been incorporated into
`bead-spring' models in which flagella are represented by microspheres tethered
by radial springs as internal forces drive them about orbits. While these
low-dimensional models reproduce the phenomenon of synchrony, their parameters
are not readily relatable to those of flagella. More realistic models which
reflect the elasticity of the axonemes and active force generation take the
form of fourth-order nonlinear PDEs. While computational studies have shown
synchrony, the effects of hydrodynamic coupling between nearby filaments
governed by such models have been theoretically examined only in the regime of
interflagellar distances $d$ large compared to flagellar length $L$. Yet, in
many biological situations $d/L \ll 1$. Here, we first present an asymptotic
analysis of the hydrodynamic coupling between two filaments in the regime $d/L
\ll 1$, and find that the form of the coupling is independent of the details of
the internal forces that govern the motion of the filaments. The analysis is
like the localized induction approximation for vortex filament motion, extended
to the case of mutual induction. To understand how the coupling mechanism leads
to synchrony of extended objects, we introduce a heuristic model of flagellar
beating, a single fourth-order nonlinear PDE whose form is derived from
symmetry considerations, the physics of elasticity, and the overdamped nature
of the dynamics. Analytical and numerical studies of this model illustrate how
synchrony between two filaments is achieved through the asymptotic coupling.

of great interest in space physics and interstellar astrophysics. These
processes are dominated by the scattering of particles off magnetic
irregularities. The scattering process itself is usually described by
small-angle scattering with the pitch-angle coefficient $D_{\mu\mu}$ playing a
major role. Since the diffusion coefficient $D_{\mu\mu}$ can be determined
analytically only for the approximation of quasi-linear theory, the
determination of this coefficient from numerical simulations has, therefore,
become more important. So far these simulations yield particle tracks for
small-scale scattering, which can then be interpreted using the running
diffusion coefficients. This method has a limited range of validity. This paper
presents two new methods that allow for the calculation of the pitch-angle
diffusion coefficient from numerical simulations. These methods no longer
analyse particle trajectories, but the change of particle distribution
functions. It is shown that they provide better resolved results and allow for
the analysis of strong turbulence. The application of these methods to Monte
Carlo simulations of particle scattering and hybrid MHD-particle simulations is
presented. Both analysis methods are able to recover the diffusion coefficients
used as input for the Monte Carlo simulations and provide better results in MHD
simulations especially for stronger turbulence.

the idea that AGB stars were the key players in the pollution of the

centers, data center networks strive for scalability and high throughput on the
one hand. On the other hand, the cost for networking hardware should be
minimized. Consequently, the number and complexity (e.g. TCAM size) of switches
has to be minimized. These requirements led to network topologies like Clos and
Leaf-Spine networks only requiring a shallow hierarchy of switches---two levels
for Leaf-Spine networks. The drawback of these topologies is that switches at
higher levels like Spine switches need a high port density and, thus, are
expensive and limit the scalability of the network.
  In this paper, we propose a data center network topology based on De Bruijn
graphs completely avoiding a switch hierarchy and implementing a flat network
topology of top-of-rack switches instead. This topology guarantees logarithmic
(short) path length. We show that the required routing logic can be implemented
by standard prefix matching operations in hardware (TCAM) allowing for using
commodity switches without any modification. Moreover, forwarding requires only
a very small number of forwarding table entries, saving costly and
energy-intensive TCAM.

interpret quasi-periodic pulsations (QPPs) in solar flares, it is unclear as to
how they are influenced by the combined effects of a continuous transverse
structuring and a finite internal plasma beta ($\beta_{\rm i}$). We derive a
generic dispersion relation (DR) governing linear sausage waves in straight
magnetic tubes for which plasma pressure is not negligible and the density and
temperature inhomogeneities of essentially arbitrary form take place in a layer
of arbitrary width. Focusing on fast modes, we find that $\beta_{\rm i}$ only
weakly influences $k_{\rm c}$, the critical longitudinal wavenumber separating
the leaky from trapped modes. Likewise, for both trapped and leaky modes, the
periods $P$ in units of the transverse fast time depend only weakly on
$\beta_{\rm i}$, which is compatible with the fact that the effective
wavevectors of fast sausage modes are largely perpendicular to the background
magnetic field. However, a weak $\beta_{\rm i}$ dependence of the damping times
$\tau$ is seen only when the length-to-radius ratio $L/R$ is $\sim 50\%$ larger
than some critical value $\pi/(k_{\rm c} R)$, which itself rather sensitively
depends on the density contrast, profile steepness as well as on how the
transverse structuring is described. In the context of QPPs, we conclude that
the much simpler zero-beta theory can be employed for trapped modes, as long as
one sees the deduced internal Alfv\'en speed as actually being the fast speed.
In contrast, effects due to a finite beta in flare loops should be considered
when leaky modes are exploited.

from the training process of deep neural network-based hidden Markov models
(HMM/DNN). For the GMM-free training of a HMM/DNN hybrid we have to solve two
problems, namely the initial alignment of the frame-level state labels and the
creation of context-dependent states. Although flat-start training via
iteratively realigning and retraining the DNN using a frame-level error
function is viable, it is quite cumbersome. Here, we propose to use a
sequence-discriminative training criterion for flat start. While
sequence-discriminative training is routinely applied only in the final phase
of model training, we show that with proper caution it is also suitable for
getting an alignment of context-independent DNN models. For the construction of
tied states we apply a recently proposed KL-divergence-based state clustering
method, hence our whole training process is GMM-free. In the experimental
evaluation we found that the sequence-discriminative flat start training method
is not only significantly faster than the straightforward approach of iterative
retraining and realignment, but the word error rates attained are slightly
better as well.

underground detectors are considered. We will focus on Weakly Interacting
Massive Particles (WIMP). Approaches will be compared in terms of (a)
robustness of sensitivity predictions, (b) timeline and (c) reach. The estimate
of the reach will be model-dependent. Given our ignorance about the nature of
dark matter, and the complementarity of detection techniques even within a
given framework (e.g. Supersymmetry), the trivial conclusion is that we might
need all approaches and the most sensitive experiments. Our discussion will be
somewhat more restrictive in order to be able to be more concrete. With the
caveat of incompleteness, under the assumption that the WIMP paradigm describes
nature, CTA is more likely to discover multi-TeV WIMP dark matter, whereas for
lower masses direct detection and LHC has significantly better prospects. We
will illustrate this conclusion with examples from foremost Supersymmetry, but
mention effective field theory or simplified models. We will comment on a few
models predicting high mass WIMPs, in particular 1 TeV higgsino and wino WIMPs,
as well as Minimal Dark Matter and point out the relevance of updated
measurements of the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon for CTAs role in

comparisons has been solved completely only for a few special cases. Graham and
Karp \cite{taocp} independently discovered that the tape merge algorithm is
optimal in the worst case when the two lists have the same size. In the seminal
papers, Stockmeyer and Yao\cite{yao}, Murphy and Paull\cite{3k3}, and
Christen\cite{christen1978optimality} independently showed when the lists to be
merged are of size $m$ and $n$ satisfying $m\leq
n\leq\lfloor\frac{3}{2}m\rfloor+1$, the tape merge algorithm is optimal in the
worst case. This paper extends this result by showing that the tape merge
algorithm is optimal in the worst case whenever the size of one list is no
larger than 1.52 times the size of the other. The main tool we used to prove
lower bounds is Knuth's adversary methods \cite{taocp}. In addition, we show
that the lower bound cannot be improved to 1.8 via Knuth's adversary methods.
We also develop a new inequality about Knuth's adversary methods, which might
be interesting in its own right. Moreover, we design a simple procedure to
achieve constant improvement of the upper bounds for $2m-2\leq n\leq 3m $.

an analogy to the forced pendulum. The oscillation of the inflaton field during
the reheating epoch after inflation plays the role of the driving force, while
the phase $\theta$ of a scalar baryon field (a complex scalar field with baryon
number) plays the role of the angle of the pendulum. When the inflaton is
coupled to the scalar baryon, the behavior of the phase $\theta$ can be
analogous to that of the angle of the forced pendulum. If the oscillation of
the driving force is adjusted to the pendulum's motion, a directed rotation of
the pendulum is obtained with a non-vanishing value of $\dot{\theta}$, which
models successful baryogenesis since $\dot{\theta}$ is proportional to the
baryon number density. Similar ratchet models which lead to directed motion
have been used in the study of molecular motors in biology. There, the driving
force is supplied by chemical reactions, while in our scenario this role is
played by the inflaton during the reheating epoch. Keywords: Baryogenesis;

jumps in pressure, temperature and effective number of degrees of freedom at

in general relativity to general gauge theories. In the original construction
the conserved current associated with a spacetime symmetry generated by a
Killing field $h^\mu$ is given by $\sqrt{-g}\,T^{\mu\nu}h_\nu$, where
$T^{\mu\nu}$ is the energy-momentum tensor of the matter. We show that if in a
Lagrangian field theory that has gauge symmetry in the general Noetherian sense
some of the elementary fields are fixed and are invariant under a particular
infinitesimal gauge transformation, then there is a current $\mathcal{B}^\mu$
that is analogous to $\sqrt{-g}\,T^{\mu\nu}h_\nu$ and is conserved if the
non-fixed fields satisfy their Euler-Lagrange equations. The conservation of
$\mathcal{B}^\mu$ can be seen as a consequence of an identity that is a
generalization of $\nabla_\mu T^{\mu\nu}=0$ and is a consequence of the gauge
symmetry of the Lagrangian. This identity holds in any configuration of the
fixed fields if the non-fixed fields satisfy their Euler-Lagrange equations. We
also show that $\mathcal{B}^\mu$ differs from the relevant canonical Noether
current by the sum of an identically conserved current and a term that vanishes
if the non-fixed fields are on-shell. As example we discuss the case of
general, possibly fermionic, matter fields propagating in fixed gravitational
and Yang-Mills background. We find that in this case the generalization of
$\nabla_\mu T^{\mu\nu}=0$ is the Lorentz law $\nabla_\mu T^{\mu\nu} -
F^{a\nu\lambda}\mathcal{J}_{a\lambda} = 0$, which holds as a consequence of the
diffeomorphism, local Lorentz and Yang-Mills gauge symmetry of the matter

a final Hamiltonian which differs from the initial one in the value of one
global parameter. We first derive general relations between time-averaged
expectation values of observables as well as correlation functions and those
obtained in an eigenstate of the final Hamiltonian. Our results are valid to
linear and quadratic order in the quench parameter g and generalize prior
insights in several essential ways. This allows us to develop a phenomenology
for the thermalization of local quantities up to a given order in g. Our
phenomenology is put to a test in several case studies of one-dimensional
models representative of four distinct classes of Hamiltonians: quadratic ones,
effectively quadratic ones, those characterized by an extensive set of (quasi-)
local integrals of motion, and those for which no such set is known (and
believed to be nonexistent). We show that for each of these models, all
observables and correlation functions thermalize to linear order in g. The more
local a given quantity, the longer the linear behavior prevails when increasing
g. Typical local correlation functions and observables for which the term O(g)
vanishes thermalize even to order g^2. Our results show that lowest order
thermalization of local observables is an ubiquitous phenomenon even in models
with extensive sets of integrals of motion.

residual diffeomorphisms, which might be ""observed"" by the observer as they do
not preserve her observables. The present paper is devoted to the analysis of
these diffeomorphisms in the case of the spatial and spacetime radial gauges.
Although the residual diffeomorphisms do not form a subgroup of all

structure functions of the algebras they form. The obtained algebras are

sophisticated negotiation skills with other road users when overtaking, giving
way, merging, taking left and right turns and while pushing ahead in
unstructured urban roadways. Since there are many possible scenarios, manually
tackling all possible cases will likely yield a too simplistic policy.
Moreover, one must balance between unexpected behavior of other
drivers/pedestrians and at the same time not to be too defensive so that normal
traffic flow is maintained.
  In this paper we apply deep reinforcement learning to the problem of forming
long term driving strategies. We note that there are two major challenges that
make autonomous driving different from other robotic tasks. First, is the
necessity for ensuring functional safety - something that machine learning has
difficulty with given that performance is optimized at the level of an
expectation over many instances. Second, the Markov Decision Process model
often used in robotics is problematic in our case because of unpredictable
behavior of other agents in this multi-agent scenario. We make three
contributions in our work. First, we show how policy gradient iterations can be
used without Markovian assumptions. Second, we decompose the problem into a
composition of a Policy for Desires (which is to be learned) and trajectory
planning with hard constraints (which is not learned). The goal of Desires is
to enable comfort of driving, while hard constraints guarantees the safety of
driving. Third, we introduce a hierarchical temporal abstraction we call an
""Option Graph"" with a gating mechanism that significantly reduces the effective

in depth investigation of the characteristic dispersion curves when the

micromorphic model generalizes the classical relaxed micromorphic model
previously introduced by the authors, since it features the Cartan-Lie
decomposition of the tensors $P_{,t}$ and Curl $P$ in their dev, dev sym, skew
and spheric part. It is shown that the split of the tensor $P_{,t}$ in the
micro-inertia provide an independent control of the cut-offs of the optic
benches. This is crucial for the future calibration of the relaxed micromorphic
model on real band-gap metamaterials.
  Even if the physical interest of the introduction of the split of the tensor
Curl $P$ is less evident than in the previous case, we discuss in detail which
is its effect on the dispersion curves. Finally, we also provide a complete
parametric study involving all the constitutive parameters of the introduced
model, so giving rise to an exhaustive panorama of dispersion curves for the
relaxed micromorphic model.

alternative to time-dependent DFT (TD-DFT) for the calculation of excitation
energies. Despite its formal simplicity and advantages in contrast to TD-DFT
(multiple excitations, for example, can be easily taken into account in an
ensemble), eDFT is not standard which is essentially due to the lack of
reliable approximate exchange-correlation (xc) functionals for ensembles.
Following Smith et al. [Phys. Rev. B 93, 245131 (2016)], we propose in this
work to construct an exact eDFT for the nontrivial asymmetric Hubbard dimer,
thus providing more insight into the weight dependence of the ensemble xc
energy in various correlation regimes. For that purpose, an exact analytical
expression for the weight-dependent ensemble exchange energy has been derived.
The complementary exact ensemble correlation energy has been computed by means
of Legendre--Fenchel transforms. Interesting features like discontinuities in
the ensemble xc potential in the strongly correlated limit have been
rationalized by means of a generalized adiabatic connection formalism. Finally,
functional-driven errors induced by ground-state density-functional
approximations have been studied. In the strictly symmetric case or in the
weakly correlated regime, combining ensemble exact exchange with ground-state
correlation functionals gives relatively accurate ensemble energies. However,
when approaching the equiensemble in the strongly correlated regime, this
approximation leads to highly curved ensemble energies with negative slope
which is unphysical. Using both ground-state exchange and correlation
functionals gives much better results in that case. In fact, exact ensemble
energies are almost recovered in some density domains. The analysis of
density-driven errors is left for future work.

the overhead of these approaches is one of the main bottlenecks for large-scale
quantum computation. In this paper, a hybrid approach is proposed which
combines the code concatenation technique with the other mentioned approaches.
The proposed approach outperforms code concatenation in terms of both number of
qubits and error threshold and also significantly reduces the resource overhead
of code switching, magic state distillation and pieceable fault-tolerance at
the cost of reducing the effective distance of the concatenated code for
implementing non-transversal gates.

provides unique insights into the extreme physical processes occurring in
relativistic jets and in the vicinity of super-massive black holes. To this
end, the long-term variability of the BL Lac object PKS 2155-304 is analyzed in
the high (HE, 100 MeV < E < 300 GeV) and very high energy (VHE, E > 200 GeV)
gamma-ray domain. Over the course of ~9 yr of H.E.S.S observations the VHE
light curve in the quiescent state is consistent with a log-normal behavior.
The VHE variability in this state is well described by flicker noise
(power-spectral-density index {\ss}_VHE = 1.10 +0.10 -0.13) on time scales
larger than one day. An analysis of 5.5 yr of HE Fermi LAT data gives
consistent results ({\ss}_HE = 1.20 +0.21 -0.23, on time scales larger than 10
days) compatible with the VHE findings. The HE and VHE power spectral densities
show a scale invariance across the probed time ranges. A direct linear
correlation between the VHE and HE fluxes could neither be excluded nor firmly
established. These long-term-variability properties are discussed and compared
to the red noise behavior ({\ss} ~ 2) seen on shorter time scales during
VHE-flaring states. The difference in power spectral noise behavior at VHE
energies during quiescent and flaring states provides evidence that these
states are influenced by different physical processes, while the compatibility
of the HE and VHE long-term results is suggestive of a common physical link as
it might be introduced by an underlying jet-disk connection.

nanostructure synthesis. Unfortunately, many as-synthesized nanomaterials,
including partially dealloyed nanoparticle catalysts for fuel cells, with
highly active surfaces are not stable in their reactive environments,
preventing widespread application. Thus, understanding instability by focusing
on the structure-stability and defect-stability relationship at the nanoscale
is crucial and will likely play an important role in meeting grand challenges.
To this end, recent advances in imaging nanostructure stability have come via
both electron, x-ray, and other techniques such as atomic force microscopy, but
tend to be limited to specific sample environments and/or two-dimensional
images. Here, we report investigations into the defect-stability relationship
of silver nanoparticles to voltage-induced electrochemical dissolution imaged
in-situ in three-dimensional (3D) detail by Bragg Coherent Diffractive Imaging
(BCDI). We first determine the average dissolution kinetics by Stationary Probe
Rotating Disk Electrode (SPRDE) in combination with inductively coupled plasma
mass spectrometry (ICP-MS), which allows real-time in-situ measurement of Ag+
ions formation and the corresponding electrochemical current. We then observe
the dissolution and redeposition processes in 3D with BCDI in single
nanocrystals, providing unique insight about the role of surface strain,
defects, and their coupling to the dissolution chemistry. The methods developed
and the knowledge gained go well beyond a ""simple"" silver electrochemistry and
are applicable to all electrocatalytic reactions where functional links between
activity and stability are controlled by structure and defect dynamics.

charge order implies an imbalance of electron and hole densities and therefore
doping away from half-filling. Our numerical results show that below a

two holes per unit cell and its partner under particle-hole transformation are
spontaneously generated. Our calculations are based on recent advances in

  Risk Minimizers","17 pages",,,,"math.ST stat.TH","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The generalization ability of minimizers of the empirical risk in the context
of binary classification has been investigated under a wide variety of
complexity assumptions for the collection of classifiers over which
optimization is performed. In contrast, the vast majority of the works
dedicated to this issue stipulate that the training dataset used to compute the
empirical risk functional is composed of i.i.d. observations. Beyond the cases
where training data are drawn uniformly without replacement among a large
i.i.d. sample or modelled as a realization of a weakly dependent sequence of
r.v.'s, statistical guarantees when the data used to train a classifier are
drawn by means of a more general sampling/survey scheme and exhibit a complex
dependence structure have not been documented yet. It is the main purpose of
this paper to show that the theory of empirical risk minimization can be
extended to situations where statistical learning is based on survey samples
and knowledge of the related inclusion probabilities. Precisely, we prove that
minimizing a weighted version of the empirical risk, refered to as the
Horvitz-Thompson risk (HT risk), over a class of controlled complexity lead to
a rate for the excess risk of the order $O_{\mathbb{P}}((\kappa_N (\log
N)/n)^{1/2})$ with $\kappa_N=(n/N)/\min_{i\leq N}\pi_i$, when data are sampled
by means of a rejective scheme of (deterministic) size $n$ within a statistical
population of cardinality $N\geq n$, a generalization of basic {\it sampling
without replacement} with unequal probability weights $\pi_i>0$. Extension to
other sampling schemes are then established by a coupling argument. Beyond
theoretical results, numerical experiments are displayed in order to show the
relevance of HT risk minimization and that ignoring the sampling scheme used to
generate the training dataset may completely jeopardize the learning procedure.

to test their chemical modeling under dynamic astrophysical conditions. It was
also designed to identify statistical trends that may appear when running many
models of the formation of low-mass stars by varying the initial conditions. A
large set of 143 calculations of the gravitational collapse of an isolated
sphere of gas with uniform temperature and a Bonnor-Ebert like density profile
was undertaken using a 1D fully implicit Lagrangian radiation hydrodynamics
code. The parameter space covered initial masses from 0.2 to 8 Msun,
temperatures of 5-30 K and radii between 3000 and 30,000 AU. A spread in the
thermal evolutionary tracks of the runs was found, due to differing initial
conditions and optical depths. Within less than an order of magnitude, all
first and second Larson cores had masses and radii independent of the initial
conditions. The time elapsed between the formation of the first and second
cores was found to strongly depend on the first core mass accretion rate, and
no first core in our grid of models lived for longer than 2000 years, before
the onset of the second collapse. The end product of a protostellar cloud
collapse, the second Larson core, is, at birth, a canonical object with a mass
and radius of about 3 Mjup and 8 Rjup, independent of its initial conditions.
The evolution sequence which brings the gas to stellar densities can however
proceed in a variety of scenarios, on different timescales, along different
isentropes, but each story line can largely be predicted by the initial
conditions. All the data from the simulations are publicly available at this

occupy a temperature regime similar to low mass M-dwarfs, where minimal cloud
condensation is expected. However, observations of exoplanets such as WASP-12b
(Teq ~ 2500 K) result in a transmission spectrum indicative of a cloudy
atmosphere. We re-examine the temperature and pressure space occupied by these
super-hot Jupiter atmospheres, to explore the role of the initial Al- and
Ti-bearing condensates as the main source of cloud material. Due to the high
temperatures a majority of the more common refractory material is not depleted
into deeper layers and would remain in the vapor phase. The lack of depletion
into deeper layers means that these materials with relatively low cloud masses
can become significant absorbers in the upper atmosphere. We provide
condensation curves for the initial Al- and Ti-bearing condensates that may be
used to provide quantitative estimates of the effect of metallicity on cloud
masses, as planets with metal-rich hosts potentially form more opaque clouds
because more mass is available for condensation. Increased metallicity also
pushes the point of condensation to hotter, deeper layers in the planetary
atmosphere further increasing the density of the cloud. We suggest that planets
around metal-rich hosts are more likely to have thick refractory clouds, and
discuss the implication on the observed spectra of WASP-12b.

Several experimental investigations of nonlocality have been carried out over

experiments do not consider a crucial ingredient that is ubiquitous in quantum
networks: the fact that correlations between distant parties are mediated by
several, typically independent, sources of quantum states. Here, using a
photonic setup we investigate a quantum network consisting of three spatially
separated nodes whose correlations are mediated by two independent sources.
This scenario allows for the emergence of a new kind of non-local correlations

from the existence of Noether symmetries for $f(R)$, is sufficient to implement
the approach. In fact, relations between the FP parameters and the corrected
Newtonian potential, coming from $R^n$, can be found and justified from a
physical point of view. Specifically, we analyze the velocity distribution of
elliptical galaxies and obtain that $r_c$, the scale-length depending on the
gravitational system properties, is proportional to $r_e$, the galaxy effective
radius. This fact points out that the gravitational corrections induced by
$f(R)$ can lead photometry and dynamics of the system. Furthermore, the main
byproduct of such an approach is that gravity could work in different ways
depending on the scales of self-gravitating systems.

estimate its state using an on-board camera and an inertial sensor, without any
prior knowledge of the external environment. We consider the case in which the
robot can allocate limited resources to VIN, due to tight computational
constraints. Therefore, we answer the following question: under limited
resources, what are the most relevant visual cues to maximize the performance
of visual-inertial navigation? Our approach has four key ingredients. First, it
is task-driven, in that the selection of the visual cues is guided by a metric
quantifying the VIN performance. Second, it exploits the notion of
anticipation, since it uses a simplified model for forward-simulation of robot
dynamics, predicting the utility of a set of visual cues over a future time
horizon. Third, it is efficient and easy to implement, since it leads to a
greedy algorithm for the selection of the most relevant visual cues. Fourth, it
provides formal performance guarantees: we leverage submodularity to prove that
the greedy selection cannot be far from the optimal (combinatorial) selection.
Simulations and real experiments on agile drones show that our approach ensures
state-of-the-art VIN performance while maintaining a lean processing time. In
the easy scenarios, our approach outperforms appearance-based feature selection
in terms of localization errors. In the most challenging scenarios, it enables
accurate visual-inertial navigation while appearance-based feature selection
fails to track robot's motion during aggressive maneuvers.

Techniques exist for producing ""pure"" E and B maps, which are guaranteed to be

constructing an eigenbasis, has a high computational cost. We show that such
pure maps can be thought of as resulting from the application of a Wiener
filter to the data. This perspective leads to far more efficient methods of
producing pure maps. Moreover, by expressing the idea of purification in the
general framework of Wiener filtering (i.e., maximization of a posterior

denial of service attacks, the distributions of link states could be stochastic
(benign) or adversarial at different temporal and spatial locations. Without
any \emph{a priori}, designing an adaptive SPR protocol to cope with all

paper, we present the first solution by formulating it as a multi-armed bandit
(MAB) problem. By introducing a novel control parameter into the exploration
phase for each link, a martingale inequality is applied in the our
combinatorial adversarial MAB framework. As such, our proposed algorithms could
automatically detect features of the environment within a unified framework and
find the optimal SPR strategies with almost optimal learning performance in all
possible cases over time. Moreover, we study important issues related to the
practical implementation, such as decoupling route selection with multi-path
route probing, cooperative learning among multiple sources, the ""cold-start""
issue and delayed feedback of our algorithm. Nonetheless, the proposed SPR
algorithms can be implemented with low complexity and they are proved to scale
very well with the network size. Comparing to existing approaches in a typical

signal processing (DSP) blocks for multiply-accumulate operations enable
efficient fixed-point computations, in cases where the filter structure is
accurately mapped to the dedicated hardware architecture. This brief presents a
generic systolic structure for high-order FIR filters, efficiently exploiting
the hardware resources of an FPGA in terms of routability and timing. Although
this seems to be an easily implementable task, the synthesizing tools require
an adaptation of the straightforward digital filter implementation for an
optimal mapping. Using the example of a symmetric FIR filter with 90 taps, we
demonstrate the performance of the proposed structure with FPGAs from Xilinx
and Altera. The implementation utilizes less than 1% of slice logic and runs at
clock frequencies up to 526 MHz. Moreover, an enhancement of the structure
ultimately provides an extended dynamic range for the quantized coefficients
without the costs of additional slice logic.

dense matter, relevant for the description of core-collapse supernovae, compact
stars and compact star mergers. The emphasis is put on models that are
applicable to all of these scenarios. Such EoS models have to cover large
ranges in baryon number density, temperature and isospin asymmetry. The
characteristics of matter change dramatically within these ranges, from a
mixture of nucleons, nuclei, and electrons to uniform, strongly interacting
matter containing nucleons, and possibly other particles such as hyperons or
quarks. As the development of an EoS requires joint efforts from many
directions we consider different theoretical approaches and discuss relevant
experimental and observational constraints which provide insights for future
research. Finally, results from applications of the discussed EoS models are
summarized.

Dynamical Systems II coursed at DTU (Denmark) during the Winter Semester
2015-2016, and later extended in February 2017. They aim to provide students
with a theoretical and numerical background for the computation of periodic
orbits using Newton's method. We focus on periodically perturbed
quasi-integrable systems (using the forced pendulum as an example) and hence we
take advantage of the Melnikov method to get first guesses. However, these well
known techniques are general enough to be applied in other type of systems.
Periodic orbits are computed by solving a fixed-point equation for the
stroboscopic map, which is very fast and precise. We also consider computing
the Poincar\'e map and compare both strategies. In both cases we show how to
compute the Jacobian of the maps, which is necessary for the Newton method, by
means of variational equations and the implicit function theorem. Some
exercises are proposed along the notes, whose solutions can be found in
github.com/a-granados. The notes themselves do not contain any reference,
although everything described here is well known in the Dynamical Systems
community. A typical reference for the Melnikov method for subharmonic orbits
is the book [GucHol83]. More about the variational equations and their
numerical applications can be found in the notes [Sim].

another, and brought to their limits on large-scale instances. It consists of a
variety of grayscale images, in various resolutions and classes, such as
several types of randomly generated images, classical test images and real data
from microscopy.
  Along with the DOTmark we present a survey and a performance test for a cross

shielding neighborhood method, and including also a comparison with commercial

goal is to move the state of a CPS to a target state while ensuring that his or

constraints on the induced bias that reflect the attacker's detection-avoidance

linear feedback of the attacker's state estimate. In the case that the
attacker's bias is upper bounded by a positive constant, we provide two

describe the cosmological observations exceedingly well, power law expansion of
the Universe scale radius, $R(t)\propto t^n$, has been proposed as an
alternative framework. We examine here these models, analyzing their ability to
fit cosmological data using robust model comparison criteria. Type Ia
supernovae (SNIa), baryonic acoustic oscillations (BAO) and acoustic scale
information from the cosmic microwave background (CMB) have been used. We find
that SNIa data either alone or combined with BAO can be well reproduced by both
$\Lambda$CDM and power law expansion models with $n\sim 1.5$, while the
constant expansion rate model $(n=1)$ is clearly disfavored. Allowing for some
redshift evolution in the SNIa luminosity essentially removes any clear
preference for a specific model. The CMB data are well known to provide the
most stringent constraints on standard cosmological models, in particular,
through the position of the first peak of the temperature angular power
spectrum, corresponding to the sound horizon at recombination, a scale
physically related to the BAO scale. Models with $n\geq 1$ lead to a divergence
of the sound horizon and do not naturally provide the relevant scales for the
BAO and the CMB. We retain an empirical footing to overcome this issue: we let
the data choose the preferred values for these scales, while we recompute the
ionization history in power law models, to obtain the distance to the CMB. In
doing so, we find that the scale coming from the BAO data is not consistent
with the observed position of the first peak of the CMB temperature angular
power spectrum for any power law cosmology. Therefore, we conclude that when
the three standard probes are combined, the $\Lambda$CDM model is very strongly
favored over any of these alternative models, which are then essentially ruled
out.

each event, the solvability of these equations determines a limited region on
the trial $m_Y$-$m_N$ plane. The edge of this region can be used to define two

utilized to derive the measurement values of $m_Y$ and $m_N$. The measurement
deviations and uncertainties are also estimated after including detector

attention from the research community; the simplest and most thoroughly studied
of them are consensus protocols in the form of differential or difference
equations over general time-varying weighted graphs. These graphs are usually
characterized algebraically by their associated Laplacian matrices. Network
algorithms with similar algebraic graph theoretic structures, called being of
Laplacian-type in this paper, also arise in other related multi-agent control
problems, such as aggregation and containment control, target surrounding,
distributed optimization and modeling of opinion evolution in social groups. In
spite of their similarities, each of such algorithms has often been studied
using separate mathematical techniques. In this paper, a novel approach is
offered, allowing a unified and elegant way to examine many Laplacian-type
algorithms for multi-agent coordination. This approach is based on the analysis
of some differential or difference inequalities that have to be satisfied by
the some ""outputs"" of the agents (e.g. the distances to the desired set in
aggregation problems). Although such inequalities may have many unbounded
solutions, under natural graphic connectivity conditions all their bounded
solutions converge (and even reach consensus), entailing the convergence of the
corresponding distributed algorithms. In the theory of differential equations
the absence of bounded non-convergent solutions is referred to as the
equation's dichotomy. In this paper, we establish the dichotomy criteria of
Laplacian-type differential and difference inequalities and show that these
criteria enable one to extend a number of recent results, concerned with
Laplacian-type algorithms for multi-agent coordination and modeling opinion
formation in social groups.

there is a huge volume of parameter space, with a predominantly Higgsino dark

polyimide substrates by Angle-resolved Polarized Raman spectra (ARPRS) using
442 nm excitation wavelength. The results revealed that ARPRS with 442 nm
excitation can provide unambiguous, convenient, non-destructive and fast
determination of BP's crystallographic orientation. The substrate and thickness
dependencies of Raman spectra and Raman tensor elements were studied. These
dependencies were shown to be influenced by Raman excitation laser heating
effect. By comparing with in-situ Raman measurements at elevated temperatures,
we were able to quantify the laser-heating effect, which is significant and
hard to avoid for Raman measurements of BP on polyimide substrates due to the
poor thermal conductivity of the substrate. Thermal processing by substrate
heating was shown to have a significant impact on BP on SiO2/Si substrate, but
not for BP on polyimide due to smaller thermal expansion mismatch. Our results
give important insights on Raman Spectroscopy characterizations of BP on
different substrates.

  the Lovasz Local Lemma",,,,,"cs.DS cs.DC math.PR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Many randomized algorithms can be derandomized efficiently using either the
method of conditional expectations or probability spaces with low (almost-)
independence. A series of papers, beginning with Luby (1993) and continuing
with Berger & Rompel (1991) and Chari et al. (2000), showed that these
techniques can be combined to give deterministic parallel algorithms for
combinatorial optimization problems involving sums of $w$-juntas. We improve
these algorithms through derandomized variable partitioning and a new code
construction for fooling Fourier characters over $GF(2)$. This reduces the
processor complexity to essentially independent of $w$ while the running time
is reduced from exponential in $w$ to linear in $w$.
  As a key subroutine, we give a new algorithm to generate a probability space
which can fool a given set of neighborhoods. Schulman (1992) gave an NC
algorithm to do so for neighborhoods of size $w \leq O(\log n)$. Our new
algorithm is NC1, with essentially optimal time and processor complexity, when
$w = O(\log n)$; it remains NC up to $w = \text{polylog}(n)$. This answers an
open problem of Schulman.
  One major application of these algorithms is an NC algorithm for the
Lov\'{a}sz Local Lemma. Previous NC algorithms, including the seminal algorithm
of Moser & Tardos (2010) and the work of Chandrasekaran et. al (2013), required
that (essentially) the bad-events could span only $O(\log n)$ variables; we
relax this to $\text{polylog}(n)$ variables. We use this for an $\text{NC}^2$
algorithm for defective vertex coloring, which works for arbitrary degree
graphs.

projection. We implemented the complete system on a Samsung Galaxy K-Zoom

The rotation induces a vertical motion for an atom initially at rest. The
motion is a result of the action of two inertial forces, namely the centrifugal
force and the Coriolis force. Both inertial forces force the atom to rotate in
a direction opposite to that of the angular velocity of the HOT. The frequency

large values of the angular velocity of the HOT the atom can escape from the

Homogenisation (CH). At each macrostructure Gauss point, constitutive matrices
for thermal, moisture transport and mechanical responses are calculated from CH
of the underlying representative volume element (RVE). A degradation model,
developed from experimental data relating evolution of mechanical properties
over time for a given exposure temperature and moisture concentration is also
developed and incorporated in the proposed computational model. A unified
approach is used to impose the RVE boundary conditions, which allows convenient
switching between linear Dirichlet, uniform Neumann and periodic boundary
conditions. A plain weave textile composite RVE consisting of yarns embedded in
a matrix is considered in this case. Matrix and yarns are considered as
isotropic and transversely isotropic materials respectively. Furthermore, the
computational framework utilises hierarchic basis functions and designed to
take advantage of distributed memory high-performance computing.

we investigate the effects of topological edge states on the thermoelectric

the edge and bulk contributions to the Seebeck coefficients. However, the
electronic transport of the system is dominated by the edge states because of
its much larger electrical conductivity. As a consequence, a room temperature
value exceeding 3.0 could be achieved for both p- and n-type systems when the
relaxation time ratio between the edge and the bulk states is tuned to be 1000.
Our theoretical study suggests that the utilization of topological edge states

gradient micro-inertia is used to describe the dynamical behavior of a real
two-dimensional phononic crystal for a wide range of wavelengths. In
particular, a periodic structure with specific micro-structural topology and
mechanical properties, capable of opening a phononic band-gap, is chosen with
the criterion of showing a low degree of anisotropy (the band-gap is almost
independent of the direction of propagation of the traveling wave). A Bloch
wave analysis is performed to obtain the dispersion curves and the
corresponding vibrational modes of the periodic structure. A linear-elastic,
isotropic, relaxed micromorphic model including both a free micro-inertia
(related to free vibrations of the microstructures) and a gradient
micro-inertia (related to the motions of the microstructure which are coupled
to the macro-deformation of the unit cell) is introduced and particularized to
the case of plane wave propagation. The parameters of the relaxed model, which
are independent of frequency, are then calibrated on the dispersion curves of
the phononic crystal showing an excellent agreement in terms of both dispersion
curves and vibrational modes. Almost all the homogenized elastic parameters of
the relaxed micromorphic model result to be determined. This opens the way to
the design of morphologically complex meta-structures which make use of the
chosen phononic structure as the basic building block and which preserve its
ability of ""stopping"" elastic wave propagation at the scale of the structure.

Minkowski momentum in macroscopic electrodynamics (essential for the

a simple dielectric model where the refractive index $n$ is constant, we
demonstrate by means of a mapping procedure how the electromagnetic field in a
medium can be mapped into a corresponding field in vacuum. This mapping was
presented many years ago [I. Brevik and B. Lautrup, Mat. Fys. Medd. Dan. Vid.
Selsk {\bf 38}(1), 1 (1970)], but is apparently not well known. A
characteristic property of this procedure is that it shows how natural the
Minkowski energy-momentum tensor fits into the canonical formalism. Especially
the spacelike character of the electromagnetic total four-momentum for a
radiation field (implying negative electromagnetic energy in some inertial
frames), so strikingly demonstrated in the Cherenkov effect, is worth
attention. (2) Our second objective is to give a critical analysis of some
recent experiments on electromagnetic momentum. Care must here be taken in the
interpretations: it is easy to be misled and conclude that an experiment is
important for the energy-momentum problem, while what is demonstrated
experimentally is merely the action of the Abraham-Minkowski force acting in
surface layers or inhomogeneous regions. The Abraham-Minkowski force is common
for the two energy-momentum tensors and carries no information about field
momentum. As a final item, we propose an experiment that might show the
existence of the Abraham force at high frequencies. This would eventually be a
welcome optical analogue to the classic low-frequency 1975 Lahoz-Walker

energetic levels of holes in $\mathrm{CuO}_{2}$ conducting layers of cuprates.
We prove that two energetically near-lying interacting bands can explain the
electron-hole asymmetry. Indeed, we rigorously analyze the phase diagram of the
model and show that the critical temperatures for fermion densities below
half-filling can manifest a very different behavior as compared to the case of
densities above half-filling. This fact results from the inter-band interaction
and intra-band Coulomb repulsion in interplay with thermal fluctuations between
two energetic levels. So, if the energy difference between bands is too big
then the asymmetry disappears. Moreover, the critical temperature turns out to
be a non-monotonic function of the fermion density and the phase diagram of our
model shows ""superconducting domes"" as in high-$T_{c}$ cuprate superconductors.
This explains why the maximal critical temperature is attained at donor
densities away from the maximal one. Outside the superconducting phase and for
fermion densities near half-filling the thermodynamics governed by our
Hamiltonian corresponds, as in real high-$T_c$ materials, to a Mott-insulating
phase. The nature of the inter-band interaction can be electrostatic (screened
Coulomb interaction), magnetic (for instance some Heisenberg-type one-site
spin-spin interaction), or a mixture of both. If the inter-band interaction is
predominately magnetic then - additionally to the electron-hole asymmetry - we
observe a reentering behavior meaning that the superconducting phase can only
occur in a finite interval of temperatures. This phenomenon is rather rare, but
has also been observed in the so-called magnetic superconductors.
