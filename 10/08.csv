familiar notion of dimension which, for a given metric space, returns the
minimal exponent $\alpha\geq 0$ such that for any pair of scales $0<r<R$, any
ball of radius $R$ may be covered by a constant times $(R/r)^\alpha$ balls of
radius $r$. To each $\theta \in (0,1)$, we associate the appropriate analogue
of the Assouad dimension with the restriction that the two scales $r$ and $R$
used in the definition satisfy $\log R/\log r = \theta$. The resulting
`dimension spectrum' (as a function of $\theta$) thus gives finer geometric
information regarding the scaling structure of the space and, in some precise
sense, interpolates between the upper box dimension and the Assouad dimension.
This latter point is particularly useful because the spectrum is generally
better behaved than the Assouad dimension. We also consider the corresponding
`lower spectrum', motivated by the lower dimension, which acts as a dual to the
Assouad spectrum.
  We conduct a detailed study of these dimension spectra; including analytic,
geometric, and measureability properties. We also compute the spectra
explicitly for some common examples of fractals including decreasing sequences
with decreasing gaps and spirals with sub-exponential and monotonic winding. We
also give several applications of our results, including: dimension distortion
estimates under bi-H\""older maps for Assouad dimension and the provision of new
bi-Lipschitz invariants.

main goal of the present paper is to study the dynamical effects induced by
three different internal structures (uniform, three- and four-layers) of
asteroid (21) Lutetia, an object that recent results from space probe suggest
being at least partially differentiated. The Mascon gravity approach used in
the present work, consists of dividing each tetrahedron into eight parts to
calculate the gravitational field around the asteroid. The zero-velocity curves
show that the greatest displacement of the equilibrium points occurs in the
position of the E4 point for the four-layers structure and the smallest one
occurs in the position of the E3 point for the three-layers structure.
Moreover, stability against impact shows that the planar limit gets slightly
closer to the body with the four-layered structure.
  We then investigated the stability of orbital motion in the equatorial plane
of (21) Lutetia and propose numerical stability criteria to map the region of
stable motions. Layered structures could stabilize orbits that were unstable in

$g-r$ colour, followed by stellar mass surface density, bulge fraction and

two control parameters, that indicate how well a given galaxy in SDSS is

The dispersive medium allows us to select a narrow band of the frequency

models linking a large set of potential covariates to a response in a nonlinear
fashion, such as when the response is binary. Although this modeling problem
has been extensively studied, it remains unclear how to effectively control the
fraction of false discoveries even in high-dimensional logistic regression, not
to mention general high-dimensional nonlinear models. To address such a
practical problem, we propose a new framework of $model$-$X$ knockoffs, which
reads from a different perspective the knockoff procedure (Barber and Cand\`es,
2015) originally designed for controlling the false discovery rate in linear
models. Whereas the knockoffs procedure is constrained to homoscedastic linear
models with $n\ge p$, the key innovation here is that model-X knockoffs provide
valid inference from finite samples in settings in which the conditional
distribution of the response is arbitrary and completely unknown. Furthermore,
this holds no matter the number of covariates. Correct inference in such a
broad setting is achieved by constructing knockoff variables probabilistically
instead of geometrically. To do this, our approach requires the covariates be
random (independent and identically distributed rows) with a distribution that
is known, although we provide preliminary experimental evidence that our
procedure is robust to unknown/estimated distributions. To our knowledge, no
other procedure solves the $controlled$ variable selection problem in such
generality, but in the restricted settings where competitors exist, we
demonstrate the superior power of knockoffs through simulations. Finally, we
apply our procedure to data from a case-control study of Crohn's disease in the
United Kingdom, making twice as many discoveries as the original analysis of
the same data.

\emph{benefit of collaboration} is 2 in general. We also show that the benefit
of collaboration for a single message is~$1/\ln 2 \approx 1.44$. Planning turns
out to be \NP-hard to approximate even for a single agent, but can be
2-approximated in polynomial time if agents have unit capacities and do not

unit capacity, but can be efficiently solved exactly if they have uniform

and unbarred, with various stellar masses, to study the impact of the bar on
star formation history. Unbarred galaxies evolve very smoothly, with a star
formation rate (SFR) that varies by at most a factor of three over a period of
2 Gyr. The evolution of barred galaxies is much more irregular, especially at
high stellar masses. In these galaxies, the bar drives a substantial amount of
gas toward the centre, resulting in a high SFR, and producing a starburst in
the most massive galaxies. Most of the gas is converted into stars, and gas
exhaustion leads to a rapid drop of star formation after the starburst. In
massive barred galaxies (stellar mass M* > 2x10^10 Msun) the large amount of
gas funnelled toward the centre is completely consumed by the starburst, while
in lower-mass barred galaxies it is only partially consumed. Gas concentration
is thus higher in lower-mass barred galaxies than it is in higher-mass ones.
Even though unbarred galaxies funnelled less gas toward their centre, the lower
SFR allows this gas to accumulate. At late times, the star formation efficiency
is higher in barred galaxies than unbarred ones, enabling these galaxies to
maintain a higher SFR with a smaller gas supply. Several properties, such as
the global SFR, central SFR, or central gas concentration, vary monotonically
with time for unbarred galaxies, but not for barred galaxies. Therefore one
must be careful when comparing barred and unbarred galaxies that share one
observational property, since these galaxies might be at very different stages
of their respective evolution.

developed primarily by number theorists and theoretical computer scientists. A
motivated uninitiated peer could encounter difficulties perusing the
literature, due to various synonyms and polysemes used by different schools.
One purpose of this note is to provide a short introduction for probabilists.
We proceed by recalling a perspective originating in a work of the second
author from 2002. Using it, various new examples of completely uniformly
distributed (mod 1) sequences, in the ""metric"" (meaning almost sure stochastic)
sense, can be easily exhibited. In particular, we point out natural
generalizations of the original $p$-multiply equidistributed sequence $k^p\, t$
mod 1, $k\geq 1$ (where $p\in \mathbb{N}$ and $t\in[0,1]$), due to Hermann Weyl
in 1916. In passing, we also derive a Weyl-like criterion for weakly completely
equidistributed (also known as WCUD) sequences, of substantial recent interest
in MCMC simulations.
  The translation from number theory to probability language brings into focus
a version of the strong law of large numbers for weakly correlated
complex-valued random variables, the study of which was initiated by Weyl in
the aforementioned manuscript, followed up by Davenport, Erd\""{o}s and LeVeque
in 1963, and greatly extended by Russell Lyons in 1988. In this context, an
application to $\infty$-distributed Koksma's numbers $t^k$ mod 1, $k\geq 1$
(where $t\in[1,a]$ for some $a>1$), and an important generalization by
Niederreiter and Tichy from 1985 are discussed.
  The paper contains negligible amount of new mathematics in the strict sense,
but its perspective and open questions included in the end could be of
considerable interest to probabilists and statisticians, as well as certain
computer scientists and number theorists.

solutions of Einstein equations describing razor-thin disks. Despite the
progress in the area, the analytical study of geodesic motion crossing the disk
plane in these systems is not yet so developed. In the present work, we propose
a definite vertical stability criterion for circular equatorial timelike
geodesics in static, axially symmetric thin disks, possibly surrounded by other
structures preserving axial symmetry. It turns out that the strong energy
condition for the disk stress-energy content is sufficient for vertical
stability of these orbits. Moreover, adiabatic invariance of the vertical
action variable gives us an approximate third integral of motion for oblique
orbits which deviate slightly from the equatorial plane. Such new approximate
third integral certainly points to a better understanding of the analytical
properties of these orbits. The results presented here, derived for static
spacetimes, may be a starting point to study the motion around rotating,
stationary razor-thin disks. Our results also allow us to conjecture that the
strong energy condition should be sufficient to assure transversal stability of
periodic orbits for any singular timelike hypersurface, provided it is
invariant under the geodesic flow.

result. This approach can save a lot of training time than single CNN-ELM
models trained alone. This approach also increased the scalability of machine
learning by combining scale out and scale up approaches. We verified our method
in extended MNIST data set and not-MNIST data set experiment. However, it has
some drawbacks by additional iteration learning parameters that need to be
carefully taken and training data distribution that need to be carefully

computer code: what functions and in what order they are called, how
information travels around static, input, and output variables, what depends on
what. As a rule, executable code and data are scattered among multiple files
and even multiple modules. Information is transmitted among variables which
often change names. These tangled relations greatly complicate the development,
maintenance, and redevelopment of code, its analysis for complexity and its
robustness. As of now, there is no tool which is capable of presenting the
real-life, useful diagram of actual code. Conventional flowcharts fail.
Proposed is the method which overcomes these difficulties. The main idea is
that functionality of software can be described through flows of control, which
is essentially flows of time, and flows of data. These are inseparable. The
second idea is to follow very strict system boundaries and distinctions with
respect to modules, functions, blocks, and operators, as well as data holders,
showing them all as subsystems, in other words, by clearly expressing the
system structure when every piece of executable code and every variable may
have its own graphical representation. The third is defining timelines as the
entities clearly separated from the connected blocks of code. Timelines allow
presentation of nesting of the control flow as deep as necessary. As a proof of
concept, the same methods successfully describe production systems. Keywords:

gaits. However, step duration adaptation is often neglected in control
strategies. In this paper, we propose an approach that combines both step
location and timing adjustment for generating robust gaits. In this approach,
step location and step timing are decided, based on feedback from the current
state of the robot. The proposed approach is comprised of two stages. In the
first stage, the nominal step location and step duration for the next step or a
previewed number of steps are specified. In this stage which is done at the
start of each step, the main goal is to specify the best step length and step
duration for a desired walking speed. The second stage deals with finding the
best landing point and landing time of the swing foot at each control cycle. In
this stage, stability of the gaits is preserved by specifying a desired offset
between the swing foot landing point and the Divergent Component of Motion
(DCM) at the end of current step. After specifying the landing point of the
swing foot at a desired time, the swing foot trajectory is regenerated at each
control cycle to realize desired landing properties. Simulation on different
scenarios shows the robustness of the generated gaits from our proposed
approach compared to the case where no timing adjustment is employed.

to it based on the Pechukas-Yukawa formalism, which is especially convenient in
case of an adiabatically slow external perturbation. In this formalism the
dynamics of energy levels in an externally perturbed quantum system as a
function of the perturbation parameter is mapped on that of a fictitious
one-dimensional classical gas of particles with cubic repulsion. Equilibrium
statistical mechanics of this Pechukas gas allows to reproduce the random
matrix theory of energy levels. In the present work, we develop the
nonequilibrium statistical mechanics of the Pechukas gas, starting with the
derivation of the Bogoliubov-Born-Green-Kirkwood-Yvon (BBGKY) chain of
equations for the appropriate generalized distribution functions. Sets of
approximate kinetic equations can be consistently obtained by breaking this
chain at a particular point (i.e. approximating all higher-order distribution
functions by the products of the lower-order ones). When complemented by the
equations for the level occupation numbers and inter-level transition
amplitudes, they allow to describe the nonequilibrium evolution of the quantum
state of the system, which can describe better a large quantum coherent system
than the currently used approaches. In particular, we find that corrections to
the factorized approximation of the distribution function scale as 1/N, where N
is the number of the ""Pechukas gas particles"" (i.e. energy levels in the
system).

Using Onsager's variational principle, we derive the equations that govern the
relaxation dynamics of the membrane shape, of the mass densities of the bilayer
leaflets, and of the diffusing proteins' concentration. With our generic
formalism, we obtain several results on membrane dynamics. We find that
proteins that span the bilayer increase the intermonolayer friction
coefficient. The renormalization, which can be significant, is in inverse
proportion to the protein's mobility. Second, we find that asymmetric proteins
couple to the membrane curvature and to the difference in monolayer densities.
For practically all accessible membrane tensions ($\sigma> 10^{-8}$ N/m) we
show that the protein density is the slowest relaxing variable. Furthermore,
its relaxation rate decreases at small wavelengths due to the coupling to
curvature. We apply our formalism to the large-scale diffusion of a
concentrated protein patch. We find that the diffusion profile is not
self-similar, owing to the wavevector dependence of the effective diffusion
coefficient.

geometric framework for the open problem as to whether {\it regularity

smoothness of the gravitational metric is only Lipschitz continuous) can be
created by shock wave interaction in GR, or whether metrics Lipschitz at shocks

that even non-attention based models can localize inputs. We devise a way to

provide textual explanations for model decisions. Finally, we design and
conduct human studies to measure if Grad-CAM helps users establish appropriate

developed and combined into a system for estimating time-difference estimates,
microphone localization and sound source movement. No assumptions on the 3D
locations of the microphones and sound sources are made. The system is capable
of tracking continuously moving sound sources in an reverberant environment.
The multi-path components are explicitly tracked and used in the geometry
estimation parts. The system is based on matching between pairs of channels
using GCC-PHAT. Instead of taking a single maximum at each time instant from
each such pair, we select the four strongest local maxima. This produce a set
of hypothesis to work with in the subsequent steps, where consistency
constraints between the channels and time-continuity constraints are exploited.
In the paper it demonstrated how such detections can be used to estimate
microphone positions, sound source movement and room geometry. The methods are
tested and verified using real data from several reverberant environments. The
evaluation demonstrated accuracy in the order of few millimeters.

halo-to-halo variance of dark matter substructure. Using a combination of
N-body simulations and a semi-analytical model, we investigate the variance in
subhalo mass fractions and subhalo occupation numbers, with an emphasis on how
these statistics scale with halo formation time. We demonstrate that the
subhalo mass fraction, f_sub, is mainly a function of halo formation time, with
earlier forming haloes having less substructure. At fixed formation redshift,
the average f_sub is virtually independent of halo mass, and the mass
dependence of f_sub is therefore mainly a manifestation of more massive haloes
assembling later. We compare observational constraints on f_sub from
gravitational lensing to our model predictions and simulation results. Although
the inferred f_sub are substantially higher than the median LCDM predictions,
they fall within the 95th percentile due to halo-to-halo variance. We show that
while the halo occupation distribution of subhaloes, P(N|M), is
super-Poissonian for large <N>, a well established result, it becomes
sub-Poissonian for <N> < 2. Ignoring the non-Poissonity results in systematic
errors of the clustering of galaxies of a few percent, and with a complicated
scale- and luminosity-dependence. Earlier-formed haloes have P(N|M) closer to a
Poisson distribution, suggesting that the dynamical evolution of subhaloes
drives the statistics towards Poissonian. Contrary to a recent claim, the
non-Poissonity of subhalo occupation statistics does not vanish by selecting
haloes with fixed mass and fixed formation redshift. Finally, we use subhalo
occupation statistics to put loose constraints on the mass and formation
redshift of the Milky Way halo. Using observational constraints on the V_max of
the most massive satellites, we infer that 0.25<M_vir/10^12M_sun/h<1.4 and
0.1<z_f<1.4 at 90% confidence.

standard methods in radio interferometry for reconstructing images, such as
CLEAN, have served the community well over the last few decades and have
survived largely because they are pragmatic. However, they produce
reconstructed inter\-ferometric images that are limited in quality and

saving and an analytic form. Second, we apply PURIFY to real interferometric

of the outburst. However, it is unclear how molecules and grains are able to
condense within the ejecta, given the potentially harsh environment created by
ionizing radiation from the white dwarf. Motivated by the evidence for powerful
radiative shocks within nova outflows, we propose that dust formation occurs
within the cool, dense shell behind these shocks. We incorporate a simple
molecular chemistry network and classical nucleation theory with a model for
the thermodynamic evolution of the post-shock gas, in order to demonstrate the
formation of both carbon and forsterite ($\rm Mg_2SiO_4$) grains. The high
densities due to radiative shock compression ($n \sim 10^{14}$ cm$^{-3}$)
result in CO saturation and rapid dust nucleation. Grains grow efficiently to
large sizes $\gtrsim 0.1\mu$m, in agreement with IR observations of
dust-producing novae, and with total dust masses sufficient to explain massive
extinction events such as V705 Cas. As in dense stellar winds, dust formation
is CO-regulated, with carbon-rich flows producing carbon-rich grains and
oxygen-rich flows primarily forming silicates. CO is destroyed by non-thermal
particles accelerated at the shock, allowing additional grain formation at late
times, but the efficiency of this process appears to be low. Given observations
showing that individual novae produce both carbonaceous and silicate grains, we
concur with previous works attributing this bimodality to chemical
heterogeneity of the ejecta. Nova outflows are diverse and inhomogeneous, and
the observed variety of dust formation events can be reconciled by different
abundances, the range of shock properties, and the observer viewing angle. The
latter may govern the magnitude of extinction, with the deepest extinction
events occurring for observers within the binary equatorial plane.

galactic nuclei (AGN) but reproduce well the observed relations between stellar
and halo mass and between stellar mass and SFR. About half (a third) of the
simulated massive galaxies (massive central galaxies) at z~2 have broad-band
colours classifying them as 'quiescent', and the fraction of quiescent centrals
is steeply decreasing towards higher redshift, in agreement with observations.
The progenitors of z~2 quiescent central galaxies are, on average, more
massive, have lower specific SFRs, and reside in more massive haloes than the
progenitors of similarly massive star forming centrals. The simulations further
predict a morphological mix of galaxies that includes disk-dominated,
irregular, and early-type galaxies. However, our simulations do not reproduce
the reddest of the quiescent galaxies observed at z~2. We also do not find
evidence for a colour bimodality, but are limited by our modest sample size. In
our simulations, the star formation activity of central galaxies of moderate
mass (Mstar~10^10-10^11 Msun) is affected by a combination of two distinct
physical processes. Outflows powered by stellar feedback result in a
short-lived (<100 Myr), but almost complete, suppression of star formation
activity after which many galaxies quickly recover and continue to form stars
at normal rates. In addition, galaxies residing in slowly growing haloes tend
to experience a moderate reduction of their SFRs ('cosmological starvation').
The relative importance of these processes and AGN feedback is uncertain and
will be explored in future work.

concentration fields of the system at hand. Systems with shorter-range
correlation and/or smaller concentration variance require more particles,
potentially limiting the computational feasibility of the method. For the
well-known problem of bimolecular reaction, we show that using kernel-based,
rather than Dirac-delta, particles can significantly reduce the required number
of particles. We derive the fixed width of a Gaussian kernel for a given
reduced number of particles that analytically eliminates the error between
kernel and Dirac solutions at any specified time. We also show how to solve for
the fixed kernel size by minimizing the squared differences between solutions
over any given time interval. Numerical results show that the width of the
kernel should be kept below about 12% of the domain size, and that the analytic
equations used to derive kernel width suffer significantly from the neglect of
higher-order moments. The simulations with a kernel width given by least
squares minimization perform better than those made to match at one specific
time. A heuristic time-variable kernel size, based on the previous results,
performs on a par with the least squares fixed kernel size.

Our main contribution is to assess in a cosmological framework, the empirically
derived non-parametric demarcation line and average time-scales used to
determine the merger rate observationally. We found that 98 per cent of
galaxies above the demarcation line have a close companion or have experienced
a recent merger event. On average, merger signatures obtained from the
$G-M_{20}$ criteria anticorrelate clearly with the elapsing time to the last
merger event. We also find that the asymmetry correlates with galaxy pair
separation and relative velocity, exhibiting the larger enhancements for those
systems with pair separations $d < 50$ h$^{-1}$ kpc and relative velocities $V
< 350$ km s$^{-1}$. We find that the $G-M_{20}$ is most sensitive to recent
mergers ($\sim0.14$ Gyr) and to ongoing mergers with stellar mass ratios
greater than 0.1. For this indicator, we compute a merger average observability
time-scale of $\sim0.2$ Gyr, in agreement with previous results and demonstrate

principle which has been used in a variety of combinatorial constructions.
While originally a general statement about probability spaces, it has recently
been transformed into a variety of polynomial-time algorithms. The resampling
algorithm of Moser & Tardos (2010) is the most well-known example of this. A
variety of criteria have been shown for the LLLL; the strongest possible
criterion was shown by Shearer, and other criteria which are easier to use
computationally have been shown by Bissacot et al (2011), Pegden (2014),
Kolipaka & Szegedy (2011), and Kolipaka, Szegedy, Xu (2012).
  We show a new criterion for the Moser-Tardos algorithm to converge. This
criterion is stronger than the LLLL criterion; this is possible because it does
not apply in the same generality as the original LLLL; yet, it is strong enough
to cover many applications of the LLLL in combinatorics. We show a variety of
new bounds and algorithms. A noteworthy application is for $k$-SAT, with
bounded occurrences of variables. As shown in Gebauer, Sz\'{a}bo, and Tardos
(2011), a $k$-SAT instance in which every variable appears $L \leq
\frac{2^{k+1}}{e (k+1)}$ times, is satisfiable. Although this bound is
asymptotically tight (in $k$), we improve it to $L \leq \frac{2^{k+1} (1 -
1/k)^k}{k-1} - \frac{2}{k}$ which can be significantly stronger when $k$ is
small.
  We introduce a new parallel algorithm for the LLLL. While Moser & Tardos
described a simple parallel algorithm for the Lov\'{a}sz Local Lemma, and
described a simple sequential algorithm for a form of the Lopsided Lemma, they
were not able to combine the two. Our new algorithm applies in nearly all
settings in which the sequential algorithm works --- this includes settings
covered by our new stronger LLLL criterion.

BS that decodes a list of diverse outputs by optimizing for a
diversity-augmented objective. We observe that our method finds better top-1
solutions by controlling for the exploration and exploitation of the search

are achieved with minimal computational or memory over- head as compared to

results on image captioning, machine translation and visual question generation

There is a natural ""approximate"" Einstein metric on the desingularization of

the first obstruction to perturbing this approximate Einstein metric to an

examples of Einstein orbifolds which do not admit any Einstein metric in a

Einstein and non-degenerate, we show that if the first obstruction vanishes,

network, nodes represent the agents and edges represent communication links

the followers only exchange information with their neighbors. The reduced
network is obtained by partitioning the set of nodes into disjoint sets, called
clusters, and associating with each cluster a single, new, node in a reduced
network graph. The resulting reduced network has a weighted, symmetric,
directed network graph, and inherits some of the structure of the original
network. We establish a priori upper bounds on the $\mathcal{H}_2$ and
$\mathcal{H}_\infty$ model reduction error for the special case that the graph
partition is almost equitable. These upper bounds depend on the Laplacian
eigenvalues of the original and reduced network, an auxiliary system associated
with the agent dynamics, and the number of nodes that belong to the same
clusters as the leaders in the network. Finally, we consider the problem of
obtaining a priori upper bounds if we cluster using arbitrary, possibly non

of three vortex-lattice states at different vortex densities and we
characterize the phase transitions from these phases into neighboring states.
Furthermore, we provide an intuitive explanation of the chiral-current reversal

the system parameters, this state can transition into a completely gapped
vortex-lattice Mott-insulating state. We elucidate the stability of these

charge-density-wave state at 1/3 particle filling can be stabilized for flux
values close to half a flux-quantum and for very strong on-site interactions in
the presence of strong repulsion on the rungs. Finally, we analytically
describe the emergence of these phases in the low-density regime, and, in

in modern day statistics with numerous applications. In these high dimensional
datasets, the number of variables p is typically larger than the sample size n.
A popular way of tackling this challenge is to induce sparsity in the
covariance matrix, its inverse or a relevant transformation. In particular,
methods inducing sparsity in the Cholesky pa- rameter of the inverse covariance
matrix can be useful as they are guaranteed to give a positive definite
estimate of the covariance matrix. Also, the estimated sparsity pattern
corresponds to a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) model for Gaussian data. In
recent years, two useful penalized likelihood methods for sparse estimation of
this Cholesky parameter (with no restrictions on the sparsity pattern) have
been developed. How- ever, these methods either consider a non-convex
optimization problem which can lead to convergence issues and singular
estimates of the covariance matrix when p > n, or achieve a convex formulation
by placing a strict constraint on the conditional variance parameters. In this
paper, we propose a new penalized likelihood method for sparse estimation of
the inverse covariance Cholesky parameter that aims to overcome some of the
shortcomings of current methods, but retains their respective strengths. We ob-
tain a jointly convex formulation for our objective function, which leads to
convergence guarantees, even when p > n. The approach always leads to a
positive definite and symmetric estimator of the covariance matrix. We
establish high-dimensional estima- tion and graph selection consistency, and
also demonstrate finite sample performance on simulated/real data.

regulatory efficiency usually depends strongly on the emergence of stable

genetic repressilators coupled by an additional plasmid which implements quorum
sensing (QS) in each network thereby supporting global coupling. In a basic
genetic ring oscillator network in which three genes inhibit each other in
unidirectional manner, QS stimulates the transcriptional activity of chosen
genes providing for competition between inhibitory and stimulatory activities
localized in those genes. The ""promoter strength"", the Hill cooperativity
coefficient of transcription repression, and the coupling strength, i.e.,
parameters controlling the basic rates of genetic reactions, were chosen for
extensive bifurcation analysis. The results are presented as a map of dynamic
regimes. We found that the remarkable multistability of the anti-phase limit
cycle and stable homogeneous and inhomogeneous steady states exists over broad
ranges of control parameters. We studied the anti-phase limit cycle stability
and the evolution of irregular oscillatory regimes in the parameter areas where
the anti-phase cycle loses stability. In these regions we observed developing
complex oscillations, collective chaos, and multistability between regular
limit cycles and complex oscillations over uncommonly large intervals of
coupling strength. QS-coupling stimulates the appearance of intrachaotic
periodic windows with spatially symmetric and asymmetric partial limit cycles

into chaos composed of pieces of the trajectories having alternating polarity.

component of models for continuously-indexed spatial data is the covariance
function, which is traditionally assumed to belong to a parametric class of
stationary models. While convenient, the assumption of stationarity is rarely
realistic; as a result, there is a rich literature on alternative methodologies
which capture and model the nonstationarity present in most environmental
processes. This review document provides a rigorous and concise description of

in modern science and philosophy. Several conceptions such as weak, strong and
robust emergence have been proposed to emphasize different epistemological and
ontological aspects of the problem. One of the most important concerns is
whether emergence is an intrinsic property of the reality we observe, or it is
rather a consequence of epistemological limitations. To elucidate this
question, we propose a novel approximation through constructive topology, a
framework that allow us to map the space of observed objects (ontology) with
the knowledge subject conceptual apparatus (epistemology). Focusing in a
particular type of emergent processes, namely those accessible through
experiments and from which we have still no clue on the mechanistic processes
yielding its formation, we analyse how a knowledge subject would build a
conceptual explanatory framework. Working on these systems, we identify concept
disjunction as a critical logical operation needed to identify the constraints
of the system. Next, focusing on a three-bits synthetic system, we show how the
number and scope of the constraints hinder the development of such scheme.
Interestingly, we observe that our framework is unable to identify global
constraints, clearly linking the epistemological limits of the framework with
an ontological feature of the system. This allows us to propose a definition of
emergence strength which we make compatible with the scientific method through
the active intervention of the observer on the system. We think that this
definition reconciles previous attempts to classify emergent processes, at
least for the specific kind we discuss here. The paper finishes discussing the
relevance of global constraints in biological systems, understood as a downward
causal influence exerted by natural selection.

high expectations that it can be used in spintronic devices. Yet, despite the
tremendous amount of work devoted to preparing thin films, the enigmatic first

Verwey transition, is in thin films extremely broad and occurs at substantially

Here we have succeeded in finding and making a particular class of substrates

two major light-echo components. The first one exhibits a filled ring structure
with position-angle-dependent intensity. This radially extended, diffuse echo
indicates the presence of an inhomogeneous interstellar dust cloud ranging from
~100 pc to ~500 pc in the foreground of the SN. The second echo component
appears as an unresolved luminous quarter-circle arc centered on the SN. The
wavelength dependence of scattering measured in different dust components
suggests that the dust producing the luminous arc favors smaller grain sizes,
while that causing the diffuse light echo may have sizes similar to those of
the Milky Way dust. Smaller grains can produce an optical depth consistent with
that along the supernova-Earth line of sight measured by previous studies
around maximum light. Therefore, it is possible that the dust slab, from which
the luminous arc arises, is also responsible for most of the extinction towards

functions on modular semilattices and L-convex functions on oriented modular
graphs. They were introduced by the author in complexity classification of
minimum 0-extension problems. We clarify the relationship to other discrete
convex functions, such as $k$-submodular functions, skew-bisubmodular
functions, L$^\natural$-convex functions, tree submodular functions, and
UJ-convex functions. We show that they are actually viewed as
submodular/L-convex functions in our sense. We also prove a sharp iteration
bound of the steepest descent algorithm for minimizing our L-convex functions.
The underlying structures, modular semilattices and oriented modular graphs,
have rich connections to projective and polar spaces, Euclidean building, and
metric spaces of global nonpositive curvature (CAT(0) spaces). By utilizing
these connections, we formulate an analogue of the Lov\'asz extension,
introduce well-behaved subclasses of submodular/L-convex functions, and show
that these classes can be characterized by the convexity of the Lov\'asz
extension. We demonstrate applications of our theory to combinatorial
optimization problems that include multicommodity flow, multiway cut, and
related labeling problems: these problems have been outside the scope of
discrete convex analysis so far.

handle some data uncertainties directly, and type-2 fuzzy sets (T2 FSs) can
cover the shortcoming of T1 FSs to a certain extent. Fuzzy discrete event
systems (FDESs) were proposed based on T1 FSs theory. Hence, FDES may not be a
satisfactory model to characterize some high-uncertainty systems. In this
paper, we propose a new model, called as bi-fuzzy discrete event systems
(BFDESs), by combining classical DESs theory and T2 FSs theory. Then, we
consider the supervisory control problem of BFDESs. The bi-fuzzy
controllability theorem and nonblocking bi-fuzzy controllability theorem are
demonstrated. Also, an algorithm for checking the bi-fuzzy controllability
condition is presented. In addition, two controllable approximations to an
uncontrollable language are investigated in detail. An illustrative example is
provided to show the applicability and the advantages of BFDESs model.

discussion of the technical aspects of musical composition, and it can be read
by someone with no formal knowledge of music. The focus here is on what the
process of composing this particular piece of music says about how the creative
process works. My interpretation of the music-making process may be biased by
my academic view of creativity, but I believe that the influence works
primarily in the other direction, my understanding of how the creative process
works is derived from experiences creating. This intuitive understanding is
shaped over time by the process of reading scholarly papers on creativity and
working them into my own evolving theory of creativity, but the papers that I
resonate with and incorporate are those that are in line with my experience.
This chapter just makes the influence of personal experience more explicit than
in other more scholarly writings on creativity.

We perform complete quantum state tomography for each state and compute state

  Cahn-Hilliard Equation and its Convergence Analysis","24 pages, 5 figures, 1 Table",,,,"math.NA","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We present and analyze an unconditionally energy stable and convergent finite
difference scheme for the Functionalized Cahn-Hilliard equation. One key
difficulty associated with the energy stability is based on the fact that one
nonlinear energy functional term in the expansion appears as non-convex,
non-concave. To overcome this subtle difficulty, we add two auxiliary terms to
make the combined term convex, which in turns yields a convex-concave
decomposition of the physical energy. As a result, an application of the convex
splitting methodology assures both the unique solvability and the unconditional
energy stability of the proposed numerical scheme. To deal with a 4-Laplacian
solver in an $H^{-1}$ gradient flow at each time step, we apply an efficient
preconditioned steepest descent algorithm to solve the corresponding nonlinear
systems. In addition, a global in time $H_{\rm per}^2$ stability of the
numerical scheme is established at a theoretical level, which in turn ensures
the full order convergence analysis of the scheme. A few numerical results are
presented, which confirm the stability and accuracy of the proposed numerical
scheme.

chosen impedance ratio, SIRs can be 27% shorter than UIRs. As a result, the
area occupied by SIRs can be reduced. Two kinds of designs containing both SIRs
and UIRs are fabricated and measured. The power dependence of the extracted
internal quality factors (Qi) for all the resonators showed that SIRs and UIRs
have comparable performance with Qi around half-million under single-photon

superconducting quantum circuits. The reduced size of SIRs may also lead to
reduced overall circuit area and increased integration level.

that uses a hierarchically clustered scale free network to generate music that
ranges from orderly to chaotic. NW was inspired by the Honing Theory of
creativity, according to which human-like creativity hinges on (1) the ability
to self-organize and maintain dynamics at the 'edge of chaos' using something
akin to 'psychological entropy', and (2) the capacity to shift between analytic
and associative processing modes. At the 'edge of chaos', NW generates patterns
that exhibit emergent complexity through coherent development at low, mid, and
high levels of musical organization, and often suggests goal seeking behaviour.
The architecture consists of four 16-node modules: one each for pitch,
velocity, duration, and entry delay. The Core allows users to define how nodes
are connected, and rules that determine when and how nodes respond to their
inputs. The Mapping Layer allows users to map node output values to MIDI data
that is routed to software instruments in a digital audio workstation. By
shifting between bottom-up and top-down NW shifts between analytic and
associative processing modes.

symptoms. The memory can distinguish a single infection from a polyinfection.
Our model is a combination of the improved versions of the original linear
quantum retrieving algorithm proposed by Ventura and the non-linear quantum
search algorithm of Abrams and Lloyd. From the given simulation results, it
appears that the efficiency of recognition is good when particular signs and
symptoms of a disease are inserted given that the linear algorithm is the main
algorithm. The non-linear algorithm helps confirm or correct the diagnosis or
give some advice to the medical staff for the treatment. So, our QAMDiagnos
that has a friendly graphical user interface for desktop and smart-phone is a
sensitive and a low-cost diagnostic tool that enables rapid and accurate
diagnosis of four tropical diseases.

crystallizes in three symmetries, the semiconducting trigonal-prismatic
$2H-$phase, the semimetallic $1T^{\prime}$ monoclinic phase, and the
semimetallic orthorhombic $T_d$ structure. The $2H-$phase displays a band gap
of $\sim 1$ eV making it appealing for flexible and transparent
optoelectronics. The $T_d-$phase is predicted to possess unique topological
properties which might lead to topologically protected non-dissipative
transport channels. Recently, it was argued that it is possible to locally
induce phase-transformations in TMDs, through chemical doping, local heating,
or electric-field to achieve ohmic contacts or to induce useful functionalities
such as electronic phase-change memory elements. The combination of
semiconducting and topological elements based upon the same compound, might
produce a new generation of high performance, low dissipation optoelectronic
elements. Here, we show that it is possible to engineer the phases of MoTe$_2$
through W substitution by unveiling the phase-diagram of the
Mo$_{1-x}$W$_x$Te$_2$ solid solution which displays a semiconducting to
semimetallic transition as a function of $x$. We find that only $\sim 8$ \% of
W stabilizes the $T_d-$phase at room temperature. Photoemission spectroscopy,
indicates that this phase possesses a Fermi surface akin to that of WTe$_2$.

application. In some application scenarios, only sub-Nyquist samples are
available to estimate the frequencies. A conventional approach is to sample the
signals at several lower rates. In this paper, we address frequency estimation
of the signals in the time domain through undersampled data. We analyze the
impact of undersampling and demonstrate that three sub-Nyquist channels are
generally enough to estimate the frequencies provided the undersampling ratios
are pairwise coprime. We deduce the condition that leads to the failure of
resolving frequency ambiguity when two coprime undersampling channels are
utilized. When three-channel sub-Nyquist samples are used jointly, the
frequencies can be determined uniquely and the correct frequencies are
estimated. Numerical experiments verify the correctness of our analysis and
conclusion.

critical problem in precision agriculture. While Structure from Motion and
Multi-View Stereo algorithms can finely reconstruct the 3D structure of a field
with low-cost image sensors, these algorithms fail to capture the dynamic
nature of continuously growing crops. In this paper we propose a 4D
reconstruction approach to crop monitoring, which employs a spatio-temporal
model of dynamic scenes that is useful for precision agriculture applications.
Additionally, we provide a robust data association algorithm to address the
problem of large appearance changes due to scenes being viewed from different
angles at different points in time, which is critical to achieving 4D
reconstruction. Finally, we collected a high quality dataset with ground truth
statistics to evaluate the performance of our method. We demonstrate that our
4D reconstruction approach provides models that are qualitatively correct with
respect to visual appearance and quantitatively accurate when measured against
the ground truth geometric properties of the monitored crops.

  (2017)",,,"q-bio.NC physics.soc-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  This paper proposes a theory of creativity, referred to as honing theory,
which posits that creativity fuels the process by which culture evolves through
communal exchange amongst minds that are self-organizing, self-maintaining, and
self-reproducing. According to honing theory, minds, like other selforganizing
systems, modify their contents and adapt to their environments to minimize
entropy. Creativity begins with detection of high psychological entropy
material, which provokes uncertainty and is arousalinducing. The creative
process involves recursively considering this material from new contexts until
it is sufficiently restructured that arousal dissipates. Restructuring involves
neural synchrony and dynamic binding, and may be facilitated by temporarily
shifting to a more associative mode of thought. A creative work may similarly
induce restructuring in others, and thereby contribute to the cultural
evolution of more nuanced worldviews. Since lines of cultural descent
connecting creative outputs may exhibit little continuity, it is proposed that
cultural evolution occurs at the level of self-organizing minds, outputs
reflect their evolutionary state. Honing theory addresses challenges not
addressed by other theories of creativity, such as the factors that guide
restructuring, and in what sense creative works evolve. Evidence comes from
empirical studies, an agent-based computational model of cultural evolution,
and a model of concept combination.

luminosities in groups are randomly drawn from an underlying luminosity
function. We show that even the simplest of such order statistics models -- one
in which this luminosity function $p(L)$ is universal -- naturally produces a
number of features associated with previous analyses based on the `central plus
Poisson satellites' hypothesis. These include the monotonic relation of mean
central luminosity with halo mass, the Lognormal distribution around this mean,
and the tight relation between the central and satellite mass scales. In stark
contrast to observations of galaxy clustering, however, this model predicts
$\textit{no}$ luminosity dependence of large scale clustering. We then show
that an extended version of this model, based on the order statistics of a
$\textit{halo mass dependent}$ luminosity function $p(L|m)$, is in much better
agreement with the clustering data as well as satellite luminosities, but
systematically under-predicts central luminosities. This brings into focus the
idea that central galaxies constitute a distinct population that is affected by
different physical processes than are the satellites. We model this physical
difference as a statistical brightening of the central luminosities, over and
above the order statistics prediction. The magnitude gap between the brightest
and second brightest group galaxy is predicted as a by-product, and is also in
good agreement with observations. We propose that this order statistics
framework provides a useful language in which to compare the Halo Model for
galaxies with more physically motivated galaxy formation models

increases with the increase in frequency due to dipole response to the

existing GPU-based LDA systems cannot support a large number of topics because
they use algorithms on dense data structures whose time and space complexity is
linear to the number of topics. In this paper, we propose SaberLDA, a GPU-based

challenges introduced by sparsity, we propose a novel data layout, a new
warp-based sampling kernel, and an efficient sparse count matrix updating
algorithm that improves locality, makes efficient utilization of GPU warps, and
reduces memory consumption. Experiments show that SaberLDA can learn from
billions-token-scale data with up to 10,000 topics, which is almost two orders
of magnitude larger than that of the previous GPU-based systems. With a single
GPU card, SaberLDA is able to learn 10,000 topics from a dataset of billions of

stage followed by one or more reranking stages. In such an architecture, the
quality of the final ranked list may not be sensitive to the quality of initial
candidate pool, especially in terms of early precision. This provides several
opportunities to increase retrieval efficiency without significantly
sacrificing effectiveness. In this paper, we explore a new approach to
dynamically predicting two different parameters in the candidate generation
stage which can directly affect the overall efficiency and effectiveness of the
entire system. Previous work exploring this tradeoff has focused on global
parameter settings that apply to all queries, even though optimal settings vary
across queries. In contrast, we propose a technique which makes a parameter
prediction that maximizes efficiency within a effectiveness envelope on a per
query basis, using only static pre-retrieval features. The query-specific
tradeoff point between effectiveness and efficiency is decided using a
classifier cascade that weighs possible efficiency gains against effectiveness
losses over a range of possible parameter cutoffs to make the prediction. The
interesting twist in our new approach is to train classifiers without requiring
explicit relevance judgments. We show that our framework is generalizable by
applying it to two different retrieval parameters - selecting k in common top-k
query retrieval algorithms, and setting a quality threshold, $\rho$, for
score-at-a-time approximate query evaluation algorithms. Experimental results
show that substantial efficiency gains are achievable depending on the dynamic
parameter choice. In addition, our framework provides a versatile tool that can
be used to estimate the effectiveness-efficiency tradeoffs that are possible
before selecting and tuning algorithms to make machine learned predictions.

using all the Bell type entangled non-orthogonal states known as quasi Bell
states. Using Horodecki criterion, it is shown that the teleportation scheme
obtained by replacing the quantum channel (Bell state) of the usual
teleportation scheme by a quasi Bell state is optimal. Further, the performance
of various quasi Bell states as teleportation channel is compared in an ideal
situation (i.e., in the absence of noise) and under different noise models
(e.g., amplitude and phase damping channels). It is observed that the best
choice of the quasi Bell state depends on the amount non-orthogonality, both in
noisy and noiseless case. A specific quasi Bell state, which was found to be
maximally entangled in the ideal conditions, is shown to be less efficient as a
teleportation channel compared to other quasi Bell states in particular cases
when subjected to noisy channels. It has also been observed that usually the

is not constant but piecewise constant. Following Andersen and Gill (1982), we
know that a knowledge of the changepoint leads to a relatively straightforward
estimation of the regression coefficients on either side of the changepoint.
Between adjacent changepoints, we place ourselves under the proportional
hazards model. We can then maximize the partial likelihood to obtain a
consistent estimation of the regression coefficients. Difficulties occur when
we want to estimate these changepoints. We obtain a confidence region for the
changepoint, under a two-step regression model (Anderson and Senthilselvan,
1982), based on the work of Davies (1977). Then we introduce a new estimation
method using the standardized score process (Chauvel and O'Quigley, 2014),
under a model with multiple changepoints. In this context, rather than make use
of the partial likelihood, we base inference on minimization of quadratic
residuals. Simulations and an example are provided.

improves coding efficiency over its previous video coding standards. The
expense of such improvement is enormous computational complexity, from both
encoding and decoding sides. Since computational capability and power capacity
are diverse across portable devices, it is necessary to reduce decoding
complexity to a target with tolerable quality loss, so called complexity
control. This paper proposes a Saliency-Guided Complexity Control (SGCC)
approach for HEVC decoding, which reduces the decoding complexity to the target
with minimal perceptual quality loss. First, we establish the SGCC formulation
to minimize perceptual quality loss at the constraint on reduced decoding
complexity, which is achieved via disabling Deblocking Filter (DF) and
simplifying Motion Compensation (MC) of some non-salient Coding Tree Units
(CTUs). One important component in this formulation is the modelled
relationship between decoding complexity reduction and DF disabling/MC
simplification, which determines the control accuracy of our approach. Another
component is the modelled relationship between quality loss and DF disabling/MC
simplification, responsible for optimizing perceptual quality. By solving the
SGCC formulation for a given target complexity, we can obtain the DF and MC
settings of each CTU, and then decoding complexity can be reduced to the
target. Finally, the experimental results validate the effectiveness of our
SGCC approach, from the aspects of control performance, complexity-distortion
performance, fluctuation of quality loss and subjective quality.

management. Building a reliable effort estimation model usually requires
historical data. Unfortunately, since the information available at early stages
of software development is scarce, it is recommended to use software size
metrics as key cost factor of effort estimation. Use Case Points (UCP) is a
prominent size measure designed mainly for object-oriented projects.
Nevertheless, there are no established models that can translate UCP into its
corresponding effort, therefore, most models use productivity as a second cost
driver. The productivity in those models is usually guessed by experts and does
not depend on historical data, which makes it subject to uncertainty. Thus,
these models were not well examined using a large number of historical data. In
this paper, we designed a hybrid model that consists of classification and
prediction stages using a support vector machine and radial basis neural
networks. The proposed model was constructed over a large number of
observations collected from industrial and student projects. The proposed model
was compared against previous UCP prediction models. The validation and
empirical results demonstrated that the proposed model significantly surpasses
these models on all datasets. The main conclusion is that the environmental
factors of UCP can be used to classify and estimate productivity.

bound on ${\bf Adv}_{n, m} (q)$ that confirms the conjecture for $m < n/7$, and
also declared a general lower bound ${\bf Adv}_{n,m}(q)=\Omega(q^2/2^{n+m})$.
The conjecture was essentially confirmed by Bellare and Impagliazzo (1999).
Nevertheless, the problem of {\em estimating} ${\bf Adv}_{n, m} (q)$ remained
open. Combining the trivial bound $1$, the birthday bound, and a result of Stam
(1978) leads to the upper bound \begin{equation*} {\bf Adv}_{n,m}(q) =
O\left(\min\left\{\frac{q(q-1)}{2^n},\,\frac{q}{2^{\frac{n+m}{2}}},\,1\right\}\right).

the reflectance for the individual channels and the Lyapunov exponent for the

parameter $\rho$ is smaller than the interchain coupling parameter $t_{v}$, the
transmittance and the reflectance are periodic functions of the system size,
whereas when $\rho$ is larger than $t_{v}$, the transmittance is found to be an
exponentially-decaying function while the reflectance attains a saturation
value in the thermodynamic limit. For a fixed system size, there appear perfect
transmission resonances in each individual channel at several values of the
gain/loss strength smaller than $t_{v}$. A singular behavior of the
transmittance is also found to appear at various values of $\rho$ for a given
system size. When disorder is inserted into the on-site potentials, these
behaviors are changed substantially due to the interplay between disorder and
the gain/loss effect. When $\rho$ is smaller than $t_{v}$, we find that the
presence of locally $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric potentials suppresses Anderson
localization, as compared to the localization in the corresponding Hermitian
system. When $\rho$ is larger than $t_{v}$, we find that localization becomes
more pronounced at higher gain/loss strengths. We also find that the phenomenon
of anomalous localization occurs in disordered locally $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric
systems precisely at the spectral positions $E=0$ and
$E=\pm\sqrt{t_{v}^2-\rho^2}$. The anomaly at the band center manifests as a

length are calculated in a numerically precise manner. The localization length
is found to be a nonmonotonic function of the incident wave intensity,
acquiring a minimum value at a certain finite intensity, due to saturation
effects. For low incident intensities where the saturation effect is
ineffective, the enhancement of localization due to Kerr-type nonlinearity
occurs in a way similar to the case without saturation. For sufficiently high
incident intensities, we find that the localization length is an increasing
function of the incident wave intensity, which implies that localization is
suppressed for stronger input intensities, and ultimately approaches a
saturation value. This feature is associated with the fact that the nonlinear
system is reduced to an effectively linear one, when either the incident wave
intensity or the saturation parameter is sufficiently large. We also find that
the nonlinear saturation effect is stronger and more pronounced when the energy
of the incident wave is larger.

methods for sorting quantum states with different OAM values, the
nondestructive and efficient sorter of high-dimensional OAM remains a
fundamental challenge. Here, we propose a scalable OAM sorter which can
categorize different OAM states simultaneously, meanwhile, preserving both OAM
and spin angular momentum. Fundamental elements of the sorter are composed of
symmetric multiport beam splitters (BSs) and Dove prisms with cascading
structure, which in principle can be flexibly and effectively combined to sort
arbitrarily high-dimensional OAM photons. The scalable structures proposed here
greatly reduce the number of BSs required for sorting high-dimensional
OAMstates. In view of the nondestructive and extensible features, the sorters
can be used as fundamental devices not only for high-dimensional quantum
information processing, but also for traditional optics.

  A motivating example arises when we keep the training data locally on users'
mobile devices instead of logging it to a data center for training. In
federated optimziation, the devices are used as compute nodes performing
computation on their local data in order to update a global model. We suppose
that we have extremely large number of devices in the network --- as many as
the number of users of a given service, each of which has only a tiny fraction
of the total data available. In particular, we expect the number of data points
available locally to be much smaller than the number of devices. Additionally,
since different users generate data with different patterns, it is reasonable
to assume that no device has a representative sample of the overall

of coupled regions or cities that the recurrent epidemics in two coupled

outbreak phase where outbreaks occur in one network but do not in another one.
To reveal the underlying mechanism, we present a two-layered network model of
coupled recurrent epidemics to reproduce the synchronized and mixed outbreak
phases. We show that the synchronized outbreak phase is preferred to be
triggered in two coupled networks with the same average degree while the mixed
outbreak phase is preferred for the case with different average degrees.
Further, we show that the coupling between the two layers is preferred to
suppress the mixed outbreak phase but enhance the synchronized outbreak phase.
A theoretical analysis based on microscopic Markov-chain approach is presented

other cases apart from the radiation domination case, and we discuss how the
baryon-to-entropy ratio is affected from the parameters of the quantum theory.
In addition, we use illustrative exact solutions of Loop Quantum Cosmology and
we investigate under which circumstances the baryon-to-entropy ratio can be

range needed to fully resolve the build-up of individual stars and star
clusters, and thus have to resort to subgrid models. A popular way to do this
is by introducing Lagrangian sink particles, which replace contracting high
density regions at the point where the resolution limit is reached. A common
problem then is how to assign fundamental stellar properties to sink particles,
such as the distribution of stellar masses.
  We present a new and simple statistical method to assign stellar contents to
sink particles. Once the stellar content is specified, it can be used to
determine a sink particle's radiative output, supernovae rate or other feedback
parameters that may be required in the calculations. Advantages of our method
are (i) it is simple to implement, (ii) it guarantees that the obtained stellar
populations are good samples of the initial mass function, (iii) it can easily
deal with infalling mass accreted at later times, and (iv) it does not put
restrictions on the sink particles' masses in order to be used. The method
works very well for sink particles that represent large star clusters and for
which the stellar mass function is well sampled, but can also handle the
transition to sink particles that represent a small number of stars.

immune to short-range and smooth long-range scatterers, can be engineered by

fundamental in gaining an understanding of brain function and disease. A number
of recent studies have investigated patterns of brain gene expression obtained
from an extensive anatomical coverage across the entire human brain using
experimental data generated by the Allen Human Brain Atlas (AHBA) project. In
this paper, we propose a new representation of a gene's transcription activity
that explicitly captures the pattern of spatial co-expression across different
anatomical brain regions. For each gene, we define a Spatial Expression Network
(SEN), a network quantifying co-expression patterns amongst several anatomical
locations. Network similarity measures are then employed to quantify the
topological resemblance between pairs of SENs and identify naturally occurring
clusters. Using network-theoretical measures, three large clusters have been
detected featuring distinct topological properties. We then evaluate whether
topological diversity of the SENs reflects significant differences in
biological function through a gene ontology analysis. We report on evidence
suggesting that one of the three SEN clusters consists of genes specifically
involved in the nervous system, including genes related to brain disorders,
while the remaining two clusters are representative of immunity, transcription
and translation. These findings are consistent with previous studies showing
that brain gene clusters are generally associated with one of these three major
biological processes.

spectroscopy can be tuned by changing the Ta thickness between $t$=0.25 nm, 0.5

for t=0.75 nm, the antiferromagnetic coupling needed to construct a synthetic

by tree-level, Feynman diagrams such as two gravitons turning into two photons

gravitational wave creates a massless, scalar field. This is done by placing
the scalar field in the background of a plane gravitational wave and
calculating the 4-current of the scalar field. Even in the vacuum limit of the
scalar field it has a non-zero vacuum expectation value (similar to what occurs
in the Higgs mechanism) and a non-zero current. We associate this with the
production of scalar field quanta by the gravitational field. This effect has
potential consequences for the attenuation of gravitational waves since the
massless field is being produced at the expense of the gravitational field.
This is related to the time-dependent Schwinger effect, but with the electric
field replaced by the the gravitational wave background and the
electron/positron field quanta replaced by massless scalar ""photons"". Since the
produced scalar quanta are massless there is no exponential suppression as
occurs in the Schwinger effect due to the electron mass.

$^{76}$Ge using arrays of high-purity germanium detectors. If observed, this
process would demonstrate that lepton number is not a conserved quantity in
nature, with implications for grand-unification and for explaining the
predominance of matter over antimatter in the universe. A problematic
background in such large granular detector arrays is posed by alpha particles.
In the Majorana Demonstrator, events have been observed that are consistent
with energy- degraded alphas originating on the passivated surface, leading to
a potential background contribution in the region-of-interest for neutrinoless
double-beta decay. However, it is also observed that when energy deposition
occurs very close to the passivated surface, charges drift through the bulk
onto that surface, and then drift along it with greatly reduced mobility. This
leads to both a reduced prompt signal and a measurable change in slope of the
tail of a recorded pulse. In this contribution we discuss the characteristics
of these events and the development of a filter that can identify the
occurrence of this delayed charge recovery, allowing for the efficient
rejection of passivated surface alpha events in analysis.

LHC. In particular, for particle identification via the time-of-flight
technique, the precise determination of the event collision time represents an
important ingredient of the quality of the measurement. In this paper, the
different methods used for such a measurement in ALICE by means of the T0 and
the TOF detectors are reviewed. Efficiencies, resolution and the improvement of
the particle identification separation power of the methods used are presented
for the different LHC colliding systems (pp , p-Pb and Pb-Pb) during the first
period of data taking of LHC (Run 1).

undertaken in the last two years: new spectral types, more objects, additional
information, and coordination with CDS. We also present updates for the
Galactic O-Star Spectroscopic Survey (GOSSS). A new paper (GOSSS-III) has been
published and ~1000 targets have been observed since 2014. Four new setups have
been added to our lineup and for two of them we have already obtained over 100
spectra: with OSIRIS at the 10.4 m GTC we are observing northern dim stars and
with FRODOspec at the 2.0 m Liverpool Telescope we are observing northern
bright stars. Finally, we also make available new versions of MGB, the spectral
classification tool associated with the project, and of the GOSSS grid of
spectroscopic standards.

compressible and charged fluid is derived. The viscosity effect is described by
the 4-potential of the energy dissipation field, dissipation tensor and
dissipation stress-energy tensor. In the weak field limit it is shown that the
obtained equation is equivalent to the Navier-Stokes equation. The equation for
the power of the kinetic energy loss is provided, the equation of motion is
integrated, and the dependence of the velocity magnitude is determined. A
complete set of equations is presented, which suffices to solve the problem of
motion of viscous compressible and charged fluid in the gravitational and
electromagnetic fields.
