parameters of gait from the last few steps before the obstacle and falling vs.
not falling; and the predictive capacity of a multivariate model in predicting
a fall in the presence of an unexpected obstacle. Homography transformations
correct the perspective projection distortion and allow for the consistent

at least one completion of a given set of partial votes for a specific voting
rule.
  The possible winner problem is well-known to be NP-complete in general, and
it is in fact known to be NP-complete for several voting rules where the number
of undetermined pairs in every vote is bounded only by some constant. In this
paper, we address the question of determining precisely the smallest number of
undetermined pairs for which the possible winner problem remains NP-complete.
In particular, we find the exact values of $t$ for which the possible winner
problem transitions to being NP-complete from being in P, where $t$ is the
maximum number of undetermined pairs in every vote. We demonstrate tight
results for a broad subclass of scoring rules which includes all the commonly
used scoring rules (such as plurality, veto, Borda, $k$-approval, and so on),
Copeland$^\alpha$ for every $\alpha\in[0,1]$, maximin, and Bucklin voting
rules. A somewhat surprising aspect of our results is that for many of these
rules, the possible winner problem turns out to be hard even if every vote has
at most one undetermined pair of candidates.

sentiment analysis), and one can only obtain answers of all tasks after the
last task is accomplished. As a consequence, the time delay of even one task in
this group could delay the next step of the task requester's work from minutes
to days, which is quite undesirable for the task requester.
  Inspired by the importance of the task accuracy and latency, in this paper,
we will propose a novel crowdsourcing framework, namely Fast and Reliable
crOwdsourcinG framework (FROG), which intelligently assigns tasks to workers,
such that the latencies of tasks are reduced and the expected accuracies of
tasks are met. Specifically, our FROG framework consists of two important
components, task scheduler and notification modules. For the task scheduler
module, we formalize a FROG task scheduling (FROG-TS) problem, in which the
server actively assigns workers with tasks with high reliability and low
latency. We prove that the FROG-TS problem is NP-hard. Thus, we design two
heuristic approaches, request-based and batch-based scheduling. For the
notification module, we define an efficient worker notifying (EWN) problem,
which only sends task invitations to those workers with high probabilities of
accepting the tasks. To tackle the EWN problem, we propose a smooth kernel
density estimation approach to estimate the probability that a worker accepts
the task invitation. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate the
effectiveness and efficiency of our proposed FROG platform on both real and
synthetic data sets.

multiple intermediate function evaluations per step, Adams family methods make
use of previous function evaluations, so that increased accuracy arising from a

the posterior mean and standard deviation over the numerical solution can be
made to exactly coincide with the value given by the deterministic method and
its local truncation error respectively. We provide a rigorous proof of the

high-energetic jets in the forward regions of the detector and reduced jet
activity in the central region. The higher center-of-mass energy during the

higher-order corrections, which are available at NLO QCD for all processes and
up to N3LO QCD and NLO electro-weak for VBF-H production. An additional
refinement is the addition of parton-shower effects, where recently a lot of
progress has been made. The appearance of triple and quartic gauge vertices in
the production processes enables us to probe anomalous gauge couplings. We

a grid of biomolecular sites on typical time scales less than 100 femtoseconds

described as an incoherent Forster hopping with classical site occupation
probabilities, but with quantum mechanically determined rate constants. This
orthodox picture has been challenged by ultrafast optical spectroscopy
experiments with the Fenna-Matthews-Olson protein in which interference
oscillatory signals up to 1.5 picoseconds were reported and interpreted as

we show that the optical 2D photon echo spectra of this complex at ambient

displacement (DLD) arrays. A DLD array can achieve high-resolution bimodal
size-based separation of microparticles, including bioparticles, such as cells.
For an application with a given separation size, correct device operation
requires that the flow remains at a fixed angle to the obstacle array. We
demonstrate via experiments and lattice-Boltzmann simulations that subtle array
design features cause anisotropic permeability. Anisotropic permeability
indicates the microfluidic array's intrinsic tendency to induce an undesired
lateral pressure gradient. This can cause an inclined flow and therefore local
changes in the critical separation size. Thus, particle trajectories can become
unpredictable and the device useless for the desired separation task.
Anisotropy becomes severe for arrays with unequal axial and lateral gaps
between obstacle posts and highly asymmetric post shapes. Furthermore, of the
two equivalent array layouts employed with the DLD, the rotated-square layout
does not display intrinsic anisotropy. We therefore recommend this layout over
the easier-to-implement parallelogram layout. We provide additional guidelines
for avoiding adverse effects of anisotropy on the DLD.

inflationary computations, an identification of the quantum constituents of the
inflationary background is made. In particular, the homogeneous scalar field
configuration is represented as a Bose-Einstein condensate of the off-shell
inflaton degrees of freedom, with mass significantly screened by the
gravitational binding energy. The gravitational counterpart of the classical
background is considered to be a degenerate state of the off-shell longitudinal
gravitons with the frequency of the order of the Hubble scale. As a result, the
origin of the density perturbations in the slow-roll regime is identified as an
uncertainty in the position of the constituent inflatons. While in the regime
of eternal inflation, the scattering of the constituent gravitons becomes the
relevant source of the density perturbations. The gravitational waves, on the
other hand, originate from the annihilation of the constituent longitudinal
gravitons at all energy scales. This results in the quantum depletion of the
classical background. Leading to the upper bound on the number of e-folds,
after which the semiclassical description is expected to break down, which is
estimated to be of the order of the entropy of the initial Hubble patch.

on the estimate of the region of attraction of synchronous states which is a
central problem in the transient stability of power grids. In the recent
literature, D\""{o}rfler, Chertkov, and Bullo [Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 110

heavily relies on these assumptions; however, they are too strict compared to

S has been substituted by Se and Te in polythiophene, leading to polyseleophene

pure polythiophene, polypyrrole and their derivatives leads to linear
suppression of the band gap or HOMO-LUMO gap as a function of the stacking.
Mixed bilayers, including one formed from polythiophene on top of polypyrrole,
have also been considered. Overall, a wide range of band gaps can be achieved
through substitutions and stacking. Hybrid (B3LYP) calculations also suggest
the same trend in the band gap as PBE calculations. Trends in the binding

blackbody temperatures in a range 61-91 eV for the continuum yielding a white

(sigma_v) 872 km/s and 56 km/s. These are consistent with shock temperatures in

present a versatile theory that combines Master equation with Maxwell relations

the intrinsic diffuseness of phase transitions and correlation characteristics.
Under increased electric fields, both EC entropy and adiabatic temperature
changes increase quadratically initially, followed by further linear growth and
eventual gradual saturation. The upper bound of entropy change (dS_max) is
limited by distinct correlation volumes (V_cr) and transition diffuseness. The

Furthermore, the VAR-HHMM algorithm, in some cases, achieved faster movement
onset detection compared with the offline standard. The proposed concept,

$WW$ and $\gamma\gamma$. This is the case even though top and bottom quarks
dominate the branching ratios, since their experimental sensitivity is not as
good as the one of the electro-weak gauge bosons. We find that as the graviton
mass increases, the $ZZ$ and $WW$ channels become more important because of its
relatively better enhancement over background, mainly due to fat jet
techniques. We determine the region of the parameter space that has already
been excluded and the reach for the LHC next stages. We also estimate the size
of the loop-induced contributions to the production and decay of the graviton,
and show in which region of the parameter space their effects are relevant for

assist, or even replace humans in many settings. These systems function by
learning from historical decisions, often taken by humans. In order to maximize
the utility of these systems (or, classifiers), their training involves
minimizing the errors (or, misclassifications) over the given historical data.
However, it is quite possible that the optimally trained classifier makes
decisions for people belonging to different social groups with different
misclassification rates (e.g., misclassification rates for females are higher
than for males), thereby placing these groups at an unfair disadvantage. To
account for and avoid such unfairness, in this paper, we introduce a new notion
of unfairness, disparate mistreatment, which is defined in terms of
misclassification rates. We then propose intuitive measures of disparate
mistreatment for decision boundary-based classifiers, which can be easily
incorporated into their formulation as convex-concave constraints. Experiments
on synthetic as well as real world datasets show that our methodology is
effective at avoiding disparate mistreatment, often at a small cost in terms of
accuracy.

to pay attention to specific regions and content of input documents with
attention models, but also distract them to traverse between different content
of a document so as to better grasp the overall meaning for summarization.
Without engineering any features, we train the models on two large datasets.

(GLM). Our approach combines the GLM with flexible graph-theoretic priors
governing the relationship between latent features and neural connectivity
patterns. Fully Bayesian inference via P\'olya-gamma augmentation of the
resulting model allows us to classify neurons and infer latent dimensions of
circuit organization from correlated spike trains. We demonstrate the
effectiveness of our method with applications to synthetic data and

have proven the existence of several transiting circumbinary planets. Albeit
light-curves from CoRoT have typically lower precision and shorter coverage,
CoRoT's number of targets is similar to Kepler, and some of the known
circumbinary planets could potentially be detected in CoRoT data as well. The
aim of this work has been a revision of the entire CoRoT data-set for the
presence of circumbinary planets, and the derivation of limits to the
abundances of such planets. We developed a code which removes the light curve
of the eclipsing binaries and searches for quasi-periodic transit-like features
in a light curve after removal of binary eclipses and instrumental features.
The code needs little information on the sample systems and can be used for
other space missions as well, like Kepler, K2, TESS and PLATO. The code is
broad in the requirements leading to detections, but was tuned to deliver an
amount of detections that is manageable in a subsequent, mainly visual,
revision about their nature. In the CoRoT sample we identified three planet
candidates whose transits would have arisen from a single pass across the
central binary. No candidates remained however with transit events from
multiple planetary orbits. We calculated the upper limits for the number of
Jupiter, Saturn and Neptune sized planets in co-planar orbits for different
orbital period ranges. We found that there are much less giant planets in
short-periodic orbits around close binary systems than around single stars.

results for the non-conserved, parity-breaking structures that appear in planar
three-point functions of the higher-spin operators. At large spin, we find that
the anomalous dimensions grow logarithmically with the spin, in agreement with
general expectations. This logarithmic behavior disappears in the strong
coupling limit, where the anomalous dimensions turn into those of the critical
O(N) or Gross-Neveu models, in agreement with the conjectured 3d bosonization
duality.

there is substantial interest in estimating global network properties from
smaller sub-samples. One of the most important global properties is the number
of vertices/nodes in the network. Estimating the number of vertices in a large
network is a major challenge in computer science, epidemiology, demography, and
intelligence analysis. In this paper we consider a population random graph G =
(V;E) from the stochastic block model (SBM) with K communities/blocks. A sample
is obtained by randomly choosing a subset W and letting G(W) be the induced
subgraph in G of the vertices in W. In addition to G(W), we observe the total
degree of each sampled vertex and its block membership. Given this partial
information, we propose an efficient PopULation Size Estimation algorithm,
called PULSE, that correctly estimates the size of the whole population as well
as the size of each community. To support our theoretical analysis, we perform
an exhaustive set of experiments to study the effects of sample size, K, and
SBM model parameters on the accuracy of the estimates. The experimental results
also demonstrate that PULSE significantly outperforms a widely-used method
called the network scale-up estimator in a wide variety of scenarios. We
conclude with extensions and directions for future work.

offering the benefits of both to programmers. Static typing provides error
detection and strong guarantees while dynamic typing enables rapid prototyping
and flexible programming idioms. For programmers to fully take advantage of a
gradual type system, however, they must be able to trust their type
annotations, and so runtime checks must be performed at the boundaries of
static and dynamic code to ensure that static types are respected. Higher order
and mutable values cannot be completely checked at these boundaries, and so
additional checks must be performed at their use sites. Traditionally, this has
been achieved by installing wrappers or proxies on such values that moderate
the flow of data between static and dynamic, but these can cause problems if
the language supports comparison of object identity or has a foreign function
interface.
  Reticulated Python is a gradually typed variant of Python implemented via a
source-to-source translator for Python 3. It implements a proxy-free
alternative design named transient casts. This paper presents a formal
semantics for transient casts and shows that not only are they sound, but they
work in an open-world setting in which the Reticulated translator has only been
applied to some of the program; the rest is untranslated Python. We formalize
this open world soundness property and use Coq to prove that it holds for

flights are comprised of a mix of long free-flights over several {\mu}m
interrupted by bursts of short flights, resulting in a heavy tailed
distribution of flight lengths, typically encountered in L\'{e}vy walk
dynamics. Consequently, phonon transport in Si-Ge NWs is neither entirely
ballistic nor diffusive; instead, it falls into an intermediate regime called
superdiffusion where thermal conductivity scales with the length of the NW as
$\kappa \propto L^{\alpha}$ with the exponent of length dependence
$\alpha\approx 0.33$ over a broad range of wire lengths 10 nm$<L<$10 $\mu$m

Interestingly, using these two kinds of models, we are able to realize almost

distinguish this background from the one of non-primordial massive binaries

conditional entropy of the source approaches to the channel rate. We also
evaluate the performance of our algorithms based on real-world experiments

strength of one user and its generated interference to neighboring base
stations, and balances the two. C&B has some highly attractive advantages: C&B
(i) can be implemented easily in software, (ii) does not require to upgrade
non-CoMP physicallayer hardware, (iii) allows for fully distributed
implementation for each user equipment (UE), and (iv) does not need extra
pilots or backhaul communications. We evaluate the throughput performance of
C&B on an uplink LTE system-level simulation platform, which is carefully
calibrated with Huawei. Our simulation results show that C&B achieves much
better throughput performance, compared to several widely-used power control
schemes.

transferring energy into pairs of inertial waves (or inertial-gravity waves
when buoyancy is important). In this paper, we perform inviscid
three-dimensional global hydrodynamic simulations to examine the growth and
consequence of this instability operating on the spiral waves driven by a
Jupiter-mass planet in a protoplanetary disk. We find that the spiral waves are
destabilized via the spiral wave instability (SWI), generating hydrodynamic
turbulence and sustained radially-alternating vertical flows that appear to be
associated with long wavelength inertial modes. In the interval $0.3~R_p \leq R
\leq 0.7~R_p$, where $R_p$ denotes the semi-major axis of the planetary orbit
(assumed to be 5~au), the estimated vertical diffusion rate associated with the
turbulence is characterized by $\alpha_{\rm diff} \sim (0.2-1.2) \times
10^{-2}$. For the disk model considered here, the diffusion rate is such that
particles with sizes up to several centimeters are vertically mixed within the
first pressure scale height. This suggests that the instability of spiral waves
launched by a giant planet can significantly disperse solid particles and trace
chemical species from the midplane. In planet formation models where the
continuous local production of chondrules/pebbles occurs over Myr time scales
to provide a feedstock for pebble accretion onto these bodies, this stirring of
solid particles may add a time constraint: planetary embryos and large
asteroids have to form before a gas giant forms in the outer disk, otherwise
the SWI will significantly decrease the chondrule/pebble accretion efficiency.

clustrocentric radii $R\sim300$kpc ($\mu_{\rm ICL}\sim27$mag arcsec$^{-2}$).
From these maps, we construct radial color and stellar mass profiles via SED
fitting and find clear negative color gradients in all systems with increasing
distance from the Brightest Cluster Galaxy (BCG). While this implies older/more
metal rich stellar components in the inner part of the ICL, we find the ICL
mostly consists of a $<2$Gyr population, and plausibly originated with $\log
M_*/M_\odot<10$ cluster galaxies. Further, we find 10-15% of the ICL's mass at
large radii ($>150$kpc) lies in a younger/bluer stellar population
($\sim1$Gyr), a phenomenon not seen in local samples. We attribute this light
to the higher fraction of starforming/(post-)starburst galaxies in clusters at
$z\sim0.5$. Ultimately, we find the ICL's total mass to be $\log M_{\rm *}^{\rm
ICL}/M_\odot\sim11$-12, constituting 5%-20% of the clusters' total stellar
mass, or about a half of the value at $z\sim0$. The above implies distinct
formation histories for the ICL and BCGs/other massive cluster galaxies; i.e.
the ICL at this epoch is still being constructed rapidly
($\sim40M_\odot$yr$^{-1}$), while the BCGs have mostly completed their
evolution. To be consistent with the ICL measurements of local massive
clusters, such as the Virgo, our data suggest mass acquisition mainly from
quiescent cluster galaxies is the principal source of ICL material in the
subsequent $\sim$5 Gyr of cosmic time.

their co-evolution. A powerful way to test the co-evolution scenario and learn
about the feedback processes linking galaxies and nuclear activity is to
measure these correlations as a function of redshift. Unfortunately, currently
MBH can only be estimated in active galaxies at cosmological distances. At
these distances, bright active galactic nuclei (AGN) can outshine the host
galaxy, making it extremely difficult to measure the host's luminosity.
Strongly lensed AGNs provide in principle a great opportunity to improve the
sensitivity and accuracy of the host galaxy luminosity measurements as the host
galaxy is magnified and more easily separated from the point source, provided
the lens model is sufficiently accurate. In order to measure the MBH-L
correlation with strong lensing, it is necessary to ensure that the lens
modelling is accurate, and that the host galaxy luminosity can be recovered to
at least a precision and accuracy better than that of the typical MBH
measurement. We carry out extensive and realistic simulations of deep Hubble
Space Telescope observations of lensed AGNs obtained by our collaboration. We
show that the host galaxy luminosity can be recovered with better accuracy and
precision than the typical uncertainty on MBH(~ 0.5 dex) for hosts as faint as
2-4 magnitudes dimmer than the AGN itself. Our simulations will be used to
estimate bias and uncertainties on the actual measurements to be presented in a

found no evidence of stellar velocity structure, even for Aquarius, which has
rotating HI gas. The velocity dispersions indicate that all three galaxies are
dark matter-dominated, with dark-to-baryonic mass ratios ranging from
$4.4^{+1.1}_{-0.8}$ (SagDIG) to $9.6^{+2.5}_{-1.8}$ (Aquarius). Leo A and
SagDIG have lower stellar metallicities than Aquarius, and they also have
higher gas fractions, both of which would be expected if Aquarius were farther
along in its chemical evolution. The metallicity distribution of Leo A is
inconsistent with a Closed or Leaky Box model of chemical evolution, suggesting
that the galaxy was pre-enriched or acquired external gas during star
formation. The metallicities of stars increased steadily for all three
galaxies, but possibly at different rates. The [$\alpha$/Fe] ratios at a given
[Fe/H] are lower than that of the Sculptor dwarf spheroidal galaxy, which
indicates more extended star formation histories than Sculptor, consistent with
photometrically derived star formation histories. Overall, the bulk kinematic

significantly from those of less delayed dwarf galaxies, including dwarf

solar-like oscillators, a substantial fraction of red giant stars observed by
Kepler exhibit abnormally low-amplitude dipole oscillation modes. Fuller et al.
(2015) suggests this effect is produced by strong core magnetic fields that
scatter dipole internal gravity waves (IGWs) into higher multipole IGWs or
magnetic waves. In this paper, we study the interaction of IGWs with a magnetic
field to test this mechanism. We consider two background stellar structures:
one with a uniform magnetic field, and another with a magnetic field that
varies both horizontally and vertically. We derive analytic solutions to the
wave propagation problem and validate them with numerical simulations. In both
cases, we find perfect conversion from IGWs into magnetic waves when the IGWs
propagate into a region exceeding a critical magnetic field strength. Downward
propagating IGWs cannot reflect into upward propagating IGWs because their
vertical wavenumber never approaches zero. Instead, they are converted into
upward propagating slow (Alfvenic) waves, and we show they will likely
dissipate as they propagate back into weakly magnetized regions. Therefore,
strong internal magnetic fields can produce dipole mode suppression in red
giants, and gravity modes will likely be totally absent from the pulsation
spectra of sufficiently magnetized stars.

The induced shocks effectively decouple the dynamics of the gas from that of
the stars, greatly enhancing the loss of gas angular momentum and leading to
increased central inflows. The ram-pressure shocks also cause, in many cases,
the entire galactic gas disc of the smaller galaxy to abruptly change its

a subsequent ""counter-flip"". This phenomenon results in the existence of
long-lived decoupled gas-stellar and stellar-stellar discs, which could hint at

frequently observed in active galactic nuclei (AGNs), we perform
two-dimensional radiation hydrodynamics simulations of the line-driven disk
winds, which are accelerated by the radiation force due to the spectral lines.
The line-driven winds are successfully launched for the range of $M_{\rm
BH}=10^{6-9}M_\odot$ and $\varepsilon$=0.1-0.5, and the resulting mass outflow
rate ($\dot{M_{\rm w}}$), momentum flux ($\dot{p_{\rm w}}$), and kinetic
luminosity ($\dot{E_{\rm w}}$) are in the region containing 90% of the
posterior probability distribution in the $\dot M_{\rm w}$-$L_{\rm bol}$ plane,
$\dot p_{\rm w}$-$L_{\rm bol}$ plane, and $\dot E_{\rm w}$-$L_{\rm bol}$ plane
shown in Gofford et al., where $M_{\rm BH}$ is the black hole mass,
$\varepsilon$ is the Eddington ratio, and $L_{\rm bol}$ is the bolometric
luminosity. The best-fitting relations in Gofford et al., $d\log\dot{M_{\rm
w}}/d\log{L_{\rm bol}}\sim 0.9$, $d\log\dot{p_{\rm w}}/d\log{L_{\rm bol}}\sim
1.2$, and $d\log\dot{E_{\rm w}}/d\log{L_{\rm bol}}\sim 1.5$, are roughly
consistent with our results, $d\log\dot{M_{\rm w}}/d\log{L_{\rm bol}}\sim 9/8$,
$d\log\dot{p_{\rm w}}/d\log{L_{\rm bol}}\sim 10/8$, and $d\log\dot{E_{\rm
w}}/d\log{L_{\rm bol}}\sim 11/8$. In addition, our model predicts that no UFO
features are detected for the AGNs with $\varepsilon \lesssim 0.01$, since the
winds do not appear. Also, only AGNs with $M_{\rm BH} \lesssim 10^8 M_\odot$
exhibit the UFOs when $\varepsilon \sim 0.025$. These predictions nicely agree
with the X-ray observations (Gofford et al.). These results support that the
line-driven disk wind is the origin of the UFOs.

In this article, we study the potential for SBN to discover these particles
through their subsequent decays in its detectors. We discuss the decays which
will be visible at SBN in a minimal and non-minimal extension of the Standard
Model, and perform simulations to compute the parameter space constraints which
could be placed in the absence of a signal. We demonstrate that the SBN program
can extend existing bounds on well constrained channels such as $N \rightarrow
\nu l^+ l^-$ and $N \rightarrow l^\pm \pi^\mp$ while, thanks to the strong
particle identification capabilities of liquid-Argon technology, also place
bounds on often neglected channels such as $N \rightarrow \nu\gamma$ and $N
\rightarrow \nu \pi^0$. Furthermore, we consider the phenomenological impact of
improved event timing information at the three detectors. As well as
considering its role in background reduction, we note that if the
light-detection systems in SBND and ICARUS can achieve nanosecond timing
resolution, the effect of finite sterile neutrino mass could be directly
observable, providing a smoking-gun signature for this class of models. We
stress throughout that the search for heavy nearly-sterile neutrinos is a
complementary new physics analysis to the search for eV-scale oscillations, and
would extend the BSM program of SBN while requiring no beam or detector
modifications.

of metals such as Mg and Ca, typically found in the atmospheres of ELM
proto-WDs. Here we investigate whether rotational mixing can maintain a
sufficient amount of He in the deeper driving region of the star, such that it
can fuel, through HeII-HeIII ionization, the observed pulsations in this type
of stars. Using state-of-the-art evolutionary models computed with MESA, we
show that rotational mixing can indeed explain qualitatively the very existence

Moreover, such objects are very likely to pulsate again during their final WD

place our source towards the faint end of the distribution of observed SMGs,

spectral energy distribution, which allows us not only to accurately estimate
its redshift but also to measure its stellar mass and other physical

undetected in optical and therefore are not typically accounted for when
measuring the cosmic star formation history (SFH). This faint galaxy population

$\mathcal{L}($Riemann$)$ theories according to their spectrum. Then, we

evolution and its implications on star formation theory make it a milestone for
the next decade. It is in the intermediate and high mass ranges where the
uncertainties of the IMF are larger. This is a major subject of debate and
analysis both for Galactic and extragalactic science. Aims: Our goal is to
constrain the IMF of the Galactic thin disc population using both Galactic
Classical Cepheids and Tycho-2 data. Methods: For the first time the
Besan\c{c}on Galaxy Model (BGM) has been used to characterise the Galactic
population of the Classical Cepheids. We have modified the age configuration in
the youngest populations of the BGM thin disc model to avoid artificial
discontinuities in the age distribution of the simulated Cepheids. Three
statistical methods, optimized for different mass ranges, have been developed
and applied to search for the best IMF that fits the observations. This
strategy allows us to quantify variations in the Star Formation History (SFH),
the stellar density at Sun position and the thin disc radial scale length. A
rigorous treatment of unresolved multiple stellar systems has been undertaken
adopting a spatial resolution according to the catalogues used. Results: For
intermediate masses, our study favours a composite field-star IMF slope of
$\alpha=3.2$ for the local thin disc, excluding flatter values such as the
Salpeter IMF ($\alpha=2.35$). Moreover, a constant Star Formation History is
definitively excluded, the three statistical methods considered here show that
it is inconsistent with the observational data. Conclusions: Using field stars
and Galactic Classical Cepheids, we have found, above $1M_\odot$, an IMF
steeper than the canonical stellar IMF of associations and young clusters. This
result is consistent with the predictions of the Integrated Galactic IMF.

analyze a scalar theory similar to the Dirac-Born-Infeld (DBI) theory with
vanishing gauge fields, with the DBI Lagrangian modulated by a scalar
potential. In the limit of a large number of scalars, we explicitly demonstrate
the existence of a composite massless spin-2 graviton in the spectrum that
couples to matter as in Einstein gravity. We comment on the cosmological
constant problem and the generalization to theories with fermions and gauge
fields.

merger histories, we quantify the contribution of physically distinct sources
of material to galaxy growth. We show that in situ star formation fueled by
fresh accretion dominates the early growth of galaxies of all masses, while the
re-accretion of gas previously ejected in galactic winds often dominates the
gas supply for a large portion of every galaxy's evolution. Externally
processed material contributes increasingly to the growth of central galaxies
at lower redshifts. This includes stars formed ex situ and gas delivered by
mergers, as well as smooth intergalactic transfer of gas from other galaxies,
an important but previously under-appreciated growth mode. By $z=0$, wind
transfer, i.e. the exchange of gas between galaxies via winds, can dominate gas
accretion onto $\sim L^{*}$ galaxies over fresh accretion and standard wind
recycling. Galaxies of all masses re-accrete >50% of the gas ejected in winds
and recurrent recycling is common. The total mass deposited in the
intergalactic medium per unit stellar mass formed increases in lower mass
galaxies. Re-accretion of wind ejecta occurs over a broad range of timescales,
with median recycling times ($\sim 100-350$ Myr) shorter than previously found.
Wind recycling typically occurs at the scale radius of the halo, independent of
halo mass and redshift, suggesting a characteristic recycling zone around
galaxies that scales with the size of the inner halo and the galaxy's stellar
component.

that can operate concurrently to form binary/multiple star systems: large scale
fragmentation of turbulent gas cores and filaments or smaller scale
fragmentation of a massive protostellar disk due to gravitational instability.
Observational evidence for turbulent fragmentation on scales of $>$1000~AU has
recently emerged. Previous evidence for disk fragmentation was limited to
inferences based on the separations of more-evolved pre-main sequence and
protostellar multiple systems. The triple protostar system L1448 IRS3B is an
ideal candidate to search for evidence of disk fragmentation. L1448 IRS3B is in
an early phase of the star formation process, likely less than 150,000 years in
age, and all protostars in the system are separated by $<$200~AU. Here we
report observations of dust and molecular gas emission that reveal a disk with
spiral structure surrounding the three protostars. Two protostars near the
center of the disk are separated by 61 AU, and a tertiary protostar is
coincident with a spiral arm in the outer disk at a 183 AU separation. The
inferred mass of the central pair of protostellar objects is $\sim$1 M$_{sun}$,
while the disk surrounding the three protostars has a total mass of $\sim$0.30
M$_{\sun}$. The tertiary protostar itself has a minimum mass of $\sim$0.085
M$_{sun}$. We demonstrate that the disk around L1448 IRS3B appears susceptible
to disk fragmentation at radii between 150~AU and 320~AU, overlapping with the
location of the tertiary protostar. This is consistent with models for a
protostellar disk that has recently undergone gravitational instability,
spawning one or two companion stars.

quantify the extent to which the stellar mass distribution of a deflector can
reproduce flux ratio and astrometric anomalies typically associated with the
presence of a dark matter subhalo. Using Hubble Space Telescope images of
nearby galaxies, we simulate strong lens systems with real distributions of
stellar mass as they would be observed at redshift $z_d=0.5$. We add a dark
matter halo and external shear to account for the smooth dark matter field,
omitting dark substructure, and use a Monte Carlo procedure to characterize the
distributions of image positions, time delays, and flux ratios for a compact
background source of diameter 5 pc. By convolving high-resolution images of
real galaxies with a Gaussian PSF, we simulate the most detailed smooth
potential one could construct given high quality data, and find scatter in flux
ratios of $\approx 10\%$, which we interpret as a typical deviation from a
smooth potential caused by large and small scale structure in the lensing
galaxy. We demonstrate that the flux ratio anomalies arising from galaxy-scale
baryonic structure can be minimized by selecting the most massive and round
deflectors, and by simultaneously modeling flux ratio and astrometric data.

isolated Milky Way-mass galaxy formation simulations and a novel prescription
for magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) supernova feedback. Our main result is that a
galactic dynamo can be seeded and driven by supernova explosions, resulting in
magnetic fields whose strength and morphology is consistent with observations.
In our model, supernovae supply thermal energy, and a low level magnetic field
along with their ejecta. The thermal expansion drives turbulence, which serves
a dual role by efficiently mixing the magnetic field into the interstellar
medium, and amplifying it by means of turbulent dynamo. The computational
prescription for MHD supernova feedback has been implemented within the
publicly available ENZO code, and is fully described in this paper. This
improves upon ENZO's existing modules for hydrodynamic feedback from stars and
active galaxies. We find that the field attains $\mu G$-levels over Gyr-time
scales throughout the disk. The field also develops large-scale structure,
which appears to be correlated with the disk's spiral arm density structure. We
find that seeding of the galactic dynamo by supernova ejecta predicts a
persistent correlation between gas metallicity and magnetic field strength. We
also generate all-sky maps of the Faraday rotation measure from the
simulation-predicted magnetic field, and present a direct comparison with

neutron star. If it harbours a strong magnetic field of magnetar strength, its
spin-down could explain several features of short gamma-ray burst afterglows.
The magnetorotational instability (MRI) has been proposed as a mechanism to
amplify the magnetic field to the required strength. Previous studies have,
however, neglected neutrinos, which may have an important impact on the MRI by
inducing a viscosity and drag. We investigate the impact of these neutrino
effects on the linear growth of the MRI by applying a local stability analysis
to snapshots of a neutron star merger simulation. We find that neutrinos have a
significant impact inside the hypermassive neutron star, but have at most a
marginal effect in the torus surrounding it. Inside the hypermassive neutron
star, the MRI grows in different regimes depending on the radius and on the
initial magnetic field strength. For magnetic fields weaker than
$10^{13}-10^{14}\,{\rm G}$, the growth rate of the MRI is significantly reduced
due to the presence of neutrinos. We conclude that neutrinos should be taken
into account when studying the growth of the MRI from realistic initial
magnetic fields. Current numerical simulations, which neglect neutrino
viscosity, are only consistent, i.e. in the adopted ideal regime, if they start
from artificially strong initial magnetic fields above $\sim10^{14}\,{\rm G}$.
One should be careful when extrapolating these results to lower initial
magnetic fields, where the MRI growth is strongly affected by neutrino
viscosity or drag.

to choose a noise model structure. The importance of this choice is that, for
the prediction error method (PEM) to provide asymptotically efficient
estimates, the model orders must be chosen according to the true system.
However, if only the plant estimates are of interest and the experiment is
performed in open loop, the noise model may be over-parameterized without
affecting the asymptotic properties of the plant. The limitation is that, as
PEM suffers in general from non-convexity, estimating an unnecessarily large
number of parameters will increase the chances of getting trapped in local
minima. To avoid this, a high order ARX model can first be estimated by least
squares, providing non-parametric estimates of the plant and noise model. Then,
model order reduction can be used to obtain a parametric model of the plant
only. We review existing methods to perform this, pointing out limitations and
connections between them. Then, we propose a method that connects favorable
properties from the previously reviewed approaches. We show that the proposed
method provides asymptotically efficient estimates of the plant with open loop
data. Finally, we perform a simulation study, which suggests that the proposed
method is competitive with PEM and other similar methods.

not necessarily the Higgs of the Standard Model. We distinguish two different
consistent expansions: EFTs that describe decoupling new-physics effects and
EFTs that describe non-decoupling new-physics effects. We briefly discuss the
first case, the SM-EFT. The focus of this thesis is on the non-decoupling EFTs.
We argue that the loop expansion is the consistent expansion in the second
case. We introduce the concept of chiral dimensions, equivalent to the loop
expansion. Using the chiral dimensions, we expand the electroweak chiral
Lagrangian up to next-to-leading order,
$\mathcal{O}(f^{2}/\Lambda^{2})=\mathcal{O}(1/16\pi^{2})$.
  We then compare the decoupling and the non-decoupling EFT. We also consider
scenarios in which the new-physics sector is non-decoupling at a scale $f$, far
above the electroweak-scale $v$. We discuss the relevance of the resulting
double expansion in $\xi=v^{2}/f^{2}$ and $f^{2}/\Lambda^{2}$ for the data
analysis at the LHC.
  In the second part, we discuss the applications of the EFTs, especially of
the electroweak chiral Lagrangian. First, we connect the EFT with explicit
models of new physics. We show how different regions of the parameter space of
the same model generate a decoupling and a non-decoupling EFT.
  Second, we use the expansion at leading order to describe the current LHC
Higgs data. We show how the current parametrization of the Higgs data, the
$\kappa$-framework, can be justified quantum field theoretically by the EFT. We
fit the data of Run-1 (2010--2013). The effective Lagrangian describing this
data can be reduced to six free parameters. The result of this fit is
consistent with the SM, but it has statistical uncertainties of about ten
percent.

interplanetary coronal mass ejections (ICMEs) and (solar energetic particles)
SEPs made contact with Mars. The interactions were observed by several
spacecraft, including Mars Express (MEX), Mars Atmosphere and Volatile
Evolution Mission (MAVEN), and Mars Odyssey (MO). The ICME disturbances were
characterized by an increase in ion speed, plasma temperature, magnetic field
magnitude, and energetic electron flux. Furthermore, increased solar wind
density and speeds, unusually high local electron densities and high flow
velocities were detected on the nightside at high altitudes during the March
8th event. These effects are thought to be due to the transport of ionospheric
plasma away from Mars. The peak electron density at periapsis shows a
substantial increase, reaching number densities about 2.7 x 104 cm-3 during the
second ICME in the deep nightside, which corresponds to an increase in the
MOHigh-Energy Neutron Detector flux, suggesting an increase in the ionization
of the neutral atmosphere due to the high intensity of charged particles. SEPs
show a substantial enhancement before the shock of fourth ICME causing impact
ionization and absorption of the surface echo intensity which drops to the
noise levels. Moreover, the peak ionospheric density exhibits a discrete
enhancement over a period of about 30 hrs around the same location, which maybe
due to impact ionization. Ion escape rates at this time are calculated to be in
the order of 1025 - 1026 s-1, consistent with MAVEN results, but somewhat
higher.

found in high resolution Extreme Ultraviolet (EUV) images from the Solar
Dynamics Observatory (SDO)/Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA) and having good
coverage in magnetograms from the SDO/Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (HMI).
Recent studies show that coronal jets are driven by the eruption of a
small-scale filament (called a minifilament). However the trigger of these
eruptions is still unknown. In the present study we address the question: what
leads to the jet-driving minifilament eruptions? The EUV observations show that
there is a cool-transition-region-plasma minifilament present prior to each jet
event and the minifilament eruption drives the jet. By examining pre-jet
evolutionary changes in the line-of-sight photospheric magnetic field we
observe that each pre-jet minifilament resides over the neutral line between
majority-polarity and minority-polarity patches of magnetic flux. In each of
the ten cases, the opposite-polarity patches approach and merge with each other
(flux reduction between 21 and 57%). After several hours, continuous flux
cancellation at the neutral line apparently destabilizes the field holding the
cool-plasma minifilament to erupt and undergo internal reconnection, and
external reconnection with the surrounding-coronal field. The external
reconnection opens the minifilament field allowing the minifilament material to
escape outwards, forming part of the jet spire. Thus we found that each of the
ten jets resulted from eruption of a minifilament following flux cancellation
at the neutral line under the minifilament. These observations establish that
magnetic flux cancellation is usually the trigger of quiet region coronal jet
eruptions.

not cause a split of the convection zone as it was seen in simulations of
He-shell flashes in post-AGB and low-Z AGB stars. We estimate that for the
production of first-peak heavy elements this site can be of similar importance
for galactic chemical evolution as the s-process production by low-mass AGB
stars. The He-shell flashes result in the expansion and, ultimately, ejection
of the accreted and then i-process enriched material, via super-Eddington
luminosity winds or Roche-lobe overflow. The white dwarf models do not retain
any significant amount of the accreted mass, with a He retention efficiency of

lower viscosity as compared to linear and wormlike micelles, presumably due to
stress relaxation arising from the sliding motion of branches along the main

motion and stress relaxation in micellar fluids. Further, depending upon the
surfactant and salt concentrations, which in turn determine the microstructure,
we observe normal, subdiffusive and superdiffusive motion of surfactants.

the orientation changes can be large, causing large changes in the binary's
orbital eccentricity as well. We present a general treatment of this problem
based on the Fokker-Planck equation for f, defined as the probability
distribution for the binary's orbital elements. First- and second-order
diffusion coefficients are derived for the orbital elements of the binary using
numerical scattering experiments, and analytic approximations are presented for
some of these coefficients. Solutions of the Fokker-Planck equation are then
derived under various assumptions about the initial rotational state of the

orbital elements can become qualitatively different when we introduce nuclear
rotation: 1) the orientation of the binary's orbit evolves toward alignment
with the plane of rotation of the nucleus; 2) binary orbital eccentricity
decreases for aligned binaries and increases for counter-aligned ones. We find
that the diffusive (random-walk) component of a binary's evolution is small in
nuclei with non-negligible rotation, and we derive the time-evolution equations
for the semimajor axis, eccentricity and inclination in that approximation. The
aforementioned effects could influence gravitational wave production as well as
the relative orientation of host galaxies and radio jets.

knowledge-based means. A more expensive approach that we developed relies on a
nearest neighbor framework and achieves an accuracy of 94.34%. Employing dense
vector representations learned from unlabeled free text has been shown to
benefit many language processing tasks recently and our efforts show that
biomedical WSD is no exception to this trend. For a complex and rapidly
evolving domain such as biomedicine, building labeled datasets for larger sets
of ambiguous terms may be impractical. Here, we show that weak supervision that
leverages recent advances in representation learning can rival supervised
approaches in biomedical WSD. However, external knowledge bases (here sense
inventories) play a key role in the improvements achieved.

institution, called a ranker, evaluates a set of individuals based on

that represents the relative quality of the individuals. While automatic and
therefore seemingly objective, rankers can, and often do, discriminate against
individuals and systematically disadvantage members of protected groups. This
warrants a careful study of the fairness of a ranking scheme.
  In this paper we propose fairness measures for ranked outputs. We develop a
data generation procedure that allows us to systematically control the degree
of unfairness in the output, and study the behavior of our measures on these
datasets. We then apply our proposed measures to several real datasets, and
demonstrate cases of unfairness. Finally, we show preliminary results of
incorporating our ranked fairness measures into an optimization framework, and
show potential for improving fairness of ranked outputs while maintaining

stars, with the lowest CN, was found to be generally chemically distinct in
elemental abundances from the second generation populations. As expected,
[N/Fe] increases with increasing CN strength, but the only other element that
correlated with CN was barium. The two largest populations of stars were found
to have the same rate of carbon astration as the stars ascend the giant branch.
We were also able to confirm that four previously identified extratidal stars

in cooler stars with Kepler, but was previously undetected for solar-type stars
due to sample contamination by subgiants. A tenuous connection between the

bimodality is due to the age distribution of stars within ~300pc of the Sun,

improve differential diagnosis and prognosis prediction in Schizophrenia. In
chronic psychotic patients, the representation of verbal reports as word graphs
provides automated sorting of schizophrenia, bipolar disorder and control
groups based on the degree of speech connectedness. Here we aim to use machine
learning to verify whether speech connectedness during first clinical contact
can predict negative symptoms and Schizophrenia diagnosis six months later.
Methods: PANSS scores and memory reports were collected from 21 patients
undergoing first clinical contact for recent-onset psychosis and followed for 6
months to establish DSM-IV diagnosis, and 21 healthy controls. Each report was
represented as a graph in which words corresponded to nodes, and node temporal
succession corresponded to edges. Three connectedness attributes were extracted
from each graph, z-scores to random graph distributions were measured,
correlated with the PANSS negative subscale, combined into a single
Fragmentation Index, and used for predictions. Findings: Random-like speech was
prevalent among Schizophrenia patients (64% x 5% in Control group, p=0.0002).
Connectedness explained 92% of the PANSS negative subscale variance (p=0.0001).
The Fragmentation Index classified low versus high scores of PANSS negative
subscale with 93% accuracy (AUC=1), predicted Schizophrenia diagnosis with 89%
accuracy (AUC=0.89), and was validated in an independent cohort of chronic
psychotic patients. Interpretation: The structural randomness of speech graph
connectedness is increased in Schizophrenia. It provides a quantitative
measurement of word salad as a Fragmentation Index that tightly correlates with
negative symptoms and predicts Schizophrenia diagnosis during first clinical
contact of recent-onset psychosis.

scattering by periodic arrays of cylinders of arbitrary cross section-with
application to wire gratings, particle arrays and reflectarrays and, indeed,
general arrays of conducting or dielectric bounded obstacles under both TE and
TM polarized illumination. The proposed method, which, for definiteness is
demonstrated here for arrays of perfectly conducting particles under TE
polarization, is based on use of the shifted Green-function method introduced
in the recent contribution (Bruno and Delourme, Jour. Computat. Phys. pp.
262--290 (2014)). A certain infinite term arises at Wood anomalies for the
cylinder-array problems considered here that is not present in the previous
rough-surface case. As shown in this paper, these infinite terms can be treated
via an application of ideas related to the Woodbury-Sherman-Morrison formulae.
The resulting approach, which is applicable to general arrays of obstacles even
at and around Wood-anomaly frequencies, exhibits fast convergence and high
accuracies. For example, a few hundreds of milliseconds suffice for the
proposed approach to evaluate solutions throughout the resonance region
(wavelengths comparable to the period and cylinder sizes) with full
single-precision accuracy.

a subset of data is being used at each iteration to accelerate the

mathematical optimization fields. The most popular member of this family of
algorithms in the X-ray CT field is ordered-subsets. Even though it performs
well in earlier iterations, the lack of convergence in later iterations is a
known phenomenon. In this paper, we propose two incremental methods that use

surface and the dynamical cancellations of its critical points. The data of a
spectral sequence computed for $(\mathcal{N}_{\ast}(f),\Delta)$ is encoded in a
family of matrices $\Delta^r$ produced by the Spectral Sequence Sweeping
Algorithm (SSSA), which has as its initial input the differential $\Delta$. As
one turns the pages of the spectral sequence, differentials which are
isomorphisms produce cancellation of pairs of modules. Corresponding to these
cancellations, a family of circle-valued Morse functions $f^r$ is obtained by
successively removing the corresponding pairs of critical points of $f$. We
also keep track of all dynamical information on the birth and death of
connecting orbits between consecutive critical points, as well as periodic
orbits that arise within a family of negative gradient flows associated to
$f^r$.

  Effects","Forthcoming, Statistical Science",,,,"stat.ME","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  This study introduces a new approach to power analysis in the context of
estimating a local average treatment effect (LATE), where the study subjects
exhibit noncompliance with treatment assignment. As a result of distributional
complications in the LATE context, compared to the simple ATE context, there is
currently no standard method of power analysis for the LATE. Moreover, existing
methods and commonly used substitutes - which include instrumental variable
(IV), intent-to-treat (ITT), and scaled ATE power analyses - require specifying
generally unknown variance terms and/or rely upon strong and unrealistic
assumptions, thus providing unreliable guidance on the power of tests of the
LATE. This study develops a new approach that uses standardized effect sizes to
place bounds on the power for the most commonly used estimator of the LATE, the
Wald IV estimator, whereby variance terms and distributional parameters need
not be specified nor assumed. Instead, in addition to the effect size, sample
size, and error tolerance parameters, the only other parameter that must be
specified by the researcher is the compliance rate. Additional conditions can
also be introduced to further narrow the bounds on the power calculation. The
result is a generalized approach to power analysis in the LATE context that is
simple to implement.

identified 48 dense cores. Twenty out of the 48 cores are protostellar due to
their association with young stellar objects (YSOs) and/or X-ray point-sources,
while the other 28 cores are likely prestellar and unrelated with known IR or
X-ray emission. Using APEX 870 $\mu$m continuum emission, we also identified
the 18 clumps hosting these cores. Through virial analysis using the ALMA
N$_2$H$^+$ and VLA/Effelsberg NH$_3$ molecular line data, we found a decreasing
trend in the virial parameter with decreasing scales from filaments to clumps,
and then to cores. The virial parameters of $0.1-1.3$ in cores, indicate that
cores are likely undergoing dynamical collapse. The cumulative Core Mass
Function (CMF) for the prestellar cores candidates has a power law index of
$\alpha=1.6$, with masses ranging from 1.5 to 22 $M_\odot$. We find no massive
prestellar or protostellar cores. Previous studies suggest that massive O-tpye
stars have not been produced yet in this region. Therefore, high-mass stars
should be formed in the prestellar cores by accreting a significant amount of
gas from the surrounding medium. Another possibility is that low-mass YSOs
become massive by accreting from their parent cores that are fed by filaments.
These two possibilities might be consistent with the scenario of global
hierarchical collapse.

transformation (i.e., neutrino-antineutrino transformation), coupled to

Significant neutrino spin transformation in, for example, the neutronization
burst, could alter the fluences of neutrinos and antineutrinos in a way which
is potentially detectable for a Galactic core collapse supernova. Our
calculations for the first time incorporate geometric dilution in the spin
evolution of the neutrinos and combine two-flavor and three-flavor evolution
with spin mixing physics. We find that significant spin transformations can
occur, but only with a large neutrino luminosity and an electron fraction
($Y_e$) profile which facilitates adiabatic conditions for the spin-channel
resonance. Using our adopted parameters of neutrino energy spectra, luminosity,
density and $Y_e$ profiles, our calculations require an unrealistically large
neutrino rest mass to sustain the spin transformation. It is an open question
whether examining different density profiles or incorporating other sources of
nonlinear feedback, such as $Y_e$ feedback, could mitigate this need. We find
that spin transformations are not sensitive to the flavor structure of
neutrinos, i.e., the spin transformations occur regardless of whether we
simulate two- or three-flavor transformations. In the two-flavor case, spin
transformations were insensitive to the choice of solar or atmospheric
mass-squared splitting as well as the choice of the Majorana phase.
Importantly, our three-flavor simulations, as well as our two-flavor
simulations done with the atmospheric mass-squared splitting, show that the
inclusion of spin degrees of freedom can significantly and qualitatively alter
neutrino flavor evolution.

new borophane conformers with much lower total-energy. The most stable one,
washboard-like borophane (W-borophane), has energy about 113.41 meV/atom lower
than C-borophane. In order to explain the relative stability of different
borophane conformers, the atom configuration, density of states, charge

H atoms is crucial for the stability of borophane. In different borophane
conformers, the bonding characteristics between B and H atoms are similar, but
the B-B bonds in W-borophane are much stronger than that in C-borophane or
other structures. In addition, we examined the dynamical stability of borophane
conformers by phonon dispersions and found that the four new conformers are all
dynamically stable. Finally the mechanical properties of borophane conformers
along an arbitrary direction have been discussed. W-borophane possesses unique
electronic structure (Dirac cone), good stability and superior mechanical
properties. W-borophane has broad perspective for nano electronic device.

with the corresponding forward DVF in 4D reconstruction and dose calculation,
adaptive radiation therapy, and simultaneous deformable registration. This
study aims at improving both accuracy and efficiency of iterative algorithms
for DVF inversion, and advancing our understanding of divergence and latency
conditions. Method: We introduce a framework of fixed-point iteration
algorithms with active feedback control for DVF inversion. Based on rigorous
convergence analysis, we design control mechanisms for modulating the inverse
consistency (IC) residual of the current iterate, to be used as feedback into
the next iterate. The control is designed adaptively to the input DVF with the
objective to enlarge the convergence area and expedite convergence. Three
particular settings of feedback control are introduced: constant value over the
domain throughout the iteration; alternating values between iteration steps;
and spatially variant values. We also introduce three spectral measures of the
displacement Jacobian for characterizing a DVF. These measures reveal the
critical role of what we term the non-translational displacement component
(NTDC) of the DVF. We carry out inversion experiments with an analytical DVF
pair, and with DVFs associated with thoracic CT images of 6 patients at end of
expiration and end of inspiration. Results: NTDC-adaptive iterations are shown
to attain a larger convergence region at a faster pace compared to previous
non-adaptive DVF inversion iteration algorithms. By our numerical experiments,
alternating control yields smaller IC residuals and inversion errors than
constant control. Spatially variant control renders smaller residuals and
errors by at least an order of magnitude, compared to other schemes, in no more
than 10 steps. Inversion results also show remarkable quantitative agreement
with analysis-based predictions. Conclusion: Our analysis captures properties
of DVF data associated with clinical CT images, and provides new understanding
of iterative DVF inversion algorithms with a simple residual feedback control.
Adaptive control is necessary and highly effective in the presence of non-small
NTDCs. The adaptive iterations or the spectral measures, or both, may
potentially be incorporated into deformable image registration methods.

magnetic orders co-exist on the nano-scale and compete for the same electronic
states. The static magnetic moment disappears rather sharply near optimal
doping, however, in the slightly overdoped region there is still an enhancement

the gap magnitude reported from specific heat measurements, the superconducting

It was determined that the mass of the gas not traced by the 21-cm or 2.6-mm
surveys is ~25% of the mass of HI in the optically thin case and is larger than
the mass of the molecular gas traced by carbon monoxide by a factor of up to 5.
The measured gamma-ray emissivity spectrum is consistent with a model based on
CR spectra measured at the Earth and the nuclear enhancement factor of <=1.5.
It is, however, lower than local HI emissivities reported by previous Fermi-LAT
studies employing different analysis methods and assumptions on ISM properties
by 15%-20% in energies below a few GeV, even if we take account of the
statistical and systematic uncertainties. The origin of the discrepancy is also
discussed.

including the distinct asymmetric double-peak structure arising from the
opening of a hybridization gap when a coherent heavy Fermi liquid is formed.
Both the hybridization gap, found to be 7.2 $\pm$ 0.3 meV at 4 K, and the
conductance enhancement above a flat background decrease upon increasing
temperature. While the hybridization gap is extrapolated to remain finite up to
$\sim$28 K, close to the temperature around which the magnetic susceptibility
displays a broad peak, the conductance enhancement vanishes at $\sim$18 K,
slightly above the antiferromagnetic transition temperature ($T_\textrm{N}$
$\approx$ 14 K). This rapid decrease of the conductance enhancement is
understood as a consequence of the junction drifting away from the ballistic
regime due to increased scattering off magnons associated with the localized U
5$f$ electrons. This shows that while the hybridization gap opening is not
directly associated with the antiferromagnetic ordering, its visibility in the
conductance is greatly affected by the temperature-dependent magnetic
excitations. Our findings are not only consistent with the 5$f$ dual-nature

features, they also usually share common patterns. This observation has been
exploited partially in a recently proposed dictionary learning framework by
separating the particularity and the commonality (COPAR). Inspired by this, we
propose a novel method to explicitly and simultaneously learn a set of common
patterns as well as class-specific features for classification with more
intuitive constraints. Our dictionary learning framework is hence characterized
by both a shared dictionary and particular (class-specific) dictionaries. For
the shared dictionary, we enforce a low-rank constraint, i.e. claim that its
spanning subspace should have low dimension and the coefficients corresponding
to this dictionary should be similar. For the particular dictionaries, we
impose on them the well-known constraints stated in the Fisher discrimination
dictionary learning (FDDL). Further, we develop new fast and accurate
algorithms to solve the subproblems in the learning step, accelerating its
convergence. The said algorithms could also be applied to FDDL and its
extensions. The efficiencies of these algorithms are theoretically and
experimentally verified by comparing their complexities and running time with
those of other well-known dictionary learning methods. Experimental results on
widely used image datasets establish the advantages of our method over
state-of-the-art dictionary learning methods.

techniques have limited usefulness. One of the reasons is that programmers
typically have to understand why the program fails before fixing it. In this
work, we aim to help programmers understand a bug by automatically generating
likely invariants which are violated in the failed tests. Given a program with
an initial assertion and at least one test case failing the assertion, we first
generate random test cases, identify potential bug locations through bug
localization, and then generate program state mutation based on active learning
techniques to identify a predicate ""explaining"" the cause of the bug. The
predicate is a classifier for the passed test cases and failed test cases. Our
main contribution is the application of invariant learning for bug explanation,
as well as a novel approach to overcome the problem of lack of test cases in
practice. We apply our method to real-world bugs and show the generated

obtain the non-local (history) stiffness matrices, in which the non-locality is
presented analytically for uniform grids. We also investigate two distinct

better-conditioned system and accuracy. We consider smooth and singular
solutions, where the singularity can occur at boundary points as well as in the
interior domain. We also construct two non-uniform grids over the whole

of its input or memory have been used successfully in deep learning models in
recent years. Attention has improved image classification, image captioning,
speech recognition, generative models, and learning algorithmic tasks, but it
had probably the largest impact on neural machine translation.
  Recently, similar improvements have been obtained using alternative
mechanisms that do not focus on a single part of a memory but operate on all of
it in parallel, in a uniform way. Such mechanism, which we call active memory,
improved over attention in algorithmic tasks, image processing, and in
generative modelling.
  So far, however, active memory has not improved over attention for most
natural language processing tasks, in particular for machine translation. We
analyze this shortcoming in this paper and propose an extended model of active
memory that matches existing attention models on neural machine translation and
generalizes better to longer sentences. We investigate this model and explain
why previous active memory models did not succeed. Finally, we discuss when
active memory brings most benefits and where attention can be a better choice.

variables including target active/dormant meta-state, target kinematic state,
and multipath data association. Based on variational Bayesian inference, we
propose a novel joint detection and tracking algorithm that incorporates
multipath data association, target detection and target state estimation in a
unified Bayesian framework. The posterior probabilities of these latent
variables are derived in a closed-form iterative manner, which is effective for
reducing the performance deterioration caused by the coupling between
estimation errors and identification errors. Loopy belief propagation is
exploited to approximately calculate the probability of multipath data
association, saving the computational cost significantly. Simulation results of
over-the-horizon radar multitarget tracking show that the proposed algorithm
outperforms multihypothesis multipath track fusion and multi-detection
(hypothesis-oriented) multiple hypothesis tracker, especially under low
signal-to-noise ratio circumstance.

has discouraged developing nations from participating in space activities,
while developed nations have steadily cut down their space-science budget in

in building ambitious space-science programs, particularly in the context of
developing nations. I devise a framework to quantify the impact of
international collaborations in achieving the space-science goals as well as in
enhancing the key sectors of development of a nation. I apply this framework on
two case studies, (i) Indian Space Research Organization - a case of
space-science program from a developing nation that has historically engaged in
international collaborations, and (ii) International Space Station - a case for
a long term collaboration between matured space-science programs. My study
concludes that international cooperation in space can significantly enhance
scope of science goals, but has relatively little return of investment towards

covariance-based feature representation. A variety of methods have been
proposed to boost its efficacy, with some recent ones resorting to nonlinear
kernel technique. Noting that the essence of this feature representation is to
characterise the underlying structure of visual features, this paper argues
that an equally, if not more, important approach to boosting its efficacy shall
be to improve the quality of this characterisation. Following this idea, we
propose to exploit the structure sparsity of visual features in skeletal human
action recognition, and compute sparse inverse covariance estimate (SICE) as
feature representation. We discuss the advantage of this new representation on
dealing with small sample, high dimensionality, and modelling capability.
Furthermore, utilising the monotonicity property of SICE, we efficiently
generate a hierarchy of SICE matrices to characterise the structure of visual
features at different sparsity levels, and two discriminative learning
algorithms are then developed to adaptively integrate them to perform
recognition. As demonstrated by extensive experiments, the proposed
representation leads to significantly improved recognition performance over the
state-of-the-art comparable methods. In particular, as a method fully based on
linear technique, it is comparable or even better than those employing
nonlinear kernel technique. This result well demonstrates the value of
exploiting structure sparsity for covariance-based feature representation.

in the perpendicular direction. To design modern nanoscale electromechanical
devices with special functions, two dimensional (2D) auxetic materials are
highly desirable. In this work, based on first principles calculations, we

Poisson's ratio of {\delta}-P are all anisotropic. The NPR value along the
grooved direction is up to -0.267, which is much higher than the recently
reported 2D auxetic materials. The auxetic effect of {\delta}-P originated from
its puckered structure is robust and insensitive to the number of layers due to
weak interlayer interactions. Moreover, {\delta}-P possesses good flexibility
because of its relatively small Young's modulus and high critical crack strain.

  Descent","73 pages",,,,"stat.ML","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The stochastic gradient descent (SGD) algorithm has been widely used in
statistical estimation for large-scale data due to its computational and memory
efficiency. While most existing works focus on the convergence of the objective
function or the error of the obtained solution, we investigate the problem of
statistical inference of true model parameters based on SGD when the population
loss function is strongly convex and satisfies certain smoothness conditions.
Our main contributions are two-fold. First, in the fixed dimension setup, we
propose two consistent estimators of the asymptotic covariance of the average
iterate from SGD: (1) a plug-in estimator, and (2) a batch-means estimator,
which is computationally more efficient and only uses the iterates from SGD.
Both proposed estimators allow us to construct asymptotically exact confidence
intervals and hypothesis tests. Second, for high-dimensional linear regression,
using a variant of the SGD algorithm, we construct a debiased estimator of each
regression coefficient that is asymptotically normal. This gives a one-pass
algorithm for computing both the sparse regression coefficients and confidence
intervals, which is computationally attractive and applicable to online data.

both active galactic nuclei and X-ray binaries. Their radiative properties
follow some general scaling laws which primarily depend on their masses and
accretion rates. However, it has been suggested that the black hole spin can
also strongly influence the power and radio flux of these. Here, we attempt to
estimate the dependency of the radio luminosity of steady jets launched by
accretion disks on black hole mass, accretion rate and spin using numerical
simulations. We make use of 3D GRMHD simulations of accretion disks around
low-luminosity black holes in which the jet radio emission is produced by the
jet sheath. We find that the radio flux increases roughly by a factor of 6 as
the back hole spin increases from a~0 to a=0.98. This is comparable to the
increase in accretion power with spin, meaning that the ratio between radio jet
and accretion power is hardly changing. Although our jet spine power scales as
expected for the Blandford-Znajek process, the dependency of jet radio
luminosity on the black hole spin is somewhat weaker. Also weakly rotating
black holes can produce visible radio jets. The overall scaling of the radio
emission with black hole mass and accretion rate is consistent with the
scale-invariant analytical models used to explain the fundamental plane of
black hole activity. Spin does not introduce a significant scatter in this
model. The jet-sheath model can describe well resolved accreting systems, such
as SgrA* and M87, as well as the general scaling behavior of low-luminosity
black holes. Hence the model should be applicable to a wide range of radio jets
in sub-Eddington black holes. The black hole spin has an effect on the
production of visible radio jet, but it may not be the main driver to produce
visible radio jets. An extension of our findings to powerful quasars remains
speculative.

investigated ballistic effects from an ion mixing formalism point of view. The
displacement cascades in copper and AgCu alloy were obtained using binary
collision approximation (BCA) and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. We
employed BCA-based code MARLOWE for its ability to simulate high energy
displacement cascades. A first set of simulations was performed using both
methods on pure copper for energies ranging from 0.5 keV to 20 keV. The results
of BCA and MD simulations are compared, evidencing rationally parametrized
MARLOWE to be predictive. A second set of simulations was then carried out
using BCA only. Following experimental studies, AgCu alloy was subjected to 1
MeV krypton ions. MARLOW simulations are found to be in good agreement with
experimental results.

Spintronics, including opportunities for new nanoscale radiofrequency devices.
Among the new functionalities is the radiofrequency(rf) detection using the
spin diode rectification effect in spin torque nano-oscillators (STNOs). In
this study, we focus on a new phenomenon, the resonant expulsion of a magnetic
vortex in STNOs. This effect is observed when the excitation vortex radius, due
to spin torques associated to rf currents, becomes larger than the actual
radius of the STNO. This vortex expulsion is leading to a sharp variation of
the voltage at the resonant frequency. Here we show that the detected frequency
can be tuned by different parameters; furthermore, a simultaneous detection of
different rf signals can be achieved by real time measurements with several
STNOs having different diameters. This result constitutes a first
proof-of-principle towards the development of a new kind of nanoscale rf
threshold detector.

the critical regions, but occurs for all fields greater than zero at

experimental results. In addition, the heat capacity in our material is
suggestive of an extraordinary contribution from zero-point fluctuations and

two field-induced critical points. The data are consistent with a
two-dimensional nature of spin excitations in the system.

study the transition to multi-language states in the stochastic block model and

the number and relative size of communities and the structure of
intra-/inter-community links. Our results provide a theoretical justification

eigenstates and drastically alters transport properties of the lattice. In the
original Anderson model, the addition of a periodic driving increases, in a
certain range of the driving's frequency and amplitude, localization length of
the appearing Floquet eigenstates. We go beyond the uncorrelated disorder case
and address the experimentally relevant situation when spatial correlations are
present in the lattice potential. Their presence induces the creation of an
effective mobility edge in the energy spectrum of the system. We find that a
slow driving leads to resonant hybridization of the Floquet states, by
increasing both the participation numbers and effective widths of the states in
the strongly localized band and decreasing values of these characteristics for
the states in the quasi-extended band. Strong driving homogenizes the bands, so
that the Floquet states loose compactness and tend to be spatially smeared. In
the basis of the stationary Hamiltonian, these states retain localization in
terms of participation number but become de-localized and spectrum-wide in term
of their effective widths. Signatures of thermalization are also observed.

neutrons (isospin-violating dark matter), the interpretation of the
experimental limits on the dark matter spin-independent cross section may be
significantly modified. On the one hand, the direct detection constraints are
shifted depending on the target nucleus, possibly changing the hierarchy among
different experiments. On the other hand, the relative strength between the
bounds from neutrino detectors and those from direct detection experiments is
altered, allowing the former to be more competitive. In this paper, the status
of isospin-violating dark matter is assessed in the light of recent data, and
the prospects for its detection in the near future are analyzed. We find, for
example, that there are regions in the parameter space where IceCube currently
provides the most stringent limits on the spin-independent cross section, or
others where the expected sensitivity of DEAP-3600 is well above the LUX
exclusion limit. Our results highlight the complementarity among different
targets in direct detection experiments, and between direct detection and
neutrino searches in the quest for a dark matter signal.

years, the languages and models that we use to program these machines have
remained much more static. This is not from a lack of effort, but instead by
virtue of the fact that the foundation that many programming languages are
built on is not sufficient for the level of expressivity required for parallel
work. The result is an implicit trade-off between programmability and
performance which is made worse due to the fact that, whilst many scientific
users are experts within their own fields, they are not HPC experts.
  Type oriented programming looks to address this by encoding the complexity of
a language via the type system. Most of the language functionality is contained
within a loosely coupled type library that can be flexibly used to control many
aspects such as parallelism. Due to the high level nature of this approach
there is much information available during compilation which can be used for
optimisation and, in the absence of type information, the compiler can apply
sensible default options thus supporting both the expert programmer and novice
alike.
  We demonstrate that, at no performance or scalability penalty when running on
up to 8196 cores of a Cray XE6 system, codes written in this type oriented
manner provide improved programmability. The programmer is able to write
simple, implicit parallel, HPC code at a high level and then explicitly tune by
adding additional type information if required.

resource in a line, a beam-splitter coupling two transmission lines, and a
single photon detector located at the end of the other line. When a single

high fidelity in the opposite line. For example, we show that the high fidelity

to obtain model-independent distortion constraints on primordial

plasmas are cold, following the first collision the plasma shells are
substantially heated, implying that in a scenario of multiple collisions, most
collisions take place between plasmas of non-zero temperatures. Here, we
calculate the dynamical properties of plasmas resulting from collision between
arbitrarily hot plasma shells, moving at arbitrary speeds. We provide simple
analytical expressions valid for both the ultra-relativistic and Newtonian
velocities, for both hot and cold plasmas. We derive the minimum criteria
required for the formation of the two-shock wave system, and show that in the
relativistic limit, the minimum Lorentz factor is proportional to the square
root of the ratio of the initial plasmas enthalpies. We provide basic scaling
laws of synchrotron emission from both the forward and reverse shock waves, and
show how these can be used to deduce the properties of the colliding shells.
Finally, we discuss the implications of these results in the study of several
astronomical transients, such as x-ray binaries, radio load quasars and
gamma-ray bursts.

tetrahedra gives rise to highly correlated magnetic phases with strong
fluctuations, including spin liquids and spin ices. It is an open question how

Quenched random crystal fields and disordered exchange interactions can
therefore be introduced into otherwise perfect pyrochlore lattices of magnetic

magnetic order at low temperatures, and instead induces a strongly-fluctuating
Coulomb spin liquid with defect-induced frozen magnetic degrees of freedom.

interconnect virtual machines in a more flexible manner. However, this paper
demonstrates that virtual switches introduce new attack surfaces in cloud
setups, whose effects can be disastrous. Our analysis shows that these
vulnerabilities are caused by: (1) inappropriate security assumptions
(privileged virtual switch execution in kernel and user space), (2) the logical
centralization of such networks (e.g., OpenStack or SDN), (3) the presence of
bi-directional communication channels between data plane systems and the
centralized controller, and (4) non-standard protocol parsers.
  Our work highlights the need to accommodate the data plane(s) in our threat
models. In particular, it forces us to revisit today's assumption that the data
plane can only be compromised by a sophisticated attacker: we show that
compromising the data plane of modern computer networks can actually be
performed by a very simple attacker with limited resources only and at low cost
(i.e., at the cost of renting a virtual machine in the Cloud). As a case study,
we fuzzed only 2\% of the code-base of a production quality virtual switch's
packet processor (namely OvS), identifying serious vulnerabilities leading to
unauthenticated remote code execution. In particular, we present the ""rein
worm"" which allows us to fully compromise test-setups in less than 100 seconds.
We also evaluate the performance overhead of existing mitigations such as ASLR,
PIEs, and unconditional stack canaries on OvS. We find that while applying
these countermeasures in kernel-space incurs a significant overhead, in
user-space the performance overhead is negligible.

a Von-K\'arm\'an swirling flow driven by two propellers in a closed cylinder.
The first parameter is the inertia mo- mentum of the propellers, and the second
parameter is the aspect ratio, i.e. the distance between the propellers $H$
divided by the diameter $D$. We use a cell with a fixed diameter $D$ but where
the distance between the propellers can be turned continuously and where the
inertia from the pro- pellers can also be changed using different gears. No
change on the dynamics is observed when the momentum of inertia is modified.
Some dramatic changes of the shear layer position are observed modifying the
aspect ratio $\Gamma=H/D$. A bifurcation of the shear layer position appears.
Whereas for low $\Gamma$ the shear layer position has a smooth evolution when
turning the asymmetry between the rotation frequency of the propellers, for
high $\Gamma$ the transition becomes abrupt and a symmetry breaking appears.
Secondly we observe that the spontaneous reversals already observed in this ex-
periment for $\Gamma=1$ [de la Torre & Burguete PRL 99, 054101 (2007)] exist
only in a strait window of aspect ratio. We show using an experimental study of

mean flow structure whereas the reversals are linked to the spatial

background given by Advanced LIGO as a new observational window to
independently constrain the abundance of primordial black holes in dark matter.
We show that Advanced LIGO's first observation run gives the best constraint on
the primordial black hole abundance in the mass range $1 M_\odot \lesssim
M_\text{PBH}\lesssim 100 M_\odot$, pushing the previous microlensing and dwarf
galaxy dynamics constraints tighter by 1 order of magnitude. Moreover, we
discuss the possibility to detect the stochastic gravitational-wave background
from primordial black holes, in particular from subsolar mass primordial black
holes, by Advanced LIGO in the near future.

the so-called cloud computing. This technology enables ubiquitous information
management and thus people can access all their data from any place and at any
time. In this landscape, the emergence of cloud storage has had an important
role in the last five years. Nowadays, several free-access public cloud storage
services make it possible for users to have a free backup of their assets and
to manage and share them, representing a low-cost opportunity for Small and
Medium Companies (SME). However, the adoption of cloud storage involves data
outsourcing, so a user does not have the guarantee about the way her data will
be processed and protected. Therefore, it seems necessary to endow public cloud
storage with a set of means to protect users' confidentiality and privacy, to
assess data integrity and to guarantee a proper backup of information assets.
Along this paper we discuss the main challenges to achieve such a goal,
underlining the set of functionalities already implemented in the most popular
public cloud storage services.

  * it does not require the choice of a polarization, aka. the splitting of
classical solutions into positive vs. negative-frequency modes: in fact, any

naturally embedded;

symplectomorphisms of the classical, infinite-dimensional phase space.
  The proposed quantization (like Algebraic QFT) is notably meant for use on
curved spacetimes, where the lack of a preferred choice of polarization makes
the introduction of a Fock representation problematic. Accordingly, we
illustrate it in the simple case of a free Klein-Gordon field on a

accepted theory of gravity and been tested observationally to a very high
precision at different scales of energy and distance. At the same time, there
still remain important questions to resolve. At the classical level
cosmological and black hole singularities are examples of problems which let us
notice that GR is incomplete at short distances (high energy). Furthermore, at
the quantum level GR is not ultraviolet (UV) complete, namely it is not
perturbatively renormalizable. Most of the work try to solve these problems
modifying GR by considering finite higher order derivative terms. Fourth
Derivative Gravity, for example, turns out to be renormalizable, but at the
same time it introduces ghost. To avoid both UV divergence and presence of
ghost one could consider sets of infinite higher derivative terms that can be
expressed in the form of entire functions satisfying the special property do
not introduce new poles other than GR graviton one. By making a special choice
for these entire functions, one could show that such a theory describes a
gravity that, at least in the linear regime, can avoid both the presence of
ghost and classical singularities (both black hole and cosmological
singularities). In this master's thesis we review some of these aspects
regarding gravitational interaction, focusing more on the classical level. Most
of the calculations are done in detail and an extended treatment of the
formalism of the spin projector operators is presented.

magnetic field perturbations, which are oscillatory on the precession
timescale. Extending previous work, we show that these quantities are described
by a set of second-order perturbation equations featuring cross-terms scaling
with the product of the magnetic and centrifugal distortions to the star. For
the case of a background toroidal field, we reduce these to a set of
differential equations in radial functions, and find a method for their
solution. The resulting magnetic-field and velocity perturbations show complex
multipolar structure and are strongest towards the centre of the star.

recent advance which provides a variational solution to a large class of

inference by clipping and perturbing the gradients. The algorithm is made more
efficient through privacy amplification from subsampling. We demonstrate the

important for understanding massive text corpora. Traditionally, systems of
entity relation extraction have relied on human-annotated corpora for training

expertise to be ported to a new domain, and are vulnerable to errors cascading
down the pipeline. In this paper, we investigate joint extraction of typed
entities and relations with labeled data heuristically obtained from knowledge
bases (i.e., distant supervision). As our algorithm for type labeling via
distant supervision is context-agnostic, noisy training data poses unique
challenges for the task. We propose a novel domain-independent framework,
called CoType, that runs a data-driven text segmentation algorithm to extract
entity mentions, and jointly embeds entity mentions, relation mentions, text
features and type labels into two low-dimensional spaces (for entity and
relation mentions respectively), where, in each space, objects whose types are
close will also have similar representations. CoType, then using these learned
embeddings, estimates the types of test (unlinkable) mentions. We formulate a
joint optimization problem to learn embeddings from text corpora and knowledge
bases, adopting a novel partial-label loss function for noisy labeled data and
introducing an object ""translation"" function to capture the cross-constraints
of entities and relations on each other. Experiments on three public datasets
demonstrate the effectiveness of CoType across different domains (e.g., news,
biomedical), with an average of 25% improvement in F1 score compared to the
next best method.

main result is that the length of any 'nontrivial' derivation in such a system
is bound by a polynomial. As a consequence there is no polynomial-time
decidable sound and complete system of linear inferences, unless coNP=NP. We
draw tools and concepts from term rewriting, Boolean function theory and graph
theory in order to access some required intermediate results. At the same time
we make several connections between these areas that, to our knowledge, have
not yet been presented and constitute a rich theoretical framework for
reasoning about linear TRSs for Boolean logic.

arises naturally in a number of contexts, such as business, where we may want
to rank potential projects by profitability; or science, where we may want to
rank variables potentially associated with some trait by the strength of the
association. Most approaches to this problem are empirical Bayesian, where we
use the data to estimate the hyperparameters of the prior distribution, then
use that distribution to estimate the unobserved parameter values. There are a
number of different approaches to this problem, based on different loss
functions for mis-ranking units. However, little has been done on the choice of
prior distribution. Typical approaches involve choosing a conjugate prior for
convenience, and estimating the hyperparameters by MLE from the whole dataset.
In this paper, we look in more detail at the effect of choice of prior
distribution on Bayesian ranking. We focus on the use of posterior mean for
ranking, but many of our conclusions should apply to other ranking criteria,

arrive one by one, each at a node chosen independently and uniformly at random.
If a car arrives at a space which is already occupied, it follows the unique
path oriented towards the root until it encounters an empty space, in which
case it parks there; if there is no empty space, it leaves the tree. Consider
$m =[\alpha n]$ and let $A_{n,\alpha}$ denote the event that all $[\alpha n]$

combinatorics methods) that there is a phase transition in this model. Then if
$\alpha \le 1/2$, we have $\mathbb{P}(A_{n,\alpha}) \to
\frac{\sqrt{1-2\alpha}}{1-\alpha}$, whereas if $\alpha > 1/2$ we have
$\mathbb{P}(A_{n,\alpha}) \to 0$. We give a probabilistic explanation for this
phenomenon, and an alternative proof via the objective method. Along the way,
we are led to consider the following variant of the problem: take the tree to
be the family tree of a Galton-Watson branching process with Poisson(1)
offspring distribution, and let an independent Poisson($\alpha$) number of cars
arrive at each vertex. Let $X$ be the number of cars which visit the root of
the tree. Then for $\alpha \le 1/2$, we have $\mathbb{E}[X] \leq 1$, whereas

third SOC parameter, besides the conventional intrinsic and Rashba

provide effective SOC Hamiltonians both in the local atomic and Bloch forms.
Dilute adsorbate coverage results in the local point group symmetries $C_{6v}$,
$C_{3v}$, and $C_{2v}$ which represent the stable adsorption at hollow, top and

prepare a brief review of the history of the development of the theory, the
experimental attempts to detect them, and the recent direct observations of
gravitational waves (GWs). The theoretical ideas and disputes beginning with
Einstein in 1916 regarding the existence and nature of GWs and the extent to
which one can rely on the electromagnetic analogy, especially the controversies
regarding the quadrupole formula and whether GWs carry energy, are discussed.
The theoretical conclusions eventually received strong observational support
from the binary pulsar. This provided compelling, although indirect, evidence
for GWs carrying away energy--as predicted by the quadrupole formula. On the
direct detection experimental side, Weber started more than 50 years ago. In
1966, his bar for GW detection reached a strain sensitivity of a few times
10^-16. His announcement of coincident signals (now considered spurious)
stimulated many experimental efforts from room temperature resonant masses to
cryogenic detectors and laser-interferometers. Now there are km-sized
interferometric detectors (LIGO Hanford, LIGO Livingston, Virgo and KAGRA).
Advanced LIGO first reached a strain sensitivity of the order of 10^-22. During
their first 130 days of observation (O1 run), with the aid of templates
generated by numerical relativity, they did make the first detections: two
5-sigma GW events and one likely event. Besides earth-based GW detectors, the
drag-free sensitivity of the LISA Pathfinder has already reached to the LISA
goal level, paving the road for space GW detectors. Over the whole GW spectrum
(from aHz to THz) there are efforts for detection, notably the
very-low-frequency band (pulsar timing array [PTA], 300 pHz-100 nHz) and the
extremely-low (Hubble)-frequency (cosmic microwave background [CMB] experiment,
1 aHz-10 fHz).

order closedness of a convex set in $L^\Phi$ characterizes closedness with

and $\sigma(L^\Phi,L^\Psi)$-closedness are indeed equivalent. In general,
however, coincidence of order closedness and $\sigma(L^\Phi,L^\Psi)$-closedness
of convex sets in $L^\Phi$ is equivalent to the validity of the Krein-Smulian

appearance of novel Coding DNA Sequences (CDS) and functions in gene evolution,
by allowing alternative amino acid translations of genes coding regions.
Frameshift translations can be identified by aligning two CDS, from a same gene
or from homologous genes, while accounting for their codon structure. Two main
classes of algorithms have been proposed to solve the problem of aligning CDS,
either by amino acid sequence alignment back-translation, or by simultaneously
accounting for the nucleotide and amino acid levels. The former does not allow
to account for frameshift translations and up to now, the latter exclusively
accounts for frameshift translation initiation, not accounting for the length
of the translation disruption caused by a frameshift.
  Here, we introduce a new scoring scheme with an algorithm for the pairwise
alignment of CDS accounting for frameshift translation initiation and length,
while simultaneously accounting for nucleotide and amino acid sequences. We
compare the method to other CDS alignment methods based on an application to
the comparison of pairs of CDS from homologous \emph{human}, \emph{mouse} and
\emph{cow} genes of ten mammalian gene families from the Ensembl-Compara
database. The results show that our method is particularly robust to parameter
changes as compared to existing methods. It also appears to be a good
compromise, performing well both in the presence and absence of frameshift
translations between the CDS. An implementation of the method is available at

resonances well into the $\mathcal{O}(1)$ TeV range, assuming that the new
resonance decays dominantly to a pair of Standard Model particles. While the SM
pair searches are a vital probe of possible new physics, it is important to
re-examine the scope of new physics scenarios probed with such final states.
Scenarios where new resonances decay dominantly to final states other than SM
pairs, even though well theoretically motivated, lie beyond the scope of SM
pair searches. In this paper we argue that LHC searches for (vector) resonances
beyond two particle final states would be useful complementary probes of new
physics scenarios. As an example, we consider a class of composite Higgs
models, and identify specific model parameter points where the color singlet,
electrically neutral vector resonance $\rho_0$ decays dominantly not to a pair
of SM particles, but to a fermionic top partner $T_{f1}$ and a top quark, with
$T_{f1} \rightarrow tZ$. We show that dominant decays of $\rho_0 \rightarrow
T_{f1} t$ in the context of Composite Higgs models are possible even when the
decay channel to a pair of $T_{f1}$ is kinematically open. Our analysis deals
with scenarios where both $m_\rho$ and $m_{T_{f1}}$ are of $\mathcal{O}(1)$
TeV, leading to highly boosted $t\bar{t}Z$ final state topologies. We show that
the particular composite Higgs scenario we consider is discoverable at the

of the break-up velocity) indicate that some mechanism of angular momentum
regulation must be at play in the early pre-main sequence. We characterize the
rotation properties for members of the region NGC 2264 (~3 Myr), and
investigate the accretion-rotation connection at an age where about 50% of the
stars have already lost their disks. We examined a sample of 500 cluster
members whose photometric variations were monitored in the optical for 38
consecutive days with CoRoT. Light curves were analyzed for periodicity using
the Lomb-Scargle periodogram, the autocorrelation function and the
string-length method. The period distribution obtained for the cluster consists
of a smooth distribution centered around P=5.2 d with two peaks at P=1-2 d and
3-4 d. A separate analysis of CTTS and WTTS indicates that the P=1-2 d peak is
associated with the latter, while both groups contribute to the P=3-4 d peak.
The comparison between CTTS and WTTS supports the idea of a rotation-accretion
connection: their respective rotational properties are statistically different,
and CTTS rotate on average more slowly than WTTS. We also observe a clear
dearth of fast rotators with strong accretion signatures (large UV flux
excess). This is consistent with earlier findings that fast rotators in young
star clusters are typically devoid of dusty disks. Our sample shows some
evidence of a mass dependence in the rotation properties of NGC 2264 members,
lower-mass stars spinning on average faster. This study confirms that disks
influence the rotational evolution of young stars. The idea of disk-locking may
be consistent with the picture of rotation and rotation-accretion connection
that we observe for the NGC 2264 cluster. However, the origin of the several
substructures that we observe in the period distribution deserves further
investigation.

neutrino properties: (i) the total neutrino mass $ M_\nu =\sum_i m_i$; (ii) the
number of relativistic degrees of freedom $N_{eff}$; and (iii) the neutrino
hierarchy: whereas previous literature assumed 3 degenerate neutrino masses or
two massless neutrino species (that do not match neutrino oscillation data), we
study the cases of normal and inverted hierarchy. Our basic result is that
these three neutrino properties induce $< 1 \sigma$ shift of the probability
contours in the $n_s/r$ plane with both current or upcoming data. We find that
the choice of neutrino hierarchy has a negligible impact. However, the minimal
cutoff on the total neutrino mass $M_{\nu,{min}}=0 $ that accompanies previous
works using the degenerate hierarchy does introduce biases in the $n_s/r$ plane
and should be replaced by $M_{\nu,min}= 0.059$ eV as required by oscillation
data. Using current CMB data from Planck and Bicep/Keck, marginalizing over $
M_\nu$ and over $r$ can lead to a shift in the mean value of $n_s$ of
$\sim0.3\sigma$ towards lower values. However, once BAO measurements are
included, the standard contours in the $n_s/r$ plane are basically reproduced.
Larger shifts of the contours in the $n_s/r$ plane (up to 0.8$\sigma$) arise
for nonstandard values of $N_{eff}$. We also provide forecasts for the future
CMB experiments COrE and Stage-IV and show that the incomplete knowledge of
neutrino properties, taken into account by a marginalization over $M_\nu$,
could induce a shift of $\sim0.4\sigma$ towards lower values in the
determination of $n_s$ (or a $\sim 0.8\sigma$ shift if one marginalizes over
$N_{eff}$). Comparison to specific inflationary models is shown.

propensity for motion at long times is independent of the rate or strength of a
molecule's beta relaxation. The mobility of a molecule averaged over many
initial energies, a measure of the influence of structure, was found to be
heterogeneous, with clustering at both the beta and alpha timescales. This
heterogeneity is less extended spatially for the beta than for the alpha
dynamics, as expected; however, the local structure is the more dominant
control parameter for the beta prcoess. In the glassy state, the arrangement of
neighboring molecules determines entirely the relaxation properties, with no
discernible effect from the particle momenta.

This is
achieved by coupling the SM to a monodromy axion field through Minkowski
3-forms. The Higgs mass scans with steps given by delta(m_H^2)= eta mu f, where
mu and f are the axion mass and periodicity respectively, and eta measures the
coupling of the Higgs to the associated 3-form. The observed Higgs mass scale
could then be selected on anthropic grounds. The monodromy axion may have a
mass mu in a very wide range depending on the value of eta, and the axion
periodity f. For eta=1 and f = 10^10 GeV, one has 10^{-3}eV < mu < 10^3 eV, but
ultralight axions with e.g. mu = 10^{-17} eV are also possible. In a different
realization we consider landscape models coupled to the MSSM. In the context of
SUSY, 4-forms appear as being part of the auxiliary fields of SUSY multiplets.
The scanning in the 4-forms thus translate into a landscape of vevs for the N=1
auxiliary fields and hence as a landscape for the soft terms. This could
provide a rationale for the MSSM fine-tuning suggested by LHC data. In all
these models there are 3-forms coupling to membranes which induce transitions
between different vacua through bubble nucleation. The Weak Gravity Conjecture
(WGC) set limits on the tension of these membranes and implies new physics
thresholds well below the Planck scale. More generaly, we argue that in the
case of string SUSY vacua in which the Goldstino multiplet contains a monodromy
axion the WGC suggests a lower bound on the SUSY breaking scale m_{3/2} >

last decade. Despite the plethora of models and formulations, there is a lack
of a simple model which aims to project the set of patterns into a space
defined by the classes (or categories). To this end, we set up a model in which
each class is represented as a 1D subspace of the vector space formed by the
features. Assuming the set of classes does not exceed the cardinality of the
features, the model results in multi-class supervised learning in which the
features of each class are projected into the class subspace. Class
discrimination is automatically guaranteed via the imposition of orthogonality
of the 1D class sub-spaces. The resulting optimization problem - formulated as
the minimization of a sum of quadratic functions on a Stiefel manifold - while
being non-convex (due to the constraints), nevertheless has a structure for
which we can identify when we have reached a global minimum. After formulating
a version with standard inner products, we extend the formulation to
reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces in a straightforward manner. The optimization
approach also extends in a similar fashion to the kernel version. Results and
comparisons with the multi-class Fisher linear (and kernel) discriminants and
principal component analysis (linear and kernel) showcase the relative merits
of this approach to dimensionality reduction.

features explicit message-passing primitives and lightweight threads, enabling
(and encouraging) programmers to develop concurrent systems where components
interact through communication more so than by lock-based shared memory
concurrency. Go can only detect global deadlocks at runtime, but provides no
compile-time protection against all too common communication mismatches or
partial deadlocks. This work develops a static verification framework for
liveness and safety in Go programs, able to detect communication errors and
partial deadlocks in a general class of realistic concurrent programs,
including those with dynamic channel creation, unbounded thread creation and
recursion. Our approach infers from a Go program a faithful representation of
its communication patterns as a behavioural type. By checking a syntactic
restriction on channel usage, dubbed fencing, we ensure that programs are made
up of finitely many different communication patterns that may be repeated
infinitely many times. This restriction allows us to implement procedures to
check for liveness and safety in types which in turn approximates liveness and
safety in Go programs. We have implemented a type inference and liveness and
safety checks in a tool-chain and tested it against publicly available Go
programs.

algorithm that provides timely and granular assessments for the clinical acuity
of ward patients based on their (temporal) lab tests and vital signs; the
proposed risk scoring system ensures timely intensive care unit (ICU)
admissions for clinically deteriorating patients. Methods: The risk scoring
system learns a set of latent patient subtypes from the offline electronic
health record data, and trains a mixture of Gaussian Process (GP) experts,
where each expert models the physiological data streams associated with a
specific patient subtype. Transfer learning techniques are used to learn the
relationship between a patient's latent subtype and her static admission
information (e.g. age, gender, transfer status, ICD-9 codes, etc). Results:
Experiments conducted on data from a heterogeneous cohort of 6,321 patients
admitted to Ronald Reagan UCLA medical center show that our risk score
significantly and consistently outperforms the currently deployed risk scores,
such as the Rothman index, MEWS, APACHE and SOFA scores, in terms of
timeliness, true positive rate (TPR), and positive predictive value (PPV).
Conclusion: Our results reflect the importance of adopting the concepts of
personalized medicine in critical care settings; significant accuracy and
timeliness gains can be achieved by accounting for the patients' heterogeneity.
Significance: The proposed risk scoring methodology can confer huge clinical
and social benefits on more than 200,000 critically ill inpatient who exhibit

considering the effects of disk winds, radiation pressure, photoevaporation and
stellar winds, while following protostellar evolution in collapsing massive gas
cores. We find that disk winds are the dominant feedback mechanism setting star
formation efficiencies (SFEs) from initial cores of ~0.3-0.5. However,
radiation pressure is also significant to widen the outflow cavity causing
reductions of SFE compared to the disk-wind only case, especially for >100Msun
star formation at clump mass surface densities Sigma<0.3g/cm2. Photoevaporation
is of relatively minor importance due to dust attenuation of ionizing photons.
Stellar winds have even smaller effects during the accretion stage. For core
masses Mc~10-1000Msun and Sigma~0.1-3g/cm2, we find the overall SFE to be
0.31(Rc/0.1pc)^{-0.39}, potentially a useful sub-grid star-formation model in
simulations that can resolve pre-stellar core radii,
Rc=0.057(Mc/60Msun)^{1/2}(Sigma/g/cm2)^{-1/2}pc. The decline of SFE with Mc is
gradual with no evidence for a maximum stellar-mass set by feedback processes
up to stellar masses of ~300Msun. We thus conclude that the observed truncation
of the high-mass end of the IMF is shaped mostly by the pre-stellar core mass
function or internal stellar processes. To form massive stars with the observed
maximum masses of ~150-300Msun, initial core masses need to be >500-1000Msun.
We also apply our feedback model to zero-metallicity primordial star formation,
showing that, in the absence of dust, photoevaporation staunches accretion at
~50Msun. Our model implies radiative feedback is most significant at
metallicities ~10^{-2}Zsun, since both radiation pressure and photoevaporation
are effective in this regime.

still remain elusive. By performing molecular dynamics (MD) simulations at
varying DMSO concentrations ($X_{\text{DMSO}}$), we study how DMSO affects
structural and dynamical properties of water in the vicinity of phospholipid
bilayers. As proposed by a number of experiments, our simulations confirm that
DMSO induces dehydration from bilayer surfaces and disrupts the H-bond
structure of water. However, DMSO enhanced water diffusivity at solvent-bilayer
interfaces, an intriguing discovery reported by a spin-label measurement, is
not confirmed in our simulations. In order to resolve this discrepancy, we
examine the location of the spin-label (Tempo), relative to the solvent-bilayer
interface. In accord with the evidence in the literature, our simulations,
which explicitly model Tempo-PC, find that the Tempo moiety is equilibrated at
$\sim 8-10$ \AA\ \emph{below} the bilayer surface. Furthermore, the
DMSO-enhanced surface water diffusion is confirmed only when water diffusion is
analyzed around the Tempo moiety that is immersed below the bilayer surface,
which implies that the experimentally detected signal of water using Tempo
stems from the interior of bilayers, not from the interface. Our analysis finds
that the increase of water diffusion below the bilayer surface is coupled to
the increase of area per lipid with an increasing $X_{\text{DMSO}}$ $(\lesssim
10\text{ mol\%})$. Underscoring the hydrophobic nature of Tempo moiety, our
study calls for careful re-evaluation of the use of Tempo in the measurement on
lipid bilayer surfaces.

predicted to occur, yielding different VCMA response. According to our

measure the local distortion at that location. The local distortion map across
the image is simultaneously fit to our distortion model, which includes thermal
drift in addition to piezoelectric actuator hysteresis and creep. The image
coordinates of the features and image pixels are corrected using an inverse
transform from the distortion model. We call this technique the thermal-drift,

allows defects, domain boundaries, and step edges to be excluded with a spatial

arranged from the data sequence) speeds up the global solution and achieves
noise reduction. On the other hand, topology preservation (achieved by
monitoring the Jacobian determinant) allows to radically rule out distortions
while carefully controlling the size of allowed expansions and contractions.
Our variational approach is carried out on a realistic dataset as well as on a
simulated one. We demonstrate how our proposed variational solution deals with
complex deformations through careful numerical experiments. While maintaining
the accuracy of the solution, the low-rank preprocessing is shown to speed up
the convergence of the variational problem. Beyond cardiac motion estimation,
our approach is promising for the analysis of other organs that experience
motion.

  Diverse IoT Applications",,,,,"cs.IT math.IT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  IEEE 802.15.4 takes a center stage in IoT as Low- Rate Wireless Personal Area
Networks(LR-WPANs). The standard specifies Offset Quadrature Phase Shift Keying
Physical Layer (O-QPSK PHY) with half-sine pulse shaping which can be either
analyzed under the class of M-ary PSK signals (QPSK signal with offset) or as
Minimum Shift Keying (MSK) signal. M-ary PSK demodulation is requires perfect
carrier and has minimal error. MSK signals which falls under Continuous Phase
Frequency Shift Keying can be demodulated non-coherently but error performance
is not as good. In our paper, this dual nature of IEEE 802.15.4 PHY is
exploited to propose a dual mode receiver comprising of QPSK demodulator chain
and MSK demodulator chain as a single system on chip. The mode can be
configured manually depending on the type of application or based on the
feedback from a Signal to Noise (SNR) indicator employed in the proposed
receiver. M-ary PSK chain is selected for lower SNRs and MSK for higher SNRs.
Each of these properties are analyzed in detail for both demodulator chains and
we go on to prove that MSK detection can be used for low power, low complex and
low latency while QPSK detection is employed for minimal error.

extension of the quartic Fermi-Pasta-Ulam (FPU) chain of anharmonic
oscillators. The coupling in the linear term decays as a power-law with an
exponent greater than 1 and less than 3. We obtain an analytic perturbative
expression of traveling envelope solitons by introducing a Non Linear
Schrodinger (NLS) equation for the slowly varying amplitude of short wavelength
modes. Due to the non analytic properties of the dispersion relation, it is
crucial to develop the theory using discrete difference operators. Those
properties are also the ultimate reason why kink-solitons may exist but are
unstable, at variance with the short-range FPU model. We successfully compare
these approximate analytic results with numerical simulations.

relativistic wave equations, namely, for the Klein-Gordon and Dirac equations.
The results are obtained by solving of a Riemann-type equation whose solution
can be written in terms of hypergeometric function $\,_{2}F_{1}(a,b;c;z)$. The
energy eigenvalue equations and the corresponding normalized wave functions are
given both for two wave equations. The results for some special cases including
the Manning-Rosen potential, the Hulth\'{e}n potential and the Coulomb
potential are also discussed by setting the parameters as required.

economist to political science and philosophy. A confession of the weaknesses
of the political position of the economist. It is intended as a guide for
political scientists and philosophers to the ostensible policy criteria of
economics, and an illustration of an argument that demonstrates
logico-mathematically, therefore incontrovertibly, that any policy statement by
an economist contains, or is, a political statement. It develops an inescapable
compulsion that the absolute primacy and priority of political theory and
philosophy in the development of policy criteria must be recognised. Economic
policy cannot be divorced from politics as a matter of mathematical fact, and
rather, as Amartya Sen has done, it ought embrace political theory and
philosophy.
