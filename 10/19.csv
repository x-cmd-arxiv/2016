two-dimensional fluid and plasma theories. The Hamiltonian systems considered,
namely the Euler, Vlasov-Poisson, Hasegawa-Mima, and modified Hasegawa-Mima
equations, are naturally described in terms of noncanonical variables. The
beatification procedure amounts to finding the correct transformation that
removes the explicit variable dependence from a noncanonical Poisson bracket
and replaces it with a fixed dependence on a chosen state in phase space. As
such, beatification is a major step toward casting the Hamiltonian system in
its canonical form, thus enabling or facilitating the use of analytical and
numerical techniques that require or favor a representation in terms of
canonical, or beatified, Hamiltonian variables.

four possible pulsating white dwarf/subdwarf sources and an eclipsing
cataclysmic variable. Due to their rarity, these targets are ideal candidates
for detailed follow-up studies. From spectroscopy, we confirm the symbiotic
binary star nature of two variables identified as such in the SIMBAD database.

reflection and the two dominant absorption components identified by Kraemer et
al. (2005), hereafter KRA2005, X-High and D+Ea, which are present in all
epochs. The model fittings suggest that the absorbers are very stable, with the
principal changes in the intrinsic absorption resulting from variations in the
ionization state of the gas as the ionizing continuum varies. However, the low
states show evidence of larger column densities in one or both of the
absorbers. Among plausible explanations for the column increase, we discuss the
possibility of an expanding/contracting X-ray corona. As suggested by KRA2005,
there seem to be contributions from magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) winds to the mass
outflow. Along with the ultra fast outflow absorber identified by Tombesi et
al. (2010), X-High is consistent with being magnetically driven. On the other
hand, it is unlikely that D+Ea is part of the MHD flow, and it is possible that
it is radiatively accelerated. These results suggest that at a sufficiently
large radial distance there is a break point between MHD-dominated and

spectrum characterized by asymmetric and blue-shifted emission lines. Here we
investigate the origin of these asymmetries through three-dimensional
hydrodynamic simulations describing the outburst during the first 20 days of
evolution. The model takes into account thermal conduction and radiative
cooling and assumes a blast wave propagates through an equatorial density
enhancement. From the simulations, we synthesize the X-ray emission and derive
the spectra as they would be observed with Chandra. We find that both the blast
wave and the ejecta distribution are efficiently collimated in polar directions
due to the presence of the equatorial density enhancement. The majority of the
X-ray emission originates from the interaction of the blast with the equatorial
density enhancement and is concentrated on the equatorial plane as a ring-like
structure. Our ""best-fit"" model requires a mass of ejecta in the outburst
$M_{ej} \approx 3\times 10^{-7}\,M_{\odot}$ and an explosion energy $E_b
\approx 3 \times 10^{43}$ erg and reproduces the distribution of emission
measure vs temperature and the evolution of shock velocity and temperature
inferred from the observations. The model predicts asymmetric and blue-shifted
line profiles similar to those observed and explains their origin as due to
substantial X-ray absorption of red-shifted emission by ejecta material. The
comparison of predicted and observed Ne and O spectral line ratios reveals no
signs of strong Ne enhancement and suggests the progenitor is a CO white dwarf.

spatiotemporal structure of an action invariant to motion, velocity, and scene
context. Solely based on the spatiotemporal interactions between manipulated
objects and hands in the extracted SEC, the framework automatically parses
individual manipulation streams performed either sequentially or concurrently.
Using event chains, our method further extracts basic primitive elements of
each parsed manipulation. Without requiring any prior object knowledge, the
proposed framework can also extract object-like scene entities that exhibit the
same role in semantically similar manipulations. We conduct extensive
experiments on various recent datasets to validate the robustness of the
framework.

nonparametric procedures in the L-moment homogeneity test. To assess the
rejection threshold, three resampling methods (permutation, bootstrap and
P\'olya resampling) are considered. Results indicate that permutation and
bootstrap methods perform better than the parametric Hosking-Wallis test in
terms of power as well as in time and procedure simplicity. A real-world case
study shows that the nonparametric tests agree with the HW test concerning the
homogeneity of the volume and the bivariate case while they disagree for the
peak case, but that the assumptions of the HW test are not well respected.

the structure of the Galactic Bulge. Due to the large number of expected
sources, this requires an automated mechanism for selecting RR Lyrae,and
particularly those of the more easily recognized type ab (i.e.,
fundamental-mode pulsators), from the 10^6-10^7 variables expected in the VVV
survey area. In this work we describe a supervised machine-learned classifier
constructed for assigning a score to a K_s-band VVV light curve that indicates
its likelihood of being ab-type RR Lyrae. We describe the key steps in the
construction of the classifier, which were the choice of features, training
set, selection of aperture and family of classifiers. We find that the AdaBoost
family of classifiers give consistently the best performance for our problem,
and obtain a classifier based on the AdaBoost algorithm that achieves a
harmonic mean between false positives and false negatives of ~7% for typical
VVV light curve sets. This performance is estimated using cross-validation and
through the comparison to two independent datasets that were classified by
human experts.

convex optimization assumes that the gradient of the objective function is
uniformly smooth with some Lipschitz constant $L$. However, in many settings
the differentiable convex function $f(\cdot)$ is not uniformly smooth -- for
example in $D$-optimal design where $f(x):=-\ln \det(HXH^T)$, or even the
univariate setting with $f(x) := -\ln(x) + x^2$. Herein we develop a notion of
""relative smoothness"" and relative strong convexity that is determined relative
to a user-specified ""reference function"" $h(\cdot)$ (that should be
computationally tractable for algorithms), and we show that many differentiable
convex functions are relatively smooth with respect to a correspondingly
fairly-simple reference function $h(\cdot)$. We extend two standard algorithms
-- the primal gradient scheme and the dual averaging scheme -- to our new
setting, with associated computational guarantees. We apply our new approach to
develop a new first-order method for the $D$-optimal design problem, with
associated computational complexity analysis. Some of our results have a
certain overlap with the recent work \cite{bbt}.

development by introducing new challenges due to the limited resources of
mobile devices, e.g., memory, CPU, network bandwidth and battery. The energy
consumption of mobile apps is nowadays a hot topic and researchers are actively
investigating the role of coding practices on energy efficiency. Recent studies
suggest that design quality can conflict with energy efficiency. Therefore, it
is important to take into account energy efficiency when evolving the design of
a mobile app. The research community has proposed approaches to detect and
remove anti-patterns (i.e., poor solutions to design and implementation
problems) in software systems but, to the best of our knowledge, none of these
approaches have included anti-patterns that are specific to mobile apps and--or
considered the energy efficiency of apps. In this paper, we fill this gap in
the literature by analyzing the impact of eight type of anti-patterns on a
testbed of 59 android apps extracted from F-Droid. First, we (1) analyze the
impact of anti-patterns in mobile apps with respect to energy efficiency; then
(2) we study the impact of different types of anti-patterns on energy
efficiency. We found that then energy consumption of apps containing
anti-patterns and not (refactored apps) is statistically different. Moreover,
we find that the impact of refactoring anti-patterns can be positive (7 type of
anti-patterns) or negative (2 type of anti-patterns). Therefore, developers
should consider the impact on energy efficiency of refactoring when applying
maintenance activities.

suggest that selectivity is related to constraints that potential ligands
encounter on their way from the surface of the protein to their final position

about ligand binding, distinguishing binders from non-binders, and suggests
that binding is a three-step mechanism, consisting of engagement with a niche
in the back wall of the pocket, interaction with a molecular filter which
allows or precludes further descent of ligands, and binding on the pocket base.
Only molecules that are able to descend the pocket and bind at its base allow
the co-receptor IAA7 to bind on the complex, thus behaving as active auxins.
Analyzing the interactions at different depths, our new method helps in
identifying critical residues that constitute preferred future study targets
and in the quest for safe and effective herbicides. Also, it has the potential
to extend the utility of docking from ligand searches to the study of processes

activities called neural bursts, which can be important in the organization of
functional neural circuits. Before the network matures, the activity level of a
burst can reverberate in repeated rise-and-falls in periods of hundreds of
milliseconds following an initial wave-like propagation of spiking activity,
while the burst itself lasts for seconds. To investigate the spatiotemporal
structure of the reverberatory bursts, we culture dissociated, rat cortical
neurons on a high-density multi-electrode array to record the dynamics of
neural activity over the growth and maturation of the network. We find the
synchrony of the spiking significantly reduced following the initial wave and
the activities become broadly distributed spatially. The synchrony recovers as
the system reverberates until the end of the burst. Using a propagation model
we infer the spreading speed of the spiking activity, which increases as the
culture ages. We perform computer simulations of the system using a
physiological model of spiking networks in two spatial dimensions and find the
parameters that reproduce the observed resynchronization of spiking in the
bursts. An analysis of the simulated dynamics suggests that the depletion of
synaptic resources causes the resynchronization. The spatial propagation
dynamics of the simulations match well with observations over the course of a
burst and point to an interplay of the synaptic efficacy and the noisy neural
self-activation in producing the morphology of the bursts.

a continuous feature space into unique regions according to the desired
discretization per dimension. While simple, this algorithm has a main drawback:
it cannot scale to high-dimensional feature spaces since the number of regions
increase exponentially with the number of dimensions. In this paper, we address
this limitation by introducing a simple extension of MAP-Elites that has a
constant, pre-defined number of regions irrespective of the dimensionality of
the feature space. Our main insight is that methods from computational geometry
could partition a high-dimensional space into well-spread geometric regions. In
particular, our algorithm uses a centroidal Voronoi tessellation (CVT) to
divide the feature space into a desired number of regions; it then places every
generated individual in its closest region, replacing a less fit one if the
region is already occupied. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the new

comparisons against MAP-Elites in maze navigation and hexapod locomotion tasks.

to represent any computable probability distribution. Unfortunately,
probabilistic program inference is often intractable, and existing PPLs mostly
rely on expensive, approximate sampling-based methods. To alleviate this
problem, one could try to learn from past inferences, so that future inferences
run faster. This strategy is known as amortized inference; it has recently been
applied to Bayesian networks and deep generative models. This paper proposes a
system for amortized inference in PPLs. In our system, amortization comes in
the form of a parameterized guide program. Guide programs have similar
structure to the original program, but can have richer data flow, including
neural network components. These networks can be optimized so that the guide
approximately samples from the posterior distribution defined by the original
program. We present a flexible interface for defining guide programs and a
stochastic gradient-based scheme for optimizing guide parameters, as well as
some preliminary results on automatically deriving guide programs. We explore
in detail the common machine learning pattern in which a 'local' model is
specified by 'global' random values and used to generate independent observed
data points; this gives rise to amortized local inference supporting global
model learning.

subsets of users. Because they rely directly on sensitive data, these models
are not published, but instead used as ""teachers"" for a ""student"" model. The
student learns to predict an output chosen by noisy voting among all of the
teachers, and cannot directly access an individual teacher or the underlying
data or parameters. The student's privacy properties can be understood both
intuitively (since no single teacher and thus no single dataset dictates the
student's training) and formally, in terms of differential privacy. These
properties hold even if an adversary can not only query the student but also
inspect its internal workings.
  Compared with previous work, the approach imposes only weak assumptions on
how teachers are trained: it applies to any model, including non-convex models
like DNNs. We achieve state-of-the-art privacy/utility trade-offs on MNIST and
SVHN thanks to an improved privacy analysis and semi-supervised learning.

was discovered: it supposedly describes an asymptotically flat twisted black

the frame dragging in the northern hemisphere is opposite from that of the
southern hemisphere, which results in a globally vanishing angular momentum.
Furthermore it was shown that the spacetime has no curvature singularity. We
show that the geometry of this black hole spacetime is nevertheless not free of
pathological features. In particular, it harbors a rather drastic conical
singularity along the axis of rotation. In addition, there exist closed
timelike curves due to the fact that the constant r and constant t surfaces are
not globally Riemannian. In fact, none of these are that surprising since the
solution is just the Taub-NUT geometry. As such, despite the original claim
that the twisted black hole might have observational consequences, it cannot
be.

different sensing applications when a single sensor cannot provide enough
measurements for a high-quality reconstruction. In this paper, we consider
compressed sensing (CS) for parallel acquisition systems when the individual
sensors use subgaussian random sampling. Our main results are a series of
uniform recovery guarantees which relate the number of measurements required to
the basis in which the solution is sparse and certain characteristics of the
multi-sensor system, known as sensor profile matrices. In particular, we derive
sufficient conditions for optimal recovery, in the sense that the number of
measurements required per sensor decreases linearly with the total number of
sensors, and demonstrate explicit examples of multi-sensor systems for which
this holds. We establish these results by proving the so-called Asymmetric
Restricted Isometry Property (ARIP) for the sensing system and use this to
derive both nonuniversal and universal recovery guarantees. Compared to
existing work, our results not only lead to better stability and robustness
estimates but also provide simpler and sharper constants in the measurement
conditions. Finally, we show how the problem of CS with block-diagonal sensing
matrices can be viewed as a particular case of our multi-sensor framework.
Specializing our results to this setting leads to a recovery guarantee that is
at least as good as existing results.

stars. Over the past decade, significant progress has been made by both space-

are hosts to closely-packed planetary systems characterized by a paucity of
Jupiter-mass planets and the presence of multiple rocky planets, with roughly a
third of these rocky M-dwarf planets orbiting within the habitable zone, where
they have the potential to support liquid water on their surfaces. Theoretical
studies have also quantified the effect on climate and habitability of the

useful in surveys where individual galaxies are not resolved, as in 21cm
intensity mapping observations. We validate this method by reconstructing mock
pixelated maps, that we build from the distribution of matter and halos in

most intimate detail, fits in amongst other galaxies. Key examples include the
Tully-Fisher relation (TFR) --- i.e., the tight correlation between luminosity
($L$) and rotational velocity ($V_\textrm{rot}$) --- and the 3-dimensional
luminosity-velocity-radius ($LVR$) scaling relation. Several past studies have
characterized the MW as a 1--1.5$\sigma$ outlier to the TFR. This study
reexamines such comparisons using new estimates of MW properties that are
robust to many of the systematic uncertainties that have been a problem in the
past and are based on assumptions consistent with those used for other spiral
galaxies. Comparing to scaling relations derived from modern extragalactic
data, we find that our Galaxy's properties are in excellent agreement with TFRs
defined using any SDSS-filter absolute magnitude, stellar mass, or baryonic
mass as the $L$ proxy. We next utilize disk scale length ($R_\textrm{d}$)
measurements to extend this investigation to the $LVR$ relation. Here we find
that our Galaxy lies farther from the relation than $\sim$90\% of other spiral
galaxies, yielding $\sim$9.5$\sigma$ evidence that it is unusually compact for
its $L$ and $V_\textrm{rot}$ (based on MW errors alone), a result that holds
for all of the $L$ proxies considered. The expected $R_\textrm{d}$ for the MW
from the $LVR$ relation is $\sim$5 kpc, nearly twice as large as the observed
value, with error estimates placing the two in tension at the $\sim$1.4$\sigma$
level. The compact scale length of the Galactic disk could be related to other
ways in which the MW has been found to be anomalous.

comparable only if the disk temperature color correction factor changes, an
effect that could be due to the changing opacity of the disk caused by changes
in metal abundances. The disk inclination is similar to that inferred from the

the most likely path of any ion crossing a medium between two detection points.
The path is predicted based on a combination of the particle scattering in the
material and measurements of its initial and final position, direction and
energy. The path estimate's precision is compared to the Monte Carlo simulated
path. Every ion from hydrogen to carbon is simulated in two scenarios to
estimate the accuracy achievable: one where the range is fixed and one where
the initial velocity is fixed. In the scenario where the range is kept
constant, the maximal root-mean-square error between the estimated path and the
Monte Carlo path drops significantly between the proton path estimate (0.50 mm)
and the helium path estimate (0.18 mm), but less so up to the carbon path
estimate (0.09 mm). In the scenario where the initial velocity is kept
constant, helium have systematically the minimal root-mean-square error
throughout the path. As a result, helium is found to be the optimal particle
for ion imaging.

temperature fluctuations up to multipole $\ell<40$, we in this paper try to
explain such feature by investigating case of punctuated inflation scenario.
This form of inflation potential is inspired by Minimal Super-symmetric
Standard Model (MSSM) wherein suppression of curvature perturbation power at
large scales is produced by introducing period of fast-roll phase of the
inflation sandwiched between two stages of slow-roll phase.
  We apply Markov Chain Monte Carlo analysis to determine posterior
distribution and the best fit values of the model parameters using recent WMAP9
and Planck data. We show that WMAP9 and Planck results are consistent with each
other and that with Planck data we obtain tighter constraints for punctuated
inflation parameters. We find that punctuated inflation leads to better fit in
CMB data compared to simple power law model. The improvement in the fit to the
WMAP9 data is $\Delta \chi^2\sim 3.6$ and for Planck the improvement is $\Delta
\chi^2\sim 5.4$. We find that $AIC$ does not discriminate between punctuated
inflation and simple power law model for WMAP9 data. However, for Planck data
we find that punctuated inflation is moderately preferred over a simple power
law model.

evolution of galaxy population in a cosmological context. However, most models
over-predict the number of low-mass galaxies at high redshifts and the color of
model galaxies are not right in the sense that low-mass satellite galaxies are
too red and centrals are too blue. The recent version of the L-Galaxies model
by Henriques et al.(H15) is a step forward to solve these problems by
reproducing the evolution of stellar mass function and the overall fraction of
red galaxies. In this paper we compare the two model predictions of L-Galaxies
(the other is Guo et al. , G13) to the SDSS data in detail. We find that in the
H15 model the red fraction of central galaxies now agrees with the data due to
their implementation of strong AGN feedback, but the stellar mass of centrals
in massive haloes is now slightly lower than the data. For satellite galaxies,
the red fraction of low-mass galaxies ($\log M_{*}/M_{\odot} < 10$) also agrees
with the data, but the color of massive satellites ($10 < \log M_{*}/M_{\odot}
< 11$) is slightly bluer. The correct color of centrals and bluer color of
massive satellites indicate that the quenching in massive satellites are not
strong enough. We also find that there are too much red spirals and less
bulge-dominated galaxies in both H15 and G13 models. Our results suggest that
additional mechanisms, such as more minor merger or disk instability, are
needed to slightly increase the stellar mass of central galaxy in massive
galaxies, mainly in the bulge component, and the bulge dominated galaxy will be
quenched or then be quenched by any other mechanisms.

business concepts used in definition of business processes. The proposed human
task monitoring and contextual analysis (HTMCA) component considers multiple
artifacts involved in the execution of a human task, rather than focusing only
on classic activity/task metrics retrieved from BPM engines.This approach
aspires to provide two main advantages to organizations using it. Firstly, it
enhances the understanding of the workload of human users that participate in
people-intensive business processes under various roles. Secondly, it gives
organizations tools and insight for fine-tuning their user performance taking
into account the specific context of their business various artifacts domains.
The proposed framework builds on previous work that lays the basis of
vendor-independent, concept-centric BPM monitoring, and provides the critical
missing element of human task understanding. This has the potential to
significantly benefit any BPM deployment and the validation work is in advanced
stages of building a full prototype that demonstrates this value in a realistic

an explanation of some phenomenological (macroscopic) aspects of tumor, as the

formulation. The model proposed here is based on a simple principle:
competitive interaction between the cells dependent on their mutual distances.
As a result, we reproduce many empirical evidences observed in real tumors, as
exponential growth in their early stages followed by a power law growth. The
model also reproduces the fractal space distribution of tumor cells and the
universal behavior presented in animals and tumor growth, conform reported by
West, Guiot {\it et. al.}\cite{West2001,Guiot2003}. The results suggest that
the universal similarity between tumor and animal growth comes from the fact

storm particle (ESP) event was an order of magnitude larger, making it the most
intense event in the space era at these energies. By a detailed analysis of the

consistent with a high-energy SEP event (accelerating particles to GeV
energies). The time of maximum and fluence spectra in the range 10-100 MeV were
very hard, similar to those of ground level enhancement (GLE) events. We found
a hierarchical relationship between the CME initial speeds and the fluence
spectral indices: CMEs with low initial speeds had SEP events with the softest

hardest spectra. CMEs attaining intermediate speeds result in moderately hard
spectra. The July 23 event was in the group of hard-spectrum events. During the
July 23 event, the shock speed (>2000 km s^-1), the initial acceleration (~1.70

conformal mapping between scattering geometries. The correspondence is valid to
all orders of perturbation theory and in this way provides one with a proof of
rapidity renormalization procedure for multiparton scattering (including the
transverse momentum dependent (TMD) factorization as a special case). As a
by-product, we obtain an exact relation between the rapidity anomalous

We propose alternative ""big batch"" SGD schemes that adaptively grow the batch

as the large `missing' fraction of electrons in cosmic rays and their contrast
to the charge-neutral solar wind, the extreme energy sources that sustain
pulsars, quasars, galactic jets and active galactic nuclei (AGN), the origin
and nature of `dark matter' galaxy haloes, and the apparent acceleration of the
expansion of the Universe. When there are $\sim \num{9e-19}$ amounts of excess
$\ce{H3+}$ or $\ce{H-}$ within cold diffuse clouds of $\ce{H2}$, residual
repulsive Coulomb forces between these few unbalanced charges are comparable to
the gravitational attractions between the many nucleons. Thus, trace-charged
dark matter is inert with respect to static electrogravitional
self-attractions, but responds to electromagnetic fields and gravitational
attractions with uncharged matter. Trace charge is also the ionic catalyst that
keeps dark matter in the state of unseen clouds of cold molecular hydrogen plus
trace $\ce{H3+}$. Once warm enough to partially ionize, bright matter
preferentially expels its net charge to become nearly charge-neutral. Planets
surrounding stars become charge neutral as they bathe in a charge-neutral
stellar wind. In contrast, around trace-charged AGNs, black holes, and
pulsars,newly ionized protons along with a significant fraction of entrained
dark matter are Coulomb-expelled to relativistic velocities in polar jets.
Extrasolar cosmic rays generated by these would be strongly proton-dominated,
as observed. Initial trace charge imbalances could originate at the onset of
the the Big Bang by segregation of an electron-rich shell to peripheral
expanding matter of the Universe.

The application sought is to the process of transmission of infection in
epidemics. The walkers are animals such as rodents in considerations of the
Hantavirus epidemic, infected or susceptible, the reaction is the transmission
of infection, and the confining potential represents the tendency of the
animals to stay in the neighborhood of their home range centers. Calculations
are based on a recently developed formalism (Kenkre and Sugaya, Bull. Math.
Bio. 76, 3016 (2014)) structured around analytic solutions of a Smoluchowski
equation and one of its aims is the resolution of peculiar but well-known
problems of reaction-diffusion theory in 2-dimensions. In the present analysis,
reaction occurs not at points but in spatial regions of dimensions larger than
0. The analysis uncovers interesting nonintuitive phenomena one of which is
similar to that encountered in the 1-dimensional analysis given in the quoted
article, and another specific to the fact that the reaction region is spatially
extended. The analysis additionally provides a realistic description of
observations on animals transmitting infection while moving on what is
effectively a 2-dimensional landscape. Along with the general formalism and

updating lumber quality monitoring procedures in American Society for Testing
and Materials (ASTM) Standard D1990 (adopted in 1991) from time to time. A key
component of monitoring is an effective method for detecting the change in
lower percentiles of the solid lumber strength based on multiple samples. In a
recent study by Verrill et al.\ (2015), eight statistical tests proposed by
wood scientists were examined thoroughly based on real and simulated data sets.
These tests are found unsatisfactory in differing aspects such as seriously
inflated false alarm rate when observations are clustered, suboptimal power
properties, or having inconvenient ad hoc rejection regions. A contributing
factor behind suboptimal performance is that most of these tests are not
developed to detect the change in quantiles. In this paper, we use a
nonparametric random effects model to handle the within cluster correlations,
composite empirical likelihood to avoid explicit modelling of the correlations
structure, and a density ratio model to combine the information from multiple
samples. In addition, we propose a cluster-based bootstrapping procedure to
construct the monitoring test on quantiles which satisfactorily controls the
type I error in the presence of within cluster correlation. The performance of
the test is examined through simulation experiments and a real world example.
The new method is generally applicable, not confined to the motivating example.

acoustic models. However, compared to Gaussian mixture models, deep neural
network (DNN) based acoustic models often have many more model parameters,
making it challenging for them to be deployed on resource-constrained
platforms, such as mobile devices. In this paper, we study the application of
the recently proposed highway deep neural network (HDNN) for training
small-footprint acoustic models. HDNNs are a depth-gated feedforward neural
network, which include two types of gate functions to facilitate the
information flow through different layers. Our study demonstrates that HDNNs
are more compact than regular DNNs for acoustic modeling, i.e., they can
achieve comparable recognition accuracy with many fewer model parameters.
Furthermore, HDNNs are more controllable than DNNs: the gate functions of an
HDNN can control the behavior of the whole network using a very small number of
model parameters. Finally, we show that HDNNs are more adaptable than DNNs. For
example, simply updating the gate functions using adaptation data can result in
considerable gains in accuracy. We demonstrate these aspects by experiments
using the publicly available AMI corpus, which has around 80 hours of training
data.

frequency or breaches and corresponding privacy impact have been rising
accordingly. One way to mitigate this risk is through use of anonymized data,
limiting the exposure of individual data to only where it is absolutely needed.
This would seem particularly appropriate for data mining, where the goal is
generalizable knowledge rather than data on specific individuals. In practice,
corporate data miners often insist on original data, for fear that they might
""miss something"" with anonymized or differentially private approaches. This
paper provides a theoretical justification for the use of anonymized data.
Specifically, we show that a support vector classifier trained on anatomized
data satisfying l-diversity should be expected to do as well as on the original
data. Anatomy preserves all data values, but introduces uncertainty in the
mapping between identifying and sensitive values, thus satisfying l-diversity.
The theoretical effectiveness of the proposed approach is validated using
several publicly available datasets, showing that we outperform the state of
the art for support vector classification using training data protected by
k-anonymity, and are comparable to learning on the original data.

the timed ancestral relationships of individuals sampled from a population of

sampling, which means that the intensity of sampling events is allowed to
depend on the effective population size trajectory. We assume the coalescent

genealogies. We include several coalescent simulation functions that are useful

quantified via higher-order mutual information and compared to the correlation
between pairs of variables in this model, and to the correlation in the
two-particle system. The results for the higher-order mutual information show
that there are states where the symmetric wave functions are more correlated

the correlation between pairs of variables in this model, and the two-particle

Ising feasibility, for which the network reliability is the Ising model s
partition function. As shown by Moore and Shannon, the network reliability can
be separated into two factors: structural, solely determined by the network
topology, and dynamical, determined by the underlying dynamics. In this case,
the structural factor is known as the joint density of states. Using methods
developed to approximate the structural factor for other reliability
properties, we simulate the joint density of states, yielding an approximation
for the partition function. Based on a detailed examination of why naive Monte
Carlo sampling gives a poor approximation, we introduce a novel parallel scheme
for estimating the joint density of states using a Markov chain Monte Carlo
method with a spin exchange random walk. This parallel scheme makes simulating
the Ising model in the presence of an external field practical on small

classical strings when the spatial dependence of the string world-sheet is
included. Sensitivity to initial conditions in chaotic systems suggests that
the string under chaos tends to stretch in the AdS soliton spacetime in a
Lyapunov timescale. In this process, the orbital angular momentum transfers to
internal spin due to the turbulence on the string. It follows that the string
stays around the tip of the AdS soliton with a jumbled profile. We evaluate the
spectra of conserved quantities and discuss their universal power-law scalings
in the turbulent behaviors.

solution to lensless imaging is a single pixel camera which benefits from ideas
central to compressive sampling. However, traditional single pixel cameras
require many illumination patterns which result in a long acquisition process.
Here we present a method for lensless imaging based on compressive ultrafast
sensing. Each sensor acquisition is encoded with a different illumination
pattern and produces a time series where time is a function of the photon's
origin in the scene. Currently available hardware with picosecond time
resolution enables time tagging photons as they arrive to an omnidirectional
sensor. This allows lensless imaging with significantly fewer patterns compared
to regular single pixel imaging. To that end, we develop a framework for
designing lensless imaging systems that use ultrafast detectors. We provide an
algorithm for ideal sensor placement and an algorithm for optimized active
illumination patterns. We show that efficient lensless imaging is possible with
ultrafast measurement and compressive sensing. This paves the way for novel
imaging architectures and remote sensing in extreme situations where imaging
with a lens is not possible.

Meanwhile, single-node CPU systems with caching performs well only for small
data sets; distributed systems have higher aggregated memory bandwidth but
suffer from relatively slow network connection. This observation inspires us to
accelerate MF by utilizing GPUs's high memory bandwidth and fast intra-node
connection. We present cuMF_SGD, a CUDA-based SGD solution for large-scale MF
problems. On a single CPU, we design two workload schedule schemes, i.e.,
batch-Hogwild! and wavefront-update that fully exploit the massive amount of

the issue of memory discontinuity. We also develop highly-optimized kernels for
SGD update, leveraging cache, warp-shuffle instructions and half-precision
floats. We also design a partition scheme to utilize multiple GPUs while
addressing the well-known convergence issue when parallelizing SGD. On three

paper primarily focuses on the properties and observability of the

generated in two-band superconductors by interband impurity scattering. We show
that such states can appear in two distinct ways. First, according to a
previously discussed scenario, the $s+is$ state can form as an intermediate
phase at the impurity-driven crossover between $s_{\pm}$ and $s_{++}$ states.
We show that there is a second scenario where domains of the $s+is$ state
exists in the form of an isolated dome inside the $s_{\pm}$ domain, completely
detached from the transition between $s_{\pm}$ and $s_{++}$ states. We
demonstrate that in both cases the $s+is$ state, generated by impurity
scattering exists in an extremely small interval of impurity concentrations.
Although this likely precludes direct experimental observation of the $s+is$
state formation due to this mechanism, this physics leads to the appearance of
a region inside both the $s_{\pm}$ and $s_{++}$ domains with unusual properties
due to softening of normal modes.

a main feature of our work is that the incident field is taken as a
superposition of two plane waves with different directions rather than one

the Lee-Wick sense. Therefore, it is important to explore also the IR limit of
these theories and identify observable signatures of the higher derivatives. In
the present work we study the scattering of a photon by a classical external
gravitational field in the sixth-derivative model whose propagator contains
only real, simple poles. Also, we discuss the possibility of a gravitational
seesaw-like mechanism, which could allow the make up of a relatively small
physical mass from the huge massive parameters of the action. If possible, this
mechanism would be a way out of the Planck suppression, affecting the
gravitational deflection of low energy photons. It turns out that the mechanism
which actually occurs works only to shift heavier masses to the further UV
region. This fact may be favourable for protecting the theory from
instabilities, but makes experimental detection of higher derivatives more
difficult.

translational and only rotational training trajectories, each of which can be

between the two motions. We validate our approach in experiments on a quadrotor

anomalous Hall effect of massive Dirac fermions has spurred the promise of
low-energy electronics. Some materials hosting Dirac fermions are natural
platforms for interlayer coherence effects such as Coulomb drag and exciton
condensation. Here we determine the role played by the anomalous Hall effect in
Coulomb drag in massive Dirac fermion systems. We focus on topological
insulator films with out-of plane magnetizations in both the active and passive
layers. The transverse response of the active layer is dominated by a
topological term arising from the Berry curvature. We show that the topological
mechanism does not contribute to Coulomb drag, yet the longitudinal drag force
in the passive layer gives rise to a transverse drag current. This anomalous
Hall drag current is independent of the active-layer magnetization, a fact that
can be verified experimentally. It depends non-monotonically on the
passive-layer magnetization, exhibiting a peak that becomes more pronounced at
low densities. These findings should stimulate new experiments and quantitative
studies of anomalous Hall drag.

domains are neither completely random nor fully regular, but instead appear to
contain recurring structural building blocks. These features tend to be shared
by networks belonging to the same broad class, such as the class of social
networks or the class of biological networks. At a finer scale of
classification within each such class, networks describing more similar systems
tend to have more similar features. This occurs presumably because networks
representing similar purposes or constructions would be expected to be
generated by a shared set of domain specific mechanisms, and it should
therefore be possible to classify these networks into categories based on their
features at various structural levels. Here we describe and demonstrate a new,
hybrid approach that combines manual selection of features of potential
interest with existing automated classification methods. In particular,
selecting well-known and well-studied features that have been used throughout
social network analysis and network science and then classifying with methods
such as random forests that are of special utility in the presence of feature
collinearity, we find that we achieve higher accuracy, in shorter computation
time, with greater interpretability of the network classification results.

of precision---is the centroiding of stars. Upcoming large surveys are going to
take images of billions of point sources, including many faint stars, with
short exposure times. Real-time estimation of the centroids of stars is crucial
for real-time PSF estimation, and maximal precision is required for
measurements of proper motion.
  The fundamental Cram\'{e}r-Rao lower bound sets a limit on the
root-mean-squared-error achievable by optimal estimators. In this work, we aim
to compare the performance of various centroiding methods, in terms of
saturating the bound, when they are applied to relatively low signal-to-noise
ratio unsaturated stars assuming zero-mean constant Gaussian noise. In order to
make this comparison, we present the ratio of the root-mean-squared-errors of
these estimators to their corresponding Cram\'{e}r-Rao bound as a function of
the signal-to-noise ratio and the full-width at half-maximum of faint stars.
  We discuss two general circumstances in centroiding of faint stars: (i) when
we have a good estimate of the PSF, (ii) when we do not know the PSF. In the
case that we know the PSF, we show that a fast polynomial centroiding after
smoothing the image by the PSF can be as efficient as the maximum-likelihood
estimator at saturating the bound. In the case that we do not know the PSF, we
demonstrate that although polynomial centroiding is not as optimal as PSF
profile fitting, it comes very close to saturating the Cram\'{e}r-Rao lower
bound in a wide range of conditions. We also show that the moment-based method
of center-of-light never comes close to saturating the bound, and thus it does
not deliver reliable estimates of centroids.

within the formalism of multiple reflection expansion (MRE). Quark matter is
described as a mixture of free Fermi gases composed by quarks $u$, $d$, $s$ and
electrons, in chemical equilibrium under weak interactions. Due to the presence
of strong magnetic fields the particles' transverse motion is quantized into
Landau levels, and the surface tension has a different value in the parallel
and transverse directions with respect to the magnetic field.
  We calculate the transverse and longitudinal surface tension for different
values of the magnetic field and for quark matter drops with different sizes,
from a few fm to the bulk limit. For baryon number densities between $2-10$
times the nuclear saturation density, the surface tension falls in the range $2
- 20$ MeV /fm$^{2}$. The largest contribution comes from strange quarks which
have a surface tension an order of magnitude larger than the one for $u$ or $d$
quarks and more than two orders of magnitude larger than for electrons. Our
results show that the total surface tension is quite insensitive to the size of
the drop. We also find that the surface tensions in the transverse and parallel
directions are almost unaffected by the magnetic field if $eB$ is below $\sim 5
\times 10^{-3} $ GeV$^2$. Nevertheless, for higher values of $eB$, there is a
significant increase in the parallel surface tension and a significant decrease
in the transverse one with respect to the unmagnetized case.

accounts for a large part of the total QCD correction, especially in the high

$p_{{\rm \,T,jet}} > p_{{\rm \,T,jet}}^{{\rm \,\,\,cut}}=50~{\rm GeV}$, the jet

remove it in each iteration. However, such a solution is impractical due to
high processing cost. The problem is further complicated when dealing with
dynamic graphs, since adding or removing an edge requires re-running the
algorithm. In this paper, we study the top-$k$ densest-subgraph problem in the

input of our algorithm consists of an edge stream, and the goal is to find the
node-disjoint subgraphs that maximize the sum of their densities. In contrast
to existing state-of-the-art solutions that require iterating over the entire
graph upon any update, our algorithm profits from the observation that updates
only affect a limited region of the graph. Therefore, the top-$k$ densest
subgraphs are maintained by only applying local updates. We provide a
theoretical analysis of the proposed algorithm and show empirically that the
algorithm often generates denser subgraphs than state-of-the-art competitors.

physics of stellar atmospheres as well as for ongoing radial velocity exoplanet
programmes. Despite the increasing interest in M dwarfs, our knowledge of the
chromospheres of these stars is far from being complete. We aim to test whether
the relations between activity, rotation, and stellar parameters and flux-flux
relationships also hold for early-M dwarfs on the main-sequence. We analyse in
an homogeneous and coherent way a well defined sample of 71 late-K/early-M
dwarfs that are currently being observed in the framework of the HArps-n red
Dwarf Exoplanet Survey (HADES). Rotational velocities are derived using the
cross-correlation technique while emission flux excesses in the Ca II H & K and
Balmer lines from Halpha up to Hepsilon are obtained by using the spectral
subtraction technique. The relationships between the emission excesses and the
stellar parameters are studied. Relations between pairs of fluxes of different
chromospheric lines are also studied. We find that the strength of the
chromospheric emission in the Ca II H & K and Balmer lines is roughly constant
for stars in the M0-M3 spectral range. Our data suggest that a moderate but
significant correlation between activity and rotation might be present as well
as a hint of kinematically selected young stars showing higher levels of
emission. We find our sample of M dwarfs to be complementary in terms of
chromospheric and X-ray fluxes with those of the literature, extending the
analysis of the flux-flux relationships to the very low flux domain. Our
results agree with previous works suggesting that the activity-rotation-age
relationship known to hold for solar-type stars also applies to early-M dwarfs.
We also confirm previous findings that the field stars which deviate from the
bulk of the empirical flux-flux relationships show evidence of youth.

investigate the existence/non existence of travelling waves, and the
propagation properties of the Cauchy problem.When the dispersion kernel $J$ is
exponentially bounded, travelling waves are known to exist and solutions of the
Cauchy problem typically propagate at a constant speed \cite{Schumacher1980},
\cite{Weinberger1982}, \cite{Carr2004}, \cite{Coville2007a},
\cite{Coville2008a}, \cite{Yagisita2009}. %When the dispersion kernel $J$ is
exponentially bounded, travelling waves are known to exist when $f$ belongs to
one of the three main class of non-linearities (bistable, ignition or
monostable), and solutions of the Cauchy problem typically propagate at a
constant speed \cite{Schumacher1980},
\cite{Wei-82},\cite{Bates1997},\cite{Chen1997}, \cite{Carr2004},
\cite{Coville2007a}, \cite{Coville2008a}, \cite{Yagisita2009,Yagisita2009a}. On
the other hand, when the dispersion kernel $J$ has heavy tails and the
non-linearity $f$ is non degenerate, i.e $f'(0)\textgreater{}0$, travelling
waves do not exist and solutions of the Cauchy problem propagate by
accelerating \cite{Medlock2003}, \cite{Yagisita2009}, \cite{Garnier2011}. For a
general monostable non-linearity, a dichotomy between these two types of
propagation behaviour is still not known. The originality of our work is to
provide such dichotomy by studying the interplay between the tails of the
dispersion kernel and the Allee effect induced by the degeneracy of $f$, i.e.
$f'(0)=0$. First, for algebraic decaying kernels, we prove the exact separation
between existence and non existence of travelling waves. This in turn provides
the exact separation between non acceleration and acceleration in the Cauchy
problem. In the latter case, we provide a first estimate of the position of the
level sets of the solution.

means of controlled experiments. The influence of the pedestrians' behaviours
is investigated by prescribing a selfish attitude to a fraction c\_s of the
participants, while the others behave politely. Thanks to an original setup
enabling the re-injection of egressed participants into the room, the analysis
is conducted in a (macroscopically) quasi-stationary regime. We find that, as
c\_s is increased, the flow rate J rises, interpolating between published
values for egresses in normal conditions and measurements for competitive
evacuations. The dependence of several flow properties on the pedestrian
density $\rho$ at the door, independently of c\_s , suggests that
macroscopically the behavioural aspects could be subsumed under the density, at
least in our specific settings with limited crowd pressure. In particular,
under these conditions, J grows monotonically with $\rho$ up to ""close-packing""
($\rho$ $\approx$ 9 pers/m${}^2$). The flow is then characterised
microscopically. Among other quantities, the time lapses between successive
escapes, the pedestrians' waiting times in front of the door, and their angles
of incidence are analysed statistically. In a nutshell, our main results show
that the flow is orderly for polite crowds, with narrowly distributed time
lapses between egresses, while for larger c\_s the flow gets disorderly and
vanishing time lapses emerge. For all c\_s , we find an alternation between
short and long time lapses, which we ascribe to a generalised zipper effect.
The average waiting time in the exit zone increases with its occupancy. The
disorder in the flow and the pressure felt by participants are also assessed.

formation and black hole accretion, gauged on a wealth of multiwavelength
observations including the observed Eddington ratio distribution. We further
validate these ingredients by showing their consistency with the observed
galaxy stellar mass functions and AGN bolometric luminosity functions at
different redshifts via the continuity equation approach. Our analysis of the
main sequence for high-redshift galaxies and AGNs highlights that the present

hadronic final state consisting of $bb\bar{b}+\mbox{jets}+X$. Dictated by the

two scenarios in which the charged Higgs mass is 750 GeV and the pseudoscalar
Higgs mass is 200 GeV and 500 GeV. In this mass scheme highly boosted final
state objects are expected and handled with jet substructure techniques which
also acts to suppress the standard model background. A detailed detector

clouds. The most probable cloud size is $R\sim30$ pc. We find that $M\propto
R^{2.2\pm0.2}$, with no correlation between the cloud surface density,
$\Sigma$, and $R$. In contrast with the general idea, we find a rather large
range of values of $\Sigma$, from 2 to $300 M_\odot$ pc$^{-2}$, and a
systematic decrease with increasing Galactic radius, $R_{\rm gal}$. The cloud
velocity dispersion and the normalization $\sigma_0=\sigma_v/R^{1/2}$ both
decrease systematically with $R_{\rm gal}$. When studied over the whole

a significantly better correlation between $\sigma_v$ and $\Sigma\,R$. The
normalization of this correlation is constant to better than a factor of two

between near and far kinematic distances. We report a strong variation of the
turbulent energy injection rate. In the outer Galaxy it may be maintained by
accretion through the disk and/or onto the clouds, but neither source can drive

The HARPS-N spectra provide simultaneously the H&K doublet and the H{\alpha}

instrumental and atmospheric effects, and to provide flux-calibrated spectra in
units of flux at the stellar surface. The H&K and H{\alpha} fluxes are compared
with each other, and their variability is analyzed. We find that the H and K
flux excesses are strongly correlated with each other, while the H{\alpha} flux
excess is generally less correlated with the H&K doublet. We also find that
H{\alpha} emission does not increase monotonically with the H&K line flux,
showing some absorption before being filled in by chromospheric emission when
H&K activity increases. Analyzing the time variability of the emission fluxes,
we derive a tentative estimate of the rotation period (of the order of a few
tens of days) for some of the program stars, and the typical lifetime of
chromospheric active regions (a few stellar rotations). Our results are in good
agreement with previous studies. In particular, we find evidence that the
chromospheres of early-type M dwarfs could be characterized by different
filaments coverage, affecting the formation mechanism of the H{\alpha} line. We
also show that chromospheric structure is likely related to spectral type.

trivial categorification, using an appropriate functor $\mathbf{F}: \mathbf{C}
\xrightarrow{F} \mathbf{D} \xrightarrow{I} \mathbf{Cat}$ to construct
$\int_{\mathbf{C}^{op}} \bar{\mathbf{F}}$. This category characterizes a

trivial categories. The perspective of making only base structure explicit
through category theory concealing the vertical structure using identity
morphisms enables one to combine intuitions of Grothendieck's relative and
Leyton's generative theory. As explored further, it facilitates the application
of functors in certain fundamental applications which hitherto have been

to the enhanced desorption of particles to the interface and a mathematical
framework has been derived to quantify this. Combined particle and surfactant
effect on surface tension of complex nanofluid system showed a decreasing
behaviour with respect to the particle and surfactant concentration with a
considerably feeble effect of particle concentration. This combined colloidal

as water absorption bands, is a required preprocessing step. Currently, the
commonly applied method is by visual inspection, which is very time-consuming
and it is easy to overlook some noisy bands. In this study, we find an inherent
connection between target detection algorithms and the corrupted band removal.
As an example, for the matched filter (MF), which is the most widely used
target detection method for hyperspectral data, we present an automatic
MF-based algorithm for bad band identification. The MF detector is a filter
vector, and the resulting filter output is the sum of all bands weighted by the
MF coefficients. Therefore, we can identify bad bands only by using the MF
filter vector itself, the absolute value of whose entry accounts for the
importance of each band for the target detection. For a specific target of
interest, the bands with small MF weights correspond to the noisy or bad ones.
Based on this fact, we develop an automatic bad band preremoval algorithm by
utilizing the average absolute value of MF weights for multiple targets within
a scene. Experiments with three well known hyperspectral datasets show that our
method can always identify the water absorption and other low signal-to-noise
(SNR) bands that are usually chosen as bad bands manually.

implosion in the form of an arcade contraction associated with a filament
eruption, during the C3.5 flare SOL2013-06-19T07:29. A sequence of events
including magnetic flux-rope instability and distortion, followed by filament
eruption and arcade implosion, lead us to conclude that the implosion arises
from the transfer of magnetic energy from beneath the arcade as part of the
global magnetic instability, rather than due to local magnetic energy
dissipation in the flare. The observed net contraction of the imploding loops,
which is found also in nonlinear force-free field extrapolations, reflects a
permanent reduction of magnetic energy underneath the arcade. This event shows
that, in addition to resulting in expansion or eruption of overlying field,
flux-rope instability can also simultaneously implode unopened field due to
magnetic energy transfer. It demonstrates the ""partial opening of the field""
scenario, which is one of the ways in 3D to produce a magnetic eruption without
violating the Aly-Sturrock hypothesis. In the framework of this observation we
also propose a unification of three main concepts for active region magnetic
evolution, namely the metastable eruption model, the implosion conjecture, and
the standard ""CSHKP"" flare model.

substantial gender differences in scientific collaborations. While men are more
likely to collaborate with other men, women are more egalitarian. This is
consistently observed over all fields and regardless of the number of
collaborators a scientist has. The only exception is observed in the field of
engineering, where this gender bias disappears with increasing number of
collaborators. We also found that the distribution of the number of
collaborators follows a truncated power law with a cut-off that is gender
dependent and related to the gender differences in the number of published
papers. Considering interdisciplinary research, our analysis shows that men and
women behave similarly across fields, except in the case of natural sciences,
where women with many collaborators are more likely to have collaborators from

Previous works concentrate on crafting and extracting various features from
malware binaries, disassembled binaries or API calls via static or dynamic
analysis and resorting to ML to build classifiers. However, they tend to
involve too much feature engineering and fail to provide interpretability. We
solve these two problems with the recent advances in deep learning: 1)
RNN-based autoencoders (RNN-AEs) can automatically learn low-dimensional
representation of a malware from its raw API call sequence. 2) Multiple
decoders can be trained under different supervisions to give more information,
other than the class or family label of a malware. Inspired by the works of
document classification and automatic sentence summarization, each API call
sequence can be regarded as a sentence. In this paper, we make the first
attempt to build a multi-task malware learning model based on API call
sequences. The model consists of two decoders, one for malware classification
and one for $\emph{file access pattern}$ (FAP) generation given the API call
sequence of a malware. We base our model on the general seq2seq framework.
Experiments show that our model can give competitive classification results as
well as insightful FAP information.

effect. At low redshift this Doppler magnification completely dominates the
usual integrated gravitational lensing contribution to the lensing
magnification. We show that one can optimally observe this pattern by
extracting the dipole in the cross-correlation of number counts and galaxy
sizes. This dipole allows us to almost completely remove the contribution from
gravitational lensing up to redshift 0.5, and even at high redshift z~1 the
dipole picks up the Doppler magnification predominantly. Doppler magnification
should be easily detectable in current and upcoming optical and radio surveys;
by forecasting for telescopes such as the SKA, we show that this technique is

has also investigated different methods like minimization of Mean Square Error
(MSE) and Mean Absolute Error (MAE) for the estimation of VTLN parameters. Both

consequence of our methods, we find a class of degeneracy weights $w$ for which
$L^2$-estimates for these conical square functions hold. This opens the door to
the study of weighted and unweighted Hardy spaces and of boundary value

resolution for both finite difference and quadrature schemes. For soft EOS
(i.e. polytropic index $n \ge 1$), the underlying $2$nd-order is naturally
recovered for Boundary Values (BVs) and any other integrated quantity sensitive
to the mass density (mass, angular momentum, volume, Virial Parameter, etc.),
i.e. errors vary with the number $N$ of nodes per direction as $\sim 1/N^2$.
This is, however, not observed for purely geometrical quantities (surface area,
meridional section area, volume), unless a subgrid approach is considered (i.e.
boundary detection). Equilibrium sequences are also much better described,
especially close to critical rotation. Yet another technical effort is required
for hard EOS ($n < 1$), due to infinite mass density gradients at the fluid
surface. We fix the problem by using kernel splitting. Finally, we propose an
accelerated version of the SCF-algorithm based on a node-by-node
pre-conditionning of the mass density at each step. The computing time is
reduced by a factor $2$ typically, regardless of the polytropic index. There is
a priori no obstacle to applying these results and techniques to ellipsoidal

We say that a lambda-letrec term expresses a lambda-term if the latter can be
obtained as an infinite unfolding of the former. Unfolding is the process of
substituting occurrences of function variables by the right-hand side of their
definition.
  We consider the following questions: (i) How can we characterise those
infinite {\lambda}-terms that are {\lambda}-letrec-expressible? (ii) Given two
{\lambda}-letrec terms, how can we determine whether they have the same
unfolding? (iii) Given a {\lambda}-letrec term, can we find a more compact
version of the term with the same unfolding? To tackle these questions we
introduce and study the following formalisms: (i) a rewriting system for
unfolding {\lambda}-letrec terms into {\lambda}-terms (ii) a rewriting system
for `observing' {\lambda}-terms by dissecting their term structure (iii)
higher-order and first-order graph formalisms together with translations
between them as well as translations from and to {\lambda}-letrec.
  We identify a first-order term graph formalism on which bisimulation
preserves and reflects the unfolding semantics of {\lambda}-letrec and which is
closed under functional bisimulation. From this we derive efficient methods to
determine whether two terms are equivalent under infinite unfolding and to
compute the maximally shared form of a given {\lambda}-letrec term.

use to analyze the data to be clustered. Inappropriate scale usually leads to
unreasonable cluster centers and thus unreasonable results. In this study, we
first consider the similarity of elements in the data as the connectivity of
nodes in an undirected graph, then present the concept of a connection center
and regard it as the cluster center of the data. Based on this definition, the
determination of cluster centers and the assignment of class are very simple,
natural and effective. One more crucial finding is that the cluster centers of
different scales can be obtained easily by the different powers of a similarity
matrix and the change of power from small to large leads to the dynamic
evolution of cluster centers from local (microscopic) to global (microscopic).

analyze the excitation of slow electrostatic fluctuations (with phase speed
close to the electron thermal speed), due to a beam-plasma interaction, and
their propagation in linear and nonlinear regime. In 1968, O'Neil and Malmberg
[Phys. Fluids {\bf 11}, 1754 (1968)] dubbed these waves ""beam modes"". In the
present paper, it is shown that, in the presence of a cold and low density
electron beam, these beam modes can become unstable and then survive Landau
damping unlike the Langmuir waves. When an electron beam is launched in a
plasma of Maxwellian electrons and motionless protons and this initial
equilibrium is perturbed by a monochromatic density disturbance, the electric
field amplitude grows exponentially in time and then undergoes nonlinear
saturation, associated with the kinetic effects of particle trapping and phase
space vortex generation. Moreover, if the initial density perturbation is setup
in the form of a low amplitude random phase noise, once the most unstable mode
has reached its nonlinear saturation amplitude after the linear growth, the
whole Fourier spectrum of wavenumbers is excited. As a result, the electric
field profile appears as a train of isolated pulses, each of them being
associated with a phase space vortex in the electron distribution function. At
later times, these vortical structures tend to merge and, correspondingly, the
electric pulses collapse, showing the tendency towards a time asymptotic
configuration with a single phase space structure associated to an electric
soliton-like pulse. This dynamical evolution is driven by purely kinetic
processes, possibly at work in many space and laboratory plasma environments.

wall-bounded turbulence. This scenario introduces a new field of transverse
waves. Significance of the theory rests on a mathematical theorem associated
with the conservation law of current flux, expressed in a form of 4d physical
space-time representation, which predicts a system of Maxwell-type equation and
supports transverse waves traveling with a phase speed c_t. In regard to the
streaky wall flows, there exist both dynamical mechanism and energy channel
which excite transverse waves and exchange energy between flow field and wave
field. Energy is supplied from the flow field to the wave field if wavelengths
are sufficiently large. The waves are accompanied with a new mechanism of
energy dissipation, an internal friction analogous to the Ohm's effect. Some
part of the energy is dissipated into heat. Thus, there exists a sustaining
mechanism, which implies that the streaky structure of wall-bounded turbulence
is a dissipative structure.
  The predictions are consistent with experimental observations of wall
turbulence: (i) Existence of traveling waves: The waves are characterized by
two scales of wavelength and a damping-length d. (ii) Existence of two large
scales (LSM and VLSM) observed in turbulent shear flows: Those are interpreted
by the waves amplified with the transient growth mechanism and maintained by
interaction with the new transverse wave field. The waves are robust since they
have their own energy and momentum. (iii) Enhanced energy dissipation in wavy
turbulence. Its bulk rate of energy dissipation takes a form resembling the
models of eddy-viscosity, and its coefficient \nu_D is estimated to be of the
order of c_t d and much larger than the molecular viscosity.
  No self-contradiction is incurred by the new field introduced.

or its lower limit for 19 objects. In addition to our data, we compile this
flux ratio (or its lower limit) of 23 nearby Seyfert galaxies from the
literature. Based on the collected data, we find that three Seyfert galaxies
show very large lower limits of [Fe II]/[P II] flux ratios ($\gtrsim$10); NGC
2782, 5005, and Mrk 463. It is thus suggested that the contribution of the fast
shock in the gas excitation is significantly large for them. However, more than
half of Seyfert galaxies in our sample show moderate [Fe II]/[P II] flux ratios
($\sim$2), that is consistent to the pure photoionization by power-law ionizing
continuum emission. We also find that the [Fe II]/[P II] flux ratio shows no
clear correlation with the radio loudness, suggesting that the radio jet is not
the primary origin of shocks in NLRs of Seyfert galaxies.

implemented a platform for complete start-to-end simulations, following the
radiation from the source, through the beam transport optics to the sample or

initially move their eyes towards the center of the image --- a reliable
experimental finding termed central fixation bias. This systematic tendency in
eye guidance likely masks attentional selection driven by image properties and
top-down cognitive processes. Here we show that the central fixation bias can
be reduced by delaying the initial saccade relative to image onset. In four
scene-viewing experiments we manipulated observers' initial gaze position and
delayed their first saccade by a specific time interval relative to the onset
of an image. We analyzed the distance to image center over time and show that
the central fixation bias of initial fixations was significantly reduced after
delayed saccade onsets. We additionally show that selection of the initial
saccade target strongly depended on the first saccade latency. Processes
influencing the time course of the central fixation bias were investigated by
comparing simulations of several dynamic and statistical models. Model
comparisons suggest that the central fixation bias is generated by a default
activation as a response to the sudden image onset and that this default
activation pattern decreases over time. Our results suggest that it may often
be preferable to use a modified version of the scene viewing paradigm that
decouples image onset from the start signal for scene exploration and
explicitly controls the central fixation bias. In general, the initial fixation
location and the latency of the first saccade need to be taken into
consideration when investigating eye movements during scene viewing.

optimal control strategy. Both requirements for automatic training processes
are not found in most real-world reinforcement learning (RL) problems. In such
applications, online learning is often prohibited for safety reasons because
online learning requires exploration of the problem's dynamics during policy
training. We introduce a fuzzy particle swarm reinforcement learning (FPSRL)
approach that can construct fuzzy RL policies solely by training parameters on
world models that simulate real system dynamics. These world models are created
by employing an autonomous machine learning technique that uses previously
generated transition samples of a real system. To the best of our knowledge,
this approach is the first to relate self-organizing fuzzy controllers to
model-based batch RL. Therefore, FPSRL is intended to solve problems in domains
where online learning is prohibited, system dynamics are relatively easy to
model from previously generated default policy transition samples, and it is
expected that a relatively easily interpretable control policy exists. The
efficiency of the proposed approach with problems from such domains is
demonstrated using three standard RL benchmarks, i.e., mountain car, cart-pole
balancing, and cart-pole swing-up. Our experimental results demonstrate
high-performing, interpretable fuzzy policies.

focusing in particular on the determination of the slope of the dark matter

can be broken when we can isolate separate components of each lensed image, as
in this case. For an elliptical power law model, $\kappa(r) \sim r^{-t}$, the
results favour a flatter-than-isothermal slope with a maximum-likelihood value
t = 0.08. Instead, when we consider the contribution of the baryonic matter
separately, the maximum-likelihood value of the slope of the dark matter

applications in several fields. Algorithms for identifying dense subgraphs are
used in biology, in finance, in spam detection, etc. Standard formulations of
this problem such as the problem of finding the maximum clique of a graph are
hard to solve. However, some tractable formulations of the problem have also
been proposed, focusing mainly on optimizing some density function, such as the
degree density and the triangle density. However, maximization of degree
density usually leads to large subgraphs with small density. In this paper, we
introduce the k-clique-graph densest subgraph problem, k >= 3, a novel
formulation for the discovery of dense subgraphs. Given an input graph, its
k-clique-graph is a new graph created from the input graph where each vertex of
the new graph corresponds to a k-clique of the input graph and two vertices are
connected with an edge if they share a common (k-1)-clique. We define a simple
density function, the k-clique-graph density, which gives compact and at the
same time dense subgraphs, and we project its resulting subgraphs back to the
input graph. In this paper we focus on the triangle-graph densest subgraph
problem obtained for k=3. To optimize the proposed function, we present an
efficient greedy approximation algorithm that scales well to larger graphs. We
evaluate the proposed algorithm on real datasets and compare it with other
algorithms in terms of the size and the density of the extracted subgraphs. The
results verify the ability of the proposed algorithm in finding high-quality
subgraphs in terms of size and density. Finally, we apply the proposed method
to the important problem of keyword extraction from textual documents.

stellarators is non-zero due to the three-dimensional nature of the magnetic
field. Stellarators in which the orbit-averaged radial magnetic drift vanishes
are called omnigeneous, and they exhibit neoclassical transport levels
comparable to those of axisymmetric tokamaks. However, the effect of deviations
from omnigeneity cannot be neglected in practice. For sufficiently low
collision frequencies (below the values that define the $1/\nu$ regime), the
components of the drifts tangential to the flux surface become relevant. This
article focuses on the study of such collisionality regimes in stellarators
close to omnigeneity when the gradient of the non-omnigeneous perturbation is
small. First, it is proven that closeness to omnigeneity is required to
preserve radial locality in the drift-kinetic equation for collisionalities
below the $1/\nu$ regime. Then, it is shown that neoclassical transport is
determined by two layers in phase space. One of the layers corresponds to the
$\sqrt{\nu}$ regime and the other to the superbanana-plateau regime. The
importance of the superbanana-plateau layer for the calculation of the
tangential electric field is emphasized, as well as the relevance of the latter
for neoclassical transport in the collisionality regimes considered in this
paper. In particular, the tangential electric field is essential for the
emergence of a new subregime of superbanana-plateau transport when the radial
electric field is small. A formula for the ion energy flux that includes the
$\sqrt{\nu}$ regime and the superbanana-plateau regime is given. The energy
flux scales with the square of the size of the deviation from omnigeneity.
Finally, it is explained why below a certain collisionality value the
formulation presented in this article ceases to be valid.

classic signature matching based on byte patterns is still a prevalent concept
for identifying security threats. Anti-virus signatures are a simple and fast
detection mechanism that can complement more sophisticated analysis strategies.
However, if signatures are not designed with care, they can turn from a
defensive mechanism into an instrument of attack. In this paper, we present a
novel method for automatically deriving signatures from anti-virus software and
demonstrate how the extracted signatures can be used to attack sensible data
with the aid of the virus scanner itself. We study the practicability of our
approach using four commercial products and exemplarily discuss a novel attack
vector made possible by insufficiently designed signatures. Our research
indicates that there is an urgent need to improve pattern-based signatures if
used in anti-virus software and to pursue alternative detection approaches in
such products.

  binary trees","5 pages, 8 figures",,,,"cs.DS","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Tree rotations (left and right) are basic local deformations allowing to
transform between two unlabeled binary trees of the same size. Hence, there is
a natural problem of practically finding such transformation path with low
number of rotations, the optimal minimal number is called the rotation
distance. Such distance could be used for instance to quantify similarity
between two trees for various machine learning problems, for example to compare
hierarchical clusterings or arbitrarily chosen spanning trees of two graphs,
like in SMILES notation popular for describing chemical molecules.
  There will be presented inexpensive practical greedy algorithm for finding a
short rotation path, optimality of which has still to be determined. It uses
introduced partial order for binary trees of the same size: $t_1 \leq t_2$ iff
$t_2$ can be obtained from $t_1$ by a sequence of only right rotations.
Intuitively, the shortest rotation path should go through the least upper bound
or the greatest lower bound for this partial order. The algorithm finds a path
through candidates for both points in representation of binary tree as stack
graph: describing evolution of content of stack while processing a formula
described by a given binary tree. The article is accompanied with Mathematica
implementation of all used procedures (Appendix).

to overcome the flavor problem in SSMs, supersymmetric stand models (SM).
However, implemented in the minimal SSM (MSSM), a very serious fine-tuning
problem arises, owing to the absence of a large $A_t$ term in the stop sector
to radiatively enhance the SM-like Higgs boson mass. In the extended GMSB
coupling $H_u$ to messengers can alleviate this problem but encounters the
$A_t/m_{H_u}^2$ problem, i.e., at the same time a large $m_{H_u}^2$ is
generated, rendering radiative electroweak spontaneously breaking (EWSB)
problematic. This issue shows similarity to another long-standing problem of
GMSB, the $\mu/{B_\mu }$ problem, and, of great interest, we find that they may
admit the same solution, nonradiative EWSB. Such a solution is naturally
accommodated when both $H_u$ and $H_d$ couple to messengers. As a bonus of
nonradiative EWSB, the sleptons tend to be very light due to the significant
renormalization group equation effect and they are able to account for the
$(g-2)_\mu$ puzzle. As a concrete example, we investigate a hidden sector with
$(10,\overline {10})$ messengers.

actuating forces and forces derived from a direct interaction potential, as
well as hydrodynamic forces exerted by the fluid as frictional and added mass
hydrodynamic interactions. The swimming velocity is deduced from the momentum
balance equation for the assembly of spheres, and the mean power required
during a period is calculated from an instantaneous power equation. Expressions
are derived for the mean swimming velocity and the mean power, valid to second
order in the amplitude of displacements from the relative equilibrium

the optcal scalars allow to deal with more general matter content including
sources with non Newtonian components of the energy-momentum tensor and
arbitrary motion.
  Our treatment is within the framework of weak gravitational lenses in which
first order effects of the curvature are considered. We have been able to make
all calculations without referring to the concept of deviation angle. This in
turn, makes the presentation shorter but also allows for the consideration of
global effects on the Robertson-Walker background that have been neglected in
the literature.
  We also discuss two intensity magnification, that we define in this article;
one coming from a natural geometrical contruction in terms of the affine
distance, that here we call $\tilde{\mu}$, and the other adapted to
cosmological discussions in terms of the redshift, that we call $\mu'$. We show
that the natural intensity magnification $\tilde{\mu}$ coincides with the

germination response of six Acacia species under different NaCl concentrations
in order to explore opportunities for selection and breeding salt tolerant
genotypes. Methodology: Germination of seeds was evaluated under salt stresses
using 5 treatment levels: 0, 100, 200, 300 and 400 mM of NaCl. Corrected
germination rate (GC), germination rate index (GRI) and mean germination time
(MGT) were recorded during 10 days. Results: The results indicated that
germination was significantly reduced in all species with the increase in NaCl
concentrations. However, significant interspecific variation for salt tolerance
was observed. The greatest variability in tolerance was observed at moderate
salt stress (200 mM of NaCl) and the decrease in germination appeared to be
more accentuated in A. cyanophylla and A. cyclops. Although, A. raddiana,
remains the most interesting, it preserved the highest percentage (GC = 80%)
and velocity of germination in all species studied in this study, even in the
high salt levels. This species exhibited a particular adaptability to salt
environment, at least at this stage in the life cycle and could be recommended
for plantation establishment in salt affected areas. On the other hand, when
ungerminated seeds were transferred from NaCl treatments to distilled water,
they recovered largely their germination without a lag period and with high
speed. This indicated that the germination inhibition was related to a
reversible osmotic stress that induced dormancy rather than specific ion
toxicity. Conclusion: This ability to germinate after exposure to higher
concentrations of NaCl suggests that studied species, especially the most
tolerant could be able to germinate under the salt affected soils and could be
utilized for the rehabilitation of damaged arid zones.

The calculated band structure of the three compounds, namely HfRhBi, ZrIrBi and

confidence on the theoretical predictions of these unreported systems, we first
checked our calculated results for a well studied similar compound, ZrNiSn, and
showed reasonable agreement with the measured ones. HfRhBi and ZrIrBi turn out
to be narrow band gap while ZrRhBi is a moderate band gap semiconductor. A
detailed study of the carrier concentration and temperature dependance of the

ultra-fast, large-bandwidth pulses may speed up the ionization process with

hydrogen-like atoms (the P\""oschl-Teller potential), that allows to tune the

Our condition is based on the notion of biased graphs known from matroid

where $\mathcal{B}$ is a class of balanced cycles in $G$, the problem of
finding a set $X$ of at most $k$ vertices in $G$ which intersects every
unbalanced cycle in $G$ admits an FPT algorithm using an LP-branching approach,
similar to those previously seen for VCSP problems (Wahlstr\""om, SODA 2014).
This framework captures many of the problems previously solved via the VCSP
approach to LP-branching, as well as new generalisations, such as Group
Feedback Vertex Set for infinite groups (e.g., for graphs whose edges are
labelled by matrices). A major advantage compared to previous work is that it
is immediate to check the applicability of the result for a given problem,
whereas testing applicability of the VCSP approach for a specific VCSP requires
determining the existence of an embedding language with certain algebraically
defined properties, which is not known to be decidable in general.
Additionally, we study the approximation question, and show that every problem
of this category admits an $O(\log \text{OPT})$-approximation.

for Bi single crystals under pressures up to 10.5GPa. The temperature dependent
resistivity shows a semimetallic behavior at ambient and low pressures (below
about 1.6GPa). This is followed by an upturn of resistivity in low temperature
region when the pressure is increased, which is explained as a semiconductor
behavior. This feature gradually gets enhanced up to a pressure of about
2.52GPa. Then a non-monotonic temperature dependent resistivity appears upon
further increasing pressure, which is accompanied by a strong suppression to
the low temperature resistivity upturn. Simultaneously, a superconducting
transition occurs at about 3.92K under a pressure of about 2.63GPa. With
further increasing pressure, a second superconducting transition emerges at
about 7K under about 2.8GPa. For these two superconducting states, the
superconductivity induced magnetic screening volumes are quite large. As the
pressure further increased to 8.1GPa, we observe the third superconducting
transition at about 8.2K. The resistivity measurements under magnetic field
allow us to determine the upper critical fields $\mu_0 H_{c2}$ of the
superconducting phases. The upper critical field for the phase with $T_c=3.92$K
is extremely low. Based on the Werthamer-Helfand-Hohenberg (WHH) theory, the
estimated value of $\mu_0 H_{c2}$ for this phase is about 0.103T. While the
upper critical field for the phase with $T_c$=7K is very high with a value of
about 4.56T. Finally, we present a pressure dependent phase diagram of Bi

between solar wind proton temperature (Tp) and speed (Vp) and between the

Earth. We find a long-term decrease in the proton temperature-speed (Tp-Vp)
slope that lasted from 1972 to 2010, but has been trending upward since 2010.
Since the solar wind proton density-speed (np-Vp) relationship is not linear
like the Tp-Vp relationship, we perform power law fits for np-Vp. The exponent
(steepness in the np-Vp relationship) is correlated with the solar cycle. This
exponent has a stronger correlation with current sheet tilt angle than with
sunspot number because the sunspot number maxima vary considerably from cycle
to cycle and the tilt angle maxima do not. To understand this finding, we
examined the average np for different speed ranges, and found that for the slow
wind np is highly correlated with the sunspot number with a lag of ~4 years.
The fast wind np variation was less, but in phase with the cycle. This phase
difference may contribute to the np-Vp exponent correlation with the solar
cycle. These long-term trends are important since empirical formulas based on
fits to Tp and Vp data are commonly used to identify ICMEs, but these formulas
do not include any time dependence. Changes in the solar wind density over a
solar cycle will create corresponding changes in the near Earth space
environment and the overall extent of the heliosphere.

macro-object using a simple perturbation method. We study the model Hamiltonian
involving the weak interaction between the center of mass and its environment.
  The main conclusion is that the pointer states emerge as the small part of
the total state vector when the interaction Hamiltonian is not dominant: the
degrees of freedom being at the center of interaction can be localized. In the
weak interaction case, if the disappearance of the energy contribution from the
off-diagonal terms is caused by the decoherence, it threatens the conservation
law. In this study, however, the energy conservation reasonably holds, since
the non-classical (i.e., normal quantum) states give main contribution to it.
  The emergence of the pointer states also implies the special initial state in
which the localized state makes the deep well of the potential. In the result,
the unitary time evolution of a pointer state is very different from that of
the majority of the original state vector of the total system.

algorithms named MP-BPF and MZ-BPF to reconstruct ROI images from truncated
PTCT data. A weight function is constructed to deal with data redundancy for
multi-linear translations modes. Extensive numerical simulations are performed
to evaluate the proposed MP-BPF and MZ-BPF algorithms for PTCT in fan-beam
geometry. Qualitative and quantitative results demonstrate that the proposed
BPF-type algorithms can not only accurately reconstruct ROI images from
truncated projections but also provide high-quality images for the entire image
support in some circumstances.

volumetric flow penetration within the porous electrode beneath the flow

concentrations exceeding a given critical level enables researchers to study
the health impact of road traffic on local air quality and to inform public
policy action. Precise estimates of the probabilities of occurrence and level
of extreme concentrations are formidable due to the combination of complex
physical and chemical processes involved. This underpins the need for
developing sophisticated extreme value models, in particular allowing for
non-stationarity of environmental time series. In this paper, extremes of
nitrogen oxide (NO), nitrogen dioxide (NO$_2$) and ozone (O$_3$) concentrations
are investigated using two models. Model I is based on an extended
peaks-over-threshold (POT) approach developed by A. C. Davison and R. L. Smith,
whereby the parameters of the underlying generalized Pareto distribution (GPD)
are treated as functions of covariates (i.e., traffic and meteorological
factors). The new Model II resolves the lack of threshold stability in the
Davison--Smith model by constructing a special functional form for the GPD
parameters. For each of the models, the effects of trafic and meteorological
factors on the frequency and size of extreme values are estimated using Markov
chain Monte Carlo methods. Finally, appropriate goodness-of-fit tests and model
selection criteria confirm that Model II significantly outperforms Model I in
estimation and forecasting of extremes.

no inorganic filler were used in this work. The R3 model described the thermal

coefficients $\rho_q$ that are processed here to construct a distance matrix.
Conventional MST with detrending corresponds in this context to $q=2$. We apply
the $q$MSTs to sample empirical data from the stock market and discuss the
results. We show that the $q$MST graphs can complement $\rho_q$ in
disentangling correlations that cannot be observed by the MST graphs based on
$\rho_{\rm DCCA}$ and, therefore, they can be useful in many areas where the
multivariate cross-correlations are of interest. We apply our method to data
from the stock market and obtain more information about correlation structure
of the data than by using $q=2$ only. We show that two sets of signals that
differ from each other statistically can give comparable trees for $q=2$, while
only by using the trees for $q \ne 2$ we become able to distinguish between
these sets. We also show that a family of $q$MSTs for a range of $q$ express
the diversity of correlations in a manner resembling the multifractal analysis,
where one computes a spectrum of the generalized fractal dimensions, the
generalized Hurst exponents, or the multifractal singularity spectra: the more
diverse the correlations are, the more variable the tree topology is for
different $q$s. Our analysis exhibits that the stocks belonging to the same or
