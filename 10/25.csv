  (un)deformed algebra approach using self dual variables","26 pages",,,,"gr-qc astro-ph.CO hep-th","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Scalar cosmological perturbations in loop quantum cosmology (LQC) is
revisited in a covariant manner, using self dual Ashtekar variables. For
real-valued Ashtekar-Barbero variables, this `deformed algebra' approach has
been shown to implement holonomy corrections from loop quantum gravity (LQG) in
a consistent manner, albeit deforming the algebra of modified constraints in
the process. This deformation has serious conceptual ramifications, not the
least of them being an effective `signature-change' in the deep quantum regime.
In this paper, we show that working with self dual variables lead to an
undeformed algebra of hypersurface deformations, even after including holonomy
corrections in the effective constraints. As a necessary consequence, the
diffeomorphism constraint picks up non-perturbative quantum corrections thus
hinting at a modification of the underlying space-time structure, a novel
ingredient compared to the usual treatment of (spatial) diffeomorphisms in LQG.
This work extends a similar result obtained in the context of spherically
symmetric gravity coupled to a scalar field, suggesting that self dual
variables could be better suited than their real counterparts to treat
inhomogeneous LQG models.

found that when the temperature difference is smaller than a critical value,

the heat conductivity tends to diverge linearly with the system size.

resonance image segmentation. This label fusion method is formulated on a

feature vectors are generated, including intensity, gradient and structural
signature. To select candidate atlas nodes for fusion, rather than exact
searching, randomized k-d tree with spatial constraint is introduced as an
efficient approximation for high-dimensional feature matching. Feature
Sensitive Label Prior (FSLP), which takes both the consistency and variety of
different features into consideration, is proposed to gather atlas priors. As
FSLP is a non-convex problem, one heuristic approach is further designed to
solve it efficiently. Moreover, based on the anatomical knowledge, parts of the
target pixels are also employed as graph seeds to assist the label fusion
process and an iterative strategy is utilized to gradually update the label
map. The comprehensive experiments carried out on two publicly available
databases give results to demonstrate that the proposed method can obtain
better segmentation quality.

conformal boundary conditions of the UV fixed point. For the 2D critical Ising
model perturbed by a generic relevant operator we find the assignment of RG
boundary conditions to all flows. We use some analytic results but mostly rely
on TCSA and TFFSA numerical techniques. We investigate real as well as
imaginary values of the magnetic field and, in particular, the RG trajectory
that ends at the Yang-Lee CFT. We argue that the RG interface in the latter
case does not approach a single conformal interface but rather exhibits
oscillatory non-convergent behaviour.

the 3-dimensional sphere, i.e. a Heegaard Floer homology
$\operatorname{\widehat{HFT}}$ for tangles in the closed 3-ball.
  After studying basic properties of $\operatorname{\widehat{HFT}}$ and its
decategorified tangle invariant $\nabla_T^s$, we prove a glueing theorem in
terms of Zarev's bordered sutured Floer homology, which endows
$\operatorname{\widehat{HFT}}$ with an additional glueing structure. For
4-ended tangles, we repackage this glueing structure into certain curved
complexes $\operatorname{CFT}^\partial$, which we call peculiar modules. This
allows us to easily recover oriented and unoriented skein relations for
$\operatorname{\widehat{HFL}}$.
  Our peculiar modules enjoy some symmetry properties, which support a
conjecture about $\delta$-graded mutation invariance of
$\operatorname{\widehat{HFL}}$. In fact, we show that any two links related by
mutation about a $(2,-3)$-pretzel tangle have the same $\delta$-graded link
Floer homology.
  In the last part of this thesis, we explore the relationship between peculiar
modules and twisted complexes in the fully wrapped Fukaya category of the
4-punctured sphere.
  This thesis is accompanied by two Mathematica packages. The first is a tool
for computing the generators of $\operatorname{\widehat{HFT}}$ and its

successfully for the sub-domains of theoretical and experimental particle

facilitate subsampling, in order to optimize reconstruction quality, in a
variety of continuous compressed sensing problems, and the coherence structure

extends the analysis of asymptotic incoherence to cover multidimensional
reconstruction problems. It is shown that Fourier sampling and separable
wavelet sparsity in any dimension can yield the same optimal asymptotic
incoherence as in one dimensional case. Moreover in two dimensions the
coherence structure is compatible with many standard two dimensional sampling
schemes that are currently in use. However, in higher dimensional problems with
poor wavelet smoothness we demonstrate that there are considerable restrictions
on how one can subsample from the Fourier basis with optimal incoherence. This
can be remedied by using a sufficiently smooth generating wavelet. It is also
shown that using tensor bases will always provide suboptimal decay marred by

analogy between interference effects at avoided level crossings and scattering
events in disordered electronic systems. For time scales prior to full
relaxation but large compared to the decoherence time, this characteristic rate
has been accessed experimentally and its sensitivity with both the phase lag
and the dc flux detuning explored. In this way signatures of Universal
Conductance Fluctuations-like effects have recently been analized in flux
qubits and compared with a phenomenological model that only accounts for
decoherence, as a classical noise. We here solve the full dynamics of the
driven flux qubit in contact with a quantum bath employing the Floquet Markov
Master equation. Within this formalism relaxation and decoherence rates result
strongly dependent on both the phase lag and the dc flux detuning.
Consequently, the associated pattern of fluctuations in the characteristic
rates display important differences with those obtained within the mentioned
phenomenological model. In particular we demonstrate the Weak Localization-like
effect in the averages values of the relaxation rate. Our predictions can be
tested for accessible, but longer time scales than the current experimental

the phase imprinted by a Hamiltonian, with fixed energy levels but variable

bipartite entanglement monotone tailored to this interferometric setting and
proving that it never exceeds the so-called interferometric power, a quantity
which relies on more general quantum correlations beyond entanglement and
captures the relevant resource. We then prove that the interferometric power
can never increase when local commutativity-preserving operations are applied
to qubit probes, an important step to validate such a quantity as a genuine
quantum correlations monotone. These findings are accompanied by a

endogenous information acquisition. In our model, the decision maker decides
when to observe (costly) information by sampling an underlying continuous-time
stochastic process (time series) that conveys information about the potential
occurrence or non-occurrence of an adverse event which will terminate the
decision-making process. In her attempt to predict the occurrence of the
adverse event, the decision-maker follows a policy that determines when to
acquire information from the time series (continuation), and when to stop
acquiring information and make a final prediction (stopping). We show that the
optimal policy has a rendezvous structure, i.e. a structure in which whenever a
new information sample is gathered from the time series, the optimal ""date"" for
acquiring the next sample becomes computable. The optimal interval between two
information samples balances a trade-off between the decision maker's surprise,
i.e. the drift in her posterior belief after observing new information, and
suspense, i.e. the probability that the adverse event occurs in the time
interval between two information samples. Moreover, we characterize the
continuation and stopping regions in the decision-maker's state-space, and show
that they depend not only on the decision-maker's beliefs, but also on the
context, i.e. the current realization of the time series.

understanding the hemodynamics of heart morphogenesis. In particular,
ventricular trabeculation is governed by a delicate interaction between
hemodynamic forces, myocardial activity, and morphogen gradients, all of which
are coupled to genetic regulatory networks. The underlying hemodynamics at the
stage of development in which the trabeculae form is particularly complex,
given the balance between inertial and viscous forces. Small perturbations in
the geometry, scale, and steadiness of the flow can lead to changes in the
overall flow structures and chemical morphogen gradients, including the local
direction of flow, the transport of morphogens, and the formation of vortices.
The immersed boundary method was used to solve the fluid-structure interaction
problem of fluid flow moving through a two chambered heart of a zebrafish
(\emph{Danio rerio}), with a trabeculated ventricle, at $96\ hpf$ (hours post
fertilization). Trabeculae heights and hematocrit were varied, and simulations
were conducted for two orders of magnitude of Womersley number, extending
beyond the biologically relevant range ($0.2$ -- $12.0$). Both intracardial and
intertrabecular vortices formed in the ventricle for biologically relevant
parameter values. The bifurcation from smooth streaming flow to vortical flow
depends upon the trabeculae geometry, hematocrit, and $Wo$. This work shows the
importance of hematocrit and geometry in determining the bulk flow patterns in
the heart at this stage of development.

polymer melts described with microscopic detail by sequentially backmapping
coarse-grained (CG) configurations. The microscopic test model is generic but
retains features like hard excluded volume interactions and realistic melt
densities. The microscopic representation is mapped onto a model of soft
spheres with fluctuating size, where each sphere represents a microscopic
subchain with $N_{\rm b}$ monomers. By varying $N_{\rm b}$ a hierarchy of CG
representations at different resolutions is obtained. Within this hierarchy, CG
configurations equilibrated with Monte Carlo at low resolution are sequentially
fine-grained into CG melts described with higher resolution. A Molecular
Dynamics scheme is employed to slowly introduce the microscopic details into
the latter. All backmapping steps involve only local polymer relaxation thus
the computational efficiency of the scheme is independent of molecular weight,
being just proportional to system size. To demonstrate the robustness of the
approach, microscopic configurations containing up to $n=1000$ chains with
polymerization degrees $N=2000$ are generated and equilibration is confirmed by
monitoring key structural and conformational properties. The extension to much
longer chains or branched polymers is straightforward.

molecules. Considering the presence of high population of vacancies in
phosphorene, we investigate the interaction of H2O and O2 molecules with
vacancy-contained phosphorene using first-principles calculations. In contrast
to the common notion that physisorbed molecules tend to have a stronger
adsorption at vacancy sites, we show that H2O has nearly the same adsorption
energy at the vacancy site as that at the perfect one. Charge transfer analysis
shows that O2 is a strong electron scavenger, which transfers the lone-pair
electrons of the phosphorus atoms to the 2{\pi}* antibonding orbital of O2. As
a result, the barrier for the O-O bond splitting to form O-P bonds is reduced
from 0.81 eV at the perfect site to 0.59 eV at the defect site, leading to an
about 5000 faster oxidizing rate at the defect site than at the perfect site at
room temperature. Hence, our work reveals that the vacancy in phosphorene shows
a stronger oxygen affinity than the perfect phosphorene lattice site.
Structural degradation of phosphorene due to oxidization may occur rapidly at
edges and grain boundaries where vacancies tend to agglomerate.

bead-spring model, varying chain stiffness and density to mimic chemical
diversity. In a renormalization group-like fashion library samples provide a
universal blob-based description, hierarchically backmapped to create

experimentally-relevant invariant degree of polymerizations (so far accessible

Two varieties can be distinguished. One class is made up by SB1 binaries,
companions being white dwarfs as well, another class, the so-called EL CVn
stars, are composite spectrum binaries, with A-Type companions. Pulsating stars
are found among both classes. A riddle is posed by the apparently single

evolutionary scenarios explain the origin of sdB stars as red giants that have
been stripped close to the tip of first red giant branch. A subgroup of
subluminous B stars can also be identified as stripped helium-cores of red

is derived in a variational Bayesian framework where the goal is to provide a
good approximation to the posterior distribution in order to compute posterior

the difficulties raised by the intricate forms of the non-Gaussian likelihood

existence of the dimuon excess around 30 GeV with a branching fraction for Z ->
b bar{b} mu^+ mu^- around 1.1 X 10^{-5}. In this letter, we discuss three
different types of simplified models for this possible excess. In the first
class of models, we assume a new resonance couples to both b bar{b} and mu^+
mu^-. Within the allowed parameter space for the ALEPH data, this type of
models is excluded because of too large Drell-Yan production of dimuon from the
b bar{b} collision at the LHC. In the second model, we assume that the 30 GeV
excess is a new gauge boson Z' that couples to the SM b and a new vectorlike
singlet B quark heavier than Z and not to b bar{b}. Then one can account for
the ALEPH data without conflict with the DY constraint. The new vectorlike
quark B can be pair produced at the LHC 8/13 TeV by QCD with sigma(BB) ~
O(100-1000) pb, and Bq production rate is sigma(Bq) ~ a few pb which is larger
than sigma(Bb) roughly by an order of magnitude. Their signatures at the LHC
would be 2b + 4mu, bj + 2mu and 2b + 2mu, respectively, which however might
have been excluded already by LHC run I and II data since the multi-muon events
have low SM background and are rare at the LHC. In the third model, we consider
Z -> Z' phi followed by Z' -> mu^+ mu^- and phi -> b bar{b} assuming that the
Higgs field for Z' mass is also charged under the SM U(1)_Y gauge symmetry. In
this class of model, we could accommodate the Br(Z -> b bar{b} mu^+ mu^-) ~ 1.1
X 10^{-5} if we assume very large U(1)' charge for the U(1)' breaking Higgs
field. Finally, we study various kinematic distributions of muons and b jets in
all the three models, and find that none of the models we consider in this

In this study, we took advantage of the two short series of observations in the
He II 304 \r{A} line obtained by the TESIS solar observatory with a cadence of
up to 3.5 s to study the dynamics of macrospicules in unprecedented detail. We
used a one-dimensional hydrodynamic method based on the assumption of their
axial symmetry and on a simple radiative transfer model to reconstruct the
evolution of the internal velocity field of 18 macrospicules from this dataset.
Besides the internal dynamics, we studied the motion of the apparent end points
of the same 18 macrospicules and found 15 of them to follow parabolic
trajectories with high precision which correspond closely to the obtained
velocity fields. We found that in a clear, unperturbed case these macrospicules
move with a constant deceleration inconsistent with a purely ballistic motion
and have roughly the same velocity along their entire axis, with the obtained
decelerations typically ranging from 160 to 230 m/s^2, and initial velocities
from 80 to 130 km/s. We also found a propagating acoustic wave for one of the
macrospicules and a clear linear correlation between the initial velocities of
the macrospicules and their decelerations, which indicates that they may be
driven by magneto-acoustic shocks. Finally, we inverted our previous method by
taking velocities from the parabolic fits to give rough estimates of the
percentage of mass lost by 12 of the macrospicules. We found that typically
from 10 to 30% of their observed mass fades out of the line (presumably being
heated to higher coronal temperatures) with three exceptions of 50% and one of
80%.

MOND may be in view. This is based on their claim that their highly-restricted
sample of $\Lambda$CDM-simulated galaxies are ""consistent"" with the observed
MOND mass-discrepancy-acceleration relation (MDAR), in particular, with its
recent update by McGaugh et al. (2016), based on the SPARC sample. From this
they extrapolate to ""$\Lambda$CDM is fully consistent"" with the MDAR. I explain
why these simulated galaxies do not show that $\Lambda$CDM accounts for the
MDAR. a. Their sample of simulated galaxies contains only 18 high-mass
galaxies, within a narrow range of one order of magnitude in baryonic mass, at
the very high end of the observed, SPARC sample, which spans 4.5 orders of
magnitude in mass. More importantly, the simulated sample has none of the
low-mass, low-acceleration galaxies -- abundant in SPARC -- which encapsulate
the crux and the nontrivial aspects of the predicted and observed MDAR. The
low-acceleration part of the simulated MDAR is achieved, rather trivially, from
the flattish-velocity-curve regions of the simulated high-mass galaxies. b.
Half of the simulated galaxies have ""wrong"" rotation curves that differ greatly
from any observed ones. This, does not prevent these wrong galaxies from lying
on the observed MDAR (for trivial reasons, again). They, in fact, define the
high-acceleration branch of the simulated MDAR. c. To boot, even if
$\Lambda$CDM were made ""consistent"" with the MDAR through the elaborate
adjustments that the simulations allow, this would not obviate MOND, which
predicts much more than the MDAR.

prudent self-avoiding walk (referred to by the acronym IPSAW) and in particular
to its collapse transition. The interaction intensity is denoted by $\beta>0$
and the set of trajectories consists of those self-avoiding paths respecting
the prudent condition, which means that they do not take a step towards a
previously visited lattice site. The IPSAW interpolates between the interacting
partially directed self-avoiding walk (IPDSAW) that was analyzed in details in,
e.g., [Zwanzig and Lauritzen, 1968], [Brak et al., 1992], [Carmona, Nguyen and
P\'etr\'elis, 2013-2016], and the interacting self-avoiding walk (ISAW) for
which the collapse transition was conjectured in [Saleur, 1986]. Three main
theorems are proven. We show first that IPSAW undergoes a collapse transition
at finite temperature and, up to our knowledge, there was so far no proof in
the literature of the existence of a collapse transition for a non-directed
model built with self-avoiding path. We also prove that the free energy of
IPSAW is equal to that of a restricted version of IPSAW, i.e., the interacting
two-sided prudent walk. Such free energy is computed by considering only those
prudent path with a general north-east orientation. As a by-product of this
result we obtain that the exponential growth rate of generic prudent paths
equals that of two-sided prudent paths and this answers an open problem raised
in e.g., [Bousquet-M\'elou, 2010] or [Dethridge and Guttmann, 2008]. Finally we
show that, for every $\beta>0$, the free energy of ISAW itself is always larger
than $\beta$ and this rules out a possible self-touching saturation of ISAW in
its conjectured collapsed phase.

continuously generated data in the real world tend to be temporally correlated,
and such correlations can be acquired by adversaries. In this paper, we
investigate the potential privacy loss of a traditional DP mechanism under
temporal correlations in the context of continuous data release. First, we
model the temporal correlations using Markov model and analyze the privacy
leakage of a DP mechanism when adversaries have knowledge of such temporal
correlations. Our analysis reveals that the privacy leakage of a DP mechanism
may accumulate and increase over time. We call it temporal privacy leakage.
Second, to measure such privacy leakage, we design an efficient algorithm for
calculating it in polynomial time. Although the temporal privacy leakage may
increase over time, we also show that its supremum may exist in some cases.
Third, to bound the privacy loss, we propose mechanisms that convert any
existing DP mechanism into one against temporal privacy leakage. Experiments
with synthetic data confirm that our approach is efficient and effective.

distribution of the DM pair and, consequently, the shape of the (observable)

LHC, with a luminosity of 300 fb$^{-1}$, certain classes of EFT operators can
be distinguished from each other. Hence, since DM spin is partly correlated
with the factors defining the shape of MET, the LHC can potentially shed a
light also on DM spin. We have also observed a drastic difference in the
efficiencies (up to two orders of magnitude) for large MET cuts scenarios with
different DM spin, thus indicating that the DM discovery potential strongly
depends on it. The study we perform here can be applied more generally than
within the EFT paradigm, where the DM mediator is not produced

combinatorially distinct sets of gene lineages that can reach a given node of
the species tree. They have been introduced as a data structure for use in the
recursive computation of the conditional probability under the multispecies
coalescent model of a gene tree topology given a species tree, the cost of this
computation being affected by the number of ancestral configurations of the
gene tree in the species tree. For matching gene trees and species trees, we
obtain enumerative results on ancestral configurations. We study ancestral
configurations in balanced and unbalanced families of trees determined by a
given seed tree, showing that for seed trees with more than one taxon, the
number of ancestral configurations increases for both families exponentially in
the number of taxa $n$. For fixed $n$, the maximal number of ancestral
configurations tabulated at the species tree root node and the largest number
of labeled histories possible for a labeled topology occur for trees with
precisely the same unlabeled shape. For ancestral configurations at the root,
the maximum increases with $k_0^n$, where $k_0 \approx 1.5028$ is a quadratic
recurrence constant. Under a uniform distribution over the set of labeled trees
of given size, the mean number of root ancestral configurations grows with
$\sqrt{3/2}(4/3)^n$ and the variance with approximately $1.4048(1.8215)^n$. The
results provide a contribution to the combinatorial study of gene trees and

lack the quantitative framework necessary for rigorous statistical analysis of

we develop such a framework with corresponding moment-based parameter
estimation techniques for continuous-time, multi-type branching processes. Such
processes provide a probabilistic model of how cells divide and differentiate,
and we apply our method to study hematopoiesis, the mechanism of blood cell
production. We derive closed-form expressions for higher moments in a general
class of such models. These analytical results allow us to efficiently estimate
parameters of much richer statistical models of hematopoiesis than those used
in previous statistical studies. After validating the methodology in simulation
studies, we apply our estimator to hematopoietic lineage tracking data from
rhesus macaques. Our analysis provides a more complete understanding of cell
fate decisions during hematopoiesis in non-human primates, which may be more
relevant to human biology and clinical strategies than previous findings from
murine studies. For example, in addition to previously estimated hematopoietic
stem cell self-renewal rate, we are able to estimate fate decision
probabilities and to compare structurally distinct models of hematopoiesis
using cross validation. These estimates of fate decision probabilities and our
model selection results should help biologists compare competing hypotheses
about how progenitor cells differentiate. The methodology is transferrable to a
large class of stochastic compartmental models and multi-type branching models,
commonly used in studies of cancer progression, epidemiology, and many other
fields.

indicative of various effects such as efficient radial mixing from tidal
torques, rapid accretion of low-metallicity gas, etc., which can affect the gas
and metallicity distributions in individual galaxies. Based upon an exhaustive
sample of all existing sub-kpc metallicity gradients at high-z, we find that
predictions given by analytical chemical evolution models assuming a relatively
extended star-formation profile in the early disk formation phase can explain
the majority of observed gradients, without involving galactic feedback or
radial outflows. We observe a tentative correlation between stellar mass and
metallicity gradient, consistent with the downsizing galaxy formation picture
that more massive galaxies are more evolved into a later phase of disk growth,
where they experience more coherent mass assembly at all radii and thus show
shallower metallicity gradients. In addition, we compile a sample of
homogeneously cross-calibrated integrated metallicity measurements spanning
three orders of magnitude in stellar mass at $z\sim1.8$. We use this sample to
study the mass-metallicity relation (MZR) and test the fundamental metallicity
relation (FMR). The slope of the observed MZR can rule out the momentum-driven
wind model at 3-$\sigma$ confidence level. We find no significant offset with

layers from optical coherence tomography (OCT) image stacks of healthy patients
and patients with diabetic macular edema (DME). First, each image in the OCT
stack is denoised using a Wiener deconvolution algorithm that estimates the
additive speckle noise variance using a novel Fourier-domain based structural
error. This denoising method enhances the image SNR by an average of 12dB.
Next, the denoised images are subjected to an iterative multi-resolution
high-pass filtering algorithm that detects seven sub-retinal surfaces in six
iterative steps. The thicknesses of each sub-retinal layer for all scans from a
particular OCT stack are then compared to the manually marked groundtruth. The
proposed system uses adaptive thresholds for denoising and segmenting each
image and hence it is robust to disruptions in the retinal micro-structure due
to DME. The proposed denoising and segmentation system has an average error of
1.2-5.8 $\mu m$ and 3.5-26$\mu m$ for segmenting sub-retinal surfaces in normal
and abnormal images with DME, respectively. For estimating the sub-retinal
layer thicknesses, the proposed system has an average error of 0.2-2.5 $\mu m$
and 1.8-18 $\mu m$ in normal and abnormal images, respectively. Additionally,
the average inner sub-retinal layer thickness in abnormal images is estimated
as 275$\mu m (r=0.92)$ with an average error of 9.3 $\mu m$, while the average
thickness of the outer layers in abnormal images is estimated as 57.4$\mu m
(r=0.74)$ with an average error of 3.5 $\mu m$. The proposed system can be
useful for tracking the disease progression for DME over a period of time.

the parameters considered, the boundary modifies the VACF and AVACF such that
three distinct regimes are discernible --- an initial exponential decay,
followed by an algebraic decay culminating in a second exponential decay. The
first is due to thermal noise, the algebraic regime is due to both thermal
noise and hydrodynamic correlations, while the second exponential decay shows
the effect of momentum reflection from the confining wall. Our predictions
display excellent comparison with published results for the algebraic regime

approximation are treated solving Wetterich's FRG flow equations. Nuclear
thermodynamics and the nuclear liquid-gas phase transition are investigated in
detail, both in symmetric matter and as a function of the proton fraction in
asymmetric matter. The equations of state at zero temperature of symmetric
nuclear matter and pure neutron matter are found to be in good agreement with
advanced ab-initio many-body computations. Contacts with perturbative many-body
approaches (in-medium chiral perturbation theory) are discussed. As an
interesting test case, the density dependence of the pion mass in the medium is
investigated. The question of chiral symmetry restoration in nuclear and
neutron matter is addressed. A stabilization of the phase with spontaneously
broken chiral symmetry is found to persist up to high baryon densities once
fluctuations beyond mean-field are included. Neutron star matter including beta
equilibrium is discussed under the aspect of the constraints imposed by the
existence of two-solar-mass neutron stars.

classical problems in NLP; the most popular example is word2vec. However, a
single vector does not suffice to model the polysemous nature of many
(frequent) words, i.e., words with multiple meanings. In this paper, we propose
a three-fold approach for unsupervised polysemy modeling: (a) context
representations, (b) sense induction and disambiguation and (c) lexeme (as a
word and sense pair) representations. A key feature of our work is the finding
that a sentence containing a target word is well represented by a low rank
subspace, instead of a point in a vector space. We then show that the subspaces
associated with a particular sense of the target word tend to intersect over a
line (one-dimensional subspace), which we use to disambiguate senses using a
clustering algorithm that harnesses the Grassmannian geometry of the
representations. The disambiguation algorithm, which we call $K$-Grassmeans,
leads to a procedure to label the different senses of the target word in the
corpus -- yielding lexeme vector representations, all in an unsupervised manner
starting from a large (Wikipedia) corpus in English. Apart from several
prototypical target (word,sense) examples and a host of empirical studies to
intuit and justify the various geometric representations, we validate our
algorithms on standard sense induction and disambiguation datasets and present
new state-of-the-art results.

  We consider the class P of 3-dimensional combinatorial simple polytopes,
different from a tetrahedron, whose facets do not form 3- and 4-belts. This
class includes mathematical fullerenes, i.e. simple 3-polytopes with only
5-gonal and 6-gonal facets. By a theorem of Pogorelov, any polytope from P

  Our families of smooth manifolds are associated with polytopes from the class

6-dimensional quasitoric manifolds over polytopes from P. Our main result is
that both families are cohomologically rigid, i.e. two manifolds M and M' from
either of the families are diffeomorphic if and only if their cohomology rings

corresponding polytopes are combinatorially equivalent. These results are
intertwined with the classical subjects of geometry and topology, such as
combinatorics of 3-polytopes, the Four Colour Theorem, aspherical manifolds,
diffeomorphism classification of 6-manifolds and invariance of Pontryagin

Dolinar's binary-hypothesis minimum-probability-of-error receiver as the one
that optimizes the information efficiency at each time instant, based on
recursive Bayesian updates within the receiver. Using this viewpoint, we
propose a natural generalization of Dolinar's receiver design to discriminate
$M$ coherent states each of which could now be a codeword, i.e., a sequence of
$N$ coherent states each drawn from a modulation alphabet. We analyze the
channel capacity of the pure-loss optical channel with a general
coherent-processing receiver in the low-photon number regime and compare it
with the capacity achievable with direct detection and the Holevo limit
(achieving the latter would require a quantum joint-detection receiver). We
show compelling evidence that despite the optimal performance of Dolinar's
receiver for the binary coherent-state hypothesis test (either in error
probability or mutual information), the asymptotic communication rate
achievable by such a coherent-processing receiver is only as good as direct
detection. This suggests that in the infinitely-long codeword limit, all
potential benefits of coherent processing at the receiver can be obtained by
designing a good code and direct detection, with no feedback within the
receiver.

temperature-position ($T$-$z$) coupling. Along with inducing self-oscillation,
laser light causes large changes to the mechanical resonant frequency
$\omega_0$ and equilibrium position $z_0$ that cannot be neglected. We present
experimental results and a theoretical model for the motion under laser
illumination. In the model, we solve the governing nonlinear differential
equations by perturbative means to show that self-oscillation amplitude is set
by the competing effects of direct $T$-$z$ coupling and $2\omega_0$ parametric
excitation due to $T$-$\omega_0$ coupling. We then study the linearized
equations of motion to show that the optimal thermal time constant $\tau$ for
photothermal feedback is $\tau \to \infty$ rather than the widely reported
$\omega_0 \tau = 1$. Lastly, we demonstrate photothermal quality factor ($Q$)
enhancement of driven motion as a means to counteract air damping.
Understanding photothermal effects on micromechanical devices, as well as
nonlinear aspects of optics-based motion detection, can enable new device

initially well-mixed before becoming segregated due to radiative cooling. We
use non-radiative hydrodynamical simulations to explicitly examine this
assumption and find that baryons and dark matter can also be segregated because
of different physics obeyed by gas and dark matter during the build-up of the
halo. As a result, baryons in many haloes do not originate from the same
Lagrangian region as the dark matter. When using the fraction of corresponding
dark matter and gas particles in the initial conditions (the ""paired fraction"")
as a proxy of the dark matter and gas segregation strength of a halo, on
average about $25$ percent of the baryonic and dark matter of the final halo
are segregated in the initial conditions. This is at odds with the assumption
of the standard galaxy formation model. A consequence of this effect is that
the baryons and dark matter of the same halo initially experience different
tidal torques and thus their angular momentum vectors are often misaligned. The
degree of the misalignment is largely preserved during later halo assembly and
can be understood with the tidal torque theory. The result challenges the
precision of some semi-analytical approaches which utilize dark matter halo
merger trees to infer properties of gas associated to dark matter haloes.

often many qualitatively different stellar or exoplanet companion orbit models
that are consistent with the data. The consequent multimodality of the
likelihood function leads to extremely challenging search, optimization, and
MCMC posterior sampling over the orbital parameters. Here we create a custom
Monte Carlo sampler for sparse or noisy radial-velocity measurements of
two-body systems that can produce posterior samples for orbital parameters even
when the likelihood function is poorly behaved. The six standard orbital
parameters for a binary system can be split into four non-linear parameters
(period, eccentricity, argument of pericenter, phase) and two linear parameters
(velocity amplitude, barycenter velocity). We capitalize on this by building a
sampling method in which we densely sample the prior pdf in the non-linear
parameters and perform rejection sampling using a likelihood function
marginalized over the linear parameters. With sparse or uninformative data, the
sampling obtained by this rejection sampling is generally multimodal and dense.
With informative data, the sampling becomes effectively unimodal but too
sparse: in these cases we follow the rejection sampling with standard MCMC. The
method produces correct samplings in orbital parameters for data that include
as few as three epochs. The Joker can therefore be used to produce proper
samplings of multimodal pdfs, which are still informative and can be used in
hierarchical (population) modeling. We give some examples that show how the
posterior pdf depends sensitively on the number and time coverage of the
observations and their uncertainties.

find that lower-mass galaxies or galaxies at higher redshift tend to be bluer

dependence but positively correlates with galaxy effective radii due to the
aperture effect. The central density slopes obtained by combining strong
lensing measurements with single aperture kinematics are found to differ from

distributions and power-law density profiles. We also compare the properties of

cross-matches are blue-selected from a 42 square-degree region in the Galactic
Plane, capturing the Carina Arm over the Galactic longitude range $282^{\circ}
\lesssim \ell \lesssim 293^{\circ}$. Spectral energy distribution fitting is
performed on these candidates' combined VPHAS+ $u,g,r,i$ and 2MASS $J,H,K$
magnitudes. This delivers: effective temperature constraints, statistically
separating O from early-B stars; high-quality extinction parameters, $A_0$ and
$R_V$ (random errors typically $< 0.1$). The high-confidence O-B2 candidates
number 5915 and a further 5170 fit to later B spectral type. Spectroscopy of
276 of the former confirms 97% of them. The fraction of emission line stars
among all candidate B stars is 7--8% . Greyer ($R_V > 3.5$) extinction laws are
ubiquitous in the region, over the distance range 2.5--3 kpc to $\sim$10~kpc.
Near prominent massive clusters, $R_V$ tends to rise, with particularly large
and chaotic excursions to $R_V \sim 5$ seen in the Carina Nebula. The data
reveal a hitherto unnoticed association of 108 O-B2 stars around the O5If$+$
star LSS 2063 ($\ell = 289.77^{\circ}$, $b = -1.22^{\circ}$). Treating the OB
star scale-height as a constant within the thin disk, we find an orderly mean
relation between extinction ($A_0$) and distance in the Galactic longitude
range, $287.6^{\circ} < \ell < 293.5^{\circ}$, and infer the subtle onset of
thin-disk warping. A halo around NGC 3603, roughly a degree in diameter, of
$\sim$500 O-B2 stars with $4 < A_0 (\rm{mag}) < 7$ is noted.

demonstrate that a driven transverse-field Ising model can be used to engineer

This phase remains stable only within a parametric time scale controlled by the
driving frequency, beyond which its topological features break down. To
overcome this issue, we consider an alternate route based upon realizing an
intrinsically Floquet SPT phase that does not have any equilibrium analog. In
both cases, we show that disorder, leading to many-body localization, prevents
runaway heating and enables the observation of coherent quantum dynamics at
high energy densities. Furthermore, we clarify the distinction between the
equilibrium and Floquet SPT phases by identifying a unique micromotion-based
entanglement spectrum signature of the latter. Finally, we propose a unifying
implementation in a one-dimensional chain of Rydberg-dressed atoms and show
that protected edge modes are observable on realistic experimental time scales.

primary was claimed to have a stellar mass greater than 300Msun, making it a
candidate for the most massive star known. While the primary is a known late
type, H-rich Wolf-Rayet star (WN6h), the secondary could not be so far
unambiguously detected. Using moderate resolution spectra, we are able to
derive accurate radial velocities for both components. By performing
simultaneous orbital and polarimetric analyses, we derive the complete set of
orbital parameters, including the inclination. The spectra are disentangled and
spectroscopically analyzed, and an analysis of the wind-wind collision zone is
conducted.
  The disentangled spectra and our models are consistent with a WN6h type for
the primary, and suggest that the secondary is an O3.5 If*/WN7 type star. We
derive a high eccentricity of e = 0.78 and minimum masses of M1 sin^3 i ~ M2
sin^3 i ~ 13 +- 2 Msun, with q = M2 / M1 = 1.01 +- 0.07. An analysis of
emission excess stemming from a wind-wind collision yields a similar
inclination to that obtained from polarimetry (i = 39 +- 6deg). Our analysis
thus implies M1 = 53^{+40}_{-20} and M2 = 54^{+40}_{-20} Msun, excluding M1 >
300Msun. A detailed comparison with evolution tracks calculated for single and
binary stars, as well as the high eccentricity, suggest that the components of
the system underwent quasi-homogeneous evolution and avoided mass-transfer.
This scenario would suggest current masses of ~ 80 Msun and initial masses of
Mi,1 ~ 105 and Mi,2 ~ 90Msun, consistent with the upper limits of our derived

efficient numerical routines for calculating positive and negative-energy

energy arises in scale invariant theories and can be derived within the context

current density, but also by oscillations of the chiral current density. The
latter are triggered by a dynamical version of the chiral electric separation
effect. We also find that the plasma frequencies of the transverse modes split
up in a magnetic field. This finding suggests an efficient means of extracting
the chiral shift parameter from the measurement of the plasma frequencies in
Weyl materials.

In this manuscript we propose a condensed matter realization of SUSY on the
edge of a Read-Rezayi quantum Hall state, given by filling factors of the form
$\nu =\frac{k}{k+2}$, where $k$ is an integer. As we show, this strongly
interacting state exhibits an $\mathcal{N}=2$ SUSY. This allows us to use a
topological invariant - the Witten index - defined specifically for
supersymmetric theories, to count the difference between the number of bosonic

edge hosts $k+1$ protected zero-modes. We further discuss the stability of SUSY
with respect to generic perturbations, and find that much of the above results
remain unchanged. In particular, these results directly apply to the
well-established $\nu=1/3$ Laughlin state, in which case SUSY is a highly
robust property of the edge theory. These results unveil a hidden topological
structure on the long-studied Read-Rezayi states.

jobs need to be assigned to one of the machines and the goal is to minimize the

scheduling for makespan minimization (case l_infty) and has been thoroughly
studied. However, despite the recent push for beyond worst-case analyses, no
such results are known for this problem. In this paper we provide algorithms
with simultaneous guarantees for the worst-case model as well as for the
random-order (i.e. secretary) model, where an arbitrary set of jobs comes in
random order. First, we show that the greedy algorithm (with restart), known to
have optimal O(p) worst-case guarantee, also has a (typically) improved
random-order guarantee. However, the behavior of this algorithm in the
random-order model degrades with p. We then propose algorithm SIMULTANEOUSLB
that has simultaneously optimal guarantees (within constants) in both
worst-case and random-order models. In particular, the random-order guarantee
of SIMULTANEOUSLB improves as p increases.
  One of the main components is a new algorithm with improved regret for Online
Linear Optimization (OLO) over the non-negative vectors in the lq ball.
Interestingly, this OLO algorithm is also used to prove a purely probabilistic
inequality that controls the correlations arising in the random-order model, a
common source of difficulty for the analysis. Another important component used
in both SIMULTANEOUSLB and our OLO algorithm is a smoothing of the lp-norm that
may be of independent interest. This smoothness property allows us to see
algorithm SIMULTANEOUSLB as essentially a greedy one in the worst-case model
and as a primal-dual one in the random-order model, which is instrumental for
its simultaneous guarantees.

always possible. There is thus an intrinsic error associated to the measurement
device, which we aim to quantify, that limits its discrimination power. We
minimize various error probabilities (averaged or constrained) over all pairs

decrease in the case of large $n$, give measures of the discrimination power of
the device. For the asymptotic rate of the averaged error probability, we
obtain a Chernoff-type bound, dual to the standard Chernoff bound for which the

point in the derivation is that i.i.d. states become optimal in asymptotic
settings. Minimum asymptotic rates are also obtained for constrained error

Jacobson-Morozov parabolic subgroup of G associated to e. This result was shown
in some cases by Barbasch and Vogan in their study of unipotent representations
for complex groups and, in general, in an unpublished part of the author's
doctoral thesis. In the last section of the article, we state two applications
of this result, whose details will appear elsewhere: to answering a question of
Lusztig regarding special pieces in the exceptional groups (joint work with Fu,
Juteau, and Levy); and to computing the G-module structure of the sections of
an irreducible local system on O. A key aspect of the latter application is
some new cohomological statements that generalize those in earlier work of the

efficient, it is important to control charge carrier at lengths approaching the
nanometer scale. Traditional gating techniques based on capacitive coupling
through a gate dielectric cannot generate strong and uniform electric fields at
this scale due to divergence of the fields in dielectrics. This field
divergence limits the gating strength, boundary sharpness, and pitch size of
periodic structures, and restricts possible geometries of local gates (due to
wire packaging), precluding certain device concepts, such as plasmonics and
transformation optics based on metamaterials. Here we present a new gating
concept based on a dielectric-free self-aligned electrolyte technique that
allows spatially modulating charges with nanometer resolution. We employ a
combination of a solid-polymer electrolyte gate and an ion-impenetrable
e-beam-defined resist mask to locally create excess charges on top of the gated
surface. Electrostatic simulations indicate high carrier density variations of
$\Delta n =10^{14}\text{cm}^{-2}$ across a length of 10 nm at the mask
boundaries on the surface of a 2D conductor, resulting in a sharp depletion
region and a strong in-plane electric field of $6\times10^8 \text{Vm}^{-1}$
across the so-created junction. We apply this technique to the 2D material
graphene to demonstrate the creation of tunable p-n junctions for
optoelectronic applications. We also demonstrate the spatial versatility and
self-aligned properties of this technique by introducing a novel graphene
thermopile photodetector.

been attributed to synchrotron radiation from particles accelerated by
diffusive shock acceleration (DSA) in the wind-collision region (WCR). If the
magnetic field in the strong shocks is ordered, its component parallel to the
shock front should be enhanced, and the resultant synchrotron radiation would
be polarized. However, such polarization has never been measured. We performed
spatially-unresolved radio continuum observations of WR 146, a well known a
WC6+O8 system, at 5 cm and 20 cm with the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array. No
linearly polarized radio emission was detected. The data constrain the
fractional linear polarization to less than 0.6% between 1 to 8 GHz. This is
compatible with a high level of turbulence and a dominant random component in
the magnetic field. In this case the relativistic particles could be produced
by turbulent magnetic reconnection (MR). In order for this scenario to satisfy
the required non-thermal energy budget, we find through numerical modeling that
the strength of the magnetic field in the WCR must be as high as ~150 mG.
However, if the magnetic field is ordered and DSA is ongoing, then a
combination of internal and external Faraday rotation could equally account for
the depolarization of the emission. It is not clear whether it is possible to
develop the high level of turbulence and strong magnetic fields required for
efficient MR in a long-period binary such as WR 146. This scenario might also
have trouble explaining the low-frequency cutoff in the spectrum. We therefore
favor a scenario where particles are accelerated through DSA and the
depolarization is produced by mechanisms other than a large ratio between
random to regular magnetic fields.

the largest dataset of its kind ever analysed in one study, and many of the
objects have complementary photometric data. We determined the peak and total
luminosity, velocity of the peak, HWHM intensity, and profile shape for many
emission lines. Temporal evolution of these values and various flux ratios are
studied. We also investigate the correlations between these measurements and
photometric observables, such as the peak and plateau absolute magnitudes and
the late-time light curve decline rates in various optical bands. The strongest
and most robust result we find is that the luminosities of all spectral
features (except those of helium) tend to be higher in objects with steeper
late-time V-band decline rates. A steep late-time V-band slope likely arises
from less efficient trapping of gamma-rays and positrons, which could be caused
by multidimensional effects such as clumping of the ejecta or asphericity of
the explosion itself. Furthermore, if gamma-rays and positrons can escape more
easily, then so can photons via the observed emission lines, leading to more
luminous spectral features. It is also shown that SNe IIP with larger
progenitor stars have ejecta with a more physically extended oxygen layer that
is well-mixed with the hydrogen layer. In addition, we find a subset of objects
with evidence for asymmetric Ni-56 ejection, likely bipolar in shape. We also
compare our observations to theoretical late-time spectral models of SNe IIP
from two separate groups and find moderate-to-good agreement with both sets of
models. Our SNe IIP spectra are consistent with models of 12-15 M_Sun
progenitor stars having relatively low metallicity (Z $\le$ 0.01).

a search engine ranking algorithm, a typical question that arises is, will its
performance exceed that of the current treatment? The conventional way to
answer this counterfactual question is to estimate the effect of the new
treatment in comparison to that of the conventional treatment by running a
controlled, randomized experiment. While this approach theoretically ensures an
unbiased estimator, it suffers from several drawbacks, including the difficulty
in finding representative experimental populations as well as the cost of
running such trials. Moreover, such trials neglect the huge quantities of
available control-condition data which are often completely ignored.
  In this paper we propose a discriminative framework for estimating the
performance of a new treatment given a large dataset of the control condition
and data from a small (and possibly unrepresentative) randomized trial
comparing new and old treatments. Our objective, which requires minimal
assumptions on the treatments, models the relation between the outcomes of the
different conditions. This allows us to not only estimate mean effects but also
to generate individual predictions for examples outside the randomized sample.
  We demonstrate the utility of our approach through experiments in three
areas: Search engine operation, treatments to diabetes patients, and market
value estimation for houses. Our results demonstrate that our approach can
reduce the number and size of the currently performed randomized controlled
experiments, thus saving significant time, money and effort on the part of
practitioners.

small payloads, low-latency requirements and/or insufficient energy resources
to support longer transmissions. In this paper, a wirelessly powered
communication system is investigated where an energy harvesting transmitter,
charged by one or more power beacons via wireless energy transfer, attempts to
communicate with a receiver over a noisy channel. Under a save-then-transmit
protocol, the system performance is characterized using metrics such as the
energy supply probability at the transmitter, and the achievable rate at the
receiver for the case of short packets. Leveraging the framework of
finite-length information theory, tractable analytical expressions are derived
for the considered metrics in terms of system parameters such as the harvest
blocklength, the transmit blocklength, the harvested power and the transmit
power. The analysis provides several useful design guidelines. Though using a
small transmit power or a small transmit blocklength helps avoid energy
outages, the consequently smaller signal-to-noise ratio or the fewer coding
opportunities may cause an information outage. Scaling laws are derived to
capture this inherent trade-off between the harvest and transmit blocklengths.
Moreover, the asymptotically optimal transmit power is derived in closed-form.
Numerical results reveal that power control is essential for improving the
achievable rate of the system in the finite blocklength regime. The
asymptotically optimal transmit power yields nearly optimal performance in the
finite blocklength regime.

At the grid scale these forecasts often do not compare well with observations.
This is partly due to the chaotic system underlying the weather. Another key
problem is that it is impossible to evaluate the risk of making decisions based
on these forecasts because they do not provide a measure of confidence.
Ensembles provide this information in the ensemble spread and quartiles.
However, running global ensembles at the meso or sub mesoscale involves
substantial computational resources. National centers do run such ensembles,
but the subject of this publication is a method which requires significantly
less computation. The ensemble enhanced mesoscale system presented here aims
not at the creation of an improved mesoscale forecast model. Also it is not to

detection of extrema and selective ensembles. The subject of this publication

time series. In the second approach, the factors signals are linear filtered
versions of the original signal which is more general than an instantaneous
mixing. This exploratory analysis is the starting point to the multi-scale
factor analysis model where the concatenated factors from all regions are
represented by vector auto-regressive model that captures the connectivity in
high dimensional signals. We performed evaluations on the two approaches via
simulations under different conditions. The simulation results provide insights
on the performance and application scope of the methods. We also performed
exploratory analysis of EEG recorded over several epochs during resting state.

consumption in buildings. Shared spaces constitute considerable office space
area, in which most office employees perform their meetings and daily tasks,
and therefore the ACs in these areas have significant impact on the energy
usage of the entire office building. The cost of this energy consumption,
however, is not paid by the shared space users, and the AC's temperature
set-point is not determined based on the users' preferences. This latter factor
is compounded by the fact that different people may have different choices of
temperature set-points and sensitivities to change of temperature. Therefore,
it is a challenging task to design an office policy to decide on a particular
set-point based on such a diverse preference set. As a result, users are not
aware of the energy consumption in shared spaces, which may potentially
increase the energy wastage and related cost of office buildings. In this
context, this paper proposes an energy policy for an office shared space by
exploiting an established temperature control mechanism. In particular, we
choose meeting rooms in an office building as the test case and design a policy
according to which each user of the room can give a preference on the
temperature set-point and is paid for felt discomfort if the set-point is not
fixed according to the given preference. On the other hand, users who enjoy the
thermal comfort compensate the other users of the room. Thus, the policy
enables the users to be cognizant and responsible for the payment on the energy
consumption of the office space they are sharing, and at the same time ensures
that the users are satisfied either via thermal comfort or through incentives.
The policy is also shown to be beneficial for building management. Through
experiment based case studies, we show the effectiveness of the proposed
policy.

properties, such as the modulated band gap and the alignments of frontier

modulating the injection and confinement of carriers for optical and

shows that the chemical activities of the phosphorene are significantly
enhanced at the top and bottom peaks of the ripples, indicated by the enhanced

key idea of the proposed framework is to learn the non-linear input-output
system, formed by the concatenation of a wireless channel and a quantization
function used at the ADCs, for data detection. In this framework, a
conventional channel estimation process is replaced by a system learning
process, in which the conditional probability mass functions (PMFs) of the
nonlinear system are empirically learned by sending the repetitions of all
possible data signals as pilot signals. Then the subsequent data detection
process is performed based on the empirical conditional PMFs obtained during
the system learning. To reduce both the training overhead and the detection
complexity, we also develop a supervised-learning-aided
successive-interference-cancellation method. In this method, a data signal
vector is divided into two subvectors with reduced dimensions. Then these two
subvectors are successively detected based on the conditional PMFs that are
learned using artificial noise signals and an estimated channel. For the case
of one-bit ADCs, we derive an analytical expression for vector-error-rate of
the proposed framework under perfect channel knowledge at the receiver.
Simulations demonstrate the detection error reduction of the proposed framework
compared to conventional detection techniques that are based on channel
estimation.

However, the blessing of dimensionality has not yet been fully embraced in the
literature: much of the available data is often ignored in constructing
covariance matrix estimates. If our goal is to accurately estimate a covariance
matrix of a set of targeted variables, shall we employ additional data, which
are beyond the variables of interest, in the estimation? In this paper, we
provide sufficient conditions for an affirmative answer, and further quantify
its gain in terms of Fisher information and convergence rate. In fact, even an
oracle-like result (as if all the factors were known) can be achieved when a
sufficiently large number of variables is used. The idea of utilizing data as
much as possible brings computational challenges. A divide-and-conquer
algorithm is thus proposed to alleviate the computational burden, and also
shown not to sacrifice any statistical accuracy in comparison with a pooled

combined into a global solution using clustering. The decomposition and
resulting parallelization leads to very fast runtime even on very large

that linear sketches can be naturally composed in the distributed model and be
efficiently updated in the streaming model. The errors of linear sketches are
typically expressed in terms of the sum of coordinates of the input vector
excluding those largest ones, or, the mass on the tail of the vector. Thus, the
precondition for these algorithms to perform well is that the mass on the tail
is small, which is, however, not always the case -- in many real-world datasets
the coordinates of the input vector have a {\em bias}, which will generate a
large mass on the tail.

Hierarchical-Tucker (Sparse H-Tucker), for sparse and high-order data tensors.
Sparse H-Tucker is inspired by its namesake, the classical Hierarchical Tucker
method, which aims to compute a tree-structured factorization of an input data
set that may be readily interpreted by a domain expert. However, Sparse
H-Tucker uses a nested sampling technique to overcome a key scalability problem
in Hierarchical Tucker, which is the creation of an unwieldy intermediate dense
core tensor; the result of our approach is a faster, more space-efficient, and
more accurate method. We extensively test our method on a real healthcare
dataset, which is collected from 30K patients and results in an 18th order
sparse data tensor. Unlike competing methods, Sparse H-Tucker can analyze the
full data set on a single multi-threaded machine. It can also do so more
accurately and in less time than the state-of-the-art: on a 12th order subset
of the input data, Sparse H-Tucker is 18x more accurate and 7.5x faster than a
previously state-of-the-art method. Even for analyzing low order tensors (e.g.,
4-order), our method requires close to an order of magnitude less time and over
two orders of magnitude less memory, as compared to traditional tensor
factorization methods such as CP and Tucker. Moreover, we observe that Sparse
H-Tucker scales nearly linearly in the number of non-zero tensor elements. The
resulting model also provides an interpretable disease hierarchy, which is
confirmed by a clinical expert.

been studied extensively, and the resulted primal-dual approach has become a
powerful procedure in solving dynamic programs by providing lower-upper bounds
on the optimal value function. Theoretically, with the so called value-based
optimal dual penalty, the optimal value function could be recovered exactly via
strong duality. However, in practice, obtaining tight dual bounds usually
requires good approximations of the optimal dual penalty, which could be
time-consuming due to the conditional expectations that need to be estimated
via nested simulation. In this paper, we will develop a framework of regression
approach to approximating the optimal dual penalty in a non-nested manner, by
exploring the structure of the function space consisting of all feasible dual
penalties. The resulted approximations maintain to be feasible dual penalties,
and thus yield valid dual bounds on the optimal value function. We show that
the proposed framework is computationally efficient, and the resulted dual
penalties lead to numerically tractable dual problems. Finally, we apply the
framework to a high-dimensional dynamic trading problem to demonstrate its
effectiveness in solving the dual problems of complex dynamic programs.

applications, such as product recommendation, customized content delivery and
criminal identification. Given a set of accounts from the same or different
social network platforms, user identification attempts to identify all accounts
belonging to the same person. A commonly used solution is to build the
relationship among different accounts by exploring their collective patterns,
e.g., user profile, writing style, similar comments. However, this kind of
method doesn't work well in many practical scenarios, since the information
posted explicitly by users may be false due to various reasons. In this paper,
we re-inspect the user identification problem from a novel perspective, i.e.,
identifying user's identity by matching his/her cameras. The underlying
assumption is that multiple accounts belonging to the same person contain the
same or similar camera fingerprint information. The proposed framework, called
User Camera Identification (UCI), is based on camera fingerprints, which takes
fully into account the problems of multiple cameras and reposting behaviors.

Abadie and Gardeazabal [2003], Abadie et al. [2014], develop the synthetic
control procedure for estimating the effect of a treatment, in the presence of
a single treated unit and a number of control units, with pre-treatment
outcomes observed for all units. The method constructs a set of weights such
that selected covariates and pre-treatment outcomes of the treated unit are
approximately matched by a weighted average of control units (the synthetic
control). The weights are restricted to be nonnegative and sum to one, which is
important because it allows the procedure to obtain unique weights even when
the number of lagged outcomes is modest relative to the number of control
units, a common setting in applications. In the current paper we propose a
generalization that allows the weights to be negative, and their sum to differ
from one, and that allows for a permanent additive difference between the
treated unit and the controls, similar to difference-in-difference procedures.
The weights directly minimize the distance between the lagged outcomes for the

of rectangular objects into a strip of a given width, while minimizing the
total height of the packing. The problem has multiple applications, e.g. in
scheduling and stock-cutting, and has been studied extensively.
  When the dimensions of objects are allowed to be exponential in the total
input size, it is known that the problem cannot be approximated within a factor
better than $3/2$, unless $\mathrm{P}=\mathrm{NP}$. However, there was no
corresponding lower bound for polynomially bounded input data. In fact,
Nadiradze and Wiese [SODA 2016] have recently proposed a $(1.4 + \epsilon)$
approximation algorithm for this variant, thus showing that strip packing with
polynomially bounded data can be approximated better than when exponentially
large values in the input data are allowed. Their result has subsequently been
improved to a $(4/3 + \epsilon)$ approximation by two independent research
groups [FSTTCS 2016, arXiv:1610.04430]. This raises a question whether strip
packing with polynomially bounded input data admits a quasi-polynomial time
approximation scheme, as is the case for related two-dimensional packing
problems like maximum independent set of rectangles or two-dimensional
knapsack.
  In this paper we answer this question in negative by proving that it is
NP-hard to approximate strip packing within a factor better than $12/11$, even
when admitting only polynomially bounded input data. In particular, this shows
that the strip packing problem admits no quasi-polynomial time approximation
scheme, unless $\mathrm{NP} \subseteq \mathrm{DTIME}(2^{\mathrm{polylog}(n)})$.

The MR sequence allows simultaneous acquisition of 4 spin lock times (TSLs:

matter regions and age was investigated. Results: A regional difference among
individual gray matter areas was noted; with hippocampus (98.37+/-5.37 msec)
and amygdala (94.95+/-4.34 msec) have the highest measurement, while pallidum
(83.81+/-5.49) and putamen (83.93+4.76) the lowest measurement. T1rho values
decreased slowly (mean slope: -0.256) and significantly (p<0.05) with age in
gray matter for subjects younger than 40 years old, while for subjects older
than 40 years old there was no significant correlation between T1rho relaxation
and age. Conclusion: T1rho relaxation demonstrates a bi-phase change with age
in adults of 22-68 years.

  0.25 for Partition Matroids",,,,,"cs.DM cs.DS","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We study the online submodular maximization problem with free disposal under
a matroid constraint. Elements from some ground set arrive one by one in
rounds, and the algorithm maintains a feasible set that is independent in the
underlying matroid. In each round when a new element arrives, the algorithm may
accept the new element into its feasible set and possibly remove elements from
it, provided that the resulting set is still independent. The goal is to
maximize the value of the final feasible set under some monotone submodular
function, to which the algorithm has oracle access.
  For $k$-uniform matroids, we give a deterministic algorithm with competitive
ratio at least $0.2959$, and the ratio approaches $\frac{1}{\alpha_\infty}
\approx 0.3178$ as $k$ approaches infinity, improving the previous best ratio
of $0.25$ by Chakrabarti and Kale (IPCO 2014), Buchbinder et al. (SODA 2015)
and Chekuri et al. (ICALP 2015). We also show that our algorithm is optimal
among a class of deterministic monotone algorithms that accept a new arriving
element only if the objective is strictly increased.
  Further, we prove that no deterministic monotone algorithm can be strictly
better than $0.25$-competitive even for partition matroids, the most modest
generalization of $k$-uniform matroids, matching the competitive ratio by
Chakrabarti and Kale (IPCO 2014) and Chekuri et al. (ICALP 2015).
Interestingly, we show that randomized algorithms are strictly more powerful by
giving a (non-monotone) randomized algorithm for partition matroids with ratio
$\frac{1}{\alpha_\infty} \approx 0.3178$.

  Broadcasting in Massive MIMO Systems",,,,,"cs.IT math.IT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In this paper, we design space-time block codes (STBCs) to broadcast the
common information omnidirectionally in a massive MIMO downlink. To reduce the
burden of the downlink channel estimation and achieve partial spatial diversity
from base station (BS) transmit antennas, we propose channel-independently
precoded low-dimensional STBC. The precoding matrix and the signal
constellation in the low-dimensional STBC are jointly designed to guarantee
omnidirectional coverage at any instant time and sufficiently utilize the power
amplifier capacities of BS transmit antennas, and at the same time, achieve the
full diversity of the low-dimensional STBC. Under this framework, several
designs are presented. To provide transmit diversity order of two, a precoded
Alamouti code is proposed, which has a fast symbol-wise maximum-likelihood (ML)
decoding. To provide transmit diversity order of four, three types of STBCs are
proposed, being referred to as precoded orthogonal STBC (OSTBC), precoded
quasi-orthogonal STBC (QOSTBC), and precoded coordinate interleaved orthogonal
design (CIOD), respectively. The last two codes have the same complexity for
pair-wise ML decoding, while precoded QOSTBC has a higher coding gain when the
bit rate is lower than or equal to 4 bps/Hz, and precoded CIOD has a higher
coding gain when the bit rate is higher than 4 bps/Hz. Precoded OSTBC has a
higher decoding complexity and a lower coding gain than the other two codes,
since in the precoded OSTBC the information symbols need to be jointly designed
and decoded. Moreover, a precoded no-zero-entry Toeplitz code and a precoded
no-zero-entry overlapped Alamouti code are also proposed. These two codes can
achieve a higher diversity order with linear receivers.

multiple researchers have used text to identify, analyze and measure themes and

Given the potential of visual content for influencing users' thoughts and
emotions, we perform a large scale analysis to compare popular themes and
sentiment across images and textual content posted on Facebook during the
terror attacks that took place in Paris in 2015. Using state-of-the-art image

popular in images, but were not identifiable through text. We uncovered
instances of misinformation and false flag (conspiracy) theories among popular

that while textual content posted after the attacks reflected negative
sentiment, images inspired positive sentiment. To the best of our knowledge,
this is the first large scale study of images posted on social networks during

parameterized algorithms with running time $2^{O(k^{1-\frac{1}{1+\delta}}

rate (degree) $\delta$, that is, if we assume that every ball of radius $r$
contains only $O(r^\delta)$ vertices. The algorithms use the technique of
low-treewidth pattern covering, introduced by Fomin et al. [FOCS 2016] for
planar graphs; here we show how this strategy can be made to work for graphs
with polynomial growth.
  Formally, we prove that, given a graph $G$ of polynomial growth with growth
rate $\delta$ and an integer $k$, one can in randomized polynomial time find a
subset $A \subseteq V(G)$ such that on one hand the treewidth of $G[A]$ is
$O(k^{1-\frac{1}{1+\delta}} \log k)$, and on the other hand for every set $X
\subseteq V(G)$ of size at most $k$, the probability that $X \subseteq A$ is
$2^{-O(k^{1-\frac{1}{1+\delta}} \log^2 k)}$. Together with standard dynamic
programming techniques on graphs of bounded treewidth, this statement gives
subexponential parameterized algorithms for a number of subgraph search
problems, such as Long Path or Steiner Tree, in graphs of polynomial growth.
  We complement the algorithm with an almost tight lower bound for Long Path:
unless the Exponential Time Hypothesis fails, no parameterized algorithm with
running time $2^{k^{1-\frac{1}{\delta}-\varepsilon}}n^{O(1)}$ is possible for
any $\varepsilon > 0$ and an integer $\delta \geq 3$.

$\sim 900$ kpc, making it the longest among the known head-tail radio galaxies.
The objectives of the GMRT observations were to investigate the radio
morphology, especially of the long tail structure, at low frequencies. The
radio structure, especially initial $\sim 10$ arcmin of tail being a long
straight feature, does not seem to be consistent with a simple circular motion
around the cluster centre, as previously suggested in the literature. Two sharp
bends after the straight section of the tail cast doubt on the prevailing idea
in the literature that the long narrow tails represent trails left behind by
the fast moving parent optical galaxy with respect to the cluster medium, as
the optical galaxy could not have undergone such sharp bends in its path, under
any conceivable gravitational influence of some individual galaxy or of the
overall cluster gravitational potential. In fact the tail does not seem to have
been influenced by the gravitational field of any of the cluster-member
galaxies. The radio spectrum of the head, coinciding with the optical galaxy,
is flat ($\alpha \stackrel{<}{_{\sim}}0.4$ for $S \propto \nu ^{-\alpha}$), but
steadily steepens along the radio tail, with the end part of the tail showing
the steepest spectrum ($\alpha \, {\sim}$ 4 -- 5) ever seen in any diffuse

from simple local interactions among group members. Flocks of homing pigeons,
Columba livia, provide a useful model for the study of collective motion and
decision making. During homing flights, flock members are forced to resolve
potentially divergent navigational preferences in order to stay together and
benefit from flying in a group. Recent work has demonstrated that some
individuals consistently contribute more to the movement decisions of the flock
than others do, thereby generating stable hierarchical leader/follower
networks. Yet, what attributes of a flying pigeon reliably predict leadership
remains an open question. We examined the flexibility of an individual's
hierarchical leadership rank (i.e. its ordinal position when flock members are
ranked according to the average time differences with which they lead or follow
others) as a function of changes in its navigational knowledge. We manipulated
already established hierarchical networks in three different flocks, by
providing certain individuals with additional homing experience. We found that
such training did not consistently lead to an increase in birds' leadership
ranks, and that, in general, the nature of leader/follower interactions between
trained and untrained birds remained unaffected. Thus, leadership hierarchies
in pigeon flocks appear resistant to changes in the navigational knowledge of a
subset of their members, at least when these changes are relatively small. We
discuss the implications of our results in light of the potential benefits of
structural stability in decision-making networks.

low-resolution analog-to-digital converters (ADCs). In this system, the paper
presents a new MIMO detection approach using coding theory. The principal idea
of the proposed approach is to transform a non-linear MIMO channel to a linear
MIMO channel by leveraging both a $p$-level quantizer and a lattice code where
$p\geq 2$. After transforming to the linear MIMO channel with the sets of
finite input and output elements, efficient MIMO detection methods are proposed
to attain both diversity and multiplexing gains by using algebraic coding
theory. In particular, using the proposed methods, the analytical
characterizations of achievable rates are derived for different MIMO
configurations. One major observation is that the proposed approach is
particularly useful for a large MIMO system with the ADCs that use a few bits.

steerability restrict the implementation of Airy plasmons in these
applications. Here we reveal the hybrid Airy plasmons for the first time by
taking a hybrid graphene-based plasmonic waveguide in the terahertz (THz)
domain as an example. Due to the coupling between an optical mode and a
plasmonic mode, the hybrid Airy plasmons can have large propagation lengths and
effective transverse deflections, where the transverse waveguide confinements
are governed by the hybrid modes with moderate quality factors. Meanwhile, the
propagation trajectories of hybrid Airy plasmons are dynamically steerable by
changing the chemical potential of graphene. These hybrid Airy plasmons may
promote the further discovery of non-diffracting beams with the emerging
developments of optical tweezers and tractor beams.

system consisting of a Be-type star and a low-mass ($M\sim 1\,M_\odot$)
companion of unknown nature orbiting in the Be-disk plane. Here we apply the
quasi-spherical accretion theory onto a compact magnetized star and show that
if the low-mass companion of $\gamma$ Cas is a fast spinning neutron star, the
key observational signatures of $\gamma$ Cas are remarkably well reproduced.
Direct accretion onto this fast rotating neutron star is impeded by the
propeller mechanism. In this case, around the neutron star magnetosphere a hot
shell is formed that emits thermal X-rays in qualitative and quantitative
agreement with observed properties of the X-ray emission from $\gamma$ Cas. We
suggest that $\gamma$ Cas and its analogs constitute a new subclass of Be-type
X-ray binaries hosting rapidly rotating neutron stars formed in supernova
explosions with small kicks. The subsequent evolutionary stage of $\gamma$ Cas
and its analogs should be the X Per-type binaries comprising low-luminosity
slowly rotating X-ray pulsars. The model explains the enigmatic X-ray emission
from $\gamma$ Cas, and also establishes evolutionary connections between
various types of rotating magnetized neutron stars in Be-binaries.

problem of droplet formation occurring in a microfluidic T-shaped junction,
when the continuous phase is made of shear thinning liquids. At first, we
review in detail the breakup process providing extensive, side-by-side
comparisons between Newtonian and non-Newtonian liquids over unexplored ranges

droplets is made of Xanthan solutions, a stiff rod-like polysaccharide

shear-dependent viscous response occurring at the breakup. The droplet size can
be predicted over a wide range of flow conditions simply by knowing the
rheology of the bulk continuous phase. Experimental results are complemented
with numerical simulations of purely shear thinning fluids using Lattice
Boltzmann models. The good agreement between the experimental and numerical

as obtained from ab initio calculations. We identify the preferable magnetic
order by means of density functional theory plus Hubbard U calculations and
extract the effective exchange parameters (Jij's) using the magnetic force
theorem. We find that the effects of geometrical relaxation at the surface as
well as the change of crystal field are very strong and are able to influence
the lower energy magnetic configuration. In particular, our analysis reveals
that the exchange interaction between the Mn atoms belonging to the surface and
the subsurface layers is very sensitive to the structural changes. An earlier
study [A. Filippetti and W.E. Pickett, Phys. Rev. Lett. 83, 4184 (1999)]
suggested that this coupling is ferromagnetic and gives rise to the spin flip
process on the surface of CMO. In our work we confirm their finding for an
unrelaxed geometry, but once the structural relaxations are taken into account,
this exchange coupling changes its sign. Thus, we suggest that the surface of
CMO should have the same G-type antiferromagnetic order as in the bulk.
Finally, we show that the suggested SF can be induced in the system by
introducing an excess of electrons.

self-gravitating circumbinary discs around binaries whose parameters match
those of the circumbinary planet-hosting systems Kepler-16, -34 and -35.
Previous work has shown that non-self-gravitating discs in these systems form
an eccentric precessing inner cavity due to tidal truncation by the binary, and
planets which form at large radii migrate until stalling at this cavity. While
this scenario appears to provide a natural explanation for the observed orbital
locations of the circumbinary planets, previous simulations have failed to
match the observed planet orbital parameters. The aim of this work is to
examine the role of self-gravity in modifying circumbinary disc structure as a
function of disc mass, prior to considering the evolution of embedded
circumbinary planets. In agreement with previous work, we find that for disc
masses between 1--5 times the minimum mass solar nebula (MMSN), disc
self-gravity affects modest changes in the structure and evolution of
circumbinary discs. Increasing the disc mass to 10 or 20 MMSN leads to two
dramatic changes in disc structure. First, the scale of the inner cavity
shrinks substantially, bringing its outer edge closer to the binary. Second, in
addition to the eccentric inner cavity, additional precessing eccentric
ring-like features develop in the outer regions of the discs. If planet
formation starts early in the disc lifetime, these changes will have a
significant impact on the formation and evolution of planets and precursor
material.

the vicinity of the event horizon, applying the pulsar outer-gap model to black
hole magnetospheres. During a low accretion phase, the radiatively inefficient
accretion flow (RIAF) cannot emit enough MeV photons that are needed to sustain
the force-free magnetosphere via two-photon collisions. In such a
charge-starved region (or a gap), an electric field arises along the magnetic
field lines to accelerate electrons and positrons into ultra-relativistic
energies. These relativistic leptons emit copious gamma-rays via curvature and
inverse-Compton (IC) processes. Some of such gamma-rays collide with the
submillimeter-IR photons emitted from the RIAF to materialize as pairs, which
polarize to partially screen the original acceleration electric field. It is
found that the gap gamma-ray luminosity increases with decreasing accretion
rate. However, if the accretion rate decreases too much, the diminished RIAF
soft photon field can no longer sustain a stationary pair production within the
gap. As long as a stationary gap is formed, the magnetosphere becomes
force-free outside the gap by the cascaded pairs, irrespective of the BH mass.
If a nearby stellar-mass black hole (BH) is in quiescence, or if a galactic
intermediate-mass BH is in a very low accretion state, its curvature and IC
emissions are found to be detectable with Fermi/LAT and imaging atmospheric
Cherenkov telescopes (IACT). If a low-luminosity active galactic nucleus is
located within a few tens of Mpc, the IC emission from its super-massive BH is
marginally detectable with IACT.

dwarf galaxy VCC 1661. The extant literature lists a broad range of radii for
this object, covering a factor of more than four, depending on the filters used
and the details of the analyses. While some studies find a radius typical of
other Virgo dwarfs and note the normality of this object, any larger spatial
extent, taken at face value, would render this galaxy the largest dwarf in the
Virgo Cluster samples. Confirmation of a large extent of dwarf galaxies has
often led to the discovery of tidal tails and would then, also in VCC 1661,
indicate a severe state of tidal disruption. Given the importance of galactic
sizes for assessing tidal interactions of the satellites with their hosts, we
thus combine our surface brightness profile with data from the literature to
investigate further the nature of this galaxy. However, our new characteristic
radius for VCC 1661 of $r_e=24.1$""$\pm7.7$"" and the previously noted smooth
appearance of its isophotes are fully consistent with the remainder of the
ACSVCS dwarf galaxy population without any need to invoke tidal perturbations.

studied by various statistical tests in previous years. It has been suggested
that there was a distinct group of GRBs, beyond the long and short ones, with
intermediate durations. However, such a group is not securely confirmed yet.
Strangely, concerning the spectral hardness, the observations from the Swift
and RHESSI satellites give different results. For the Swift/BAT database it is
found that the intermediate-duration bursts might well be related to so-called
X-ray flashes (XRFs). On the other hand, for the RHESSI dataset the
intermediate-duration bursts seem to be spectrally too hard to be given by
XRFs. The connection of the intermediate-duration bursts and XRFs for the BATSE

relation between XRFs and GRBs for the BATSE and RHESSI databases,
respectively. We use an empirical definition of XRFs introduced by other
authors earlier. For the RHESSI database we also use a transformation between
the detected counts and the fluences based on the simulated detector response
function. The purpose is to compare the hardnesses of GRBs with the definition
of XRFs. There is a 1.3-4.2 % fraction of XRFs in the whole BATSE database. The
vast majority of the BATSE short bursts are not XRFs because only 0.7-5.7 % of
the short bursts can be given by XRFs. However, there is a large uncertainty in
the fraction of XRFs among the intermediate-duration bursts. The fraction of
1-85 % of the BATSE intermediate-duration bursts can be related to XRFs. For
the long bursts this fraction is between 1.0 % and 3.4 %. The uncertainties in
these fractions are large, however it can be claimed that all BATSE
intermediate-duration bursts cannot be given by XRFs. At least 79 % of RHESSI

assurance and protocol optimization. It is particularly important in the
presence of parallel imaging acceleration, where the noise distribution can
contain severe spatial heterogeneities. If the parallel imaging reconstruction
is a linear process, an exact noise analysis is possible by taking into account
the correlations between all the samples involved. However, for k-space based
techniques like GRAPPA, the exact analysis has been considered computationally
prohibitive due to the very large size of the noise covariance matrices
required to characterize the noise propagation from k-space to image-space.
Previous methods avoid this computational burden by approximating the GRAPPA
reconstruction as a pixel-wise linear operation performed in the image-space.
However, these methods are not exact in the presence of non-uniform k-space
undersampling (e.g.: containing a calibration region). For this reason, in this
work we develop an exact characterization of the noise distribution for
self-calibrated parallel imaging in the presence of arbitrary Cartesian
undersampling patterns. By exploiting the symmetries and separability in the
noise propagation process, the proposed method is computationally efficient and
does not require large matrices. In this manuscript, we present the proposed
noise characterization method and compare it to previous techniques using
Monte-Carlo simulations as well as phantom acquisitions.

subsequently decay to muons, using a novel superconducting solenoid magnet
system. After the pion-capture solenoid the first $36^\circ$ of the curved muon
transport line was commissioned and the muon flux was measured. In order to
detect muons, a target of either copper or magnesium was placed to stop muons
at the end of the muon beamline. Two stations of plastic scintillators located
upstream and downstream from the muon target were used to reconstruct the decay
spectrum of muons. In a complementary method to detect negatively-charged
muons, the X-ray spectrum yielded by muonic atoms in the target were measured
in a germanium detector. Measurements, at a proton beam current of 6 pA,
yielded $(10.4 \pm 2.7) \times 10^5$ muons per Watt of proton beam power

accreted. Previous models demonstrated that sequential freeze-out of O and
C-bearing volatiles in disks will result in an supersolar C/O ratios and
subsolar C/H ratios in the gas between water and CO snowlines. This result does
not take into account, however, the expected grain growth and radial drift of
pebbles in disks, and the accompanying re-distribution of volatiles from the
outer to the inner disk. Using a toy model we demonstrate that when drift is
considered, CO is enhanced between the water and CO snowline, resulting in both
supersolar C/O and C/H ratios in the disk gas in the Gas Giant formation zone.
This result appears robust to the details of the disk model as long as there is
substantial pebble drift across the CO snowline, and the efficiency of CO vapor
diffusion is limited. Gas Giants that accrete their gaseous envelopes exterior
to the water snowline and do not experience substantial core-envelope mixing,
may thus present both superstellar C/O and C/H ratios in their atmospheres.
Pebble drift will also affect the nitrogen and noble gas abundances in the

Optimal Power Flow (OPF) to analyse the worst-case forecasts for the load and

The optimized controls use only local measurements to address system-wide

proposed methodology is tested on the Cigre LV benchmark grid confirming that
it is successful in mitigating with acceptable violations over- and
under-voltage problems, as well as congestion issues. Its performance is

  We consider two scenarios of precession. First, we assume that the precession
axis is perpendicular to the plane of the outer disc. In this scenario the
relative geometry of the cold disc and the hot torus does not change during
precession, so the emitted spectrum does not change, and the modulation is
solely due to the changing viewing angle. In the second scenario the precession
axis is tilted with respect to the outer disc plane. This leads to changes in
the relative geometry of the hot flow and cold plasma, possibly resulting in
variations of the plasma temperature and thus generating additional spectral
variability, which combines with the variations due to the viewing angle
changes.

the hydraulically induced shear stress at the crack faces. It utilizes a
general form of the elasticity operator alongside a revised fracture
propagation condition based on the critical value of the energy release rate.
It is shown that the revised formulation describes the underlying physics of HF
in a more accurate way and is in agreement with the asymptotic behaviour of the
linear elastic fracture mechanics. A number of numerical simulations by means
of the universal HF algorithm previously developed in Wrobel & Mishuris (2015)
are performed in order to: i) compare the modified HF formulation with its
classic counterpart and ii) investigate the peculiarities of the former.
Computational advantages of the revised HF model are demonstrated. Asymptotic
estimations of the main solution elements are provided for the cases of small
and large toughness. The modified formulation opens new ways to analyse the
physical phenomenon of HF and also improves the reliability and efficiency of
its numerical simulations.

development of a new generation of computational models integrating analytical
knowledge, data and experience about the complex dynamics occurring in

recent efforts. This paper presents the results of a significant data gathering
campaign realised at an unsignalized zebra crossing. The selected area of the
city of Milan (Italy) is characterised by a significant presence of elderly

number of accidents involving pedestrians in the past years. The results
concern the analysis of: (i) vehicular and pedestrian traffic volumes; (ii)
level of service; (iii) pedestrian-vehicle interactions, considering the impact
of ageing on crossing behaviour. Results showed that the phenomenon is
characterised by three main phases: approaching, appraising (evaluation of the
distance and speed of oncoming vehicles) and crossing. The final objective of
the research is to support the development of a microscopic agent-based tool
for simulating pedestrian behaviour at unsignalized crosswalks, focusing on the
specific needs of the elderly pedestrians.

discrete subgroups (DSG) of $U(3)$ and analytically work out the mixing
patterns implied by the assumption that $Z_2$ and $Z_m$ describe the residual
symmetries of the neutrino and the charged lepton mass matrices respectively.
Both $Z_2$ and $Z_m$ are assumed to be subgroups of a larger discrete symmetry
group $G_f$ possessing three dimensional faithful irreducible representation.
The residual symmetries predict the magnitude of a column of the leptonic
mixing matrix $U_{\rm PMNS}$ which are studied here assuming $G_f$ as the DSG
of $SU(3)$ designated as type C and D and large number of DSG of $U(3)$ which
are not in $SU(3)$. These include the known group series $\Sigma(3n^3)$,
$T_n(m)$, $\Delta(3n^2,m)$, $\Delta(6n^2,m)$ and $\Delta'(6n^2,j,k)$. It is
shown that the predictions for a column of $|U_{\rm PMNS}|$ in these group
series and the C and D types of groups are all contained in the predictions of
the $\Delta(6N^2)$ groups for some integer $N$. The $\Delta(6N^2)$ groups
therefore represent a sufficient set of $G_f$ to obtain predictions of the
residual symmetries $Z_2$ and $Z_m$.

surrounded by a protoplanetary disk of $\sim$ 900 AU in diameter, making it one
of the most extended Herbig Ae/Be disks as seen in the mid-IR. The star is
behind, or embedded in, the $\rho$ Ophiuchus molecular cloud, and obscured by
28 magnitudes of extinction at optical wavelengths by the foreground cloud.
Mid-IR polarization of WL 16, mainly arises from aligned elongated dust grains
present along the line of sight, suggesting a uniform morphology of
polarization vectors with an orientation of 33\degr (East from North) and a
polarization fraction of $\sim$ 2.0\%. This orientation is consistent with
previous polarimetric surveys in the optical and near-IR bands to probe
large-scale magnetic fields in the Ophiuchus star formation region, indicating
that the observed mid-IR polarization toward WL 16 is produced by the dichroic
absorption of magnetically aligned foreground dust grains by a uniform magnetic
field. Using polarizations of WL 16 and Elias 29, a nearby polarization
standard star, we constrain the polarization efficiency,
\textit{$p_{10.3}/A_{10.3}$}, for the dust grains in the $\rho$ Ophiuchus
molecular cloud to be $\sim$ 1.0\% mag$^{-1}$. WL 16 has polycyclic aromatic
hydrocarbon (PAH) emission features detected at 8.6, 11.2, 12.0, and 12.7
$\mu$m by our spectroscopic data, and we find an anti-correlation between the
PAH surface brightness and the PAH ionization fraction between the NW and SW

(resp. oddtown) if all its sets have even (resp. odd) size and all pairwise
intersections have even size. Using tools from linear algebra, it was shown by
Berlekamp and Graver that the maximum size of an eventown is $2^{\left\lfloor
n/2\right\rfloor}$. On the other hand (somewhat surprisingly), it was proven by
Berlekamp, that oddtowns have size at most $n$. Over the last four decades,
many extensions of this even/oddtown problem have been studied. In this paper
we present new results on two such extensions. First, extending a result of Vu,
we show that a $k$-wise eventown (i.e., intersections of $k$ sets are even) has
for $k \geq 3$ a unique extremal configuration and obtain a stability result
for this problem. Next we improve some known bounds for the defect version of
an $\ell$-oddtown problem. In this problem we consider sets of size $\not\equiv
0 \pmod \ell$ where $\ell$ is a prime number $\ell$ (not necessarily $2$) and
allow a few pairwise intersections to also have size $\not\equiv 0 \pmod \ell$.

abstract Tile Assembly Model, when restricted to use only noncooperative
bindings, any long enough path starting from the seed that can grow in all
terminal assemblies is pumpable, meaning that this path can be extended into an
infinite, ultimately periodic path. This result can be seen as a geometric
generalization of the pumping lemma of finite state automata, and closes the
question of what can be computed deterministically in this model. Moreover,
this question has motivated the development of a new method called visible
glues. We believe that this method can also be used to tackle other
long-standing problems in computational geometry, in relation for instance with
self-avoiding paths. Tile assembly (including non-cooperative tile assembly)
was originally introduced by Winfree and Rothemund in STOC 2000 to understand
how to program shapes. The non-cooperative variant, also known as temperature 1
tile assembly, is the model where tiles are allowed to bind as soon as they
match on one side, whereas in cooperative tile assembly, some tiles need to
match on several sides in order to bind. Previously, exactly one known result
(SODA 2014) showed a restriction on the assemblies general non-cooperative
self-assembly could achieve, without any implication on its computational
expressiveness. With non-square tiles (like polyominos, SODA 2015), other
recent works have shown that the model quickly becomes computationally
powerful.

Section Working Group in the period 2014-2016. The main goal of the working
group was to present the state-of-the-art of Higgs physics at the LHC,
integrating all new results that have appeared in the last few years. The first
part compiles the most up-to-date predictions of Higgs boson production cross
sections and decay branching ratios, parton distribution functions, and
off-shell Higgs boson production and interference effects. The second part
discusses the recent progress in Higgs effective field theory predictions,
followed by the third part on pseudo-observables, simplified template cross
section and fiducial cross section measurements, which give the baseline
framework for Higgs boson property measurements. The fourth part deals with the
beyond the Standard Model predictions of various benchmark scenarios of Minimal
Supersymmetric Standard Model, extended scalar sector, Next-to-Minimal
Supersymmetric Standard Model and exotic Higgs boson decays. This report
follows three previous working-group reports: Handbook of LHC Higgs Cross
Sections: 1. Inclusive Observables (CERN-2011-002), Handbook of LHC Higgs Cross
Sections: 2. Differential Distributions (CERN-2012-002), and Handbook of LHC
Higgs Cross Sections: 3. Higgs properties (CERN-2013-004). The current report
serves as the baseline reference for Higgs physics in LHC Run 2 and beyond.

this from a different perspective, considering a single automorphism (and

Lagrangian describing the dynamics of compact binary systems at the fourth
post-Newtonian (4PN) order in harmonic coordinates. We clarify the impact of
the non-local character of the Fokker Lagrangian or the associated Hamiltonian
on both the conserved energy and the relativistic periastron precession for
circular orbits. We show that the non-locality of the action, due to the
presence of the tail effect at the 4PN order, gives rise to an extra
contribution to the conserved integral of energy with respect to the
Hamiltonian computed on shell, which was not taken into account in our previous
work. We also provide a direct derivation of the periastron advance by taking
carefully into account this non-locality. We then argue that the infra-red (IR)
divergences in the calculation of the gravitational part of the action are
problematic, which motivates us to introduce a second ambiguity parameter, in
addition to the one already assumed previously. After fixing these two
ambiguity parameters by requiring that the conserved energy and the
relativistic periastron precession for circular orbits are in agreement with
numerical and analytical gravitational self-force calculations, valid in the
limiting case of small mass ratio, we find that our resulting Lagrangian is
physically equivalent to the one obtained in the ADM Hamiltonian approach.

on mobile devices using historical location traces of the user as a function of

Hidden Markov Model (HMM)-based solution is proposed. The proposed method,
namely the Marginally Smoothed HMM (MSHMM), utilizes the marginal probabilities
of location and timing information of the observations to smooth-out the
emission probabilities while training. Hence, it can efficiently handle
unforeseen observations during the test phase. The verification performance of
this method is compared to a sequence matching (SM) method , a Markov
Chain-based method (MC) and an HMM with basic Laplace Smoothing (HMM-lap).
Experimental results using the location information of the UMD Active

proposed MSHMM method outperforms the compared methods in terms of equal error

just propagating disturbances in the gravitational field of extremely strong
sources caused by some catastrophic event associated with cosmic bodies, like
binary black hole coalescence, or neutron star mergers. As these events happen
very far away in cosmos, and the signal strength would be extremely weak, it
requires extraordinary detection and analysis technology to observe an event on
earth. Luckily the joint collaboration LIGO-VIRGO, have so far detected two
events in September and December of 2015 during their analysis of observations
made with the laser interferometers over the last few observing sessions. The
talk will give a brief theoretical sketch of the analysis required for
describing the waves resulting from mass motion in the realm of general
relativity, and point out, the serious and sincere efforts of the past fifty
years that went into the final success. An attempt will be made to point out
the enormous scope that is available for the new generation of students and
researchers in pursuing the topic as a new window for possibly viewing the
Universe with the implications for the studies of Dark matter, Dark energy and
Cosmology as a whole.

features a complex order parameter, which generates a rich variety of

parameter makes it difficult to treat topological excitations and topological
influence systematically. To overcome this problem, we develop a general method
to calculate homotopy groups and derive decomposition formulas which express
homotopy groups of the order parameter manifold $G/H$ in terms of those of the
symmetry $G$ of a system and those of the remaining symmetry $H$ of the state.
By applying these formulas to general monopoles and three-dimensional
skyrmions, we show that their textures are obtained through substitution of the
corresponding $\mathfrak{su}(2)$-subalgebra for the $\mathfrak{su}(2)$-spin. We
also show that a discrete symmetry of $H$ is necessary for the presence of
topological influence and find topological influence on a skyrmion
characterized by a non-Abelian permutation group of three elements in the
ground state of an SU(3)-Heisenberg model.

rays. The computations have been done using the GEANT-4 Planetocosmics
Monte-Carlo tool and a realistic curved atmospheric model. For the first time,
an effect of the geometrical correction of the neutron monitor effective area,
related to the finite lateral expansion of the cosmic ray induced atmospheric
cascade, is considered, that was neglected in the previous studies. This
correction slightly enhances the relative impact of higher-energy cosmic rays
(energy above 5--10 GeV/nucleon) in neutron monitor count rate. The new
computation finally resolves the long-standing problem of disagreement between
the theoretically calculated spatial variability of cosmic rays over the globe
and experimental latitude surveys. The newly calculated yield function,
corrected for this geometrical factor, appears fully consistent with the
experimental latitude surveys of neutron monitors performed during three
consecutive solar minima in 1976--77, 1986--87 and 1996--97. Thus, we provide a
new yield function of the standard sea-level neutron monitor 6NM64 that is
validated against experimental data.

predistribution scheme under an on/off channel model. The heterogeneous random
key predistribution scheme considers the case when the network includes sensor
nodes with varying levels of resources, features, or connectivity requirements;
e.g., regular nodes vs. cluster heads, but does not incorporate the fact that
wireless channel are unreliable. To capture the unreliability of the wireless
medium, we use an on/off channel model; wherein, each wireless channel is
either on (with probability $\alpha$) or off (with probability $1-\alpha$)
independently. We present conditions (in the form of zero-one laws) on how to
scale the parameters of the network model so that with high probability the
network is $k$-connected, i.e., the network remains connected even if any $k-1$
nodes fail or leave the network. We also present numerical results to support
these conditions in the finite-node regime.

  pollution rebound effect, and empirical evidence from road transport sector",,,,,"q-fin.EC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The air pollution has become a serious challenge in China. Emissions from
motor vehicles have been found as one main source of air pollution. Although
the Chinese government has taken numerous policies to mitigate the harmful
emissions from road transport sector, it is still uncertain for both policy
makers and researchers to know to what extent the policies are effective in the
short and long terms. Inspired by the concept and empirical results from
current literature on energy rebound effect (ERE), we first propose a new
concept of pollution rebound effect (PRE). Then, we estimate direct air PRE as
a measure for the effectiveness of the policies of reducing air pollution from
transport sector based on time-series data from the period 1986-2014. We find
that the short-term direct air PRE is -1.4105, and the corresponding long-run
PRE is -1.246. The negative results indicate that the direct air PRE does not
exist in road passenger transport sector in China, either in the short term or
in the long term during the period 1986-2014. This implies that the Chinese
transport policies are effective in terms of harmful emissions reduction in the
transport sector. This research, to the best of our knowledge, is the first
attempt to quantify the effectiveness of the transport policies in the
transitional China.

  operational perspective",,,,,"q-fin.EC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  There is an increasing awareness of the significance of Chinese building
energy consumption(BEC). However, something worth discussing is that estimate
the building energy consumption adopting the definition of life cycle or
operation. In the existing studies with various evaluation methods, the issue
about the amount of energy consumed by China buildings has not been understood.
In order to settle the disputes over the calculation of BEC, this paper
establish an appropriate accounting method of building energy to present BEC
situation in China and lay the foundation for building energy efficiency.
Adopting the conception of building operational energy consumption, we find
that the energy consumption of buildings just accounts for 15% - 16% of the
final total energy consumption in China; by contrast, the previous calculations
usually have double accounting through top-down approach if central heat-supply
of buildings was given into additional consideration.

convergence, divergence or paralleled growth, multimodality and persistence are
the dominant characteristics in the distribution dynamics of Chinese
prefectural cities. Moreover, initial city size matters, initially small and
medium-sized cities exhibit strong tendency of convergence, while large cities
show significant persistence and multimodality in the sample period.
Examination on the regional city groups shows that locational fundamentals have
important impact on the distribution dynamics of city size.

  Chinese provinces: A weighted Approach",,,,,"q-fin.EC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  This paper examines the distribution dynamics of carbon dioxide (CO2)
emission intensity across 30 Chinese provinces using a weighted distribution
dynamics approach. The results show that CO2 emission intensity tends to
diverge during the sample period of 1995-2014. However, convergence clubs are
found in the ergodic distributions of the full sample and two sub-sample
periods. Divergence, polarization and stratification are the dominant
characteristics in the distribution dynamics. Weightings with economic and
population sizes have important impacts on current distributions and hence long
run steady distributions. Neglecting economic size may under-estimate the
deterioration in the long run steady state. The result also shows that
conditioning on space and income cannot eliminate the multimodality in the long
run distribution. However, capital intensity has important impact on the
formation of convergence clubs. Our findings have contributions in the
understanding of the spatial dynamic behaviours of CO2 emissions across Chinese
provinces, and have important policy implications for CO2 emissions reduction
in China.
