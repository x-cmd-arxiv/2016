become a topic of research since they could be the link between standard
collimated jets and CMEs.}
  Aim: Our aim is to understand the origin of a series of broad jets, some
accompanied by flares and associated with narrow and jet-like CMEs.
  Methods: We analyze observations of a series of recurrent broad jets observed
in AR 10484 on 21-24 October 2003. In particular, one of them occurred
simultaneously with an M2.4 flare on 23 October at 02:41 UT (SOLA2003-10-23).
Both events were observed by ARIES H-alpha Solar Tower-Telescope, TRACE, SOHO,
and RHESSI instruments. The flare was very impulsive and followed by a narrow
CME. A local force-free model of AR 10484 is the basis to compute its topology.
We find bald patches (BPs) at the flare site. This BP topology is present for
at least two days before. Large-scale field lines, associated with the BPs,
represent open loops. This is confirmed by a global PFSS model. Following the
brightest leading edge of the H-alpha and EUV jet emission, we can temporarily
associate it with a narrow CME.
  Results: Considering their characteristics, the observed broad jets appear to
be of the blowout class. As the most plausible scenario, we propose that
magnetic reconnection could occur at the BP separatrices forced by the
destabilization of a continuously reformed flux rope underlying them. The
reconnection process could bring the cool flux-rope material into the
reconnected open field lines driving the series of recurrent blowout jets and
accompanying CMEs.
  Conclusions: Based on a model of the coronal field, we compute the AR 10484
topology at the location where flaring and blowout jets occurred from 21 to 24
October 2003. This topology can consistently explain the origin of these
events.

of quantum computers, which achieves a large separation between quantum and
classical query complexities. However, Simon's discussion on his problem was
limited to bounded-error setting, which means his algorithm can not always get
the correct answer. Exact quantum algorithms for Simon's problem have also been
proposed, which deterministically solve the problem with O(n) queries. Also the
quantum lower bound \Omega(n) for Simon's problem is known. Although these
algorithms are either complicated or specialized, their results give an O(n)
versus \Omega(\sqrt{2^{n}}) separation in exact query complexities for Simon's
problem (\Omega(\sqrt{2^{n}}) is the lower bound for classical probabilistic
algorithms), but it has not been proved whether this separation is optimal. In
this paper, we propose another exact quantum algorithm for solving Simon's
problem with O(n) queries, which is simple, concrete and does not rely on
special query oracles. Our algorithm combines Simon's algorithm with the
quantum amplitude amplification technique to ensure its determinism. In
particular, we show that Simon's problem can be solved by a classical
deterministic algorithm with O(\sqrt{2^{n}}) queries (as we are aware, there
were no classical deterministic algorithms for solving Simon's problem with
O(\sqrt{2^{n}}) queries). Combining some previous results, we obtain the
optimal separation in exact query complexities for Simon's problem: \Theta({n})

for regular-shaped dots, starting from the symmetry properties of the current
operator. We find that, where the x- and y-components of the current operator
transform with the same irreducible representation (irrep) of the point group -
for example in triangular or hexagonal GQD's - the optical conductivity is
independent of the polarisation of the light. On the other hand, where these
components transform with different irreps - for example in rectangular GQD's -
the optical conductivity depends on the polarisation of light. We find that
GQD's with non-commuting point-group operations - for example dots of
rectangular shape - can be distinguished from GQD's with commuting point-group
operations - for example dots of triangular or hexagonal shape - by using
polarized light. We carry out explicit calculations of the optical conductivity
of GQD's described by a simple tight--binding model and, for dots of
intermediate size, \textcolor{blue}{($10 \lesssim L \lesssim 50\ \text{nm}$)}
find an absorption peak in the low--frequency range of the spectrum which
allows us to distinguish between dots with zigzag and armchair edges. We also
clarify the one-dimensional nature of states at the van Hove singularity in
graphene, providing a possible explanation for very high exciton-binding

  Lopsided Lovasz Local Lemma",,,,,"math.PR cs.DM math.CO","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The Lopsided Lovasz Local Lemma (LLLL) is a cornerstone probabilistic tool
for showing that it is possible to avoid a collection of ""bad"" events as long
as their probabilities and interdependencies are sufficiently small. The
strongest possible criterion in these terms is due to Shearer (1985), although
it is technically difficult to apply to constructions in combinatorics.
  The original formulation of the LLLL was non-constructive; a seminal
algorithm of Moser & Tardos (2010) gave an efficient algorithm for nearly all
its applications, including to $k$-SAT instances where each variable appears in
a bounded number of clauses. Harris (2015) later gave an alternate criterion
for this algorithm to converge; unlike the LLL criterion or its variants, this
criterion depends in a fundamental way on the decomposition of bad-events into
variables.
  In this note, we show that the criterion given by Harris can be stronger in
some cases even than Shearer's criterion. We construct $k$-SAT formulas with
bounded variable occurrence, and show that the criterion of Harris is satisfied
while the criterion of Shearer is violated. In fact, there is an exponentially
growing gap between the bounds provable from any form of the LLLL and from the
bound shown by Harris.

source of Teff 4290+-760 K and radius 1490+-540 Rsun located close to both the
Hayashi and Eddington limits; this source is consistent with a 40 Msun
evolutionary track without rotation and current mass 27-36 Msun. It exhibits
NaI in emission arising from a shell of radius 1.5 Rphot and a photocenter
displacement of about 0.1 Rphot. V766 Cen shows strong extended molecular (CO)
layers and a dusty circumstellar background component. This suggest an
optically thick pseudo-photosphere at about 1.5 Rphot at the onset of the wind.
V766 Cen is a red supergiant located close to the Hayashi limit instead of a
yellow hypergiant already evolving back toward warmer Teff as previously
discussed.
  The stars sigma Oph, BM Sco, and HD 206859 are found to have lower
luminosities of about log(L/Lsun)=3.4-3.5 and Teff of 3900-5300 K,
corresponding to 5-9 Msun tracks. They do not show extended molecular layers as
observed for higher luminosity red supergiants of our sample. BM Sco shows an
unusually strong contribution by an over-resolved circumstellar dust component.
These stars are more likely high-mass red giants instead of red supergiants.
  This leaves us with an unsampled locus in the HR diagram corresponding to
luminosities log(L/Lsun)~3.8-4.8 or masses 10-13 Msun, possibly corresponding
to the mass region where stars explode as type II-P supernovae during the RSG
stage.
  Our previously found relation of increasing strength of extended molecular
layers with increasing luminosities is now confirmed to extend to double our
previous luminosities and up to the Eddington limit. This might further point
to steadily increasing radiative winds with increasing luminosity.

machine learning tasks, ranging from improved speech recognition systems to
advancing the development of autonomous vehicles. However, despite their
superior performance in many applications, these models have been recently
shown to be susceptible to a particular type of attack possible through the
generation of particular synthetic examples referred to as adversarial samples.
These samples are constructed by manipulating real examples from the training
data distribution in order to ""fool"" the original neural model, resulting in
misclassification (with high confidence) of previously correctly classified
samples. Addressing this weakness is of utmost importance if deep neural
architectures are to be applied to critical applications, such as those in the
domain of cybersecurity. In this paper, we present an analysis of this
fundamental flaw lurking in all neural architectures to uncover limitations of
previously proposed defense mechanisms. More importantly, we present a unifying
framework for protecting deep neural models using a non-invertible data

linear and nonlinear dimensionality reduction. Empirical results indicate that

Hidden-state CRF (HCRF) and Latent-Dynamic CRF (LDCRF); and Conditional Neural

first dataset is an open (public) polysomnographic dataset downloadable from
the Internet, while the second dataset is our polysomnographic dataset (also
available for download). For the first dataset, the combination of FCM and CNF
gives the highest accuracy (96.75\%) with relatively short training time (0.33
hours). For the second dataset, the combination of DBN and CRF gives the
accuracy of 99.96\% but with 1.02 hours training time, whereas the combination

explore the energy distribution of soft X-ray (SXR) emissions from the
quiescent Sun, active regions, and during solar flares, and to model the impact
on Earth's ionosphere and thermosphere. The energy emitted in the SXR range
(0.1 --10 keV) can vary by more than a factor of 100, yet we have limited
spectral measurements in the SXRs to accurately quantify the spectral
dependence of this variability. The MinXSS primary science instrument is an
Amptek, Inc. X123 X-ray spectrometer that has an energy range of 0.5--30 keV
with a nominal 0.15 keV energy resolution. Two flight models have been built.
The first, MinXSS-1, has been making science observations since 2016 June 9,
and has observed numerous flares, including more than 40 C-class and 7 M-class
flares. These SXR spectral measurements have advantages over broadband SXR
observations, such as providing the capability to derive multiple-temperature
components and elemental abundances of coronal plasma, improved irradiance
accuracy, and higher resolution spectral irradiance as input to planetary
ionosphere simulations. MinXSS spectra obtained during the M5.0 flare on 2016
July 23 highlight these advantages, and indicate how the elemental abundance
appears to change from primarily coronal to more photospheric during the flare.
MinXSS-1 observations are compared to the Geostationary Operational
Environmental Satellite (GOES) X-Ray Sensor (XRS) measurements of SXR
irradiance and estimated corona temperature. Additionally, a suggested
improvement to the calibration of the GOES XRS data is presented.

process such that each vertex has only one outgoing edge. The paper focuses on
the absence of percolation for such graphs. Our main result is based on two
assumptions. The Shield assumption ensures that the graph is locally determined
with possible random horizons. The Loop assumption ensures that any forward
branch of the graph merges on a loop provided that the Poisson point process is
augmented with a finite collection of well-chosen points. Several models
satisfy these general assumptions and inherit in consequence the absence of
percolation. In particular, we solve a conjecture by Daley et al. on the
absence of percolation for the line-segment model. In this planar model, a
segment is growing from any point of the Poisson process and stops its growth
whenever it hits another segment. The random directions are picked
independently and uniformly on the unit sphere. Another model of geometric
navigation is presented and also fulfills the Shield and Loop assumptions.

quantum systems computed using the Schwinger-Keldysh formalism obey a set of
Ward identities. These can be understood rather simply as the consequence of a
topological (BRST) algebra, called the universal Schwinger-Keldysh
superalgebra, as explained in our companion paper arXiv:1610.01940. In the
present paper we provide a mathematical discussion of this topological algebra.
In particular, we argue that the structures can be understood in the language
of extended equivariant cohomology. To keep the discussion self-contained, we
provide a basic review of the algebraic construction of equivariant cohomology
and explain how it can be understood in familiar terms as a superspace gauge
algebra. We demonstrate how the Schwinger-Keldysh construction can be
succinctly encoded in terms a thermal equivariant cohomology algebra which
naturally acts on the operator (super)-algebra of the quantum system. The main
rationale behind this exploration is to extract symmetry statements which are
robust under renormalization group flow and can hence be used to understand
low-energy effective field theory of near-thermal physics. To illustrate the
general principles, we focus on Langevin dynamics of a Brownian particle,
rephrasing some known results in terms of thermal equivariant cohomology. As
described elsewhere, the general framework enables construction of effective
actions for dissipative hydrodynamics and could potentially illumine our
understanding of black holes.

propose a novel method based on supervised machine learning to approximate the

of the inverse problem are statistically distributed in a concentrated manner

the surprising facts is that the number of previously observed examples for the

with the dimension of the solution subspace. We also provide explicit error
bounds on the accuracy of the approximated parameter and the corresponding

higher-dimensional spherically symmetric dilaton black hole and the
Dirac-Goto-Nambu brane were investigated. The studies were conducted for three
values of the dilaton coupling constant, describing the uncoupled case, the
low-energy limit of the string theory and dimensionally reduced Klein-Kaluza
theories. When the black hole is nonextremal, two types of static
configurations are observed, a brane which intersects the black hole horizon
and a brane not having any common points with the accompanying black hole. As
the number of spacetime dimensions increases, the brane bend in the vicinity of
the black hole disappears closer to its horizon. Dynamical evolution of the
system results in an expulsion of the black hole from the brane. It proceeds
faster for bigger values of the bulk spacetime dimension and thicker branes.
The value of the dilatonic coupling constant does not influence neither the
static configurations nor the dynamical behavior of the examined nonextremal
system. In the extremal dilaton black hole case one obtains expulsion of the
brane which is independent on the spacetime dimensionality and the value of the
coupling constant. Dynamical studies of the configurations in the extremal case
reveal that the course of evolution of the system is similar to the nonextremal
one, except for a slightly earlier expulsion of the black hole from the brane.

k-truss, and nucleus decomposition) have been effective to locate many dense

been mostly overlooked. Keeping track of connected components during peeling
requires an additional traversal operation, which is as expensive as the
peeling process. In this paper, we start with a thorough survey and point to
nuances in problem formulations that lead to significant differences in
runtimes. We then propose efficient and generic algorithms to construct the
hierarchy of dense subgraphs for k-core, k-truss, or any nucleus decomposition.
Our algorithms leverage the disjoint-set forest data structure to efficiently
construct the hierarchy during traversal. Furthermore, we introduce a new idea

the peeling process, and build the relations to previously constructed
subgraphs. We also consider an existing idea to find the k-core hierarchy and

generating) domains on a per-domain basis which provides a simple and flexible
means to detect known DGA families. Recent machine learning approaches to DGA
detection have been successful on fairly simplistic DGAs, many of which produce
names of fixed length. However, models trained on limited datasets are somewhat
blind to new DGA variants.
  In this paper, we leverage the concept of generative adversarial networks to
construct a deep learning based DGA that is designed to intentionally bypass a
deep learning based detector. In a series of adversarial rounds, the generator
learns to generate domain names that are increasingly more difficult to detect.
In turn, a detector model updates its parameters to compensate for the
adversarially generated domains. We test the hypothesis of whether
adversarially generated domains may be used to augment training sets in order
to harden other machine learning models against yet-to-be-observed DGAs. We
detail solutions to several challenges in training this character-based

architecture begins as a domain name auto-encoder (encoder + decoder) trained
on domains in the Alexa one million. Then the encoder and decoder are
reassembled competitively in a generative adversarial network (detector +

constantly replenishes the vortex, preventing it from being fully destroyed. We
produce synthetic dust emission images using our simulation results. We find
that multiple small clumps of dust may be distributed azimuthally. These

studied. In particular, a noncooperative game is formulated between wearable
communication pairs that engage in D2D communications. In this game, wearable
devices acting as transmitters autonomously select the directions of their
beams so as to maximize the data rate to their receivers. To solve the game, an
algorithm based on best response dynamics is proposed that allows the
transmitters to reach a Nash equilibrium in a distributed manner. To further
improve the performance of mmW D2D communications, a novel quantum game model
is formulated to enable the wearable devices to exploit new quantum directions
during their beam alignment so as to further enhance their data rate.
Simulation results show that the proposed game-theoretic approach improves the
performance, in terms of data rate, of about 75% compared to a uniform beam
alignment. The results also show that the quantum game model can further yield
up to 20% improvement in data rates, relative to the classical game approach.

are playing a prominent role when dealing with real-world applications such as
Robotics. However, when confronted to non-stationary environments, these
methods crucially rely on an exploration-exploitation trade-off which is rarely
dynamically and automatically adjusted to changes in the environment. Here we
propose an active exploration algorithm for RL in structured (parameterized)
continuous action space. This framework deals with a set of discrete actions,
each of which is parameterized with continuous variables. Discrete exploration
is controlled through a Boltzmann softmax function with an inverse temperature
$\beta$ parameter. In parallel, a Gaussian exploration is applied to the
continuous action parameters. We apply a meta-learning algorithm based on the
comparison between variations of short-term and long-term reward running
averages to simultaneously tune $\beta$ and the width of the Gaussian
distribution from which continuous action parameters are drawn. When applied to
a simple virtual human-robot interaction task, we show that this algorithm
outperforms continuous parameterized RL both without active exploration and
with active exploration based on uncertainty variations measured by a
Kalman-Q-learning algorithm.

detail, given a network utility maximization problem parameterized by a maximum

achieved by the solution. Among many interesting properties, we prove that
these functions are continuous and monotonic. In addition, we derive bounds
revealing that the solutions to utility maximization problems are characterized
by a low and a high power regime. In the low power regime, the energy
efficiency of the solution can decrease slowly as the power budget increases,
and the network utility grows linearly at best. In contrast, in the high power
regime, the energy efficiency typically scales as $\Theta(1/\bar{p})$ as
$\bar{p}\to\infty$, and the network utility scales as $\Theta(1)$. We apply the
theoretical findings to a novel weighted rate maximization problem involving
the joint optimization of the uplink power and the base station assignment.

beyond mass such as halo concentration, a phenomenon referred to as halo
assembly bias. Standard halo occupation models (HOD) in large scale structure
studies assume that halo mass alone is sufficient in characterizing the
connection between galaxies and halos. Modeling of galaxy clustering can face
systematic effects if the number of galaxies within a halo is correlated with
other halo properties. Using the Small MultiDark-Planck high resolution
$N$-body simulation and the clustering measurements of the Sloan Digital Sky
Survey (SDSS) DR7 main galaxy sample, we investigate the extent to which the
concentration-dependence of halo occupation can be constrained. Furthermore, we
study how allowing for the concentration dependence can improve our modeling of
galaxy clustering.
  Our constraints on HOD with assembly bias suggest that satellite population
is not correlated with halo concentration at fixed halo mass. At fixed halo
mass, our constraints favor lack of correlation between the occupation of
centrals and halo concentration in the most luminous samples ($M_{\rm
r}<-21.5,-21$), and modest correlation in the $M_{\rm r}<-20.5,-20, -19.5$
samples. We show that in comparison with abundance-matching mock catalogs, our
findings suggest qualitatively similar but modest levels of the impact of halo
assembly bias on galaxy clustering. The effect is only present in the central
occupation and becomes less significant in brighter galaxy samples.
Furthermore, by performing model comparison based on information criteria, we
find that in most cases, the standard mass-only HOD model is still favored by
the observations.

an explanation for the evolution of cooperation. While the majority of previous
studies equates reputation with a transparent and complete history of players'
past decisions, in real life, reputations are often ambiguous and opaque. Using
web-based experiments, we explore the extent to which opaque reputation works
in isolating defectors, with and without partner selection opportunities. Our
results show that low reputation works as a signal of untrustworthiness,
whereas medium or high reputation are not taken into account by participants
for orienting their choices. We also find that reputation without partner
selection does not promote cooperative behavior; that is, defectors do not turn
into cooperators only for the sake of getting a positive reputation. Finally,
in a third study, we find that, when reputation is pivotal to selection, then a
substantial proportion of would-be-defectors turn into cooperators. Taken
together, these results provide insights on the characteristics of reputation
and on the way in which humans make use of it when selecting partners but also
when knowing that they will be selected.

entanglement transformation and the analogous classical task of secrecy
manipulation. Specifically we address whether bipartite mixed entanglement can
always be converted into pure entanglement or whether unsecure classical
correlations can always be transformed into secret shared randomness using
local operations and a bounded number of communication exchanges. Our main
contribution in this paper is an explicit construction of quantum and classical
state transformations which, for any given $r$, can be achieved using $r$
rounds of classical communication exchanges but no fewer. Our results reveal
that highly complex communication protocols are indeed necessary to fully
harness the information-theoretic resources contained in general quantum and

proving lower bounds for the required number of communication exchanges using
the notion of common information and various lemmas built upon it. We propose a

condensates are an exemplar for studying fundamental non-local nonlinear

of the soliton is strongly dependent on the atomic interactions, in stark
contrast to the non-dipolar case. The failure of a particle analogy, so
successful for dark solitons in general, to account for this behaviour implies
that these structures are inherently extended and non-particle-like. These
highly-sensitive waves may act as mesoscopic probes of the underlying quantum

tools for translating from one human language to another. Statistical machine
translation (SMT) is the dominant paradigm in this field. In SMT, translations
are generated by means of statistical models whose parameters are learned from
bilingual data. Scalability is a key concern in SMT, as one would like to make
use of as much data as possible to train better translation systems.
  In recent years, mobile devices with adequate computing power have become
widely available. Despite being very successful, mobile applications relying on
NLP systems continue to follow a client-server architecture, which is of
limited use because access to internet is often limited and expensive. The goal
of this dissertation is to show how to construct a scalable machine translation
system that can operate with the limited resources available on a mobile
device.
  The main challenge for porting translation systems on mobile devices is
memory usage. The amount of memory available on a mobile device is far less
than what is typically available on the server side of a client-server
application. In this thesis, we investigate alternatives for the two components
which prevent standard translation systems from working on mobile devices due
to high memory usage. We show that once these standard components are replaced
with our proposed alternatives, we obtain a scalable translation system that
can work on a device with limited memory.

materials science with accelerated materials discovery efforts often hampered
by challenges in interpreting combinatorial x-ray diffraction datasets, which
we address by developing AgileFD, an artificial intelligence algorithm that
enables rapid phase mapping from a combinatorial library of x-ray diffraction
patterns. AgileFD models alloying-based peak shifting through a novel expansion
of convolutional nonnegative matrix factorization, which not only improves the
identification of constituent phases but also maps their concentration and
lattice parameter as a function of composition. By incorporating Gibbs phase
rule into the algorithm, physically meaningful phase maps are obtained with
unsupervised operation, and more refined solutions are attained by injecting
expert knowledge of the system. The algorithm is demonstrated through
investigation of the V-Mn-Nb oxide system where decomposition of eight oxide
phases, including two with substantial alloying, provides the first phase map
for this pseudo-ternary system. This phase map enables interpretation of
high-throughput band gap data, leading to the discovery of new solar light
absorbers and the alloying-based tuning of the direct-allowed band-gap energy
of MnV2O6. The open-source family of AgileFD algorithms can be implemented into
a broad range of high throughput workflows to accelerate materials discovery.

cannot content themselves with average trends, but need to correctly take into
account intrinsic uncertainties. The space-time discreteness of the cosmic ray
sources, together with a substantial ignorance of their precise epochs and
locations (with the possible exception of the most recent and close ones) play
an important role in this sense. We elaborate a statistical theory to deal with
this problem, relating the composite probability P({\Psi}) to obtain a flux
{\Psi} at the Earth and the single-source probability p({\psi}) to contribute
with a flux {\psi}. The main difficulty arises from the fact that p({\psi}) is
a fat tail distribution, characterized by power-law or broken power-law
behavior up to very large fluxes for which central limit theorem does not hold,
and leading to well-known stable laws as opposed Gaussian. We find that
relatively simple recipes provide a satisfactory description of the probability
P({\Psi}). We also find that a naive Gaussian fit to simulation results would
underestimate the probability of very large fluxes, that is, several times
above the average, while overestimating the probability of relatively milder
excursions. At large energies, large flux fluctuations are prevented by causal
considerations, while at low energies a partial knowledge on the recent and
nearby population of sources plays an important role. A few proposal have been
discussed in the literature to account for spectral breaks recently reported in
cosmic ray data in terms of local contributions. We apply our newly developed
theory to assess their probabilities, finding that they are relatively small.

proposed Weyl semimetal candidates and a few experimental observations of a
Weyl semimetal in real materials. Through this experience, we have come to
appreciate that typical Weyl semimetals host many Weyl points. For instance,
the first Weyl semimetal observed in experiment, TaAs, hosts 24 Weyl points.
Similarly, the Mo$_x$W$_{1-x}$Te$_2$ series, recently under study as the first
Type II Weyl semimetal, has eight Weyl points. However, it is well-understood
that for a Weyl semimetal without inversion symmetry but with time-reversal
symmetry, the minimum number of Weyl points is four. Realizing such a minimal
Weyl semimetal is fundamentally relevant because it would offer the simplest
""hydrogen atom"" example of an inversion-breaking Weyl semimetal. At the same
time, transport experiments and device applications may be simpler in a system
with as few Weyl points as possible. Recently, TaIrTe$_4$ has been predicted to
be a minimal, inversion-breaking Weyl semimetal. However, crucially, the Weyl
points and Fermi arcs live entirely above the Fermi level, making them
inaccessible to conventional angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES).
Here we use pump-probe ARPES to directly access the band structure above the
Fermi level in TaIrTe$_4$. We directly observe Weyl points and topological
Fermi arcs, showing that TaIrTe$_4$ is a Weyl semimetal. We find that, in
total, TaIrTe$_4$ has four Weyl points, providing the first example of a
minimal inversion-breaking Weyl semimetal. Our results hold promise for
accessing exotic transport phenomena arising in Weyl semimetals in a real

problem of a reliable but efficient discretization of such variables. In
particular, the main question is how fast physical observables computed in the
discretized model converge toward the ones of the continuous model when the
number of states of the discretized model increases. We answer this question
for the XY model and its discretization, the $q$-state clock model, in the
mean-field setting provided by random graphs. It is found that the convergence
of physical observables is exponentially fast in the number $q$ of states of
the clock model, so allowing a very reliable approximation of the XY model by
using a rather small number of states. Furthermore, such an exponential
convergence is found to be independent from the disorder distribution used.
Only at $T=0$ the convergence is slightly slower (stretched exponential).
Thanks to the analytical solution to the $q$-state clock model, we compute
accurate phase diagrams in the temperature versus disorder strength plane. We
find that, at zero temperature, spontaneous replica symmetry breaking takes
place for any amount of disorder, even an infinitesimal one. We also study the
one step of replica symmetry breaking (1RSB) solution in the low-temperature
spin glass phase.

X-rays with $Hubble$ is largely anticorrelated, ranging between the levels of
1.4$-$3.5$\sigma$ for all the $Hubble$ and X-ray bands. This lack of

behavior of the non-linear integro-differential equation describing the soft
correlations of QCD jet measurements, the Banfi-Marchesini-Smye (BMS) equation.
This equation captures the late-time evolution of radiating color dipoles after
a hard collision. This allows us to prove that at large values of the control
variable (the non-global logarithm, a function of the infra-red energy scales
associated with distinct hard jets in an event), the distribution has a
gaussian tail. We compute the decay width analytically, giving a closed form
expression, and find it to be jet geometry independent, up to the number of
legs of the dipole in the active jet. Enabling the asymptotic expansion is the
correct perturbative seed, where we perturb around an anzats encoding formally
no real emissions, an intuition motivated by the buffer region found in jet
dynamics. This must be supplemented with the correct application of the BFKL
approximation to the BMS equation in collinear limits. Comparing to the
asymptotics of the conformally related evolution equation encountered in
small-x physics, the Balitisky-Kovchegov (BK) equation, we find that the
asymptotic form of the non-global logarithms directly maps to the black-disc
unitarity limit of the BK equation, despite the contrasting physical pictures.
Indeed, we recover the equations of saturation physics in the final state
dynamics of QCD.

obviously adversely affects the attainment of maximal entanglement, which we
study quantitatively and exactly. To quantify the effects of noise, we
calculate two-qubit coherence times and entanglement fidelity, both of which
can be extracted from simulations or measurements of the return probability as
a function of interaction time, i.e., the time period during which the exchange
coupling remains effective between the two spins. We perform these calculations
for a broad range of noise strengths that includes the regime of recent
experiments. We find that the two types of noise reduce the amount of
entanglement in qualitatively distinct ways and that, although charge noise
generally leads to faster decoherence, the relative importance of the two types
of noise in entanglement creation depends sensitively on the strength of the
exchange coupling. Our results can be used to determine the level of noise
suppression needed to reach quantum error correction thresholds. We provide
quantitative guidance for the requisite noise constraints necessary to

stellar population models of R\""ock et al., assuming a Kroupa IMF. We apply a
ratio based on each galaxy's mean mass-weighted stellar age within one
effective radius (the mass-to-light ratio is insensitive to galaxy metallicity
for the generally old stellar ages and high metallicities found in massive
early-type galaxies). Our 3.6$\mu$m stellar masses agree well with masses

CA-duality holographic, interpretation for the thermodynamic volume of an AdS
black hole. We go on to discuss the role of thermodynamics in complexity =
action for a number of black hole solutions, and then point out the possibility
of an alternate proposal, which we dub ""complexity = volume 2.0"". In this
alternate proposal, the complexity would be thought of as the spacetime volume
of the Wheeler-DeWitt patch. Finally, we provide evidence that, in certain
cases, our proposal for complexity is consistent with the Lloyd bound whereas
CA-duality is not.

conducted NIR microlensing surveys with UKIRT in conjunction with and in

were monitored with an hourly cadence by optical surveys but were not reported

embedded in a hot, tenuous galactic halo. If the magnetic field does not
increase too much inside the cloud, the local reduction in Alfv\'en speed
imposes a bottleneck on CRs streaming out from the star-forming galactic disk.
The bottleneck flattens the upstream CR gradient in the hot gas, implying that
multi-phase structure could have global effects on CR driven winds. A large CR
pressure gradient can also develop on the outward-facing edge of the cloud.
This pressure gradient has two independent effects. The CRs push the cloud
upward, imparting it with momentum. On smaller scales, the CRs pressurize cold
gas in the fronts, reducing its density, consistent with the low densities of
cold gas inferred in recent COS observations of local $L_{*}$ galaxies. They
also heat the material at the cloud edge, broadening the cloud-halo interface
and causing an observable change in interface ionic abundances. Due to the much
weaker temperature dependence of cosmic ray heating relative to thermal
conductive heating, CR mediated fronts have a higher ratio of low to high ions
compared to conduction fronts, in better agreement with observations. We
investigate these effects separately using 1D simulations and analytic
techniques.

considered agree nicely with the measured HI mass function in the local
Universe, with the measured scaling relations between HI and galaxy stellar
mass, and with the predicted 2-point correlation function for HI rich galaxies.
One exception is given by one model that predicts very little HI associated
with galaxies in haloes above 10^12 Msun: we argue this is due to a too
efficient radio-mode feedback for central galaxies, and to a combination of
efficient stellar feedback and instantaneous stripping of hot gas for
satellites. We demonstrate that treatment of satellite galaxies introduces
large uncertainties at low HI masses. While models assuming non instantaneous
stripping of hot gas tend to form satellite galaxies with HI masses slightly
smaller than those of centrals with the same stellar mass, instantaneous gas
stripping does not translate necessarily in lower HI masses. In fact, the
adopted stellar feedback and star formation affect the satellites too. We
analyze the relation between HI content and spin of simulated haloes: low spin
haloes tend to host HI poor galaxies while high spin haloes are populated by
galaxies in a wide range of HI mass. In our simulations, this is due to a
correlation between the initial gas disk size and the halo spin.

magneto-rotational instability is suppressed, the so-called dead zones, have
been suggested to explain gaps and asymmetries of transition disks. We
investigate the gas and dust evolution simultaneously assuming simplified
prescriptions for a dead zone and a magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) wind acting on
the disk. We explore whether the resulting gas and dust distribution can create
signatures similar to those observed in transition disks. For the dust
evolution, we included the transport, growth, and fragmentation of dust
particles. To compare with observations, we produced synthetic images in
scattered optical light and in thermal emission at mm wavelengths. In all
models with a dead zone, a bump in the gas surface density is produced that is
able to efficiently trap large particles ($\gtrsim 1$ mm) at the outer edge of
the dead zone. The gas bump reaches an amplitude of a factor of $\sim5$, which
can be enhanced by the presence of an MHD wind that removes mass from the inner
disk. While our 1D simulations suggest that such a structure can be present
only for $\sim$1 Myr, the structure may be maintained for a longer time when
more realistic 2D/3D simulations are performed. In the synthetic images,
gap-like low-emission regions are seen at scattered light and in thermal
emission at mm wavelengths, as previously predicted in the case of planet-disk
interaction. As a conclusion, main signatures of transition disks can be
reproduced by assuming a dead zone in the disk, such as gap-like structure in
scattered light and millimetre continuum emission, and a lower gas surface
density within the dead zone. Previous studies showed that the Rossby wave
instability can also develop at the edge of such dead zones, forming vortices
and also creating asymmetries.

halos, which affect the He II reionization history. In particular, we are able
to explore the impact that differences in the timing and duration of
reionization have on observables. We examine the thermal signature that
reionization leaves on the IGM, and measure the temperature-density relation.
As previous studies have shown, we confirm that the photoheating feedback from
helium II reionization raises the temperature of the IGM by several thousand
kelvin. To compare against observations, we generate synthetic Ly$\alpha$
forest sightlines on-the-fly and match the observed effective optical depth
$\tau_{\mathrm{eff}}(z)$ of hydrogen to recent observations. We show that when
the simulations have been normalized to have the same values of
$\tau_\mathrm{eff}$, the effect that helium II reionization has on observations
of the hydrogen Ly$\alpha$ forest is minimal. Specifically, the flux PDF and
the one-dimensional power spectrum are sensitive to the thermal state of the
IGM, but do not show direct evidence for the ionization state of helium. We
show that the peak temperature of the IGM typically corresponds to the time of
90%-95% helium ionization by volume, and is a relatively robust indicator of
the timing of reionization. Future observations of helium reionization from the
hydrogen Ly$\alpha$ forest should thus focus on measuring the temperature of
the IGM, especially at mean density. Detecting the peak in the IGM temperature
would provide valuable information about the timing of the end of helium II
reionization.

We present several empirical constraints that show why gas kinematics and radio
jets seem to be physically related. The gas kinetic energy from large scale
bulk and local outflow or turbulent motion corresponds to a few 10^-3 to 10^-2
of the kinetic energy of the jet. In galaxies with jet power >~10^47 erg s^-1,
the bulk kinetic energy dominates the total energy budget of the gas,
suggesting that the outflows encompasses the global interstellar medium,
perhaps facilitated by the strong gas turbulence. We compare with recent
hydrodynamic simulations, and discuss the potential consequences for the
subsequent evolution of massive high-z galaxies. The gas-phase metallicities in
our galaxies are lower than in most low-z AGN, but nonetheless solar or even
super-solar, suggesting that the ISM in these galaxies is very similar to the
gas from which massive low-redshift galaxies formed most of their gas. This
further highlights that we are seeing these galaxies near the end of their
active formation phase.

first order metamagnetic type transition from antiferromagnetic (AFI) to
ferromagnetic (F) states takes place at Tt ~ 158 K, and a second order
transition from ferromagnetic (F) to antiferromagnetic (AFII) states occurs at
TC ~196 K, the paramagnetic state occurring at T > TN = 238 K. Magnetic entropy
changes were calculated using, Maxwell relation and Clausius-Clapeyron
equation. Both approaches are compared and discussed. The AFI-F transition in
MnRhAs gives rise to an interestingly high level of negative magnetocaloric
effect. Under a field change 0-1 T, the maximum magnetic entropy variation is
about 3 J/kg K. For sufficiently high enough magnetic fields, the
magnetocaloric working temperature range below 158 K can be covered. The F-AFII
transition is accompanied by a relatively modest MCE (-2.3 J/kg K for 5 T at TC
= 196 K), but it improves the working temperature span as well as the
magnetocaloric properties. A minimum estimated refrigerant capacity of about
900 J/kg can be provided by a MnRhAs single crystal compound

with revival are not what is seen for the more frequently addressed problem of
a few TLMs interacting with a photon distribution with a large mean photon

entanglement, and the Q function are considered. It is found that
disentanglement only occurs at the revival times as evidenced by the entropy

doped SrTiO3 - the plasmon-mediated pairing and the potential of an
instantaneous attraction between two electrons that owes its origin to the
exchange by high-frequency optical phonons. The first approach seems to be
self-consistent, but in a limited range of the dielectric constant. As to the
direct instantaneous interaction between two electrons,it was hypothesized as
due to the exchange by the band LO phonons. The latter supposition was
incorrect. In the current paper, it shows that the contributions into the
pairing matrix element possessing the structure of a net attraction come about
only as the result of disorder. Indeed, the experiment revealed the mobility
edge in doped SrTiO3. Doped electrons occupying states with the energy below
the mobility edge are localized on dopants thereby become strongly coupled with
the lattice vibrations. The emergence of the localized phonon modes attached to
defect is one of the results of such electron-lattice coupling. For two
electrons in the conduction band the virtual exchange by the quantum of such
local mode manifests itself as the effective attraction. The total contribution
into the pairing matrix element from these processes, increasing with
concentration can overwhelm the Coulomb repulsion screened by the band LO
phonons. That is, the role previously ascribed to the band LO phonons actually
belongs to the localized phonons.

evaluating related works on AS-level adversaries, the author proposes
ASmoniTor, which is an autonomous system monitor for mitigating correlation
attacks in the Tor network. In contrast to prior works, which often released
offline packets, including the source code of a modified Tor client and a
snapshot of the Internet topology, ASmoniTor is an online system that assists
end users with mitigating the threat of AS-level adversaries in a near
real-time fashion. For Tor clients proposed in previous works, users need to
compile the source code on their machine and continually update the snapshot of
the Internet topology in order to obtain accurate AS-path inferences. On the
contrary, ASmoniTor is an online platform that can be utilized easily by not
only technical users, but also by users without a technical background, because
they only need to access it via Tor and input two parameters to execute an
AS-aware path selection algorithm. With ASmoniTor, the author makes three key
technical contributions to the research against AS-level adversaries in the Tor
network. First, ASmoniTor does not require the users to initiate complicated
source code compilations. Second, it helps to reduce errors in AS-path
inferences by letting users input a set of suspected ASes obtained directly
from their own traceroute measurements. Third, the Internet topology database
at the back-end of ASmoniTor is periodically updated to assure near real-time
AS-path inferences between Tor exit nodes and the most likely visited websites.
Finally, in addition to its convenience, ASmoniTor gives users full control
over the information they want to input, thus preserving their privacy.

  We complement the upper bound with a lower bound showing that no sampling

particular, any insertion stream algorithm must use $\sqrt{T}$ space when all
the triangles share a common vertex, and any sampling algorithm must take
$T^\frac{1}{3}$ samples when all the triangles are independent. We add another

  Prosumers",,,,,"cs.GT cs.IT cs.LG cs.SY math.IT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In this paper, the problem of smart grid energy management under stochastic
dynamics is investigated. In the considered model, at the demand side, it is
assumed that customers can act as prosumers who own renewable energy sources
and can both produce and consume energy. Due to the coupling between the
prosumers' decisions and the stochastic nature of renewable energy, the
interaction among prosumers is formulated as a stochastic game, in which each
prosumer seeks to maximize its payoff, in terms of revenues, by controlling its
energy consumption and demand. In particular, the subjective behavior of
prosumers is explicitly reflected into their payoff functions using prospect
theory, a powerful framework that allows modeling real-life human choices. For
this prospect-based stochastic game, it is shown that there always exists a
stationary Nash equilibrium where the prosumers' trading policies in the
equilibrium are independent of the time and their histories of the play.
Moreover, a novel distributed algorithm with no information sharing among
prosumers is proposed and shown to converge to an $\epsilon$-Nash equilibrium.
On the other hand, at the supply side, the interaction between the utility
company and the prosumers is formulated as an online optimization problem in
which the utility company's goal is to learn its optimal energy allocation
rules. For this case, it is shown that such an optimization problem admits a
no-regret algorithm meaning that regardless of the actual outcome of the game
among the prosumers, the utility company can follow a strategy that mitigates
its allocation costs as if it knew the entire demand market a priori.
Simulation results show the convergence of the proposed algorithms to their
predicted outcomes and present new insights resulting from prospect theory that
contribute toward more efficient energy management in the smart grids.

study tradeoffs between computation time and network complexity in this model.
Our aim is to abstract real neural networks in a way that, while not capturing
all interesting features, preserves high-level behavior and allows us to make
biologically relevant conclusions.
  In this paper, we focus on the important `winner-take-all' (WTA) problem,
which is analogous to a neural leader election unit: a network consisting of
$n$ input neurons and $n$ corresponding output neurons must converge to a state
in which a single output corresponding to a firing input (the `winner') fires,
while all other outputs remain silent. Neural circuits for WTA rely on
inhibitory neurons, which suppress the activity of competing outputs and drive
the network towards a converged state with a single firing winner. We attempt
to understand how the number of inhibitors used affects network convergence
time.
  We show that it is possible to significantly outperform naive WTA
constructions through a more refined use of inhibition, solving the problem in
$O(\theta)$ rounds in expectation with just $O(\log^{1/\theta} n)$ inhibitors
for any $\theta$. An alternative construction gives convergence in
$O(\log^{1/\theta} n)$ rounds with $O(\theta)$ inhibitors. We compliment these
upper bounds with our main technical contribution, a nearly matching lower
bound for networks using $\ge \log\log n$ inhibitors. Our lower bound uses
familiar indistinguishability and locality arguments from distributed computing
theory. It lets us derive a number of interesting conclusions about the
structure of any network solving WTA with good probability, and the use of
randomness and inhibition within such a network.

  We study the effect of Pok\'emon Go on physical activity through a
combination of signals from large-scale corpora of wearable sensor data and
search engine logs for 32 thousand users over a period of three months.
Pok\'emon Go players are identified through search engine queries and activity
is measured through accelerometry. We find that Pok\'emon Go leads to
significant increases in physical activity over a period of 30 days, with
particularly engaged users (i.e., those making multiple search queries for
details about game usage) increasing their activity by 1473 steps a day on
average, a more than 25% increase compared to their prior activity level
($p<10^{-15}$). In the short time span of the study, we estimate that Pok\'emon
Go has added a total of 144 billion steps to US physical activity. Furthermore,
Pok\'emon Go has been able to increase physical activity across men and women
of all ages, weight status, and prior activity levels showing this form of game
leads to increases in physical activity with significant implications for

changes comprise volume exchanges between connected spheres that can control
their separation, which are simple enough that significant analytical results

approach closely during a cycle. Previous analyses were predicated on wide
separation, and we show that the speed in- creases significantly as the
separation decreases due to the strong hydrodynamic interactions between
spheres in close proximity. The scallop theorem asserts that at least two
degrees of freedom are needed to produce net motion in a cyclic sequence of

models to gain simulation speed. However, a persistent question is to what
extent the results derived from a simplified core model can be used to
characterize the behavior of a real machine.
  We propose a new methodology of validating simplified simulation models,
which focuses on the trends of metric values across benchmarks and
architectures, instead of errors of absolute metric values. To illustrate this
methodology, we conduct a case study using an FPGA-accelerated cycle-accurate
full system simulator. We evaluated three cache replacement polices on a
10-stage in-order core model, and then re-conducted all the experiments by
substituting a 1-IPC core model for the 10-stage core model. We found that the
1-IPC core model generally produces qualitatively the same results as the
accurate core model except for a few mismatches. We argue that most observed
mismatches were either indistinguishable from experimental noise or
corresponded to the cases where the policy differences even in the accurate
model showed inconclusive results. We think it is fair to use simplified core
models to study a feature once the influence of the simplification is
understood. Additional studies on branch predictors and scaling properties of
multithread benchmarks reinforce our argument. However, the validation of a
simplified model requires a detailed cycle-accurate model!

the development of local, small-scale distribution grids, known as microgrids
(MGs). In this paper, the problem of optimizing the energy trading decisions of
MG operators (MGOs) is studied using game theory. In the formulated game, each
MGO chooses the amount of energy that must be sold immediately or stored for
future emergencies, given the prospective market prices which are influenced by
other MGOs' decisions. The problem is modeled using a Bayesian game to account
for the incomplete information that MGOs have about each others' levels of
surplus. The proposed game explicitly accounts for each MGO's subjective
decision when faced with the uncertainty of its opponents' energy surplus. In
particular, the so-called framing effect, from the framework of prospect theory
(PT), is used to account for each MGO's valuation of its gains and losses with
respect to an individual utility reference point. The reference point is
typically different for each individual and originates from its past
experiences and future aspirations. A closed-form expression for the Bayesian
Nash equilibrium is derived for the standard game formulation. Under PT, a best
response algorithm is proposed to find the equilibrium. Simulation results show
that, depending on their individual reference points, MGOs can tend to store
more or less energy under PT compared to classical game theory. In addition,
the impact of the reference point is found to be more prominent as the
emergency price set by the power company increases.

oversampling for the quasi-static Maxwell's equations in the frequency domain.
We assume a coarse mesh nested within a fine mesh that accurately discretizes
the problem. For each coarse cell, we independently solve a local version of
the original Maxwell's system subject to linear boundary conditions on an
extended domain, which includes the coarse cell and a neighborhood of fine
cells around it. The local Maxwell's system is solved using the fine mesh
contained in the extended domain and the mimetic finite volume method. Next,
these local solutions (basis functions) together with a weak-continuity
condition are used to construct a coarse-mesh version of the global problem.
The basis functions can be used to obtain the fine-mesh details from the
solution of the coarse-mesh problem. Our approach leads to a significant
reduction in the size of the final system of equations and the computational
time, while accurately approximating the behavior of the fine-mesh solutions.
We demonstrate the performance of our method using a synthetic 3D example of a
mineral deposit.

than the characteristic mass $M_{\rm C}$ of halos collapsing at a given epoch)
in high-density environments have lower accretion rates, lower spins, higher
concentrations, and rounder shapes than halos in median density environments.
Halos in median and low-density environments have similar accretion rates and
concentrations, but halos in low density environments have lower spins and are
more elongated. Halos of a given mass in high-density regions accrete material
earlier than halos of the same mass in lower-density regions. All but the most
massive halos in high-density regions are losing mass (i.e., being stripped) at
low redshifts, which causes artificially lowered NFW scale radii and increased
concentrations. Tidal effects are also responsible for the decreasing spins of
low mass halos in high density regions at low redshifts $z < 1$, by
preferentially removing higher angular momentum material from halos. Halos in
low-density regions have lower than average spins because they lack nearby
halos whose tidal fields can spin them up. We also show that the simulation
density distribution is well fit by an Extreme Value Distribution, and that the
density distribution becomes broader with cosmic time.

  Game-Theoretic Analysis with Application to Smart Grid Protection",,,,,"cs.GT cs.IT math.IT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In this paper, a general model for cyber-physical systems (CPSs), that
captures the diffusion of attacks from the cyber layer to the physical system,
is studied. In particular, a game-theoretic approach is proposed to analyze the
interactions between one defender and one attacker over a CPS. In this game,
the attacker launches cyber attacks on a number of cyber components of the CPS
to maximize the potential harm to the physical system while the system operator
chooses to defend a number of cyber nodes to thwart the attacks and minimize
potential damage to the physical side. The proposed game explicitly accounts
for the fact that both attacker and defender can have different computational
capabilities and disparate levels of knowledge of the system. To capture such
bounded rationality of attacker and defender, a novel approach inspired from
the behavioral framework of cognitive hierarchy theory is developed. In this
framework, the defender is assumed to be faced with an attacker that can have
different possible thinking levels reflecting its knowledge of the system and
computational capabilities. To solve the game, the optimal strategies of each
attacker type are characterized and the optimal response of the defender facing
these different types is computed. This general approach is applied to smart
grid security considering wide area protection with energy markets
implications. Numerical results show that a deviation from the Nash equilibrium
strategy is beneficial when the bounded rationality of the attacker is
considered. Moreover, the results show that the defender's incentive to deviate
from the Nash equilibrium decreases when faced with an attacker that has high
computational ability.

\mathbb{R}^{4}$ by considering gravitational interaction that corresponds to
this geometric space. The analysis is performed within microcanonical
description of an isolated Hamiltonian system by combining continuum
approximation and steepest descend method. According to numerical solution of
resulting equations, the gravitational clustering can be associated with two
microcanonical phase transitions. A first phase transition with a continuous
character is associated with breakdown of $SO(4)$ symmetry of this model. The
second one is the gravitational collapse, whose continuous or discontinuous
character crucially depends on the regularization of short-range divergence of
gravitation potential. We also derive the thermodynamic limit of this model
system, the astrophysical counterpart of Gibbs-Duhem relation, the order
parameters that characterize its phase transitions and the equation of state.
Other interesting behavior is the existence of states with negative heat
capacities, which appear when the effects of gravitation turn dominant for
energies sufficiently low. Finally, we comment the relevance of some of these
results in the study of astrophysical and cosmological situations. Special
interest deserves the gravitational modification of the equation of state due
to the local inhomogeneities of matter distribution. Although this feature is
systematically neglected in studies about Universe expansion, the same one is
able to mimic an effect that is attributed to the dark energy: a negative

reduce the number of free parameters when compared to traditional empirical

programming, a subset of convex optimization, can solve the particular problem
represented by the constraints . We were able to implement a program abiding to
their formulation of a semidefinite program (SDP), leading us to find that it
takes an immense amount of storage and time to compute. To combat this setback,
we then formulated an approach to improve results of the SDP using matrix
sparsity. Through the development of this approach, along with an
implementation of a rudimentary solver, we demonstrate how matrix sparsity
reduces the amount of time and storage required to compute the SDP -- overall
ensuring further improvements will likely be made to reach the theorized lower
bound

the connections between global minimizers of the constrained $\ell_0$ problem

provides a comprehensive investigation on optimal solutions of these two
problems and their connections. We give detailed descriptions of optimal

least square penalty problem probably has no common optimal solutions with the

significant research attention, thanks to excellent scalability properties of
this algorithm, and to its efficiency in the context of training deep neural
networks. A fundamental barrier for parallelizing large-scale SGD is the fact
that the cost of communicating the gradient updates between nodes can be very
large. Consequently, lossy compression heuristics have been proposed, by which
nodes only communicate quantized gradients. Although effective in practice,
these heuristics do not always provably converge, and it is not clear whether
they are optimal.
  In this paper, we propose Quantized SGD (QSGD), a family of compression
schemes which allow the compression of gradient updates at each node, while
guaranteeing convergence under standard assumptions. QSGD allows the user to
trade off compression and convergence time: it can communicate a sublinear
number of bits per iteration in the model dimension, and can achieve
asymptotically optimal communication cost. We complement our theoretical
results with empirical data, showing that QSGD can significantly reduce
communication cost, while being competitive with standard uncompressed
techniques on a variety of real tasks.
  In particular, experiments show that gradient quantization applied to
training of deep neural networks for image classification and automated speech
recognition can lead to significant reductions in communication cost, and
end-to-end training time. For instance, on 16 GPUs, we are able to train a
ResNet-152 network on ImageNet 1.8x faster to full accuracy. Of note, we show
that there exist generic parameter settings under which all known network
architectures preserve or slightly improve their full accuracy when using
quantization.

quadrupole and the screen is preferred because it gives a better thin-lens
approximation. A high bunch-charge beam, however, will undergo emittance growth
in the long drift caused by the space-charge force. We present a method that
mitigates this growth by introducing a quadrupole scan with a short drift and
without using the thin-lens approximation. The quadrupole in this method is
treated as a thick lens, and the emittance is extracted by using the thick-lens
equations. Apart from being precise, our method can be readily applied without
making any change to the beamline and has no need for a big drift space. For

both well-confined and almost nondiffracting while moving along a helix with
its radius, period, the number of rotations and main lobes highly adjustable.
In addition, the main lobe contains almost half of the optical power and the
peak intensity fluctuates below 15% during propagation. These promising
characteristics may enable a variety of potential applications based on these
beams.

walks of identical particles initially located on either edge of commensurate
AAH lattices in detail. It is shown that the quantum walker is delocalized
among the whole lattice until the strength of periodic modulation is strong
enough. The inverse participation ratios (IPRs) for all of the eigenstates are
calculated. It is found that the localization properties of the quantum walker
is mainly determined by the IPRs of the topologically protected edge states.
More interestingly, the edge states are shown to have an exotic
`\emph{repulsion}' effect on quantum walkers initiated from the lattice sites
inside the bulk. Furthermore, we examine the role of nearest-neighbour
interaction on the quantum walks of two identical fermions. Clear enhancement
of the `\emph{repulsion}' effect by strong interaction has been shown.

regime by employing a recent quantum formalism which treats mass as an
operator. This leads to interactions between non-degenerate internal degrees of
freedom (like spin in an external magnetic field) and external degrees of
freedom (like position). Based on these effects, we present an unusual
phenomenon, in which a falling double slit interference pattern periodically
decoheres and recoheres. The oscillations in the visibility of this
interference occur due to correlations built up between spin and position.

present paper leverages online learning advances to facilitate stochastic
resource allocation tasks. By recognizing the central role of Lagrange
multipliers, the underlying constrained optimization problem is formulated as a
machine learning task involving both training and operational modes, with the
goal of learning the sought multipliers in a fast and efficient manner. To this
end, an order-optimal offline learning approach is developed first for batch
training, and it is then generalized to the online setting with a procedure
termed learn-and-adapt. The novel resource allocation protocol permeates
benefits of stochastic approximation and statistical learning to obtain
low-complexity online updates with learning errors close to the statistical
accuracy limits, while still preserving adaptation performance, which in the
stochastic network optimization context guarantees queue stability. Analysis
and simulated tests demonstrate that the proposed data-driven approach improves
the delay and convergence performance of existing resource allocation schemes.

Intel CPUs, Linux kernels and user-space frameworks meet these constraints,
although this has only become true recently. With some novel optimizations, our
system RR records and replays real-world workloads with low overhead with an

of wind material from $\sim$30 massive Wolf-Rayet (WR) stars orbiting within
12"" of the super-massive black hole (SMBH) playing an important role.
Hydrodynamic simulations of such colliding and accreting winds produce a
complex density and temperature structure of cold wind material shocking with
the ambient medium, creating a large reservoir of hot, X-ray-emitting gas. This
work aims to confront the 3Ms of Chandra X-ray Visionary Program (XVP)
observations of this diffuse emission by computing the X-ray emission from
these hydrodynamic simulations of the colliding WR winds, amid exploring a
variety of SMBH feedback mechanisms. The major success of the model is that it
reproduces the spectral shape from the 2""--5"" ring around the SMBH, where most
of the stellar wind material that is ultimately captured by Sgr A* is
shock-heated and thermalised. This naturally explains that the hot gas comes
from colliding WR winds, and that the wind speeds of these stars are in general
well constrained. The flux level of these spectra, as well as 12""$\times$12""
images of 4--9 keV, show the X-ray flux is tied to the SMBH feedback strength;
stronger feedback clears out more hot gas, thereby decreasing the thermal X-ray
emission. The model in which Sgr A* produced an intermediate-strength outflow
during the last few centuries best matches the observations to within about
10%, showing SMBH feedback is required to interpret the X-ray emission in this
region.

a general reconstruction scheme that yields operationally well-defined dynamics

can be performed, these `restricted' dynamics allow for the construction of
witnesses for initial correlations and the presence of memory effects. We
demonstrate the applicability of our framework for the the two important cases

magnetic activity dominates the RV variations over the low amplitude signal
induced by low mass planets. Models of stars that differ from the Sun will
require a good knowledge of the attenuation of the convective blueshift to
estimate its impact on the variations. It is therefore crucial to precisely
determine not only the amplitude of the convective blueshift for different
types of stars, but also the dependence of this convective blueshift on
magnetic activity, as these are key factors in our model producing the RV. We
studied a sample of main sequence stars with spectral types from G0 to K2 and
focused on their temporally averaged properties: the activity level and a
criterion allowing to characterise the amplitude of the convective blueshift.
We find the differential velocity shifts of spectral lines due to convection to
depend on the spectral type, the wavelength (this dependence is correlated with
the Teff and activity level), and on the activity level. This allows us to
quantify the dependence of granulation properties on magnetic activity for
stars other than the Sun. The attenuation factor of the convective blueshift
appears to be constant over the considered range of spectral types. We derive a
convective blueshift which decreases towards lower temperatures, with a trend
in close agreement with models for Teff lower than 5800 K, but with a
significantly larger global amplitude. We finally compare the observed RV
variation amplitudes with those that could be derived from our convective
blueshift using a simple law and find a general agreement on the amplitude. Our
results are consistent with previous results and provide, for the first time,
an estimation of the convective blueshift as a function of Teff, magnetic
activity, and wavelength, over a large sample of G and K main sequence stars.

transition in disordered systems from the Griffiths phase to ferromagnetic
phase is reexamined. From the saddle point solutions, especially the excited
state solutions, it is shown that the system self-organizes into blocks coupled
with their neighbors like superspins, which are emergent variables. Taking the
fluctuation around these saddle point solutions into account, we get an
effective Hamiltonian, including the emergent superspins of the blocks, the
fluctuation around the saddle point solutions, and their couplings. Applying
Stratonovich-Hubbard transformation to the part of superspins, we get a
Landau-Ginzburg-Wilson Hamiltonian for the blocks. From the saddle point
equations for the blocks, we can get the second generation blocks, of which
sizes are much larger than the first generation blocks. Repeating this
procedure again and again, we get many generations of blocks to describe the
asymptotic behavior. If a field is applied, the effective field on the
superspins is multiplied greatly and proportional to the block size. For a very
small field, the effective field on the higher generation superspins can be so
strong to cause the superspins polarizaed radically. This can explain the extra
large critical isotherm exponent discovered in the experiments. The phase space
of reduced temperature vs. field is divided into many layers , in which
different generation blocks dominate the critical behavior. The sizes of the
different generation emergent blocks are new relevant length scales. This can
explain a lot of puzzles in the experiments and the Monte Carlo simulation.

nearest-neighbour (NN) interaction ($J_1$) and antiferromagnetic (AFM)
next-nearest-neighbour (NNN) interaction ($J_2$). Contrary to the general
wisdom that long-range ferromagnetic order is not energy preferable under
frustration, the skyrmion lattice not only exists but is even stable for a
large field range when $J_2 \leq J_1$ compared with frustration-free systems.
We defend that the enlargement of stability window of skyrmions is a
consequence of the reduced effective exchange interaction caused by the
frustration. A multi-sublattice helical state is found below the skyrmion
phase, which results from the competition between AFM coupling that favors a
two-sublattice N\'{e}el state and the chiral interaction that prefers a helix.
As a byproduct, the hysteresis loop of the frustrated chiral system shrinks as
the magnetization goes to zero and then opens up again, known as wasp-waist
hysteresis loop. The critical field that separates the narrow and wide part of
the wasp-waist loop depends exponentially on the strength of NNN coupling. By
measuring the critical field, it is possible to determine the strength of NNN
coupling.

fully convolutional neural networks (CFCNs) and dense 3D conditional random

models were trained in a 2-fold cross-validation on the abdominal CT dataset
3DIRCAD comprising 15 hepatic tumor volumes. Our results show that CFCN-based
semantic liver and lesion segmentation achieves Dice scores over 94% for liver

  Processing on September 2016",,,,"cs.IT math.AG math.IT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  A new approach to solving a class of rankconstrained semi-definite
programming (SDP) problems, which appear in many signal processing applications
such as transmit beamspace design in multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO)
radar, downlink beamforming design in MIMO communications, generalized sidelobe
canceller design, phase retrieval, etc., is presented. The essence of the
approach is the use of underlying algebraic structure enforced in such problems
by other practical constraints such as, for example, null shaping constraint.
According to this approach, instead of relaxing the non-convex rankconstrained
SDP problem to a feasible set of positive semidefinite matrices, we restrict it
to a space of polynomials whose dimension is equal to the desired rank. The
resulting optimization problem is then convex as its solution is required to be
full rank, and can be efficiently and exactly solved. A simple matrix
decomposition is needed to recover the solution of the original problem from
the solution of the restricted one. We show how this approach can be applied to
solving some important signal processing problems that contain null-shaping
constraints. As a byproduct of our study, the conjugacy of beamfoming and
parameter estimation problems leads us to formulation of a new and rigorous
criterion for signal/noise subspace identification. Simulation results are
performed for the problem of rank-constrained beamforming design and show an
exact agreement of the solution with the proposed algebraic structure, as well
as significant performance improvements in terms of sidelobe suppression
compared to the existing methods.

provide here the first systematic comparison of six existing methods for the
estimation of the helicity of magnetic fields known in a finite volume. All
such methods are reviewed, benchmarked, and compared with each other, and
specifically tested for accuracy and sensitivity to errors. To that purpose, we
consider four groups of numerical tests, ranging from solutions of the
three-dimensional, force-free equilibrium, to magneto-hydrodynamical numerical
simulations. Almost all methods are found to produce the same value of magnetic
helicity within few percent in all tests. In the more solar-relevant and
realistic of the tests employed here, the simulation of an eruptive flux rope,
the spread in the computed values obtained by all but one method is only 3%,
indicating the reliability and mutual consistency of such methods in
appropriate parameter ranges. However, methods show differences in the
sensitivity to numerical resolution and to errors in the solenoidal property of
the input fields. In addition to finite volume methods, we also briefly discuss
a method that estimates helicity from the field lines' twist, and one that
exploits the field's value at one boundary and a coronal minimal connectivity
instead of a pre-defined three-dimensional magnetic-field solution.

carried out relative to an arbitrary but fixed set x. A classic result from
ordinal analysis is the characterisation of the provably recursive functions of
Peano Arithmetic, PA, by means of the fast growing hierarchy [10]. Whilst it is
possible to formulate the natural numbers within KP, the theory speaks
primarily about sets. For this reason it is desirable to obtain a
characterisation of its provably total set functions. We will show that KP
proves the totality of a set function precisely when it falls within a
hierarchy of set functions based upon a relativised constructible hierarchy
stretching up in length to any ordinal below the Bachmann-Howard ordinal. As a
consequence of this result we obtain that IKP + forall x,y (x in y or x not in
y) is conservative over KP for forall-exists-formulae, where IKP stands for
intuitionistic Kripke-Platek set theory. In a similar vein, utilising [56], it
is shown that KP(P) proves the totality of a set function precisely when it
falls within a hierarchy of set functions based upon a relativised von Neumann
hierarchy of the same length. The relativisation technique applied to KP(P)
with the global axiom of choice, AC-global, also yields a parameterised
extension of a result in [58], showing that KP(P) + AC-global is conservative
over KP(P) + AC and CZF + AC for Pi_2 in powerset statements. Here AC stands
for the ordinary axiom of choice and CZF refers to constructive
Zermelo-Fraenkel set theory.

all living organisms. In this paper we show that this process can be explored
by using the age-specific infant death rate as a kind of sensor. This is made
possible because, as shown by the authors in Berrut et al. (2016), between
birth and a critical age t_c, for all mammals the death rate decreases with age
as an hyperbolic function. For humans t_c is equal to 10 years. At some ages
the hyperbolic fall displays spikes which, it is assumed, correspond to
specific events in the organism's response to exogenous factors. One of these
spikes occurs 10 days after birth and there is another at the age of about 300
days. It is shown that the first spike is related to viral infections whereas
the second is related to bacterial diseases. By going back to former time
periods during which infant mortality was much higher than currently, it is
possible to get a magnified view of these peaks which in turn may give us
useful information about how an organism adapts to new conditions. Apart from
pathogens, the same methodology can be used to study the response to changes in
other external conditions, e.g. supply of food, temperature or oxygen level.

Methods. Using the model for cool close binary evolution, developed by one of
us (KS), progenitors of all investigated binaries were found and their
parameters evolved into the presently observed values. Results. The results
show that the progenitors of the binary blue stragglers are cool close binaries
with period of a few days, which transform into stragglers by rejuvenation of
the initially less massive component by mass transfer from its more massive
companion overflowing the inner critical Roche surface. The parameters of V209
from \omega Cen indicate that the binary is substantially enriched in helium.
This is an independent and strong evidence for the existence of the helium rich

is governed by the asymmetry of the microscopic binding potential, which cannot
be adjusted easily. In artificial crystals called metamaterials, thermal
expansion can be controlled by structure. Here, following previous theoretical
work, we fabricate three-dimensional two-component polymer microlattices by
using gray-tone laser lithography. We perform cross-correlation analysis of
optical microscopy images taken at different sample temperatures. The derived
displacement-vector field reveals that the thermal expansion and resulting
bending of the bi-material beams leads to a rotation of the 3D chiral crosses
arranged onto a 3D checkerboard pattern within one metamaterial unit cell.
These rotations can over-compensate the expansion and lead to an effectively
negative thermal length-expansion coefficient for all positive constituents

theory of Heun's equation. In this paper, we prove that all the roots of such

homogeneous hydrodynamics, i.e. there are macroscopic evolution equations for

states and not only the homogeneous steady state reached eventually by the
system. It is shown that in some cases the linear analysis is not enough to
reach a definite conclusion on the stability, and molecular dynamics simulation
results are presented to elucidate these cases. The analysis shows the
relevance of nonlinear hydrodynamic contributions to describe the behavior of
spontaneous fluctuations occurring in the system, that lead even to the

optical system complex, expensive and challenging for manufacturing and
alignment. An all-spherical configuration is a cost-effective and simple
solution. We have aimed for a small payload which may be launched by different
platforms and we have designed a compact, light-weight payload which will
withstand all launch loads. No other UV payloads have been previously reported
with an all-spherical optical design for imaging in the NUV domain and a weight
below 2 kg. Our main science goal is focussed on bright UV sources not
accessible by the more sensitive large space UV missions.
  Here we discuss various aspects of design and development of the complete
instrument, the structural and finite-element analysis of the system performed
to ensure that the payload withstands launch-load stresses and vibrations. We
expect to fly this telescope -- Lunar Ultraviolet Cosmic Imager (LUCI) -- on a

illustrative example, we apply our theory to investigate a domain wall floating

propose a general explanation based on the oscillatory possibilities of the

exhibiting self-sustained oscillations of unbounded complexity: complex
evolutions by nonlinear mixing of an arbitrarily large number of oscillation
modes, in which the different modes describe specific dynamical activities and
their combination articulates the interactive conjunction of such activities
into the whole functioning. The dynamical scenario is rather generic since it
is exclusively based on the reiterative occurrence of the two most standard
mechanisms of nonlinear dynamics: the saddle-node and Hopf bifurcations, and
its extraordinary richness makes feasible the well-defined occurrence of
ordered features over enormously complex dynamical activities as simply arising
from the proper structure of dynamical relations among the system components,
i.e., without requiring any other physical cause than those involved in such
relations.

shift is determined solely by the large-distance (""infra-red"", IR) limit of the
model, and is equal to the free energy distribution at the critical temperature
up to a translation. the decoration process is determined solely by the
small-distance (""ultraviolet"", UV) limit, in terms of the biased minimal
process. Our approach provides connections of the replica framework to results
in the probability literature and sheds further light on the freezing/duality
conjecture which was the source of many previous results for log-REMs. In this
way we derive the general and explicit formulae for the joint probability
density of depths of the first and second minima (as well its higher-order
generalizations) in terms of model-specific contributions from UV as well as IR
limits. In particular, we show that the second min statistics is largely

such as those of weakly interacting massive particles (WIMPs), generically lead
to the structuring of dark matter on scales much smaller than typical galaxies,
potentially down to $\sim 10^{-10}M_\odot$. This clustering translates into a
very large population of subhalos in galaxies and affects the predictions for
direct and indirect dark matter searches (gamma rays and antimatter cosmic
rays). In this paper, we elaborate on previous analytic works to model the
Galactic subhalo population, while consistently with current observational
dynamical constraints on the Milky Way. In particular, we propose a
self-consistent method to account for tidal effects induced by both dark matter
and baryons. Our model does not strongly rely on cosmological simulations as
they can hardly be fully matched to the real Milky Way, but for setting the
initial subhalo mass fraction. Still, it allows to recover the main qualitative
features of simulated systems. It can further be easily adapted to any change
in the dynamical constraints, and be used to make predictions or derive
constraints on dark matter candidates from indirect or direct searches. We
compute the annihilation boost factor, including the subhalo-halo
cross-product. We confirm that tidal effects induced by the baryonic components
of the Galaxy play a very important role, resulting in a local average subhalo
mass density $\lesssim 1\%$ of the total local dark matter mass density, while
selecting in the most concentrated objects and leading to interesting features
in the overall annihilation profile in the case of a sharp subhalo mass
function. Values of global annihilation boost factors range from $\sim 2$ to
$\sim 20$, while the local annihilation rate is about half as much boosted.

potential in such a microscopic many-body theory, we firstly have to construct
a one-boson-exchange potential (OBEP) based on the latest lattice $NN$
potential. Three mesons, pion, $\sigma$ meson, and $\omega$ meson, are
considered. Their coupling constants and cut-off momenta are determined by
fitting the on-shell behaviors and phase shifts of the lattice force,
respectively. Therefore, we obtain two parameter sets of the OBEP potential
(named as LOBEP1 and LOBEP2) with these two fitting ways. We calculate the
properties of symmetric and pure neutron matter with LOBEP1 and LOBEP2. In
non-relativistic Brueckner-Hartree-Fock case, the binding energies of symmetric
nuclear matter are around $-3$ and $-5$ MeV at saturation densities, while it
becomes $-8$ and $-12$ MeV in relativistic framework with $^1S_0,~^3S_1,$ and
$^3D_1$ channels using our two parameter sets. For the pure neutron matter, the
equations of state in non-relativistic and relativistic cases are very similar

learn the related action models without the need for any frame-based

learn action models for each class by maximizing the probability that the

order as defined by the transcripts. The learned model can be used to
temporally segment an unseen video with or without transcript. We evaluate our
approach on four distinct activity datasets, namely Hollywood Extended, MPII

scripted actions with the video data and that the learned models localize and
classify actions competitively in comparison to models trained with full

semi-infinite bulk, it can be applied to semiconductors in combination with a

mass stars and the transition between the slow magnetic rotator and fast
magnetic rotator regimes. We aim to understand the properties of stellar winds
in the fast magnetic rotator regime and the effects of magneto-centrifugal
forces on wind speeds and mass loss rates.
  Methods: We extend the solar wind model of Johnstone et al. (2015b) to 1D
magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulations of the winds of rotating stars. We test
two assumptions for how to scale the wind temperature to other stars and assume
the mass loss rate scales as Mdot ~ Rstar^2 OmegaStar^1.33 Mstar^-3.36, in the
unsaturated regime, as estimated by Johnstone et al. (2015a).
  Results: For 1.0 Msun stars, the winds can be accelerated to several thousand
km/s, and the effects of magneto-centrifugal forces are much weaker for lower
mass stars. We find that the different assumptions for how to scale the wind
temperature to other stars lead to significantly different mass loss rates for
the rapid rotators. If we assume a constant temperature, the mass loss rates of
solar mass stars do not saturate at rapid rotation, which we show to be
inconsistent with observed rotational evolution. If we assume the wind
temperatures scale positively with rotation, the mass loss rates are only
influenced significantly at rotation rates above 75 OmegaSun. We suggest that
models with increasing wind speed for more rapid rotators are preferable to
those that assume a constant wind speed. If this conclusion is confirmed by
more sophisticated wind modelling. it might provide an interesting
observational constraint on the properties of stellar winds.

part, on the robust localisation of micro-calcifications ($\mu$C). Currently,
the most effective methods are based on three steps: 1) detection of individual
$\mu$C candidates, 2) clustering of individual $\mu$C candidates, and 3)
classification of $\mu$C clusters. Where the second step is motivated both to
reduce the number of false positive detections from the first step and on the
evidence that malignancy depends on a relatively large number of $\mu$C
detections within a certain area. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to
$\mu$C detection, consisting of the detection \emph{and} classification of
individual $\mu$C candidates, using shape and appearance features, using a
cascade of boosting classifiers. The final step in our approach then clusters
the remaining individual $\mu$C candidates. The main advantage of this approach
lies in its ability to reject a significant number of false positive $\mu$C
candidates compared to previously proposed methods. Specifically, on the
INbreast dataset, we show that our approach has a true positive rate (TPR) for
individual $\mu$Cs of 40\% at one false positive per image (FPI) and a TPR of
80\% at 10 FPI. These results are significantly more accurate than the current
state of the art, which has a TPR of less than 1\% at one FPI and a TPR of 10\%
at 10 FPI. Our results are competitive with the state of the art at the
subsequent stage of detecting clusters of $\mu$Cs.

performance of high-resolution parameter estimation algorithms in case of
coherent signals or if only a small number of snapshots is available. In this
paper, we present a first-order performance analysis of the spatially smoothed
versions of R-D Standard ESPRIT and R-D Unitary ESPRIT for sources with
arbitrary signal constellations as well as R-D NC Standard ESPRIT and R-D NC
Unitary ESPRIT for strictly second-order (SO) non-circular (NC) sources. The
derived expressions are asymptotic in the effective signal-to-noise ratio
(SNR), i.e., the approximations become exact for either high SNRs or a large
sample size. Moreover, no assumptions on the noise statistics are required
apart from a zero-mean and finite SO moments. We show that both R-D NC
ESPRIT-type algorithms with spatial smoothing perform asymptotically identical
in the high effective SNR regime. Generally, the performance of spatial
smoothing based algorithms depends on the number of subarrays, which is a
design parameter and needs to be chosen beforehand. In order to gain more
insights into the optimal choice of the number of subarrays, we simplify the
derived analytical R-D mean square error (MSE) expressions for the special case
of a single source. The obtained MSE expression explicitly depends on the
number of subarrays in each dimension, which allows us to analytically find the
optimal number of subarrays for spatial smoothing. Based on this result, we
additionally derive the maximum asymptotic gain from spatial smoothing and
explicitly compute the asymptotic efficiency for this special case. All the
analytical results are verified by simulations.

difficult task, and over the last two decades, an important research effort has
gone into developing preconditioners for the simplest representative of such
wave propagation problems, the Helmholtz equation. A specific class of these
new preconditioners are considered here. They were developed by researchers
with various backgrounds using formulations and notations that are very
different, and all are among the most promising preconditioners for the
Helmholtz equation.
  The goal of the present manuscript is to show that this class of
preconditioners are based on a common mathematical principle, and they can all
be formulated in the context of domain decomposition methods called optimized
Schwarz methods. This common formulation allows us to explain in detail how and
why all these methods work. The domain decomposition formulation also allows us
to avoid technicalities in the implementation description we give of these
recent methods.
  The equivalence of these methods with optimized Schwarz methods translates at
the discrete level into equivalence with approximate block LU decomposition
preconditioners, and we give in each case the algebraic version, including a
detailed description of the approximations used. While we chose to use the
Helmholtz equation for which these methods were developed, our notation is
completely general and the algorithms we give are written for an arbitrary
second order elliptic operator. The algebraic versions are even more general,
assuming only a connectivity pattern in the discretization matrix.

conducting the optimization using a limited number of system simulations.
Noteworthy features of this particular application include a non-hypercubic

uninhabitable, because liquid water does not remain stable at the surface as

We show with three-dimensional aqua-planet numerical experiments that
CO$_2$-induced forcing as readily destabilizes the climate as does solar
forcing. The climate instability is caused by a positive cloud feedback. The
climate does not run away, but instead attains a new steady state with
global-mean sea-surface temperatures above 330 K. The upper atmosphere is
considerably moister in this warm steady state than in the reference climate,
implying that the planet would be subject to substantial loss of water to

working horse of experiments but its operation is challenging, due to the large
electronic spin of the atoms. Here we present an experimental study of
narrow-line Dysprosium MOTs. We show that the combination of radiation pressure
and gravitational forces leads to a spontaneous polarization of the electronic
spin. The spin composition is measured using a Stern-Gerlach separation of spin
levels, revealing that the gas becomes almost fully spin-polarized for large
laser frequency detunings. In this regime, we reach the optimal operation of
the MOT, with samples of typically $3\times 10^8$ atoms at a temperature of
15\,$\mu$K. The spin polarization reduces the complexity of the radiative
cooling description, which allows for a simple model accounting for our
measurements. We also measure the rate of density-dependent atom losses,
finding good agreement with a model based on light-induced Van der Waals
forces. A minimal two-body loss rate $\beta\sim 2\times10^{-11}\,$cm$^{3}$/s is

introduce the generalized reparameterization gradient, a method that extends
the reparameterization gradient to a wider class of variational distributions.
Generalized reparameterizations use invertible transformations of the latent

variational parameters. This results in new Monte Carlo gradients that combine
reparameterization gradients and score function gradients. We demonstrate our

BiHom-Lie superalgebras from BiHom-associative superalgebras and Hom-Lie
superalgebras by Yau's twist principle. Also, we explore some general classes
of BiHom-Lie admissible superalgebras and describe all these classes via
$G$-BiHom-associative superalgebras, where $G$ is a subgroup of the symmetric
group $S_{3}$. Finally, we discuss the concept of $\beta^{k}$-derivation of
BiHom-Lie superalgebras and prove that the set of all $\beta^{k}$-derivation
has a natural BiHom-Lie superalgebra structure.

  via Trust Model","8 pages, 3 figures, conference",,,,"cs.DC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  This paper proposes a Bayesian modeling approach to address the problem of
online fault-tolerant dynamic event region detection in wireless sensor
networks. In our model every network node is associated with a virtual
community and a trust index, which quantitatively measures the trustworthiness
of this node in its community. If a sensor node's trust value is smaller than a
threshold, it suggests that this node encounters a fault and thus its sensor
reading can not be trusted at this moment. This concept of sensor node trust
discriminates our model with the other alternatives, e.g.,the Markov random
fields. The practical issues, including spatiotemporal correlations of neighbor
nodes' sensor readings, the presence of sensor faults and the requirement of
online processing are linked together by the concept trust and are all taken
into account in the modeling stage. Based on the proposed model, the trust
value of each node is updated online by a particle filter algorithm upon the
arrival of new observations. The decision on whether a node is located in the
event region is made based upon the current estimate of this node's trust
value. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed solution can provide
striking better performance than existent methods in terms of error rate in
detecting the event region.

surfaces exposed to single ultrashort laser pulses can appear due to an
instability induced by two-temperature heating dynamics. The results of
two-temperature model (TTM) 2D simulations are presented on the irradiation of
gold by a single 800 nm femtosecond laser pulse whose intensity is modulated in
order to reproduce a small initial temperature perturbation, which can arise
from incoming and scattered surface wave interference. The growing (unstable)
modes of the temperature distribution along the surface may be responsible for
the LIPSS (Laser Induced Periodic Surface Structures) formation. After the end
of the laser pulse and before the complete coupling between lattice and
electrons occurs, the evolution of the amplitude of the subsequent modulation
in the lattice temperature reveals different tendencies depending on the
spatial period of the initial modulation. This instability-like behaviour is
shown to arise due to the perturbation of the electronic temperature which
relaxes slower for bigger spatial periods and thus imparts more significant
modulations to the lattice temperature. Small spatial periods of the order of
100 nm and smaller experience stabilization and fast decay from the more
efficient lateral heat diffusion which facilitates the relaxation of the
electronic temperature amplitude due to in-depth diffusion. An analytical
instability analysis of a simplified version of the TTM set of equations
supports the lattice temperature modulation behaviour obtained in the
simulations and reveals that in-depth diffusion length is a determining
parameter in the dispersion relation of unstable modes. Finally it is discussed
how the change in optical properties can intensify the modulation-related
effects.

principal be used in this limit with near equivalent figures-of-merit (FOM). In
practice a bridge to PCP/Sagnac source noise rejection ratio of $1/4\theta_F^2$
enables the bridge to operate in the photon shot noise limit even at high light

measurement of a 3 nrad rotation arising from an axial magnetic field of 0.9 nT

organisms of the transition between unicellular and multicellular living forms.
Under nitrogen limiting conditions, in filaments of the genus Anabaena, some
cells differentiate into heterocysts, which lose the possibility to divide but
are able to fix environmental nitrogen for the colony. These heterocysts form a
quasi-regular pattern in the filament, representing a prototype of patterning
and morphogenesis in prokaryotes. Recent years have seen advances in the
identification of the molecular mechanism regulating this pattern. We use this
data to build a theory on heterocyst pattern formation, for which both genetic
regulation and the effects of cell division and filament growth are key
components. The theory is based on the interplay of three generic mechanisms:
local autoactivation, early long range inhibition, and late long range
inhibition. These mechanisms can be identified with the dynamics of hetR, patS
and hetN expression. Our theory reproduces quantitatively the experimental
dynamics of pattern formation and maintenance for wild type and mutants. We
find that hetN alone is not enough to play the role as the late inhibitory
mechanism: a second mechanism, hypothetically the products of nitrogen fixation
supplied by heterocysts, must also play a role in late long range inhibition.
The preponderance of even intervals between heterocysts arises naturally as a
result of the interplay between the timescales of genetic regulation and cell
division. We also find that a purely stochastic initiation of the pattern,
without a two-stage process, is enough to reproduce experimental observations.

We develop successive convex approximation based algorithms to tackle these

excited by two identical light fields from two ends of the cavity, the two
input light fields can be completely absorbed by the CQED system and the light
energy is converted into the excitation of the polariton states, but no light
can escape from the cavity. Two distinct cases of controlling the perfect
photon absorption are analyzed: (a) when the control laser is tuned to the
atomic resonance and creates electromagnetically induced transparency, the
prefect photon absorption is suppressed and the input light fields are nearly
completely transmitted through the cavity; (b) when the control laser is tuned
to the polariton state resonance and inhibits the polariton state excitation,
the perfect photon absorption is again suppressed and the input light fields
are nearly completely reflected from the cavity. Thus, the CQED system can act
as a perfect absorber or near perfect transmitter/reflector by simply turning
off or on of the control laser. Such interference control of the coherent
photon-atom interaction in the CQED system should be useful for a variety of
applications in optical logical devices.

development of Smoothness-Increasing Accuracy-Conserving (SIAC) filters for

These advantages can be exploited during flow visualization, for example by
applying the SIAC filter to the DG data before streamline computations [Steffan

proposed a univariate filter implemented along the streamline curves. Until

the SIAC line filter and explore how the orientation, structure and filter size
affect the order of accuracy and global errors. We present theoretical error
estimates showing how line filtering preserves the properties of traditional

cloud formation to protein crystallization. A recently emerging area where
nucleation is highly relevant is the initiation of filamentous protein
self-assembly, a process that has broad implications from medicine to
nanotechnology. As such, spontaneous nucleation of protein fibrils has received
much attention in recent years with many theoretical and experimental studies
focussing on the underlying physical principles. In this paper we make a step
forward in this direction and explore the early time behaviour of filamentous
protein growth in the context of nucleation theory. We first provide an
overview of the thermodynamics and kinetics of spontaneous nucleation of
protein filaments in the presence of one relevant degree of freedom, namely the
cluster size. In this case, we review how key kinetic observables, such as the
reaction order of spontaneous nucleation, are directly related to the physical
size of the critical nucleus. We then focus on the increasingly prominent case
of filament nucleation that includes a conformational conversion of the
nucleating building-block as an additional slow step in the nucleation process.
Using computer simulations, we study the concentration dependence of the
nucleation rate. We find that, under these circumstances, the reaction order of
spontaneous nucleation with respect to the free monomer does no longer relate
to the overall physical size of the nucleating aggregate but rather to the
portion of the aggregate that actively participates in the conformational
conversion. Our results thus provide a novel interpretation of the common
kinetic descriptors of protein filament formation, including the reaction order
of the nucleation step or the scaling exponent of lag times, and put into
perspective current theoretical descriptions of protein aggregation.

groups or clusters of different masses accordingly to the velocity of the
encounter. In the analysis we focus on bars' amplitude, size, pattern speed and
their rotation parameter, ${\cal R}=R_{CR}/R_{bar}$. The latter is used to
define fast (${\cal R}<1.4$) and slow rotation (${\cal R}>1.4$). Compared with
equivalent isolated galaxies we find that bars affected or triggered by
interactions: (i) remain in the slow regime for longer; (ii) are more boxy in
face-on views; (iii) they host kinematically hotter discs. Within this set of
simulations we do not see strong differences between retrograde or prograde

= 0 T retains a strong memory of the polarization magnitude and direction, such
that upon re-entering the ferroelectric phase a net polarization of comparable
magnitude to the initial polarization is recovered in the absence of external
bias. This memory effect is very robust: in pulsed-magnetic-field measurements,
several pulses into the ferroelectric phase with reverse bias are required to
switch the polarization direction, with significant switching only seen after
the system is driven out of the ferroelectric phase and ground state either
magnetically (by application of B > 13 T) or thermally. The memory effect is
also largely insensitive to the magnetoelastic domain composition, since no
change in the memory effect is observed for a sample driven into a
single-domain state by application of stress in the [1-10] direction. On the
basis of Monte Carlo simulations of the ground state spin configurations, we
propose that the memory effect is due to the existence of helical domain walls
within the nonpolar collinear antiferromagnetic ground state, which would
retain the helicity of the polar phase for certain magnetothermal histories.

ellipticities, and orientations of barlenses were measured and used to define
the barlens regions in the color measurements. The orientations of barlenses
were studied with respect to those of the ""thin bars"" and the line-of-nodes of
the disks. For 47 galaxies color maps were constructed using the SDSS images in
five optical bands, u, g, r, i, and z. Colors of bars, barlenses, disks, and
central regions of the galaxies were measured using two different approaches
and color-color diagrams sensitive to metallicity, stellar surface gravity, and
short lived stars were constructed. Color differences between the structure
components were calculated for each individual galaxy, and presented in
histogram form. We find that the colors of barlenses are very similar to those
of the surrounding bars, indicating that most probably they form part of the
bar. We also find that barlenses have orientations closer to the disk
line-of-nodes than to the thin bars, which is consistent with the idea that
they are vertically thick, in a similar manner as the boxy/peanut structures in
more inclined galaxies. Typically, the colors of barlenses are similar to those
of normal E/S0 galaxies. Galaxy by galaxy studies show that in spiral galaxies
very dusty barlenses also exist, along with barlenses with rejuvenated stellar
populations. The central regions of galaxies are found to be on average redder

compelling but technologically challenging strategy to provide an unambiguous
signature of the detection of Galactic dark matter. Most directional detectors
aim to reconstruct the dark-matter-induced nuclear recoil tracks, either in gas
or solid targets. The main challenge with directional detection is the need for
high spatial resolution over large volumes, which puts strong requirements on
the readout technologies. In this paper we review the various detector readout
technologies used by directional detectors. In particular, we summarize the
challenges, advantages and drawbacks of each approach, and discuss future
prospects for these technologies.

problem in the presence of spin orbit couplings, motivated by current interests
in exploring exotic superfluid phases in spin-orbit coupled Fermi gases. For
weak spin orbit coupling where the density of states is not significantly
altered, we analytically show that the high-energy states become more important
in determining the binding energy when the interaction strength decreases.
Consequently, tuning the interaction gives rise to a rich ground state
behavior, including a zigzag of the ground state momentum or inducing
transitions among the meta-stable states. By exactly solving the two-body
problem for a spin-orbit coupled Fermi mixture, we demonstrate that our
analysis can also apply to the case when the density of states is significantly
modified by the spin-orbit coupling. Our findings pave the way for
understanding and controlling the paring of fermions in the presence of spin

expensive. One reason for this is the fact that a fine mesh is required to
accurately discretize the electrical conductivity model of a given setting.
This conductivity model may vary over several orders of magnitude and these
variations can occur over a large range of length scales. Using a very fine
mesh for the discretization of this setting leads to the necessity to solve a
large system of equations that is often difficult to deal with. To keep the
simulations computationally tractable, coarse meshes are often employed for the
discretization of the model. Such coarse meshes typically fail to capture the
fine-scale variations in the conductivity model resulting in inaccuracies in
the predicted data. In this work, we introduce a framework for constructing a
coarse-mesh or upscaled conductivity model based on a prescribed fine-mesh
model. Rather than using analytical expressions, we opt to pose upscaling as a
parameter estimation problem. By solving an optimization problem, we obtain a
coarse-mesh conductivity model. The optimization criterion can be tailored to
the survey setting in order to produce coarse models that accurately reproduce
the predicted data generated on the fine mesh. This allows us to upscale
arbitrary conductivity structures, as well as to better understand the meaning
of the upscaled quantity. We use 1D and 3D examples to demonstrate that the
proposed framework is able to emulate the behavior of the heterogeneity in the
fine-mesh conductivity model, and to produce an accurate description of the
desired predicted data obtained by using a coarse mesh in the simulation
process.

mystery. Dozens of theory exists, but none have been able to entirely reproduce
the observational facts associated to this modulation phenomenon. Existing
theory all rely on the usual continuous modelization of the star. Aims. We
present a new paradigm which will not only explain the Blazhko effect, but at
the same time, will give us alternative explanations to the red limit of the
instability strip, the synchronization of layers, the mode selection and the
existence of a limit cycle for radially pulsating stars. Methods. We describe
the RR Lyrae type pulsating stars as a system of coupled nonlinear oscillators.
Considering a spatial discretisation of the star, supposing a spherical
symmetry, we develop the equation of motion and energy up to the third order in
the radial and adiabatic case. Then, we include the influence of the ionization
region as a relaxation oscillator by including elements from synchronisation
theory. Results. This discrete approach allows us to exploit existing results
in the coupled nonlinear oscillator field. For instance, the study of
synchronicity leads to an explanation of the mode selection, the layers
synchronisation, the limit cycle and the red limit of the instability strip.
But, most of all, the analogy with the Fermi-Pasta-Ulam (FPU) experiment
enables us to understand the Blazhko effect. The transfer of energy between
different modes, as induced by solitons, not only gives a plausible theory for
lightcurve modulation, but also explains the asymmetry of sidelobes.

ICM/IGM linkage. In this paper we consider potential future observations in the
gamma-ray domain at cluster edges involving the radio relic phenomenon.
  We focus on the spectral signature of gamma radiation that should be evident
in the energy range of Fermi--LAT, i.e. $\gtrsim 10^{-1}$ GeV and the CTA
energy range $\sim$ $ 10^{2}$ GeV. The spectral signature results from a
comparable gamma-ray flux due to the IC and $ \pi ^{0} $ decay on the edge of
the cluster, and its spectral position is a function of the magnetic field and
relative efficiency of the acceleration of protons and electrons. We aim to
draw attention to the dependence of the gamma-ray structure on the magnetic
field value.
  As an example, we carried out analyses of two types of non-thermal diffuse
radio emission: the radio relic of A 2256 and the radio halo of Coma cluster.
We suggest that in both cases the expected spatially correlated gamma-ray
spectrum should have a characteristic structure that depends on the strength of
the local magnetic field. In both of the clusters we calculated the combined
flux of gamma radiation from the actual observational values of the used
observables.
  The revealed spectral dependence on the magnetic field would allow us to
relate the future spectral observations, in particular the position of the
gamma-ray signature, to the value of the magnetic field in the border area
between galaxy clusters and their connecting filaments, possibly constraining
the estimated relative efficiency of particle acceleration at the edge of the
cluster.
