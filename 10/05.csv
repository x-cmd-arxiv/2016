recent interest. A typical approach involves sparsely representing patches in a
low-resolution (LR) input image via a dictionary of example LR patches, and
then using the coefficients of this representation to generate the
high-resolution (HR) output via an analogous HR dictionary. However, most
existing sparse representation methods for super resolution focus on the
luminance channel information and do not capture interactions between color
channels. In this work, we extend sparsity based super-resolution to multiple
color channels by taking color information into account. Edge similarities
amongst RGB color bands are exploited as cross channel correlation constraints.
These additional constraints lead to a new optimization problem which is not
easily solvable; however, a tractable solution is proposed to solve it
efficiently. Moreover, to fully exploit the complementary information among
color channels, a dictionary learning method is also proposed specifically to
learn color dictionaries that encourage edge similarities. Merits of the
proposed method over state of the art are demonstrated both visually and
quantitatively using image quality metrics.

several interesting quantum characteristics which are not amenable to classical
explanations. The monogamy property imposes physical restrictions on
unconditional sharability of quantum correlations between the different parts

cooperative properties of states of multiparty systems, including large
many-body systems. On the contrary, a certain party can be maximally classical
correlated with an arbitrary number of parties in a multiparty system. In

quantum biology. In this chapter, we look at some of the salient developments

due to strongly coupled phenomena across multiple scales. In this work, we
propose a wavelet-based coarse-grained numerical scheme, based on the framework
of Equation-Free Projective Integration, for a kinetic plasma system modeled by
the Vlasov-Poisson equations. A kinetic particle-in-cell (PIC) code is used to
simulate the meso scale dynamics for short time intervals. This allows the
extrapolation over long time-steps of the behavior of a coarse wavelet-based
discretization of the system. To validate the approach and the underlying
concepts, we perform two 1D1V numerical experiments: nonlinear propagation and
steepening of an ion wave, and the expansion of a plasma slab in vacuum. The
direct comparisons to resolved PIC simulations show good agreement. We show
that the speedup of the projective integration scheme over the full particle
scheme scales linearly with the system size, demonstrating efficiency while
taking into account fully kinetic, non-Maxwellian effects. This suggests that
the approach is potentially interesting for kinetic plasma problems with a
large separation of scales, especially in higher dimensions.

(1) pair-instability supernovae (PISN), (2) magnetar-driven supernovae, and (3)
models in which the supernova ejecta interacts with a circumstellar material
ejected before the explosion. Based on current observations of SLSNe, the PISN
origin has been disfavoured for a number of reasons. Many PISN models provide
overly broad light curves and too reddened spectra, because of massive ejecta
and a high amount of nickel. In the current study we re-examine PISN properties
using progenitor models computed with the GENEC code. We calculate supernova
explosions with FLASH and light curve evolution with the radiation
hydrodynamics code STELLA. We find that high-mass models (200 and 250 solar
masses) at relatively high metallicity (Z=0.001) do not retain hydrogen in the
outer layers and produce relatively fast evolving PISNe Type I and might be
suitable to explain some SLSNe. We also investigate uncertainties in light
curve modelling due to codes, opacities, the nickel-bubble effect and
progenitor structure and composition.

particularly interesting because it specifically probes the inelastic
interactions that break the conductance quantization for a single edge. Using
the kinetic equation formalism, supplemented by bosonization, we find that the
drag resistivity $\rho_D$ exhibits a nonmonotonic dependence on the temperature
$T$. In the limit of low $T$, $\rho_D$ vanishes with decreasing $T$ as a power

Coulomb drag in conventional quantum wires, where $\rho_D$ diverges at $T\to 0$

property of Coulomb drag between the helical edges concerns higher $T$ for
which, unlike in the Luttinger liquid model, drag is mediated by plasmons. The

d-wave superconductivity ($d$SC), \emph{d}-form factor density wave ($d$FF-DW),
and extended s-wave pair density wave ($s'$PDW), we find agreement with this

variability of the gap structure with changes in band structure and density
wave (DW) wave vector, thus explaining why sub-gap structures may not be a
universal feature in cuprates. In the absence of nesting, non-superconducting
results never show signs of pseudogap, even for large density waves magnitudes,
therefore reinforcing the idea of a distinct origin for the pseudogap, beyond
mean-field theory. Therefore, we also briefly consider the effect of DWs on a
pre-existing pseudogap.

general-purpose neural network policies with minimal human engineering, while
still allowing for fast, efficient learning in stochastic environments. Our
approach builds on the guided policy search (GPS) algorithm, which transforms
the reinforcement learning problem into supervised learning from a
computational teacher (without human demonstrations). In contrast to prior GPS
methods, which require a consistent set of initial states to which the system
must be reset after each episode, our approach can handle randomized initial
states, allowing it to be used in environments where deterministic resets are
impossible. We compare our method to existing policy search techniques in

with the same sample efficiency as prior GPS methods, and present real-world

an inherent trade-off between productivity, yield, and titer. Existing
strategies for strain design typically focus on designing mutations that
achieve the highest yield possible while maintaining growth viability. While
these methods are computationally tractable, an optimum productivity could be
achieved by a dynamic strategy in which the intracellular division of resources
is permitted to change with time. New methods for the design and implementation
of dynamic microbial processes, both computational and experimental, have
therefore been explored to maximize productivity. However, solving for the
optimal metabolic behavior under the assumption that all fluxes in the cell are
free to vary is a challenging numerical task. This work presents an efficient
method for the calculation of a maximum theoretical productivity of a batch
culture system using a dynamic optimization framework. This metric is analogous
to the maximum theoretical yield, a measure that is well established in the
metabolic engineering literature and whose use helps guide strain and pathway
selection. The proposed method follows traditional assumptions of dynamic flux
balance analysis: (1) that internal metabolite fluxes are governed by a
pseudo-steady state, and (2) that external metabolite fluxes are dynamically
bounded. The optimization is achieved via collocation on finite elements, and
accounts explicitly for an arbitrary number of flux changes. The method can be
further extended to explicitly solve for the trade-off curve between maximum
productivity and yield. We demonstrate the method on succinate production in
two common microbial hosts, Escherichia coli and Actinobacillus succinogenes,
revealing that nearly optimal yields and productivities can be achieved with
only two discrete flux stages.

with many strongly-coupled immersed-boundary methods, our method requires the
solution of a nonlinear algebraic system at each time step. The system is
solved through iteration, where the iterates are obtained by linearizing the

to small-dimensional subsystems that scale with the number of discretization
points on the immersed surface, rather than on the entire flow domain.
Moreover, the iteration procedure we propose does not involve heuristic
regularization parameters, and has converged in a small number of iterations
for all problems we have considered. We derive our method for general deforming
surfaces, and verify the method with two-dimensional test problems of
geometrically nonlinear beams undergoing large amplitude flapping behavior.

This model helps to better estimate the bundle diameter which results in a more

recognition, partially due to these recent large-scale scene datasets, such as

information, including local objects, global layout, and background
environment, thus leading to large intra-class variations. In addition, with
the increasing number of scene categories, label ambiguity has become another
crucial issue in large-scale classification. This paper focuses on large-scale
scene recognition and makes two major contributions to tackle these issues.
First, we propose a multi-resolution CNN architecture that captures visual
content and structure at multiple levels. The multi-resolution CNNs are
composed of coarse resolution CNNs and fine resolution CNNs, which are
complementary to each other. Second, we design two knowledge guided
disambiguation techniques to deal with the problem of label ambiguity. (i) We
exploit the knowledge from the confusion matrix computed on validation data to
merge ambiguous classes into a super category. (ii) We utilize the knowledge of
extra networks to produce a soft label for each image. Then the super
categories or soft labels are employed to guide CNN training on the Places2. We
conduct extensive experiments on three large-scale image datasets (ImageNet,
Places, and Places2), demonstrating the effectiveness of our approach.
Furthermore, our method takes part in two major scene recognition challenges,
and achieves the second place at the Places2 challenge in ILSVRC 2015, and the
first place at the LSUN challenge in CVPR 2016. Finally, we directly test the
learned representations on other scene benchmarks, and obtain the new

physical, chemical, biological, and engineering processes. The detection of
transport barriers for dynamics with general time dependence is a difficult,
but important problem, because such barriers control how rapidly different
parts of phase space (which might correspond to different chemical or
biological agents) interact. The key factor is the growth of interfaces that
partition phase space into separate regions. The paper [Froyland, Nonlinearity
2015] introduced the notion of \textit{dynamic isoperimetry}: the study of sets
with persistently small boundary size (the interface) relative to enclosed
volume, when evolved by the dynamics. Sets with this minimal boundary size to
volume ratio were identified as level sets of dominant eigenfunctions of a
\textit{dynamic Laplace operator}.
  In this present work we extend the results of [Froyland, Nonlinearity 2015]
to the situation where the dynamics (i) is not necessarily volume-preserving,
(ii) acts on initial agent concentrations different from uniform
concentrations, and (iii) occurs on a possibly curved phase space. Our main
results include generalised versions of the dynamic isoperimetric problem, the
dynamic Laplacian, Cheeger's inequality, and the Federer-Fleming theorem. We
illustrate the computational approach with some simple numerical examples.

testing numerical code. The key idea is to (1) capture the desired testing
objective via a representing function and (2) transform the automated testing
problem to the minimization problem of the representing function. The
minimization problem is to be solved via mathematical optimization. The main
feature of ME is that it directs input space exploration by only executing the
representing function, thus avoiding static or symbolic reasoning about the
program semantics, which is particularly challenging for numerical code. To
illustrate this feature, we develop an ME-based algorithm for coverage-based
testing of numerical code. We also show the potential of applying and adapting
ME to other related problems, including path reachability testing, boundary
value analysis, and satisfiability checking.
  To demonstrate ME's practical benefits, we have implemented CoverMe, a
proof-of-concept realization for branch coverage based testing, and evaluated
it on Sun's C math library (used in, for example, Android, Matlab, Java and
JavaScript). We have compared CoverMe with random testing and Austin, a
publicly available branch coverage based testing tool that supports numerical
code (Austin combines symbolic execution and search-based heuristics). Our
experimental results show that CoverMe achieves near-optimal and substantially
higher coverage ratios than random testing on all tested programs, across all
evaluated coverage metrics. Compared with Austin, CoverMe improves branch
coverage from 43% to 91%, with significantly less time (6.9 vs. 6058.4 seconds

quantum phenomena in terms of point particles whose motion is guided by the
wave function. In this theory, the state of a system of particles is defined by
the actual positions of the particles and the wave function of the system; and
the state of the system evolves deterministically. Thus, the Bohmian state can
be compared with the state in classical mechanics, which is given by the
positions and momenta of all the particles, and which also evolves
deterministically. However, while in classical mechanics it is usually taken
for granted and considered unproblematic that the state is, at least in
principle, measurable, this is not the case in Bohmian mechanics. Due to the
linearity of the quantum dynamical laws, one essential component of the Bohmian
state, the wave function, is not directly measurable. Moreover, it turns out
that the measurement of the other component of the state -the positions of the
particles- must be mediated by the wave function; a fact that in turn implies
that the positions of the particles, though measurable, are constrained by
absolute uncertainty. This is the key to understanding how Bohmian mechanics,
despite being deterministic, can account for all quantum predictions, including
quantum randomness and uncertainty.

optical spectra which cover multiple pulsation cycles of $o$ Cet. The submm
ALMA data reveal TiO and TiO$_2$ bearing gas within the extended atmosphere of

TiO$_2$ extends as far as 5.5 R$_{\star}$ and unlike TiO appears to be
anisotropically distributed. Optical spectra display variable emission of TiI

models which include shocks are in general agreement with the observations of
gas-phase titanium-bearing molecules. It is unlikely that substantial amounts
of titanium is locked up in solids because the abundance of the gaseous
titanium species is very high. In particular, formation of hot titanium-rich
condensates is very improbable because we find no traces of their hot precursor

is discussed in this paper via their interactions with astroparticles in the
presence or absence of background fields such as magnetic fields and
non-commutative space time geometry. Solving quantum Boltzmann equation for
GRB-photons as a photon ensemble, we discuss the generation of circular
polarization (as Faraday conversion phase shift $\Delta \phi_{FC}$) of GRBs in
the following cases: (i) intermediate interactions, i.e. the Compton scattering
of GRBs in the galaxy cluster magnetic field and in the presence of
non-commutative space time geometry, as well as the scattering of GRBs in
cosmic neutrino background (CNB), and in cosmic microwave background (CMB);
(ii) interactions with particles and fields in shock wave, i.e. the Compton
scattering of GRBs with accelerated charged particles in the presence of
magnetic fields. We found that (i) after shock wave crossing, the most
contribution of $\Delta \phi_{FC}$ for energetic GRBs (in order GeV and larger)
comes from GRB-CMB interactions, however for low energy GRBs the contributions
of the Compton scattering of GRBs in the galaxy cluster magnetic field
dominate; (ii) in shock wave crossing, the magnetic filed has significant
effects on converting GRB's linear polarization to circular one, this effect
can be used to better understanding magnetic profile in shock wave. The main
aim of this work is a emphasis that the studying and measuring the circular

Way-type (MW-type) galaxy, we explore how a merger-rich assembly history
affects the mass budget of the central supermassive black hole (SMBH). We
examine a MW-mass halo at the present epoch whose evolution is characterized by
several major mergers to isolate the importance of merger history on black hole
accretion. This study is an extension of Bellovary et. al. 2013, which analyzed
the accretion of high mass, high redshift galaxies and their central black
holes, and found that the gas content of the central black hole reflects what
is accreted by the host galaxy halo. In this study, we find that a merger-rich
galaxy will have a central SMBH preferentially fed by merger gas. Moreover, we
find that nearly 30$\%$ of the accreted mass budget of the SMBH enters the
galaxy through the two major mergers in its history, which may account for the
increase of merger-gas fueling the SMBH. Through an investigation of the
angular momentum of the gas entering the host and its SMBH, we determine that
merger gas enters the galaxy with lower angular momentum compared to smooth
accretion, partially accounting for the preferential fueling witnessed in the
SMBH. In addition, the presence of mergers, particularly major mergers, also
helps funnel low angular momentum gas more readily to the center of the galaxy.
Our results imply that galaxy mergers play an important role in feeding the
SMBH in MW-type galaxies with merger-rich histories. Our results imply that

merger rate in the Illustris Simulations. To do so, we construct three 140
arcmin^2 lightcone catalogs and measure pair fractions, finding that they
change little or decrease with increasing redshift at z > 1. Consistent with
current surveys, this trend requires a decrease in the merger-pair
observability time, roughly as (1 + z)^-2, in order to measure the merger rates
of the same galaxies. This implies that major mergers are more common at high
redshift than implied by the simplest arguments assuming a constant
observability time. Several effects contribute to this trend: (1) The fraction
of massive, major (4:1) pairs which merge by today increases weakly from ~0.5
at z=1 to ~0.8 at z=3. (2) The median time elapsed between an observed pair and
final remnant decreases by a factor of two from z~1 to z~3. (3) An increasing
specific star formation rate (sSFR) decreases the time during which common
stellar-mass based pair selection criteria could identify the mergers. The
average orbit of the pairs at observation time varies only weakly, suggesting
that the dynamical time is not varying enough to account by itself for the pair
fraction trends. Merging pairs reside in dense regions, having overdensity ~10
to ~100 times greater than the average massive galaxy. We forward model the
pairs to reconstruct the merger remnant production rate, showing that it is
consistent with a rapid increase in galaxy merger rates at z > 1.

produced by quiescent mergers that inspiral into the galaxy and deposit high
angular momentum material into the pre-existing disc, simultaneously increasing
the spin of dark matter and gas in the halo. More violent mergers and strong
AGN feedback play roles in limiting disc size by destroying pre-existing discs
and by suppressing gas accretion onto the outer disc, respectively. The most
important factor that leads to compact discs, however, is simply a low angular
momentum for the halo. In these cases, AGN feedback plays an important role in
limiting central star formation and the formation of a massive bulge.

one needs to estimate the redshift distribution of lensed background sources.
This is commonly done in an empirical fashion, i.e. with a reference sample of
galaxies of known spectroscopic redshift, matched to the source population. In
this work, we develop a simple decision tree framework that, under the ideal
conditions of a large, purely magnitude-limited reference sample, allows an
unbiased recovery of the source redshift probability density function p(z), as
a function of magnitude and color. We use this framework to quantify biases in
empirically estimated p(z) caused by selection effects present in realistic
reference and weak lensing source catalogs, namely (1) complex selection of
reference objects by the targeting strategy and success rate of existing
spectroscopic surveys and (2) selection of background sources by the success of
object detection and shape measurement at low signal-to-noise. For
intermediate-to-high redshift clusters, and for depths and filter combinations
appropriate for ongoing lensing surveys, we find that (1) spectroscopic
selection can cause biases above the 10 per cent level, which can be reduced to
5 per cent by optimal lensing weighting, while (2) selection effects in the
shape catalog bias mass estimates at or below the 2 per cent level. This
illustrates the importance of completeness of the reference catalogs for
empirical redshift estimation.

important information about the build-up of the innermost regions of galaxies,
the physical processes that regulate their formation are still poorly
understood. NSCs might have been formed through gas infall and subsequent in
situ star formation, and/or through the infall and merging of multiple star
clusters into the centre of the galaxy. Here, we investigate the viability of
the latter, by studying direct N-body simulations of inspiralling clusters to
the centre of a Milky-Way-like nuclear bulge that hosts a massive black hole.
We find that the NSC that forms through this process can show both
morphological and kinematical properties that make it comparable with
observations of the Milky Way NSC, including significant rotation- a fact that
has been so far attributed mainly to gas infall. We explore its kinematic
evolution, to see if and how the merger history can imprint fossil records on
its dynamical structure. Moreover, we study the effect of stellar foreground
contamination in the line-of-sight kinematics of the NSC. Our study shows that
no fine tuning of the orientation of the infalling globular clusters is
necessary to result in a rotating NSC. We suggest that cluster-inspiral is a
viable mechanism for the formation of rotating NSCs.

apply it to a number of observational puzzles, including the large covering

ultra-short-period (USP) planets with orbital periods less than a day. These
planets typically have radii <1.5 Earth radii, indicating that they likely have
rocky compositions. This stands in contrast to the overall distribution of
planets out to ~100 days, which is dominated by low-density sub-Neptunes above
2 Earth radii, which must have gaseous envelopes to explain their size.
However, on ultra-short-period orbits, planets are bombarded by intense levels
of photo-ionizing radiation and consequently gaseous sub-Neptunes are extremely
vulnerable to losing their envelopes to atmospheric photo-evaporation. Using
models of planet evolution, I show that the rocky USP planets can easily be
produced as the evaporated remnants of sub-Neptunes with H/He envelopes and
that we can therefore understand the observed dearth of USP sub-Neptunes as a
natural consequence of photo-evaporation. Critically however, planets on USP
orbits could often retain their envelopes if they formed with very
high-metallicity water dominated envelopes. Such water-rich planets would
commonly be >2 Earth radii today, which is inconsistent with the observed

include non-Fermi liquids (NFL), fractional quantum Hall (FQH) states, nematic

the balance between the seemingly unrelated phases? The answer is elusive
because the Halperin-Lee-Read (HLR) description that offers a natural departure
point is inherent strongly coupled. But the observed nematic phases suggest
nematic fluctuations play an important role. To study this possibility, we
apply a recently formulated controlled double expansion approach in large-$N$
composite fermion flavors and small $\epsilon$ non-analytic bosonic action to
the case with both gauge and nematic boson fluctuations. In the vicinity of a
nematic quantum critical line (NQCL), we find that depending on the amount of
screening of the gauge- and nematic-mediated interactions controlled by
$\epsilon$'s, the RG flow points to all four mentioned correlated phases. When
pairing preempts the nematic phase, NFL behavior is possible at temperatures
above the pairing transition. We conclude by discussing measurements at low
tilt angles which could reveal the stabilization of the FQH phase by nematic
fluctuations.

galaxies and a SN sample of about 50 events. We found that the SN Ia rate per
unit mass is higher by a factor of six in the star-forming galaxies with
respect to the passive galaxies. The SN Ia rate per unit mass is also higher in
the less massive galaxies that are also younger. These results suggest a
distribution of the delay times (DTD) less populated at long delay times than
at short delays. The CC SN rate per unit mass is proportional to both the sSFR
and the galaxy mass. The trends of the Type Ia and CC SN rates as a function of
the sSFR and the galaxy mass that we observed from SUDARE data are in agreement
with literature results at different redshifts. The expected number of SNe Ia
is in agreement with the observed one for all four DTD models considered both
in passive and star-forming galaxies so we can not discriminate between
different progenitor scenarios. The expected number of CC SNe is higher than
the observed one, suggesting a higher limit for the minimum progenitor mass. We
also compare the expected and observed trends of the SN Ia rate with the
intrinsic U - J colour of the parent galaxy, assumed as a tracer of the age
distribution. While the slope of the relation between the SN Ia rate and the U
- J color in star-forming galaxies can be reproduced well by all four DTD
models considered, only the steepest of them is able to account for the rates
and colour in star-forming and passive galaxies with the same value of the SN

sizes that are governed by a balance between electrostatic and elastic forces.
Tuning of particle size by varying external stimuli, such as $p$H, salt
concentration, and temperature, has relevance for drug delivery, microfluidics,
and filtration. To model swelling of ionic microgels, we derive a statistical
mechanical theorem, which proves exact within the cell model, for the
electrostatic contribution to the osmotic pressure inside a permeable colloidal
macroion. Applying the theorem, we demonstrate how the distribution of
counterions within an ionic microgel determines the internal osmotic pressure.
By combining the electrostatic pressure, which we compute via both
Poisson-Boltzmann theory and molecular dynamics simulation, with the elastic
pressure, modeled via the Flory-Rehner theory of swollen polymer networks, we
show how deswelling of ionic microgels with increasing concentration of
particles can result from a redistribution of counterions that reduces
electrostatic pressure. A linearized approximation for the electrostatic
pressure, which proves remarkably accurate, provides physical insight and
greatly eases numerical calculations for practical applications. Comparing with
experiments, we explain why soft particles in deionized suspensions deswell
upon increasing concentration and why this effect may be suppressed at higher
ionic strength. The failure of the uniform ideal-gas approximation to
adequately account for counterion-induced deswelling below close packing of
microgels is attributed to neglect of spatial variation of the counterion
density profile and the electrostatic pressure of incompletely neutralized
macroions.

grows exponentially, dynamic partial-order reduction (DPOR) techniques have
been successfully used to partition the space of traces into equivalence
classes (Mazurkiewicz partitioning), with the goal of exploring only few
representative traces from each class.
  We introduce a new equivalence on traces under sequential consistency
semantics, which we call the observation equivalence. Two traces are
observationally equivalent if every read event observes the same write event in
both traces. While the traditional Mazurkiewicz equivalence is control-centric,
our new definition is data-centric. We show that our observation equivalence is
coarser than the Mazurkiewicz equivalence, and in many cases even exponentially
coarser. We devise a DPOR exploration of the trace space, called data-centric
DPOR, based on the observation equivalence. For acyclic architectures, our
algorithm is guaranteed to explore exactly one representative trace from each
observation class, while spending polynomial time per class. Hence, our
algorithm is optimal wrt the observation equivalence, and in several cases
explores exponentially fewer traces than any enumerative method based on the
Mazurkiewicz equivalence. For cyclic architectures, we consider an equivalence
between traces which is finer than the observation equivalence; but coarser
than the Mazurkiewicz equivalence, and in some cases is exponentially coarser.
Our data-centric DPOR algorithm remains optimal under this trace equivalence.

substantial advances in fluorescence-based imaging methodologies, labeling with
beads remains critical for optical-trapping-based investigations of molecular
motors. A key experimental challenge in bead-based assays is that the number of
motors on a bead is not well defined. Particularly for single-molecule
investigations, the probability of single versus multiple-motor events has not
been experimentally investigated. Here, we used bead travel distance as an
indicator of multiple-motor transport and determined the lower-bound
probability of bead transport by two or more motors. We limited the ATP
concentration to increase our detection sensitivity for multiple- versus
single-kinesin transport. Surprisingly, for all but the lowest motor number
examined, our measurements exceeded estimations of a previous model by R2-fold.
To bridge this apparent gap between theory and experiment, we derived a
closed-form expression for the probability of bead transport by multiple
motors, and constrained the only free parameter in this model using our
experimental measurements. Our data indicate that kinesin extends to ~57 nm
during bead transport, suggesting that kinesin exploits its conformational
flexibility to interact with microtubules at highly curved interfaces such as
those present for vesicle transport in cells. To our knowledge, our findings
provide the first experimentally constrained guide for estimating the
probability of multiple-motor transport in optical trapping studies. The
experimental approach utilized here (limiting ATP concentration) may be
generally applicable to studies in which molecular motors are labeled with

periphery; this transport is critical for the survival and health of all
eukaryotic cells. Structural defects in microtubules exist, but whether these
defects impact molecular motor-based transport remains unknown. Here, we report
a new, to our knowledge, approach that allowed us to directly investigate the
impact of such defects. Using a modified optical-trapping method, we examined
the group function of a major molecular motor, conventional kinesin, when
transporting cargos along individual microtubules. We found that microtubule
defects influence kinesin-based transport in vitro. The effects depend on motor
number: cargos driven by a few motors tended to unbind prematurely from the
microtubule, whereas cargos driven by more motors tended to pause. To our
knowledge, our study provides the first direct link between microtubule defects
and kinesin function. The effects uncovered in our study may have physiological
relevance in vivo.

Interestingly, the presence of tau also modestly reduced cargo velocity in

observations of regions towards the Galactic anticentre, re-analysing them to
obtain a single sample of 23 objects covering the Galactocentric radius from 11
kpc to 18 kpc to be processed in a homogeneous and consistent manner. Accurate
electron densities and temperatures of several ionic species were derived in 13
HII regions. These physical parameters were applied to the spectra to determine
direct total chemical abundances. For those regions without direct estimations
of temperature, chemical abundances were derived by performing tailor-made
photoionisation models and/or by using an empirical relation obtained from
radio recombination and optical temperatures.
  We performed weighted least-squares fits to the distribution of the derived
abundances along the Galactocentric distances to study the radial gradients of
metallicity. The distributions O/H, N/H, S/H, and Ar/H towards the anticentre
can be represented by decreasing linear radial gradients, while in the case of
N/O abundances the radial distribution is better fitted with a two-zone model.
The He/H radial gradient is presented here for the first time; we find a slope
that is not significantly different from zero. The derived gradient for oxygen
shows a clear decrease with distance with a slope of -0.053dex/kpc. Although a
shallower slope at large Galactocentric distances is suggested by our data, the
flattening of the distribution cannot be confirmed and more objects towards the
anticentre need to be studied in order to establish the true form of the

are missing not at random, the parameter of interest is not identifiable in
general. Without additional assumptions, we can derive bounds of the parameters
of interest, which, unfortunately, are often too wide to be informative.
Therefore, it is of great importance to sharpen these worst-case bounds by
exploiting additional information. Traditional missing data analysis uses only
the information of the binary missing data indicator, that is, a certain data
point is either missing or not. Nevertheless, real data often provide more
information than a binary missing data indicator, and they often record
different types of missingness. In a motivating HIV status survey, missing data
may be due to the units' unwillingness to respond to the survey items or their
hospitalization during the visit, and may also be due to the units' temporarily
absence or relocation. It is apparent that some missing types are more likely
to be missing not at random, but other missing types are more likely to be
missing at random. We show that making full use of the missing types results in
narrower bounds of the parameters of interest. In a real-life example, we
demonstrate substantial improvement of more than 50% reduction in bound widths
for estimating the prevalence of HIV in rural Malawi. As we illustrate using
the HIV study, our strategy is also useful for conducting sensitivity analysis
by gradually increasing or decreasing the set of types that are missing at
random. In addition, we propose an easy-to-implement method to construct
confidence intervals for partially identified parameters with bounds expressed

targeted pseudorandom generator against logspace takes as input a short uniform
random seed and a finite automaton; it outputs a long bitstring that looks
random to that particular automaton. A simulation advice generator for logspace
stretches a small uniform random seed into a long advice string; the

terrorism and the number of lethal terrorist attacks in both space and time.
Moreover, the frequency of lethal attacks tends to be higher in richer areas,
close to large cities, and within democratic countries. In contrast, attacks
are more likely to be lethal far away from large cities, at higher altitudes,
in poorer areas, and in locations with higher ethnic diversity. We argue that,
on a local scale, the lethality of terrorism and the frequency of lethal
attacks are driven by antagonistic mechanisms.

bridge between multiple levels of organization, including neural spiking and
network-level population activity. Mounting evidence suggests that neural
networks of cerebral cortex operate at criticality. How operating near this
network state impacts the variability of neuronal spiking is largely unknown.
Here we show in a computational model that two prevalent features of cortical
single-neuron activity, irregular spiking and the decline of response
variability at stimulus onset, are both emergent properties of a recurrent
network operating near criticality. Importantly, our work reveals that the
relation between the irregularity of spiking and the number of input
connections to a neuron, i.e., the in-degree, is maximized at criticality. Our
findings establish criticality as a unifying principle for the variability of
single-neuron spiking and the collective behavior of recurrent circuits in

piecewise linear behavior between integer electron numbers. Although paths to
correction of energetic delocalization error are well- established, the impact
of these corrections on the electron density is less well-studied. Here, we
compare the effect on density delocalization of DFT+U, global hybrid tuning,
and range- separated hybrid tuning on a diverse test set of 32 transition metal
complexes and observe the three methods to have qualitatively equivalent
effects on the ground state density. Regardless of valence orbital diffuseness

(i.e., plane wave versus localized basis set), metal (i.e., Ti, Fe, Ni) and
spin state, or tuning method, we consistently observe substantial charge loss
at the metal and gain at ligand atoms (ca. 0.3-0.5 e or more). This charge loss
at the metal is preferentially from the minority spin, leading to increasing
magnetic moment as well. Using accurate wavefunction theory references, we
observe that a minimum error in partial charges and magnetic moments occur at
higher tuning parameters than typically employed to eliminate energetic
delocalization error. These observations motivate the need to develop
multi-faceted approximate-DFT error correction approaches that separately treat
density delocalization and energetic errors in order to recover both correct
density and magnetization properties.

prosodic and other hand crafted speech processing features extracted with
off-the-shelf toolboxes. To achieve high accuracy, numerous features are
typically extracted using complex and highly parameterized algorithms. In this
paper, a new method based on feature learning and spectrogram analysis is
proposed to simplify the feature extraction process while maintaining a high
level of accuracy. The proposed method learns a dictionary of discriminant
features from patches extracted in the spectrogram representations of training
speech segments. Each speech segment is then encoded using the dictionary, and
the resulting feature set is used to perform classification of personality
traits. Experiments indicate that the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art
results with a significant reduction in complexity when compared to the most
recent reference methods. The number of features, and difficulties linked to
the feature extraction process are greatly reduced as only one type of
descriptors is used, for which the 6 parameters can be tuned automatically. In
contrast, the simplest reference method uses 4 types of descriptors to which 6
functionals are applied, resulting in over 20 parameters to be tuned.

Here we give bounds on the errors in the estimation of the mean and covariance

estimation. This is the first time that such a result has been derived. The
result shows to what extent the state estimation must constrain the analysis in

the disk could act as migration traps and locations for solid material
accumulation, favoring the formation of massive cores. We aim to study the
radial drift of pebbles and planetesimals and planet migration at pressure
maxima in a protoplanetary disk and their implications for the formation of
massive cores as triggering a gaseous runaway accretion phase. The time
evolution of a viscosity driven accretion disk is solved numerically
introducing a a dead zone as a low-viscosity region in the protoplanetary disk.
A population of pebbles and planetesimals evolving by radial drift and
accretion by the planets is also considered. Finally, the embryos embedded in

surrounding gas. Our simulations show that the pressure maxima generated at the
edges of the low-viscosity region of the disk act as planet migration traps,
and that the pebble and planetesimal surface densities are significantly
increased due to the radial drift towards pressure maxima locations. However,
our simulations also show that migration trap locations and solid material
accumulation locations are not exactly at the same positions. Thus, a planet's
semi-major axis oscillations around zero torque locations, predicted by MHD and
HD simulations, are needed for the planet to accrete all the available material
accumulated at the pressure maxima. Pressure maxima generated at the edges of a
low-viscosity region of a protoplanetary disk seem to be preferential locations

law and Smarr formula, we derive a generalized first law from the Lagrangian of
nonlinear gauge field coupled to gravity. In our treatment, the Lagrangian is a
function of the electromagnetic invariant as well as some additional
parameters. Consequently, we obtain new terms in the first law. With our
formula, we find the correct forms of the first law for Bardeen black holes and
Born-Infeld black holes. By scaling arguments, we also derive a general Smarr

in images with the goal of autonomous driving in complex urban environments.
Using recorded routes from a data collection vehicle, our proposed method
generates vast quantities of labelled images containing proposed paths and
obstacles without requiring manual annotation, which we then use to train a
deep semantic segmentation network. With the trained network we can segment
proposed paths and obstacles at run-time using a vehicle equipped with only a
monocular camera without relying on explicit modelling of road or lane
markings. We evaluate our method on the large-scale KITTI and Oxford RobotCar
datasets and demonstrate reliable path proposal and obstacle segmentation in a
wide variety of environments under a range of lighting, weather and traffic
conditions. We illustrate how the method can generalise to multiple path
proposals at intersections and outline plans to incorporate the system into a
framework for autonomous urban driving.

  Detection",,,,,"cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Beyond its highly publicized victories in Go, there have been numerous
successful applications of deep learning in information retrieval, computer
vision and speech recognition. In cybersecurity, an increasing number of
companies have become excited about the potential of deep learning, and have
started to use it for various security incidents, the most popular being
malware detection. These companies assert that deep learning (DL) could help
turn the tide in the battle against malware infections. However, deep neural
networks (DNNs) are vulnerable to adversarial samples, a flaw that plagues most
if not all statistical learning models. Recent research has demonstrated that
those with malicious intent can easily circumvent deep learning-powered malware
detection by exploiting this flaw.
  In order to address this problem, previous work has developed various defense
mechanisms that either augmenting training data or enhance model's complexity.
However, after a thorough analysis of the fundamental flaw in DNNs, we discover
that the effectiveness of current defenses is limited and, more importantly,
cannot provide theoretical guarantees as to their robustness against
adversarial sampled-based attacks. As such, we propose a new adversary
resistant technique that obstructs attackers from constructing impactful
adversarial samples by randomly nullifying features within samples. In this
work, we evaluate our proposed technique against a real world dataset with
14,679 malware variants and 17,399 benign programs. We theoretically validate
the robustness of our technique, and empirically show that our technique
significantly boosts DNN robustness to adversarial samples while maintaining
high accuracy in classification. To demonstrate the general applicability of
our proposed method, we also conduct experiments using the MNIST and CIFAR-10
datasets, generally used in image recognition research.

$V_{ij}\propto\left|i-j\right|^{-\alpha}$, where the exponent of the

exact diagonalization, we calculate the half-chain entanglement entropy and the
energy spectral statistics and use them to characterize the phase transition
towards the many-body localization phase at infinite temperature and at
sufficiently large disorder strength. We perform finite-size scaling to extract
the critical disorder strength and the critical exponent of the divergent
localization length. With increasing $\alpha$, the critical exponent
experiences a sharp increase at about $\alpha=1$ and then gradually decreases
to a value found earlier in a disordered short-ranged interacting spin chain.
For $\alpha<1$, we find that the system is mostly localized and the increase in
the disorder strength may drive a transition between two many-body localized
phases. In contrast, for $\alpha>1$, the transition is from a thermalized phase
to the many-body localization phase. Our predictions could be experimentally
tested with ion-trap quantum emulator with programmable random long-range
interactions, or with randomly distributed Rydberg atoms or polar molecules in

This can lead to large vacuum radiation pressure fluctuations on charged or

time averaging of the stress tensor operator, which might be determined by
factors such as the shape of the potential. We make some estimates for the rate

to the polynomials. We prove an explicit formula for $\Psi_{0}$ in terms of
Krawtchouk polynomials for the Gelfand pair
$(\mathrm{SU}(2)\times\mathrm{SU}(2),\mathrm{diag}(\mathrm{SU}(2)))$. For the
matrix-valued orthogonal polynomials associated to this pair, a deformation was
already available by different methods and we show that our method gives same
results using explicit knowledge of $\Psi_{0}$.
  Furthermore we apply our method to some of the examples of size $2\times2$
for more general Gelfand pairs. We prove that the families related to the
groups $\mathrm{SU}(n)$ are deformations of one another. On the other hand, the
families associated to the symplectic groups $\mathrm{Sp}(n)$ give rise to a
new family with an extra free parameter.

the inflationary correlators are computed by conformal perturbation theory. In

compute the full inflationary bispectra from the deformed CFT correlators. We
also discuss the squeezed limit of the bispectra from the viewpoint of operator

our power spectrum is blue tilted in the UV region. We extend our bispectrum
computation to the IR region by resumming the conformal perturbations to all

When there are conserved quantities, a representation of the entire Hilbert
space is not necessary. The same issue arises when conditional observations are
made with post-selected measurement results. In these cases, only a part of the
Hilbert space needs to be represented, and one can define this restriction by
way of a projection operator. Here coherent state bases and normally-ordered
phase-space representations are introduced for treating such projected Hilbert
spaces, including existence theorems and dynamical equations. These techniques
are very useful in studying novel optical or microwave integrated photonic
quantum technologies, such as boson sampling or Josephson quantum computers. In
these cases states become strongly restricted due to inputs, nonlinearities or
conditional measurements. This paper focuses on coherent phase states, which
have especially simple properties. Practical applications are reported on
calculating recurrences in anharmonic oscillators, the effects of arbitrary
phase-noise on Schrodinger cat fringe visibility, and on boson sampling
interferometry for large numbers of modes.

equation added an external noise and derives a stochastically perturbed mass
conserving mean curvature flow in the limit. The stochastic term destroys the
precise conservation law, instead the total mass changes like a Brownian motion
in time. For our equation, the comparison argument does not work, so that to
study the limit we adopt the asymptotic expansion method, which extends that
for deterministic equations used in Chen et al. [3]. Differently from the
deterministic case, each term except the leading term appearing in the
expansion of the solution in a small parameter $\epsilon$ diverges as
$\epsilon$ tends to $0$, since our equation contains the noise which converges
to a white noise and the products or the powers of the white noise diverge. To
derive the error estimate for our asymptotic expansion, we need to establish
the Schauder estimate for a diffusion operator with coefficients determined
from higher order derivatives of the noise and their powers. We show that one
can choose the noise sufficiently mild in such a manner that it converges to
the white noise and at the same time its diverging speed is slow enough for
establishing a necessary error estimate.

scaling of the algorithms. It is shown that, for a specific problem and model,
the RKL2 method is comparable or surpasses the implicit method with PCG solvers
in performance and scaling, but suffers from some accuracy limitations. These

striking precision, made possible by the modern technologies of the newest
generations of telescopes. The standard cosmological model, however, is not
absent of theoretical problems and open questions. One possibility that has
been put forward is the existence of a coupling between dark sectors. The idea
of an interaction between the dark components could help physicists understand
why we live in an epoch of the universe where dark matter and dark energy are
comparable in terms of energy density, which can be regarded as a coincidence
given that their time evolutions are completely different.
  We introduce the interaction phenomenologically and proceed to test models of
interaction with observations of redshift-space distortions. In a flat universe
composed only of those two fluids, we consider separately two forms of
interaction, through terms proportional to the densities of both dark energy
and dark matter. An analytic expression for the growth rate approximated as $f
= \Omega_{\mathrm{DM}}^{\gamma}$, where $\Omega_{\mathrm{DM}}$ is the
percentage contribution from the dark matter to the content of the universe and
$\gamma$ is the growth index, is derived in terms of the interaction strength
and of other parameters of the model in the first case, while for the second
model we show that a non-zero interaction cannot be accommodated by the index
growth approximation. The successful expressions obtained are then used to
compare the predictions with growth of structure observational data in a MCMC
code.
  We also employ observations of galaxy clusters to assess their virial state
via the modified Layzer-Irvine equation in order to detect signs of an
interaction, obtaining measurements of observed virial ratios, interaction
strength, rest virial ratio and departure from equilibrium for a set of
clusters. [abridged]

Here we use spin-polarised inelastic neutron scattering to show that collective

possess nearly no in-plane component. Such spin-space anisotropy can only be
caused by SOC. It is present over an energy range greater than the

with the specific Modified gravity theory known as MOG in the relevant
literature. MOG is an alternative theory for addressing the dark matter problem
without invoking exotic dark matter particles, and possesses two free
parameters $\alpha$ and $\mu_0$ in the weak field limit. We derive the
equilibrium gravitational potential of the Maclaurin disk in MOG and develop a
semi-analytic method for studying the response of the disk to linear
non-axysymmetric perturbations. The eigenvalue spectrum of the normal modes of
the disk is obtained and its physical meaning has been explored. We show that
Maclaurin disks are less stable in MOG than in Newtonian gravity. In fact both
parameters $(\alpha,\mu_0)$ have destabilizing effects on the disk.
Interestingly $\mu_0$ excites only the bar mode $m=2$ while $\alpha$ affects
all the modes. More specifically, when $\alpha>1$, the bar mode is strongly
unstable and unlike in Newtonian gravity can not be avoided, at least in the
weak field limit, with increasing the pressure support of the disk.

wishes to communicate with a receiver, Bob, over a channel controlled by an
adversarial jammer, James, who is {\em myopic}. Roughly speaking, for
blocklength $n$, the codeword $X^n$ transmitted by Alice is corrupted by James
who must base his adversarial decisions (of which locations of $X^n$ to corrupt
and how to corrupt them) not on the codeword $X^n$ but on $Z^n$, an image of
$X^n$ through a noisy memoryless channel. More specifically, our communication
model may be described by two channels. A memoryless channel $p(z|x)$ from
Alice to James, and an {\it Arbitrarily Varying Channel} from Alice to Bob,
$p(y|x,s)$ governed by a state $X^n$ determined by James. In standard
adversarial channels the states $S^n$ may depend on the codeword $X^n$, but in
our setting $S^n$ depends only on James's view $Z^n$.
  The myopic channel captures a broad range of channels and bridges between the
standard models of memoryless and adversarial (zero-error) channels. In this
work we present upper and lower bounds on the capacity of myopic channels. For
a number of special cases of interest we show that our bounds are tight. We
extend our results to the setting of {\em secure} communication in which we
require that the transmitted message remain secret from James. For example, we
show that if (i) James may flip at most a $p$ fraction of the bits communicated
between Alice and Bob, and (ii) James views $X^n$ through a binary symmetric
channel with parameter $q$, then once James is ""sufficiently myopic"" (in this
case, when $q>p$), then the optimal communication rate is that of an adversary
who is ""blind"" (that is, an adversary that does not see $X^n$ at all), which is
$1-H(p)$ for standard communication, and $H(q)-H(p)$ for secure communication.
A similar phenomenon exists for our general model of communication.

full coexistence between secondary users (SUs) and primary users (PUs).
Although using such cross-layer techniques have a great impact on the quality

the data over. Thus, the available spectrum is not utilized efficiently. In
this work, we propose CSCR, a channel selection scheme for cooperation-based

utilization through integrating the channels selection in the route discovery
phase of the cooperation-based routing protocols. The best channels, that are
less congested with primary users and that lead to minimum switching overhead,
are chosen while constructing the cooperative group. Evaluating CSCR via NS2

is decentralized in the sense that each agent utilizes information associated
with its own and the object's dynamic/kinematic parameters and no on-line
communication takes place. Moreover, no feedback of the contact forces/torques
is required, therefore employment of corresponding sensors is avoided. An
adaptive version of the control scheme is also introduced, where the agents'
and object's dynamic parameters are considered unknown. We also use unit
quaternions to represent the object's orientation. In addition, load sharing
coefficients between the agents are employed and internal force regulation is
guaranteed. Finally, experimental studies with two robotic arms verify the
validity and effectiveness of the proposed control protocol.

term is considered: (i) the weakly bounded potential and (ii) the double vacuum
potential. In the absence of the gauge interaction in the former case the
individual constituents of the multisoliton configuration are well separated,
while in the latter case the rotational invariance of the configuration remains
unbroken. It is shown that coupling of the planar multi-Skyrmions to the
electric and magnetic field strongly affects the pattern of interaction between
the constituents. We analyze the dependency of the structure of the solutions,
the energies, angular momenta, electric and magnetic fields of the
configurations on the gauge coupling constant $g$, and the electric potential.
It is found that, generically, the coupling to the Chern-Simons term strongly
affects the usual pattern of interaction between the skyrmions, in particular
the electric repulsion between the solitons may break the multisoliton
configuration into partons. We show that as the gauge coupling becomes strong,
both the magnetic flux and the electric charge of the solutions become
quantized although they are not topological numbers.

propose a mean-field matrix-analytic method in the study of bike-sharing
systems through combining the mean-field theory with the time-inhomogeneous

Secondly, we apply the mean-field theory to establishing a time-inhomogeneous

equations. Thirdly, we use the martingale limit theory to show the asymptotic
independence of this bike-sharing system, and further analyze the limiting
interchangeability as N goes to infinity and t goes to infinity. Based on this,
we discuss and compute the fixed point in terms of a nonlinear QBD process.
Finally, we analyze performance measures of this bike-sharing system, such as,
the mean of stationary bike number at any station and the stationary
probability of problematic stations. Furthermore, we use numerical examples to
show how the performance measures depend on the key parameters of this

(5-37 $\mu$m) with spatial resolutions of 2-4"". The spectra were inverted to
map the zonal-mean temperature and para-H$_2$ distribution ($f_p$, the fraction
of the para spin isomer with respect to the ortho spin isomer) in Jupiter's
upper troposphere (the 100-700 mbar range). We compared these to a reanalysis
of Voyager-1 and -2 IRIS spectra covering the same spectral range. Para-H$_2$
increases from equator to pole, with low-$f_p$ air at the equator representing
sub-equilibrium conditions (i.e., less para-H$_2$ than expected from thermal
equilibration), and high-$f_p$ air and possible super-equilibrium at higher
latitudes. In particular, we confirm the continued presence of a region of
high-$f_p$ air at high northern latitudes discovered by Voyager/IRIS, and an
asymmetry with generally higher $f_p$ in the north than in the south. We note
that existing collision-induced absorption databases lack opacity from
(H$_2$)$_2$ dimers, leading to under-prediction of the absorption near the S(0)

and tropospheric ammonia, phosphine and cloud opacity derived from Voyager/IRIS

tracks the similar latitudinal distribution of aerosols within Jupiter's upper
tropospheric and stratospheric hazes observed in reflected sunlight, suggesting
that catalysis of hydrogen equilibration within the hazes (and not the main
clouds) may govern the equator-to-pole gradient. [Abridged]

functions such as logistic function due to squashing effect. The sigmoid curves

evolution. How to understand the underlying rationale of the fractal dimension
curves is a pending problem. This study is based on two previous findings.
First, normalized fractal dimension proved to equal normalized spatial entropy;
second, a sigmoid function proceeds from an urban-rural interaction model.
Defining urban space-filling measurement by spatial entropy, and defining rural
space-filling measurement by information gain, we can construct a new
urban-rural interaction and coupling model. From this model, we can derive the
logistic equation of fractal dimension growth strictly. This indicates that
urban growth results from the unity of opposites between spatial entropy
increase and information increase. In a city, an increase in spatial entropy is
accompanied by a decrease in urban land availability. An inference is that
urban growth struggles between the force of urban space-filling and the force
of urban space-saving. This work presents a set of urban models of spatial
dynamics, which help us understand urban evolution from the angle of view of
entropy and fractals.

strength and resistance to both thermal and chemical stresses. However,
graphene as a bulk material has the tendency to form irreversible agglomerates

novel nanoporous graphite formed by graphtriyne sheets is introduced: its 3D
structure is theoretically assessed by means of electronic structure and
molecular dynamics computations within the DFT level of theory. It is found
that the novel layered carbon allotrope is almost as compact as pristine
graphite but the inherent porosity of the 2D graphyne sheets and its relative
stacking leads to nanochannels that cross the material and whose sub-nanometer
size could allow the diffusion and storage of gas species. A molecular
prototype of the nanochannel is used to accurately determine first principles
adsorption energies and enthalpies for CO2, N2, H2O and H2 within the pores.
The proposed porous graphite presents no significant barrier for gas diffusion
and it shows a high propensity for CO2 physisorption with respect to the other
relevant components in both pre- and post-combustion gas streams.

unconventional states of matter, directly in real space, and triggered a wealth
of studies at the frontier between nanomagnetism, statistical thermodynamics
and condensed matter physics. Despite the strong efforts made these last ten
years to provide an artificial realization of the celebrated square ice model,
no simple geometry based on arrays of nanomagnets succeeded to capture the
macroscopically degenerate ground state manifold of the corresponding model.
Instead, in all works reported so far, square lattices of nanomagnets are
characterized by a magnetically ordered ground state consisting of local
flux-closure configurations with alternating chirality. Here, we show
experimentally and theoretically, that all the characteristics of the square
ice model can be observed if the artificial square lattice is properly
designed. The spin configurations we image after demagnetizing our arrays
reveal unambiguous signatures of an algebraic spin liquid state characterized
by the presence of pinch points in the associated magnetic structure factor.
Local excitations, i.e. classical analogues of magnetic monopoles, are found to
be free to evolve in a massively degenerated, divergence-free vacuum. We thus

and establishing the necessary intermediate results, we extract explicit

self-interaction of the scalar on AdS$_4$ for the type A minimal bosonic
higher-spin theory from the three- and four- point correlation functions of
single-trace operators in the free scalar $O\left(N\right)$ vector model. For
this purpose tools were developed to evaluate tree-level three-point Witten
diagrams involving fields of arbitrary integer spin and the conformal partial
wave expansions of tree-level four-point Witten diagrams, which are underpinned
by the ambient space formulation of AdS space and CFT. We also discuss the
implications of the holographic duality on the locality properties of

superplasticity (SP) in deformed materials. It is shown that a non-linear, wave
plastic deformation is the basic process for all plastic deformation phenomena,
it makes an individual contribution into these phenomena, allows describing
them from the same standpoints, and offers a way to follow the relationship
between the physics of defects and the mechanics of plasticity. It is to be
noted that macro and meso defects - discontinuities in the vector fields of
macro and meso elastic displacements, are no less fundamental than are the
microdefects - dislocations and disclinations, it is the latter which form the
process of localized macrodeformation. General mechanisms of this process are
analyzed in this study. Constitutive equation of superplastic state is
obtained, which relates the strain rate, its rotational modes, local
irreversible stresses, temperature, and density of heat and mass transfer.
Special cases and their derived relations are analyzed. It is shown that SP is
determined by plastic equilibrium concurrent with the composition and structure
fluctuations. An expression is obtained for the superplastic flow velocity,
containing three terms: velocity of wave plastic macroprocess, increased by
fluctuations, velocity prescribed by the gradient of external sources
(diffusion, etc.), and velocity of the delayed intragranular slip. It should be
noted that transformation is a characteristic and necessary feature of SP flow.
In the absence of transformations, deformation occurs via creep. Fragmentation
of the deforming region and grain-boundary sliding (GBS) are discussed and so
are their mechanisms and characteristic features. Formulas are derived for the
strain rate under conditions of GBS and the reasons for its non-monotonic
dependence on grain size, applied stresses and temperature are analyzed.

distinct signature of EBs has been found in the He I 10830 {\AA} line, and
conclusive observations of EBs in He I D 3 have never been reported. Aims. We
aim to study the signature of EBs in neutral helium triplet lines. Methods. The
observations consist of 10 consecutive SST/TRIPPEL raster scans close to the
limb, featuring the H$\beta$, He I D3 and He I 10830 {\AA} spectral regions. We
also obtained raster scans with IRIS and make use of the SDO/AIA 1700 {\AA}
channel. We use Hazel to invert the neutral helium triplet lines. Results.
Three EBs in our data show distinct emission signatures in neutral helium
triplet lines, most prominently visible in the He I D3 line. The helium lines
have two components: a broad and blue-shifted emission component associated
with the EB, and a narrower absorption component formed in the overlying
chromosphere. One of the EBs in our data shows evidence of strong velocity
gradients in its emission component. The emission component of the other two
EBs could be fitted using a constant slab. Our analysis hints towards thermal
Doppler motions having a large contribution to the broadening for helium and
IRIS lines. We conclude that the EBs must have high temperatures to exhibit
emission signals in neutral helium triplet lines. An order of magnitude
estimate places our observed EBs in the range of $T\sim 2\cdot 10^4-10^5$ K.

preconditioned Picard iteration. Using this approach, we can systematically
construct explicit, implicit and semi-implicit schemes with arbitrary order of
accuracy. We also show that the same schemes can be constructed by solving a
series of correction equations based on the DG weak formulation. The accuracy
of the schemes is proven to be $\min\{2p+1, K+1\}$ with $p$ the degree of the

to accelerate their convergence speed. The new multilevel scheme is intended to
provide a flexible framework for high order space-time discretizations and to
be coupled with space-time multigrid techniques for solving partial
differential equations (PDEs). We present numerical examples for ODEs and PDEs

agents is a subject of high practical importance (e.g. in evacuation dynamics),
but still limited mathematical basis. In particular the transition from
discrete optimal control to a continuum setting as the number of particles
tends to infinity is by far not fully understood. In this paper we contribute
to this issue by studying a canonical model of controlling an interacting
particle system into a certain spatial region by repulsive forces from few
external agents, which might be interpreted as shepherd dogs leading sheep to
their home.
  We discuss the appropriate modelling of such a problem and the associated
optimality systems, providing some connections between the Lagrange multipliers
in the discrete and continuum setting. As control strategies we investigate an
Instantaneous Control and a global Optimal Control approach.
  The solutions of a family of control problems for the particle system with
external agents are numerically compared to the mean-field controls as the
number of particles tends to infinity. In both cases, this leads to a high
dimensional phase space requiring tailored optimization strategies. All control
problems arising are solved using adjoint information to compute the descent
directions. The numerical results indicate the convergence of controls for both

unreliable, biased, and generally untrustworthy [1], [2], [3]. Yet, factuality
& objectivity detection is not a standard component of IR systems, even though
it has been possible in Natural Language Processing (NLP) in the last decade.
Motivated by this, we ask if and how factuality & objectivity detection may
benefit IR. We answer this in two parts. First, we use state-of-the-art NLP to
compute the probability of document factuality & objectivity in two TREC
collections, and analyse its relation to document relevance. We find that
factuality is strongly and positively correlated to document relevance, but
objectivity is not. Second, we study the impact of factuality & objectivity to
retrieval effectiveness by treating them as query independent features that we
combine with a competitive language modelling baseline. Experiments with 450
TREC queries show that factuality improves precision >10% over strong
baselines, especially for uncurated data used in web search; objectivity gives
mixed results. An overall clear trend is that document factuality & objectivity
is much more beneficial to IR when searching uncurated (e.g. web) documents vs.
curated (e.g. state documentation and newswire articles). To our knowledge,
this is the first study of factuality & objectivity for back-end IR,
contributing novel findings about the relation between relevance and
factuality/objectivity, and statistically significant gains to retrieval
effectiveness in the competitive web search task.

counting experiments with ca. 3 kBq 22Na and 60Co sources were conducted at
unit #1 (2.775 GW_th) of the Koeberg Nuclear Power Station in South Africa. The
setup consisted of one NaI crystal to measure de-excitation and annihilation
photons associated with beta decay. Its volume and well shape were chosen to
use coincidence summing in order to differentiate between electron capture and
beta+ emission in 22Na. The setup was shielded from the reactor core by 8 m of
uninterrupted concrete. Background radiation, responsible for ca. 1% of the
total countrate with either source, increased by merely 3% when the reactor
status changed from OFF to ON. Normalized countrates of three energy
regions-of-interest (TOT, MED, HI) were parameterized to jointly describe the
time dependence of two instrumental effects and a reactor-status step function
in a least-squares regression analysis. With the 22Na source, the fractional
countrate changes in the step from reactor OFF to ON were: (delA/A)_TOT =
[-3.02 +- 0.14(stat) +- 0.07(syst)] x 10^-4, (delA/A)_MED = [+1.44 +-

contain the possible influence from environmental factors and the finite
stability of the MCA clock-oscillator. No reactor-status dependence was
observed with the 60Co source. The corresponding cross sections are [1.55 +-

Here we review three of the most widely used correlated-noise estimators in the
exoplanet field, the time-averaging, residual-permutation, and
wavelet-likelihood methods. We argue that the residual-permutation method is
unsound in estimating the uncertainty of parameter estimates. We thus recommend
to refrain from this method altogether. We characterize the behavior of the
time averaging's rms-vs.-bin-size curves at bin sizes similar to the total
observation duration, which may lead to underestimated uncertainties. For the
wavelet-likelihood method, we note errors in the published equations and
provide a list of corrections. We further assess the performance of these
techniques by injecting and retrieving eclipse signals into synthetic and real
Spitzer light curves, analyzing the results in terms of the relative-accuracy
and coverage-fraction statistics. Both the time-averaging and
wavelet-likelihood methods significantly improve the estimate of the eclipse
depth over a white-noise analysis (a Markov-chain Monte Carlo exploration
assuming uncorrelated noise). However, the corrections are not perfect, when
retrieving the eclipse depth from Spitzer datasets, these methods covered the
true (injected) depth within the 68\% credible region in only $\sim$45--65\% of
the trials. Lastly, we present our open-source model-fitting tool, Multi-Core

correlations equilibrate after a quantum quench. Then we show that the
equilibrium state is locally equivalent to a thermal state, provided that the
free energy of the equilibrium state is sufficiently small and the thermal
state has exponentially decaying correlations. As an application, we look at a
related important question: When are thermal states stable against noise? In
other words, if we locally disturb a closed quantum system in a thermal state,
will it return to thermal equilibrium? We rigorously show that this occurs when
the correlations in the thermal state are exponentially decaying. All our
results come with finite-size bounds, which are crucial for the growing field
of quantum thermodynamics and other physical applications.

to the construction of both two- and three-dimensional fields, greatly

networks composed of identical nodes. The state corresponds to have all layers
synchronized, with nodes in each layer which do not necessarily evolve in
unison. So far, the study of such a solution has been restricted to the case in
which all layers had an identical connectivity structure. When layers are not
identical, the inter-layer synchronous state is no longer a stable solution of
the system. Nevertheless, when layers differ in just a few links, an
approximate treatment is still feasible, and allows one to gather information
on whether and how the system may wander around an inter-layer synchronous
configuration. We report the details of an approximate analytical treatment for
a two-layer multiplex, which results in the introduction of an extra inertial
term accounting for structural differences. Numerical validation of the
predictions highlights the usefulness of our approach, especially for small or
moderate topological differences in the intra-layer coupling. Moreover, we
identify a non-trivial relationship between the betweenness centrality of the
missing links and the intra-layer coupling strength. Finally, by the use of two
multiplexed identical layers of electronic circuits in a chaotic regime, we
study the loss of inter-layer synchronization as a function of the betweenness
centrality of the removed links.

groupoid, we introduce a singular integral operator which is the formal
analogue of the logarithm of the Laplacian on a Riemannian manifold. Assembling
this operator with the infinitesimal generator of the gauge action on $O_{N}$
yields a $\theta$-summable spectral triple whose phase is finitely summable.
The relation to previous constructions of Fredholm modules and spectral triples
on $O_{N}$ is discussed.

10^6\,M_\odot$) giant molecular clouds (GMCs): one gravitationally bound
collapsing cloud and one unbound cloud undergoing disruption by galactic shear.
These two clouds have been extracted from a large scale galaxy model and are
re-simulated at a spatial resolution of $\sim 0.01$ pc, including feedback from
winds, SNe, and the combined effect of both. We find that stellar winds stop
accretion of gas onto sink particles, and can also trigger star formation in
the shells formed by the winds, although the overall effect is to reduce the
global star formation rate of both clouds. Furthermore, we observe that winds
tend to escape through the corridors of diffuse gas. The effect of SNe is not
so prominent and the star formation rate is similar to models neglecting
stellar feedback. We find that most of the energy injected by the SNe is
radiated away, but overdense areas are created by multiple and concurrent SN
events especially in the most virialised cloud. Our results suggest that the
impact of stellar feedback is sensitive to the morphology of star forming
clouds, which is set by large scale galactic flows, being of greater importance
in clouds undergoing gravitational collapse.

variability. Despite numerous studies, the intrinsic properties underlying its
anomalous behaviour remain poorly understood. Since 2014 September we are
conducting the first quasi-simultaneous optical and near-infrared photometric
monitoring of A0538-66 in seven filters with the Rapid Eye Mount (REM)
telescope, aiming to understand the properties of this binary system. We found
that the REM lightcurves show fast flares lasting one or two days that repeat
almost regularly every ~16.6 days, the orbital period of the neutron star. If
the optical flares are powered by X-ray outbursts through photon reprocessing,
the REM lightcurves indicate that A0538-66 is still active in X-rays: bright
X-ray flares (L_x > 1E37 erg/s) could be observable during the periastron
passages. The REM lightcurves show a long-term variability that is especially
pronounced in the g band and decreases with increasing wavelength, until it no
longer appears in the near-infrared lightcurves. In addition, A0538-66 is
fainter with respect to previous optical observations most likely due to the
higher absorption of the stellar radiation of a denser circumstellar disc. On
the basis of the current models, we interpret these observational results with
a circumstellar disc around the Be star observed nearly edge-on during a
partial depletion phase. The REM lightcurves also show short-term variability
on timescales of ~1 day possibly indicative of perturbations in the density
distribution of the circumstellar disc caused by the tidal interaction with the
neutron star.

formation, prior to migration, and the metallicity of the host star, based on
the core accretion model and radial profiles of dust surface density and gas
temperature. At that time, less than two hundred extrasolar planets were known,
limiting the scope of our analysis. Here we take into account the expanded
statistics allowed by new discoveries, in order to check the validity of some
premises. We compare predictions with the present available data and results
for different stellar mass ranges. We find that the Zero Age Planetary Orbit
(ZAPO) hypothesis continues to hold after a one order of magnitude increase in
discovered planets. In particular, the prediction that metal poor stars harbor
planets with an average radius distinctively lower than metal rich ones is
still evident in the statistics, and cannot be explained away by chaotic
planetary formation mechanisms involving migration and gravitational
interaction between planets. The ZAPO hypothesis predicts that in metal poor
stars the planets are formed nearer their host stars; as a consequence, they
are more frequently engulfed by the stars during the migration process or
stripped of their gaseous envelops. The depleted number of gas giant planets
around metal poor stars would then be the result of the synergy between low
formation probability, as predicted by the core accretion model, and high
destruction probability, for the ones that are formed.

work, we use the disorder generated by Cr substitution of Al atoms in LaAlO3 as
a tool to explore the nature of superconductivity and spin-orbit coupling in
these interfaces. A reduction of the superconducting Tc is observed with Cr
doping consistent with an increase of electron-electron interaction in presence
of disorder. In addition, the evolution of spin-orbit coupling with gate
voltage and Cr doping suggests a D'Yakonov-Perel mechanism of spin relaxation
in the presence of a Rashba-type spin-orbit interaction.

have an unprecedented platform from which to understand individuals and predict
their future actions. This work builds upon the Context Tree data structure
that summarises the historical contexts of individuals from augmented
geospatial trajectories, and constructs a predictive model for their likely
future contexts. The Predictive Context Tree (PCT) is constructed as a
hierarchical classifier, capable of predicting both the future locations that a
user will visit and the contexts that a user will be immersed within. The PCT
is evaluated over real-world geospatial trajectories, and compared against
existing location extraction and prediction techniques, as well as a proposed
hybrid approach that uses identified land usage elements in combination with
machine learning to predict future interactions. Our results demonstrate that
higher predictive accuracies can be achieved using this hybrid approach over
traditional extracted location datasets, and the PCT itself matches the
performance of the hybrid approach at predicting future interactions, while
adding utility in the form of context predictions. Such a prediction system is
capable of understanding not only where a user will visit, but also their
context, in terms of what they are likely to be doing.

gender, age, and emotional state which can be used in a variety of speech
analysis applications. In this paper, a divide and conquer strategy for
ensemble classification has been proposed to recognize emotions in speech.
Intrinsic hierarchy in emotions has been utilized to construct an emotions
tree, which assisted in breaking down the emotion recognition task into smaller
sub tasks. The proposed framework generates predictions in three phases.
Firstly, emotions are detected in the input speech signal by classifying it as
neutral or emotional. If the speech is classified as emotional, then in the
second phase, it is further classified into positive and negative classes.
Finally, individual positive or negative emotions are identified based on the
outcomes of the previous stages. Several experiments have been performed on a
widely used benchmark dataset. The proposed method was able to achieve improved
recognition rates as compared to several other approaches.

density perturbation (IDP) into a number of ion-acoustic solitary waves (IASWs)
in the presence of the trapping effect of electrons. The non-linear fluid
theory developed by Schamel has identified three separate regimes of
ion-acoustic solitary waves based on the trapping parameter. Here, the
disintegration process and the resulting self-consistent IASWs are studied in a
wide range of trapping parameters covering all the three regimes continuously.
The dependency of features such as the time of disintegration, the number,
speed and size of IASWs on the trapping parameter are focused upon. It is shown
that an increase in this parameter slows down the propagation of IASWs while
decreases their sizes in the phase space. These features of IASWs tend to
saturate for large value of trapping parameters. The disintegration time shows
a more complicated behavior than what was predicted by the theoretical
approach. Also for the case of trapping parameters bigger than one, propagation
of IASWs is observed in contrast with the theoretical predictions. The kinetic
simulation results unveil a smooth and well-defined dependency of solitary
waves' features on the trapping parameter, showing the possibility of bridging
all the three regimes. Finally, it is shown that for beta around zero, the
electron phase space structure of the accompanying vortex stays symmetric. The
effect of the electron-to-ion temperature ratio on the disintegration and the
propagation of IASWs are considered as a benchmarking test of the simulation
code (in the nonlinear regime).

systematic variation of the resonant frequency; these frequency changes result
from thermal stresses that depend on temperature dependent thermal conductivity

coefficient of InAs is reflected in the resonant response of the system near a
bath temperature of 20 K. Using finite element simulations to model the
experimentally observed frequency shifts, we show that the thermal conductivity
of a nanowire can be approximated in the 10-60 K temperature range by the
empirical form $\kappa=b$T W/mK, where the value of $b$ for a nanowire was
found to be $b=0.035$ W/mK$^2$, significantly lower than bulk values. Also,
local heating allows us to independently vary the temperature of the nanowire
relative to the clamping points pinned to the bath temperature. We suggest a
loss mechanism (dissipation $\sim10^{-4}-10^{-5}$) originating from the
interfacial clamping losses between the metal and the semiconductor
nanostructure.

for yield-stress (i.e. viscoplastic) fluids has been investigated. The first
approach is based on the popular Papanastasiou regularisation of the fluid
rheology in conjunction with explicit modification of the lattice Boltzmann
relaxation rate. The second approach uses a locally-implicit formulation to
simultaneously solve for the fluid stress and the underlying particle
distribution functions. After investigating issues related to the lattice
symmetry and non-hydrodynamic Burnett stresses, the two models were compared in
terms of spatial convergence and their behaviour in transient and inertial
flows. The choice of lattice and the presence of Burnett stresses was found to
influence the results of both models, however the latter did not significantly
degrade the velocity field. Using Bingham flows in ducts and synthetic porous
media, it was found that the implicitly-regularised model was superior in
capturing transient and inertial fluid behaviour. This result presents
potential implications for the application of the Papanastasiou-regularised
model in such scenarios. In creeping flows the performance of both models was
found to be both similar and satisfactory.

in both one-dimensional and three-dimensional atmosphere models. An inherent
difficulty with this method is how to treat overlapping absorption, i.e.
absorption by more than one gas in a given spectral region. We have evaluated
the applicability of three different methods in hot Jupiter and brown dwarf
atmosphere models, all of which have been previously applied within models in
the literature: (i) Random overlap, both with and without resorting and
rebinning, (ii) equivalent extinction and (iii) pre-mixing of opacities, where
(i) and (ii) combine k-coefficients for different gases to obtain
k-coefficients for a mixture of gases, while (iii) calculates k-coefficients
for a given mixture from the corresponding mixed line-by-line opacities. We
find that the random overlap method is the most accurate and flexible of these
treatments, and is fast enough to be used in one-dimensional models with
resorting and rebinning. In three-dimensional models such as GCMs it is too
slow, however, and equivalent extinction can provide a speed-up of at least a
factor of three with only a minor loss of accuracy while at the same time
retaining the flexibility gained by combining k-coefficients computed for each
gas individually. Pre-mixed opacities are significantly less flexible, and we
also find that particular care must be taken when using this method in order to
to adequately resolve steep variations in composition at important chemical
equilibrium boundaries. We use the random overlap method with resorting and
rebinning in our one-dimensional atmosphere model and equivalent extinction in
our GCM, which allows us to e.g. consistently treat the feedback of
non-equilibrium chemistry on the total opacity and therefore the calculated P-T
profiles in our models.

was to investigate the impact of image quantization.Material and methods: A
Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act -compliant secondary
analysis of deidentified prospectively acquired PET/CT test-retest datasets of
74 patients from multi-center Merck and ACRIN trials was performed.
Metabolically active volumes were automatically delineated on PET with Fuzzy
Locally Adaptive Bayesian algorithm. 3DSlicerTM was used to semi-automatically
delineate the anatomical volumes on low-dose CT components. Two quantization
methods were considered: a quantization into a set number of bins
(quantizationB) and an alternative quantization with bins of fixed width
(quantizationW). Four shape descriptors, ten first-order metrics and 26
textural features were computed. Bland-Altman analysis was used to quantify
repeatability. Features were subsequently categorized as very reliable,
reliable, moderately reliable and poorly reliable with respect to the
corresponding volume variability. Results: Repeatability was highly variable
amongst features. Numerous metrics were identified as poorly or moderately
reliable. Others were (very) reliable in both modalities, and in all categories
(shape, 1st-, 2nd- and 3rd-order metrics). Image quantization played a major
role in the features repeatability. Features were more reliable in PET with
quantizationB, whereas quantizationW showed better results in CT.Conclusion:
The test-retest repeatability of shape and heterogeneity features in PET and
low-dose CT varied greatly amongst metrics. The level of repeatability also
depended strongly on the quantization step, with different optimal choices for
each modality. The repeatability of PET and low-dose CT features should be
carefully taken into account when selecting metrics to build multiparametric
models.

M(t)$. The observed $\dot M(t)$ is obtained from spectral modelling of the
archival RXTE/PCA data. Different scenarios of disk decay evolution are
possible depending on a degree of self-irradiation of the disk by the emission
from its centre. If the self-irradiation, which is parametrized by factor
$C_\mathrm{irr}$, had been as high as $\sim 5\times10^{-3}$, then the disk
would have been completely ionized up to the tidal radius and the short time of
the decay would have required the turbulent parameter $\alpha\sim 3$. We find
that the shape of the $\dot M(t)$ curve is much better explained in a model
with a shrinking high-viscosity zone. If $C_\mathrm{irr}\approx(2-3)\times
10^{-4}$, the resulting $\alpha$ lie in the interval $0.5-1.5$ for the black
hole masses in the range $6-10~\mathrm{M}_\odot$, while the radius of the
ionized disk is variable and controlled by irradiation. For very weak
irradiation, $C_\mathrm{irr} < 1.5 \times10^{-4}$, the burst decline develops
as in normal outbursts of dwarf novae with $\alpha \sim 0.08-0.32$. The optical
data indicate that $C_\mathrm{irr}$ in 4U 1543-47 (2002) was not greater than
approximately $(3-6)\times10^{-4}$. Generally, modelling of an X-ray nova burst
allows one to estimate $\alpha$ that depends on the black hole parameters. We
present the public 1-D code Freddi to model the viscous evolution of an
accretion disk. Analytic approximations are derived to estimate $\alpha$ in
X-ray novae using $\dot M(t)$.

representation, the growth equation, we study the growth and division
mechanisms of amoeba and fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe. We show how
this mechanism, together with biomolecular machinery, governs growth and
reproduction of cells, and these organisms in particular. This mechanism
provides revealing answers to fundamental questions of biology, like why cells
grow and divide, why and when cells' growth stops. It also sheds light on
questions like why and how life originated and developed. Solving the growth
equation, we obtain analytical expression for the growth curve of fission yeast
as a function of geometrical characteristics and nutrient influxes for RNA and
protein synthesis, and compare the computed growth curves with 85 experiments.
Statistical evaluation shows that these growth curves correspond to
experimental data significantly better than all previous approximations. Also,
using the general growth mechanism, we show how metabolic characteristics of
cells, their size and evolutionary traits relate, considering fission yeast. In
particular, we found that fission yeast S. pombe consumes about 16-18 times
more nutrients for maintenance needs than for biomass synthesis.

goal is to minimize the time average of a cost function subject to a set of
constraints on the time averages of a related stochastic processes called
penalties. We assume that a delayed information about an event in the system is
available as a common information at every user, and the state of the system is
evolving in an independent and non-stationary fashion. We show that an
approximate Drift-plus-penalty (DPP) algorithm that we propose achieves a time
average cost that is within some positive constant epsilon of the optimal cost
with high probability. Further, we provide a condition on the waiting time for
this result to hold. The condition is shown to be a function of the mixing
coefficient, the number of samples (w) used to compute an estimate of the
distribution of the state, and the delay. Unlike the existing work, the method
used in the paper can be adapted to prove high probability results when the
state is evolving in a non-i.i.d and non-stationary fashion. Under mild
conditions, we show that the dependency of the error bound on w is exponential,
which is a significant improvement compared to the exiting work.

the tragedy of the common state. This unfortunate scenario can be avoided if
participation is not obligatory but only happens with a given probability. But
what if we also consider a player's individual wealth when to decide about
participation? To address this issue we propose a model in which the
probabilistic participation in the public goods game is combined with a
conditional investment mode that is based on individual wealth: if a player's
wealth exceeds a threshold value then it is qualified and can participate in
the joint venture. Otherwise, the participation is forbidden in the investment
interactions. We show that if only probabilistic participation is considered,
spatially structured populations cannot support cooperation better than
well-mixed populations where full defection state can also be avoided for small
participation probabilities. By adding the wealth-based criterion of
participation, however, structured populations are capable to augment network
reciprocity relevantly and allow cooperator strategy to dominate in a broader

$N(p)\pi(-p)$ with $p\simeq 2\pi/L$, where momenta are given in parentheses.
This is the first simulation where the expected multi-hadron states are found

approximation of purely elastic $N\pi$ scattering -- imply an additional
eigenstate near the Roper mass $m_R\simeq 1.43~$GeV for our lattice size. We do
not observe any such additional eigenstate, which indicates that $N\pi$ elastic
scattering alone does not render a low-lying Roper. Coupling with other
channels, most notably with $N\pi\pi$, seems to be important for generating the
Roper resonance, reinforcing the notion that this state could be a dynamically
generated resonance. Our results are in line with most of previous lattice

that are approximately efficient. For deterministic mechanisms, we show that a
strategyproof and budget-balanced mechanism must have a sink agent whose
valuation function is ignored in selecting an alternative, and she is
compensated with the payments made by the other agents. We assume the
valuations of the agents come from a bounded open interval. Using this result,
we find a tight lower bound on the inefficiencies of strategyproof,
budget-balanced mechanisms in this domain. The bound shows that the
inefficiency asymptotically disappears when the number of agents is large---a
result close in spirit to Green and Laffont (1979, Theorem 9.4). However, our
results provide worst-case bounds and the best possible rate of convergence.
  Next, we consider minimizing any convex combination of inefficiency and
budget imbalance. We show that if the valuations are unrestricted, no
deterministic mechanism can do asymptotically better than minimizing
inefficiency alone.
  Finally, we investigate randomized mechanisms and provide improved lower
bounds on expected inefficiency. We give a tight lower bound for an interesting
class of strategyproof, budget-balanced, randomized mechanisms. We also use an
optimization-based approach---in the spirit of automated mechanism design---to
provide a lower bound on the minimum achievable inefficiency of any randomized
mechanism.
  Experiments with real data from two applications show that the inefficiency
for a simple randomized mechanism is 5--100 times smaller than the worst case.
This relative difference increases with the number of agents.

archetypal cooperative/coherent normal-mode distortions such as those in

map the strong-coupling problem to a weak-coupling one, we obtain an effective
Hamiltonian involving nearest-neighbor, next-nearest-neighbor, and
next-to-next-nearest-neighbor hoppings and repulsions. Using stochastic series
expansion quantum Monte Carlo, we construct the phase diagram of the system. As
coupling strength is increased, we find that the system undergoes a first-order

Telescopes (SSTs) of the Cherenkov Telescope Array (CTA). Its purpose is to
extend the sensitivity of CTA to gamma-ray energies reaching 300 TeV. Its
dual-mirror optical design and curved focal plane enables the use of a compact
camera of 0.4 m diameter, while achieving a field of view of above 8 degrees.
Through the use of the digitising TARGET ASICs, the Cherenkov flash is sampled
once per nanosecond continuously and then digitised when triggering conditions
are met within the analogue outputs of the photosensors. Entire waveforms
(typically covering 96 ns) for all 2048 pixels are then stored for analysis,
allowing for a broad spectrum of investigations to be performed on the data.
Two prototypes of the GCT camera are under development, with differing
photosensors: Multi-Anode Photomultipliers (MAPMs) and Silicon Photomultipliers
(SiPMs). During November 2015, the GCT MAPM (GCT-M) prototype camera was
integrated onto the GCT structure at the Observatoire de Paris-Meudon, where it
observed the first Cherenkov light detected by a prototype instrument for CTA.

linear assumption. In this study, we analyse its limitations with respect to
changes of structural variables.We wish to provide a more extended theoretical
background to structural linear inversions by doing a study of the validity of
the linear assumption for various structural variables. First, we recall the
origins of the linear assumption for structural stellar inversions and explain
its importance for asteroseismic studies. We recall the impact of unknown
structural quantities such as the mass and the radius of the star on structural
inversion results. We explain how kernels for new structural variables can be
derived using two methods, one suited to asteroseismic targets, the other to
helioseismic targets. For this second method, we present a new structural pair,
namely the (A, Y) structural kernels. The kernels are tested in various
numerical experiments that enable us to evaluate the weaknesses of different
pairs and the domains of validity of their respective linear regime. The
numerical tests we carry out allow us to disentangle the impact of various
uncertainties in stellar models on the verification of the linear integral
relations. We show the importance of metallicity, the equation of state,
extra-mixing, and inaccuracies in the microphysics. We discuss the limitations

addressing fundamental questions such as the leptonic CP violation and the
neutrino mass hierarchy through analyzing data from next-generation neutrino

reactions spans a broad range and, accordingly, the dominant reaction mechanism
varies across the energy region from quasi-elastic scattering through nucleon
resonance excitations to deep inelastic scattering. This corresponds to
transitions of the effective degree of freedom for theoretical description from
nucleons through meson-baryon to quarks. The main purpose of this review is to
report our recent efforts towards a unified description of the neutrino-nucleus
reactions over the wide energy range; recent overall progress in the field is
also sketched. Starting with an overview of the current status of
neutrino-nucleus scattering experiments, we formulate the cross section to be

the neutrino-nucleon reactions follows and, in particular, a dynamical
coupled-channels model for meson productions in and beyond the $\Delta$(1232)

putting emphasis on our theoretical approaches. We start the discussion with
electroweak processes in few-nucleon systems studied with the correlated
Gaussian method. Then we describe quasi-elastic scattering with nuclear
spectral functions, and meson productions with a $\Delta$-hole model. Nuclear
modifications of the parton distribution functions determined through a global

field can excite a nonparaxial field inside an epsilon-near-zero slab since it
hosts slowly varying fields over physically large portion of the bulk. Our

researchers: How can stable low-D materials exist? What kind of low-D materials
are stable? Here, we establish an energy stability criterion for low-D

certain kind of element, the stability of its specific low-D structure is
determined by several derivatives of its interatomic potential. This

functions into a commutative monoid. We study the question if a given data
vector can be expressed as a finite sum of others, only assuming that 1) the
domain is countable and 2) the given set of base vectors is finite up to
permutations of the domain.
  Based on a succinct representation of the involved permutations as integer
linear constraints, we derive that positive instances can be witnessed in a
bounded subset of the domain.
  For data vectors over a group we moreover study when a data vector is
reversible, that is, if its inverse is expressible using only nonnegative
coefficients. We show that if all base vectors are reversible then the
expressibility problem reduces to checking membership in finitely generated
subgroups. Moreover, checking reversibility also reduces to such membership
tests.
  These questions naturally appear in the analysis of counter machines extended
with unordered data: namely, for data vectors over $(\mathbb{Z}^d,+)$
expressibility directly corresponds to checking state equations for Coloured
Petri nets where tokens can only be tested for equality. We derive that in this
case, expressibility is in NP, and in P for reversible instances. These upper
bounds are tight: they match the lower bounds for standard integer vectors

known to hold. We prove a bound of the form $n=\mathcal{O}(kd^2)$ for trees and

development of Gradient TD (GTD) algorithms has addressed this problem
successfully. However, the success of GTD algorithms requires a set of well

GTD algorithms with $\ell_1$ regularization. We propose a family of $\ell_1$

relying on a balance of dispersion and nonlinearity. Soliton-based data
transmission schemes were investigated in the 1980s, promising to overcome the
limitations imposed by dispersion of optical fibers. These approaches, however,
were eventually abandoned in favor of wavelength-division multiplexing (WDM)
schemes that are easier to implement and offer improved scalability to higher
data rates. Here, we show that solitons may experience a comeback in optical
communications, this time not as a competitor, but as a key element of
massively parallel WDM. Instead of encoding data on the soliton itself, we
exploit continuously circulating dissipative Kerr solitons (DKS) in a
microresonator. DKS are generated in an integrated silicon nitride
microresonator by four-photon interactions mediated by Kerr nonlinearity,
leading to low-noise, spectrally smooth and broadband optical frequency combs.
In our experiments, we use two interleaved soliton Kerr combs to transmit a
data stream of more than 50Tbit/s on a total of 179 individual optical carriers
that span the entire telecommunication C and L bands. Equally important, we
demonstrate coherent detection of a WDM data stream by using a pair of
microresonator Kerr soliton combs - one as a multi-wavelength light source at
the transmitter, and another one as a corresponding local oscillator (LO) at
the receiver. This approach exploits the scalability advantages of
microresonator soliton comb sources for massively parallel optical
communications both at the transmitter and receiver side. Taken together, the
results prove the significant potential of these sources to replace arrays of
continuous-wave lasers in high-speed communications.

electric field, we present a feedback-based particle guiding method, quite
analogous to the ""run-and-tumbling"" behavior of Escherichia coli but with a
deterministic steering in the tumbling phase: the particle is set to the ""run""
state when its orientation vector aligns with the target, while the transition
to the ""steering"" state is triggered when it exceeds a tolerance angle
{\alpha}. The active and deterministic reorientation of the particle is
achieved by a characteristic rotational motion that can be switched on and off
by modulating the AC frequency of the electric field, first reported in this
work. Relying on numerical simulations and analytical results, we show that
this feedback algorithm can be optimized by tuning the tolerance angle
{\alpha}. The optimal resetting angle depends on signal to noise ratio in the
steering state, and it is demonstrated in the experiment. Proposed method is
simple and robust for targeting, despite variability in self-propelling speeds
and angular velocities of individual particles.

\times \mathbf{B}$ experienced by a particle with charge $q$ moving in a
magnetic field $\mathbf{B}$. We call this new force gravitomagnetic dynamical
friction and calculate its magnitude for a spinning black hole moving through a
field of stars with Maxwellian velocity dispersion $\sigma$, assuming that both
$v$ and $\sigma$ are much less than the speed of light $c$. We use
post-Newtonian equations of motion accurate to $\mathcal{O}(v^3/c^3)$ needed to
capture the effect of spin-orbit coupling and also include direct stellar
capture by the black hole's event horizon. Gravitomagnetic dynamical friction
will cause a black hole with uniform speed to spiral about the direction of its
spin, similar to a charged particle spiraling about a magnetic field line, and
will exert a torque on a supermassive black hole orbiting a galactic center,
causing the angular momentum of this orbit to slowly precess about the
black-hole spin. As this effect is suppressed by a factor $(\sigma/c)^2$ in
nonrelativistic systems, we expect it to be negligible in most astrophysical
contexts but provide this calculation for its theoretical interest and
potential application to relativistic systems.

account gravitationally induced particle production in the very early Universe.
In our scenario, the baryon asymmetry is generated dynamically during an
inflationary epoch powered by ultra-relativistic particles. The adiabatic
particle production rate provides both the needed negative pressure to
accelerate the radiation dominated Universe and a non-zero chemical potential
which distinguishes baryons and anti-baryons thereby producing a baryon
asymmetry in agreement with the observed value. Reciprocally, the present day
asymmetry may be used to determine the inflationary scale at early times.
Successful gravitational baryogenesis is dynamically generated for many
different choices of the relevant model parameters.
