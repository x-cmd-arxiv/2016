  weak intensity","93 pages, 1 figure, Comments are welcome. arXiv admin note:
  substantial text overlap with arXiv:1412.3058",,,,"math.AP math-ph math.MP","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In this paper we continue to study the shock formation for the
$3$-dimensional quasilinear wave equation \begin{align}\label{main eq}
-(1+3G""(0)(\partial_{t}\phi)^{2})\partial^{2}_{t}\phi+\Delta\phi=0,\tag{\textbf{$\star$}}
\end{align} with $G""(0)$ being a non-zero constant. Since \eqref{main eq}
admits global-in-time solution with small initial data, to present shock
formation, we consider a class of large data. Moreover, no symmetric assumption
is imposed on the data. Compared to our previous work [18], here we pose data
on the hypersurface $\{(t,x)|t=-r_{0}\}$ instead of $\{(t,x)|t=-2\}$, with
$r_{0}$ being arbitrarily large. We prove an a priori energy estimate
independent of $r_{0}$. Therefore a complete description of the solution
behavior as $r_{0}\rightarrow\infty$ is obtained. This allows us to relax the
restriction on the profile of initial data which still guarantees shock
formation. Since \eqref{main eq} can be viewed as a model equation for
describing the propagation of electromagnetic waves in nonlinear dielectric,
the result in this paper reveals the possibility to use wave pulse with weak
intensity to form electromagnetic shocks in laboratory. A main new feature in
the proof is that all estimates in the present paper do \emph{not} depend on
the parameter $r_{0}$, which requires different methods to obtain energy
estimates. As a byproduct, we prove the existence of semi-global-in-time
solutions which lead to shock formation by showing that the limits of the
initial energies exist as $r_{0}\rightarrow\infty$. The proof combines the
ideas in [5] where the the formation of shocks for 3-dimensional relativistic
compressible Euler equations with small initial data is established, and the
short pulse method introduced in [6] and generalized in [15], where the
formation of black holes in general relativity is proved.

  Region for Conductive Heat Transport","Draft",,"10.1088/1361-6587/ab240f",,"physics.plasm-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Topic is the divertor broadening $S$, being a result of perpendicular
transport in the scrape-off layer and resulting in a better distribution of the
power load onto the divertor target. Recent studies show a scaling of the
divertor broadening with an inverse power law to the target temperature $T_t$,
promising its reduction to be a way of distributing the power entering the
divertor volume onto a large surface area.
  It is shown that for pure conductive transport in the divertor region the
suggested inverse power law scaling to $T_t$ is only valid for high target
electron temperatures. For decreasing target temperatures ($T_t < 20\,$eV) the
increase of $S$ stagnates and the conductive model results in a finite value of
$S$ even for zero target temperature. It is concluded that the target
temperature is no valid parameter for a power law scaling, as it is not
representative for the entire divertor volume. This is shown in simulations
solving the 2D heat diffusion equation, which is used as reference for an
analytic 1D model describing the divertor broadening along a field line solely
by the ratio of the perpendicular to the parallel diffusivity.
  By assuming the temperature dependence of these two quantities an integral
form of $S$ is derived, relying only on the temperature distribution along the
separatrix between X-point and target. Integration along the separatrix results
in an approximation for $S$, being in agreement with the 2D simulations. This
model is also applicable to scenarios including heat losses, e.g. due to
radiation.
  Convective transport can not be neglected for high recycling conditions,
hence the derived expression for $S$ is not expected to hold. However, based on
the non-vanishing parallel transport, respective the finite parallel transport
time, the divertor broadening is expected to reach a finite value.

can drive an instability known as sedimentary fingering convection. This
phenomenon is thought to occur beneath sediment-rich river plumes in lakes and
oceans, in the context of marine snow where decaying organic materials serve as
the suspended particles, or in the atmosphere in the presence of aerosols or
volcanic ash. Laboratory experiments of Houk and Green (1973) and Green (1987)
have shown sedimentary fingering convection to be similar to the more commonly
known thermohaline fingering convection in many ways. Here, we study the
phenomenon using 3D direct numerical simulations. We find evidence for layer
formation in sedimentary fingering convection in regions of parameter space
where it does not occur for non-sedimentary systems. This is due to two
complementary effects. Sedimentation affects the turbulent fluxes and broadens
the region of parameter space unstable to the $\gamma$-instability (Radko 2003)
to include systems at larger density ratios. It also gives rise to a new
layering instability that exists in $\gamma-$stable regimes. The former is
likely quite ubiquitous in geophysical systems for sufficiently large settling
velocities, while the latter probably grows too slowly to be relevant, at least
in the context of sediments in water.

  MIMO Systems","submitted to IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications",,,,"cs.IT math.IT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems achieve high sum
spectral efficiency by offering an order of magnitude increase in multiplexing
gains. In time division duplexing systems, however, the reuse of uplink
training pilots among cells results in additional channel estimation error,
which causes downlink inter-cell interference, even when large numbers of
antennas are employed. Handling this interference with conventional network
MIMO techniques is challenging due to the large channel dimensionality.
Further, the implementation of large antenna precoding/combining matrices is
associated with high hardware complexity and power consumption. In this paper,
we propose multi-layer precoding to enable efficient and low complexity
operation in full-dimensional massive MIMO, where a large number of antennas is
used in two dimensions. In multi-layer precoding, the precoding matrix of each
base station is written as a product of a number of precoding matrices, each
one called a layer. Multi-layer precoding (i) leverages the directional
characteristics of large-scale MIMO channels to manage inter-cell interference
with low channel knowledge requirements, and (ii) allows for an efficient
implementation using low-complexity hybrid analog/digital architectures. We
present a specific multi-layer precoding design for full-dimensional massive
MIMO systems. The performance of this precoding design is analyzed and the
per-user achievable rate is characterized for general channel models. The
asymptotic optimality of the proposed multi-layer precoding design is then
proved for some special yet important channels. Numerical simulations verify
the analytical results and illustrate the potential gains of multi-layer
precoding compared to traditional pilot-contaminated massive MIMO solutions.

by adding a component of customer heterogeneity induced by the location of
customers in relation to the server. Accordingly, customers incur a travel cost
which depends linearly on the distance of the customer from the server. The
arrival of customers with distances less than x is assumed to be a Poisson
process with rate lambda(x)=int_0^x h(y)dy<\infty, where h(y) is a nonnegative
intensity function of the distance y. In a loss system M/G/1/1 we define the
threshold Nash equilibrium strategy x_e and the optimal social threshold
strategy x^*. We show that if the rate of arriving customers is bounded then
PoA converges to 1 when x_e \to\infty, i.e., in the limit there is no
difference between the social and equilibrium optimal benefits. The rest of the
paper is dedicated for the case in which the rate of arriving customers is
unbounded. We develop an explicit formula to calculate lim_{x_e\to \infty}PoA
when it exists. We present sufficient conditions for the limit to exist and for
the existence of a simple formula for calculating it. We prove that if the
relation between two intensity functions converges to a positive constant, then
the corresponding limits of PoA coincide. If, on the other hand, one intensity
function is larger than the other from some point on, then under certain
conditions the limit of PoA (if exists) will be larger for the larger intensity
function. For all intensity functions h, we prove that if h converges to a
constant then PoA converges to 2, and that if from some point on h decreases
(increases) monotonically then the limit of PoA, if exists, is smaller (larger)
than 2. In a system with a queue we prove that the price of anarchy may be

respectively. However, very little is known about how inter-patient variability
in language task activation relates to variability in the structures affected
by stroke. Here, we used parallel independent component analysis (pICA) to
characterize links between patterns of structural damage and patterns of
functional MRI activation during semantic decisions. The pICA analysis revealed
a significant association between a lesion component featuring damage to left
posterior temporo-parietal cortex and the underlying deep white matter and an
fMRI component featuring (1) heightened activation in a primarily right
hemispheric network of frontal, temporal, and parietal regions, and (2) reduced
activation in areas associated with the semantic network activated by healthy
controls. Stronger loading parameters on both the lesion and fMRI activation
components were associated with poorer language test performance. Fiber
tracking suggests that lesions affecting the left posterior temporo-parietal
cortex and deep white matter may lead to the simultaneous disruption of
multiple long-range structural pathways connecting distal language areas.
Damage to the left posterior temporo-parietal cortex and underlying white
matter may (1) impede the language task-driven recruitment of canonical left
hemispheric language and other areas (e.g. the right anterior temporal lobe and
default mode regions) that likely support residual language function after
stroke, and (2) lead to the compensatory recruitment of right hemispheric
fronto-temporo-parietal networks for tasks requiring semantic processing.

severe energy constraints require much more careful accounting of energy usage
than what prior art provides. In particular, the available energy, the
differing power consumption levels for listening, receiving, and transmitting,
as well as the limited control bandwidth must all be considered. Therefore, we
formulate the problem of maximizing the throughput among a set of heterogeneous
broadcasting nodes with differing power consumption levels, each subject to a
strict ultra-low-power budget. We obtain the oracle throughput (i.e., maximum
throughput achieved by an oracle) and use Lagrangian methods to design EconCast
- a simple asynchronous distributed protocol in which nodes transition between
sleep, listen, and transmit states, and dynamically change the transition
rates. EconCast can operate in groupput or anyput modes to respectively
maximize two alternative throughput measures. We show that EconCast approaches
the oracle throughput. The performance is also evaluated numerically and via
extensive simulations and it is shown that EconCast outperforms prior art by 6x
- 17x under realistic assumptions. Moreover, we evaluate EconCast's latency
performance and consider design tradeoffs when operating in groupput and anyput

the oblate shape, considering only the oblate correction factor. For certain
values of the line force parameters (according to previous works), we obtain in
both scenarios a density contrast $\gtrsim10^{2}$ between equatorial and polar
densities, characterized for a fast polar wind and a slow and denser wind when
the $\Omega$-slow wind solution is obtained. All this properties are enhanced
when the oblate correction factor is included in our calculations.

robot and the environment to be reset to an initial state after each episode,

To study such networks, numerous random graph models have been proposed.
However, real-world networks are not drawn at random. Therefore, Brach, Cygan,
{\L}acki, and Sankowski [SODA 2016] introduced two natural deterministic
conditions: (1) a power-law upper bound on the degree distribution (PLB-U) and
(2) power-law neighborhoods, that is, the degree distribution of neighbors of
each vertex is also upper bounded by a power law (PLB-N). They showed that many
real-world networks satisfy both deterministic properties and exploit them to
design faster algorithms for a number of classical graph problems.
  We complement the work of Brach et al. by showing that some well-studied
random graph models exhibit both the mentioned PLB properties and additionally
also a power-law lower bound on the degree distribution (PLB-L). All three
properties hold with high probability for Chung-Lu Random Graphs and Geometric
Inhomogeneous Random Graphs and almost surely for Hyperbolic Random Graphs. As
a consequence, all results of Brach et al. also hold with high probability or
almost surely for those random graph classes.
  In the second part of this work we study three classical NP-hard
combinatorial optimization problems on PLB networks. It is known that on
general graphs with maximum degree {\Delta}, a greedy algorithm, which chooses
nodes in the order of their degree, only achieves an {\Omega}(ln
{\Delta})-approximation for Minimum Vertex Cover and Minimum Dominating Set,
and an {\Omega}({\Delta})-approximation for Maximum Independent Set. We prove
that the PLB-U property suffices for the greedy approach to achieve a
constant-factor approximation for all three problems. We also show that all
three combinatorial optimization problems are APX-complete, even if all
PLB-properties hold.

In a previous paper we presented the observations and models; in this paper we
explore the parameter space of these models. We first quantify uncertainties on
the black hole masses (M$_{\rm BH}$) and degeneracies between SED parameters.
The effect of BH spin is tested, and we find that while low to moderate spin
values (a$_*$ $\leq$ 0.9) are compatible with the data in all cases, maximal
spin (a$_*$ = 0.998) can only describe the data if the accretion disc is
face-on. The outer accretion disc radii are well constrained in 8/11 objects,
and are found to be a factor ~5 smaller than the self-gravity radii. We then
extend our modelling campaign into the mid-IR regime with WISE photometry,
adding components for the host galaxy and dusty torus. Our estimates of the
host galaxy luminosities are consistent with the M$_{\rm BH}$-bulge
relationship, and the measured torus properties (covering factor and
temperatures) are in agreement with earlier work, suggesting a predominantly
silicate-based grain composition. Finally, we deconvolve the optical-NIR
spectra using our SED continuum model. We claim that this is a more physically
motivated approach than using empirical descriptions of the continuum such as
broken power-laws. For our small sample, we verify previously noted
correlations between emission linewidths and luminosities commonly used for
single-epoch M$_{\rm BH}$ estimates, and observe a statistically significant
anti-correlation between [O III] equivalent width and AGN luminosity.

Galaxy And Mass Assembly (GAMA) survey, using the weak gravitational lensing
signal measured from the overlapping Kilo Degree Survey (KiDS). To do so, we
quantify the azimuthal dependence of the stacked lensing signal around seven
different proxies for the orientation of the dark matter distribution, as it is
a priori unknown which one traces the orientation best. On small scales, the
major axis of the brightest group/cluster member (BCG) provides the best proxy,
leading to a clear detection of an anisotropic signal. In order to relate that
to a halo ellipticity, we have to adopt a model density profile. We derive new
expressions for the quadrupole moments of the shear field given an elliptical
model surface mass density profile. Modeling the signal with an elliptical
Navarro-Frenk-White (NFW) profile on scales < 250 kpc, which roughly
corresponds to half the virial radius, and assuming that the BCG is perfectly
aligned with the dark matter, we find an average halo ellipticity of e_h=0.38
+/- 0.12. This agrees well with results from cold-dark-matter-only simulations,
which typically report values of e_h ~ 0.3. On larger scales, the lensing
signal around the BCGs does not trace the dark matter distribution well, and
the distribution of group satellites provides a better proxy for the halo's
orientation instead, leading to a 3--4 sigma detection of a non-zero halo
ellipticity at scales between 250 kpc and 750 kpc. Our results suggest that the
distribution of stars enclosed within a certain radius forms a good proxy for
the orientation of the dark matter within that radius, which has also been
observed in hydrodynamical simulations.

the most general theory of inflationary fluctuations when time-translations and
supersymmetry are spontaneously broken. The non-linear realization of these
invariances allows us to define a complete SUGRA multiplet containing the
graviton, the gravitino, the Goldstone of time translations and the Goldstino,
with no auxiliary fields. Going to a unitary gauge where only the graviton and
the gravitino are present, we write the most general Lagrangian built out of
the fluctuations of these fields, invariant under time-dependent spatial
diffeomorphisms, but softly-breaking time diffeomorphisms and gauged SUSY. With
a suitable St\""uckelberg transformation, we introduce the Goldstone boson of
time translation and the Goldstino of SUSY. No additional dynamical light field
is needed. In the high energy limit, larger than the inflationary Hubble scale
for the Goldstino, these fields decouple from the graviton and the gravitino,
greatly simplifying the analysis in this regime. We study the phenomenology of
this Lagrangian. The Goldstino can have a non-relativistic dispersion relation.
Gravitino and Goldstino affect the primordial curvature perturbations at loop
level. The UV modes running in the loops generate three-point functions which
are degenerate with the ones coming from operators already present in the
absence of supersymmetry. Their size is potentially as large as corresponding
to $f_{\rm NL}^{\rm equil.,\,orthog.}\sim 1$ or, for particular operators, even
$\gg 1$. The non-degenerate contribution from modes of order $H$ is estimated

requires the efficient generation of current-driven spin-torques. In magnetic
structures based on topological insulators (TIs) current-induced spin-orbit
torques can be generated. Here we show that the addition of graphene, or
bilayer graphene, to a TI-based magnetic structure greatly enhances the
current-induced spin density accumulation and significantly reduces the amount
of power dissipated. We find that this enhancement can be as high as a factor
of 100, giving rise to a giant Edelstein effect. Such a large enhancement is
due to the high mobility of graphene (bilayer graphene) and to the fact that
the graphene (bilayer graphene) sheet very effectively screens charge
impurities, the dominant source of disorder in topological insulators. Our
results show that the integration of graphene in spintronics devices can
greatly enhance their performance and functionalities.

formation history, an effect known as assembly bias. We use zoom N -body
simulations to investigate the origin of this phenomenon. For each halo at
redshift z=0, we determine the time in which the physical volume containing its
final mass becomes stable. We consider five examples for which this happens at
z~1.5 and two that do not stabilize by z=0. The zoom simulations show that
early-collapsing haloes do not grow in mass at z=0 while late-forming ones show
a net inflow. The reason is that 'accreting' haloes are located at the nodes of
a network of thin filaments feeding them. Conversely, each 'stalled' halo lies
within a prominent filament that is thicker than the halo size. Infalling
material from the surroundings becomes part of the filament while matter within
it recedes from the halo. We conclude that assembly bias originates from
quenching halo growth due to tidal forces following the formation of non-linear
structures in the cosmic web, as previously conjectured in the literature. Also
the internal dynamics of the haloes change: the velocity anisotropy profile is
biased towards radial (tangential) orbits in accreting (stalled) haloes. Our
findings reveal the cause of the yet unexplained dependence of halo clustering
on the anisotropy. Finally, we extend the excursion-set theory to account for
these effects. A simple criterion based on the ellipticity of the linear tidal
field combined with the spherical collapse model provides excellent predictions
for both classes of haloes.

non-equilibrium fluctuations in the gravitational potential. Using cosmological
zoom-in baryonic simulations from the Feedback in Realistic Environments (FIRE)
project, we investigate how these fluctuations affect stellar kinematics and
the reliability of Jeans dynamical modeling in low-mass galaxies. We find that
stellar velocity dispersion and anisotropy profiles fluctuate significantly
over the course of galaxies' starburst cycles. We therefore predict an
observable correlation between star formation rate and stellar kinematics:
dwarf galaxies with higher recent star formation rates should have systemically
higher stellar velocity dispersions. This prediction provides an observational
test of the role of stellar feedback in regulating both stellar and dark-matter
densities in dwarf galaxies. We find that Jeans modeling, which treats galaxies
as virialized systems in dynamical equilibrium, overestimates a galaxy's
dynamical mass during periods of post-starburst gas outflow and underestimates
it during periods of net inflow. Short-timescale potential fluctuations lead to
typical errors of $\sim 20\%$ in dynamical mass estimates, even if full
3-dimensional stellar kinematics -- including the orbital anisotropy -- are
known exactly. When orbital anisotropy is $\textit{not}$ known a priori,
typical mass errors arising from non-equilibrium fluctuations in the potential
are larger than those arising from the mass-anisotropy degeneracy. However,
Jeans modeling alone $\textit{cannot}$ reliably constrain the orbital
anisotropy, and problematically, it often favors anisotropy models that do not
reflect the true profile. If galaxies completely lose their gas and cease
forming stars, fluctuations in the potential subside, and Jeans modeling
becomes much more reliable.

development of efficient speckle subtraction techniques in data reduction has
enabled final contrasts of up to 10-6 to be obtained, however it remains
preferable to eliminate the underlying NCPEs at the source. In this work we
introduce the coronagraphic Modal Wavefront Sensor (cMWS), a new wavefront
sensor suitable for real-time NCPE correction. This pupil-plane optic combines
the apodizing phase plate coronagraph with a holographic modal wavefront
sensor, to provide simultaneous coronagraphic imaging and focal-plane wavefront
sensing using the science point spread function. We first characterise the
baseline performance of the cMWS via idealised closed-loop simulations, showing
that the sensor successfully recovers diffraction-limited coronagraph
performance over an effective dynamic range of +/-2.5 radians root-mean-square
(RMS) wavefront error within 2-10 iterations. We then present the results of
initial on-sky testing at the William Herschel Telescope, and demonstrate that
the sensor is able to retrieve injected wavefront aberrations to an accuracy of
10nm RMS under realistic seeing conditions. We also find that the cMWS is
capable of real-time broadband measurement of atmospheric wavefront variance at
a cadence of 50Hz across an uncorrected telescope sub-aperture. When combined
with a suitable closed-loop adaptive optics system, the cMWS holds the
potential to deliver an improvement in raw contrast of up to two orders of

happen. In this case, the power-law behavior is caused by bounds in the energy
spectrum. Decays with $\gamma < 1$ emerge when the energy eigenstates are
correlated and signal lack of ergodicity. They are typical of systems
undergoing localization due to strong onsite disorder and are found also in

scales, feedback traps are the best way to trap single molecules without

subject a target object to forces that are calculated to be the gradient of a
desired potential function U(x). If the feedback loop is fast enough, it
creates a virtual potential whose dynamics will be very close to those of a

thermodynamics, quantum coherence, and asymmetry, is to find necessary and
sufficient conditions (NSC) that determine whether one resource can be
converted to another by the set of free operations. Here we find such NSC for a
large class of quantum resource theories which we call affine resource theories
(ART). ARTs include the resource theories of athermality, asymmetry, and
coherence, but not entanglement. Remarkably, the NSC can be expressed as a
family of inequalities between resource monotones (quantifiers) that are given
in terms of the conditional min entropy. The set of free operations is taken to
be (1) the maximal set (i.e. consists of all resource non-generating (RNG)
quantum channels) or (2) the self-dual set of free operations (i.e. consists of
all RNG maps for which the dual map is also RNG). As an example, we apply our
results to quantum thermodynamics with Gibbs preserving operations, and several
other ARTs. Finally, we discuss the applications of these results to resource
theories that are not affine, and along the way, provide the NSC that a quantum
resource theory consists of a resource destroying map.

swimming patterns. Our studies are based on two-dimensional simulations of
viscous incompressible flows. We distinguish between motion patterns that are
externally imposed on the swimmers and self-propelled swimmers that learn
manoeuvres to achieve certain goals. Simulations of two rigid bodies executing
pre-specified motion indicate that flow-mediated interactions can lead to
substantial drag reduction and may even generate thrust intermittently. In turn
we examine two self-propelled swimmers arranged in a leader-follower
configuration, with a-priori specified body-deformations. We find that the
swimming of the leader remains largely unaffected, while the follower
experiences either an increase or decrease in swimming speed, depending on the
initial conditions. Finally, we consider a follower that synchronises its
motion so as to minimise its lateral deviations from the leader's path. The
leader employs a steady gait while the follower uses a reinforcement learning
algorithm to adapt its swimming-kinematics. We find that swimming in a
synchronised tandem can yield up to about 30% reduction in energy expenditure
for the follower, in addition to a 20% increase in its swimming-efficiency. The
present results indicate that synchronised swimming of two fish can be
energetically beneficial.

such as inflammatory response, wound healing, cancer metastasis and
embryogenesis. These are biological demonstrations of the unjamming transition.
However, contradictory to the typical density-driven jamming processes in
particulate assemblies, cellular systems often get unjammed in highly packed,
sometimes overcrowding tissue environments. In this work, we report that
overcrowding can unjam gap-free monolayers through increasing isotropic
compression. The transition boundary is determined by the isotropic compression
and the cell-cell adhesion. We explicitly construct the free energy landscape
for the T1 topological transition during monolayer rearrangement, and find that
it evolves from single-barrier shape to double-barrier shape upon completion of
the unjamming process. Our analyses reveal that the overcrowding and adhesion
induced unjamming transition reflects the mechanical yielding of the highly
deformable monolayer, which differs from those caused by loosing up a packed
particulate assembly.

streamlined music designed to reduce exogenous attention and improve endogenous
attention. Although anecdotal reports suggest that streamlined music does
indeed improve focus on daily work tasks and may improve mood, the specific
influences of streamlined music on cognition and mood have yet to be examined.
In this paper, we report the results of a series of online experiments that
examined the impact of one form of streamlined music on cognition and mood. The
tested form of streamlined music, which was tested primarily by listeners who
felt they benefited from this type of music, significantly outperformed plain
music on measures of perceived focus, task persistence, precognition, and
creative thinking, with borderline effects on mood. In contrast, this same form
of streamlined music did not significantly influence measures assessing visual
attention, verbal memory, logical thinking, self-efficacy, perceived stress, or
self-transcendence. We also found that improvements in perceived focus over a
2-month period were correlated with improvements in emotional state, including
mood. Overall the results suggest that at least for individuals who enjoy using
streamlined music as a focus tool, streamlined music can have a beneficial
impact on cognition without any obvious costs, while at the same time it may
potentially boost mood.

examples, inputs that look normal but cause an incorrect classification by the

hand-written digits on a scanned check being incorrectly classified but looking
normal when humans see them. This research assesses the extent to which
adversarial examples pose a security threat, when one considers the normal
image acquisition process. This process is mimicked by simulating the
transformations that normally occur in acquiring the image in a real world
application, such as using a scanner to acquire digits for a check amount or
using a camera in an autonomous car. These small transformations negate the
effect of the carefully crafted perturbations of adversarial examples,
resulting in a correct classification by the deep neural network. Thus just
acquiring the image decreases the potential impact of the proposed security
threat. We also show that the already widely used process of averaging over
multiple crops neutralizes most adversarial examples. Normal preprocessing,
such as text binarization, almost completely neutralizes adversarial examples.
This is the first paper to show that for text driven classification,
adversarial examples are an academic curiosity, not a security threat.

  network",,,,,"q-bio.NC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Unraveling the interplay of excitation and inhibition within
rhythm-generating networks remains a fundamental issue in neuroscience. We use
a biophysical model to investigate the different roles of local and long-range
inhibition in the respiratory network, a key component of which is the
pre-B\""otzinger complex inspiratory microcircuit. Increasing inhibition within
the microcircuit results in a limited number of out-of-phase neurons before
rhythmicity and synchrony degenerate. Thus, unstructured local inhibition is
destabilizing and cannot support the generation of more than one rhythm. A
two-phase rhythm requires restructuring the network into two microcircuits
coupled by long-range inhibition in the manner of a half-center. In this
context, inhibition leads to greater stability of the two out-of-phase rhythms.
We support our computational results with in vitro recordings from mouse
pre-B\""otzinger complex. Partial excitation block leads to increased rhythmic
variability, but this recovers following blockade of inhibition. Our results
support the idea that local inhibition in the pre-B\""otzinger complex is
present to allow for descending control of synchrony or robustness to adverse
conditions like hypoxia. We conclude that the balance of inhibition and
excitation determines the stability of rhythmogenesis, but with opposite roles
within and between areas. These different inhibitory roles may apply to a
variety of rhythmic behaviors that emerge in widespread pattern generating
circuits of the nervous system.

comprehensive study of how tidal stripping removes dark matter and stars from

typically lose only 10$\%$ of their stars. This is because the dark matter halo
is initially much more extended than the stars. As such, we find the
stellar-to-halo size-ratio (measured using r$_{\rm{eff}}$/r$_{\rm{vir}}$) is a
key parameter controlling the relative amounts of dark matter and stellar
stripping. We use simple fitting formulae to measure the relation between the
fraction of bound dark matter and fraction of bound stars. We measure a
negligible dependence on cluster mass or galaxy mass. Therefore these formulae
have general applicability in cosmological simulations, and are ideal to
improve stellar stripping recipes in semi-analytical models, and/or to estimate
the impact that tidal stripping would have on galaxies when only their halo

methods using two different methods: Jeans anisotropic dynamical modeling and
axisymmetric Schwarzschild modeling. Both modeling methods give consistent
results, but we cannot constrain the lower mass limit and only measure an upper
limit for the black hole mass of Mbh= 1.56 x 10^6 Msun(at 3 sigma level) which
is at least 1 sigma below the recent Mbh-sigma_e relations. Further tests with
dark matter, mass-to-light ratio variation and different light models confirm
that our results are not dominated by uncertainties. The derived upper limit
mass is not only below the Mbh-sigma_e relation, but is also five times lower
than the lower limit black hole mass anticipated from the resolution limit of
the sphere of influence. This proves that via high quality integral field data
we are now able to push black hole measurements down to at least five times
less than the resolution limit.

on defining admissible methods to be those methods that abide to the axioms of
value - nodes in a metric space with two nodes are clustered together at the
convex combination of the distance bounds between them - and transformation -
when both distance bounds are reduced, the output may become more clustered but
not less. Two admissible methods are constructed and are shown to provide
universal upper and lower bounds in the space of admissible methods. Practical
implications are explored by clustering moving points via snapshots and by
clustering networks representing brain structural connectivity using the lower

for the billiard flow on the unit flat torus with two, disjoint and orthogonal
cylindrical scatterers removed from it.
  The natural habitat for these objects is the infinite cone erected upon the
Cantor set $\text{Ends}(G)$ of all ""ends"" of the hyperbolic group
$G=\pi_1(\mathbf{Q})$. An element of $\text{Ends}(G)$ describes the direction
in (the Cayley graph of) the group $G$ in which the considered trajectory
escapes to infinity, whereas the height function $s$ ($s\ge 0$) of the cone
gives us the average speed at which this escape takes place.
  The main results of this paper claim that the orbits can only escape to
infinity at a speed not exceeding $\sqrt{3}$, and in any direction
$e\in\text{Ends}(\pi_1(\mathcal{Q}))$ the escape is feasible with any
prescribed speed $s$, $0\leq s\leq\dfrac{1}{\sqrt{6}+2\sqrt{3}}$. This means
that the radial upper and lower bounds for the rotation set $R$ are actually
pretty close to each other. Furthermore, we prove the convexity of the set $AR$
of constructible rotation vectors, and that the set of rotation vectors of
periodic orbits is dense in $AR$. We also provide effective lower and upper

in a quantum system by looking at individual eigenstates. However, it is also
important to consider how local observables reach equilibrium values
dynamically. Quench protocol is one of the settings to study such questions. A
recent numerical study [Ba\~{n}uls, Cirac, and Hastings, Phys. Rev. Lett. 106,
050405 (2011)] of a nonintegrable quantum Ising model with longitudinal field
under such quench setting found different behaviors for different initial
quantum states. One particular case called ""weak thermalization"" regime showed
apparently persistent oscillations of some observables. Here we provide an
explanation of such oscillations. We note that the corresponding initial state
has low energy density relative to the ground state of the model. We then use
perturbation theory near the ground state and identify the oscillation
frequency as essentially a quasiparticle gap. With this quasiparticle picture,
we can then address the long-time behavior of the oscillations. Upon making
additional approximations which intuitively should only make thermalization
weaker, we argue that the oscillations nevertheless decay in the long time
limit. As part of our arguments, we also consider a quench from a BEC to a
hard-core boson model in one dimension. We find that the expectation value of a
single-boson creation operator oscillates but decays exponentially in time,
while a pair-boson creation operator has oscillations with a $t^{-3/2}$ decay
in time. We also study dependence of the decay time on the density of bosons in
the low-density regime and use this to estimate decay time for oscillations in
the original spin model.

instability excites a stellar mode by sourcing an acoustic wave in the disk at
the boundary layer, which carries a flux of energy and angular momentum with
the opposite sign as the energy and angular momentum density of the stellar
mode. We call this instability the acoustic CFS instability, because of the
direct analogy to the Chandrasekhar-Friedman-Schutz instability for exciting
modes on a rotating star by emission of energy in the form of gravitational
waves. However, the acoustic CFS instability differs from its gravitational
wave counterpart in that the fluid medium in which the acoustic wave propagates
(i.e.\ the accretion disk) typically rotates faster than the star in which the
incompressible mode is sourced. For this reason, the instability can operate
even for a non-rotating star in the presence of an accretion disk. We discuss

models of the proteasome in which the complex is represented by an effective
potential with an added pulling force. This force is meant to induce
translocation of a protein or a polypeptide into the catalytic chamber. The
force is either constant or applied periodically. The translocated proteins are
modelled in a coarse-grained fashion. We do comparative analysis of several
knotted globular proteins and the transiently knotted polyglutamine tracts of
length 60 alone and fused in exon 1 of the huntingtin protein. Huntingtin is
associated with Huntington disease, a well-known genetically-determined
neurodegenerative disease. We show that the presence of a knot hinders and
sometimes even jams translocation. We demonstrate that the probability to do so
depends on the protein, the model of the proteasome, the magnitude of the
pulling force, and the choice of the pulled terminus. In any case, the net
effect would be a hindrance in the proteasomal degradation process in the cell.
This would then yield toxicity \textit{via} two different mechanisms: one
through toxic monomers compromising degradation and another by the formation of
toxic oligomers. Our work paves the way to the mechanistic investigation of the
mechanical unfolding of knotted structures by the proteasome and its relation
to toxicity and disease.

(such as a Dirac monopole) as well as a Yukawa-like potential(s) representing
the typical effects of strong interactions. This system, due to the presence of
a short-range potential, can be analyzed using the powerful technique of the
complex angular momenta which, so far, has not been employed in the presence of
monopoles (nor of other topological solitons). Due to the fact that spatial
spherical symmetry is achieved only up to internal rotations, the partial wave
expansion becomes very similar to the Jacob-Wick helicity amplitudes for
particles with spin. However, since the angular-momentum operator has an extra
""internal"" contribution, fixed cuts in the complex angular momentum plane
appear. Correspondingly, the background integral in the Regge formula does not
decrease for large values of cos(Theta) (namely, large values of the Mandelstam
variable s). Hence, the experimental observation of this kind of behavior could
be a direct signal of non-trivial topological structures in strong
interactions. The possible relations of these results with the soft Pomeron are
shortly analyzed.

hydrodynamics of an astrophysical object irradiated by a radiation field with
an arbitrary strength and spectral energy distribution (SED). Using the XSTAR
photoionization code, we calculate heating and cooling rates as a function of
gas photoionization parameter and temperature for several examples of SEDs:
bremsstrahlung, blackbody, hard and soft state XRBs, Type 1 and Type 2 AGN. As
an application of our method we study the hydrodynamics of 1-dimensional
spherical winds heated by a uniform radiation field using the code Athena++. We
find that in all cases explored a wind settles into a transonic, steady state.
The wind evolves along the radiative heating equilibrium curve until adiabatic
cooling effects become important and the flow departs from radiative
equilibrium. If the flow is heated very rapidly, for example as in a thermally
unstable regime, the corresponding column density of gas is low. Perhaps one of
the most intriguing results of our work is the two stage acceleration of the
wind that happens when there are two thermally unstable regions and the flux is
relatively high. The efficiency with which the radiation field transfers energy
to the wind is dependent on the SED of the external source, particularly the
relative flux of soft X-rays. These results suggest that detailed
photoionization calculations are essential not only to predict spectra but also
to properly capture the flow dynamics.

traversed by the undetected photon. The fringe shift is characterized by a
combination of wavelengths of both photons, which implies that the wavelength

of the fringes diminishes as the correlation between the transverse momenta of
twin photons decreases: visibility is unity for maximum momentum correlation
and zero for no momentum correlation. We also show that the momentum

electron cyclotron maser emission (ECME) by the electrons that produce hard
X-ray bursts as they precipitate into the chromosphere in the impulsive phase
of a solar flare. Spike bursts are regarded as analogous to the auroral
kilometric radiation (AKR), which is associated with the precipitation of
auroral electrons in a geomagnetic substorm. Originally, a loss-cone-driven
version of ECME, developed for AKR, was applied to spike bursts, but it is now
widely accepted that a different, horseshoe-driven, version of EMCE applies to
AKR. We explore the implications of the assumption that horseshoe-driven ECME
also applies to spike bursts. We develop a 1D model for the acceleration of the
electrons by a parallel electric field, and show that under plausible
assumptions it leads to a horseshoe distribution of electrons in a solar flare.
A second requirement for horseshoe-driven ECME is an extremely low plasma
density, referred to as a density cavity. We argue that a coronal density
cavity should develop in association with a hard X-ray burst, and that such a
density cavity can overcome a long-standing problem with the escape of ECME
through the second-harmonic absorption layer. Both the horseshoe distribution
and the associated coronal density cavity are highly localized, and could not
be resolved in the statistically large number of local precipitation regions
needed to explain a hard X-ray burst. The model highlights the ""number problem""
in the supply of the electrons needed to explain a hard X-ray burst.

applications when running in clouds. This problem is caused by concurrent
access performed by co-located applications to shared and non-sliceable
resources such as cache and memory. In order to address this issue, some works
adopted a qualitative approach that does not take into account the amount of
access to shared resources. In addition, a few works, even considering the
amount of access, evaluated just the SLLC access contention as the root of this
problem. However, our experiments revealed that interference is intrinsically
related to the amount of simultaneous access to shared resources, besides
showing that another shared resources, apart from SLLC, can also influence the
interference suffered by co-located applications. In this paper, we present a
quantitative model for predicting cross-application interference in virtual
environments. Our proposed model takes into account the amount of simultaneous
access to SLLC, DRAM and virtual network, and the similarity of application's
access burden to predict the level of interference suffered by applications

all wavelengths from radio to gamma-rays. Polarized radiation from blazars is
one key piece of evidence for synchrotron radiation at low energies and it also
varies dramatically. The polarization of blazars is of interest for
understanding the origin, confinement, and propagation of jets. However, even
though numerous measurements have been performed, the mechanisms behind jet
creation, composition and variability are still debated. We performed
simultaneous gamma-ray and optical photopolarimetry observations of 45 blazars

and search for a basic relation between the several subclasses of blazars. We
identify a correlation between the maximum degree of optical linear
polarization and the gamma-ray luminosity or the ratio of gamma-ray to optical
fluxes. Since the maximum polarization degree depends on the condition of the
magnetic field (chaotic or ordered), this result implies a systematic
difference in the intrinsic alignment of magnetic fields in pc-scale
relativistic jets between different types blazars (FSRQs vs. BL Lacs), and
consequently between different types of radio galaxies (FR Is vs. FR IIs).

waves plays an important role in determining impulsively generated wave trains,
which have often been invoked to account for quasi-periodic signals in coronal
loops. We examine how the group speeds ($v_{\rm gr}$) depend on angular
frequency ($\omega$) for sausage modes in pressureless coronal tubes with
continuous transverse density distributions by solving the dispersion relation
pertinent to the case where the density inhomogeneity of arbitrary form takes
place in a transition layer of arbitrary thickness. We find that in addition to
the transverse lengthscale $l$ and density contrast $\rho_{\rm i}/\rho_{\rm
e}$, the group speed behavior depends also on the detailed form of the density
inhomogeneity. For parabolic profiles, $v_{\rm gr}$ always decreases with
$\omega$ first before increasing again, as happens for the much studied top-hat
profiles. For linear profiles, however, the behavior of the $\omega-v_{\rm gr}$
curves is more complex. When $\rho_{\rm i}/\rho_{\rm e} \lesssim 6$, the curves
become monotonical for large values of $l$. On the other hand, for higher
density contrasts, a local maximum $v_{\rm gr}^{\rm max}$ exists in addition to
a local minimum $v_{\rm gr}^{\rm min}$ when coronal tubes are diffuse. With
time-dependent computations, we show that the different behavior of group speed
curves, the characteristic speeds $v_{\rm gr}^{\rm min}$ and $v_{\rm gr}^{\rm
max}$ in particular, is reflected in the temporal evolution and Morlet spectra
of impulsively generated wave trains. We conclude that the observed
quasi-periodic wave trains not only can be employed to probe such key
parameters as density contrasts and profile steepness, but also have the
potential to discriminate between the unknown forms of the transverse density
distribution.

turned into an unconstrained minimization problem. The grain boundary
dislocation structure is approximated by a network of straight dislocations

chemical species in stellar radiation zones, as discussed by Zahn (1974). In
this paper we analyze the results of direct numerical simulations of stratified
plane Couette flows, in the limit of rapid thermal diffusion, to measure the
turbulent diffusivity and turbulent viscosity as a function of the local shear
and the local stratification. We find that the stability criterion proposed by
Zahn (1974), namely that the product of the gradient Richardson number and the
Prandtl number must be smaller than a critical values $(J\Pr)_c$ for
instability, adequately accounts for the transition to turbulence in the flow,
with $(J\Pr)_c \simeq 0.007$. This result recovers and confirms the prior
findings of Prat et al. (2016). Zahn's model for the turbulent diffusivity and
viscosity (Zahn 1992), namely that the mixing coefficient should be
proportional to the ratio of the thermal diffusivity to the gradient Richardson
number, does not satisfactorily match our numerical data when applied as is. It
fails (as expected) in the limit of large stratification where the Richardson
number exceeds the aforementioned threshold for instability, but it also fails
in the limit of low stratification where the turbulent eddy scale becomes
limited by the computational domain size. We propose a revised model for
turbulent mixing by diffusive stratified shear instabilities, that now properly
accounts for both limits, fits our data satisfactorily, and recovers Zahn's
1992 model in the limit of large Reynolds numbers.

of training a single classifier on face images to classify them based on the
features of the person whose face appears in the image, we first train four
different classifiers for classifying face images based on race, age, gender
and identification (ID). Multi-task features are then extracted from the
trained models and cross-task-feature training is conducted which shows the
value of fusing multimodal features extracted from multi-tasks. We have found
that features trained for one task can be used for other related tasks. More
interestingly, the features trained for a task with more classes (e.g. ID) and
then used in another task with fewer classes (e.g. race) outperforms the
features trained for the other task itself. The final feature fusion is
performed by combining the four types of features extracted from the images by
the four classifiers. The feature fusion approach improves the classifications
accuracy by a 7.2%, 20.1%, 22.2%, 21.8% margin, respectively, for ID, age, race

event by using a speckle-masking image reconstruction, we identified
white-light (WL) flare ribbons on opposite sides of the magnetic neutral line.
We derive the lightcurve decay times of the WL flare kernels at each resolution
element by assuming that the kernels consist of one or two components that
decay exponentially, starting from the peak time. As a result, 42% of the
pixels have two decay-time components with average decay times of 15.6 and 587
s, whereas the average decay time is 254 s for WL kernels with only one
decay-time component. The peak intensities of the shorter decay-time component
exhibit good spatial correlation with the WL intensity, whereas the peak
intensities of the long decay-time components tend to be larger in the early
phase of the flare at the inner part of the flare ribbons, close to the
magnetic neutral line. The average intensity of the longer decay-time
components is 1.78 times higher than that of the shorter decay-time components.
If the shorter decay time is determined by either the chromospheric cooling
time or the nonthermal ionization timescale and the longer decay time is
attributed to the coronal cooling time, this result suggests that WL sources
from both regions appear in 42% of the WL kernels and that WL emission of the
coronal origin is sometimes stronger than that of chromospheric origin.

challenges arising in the study of such networks is the inference of
macroscopic, large-scale properties affecting a large number of objects, based
solely on the microscopic interactions between their elementary constituents.
Statistical physics, precisely created to recover the macroscopic laws of
thermodynamics from an idealized model of interacting particles, provides
significant insight to tackle such complex networks.
  In this dissertation, we use methods derived from the statistical physics of
disordered systems to design and study new algorithms for inference on graphs.
Our focus is on spectral methods, based on certain eigenvectors of carefully
chosen matrices, and sparse graphs, containing only a small amount of
information. We develop an original theory of spectral inference based on a
relaxation of various mean-field free energy optimizations. Our approach is
therefore fully probabilistic, and contrasts with more traditional motivations
based on the optimization of a cost function. We illustrate the efficiency of
our approach on various problems, including community detection, randomized
similarity-based clustering, and matrix completion.

in the Fock space of a small disordered Bose-Hubbard system consisting of four
sites and containing five particles. This many-body interference phenomenon can
most conveniently be seen in time evolution processes that start from a Fock
state of the Bose-Hubbard system. It manifests itself in an enhanced detection
probability of this initial state as compared to other Fock states with
comparable total energy. We argue that coherent backscattering in Fock space
can be experimentally measured with ultracold bosonic atoms in optical lattices
using state-of-the-art single-site detection techniques. A synthetic gauge
field can be induced in order to break time-reversal symmetry within the
lattice and thereby destroy coherent backscattering. While this many-body
interference effect is most prominently visible in the presence of eigenstate
thermalization, we briefly discuss its significance in the opposite regime of
many-body localization.

introduction, we will distinguish single charge sources from coherent single
electrons sources. The former have been developed for quantum metrology where
the goal is to transfer an integer charge at high frequency f through a

over 350 eV, we reveal the 3D Fermi surface in SrIrO$_3$ and $k_z$-dependent
oscillations of photoelectron intensity in Sr$_3$Ir$_2$O$_7$. In contrast to
previously reported results obtained using low-energy photons, folded bands
derived from lattice distortions and/or magnetic ordering make significantly
weak (but finite) contributions to the $k$-resolved photoemission spectrum. At
the first glance, this leads to the ambiguous result that the observed
$k$-space topology is consistent with the unfolded Brillouin zone (BZ) picture
derived from a non-realistic simple square or cubic Ir lattice. Through careful
analysis, we determine that a superposition of the folded and unfolded band
structures has been observed in the ARPES spectra obtained using photons in
both ultraviolet and SX regions. To corroborate the physics deduced using
low-energy ARPES studies, we propose to utilize SX-ARPES as a powerful
complementary technique, as this method surveys more than one whole BZ and
provides a panoramic view of electronic structures.

arbitrary rings, Case 2: for rings of functions over topo- logical manifolds.
Case 1 produces general index theorems, as for example, over pseudo-manifolds.
Case 2 gives a general treatment of classical and non- commutative index

of the theory would contain: local $T^{\ast}$ -theory, local peri- odic cyclic

particularly for the reporting of carbon stocks and changes. AGB can be mapped
using synthetic aperture radar data (SAR) or passive optical data. However,
these data are insensitive to high AGB levels (\textgreater{}150 Mg/ha, and
\textgreater{}300 Mg/ha for P-band), which are commonly found in tropical
forests. Studies have mapped the rough variations in AGB by combining optical
and environmental data at regional and global scales. Nevertheless, these maps
cannot represent local variations in AGB in tropical forests. In this paper, we
hypothesize that the problem of misrepresenting local variations in AGB and AGB
estimation with good precision occurs because of both methodological limits
(signal saturation or dilution bias) and a lack of adequate calibration data in
this range of AGB values. We test this hypothesis by developing a calibrated
regression model to predict variations in high AGB values (mean
\textgreater{}300 Mg/ha) in French Guiana by a methodological approach for
spatial extrapolation with data from the optical geoscience laser altimeter
system (GLAS), forest inventories, radar, optics, and environmental variables
for spatial inter-and extrapolation. Given their higher point count, GLAS data
allow a wider coverage of AGB values. We find that the metrics from GLAS
footprints are correlated with field AGB estimations (R 2 =0.54, RMSE=48.3
Mg/ha) with no bias for high values. First, predictive models, including
remote-sensing, environmental variables and spatial correlation functions,
allow us to obtain ""wall-to-wall"" AGB maps over French Guiana with an RMSE for
the in situ AGB estimates of ~51 Mg/ha and R${}^2$=0.48 at a 1-km grid size. We
conclude that a calibrated regression model based on GLAS with dependent
environmental data can produce good AGB predictions even for high AGB values if
the calibration data fit the AGB range. We also demonstrate that small temporal
and spatial mismatches between field data and GLAS footprints are not a problem
for regional and global calibrated regression models because field data aim to
predict large and deep tendencies in AGB variations from environmental
gradients and do not aim to represent high but stochastic and temporally
limited variations from forest dynamics. Thus, we advocate including a greater
variety of data, even if less precise and shifted, to better represent high AGB
values in global models and to improve the fitting of these models for high
values.

gives a unique opportunity to detect large-$N$ physics without complexity in
realistic materials. In the present work, high temperature physical feature of
standard ($SU(2)$) PAM with harmonic trapping potential is detailed analyzed by
quantum Monte Carlo and dynamic mean-field theory. Indications for near-future

becomes more complicated if the space-time coding is also involved with the
optimization in a multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) system. This is because
the number of ways of jointly assigning channels codes and space-time codes to
progressive packets is much larger than that of solely assigning channel codes
to the packets. We are unaware of any feasible and complete solution for such
optimization of joint source, channel, and space-time coding of progressive

optimization problem in a MIMO system. We use the parametric methodology to
derive some useful theoretical results, and then exploit those results to
propose an optimization method where the joint assignment of channel codes and
space-time codes to the packets can be optimized in a packet-by-packet manner.
As a result, the computational complexity of the optimization is exponentially
reduced, compared to the conventional exhaustive search. The numerical results
show that the proposed method significantly improves the peak-signal-to-noise
ratio performance of the rate-based optimal solution in a MIMO system.

combining theoretical arguments and numerical simulations, we reveal such
energy landscapes, which fully explain the bidirectional transport mechanism.

changing polytropic indices across a shock are physically allowed only for

mechanical systems. Based on the observation that mechanical systems are
essentially double integrator systems, we generalize the linear PID controller
to mechanical systems that have a non-Euclidean configuration space.
Specifically we start by presenting the development of the geometric PID
controller for fully actuated mechanical systems and then extend it to a class
of under actuated interconnected mechanical systems of practical significance
by introducing the notion of feedback regularization. We show that feedback
regularization is the mechanical system equivalent to partial feedback
linearization. We apply these results for trajectory tracking for several
systems of interest in the field of robotics. First, we demonstrate the robust
almost-global stability properties of the geometric PID controller developed
for fully actuated mechanical systems using simulations and experiments on a
multi-rotor-aerial-vehicle. The extension to the class of under actuated
interconnected systems allow one to ensure the semi-almost-global locally
exponential tracking of the geometric center of a spherical robot on an
inclined plane of unknown angle of inclination. The results are demonstrated
using simulations for a hoop rolling on an inclined plane and then for a sphere
rolling on an inclined plane. The final extension that we present here is that
of geometric PID control for holonomically or non-holonomically constrained
mechanical systems on Lie groups. The results are demonstrated by ensuring the
robust almost global locally exponential tracking of a nontrivial spherical
pendulum.

an invaluable output of flow simulations. One particular example of such
geometries involves self-propelled swimmers. Surface forces can provide
significant information about the flow field sensed by the swimmers, and are
difficult to obtain experimentally. At the same time, simulations of flow
around complex, deforming shapes can be computationally prohibitive when
body-fitted grids are used. Alternatively, such simulations may employ
penalization techniques. Penalization methods rely on simple Cartesian grids to
discretize the governing equations, which are enhanced by a penalty term to
account for the boundary conditions. They have been shown to provide a robust
estimation of mean quantities, such as drag and propulsion velocity, but the
computation of surface force distribution remains a challenge. We present a
method for determining flow- induced forces on the surface of both rigid and
deforming bodies, in simulations using re-meshed vortex methods and Brinkman
penalization. The pressure field is recovered from the velocity by solving a
Poisson's equation using the Green's function approach, augmented with a fast
multipole expansion and a tree- code algorithm. The viscous forces are
determined by evaluating the strain-rate tensor on the surface of deforming
bodies, and on a 'lifted' surface in simulations involving rigid objects. We
present results for benchmark flows demonstrating that we can obtain an
accurate distribution of flow-induced surface-forces. The capabilities of our
method are demonstrated using simulations of self-propelled swimmers, where we
obtain the pressure and shear distribution on their deforming surfaces.

sources of influence can be generally divided into external, which are
independent of social context, or as originating from peers, such as family and
friends. An important question is how to disentangle the social contagion by
peers from external influences. While a variety of experimental and
observational studies provided insight into this problem, identifying the
extent of social contagion based on large-scale observational data with an
unknown network structure remains largely unexplored. By bridging the gap
between the large-scale complex systems perspective of collective human
dynamics and the detailed approach of the social sciences, we present a
parsimonious model of social influence, and apply it to a central topic in
political science -- elections and voting behavior. We provide an analytical
expression of the county vote-share distribution in a two party system, which
is in excellent agreement with 92 years of observed U.S. presidential election
data. Analyzing the social influence topography over this period reveals an
abrupt transition in the patterns of social contagion -- from low to high
levels of social contagion. The results from our analysis reveal robust
differences among regions of the United States in terms of their social
influence index. In particular, we identify two regions of 'hot' and 'cold
spots of social influence, each comprising states that are geographically
close. These results suggest that social contagion effects are becoming more
instrumental in shaping large scale collective political behavior, which is at

cross section for each matter and dark energy due to formation of event

produced near event horizon of Universe is much larger for higher acceleration
of Universe. This is because as the acceleration of Universe becomes larger,
the Unruh temperature becomes larger and the thermal radiations of particles
are enhanced. There are different channels for producing Higgs boson in
accelerating Universe. Universe maybe decay to quark and gluons, and then these
particles interact with each other and Higgs boson is produced. Also, some
Higgs boson are emitted directly from event horizon of Universe. Comparing
Higgs boson cross sections via different channels, it is observed that at lower
acceleration, a_Universe<2.5 a_(early Universe), the Universe will not be able
to emit Higgs, but is still able to produce a quark and eventually for
a_Universe<1.5 a_(early Universe) the Universe can only emit massless gluons.
As the acceleration of Universe at the LHC increases, a_Universe>2.5 a_(early
Universe), most of Higgs boson production will be due to Unruh effect near
event horizon of Universe. Finally comparing the production cross section for
dark energy with particle cross sections, it is found that the cross section
for dark energy is dominated by QCD matter, Higgs boson and neutrino. This
result is consistent with previous predictions for dark energy cross section.

calls for an investigation of the formation of such progenitor systems in
general. We analyse the common envelope (CE) stage of the ""traditional""
formation channel in binaries where the first-formed compact object undergoes
an in-spiral inside the envelope of its evolved companion star and ejects the
envelope in that process. We calculate envelope binding energies of donor stars
with initial masses between 4 and 115 Msun for metallicities of Z=Zsun/2 and
Z=Zsun/50, and derive minimum masses of in-spiralling objects needed to eject
these envelopes. We find that CE evolution, besides from producing WD-WD and
NS-NS binaries, may, in principle, also produce massive BH-BH systems with
individual BH component masses up to ~50-60 Msun, in particular for donor stars
evolved to giants. However, the physics of envelope ejection of massive stars
remains uncertain. We discuss the applicability of the energy-budget formalism,
the location of the bifurcation point, the recombination energy and the
accretion energy during in-spiral as possible energy sources, and also comment
on the effect of inflated helium cores. Massive stars in a wide range of
metallicities and with initial masses up to at least 115 Msun may possibly shed
their envelopes and survive CE evolution, depending on their initial orbital
parameters, similarly to the situation for intermediate mass and low-mass stars
with degenerate cores. We conclude that based on stellar structure
calculations, and in the view of the usual simple energy budget analysis,
events like GW150914 and GW151226 could possibly be produced from the CE
channel. Calculations of post-CE orbital separations, however, and thus the
estimated LIGO detection rates, remain highly uncertain. [Abridged]

time dynamics of the universe. This approach is based upon the assumption of
constant value of cosmological jerk parameter, which is the dimensionless
representation of the 3rd order time derivative of the scale factor. For the
$\Lambda$CDM model, the value of jerk parameter is -1 throughout the evolution
history. Now any model dependent estimation of the value of the jerk parameter
would indicate the deviation of the model from the cosmological constant. In
the present work, it has also been shown that for a constant jerk parameter
model, any deviation of its value from -1 would not allow the dark matter to
have an independent conservation, thus indicating towards an interaction
between dark matter and dark energy. Statistical analysis with different
observational data sets (namely the observational Hubble parameter data (OHD),
the type Ia supernova data (SNe), and the baryon acoustic oscillation data
(BAO)) lead to a well constrained values of the jerk parameter and the model
remains at a very close proximity of the $\Lambda$CDM. The possibility of
interaction is found to be more likely at high redshift rather than at present
epoch.

  Our architecture splits control logic into light-weight control modules,
called controllets, based on a micro-kernel approach, reducing common
controllet functionality to a bare minimum and factoring out all higher-level
functionality. Light-weight controllets also allow for pushing control logic
onto switches to minimize latency and communication overhead. Controllets are
interconnected through a message bus supporting the publish/subscribe
communication paradigm with specific extensions for content-based OpenFlow
message filtering. Publish/subscribe allows for complete decoupling of

an observation that closely resembles the dynamical slowdown observed in
supercooled liquids, the phenomenon of kinetic arrest in Laponite suspensions
is accompanied by a growth in the $\alpha$-relaxation time with increasing
sample aging time, $t_{w}$. The ubiquitous dynamic slowdown and fragile
behavior observed in glass forming liquids approaching the glass transition is
typically ascribed to the growth in the size of distinct dynamical
heterogeneities. In this article, we present the characterization of the
dynamical heterogeneities in aging colloidal Laponite clay systems by invoking
the three-point dynamic susceptibility formalism. The average time-dependent
two-point intensity autocorrelation and its sensitivity to the control
parameter $t_{w}$ are probed in dynamic light scattering experiments.
Distributions of relaxation time scales deduced from Kohlrausch-Williams-Watts
equation widen with increasing $t_{w}$ signifying the heterogeneous dynamic
slowdown. A suitable formalism to calculate three-point correlation function is
employed for aging colloidal suspension where the main control parameter is
$t_{w}$. The calculated three-point dynamic susceptibility exhibits a peak,
with the peak height increasing with evolving $t_{w}$. The number of
dynamically correlated particles is seen to initially increase with increasing
$t_{w}$ at a fast rate, before eventually slowing down close to the non-ergodic
transition point.This observation is in agreement with reports on supercooled
liquids. Our study confirms the growth of dynamical heterogeneities in
suspensions of Laponite, thereby shedding new light on the fragile supercooled
liquid-like dynamics of aging suspensions of these anisotropic, charged,
colloidal clay nanoparticles.

  methods","12 pages, 6 figures, submitted",,,,"physics.flu-dyn","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We present a generalized picture of intermittency in turbulence that is based
on the theory of stochastic processes. To this end, we rely on the
experimentally and numerically verified finding by R.~Friedrich and J.~Peinke
[Phys. Rev. Lett. 78, 863 (1997)] that allows for an interpretation of the
turbulent energy cascade as a Markov process of the velocity increments in
scale. It is explicitly shown that all known phenomenological models of
turbulence can be reproduced by the Kramers-Moyal expansion of the velocity
increment probability density function that is associated to a Markov process.
We compare the different sets of Kramers-Moyal coefficients of each
phenomenology and deduce that an accurate description of intermittency should
take into account an infinite number of coefficients. This is demonstrated in
more detail for the case of Burgers turbulence that exhibits the strongest
intermittency effects. Moreover, the influence of nonlocality on the
Kramers-Moyal coefficients is investigated by direct numerical simulations of a
generalized Burgers equation. Depending on the balance between nonlinearity and
nonlocality, we encounter different intermittency behaviour that ranges from
self-similarity (purely nonlocal case) to intermittent behaviour (intermediate
case that agrees with Yakhot's mean field theory [Phys. Rev. E 63 026307
(2001)]) to shock-like behaviour (purely nonlinear Burgers case).

Technology developed earlier. Parameters of the fluctuations depended on the

closing by a cover and shielding from external electromagnetic fields [1-3].
Here we compared dynamics of physicochemical and morphological processes in
bulk. We observed microscopically periodic emergence, growth, aggregation and
disappearance of spherical cavities (50-250 micrometers in diameter) in bulk of
dispersion, which was followed by agreed fluctuations of physicochemical
parameters of the colloidal system. We have shown that those spheres were huge
hydrate covers of liquid crystal water around colloidal particles. Phase
transitions between free and bound (liquid crystal) water in a bulk of a
colloidal system is a pacemaker of fluctuations of its physicochemical
properties. These changes are regulated and coordinated by the value of osmotic
pressure. At low osmotic pressure hydrate covers grow, forcing out particles
and ions into the bulk; at high osmotic pressure they collapse to small size,
reducing osmotic pressure. Existence of self-oscillatory processes was
confirmed by a mathematical model.

Intersystem crossing in thymine occurs from the $S_1$ ($^1n\pi^*$) minimum, via
a nearby crossing with $T_2$ ($^3\pi\pi^*$). The system further relaxes via
ultrafast internal conversion in the triplet manifold to the $T_1$

in the $^1n\pi^*$ minimum, intersystem crossing might proceed with a time
constant of 1~ps. Furthermore, the change of the system's electronic state is
accompanied respectively by elongation/shortening of specific bonds, which
could thus be used as indicators to identify which state is populated in the

velocity variation, leaving a discrepancy between the observation and the
prediction. In this paper, we further characterise the microlensing system by
analysing its spectral energy distribution (SED) derived using the UVES
spectrum and new observations with the ARCoIRIS (CTIO) near-infrared
spectrograph and the Keck adaptive optics instrument NIRC2 in the J, H, and Ks
bands. We determine the mass and distance of the stars independently from the
microlensing modelling. We find that the SED is compatible with a giant star in
the Galactic bulge and a foreground star with a mass of 0.94+/-0.09Msun at a
distance of 1.07+/-0.24kpc. We find that this foreground star is likely the
lens. Its parameters are not compatible with the ones previously reported in
the literature (0.52+/-0.04Msun at 0.95+/-0.06kpc), based on the microlensing
light curve. A thoughtful re-analysis of the microlensing event is mandatory to
fully understand the reason of this new discrepancy. More importantly, this
paper demonstrates that spectroscopic follow-up observations of microlensing
events are possible and provide independent constraints on the parameters of
the lens and source stars, hence breaking some degeneracies in the analysis.
UV-to-NIR low-resolution spectrographs like X-SHOOTER (ESO - VLT) could
substantially contribute to this follow-up efforts, with magnitude limits above
all microlensing events detected so far.

This result is slightly smaller than that obtained earlier by Caderni and
Fabbri (1977). After the neutrino decoupling, when the Universe has entered the
photon era, kinetic-theory arguments no longer support the appearance of a bulk
viscosity. At high temperatures and a stable particle ratio, entropy production
(d$\sigma$/d$T$) goes as $T^{-8}$, with the total entropy ($\Delta \sigma$)

Internet facilities among different economic classes. In spite of having a
large mobile user base, the mobile Internet are still remarkably slower in some
of the developing countries. Especially in India, it falls below 50% even in
comparison with the performance of its developing counterparts!
  This essay presents a study of connectivity and performance trends based on
an exploratory analysis of mobile Internet measurement data from India. In
order to assess the state of mobile networks and its readiness in adopting the
different mobile standards (2G, 3G, and 4G) for commercial use, we discuss the
spread, penetration, interoperability and the congestion trends. Based on our
analysis, we argue that the network operators have taken negligible measures to
scale the mobile Internet. Affordable Internet is definitely for everyone. But,
the affordability of the Internet in terms of cost does not necessarily imply
the rightful access to Internet services.
  Chota recharge is possibly leading us to chota (shrunken) Internet!

conditions of core formation and Zn has been used to estimate the S contents of
the Earth's core and of the bulk Earth, assuming that they share similar
volatility and that Zn was not partitioned into the Earth's core. We have
conducted a suite of partitioning experiments to characterize Zn metal-silicate
elemental and isotopic fractionation as a function of time, temperature, and
composition. Experiments were conducted at temperatures from 1473-2273K, with
run durations from 5-240 minutes for four starting materials. Chemical and
isotopic equilibrium is achieved within 10 minutes. Zinc metal-silicate
isotopic fractionation displays no resolvable dependence on temperature,
composition, or oxygen fugacity. Thus, the Zn isotopic composition of silicate
phases can be used as a proxy for bulk telluric bodies. Results from this study
and literature data were used to parameterize Zn metal-silicate partitioning as
a function of temperature, pressure, and redox state. Using this
parameterization and viable formation conditions, we have estimated a range of
Zn contents in the cores of iron meteorite parent bodies (i.e. iron meteorites)
of ~0.1-150 ppm, in good agreement with natural observations. We have
calculated the first geochemical estimates for the Zn contents of the Earth's
core and of the bulk Earth, at 242 +/-107 ppm and 114 +/-34 ppm (respectively),
that consider the slightly siderophile behavior of Zn and are therefore
significantly higher than previous estimates. Assuming similar volatility for S
and Zn, a chondritic S/Zn ratio, and considering our new estimates, we have
calculated a geochemical upper bound for the S content of the Earth's core of
6.3 +/-1.9 wt%. This indicates that S may be a major contributor to the density
deficit of the Earth's core or that the S/Zn ratio for the Earth is
non-chondritic.

area is given, including fundamental contributions due to G. Bourdaud and L.

generalised hereby. Moreover, the conjecture from 1978 by C. Parenti and L.

is also analysed how such operators can change the support and the spectrum of
the functions they act on. Furthermore, the question of which temperate
distributions such operators have in their domains have been extensively
treated, and departing from H\""ormander's analysis of the operators fulfilling
the twisted diagonal condition or, more generally, belong to the self-adjoint
subclass, such operators are shown to be everywhere defined. Finally the
paradifferential splittings and the resulting boundedness in Lp Sobolev spaces,
and the more general Besov and Lizorkin--Triebel spaces, are amply discussed.

hemagglutinin sequences accumulated over the last decades, amino-acid
substitutions that are found in the 1918-1919 sequences but rare otherwise can
be identified with high confidence. Such an analysis reveals that Gly188, which

electric and magnetic fields due to a dipole source placed in layered media,
are derived in this paper. First, the electric and magnetic fields in the
spectral domain for the half space are expressed using Fresnel reflection and
transmission coefficients. Each component of electric field in the spectral
domain constitutes the spectral Green's function in layered media. The Green's
function in the spatial domain is then recovered involving Sommerfeld integrals
for each component in the spectral domain. By using Bessel identities, the
number of Sommerfeld integrals are reduced, resulting in much simpler and more
efficient formulas for numerical implementation compared with previous results.
This approach is extended to the three-layer Green's function. In addition, the
singular part of the Green's function is naturally separated out so that
integral equation methods developed for free space Green's functions can be
used with minimal modification. Numerical results are included to show
efficiency and accuracy of the derived formulas.

large number of plausible high-resolution images can explain the same
downsampled image. Most current single image SR methods use empirical risk
minimisation, often with a pixel-wise mean squared error (MSE) loss. However,
the outputs from such methods tend to be blurry, over-smoothed and generally
appear implausible. A more desirable approach would employ Maximum a Posteriori
(MAP) inference, preferring solutions that always have a high probability under
the image prior, and thus appear more plausible. Direct MAP estimation for SR
is non-trivial, as it requires us to build a model for the image prior from
samples. Furthermore, MAP inference is often performed via optimisation-based
iterative algorithms which don't compare well with the efficiency of
neural-network-based alternatives. Here we introduce new methods for amortised
MAP inference whereby we calculate the MAP estimate directly using a
convolutional neural network. We first introduce a novel neural network
architecture that performs a projection to the affine subspace of valid SR
solutions ensuring that the high resolution output of the network is always
consistent with the low resolution input. We show that, using this
architecture, the amortised MAP inference problem reduces to minimising the
cross-entropy between two distributions, similar to training generative models.
We propose three methods to solve this optimisation problem: (1) Generative
Adversarial Networks (GAN) (2) denoiser-guided SR which backpropagates
gradient-estimates from denoising to train the network, and (3) a baseline
method using a maximum-likelihood-trained image prior. Our experiments show
that the GAN based approach performs best on real image data. Lastly, we
establish a connection between GANs and amortised variational inference as in
e.g. variational autoencoders.

repairing storage nodes using intact nodes residing in other clusters is more
bandwidth-consuming than restoring nodes based on information from

intra-cluster repair bandwidth and cross-cluster repair bandwidth in modeling

of fundamental resources of distributed storage systems, namely, storage
capacity, intra-cluster repair bandwidth and cross-cluster repair bandwidth.
Based on the capacity expression, feasible sets of required resources which
enable reliable storage are analyzed. It is shown that the cross-cluster
traffic can be minimized to zero (i.e., intra-cluster local repair becomes
possible) by allowing extra resources on storage capacity and intra-cluster

of a graph~$G$ begin in one of two states, ""dormant"" or ""active"". Given a fixed
integer $r$, a dormant vertex becomes active if at any stage it has at least
$r$ active neighbors, and it remains active for the duration of the process.
Given an initial set of active vertices $A$, we say that $G$ $r$-percolates
(from $A$) if every vertex in $G$ becomes active after some number of steps.
Let $m(G,r)$ denote the minimum size of a set $A$ such that $G$ $r$-percolates

  Bootstrap percolation has been studied in a number of settings, and has
applications to both statistical physics and discrete epidemiology. Here, we
are concerned with degree-based density conditions that ensure $m(G,2)=2$. In
particular, we give an Ore-type degree sum result that states that if a graph
$G$ satisfies $\sigma_2(G)\ge n-2$, then either $m(G,2)=2$ or $G$ is in one of

CM period matrices generate certain unramified abelian class fields of quartic
CM fields, and they yield invariants of principally polarised abelian surfaces
with a known endomorphism ring. Smaller alternative class invariants, values of
modular functions for subgroups generating the same class fields, thus help to
speed up constructions in explicit class field theory and public-key
cryptography.
  Generalising results due to Schertz from elliptic curves to abelian surfaces
and from classical modular functions to Siegel modular functions, we show that
modular functions for the congruence subgroup $\Gamma^0 (N)$ yield class
invariants under some splitting conditions on~$N$. We show how to obtain all
Galois conjugates of a class invariant by evaluating the same modular function
in CM period matrices derived from an $N$-system. Such a system consists of
binary quadratic forms with coefficients in the real-quadratic subfield
satisfying certain congruence conditions modulo~$N$. We examine conditions
under which the minimal polynomial of a class invariant is real.
  Examples show that we may obtain class invariants that are much smaller than
in previous constructions.

had a nearly circular shape with a spatial extent of $\sim 3.5'$, the surface
brightness profile was not axisymmetric; a bright spot-like emission was found
at $\sim 1'$ away in the north-western direction from the center. The radial
profile of the surface brightness, except for this spot-like emission, was
reproduced with a single $\beta$-model; $\beta$ and the core radius were found

thermal plasma. The spectrum was well explained with an absorbed optically-thin

topological properties of the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) chain, with
alternating hopping amplitudes t1 and t2. Both numerically and analytically, we
show that the presence of interactions induces phase transitions between
topologically different regimes. In the particular case of one-hole excitations
in a half-filled SSH chain, the V=t2 vs. t1=t2 phase diagram has topological
phases at diagonal regions of the phase plane. The interaction acts in this
case as a passivation potential. For general filling of the SSH chain,
different eigensubspaces of the SSH Hamiltonian may be classified as
topologically trivial and non-trivial. The two-hole case is studied in detail
in the large interaction limit, and we show that a mapping can be constructed
of the two-hole SSH eigensubspaces into one-particle states of a
non-interacting one-dimensional (1D) tight-binding model, with interfaces
between regions with different hopping constants and local potentials. The
presence of topological edge states in the equivalent chain can be readily
identifed, as well as their correspondence to the original two-hole states.
Furthermore, we found that the presence of the NN interaction generates a state
where two holes occupy two consecutive edge states. Such many-body states
should also occur for arbitrary filling leading to the possibility of a
macroscopic hole gathering at the surface (at consecutive edge states).

theorem states that assuming a ""standard"" von Neumann measurement model and
""additivity"" of the total energy operator, projective measurements of a system
must conserve energy as defined by the system's energy operator. This paper
explores the ideas behind the WAY theorem in hopes of uncovering the origin of
the contradiction.
  After Araki and Yanase published their proof of the WAY theorem, Yanase
appended a new condition now known as the Yanase condition. Under the
simplifying assumption that the observable being measured has discrete and
non-degenerate eigenvalues, we prove that the Yanase condition actually follows
from the hypotheses of the original WAY theorem.
  The paper also proves that the hypotheses of the WAY theorem, together with
the simplifying assumption, imply that the energy operator for the measuring
apparatus must be a multiple of the identity, which seems physically unlikely.
It seems probable that this surprising conclusion, along with the Yanase
condition, also holds without the simplifying assumption.

permeability governing the Darcy flow. Using the material derivative with
respect to a convection velocity field we obtain the rate formulation which
allows for linearization of the residuum function. For a given time
discretization with backward finite difference approximation of the time
derivatives, two incremental problems are obtained which constitute the
predictor and corrector steps of the implicit time-integration scheme.
Conforming mixed finite element approximation in space is used. Validation of
the numerical model implemented in the SfePy code is reported for an isotropic
medium with a hyperelastic solid phase. The proposed linearization scheme is
motivated by the two-scale homogenization which will provide the local material
poroelastic coefficients involved in the incremental formulation.

items with one another. Agents may agree to a k-way exchange involving a cycle
of k agents. A barter exchange market can be represented by a digraph where the
vertices represent items and the edges out of a vertex indicate the items that
an agent is willing to accept in exchange for that item. It is known that the
problem of finding a set of vertex-disjoint cycles with the maximum total
number of vertices (MAX-SIZE-EXCHANGE) can be solved in polynomial time. We
consider a barter exchange where each agent may bring multiple items, and items
of the same agent are represented by vertices with the same color. A set of
cycles is said to be tropical if for every color there is a cycle that contains
a vertex of that color. We show that the problem of determining whether there
exists a tropical set of vertex-disjoint cycles in a digraph
(TROPICAL-EXCHANGE) is NP-complete and APX-hard. This is equivalent to
determining whether it is possible to arrange an exchange of items among agents
such that every agent trades away at least one item. TROPICAL-MAX-SIZE-EXCHANGE
is a similar problem, where the goal is to find a set of vertex-disjoint cycles
that contains the maximum number of vertices and also contains all of the
colors in the graph. We show that this problem is likewise NP-complete and
APX-hard. For the restricted case where there are at most two vertices of each
color (corresponding to a restriction that each agent may bring at most two
items), both problems remain NP-hard but are in APX. Finally, we consider
MAX-SIZE-TROPICAL-EXCHANGE, where the set of cycles must primarily include as
many colors as possible and secondarily include as many vertices as possible.

dissipation in the same range without the need of singularity. Its cause could
be in relation with the same type of behavior observed in a rotating frame.

formulated by Einstein, is a philosophical rather than a scientific theory.
What is scientific and experimentally supported is the formalism of the
relativistic mechanics embedded in the Lorentz transformations and their direct
mathematical, experimental and observational consequences. This is in parallel
with the quantum mechanics where the scientific content and experimental
support of this branch of physics is embedded in the formalism of quantum
mechanics and not in its philosophical interpretations such as the Copenhagen
school or the parallel worlds explanations. Einstein theory of special
relativity gets unduly credit from the success of the relativistic mechanics of
Lorentz transformations. Hence, all the postulates and consequences of Einstein
interpretation which have no direct experimental or observational support
should be reexamined and the relativistic mechanics of Lorentz transformations
should be treated in education, academia and research in a similar fashion to
that of quantum mechanics.

and the experimental Tully Fisher rule, linking the total galactic mass to the
fourth power of the velocity, through an acceleration coefficient of about
10-10 m/s2 has not found a deep theoretical explanation. Tentative proposals
(MOND theory of a modified Newton s law and extraneous dark matter) do not
bring a definite clarification. We propose here a new approach to this problem,
without exotic matter and using the classical Newton force. But we introduce a
new additional universal acceleration, which could represent a universal
expansion law valid at the scale level of a galaxy. We show that this
hypothesis leads to a good description of the observed variations of the
galactic transverse velocity. It can be considered as a consequence of the
Scale Expansion Cosmos theory (SEC) introduced by J. Masreliez, but we
postulate that the space expansion acceleration universally applies at any
scale. We obtain a formal derivation of the Tully Fisher law, linking the
constant galactic transverse velocity to its total mass, via the universal
minimum acceleration. We derive a good estimate of the TF acceleration
coefficient and show that expansion should be proportional to the square root
of the local volumic mass density. Our conjecture is in fact a new dynamics
principle which could be applied to many other physical problems at different
scales. Applying it to the range of the solar planet system confirms the well
known Kepler laws, at least as a valid approximation for the order of magnitude
of the solar system.

recent resurgence in stereo-3D movies and the recent emergence of VR-enabled

Here, we present the technical requirements for acquiring stereoscopic images
of Solar System objects, given the constraints of the telescopic equipment and
the orbits of the target objects, and we present a handful of examples.

Log- Determinant (Log-Det) divergences, between positive definite unitized
trace class operators on a Hilbert space. This is a generalization of the
Alpha-Beta Log-Determinant divergences between symmetric, positive definite
matrices to the infinite-dimensional setting. The family of Alpha-Beta Log-Det
divergences is highly general and contains many divergences as special cases,
including the recently formulated infinite dimensional affine-invariant
Riemannian distance and the infinite-dimensional Alpha Log-Det divergences
between positive definite unitized trace class operators. In particular, it
includes a parametrized family of metrics between positive definite trace class
operators, with the affine-invariant Riemannian distance and the square root of
the symmetric Stein divergence being special cases. For the Alpha-Beta Log-Det
divergences between covariance operators on a Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space
(RKHS), we obtain closed form formulas via the corresponding Gram matrices.

any ponderable object (for example a clock) are time-like. In consequence, in
the analysis of any space-time experiment involving clocks only the region for
$c\Delta t \ge 0$ between the line $\Delta x = 0$ and the light cone projection
$c\Delta t = \Delta x$ of the $c\Delta t$ versus $\Delta x$ Minkowski plot is
physically relevant. This breaks the manifest space-time symmetry of the plot.
A further consequence is the unphysical nature of the `relativity of
simultaneity' and `length contraction' effects of conventional special
relativity theory. The only modification of space-time transformation laws in
passing from Galilean to special relativity is then the replacement of
universal Newtonian time by a universal (position independent) time dilation
effect for moving clocks.
