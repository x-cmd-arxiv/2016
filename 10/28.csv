estimating the local modes of the distribution of $Y$ given $X=x$ when $X$ is
prone to measurement error. We propose two nonparametric estimation methods,
with one based on estimating the joint density of $(X, Y)$ in the presence of
measurement error, and the other built upon estimating the conditional density
of $Y$ given $X=x$ using error-prone data. We study the asymptotic properties
of each proposed mode estimator, and provide implementation details including
the mean-shift algorithm for mode seeking and bandwidth selection. Numerical
studies are presented to compare the proposed methods with an existing mode
estimation method developed for error-free data naively applied to error-prone
data.

and Gaussian processes. A well-known construction of such functions comes from
Bochner's characterization, which connects a positive-definite function with a
probability distribution. Another construction, which appears to have attracted
less attention, is Polya's criterion that characterizes a subset of these
functions. In this paper, we study the latter characterization and derive a
number of novel kernels little known previously.
  In the context of large-scale kernel machines, Rahimi and Recht (2007)
proposed a random feature map (random Fourier) that approximates a kernel
function, through independent sampling of the probability distribution in
Bochner's characterization. The authors also suggested another feature map
(random binning), which, although not explicitly stated, comes from Polya's
characterization. We show that with the same number of random samples, the
random binning map results in an Euclidean inner product closer to the kernel
than does the random Fourier map. The superiority of the random binning map is
confirmed empirically through regressions and classifications in the
reproducing kernel Hilbert space.

robust constraints on stellar ages are currently available for only a limited

will be able to provide evidence for quenching periods during the star
formation history of the Milky Way. Using a population synthesis code, we
produced populations based on various stellar formation history models and
limited the analysis to red-giant-branch stars. We investigated the
mass-Galactic-disk-height distributions, where stellar mass was used as an age
proxy, to test for whether periods of quenching can be observed by TESS. We
found that even with the addition of 15% noise to the inferred masses, it will
be possible for TESS to find evidence for/against quenching periods suggested
in the literature (e.g. between 7 and 9 Gyr ago), therefore providing stringent
constraints on the formation and evolution of the Milky Way.

these models. We construct the Floquet charts to find regions of parameter
space in which particle production is efficient for both the adiabatic and
isocurvature modes, and analyze the resonance structure using analytic and
semi-analytic techniques. Particle production in the adiabatic direction is
characterized by the existence of an asymptotic scaling solution at large
values of the nonminimal couplings, $\xi_I \gg 1$, in which the dominant
instability band arises in the long-wavelength limit, for comoving wavenumbers
$k \rightarrow 0$. However, the large-$\xi_I$ regime is not reached until
$\xi_I \geq {\cal O} (100)$. In the intermediate regime, with $\xi_I \sim {\cal
O}(1 - 10)$, the resonance structure depends strongly on wavenumber and
couplings. The resonance structure for isocurvature perturbations is distinct
and more complicated than its adiabatic counterpart. An intermediate regime,
for $\xi_I \sim {\cal O} (1 - 10)$, is again evident. For large values of
$\xi_I$, the Floquet chart consists of densely spaced, nearly parallel
instability bands, suggesting a very efficient preheating behavior. The
increased efficiency arises from features of the nontrivial field-space
manifold in the Einstein frame, which itself arises from the fields' nonminimal
couplings in the Jordan frame, and has no analogue in models with minimal
couplings. Quantitatively, the approach to the large-$\xi_I$ asymptotic
solution for isocurvature modes is slower than in the case of the adiabatic

with VT, a theory which accounts for a kind of dark energy which has the same
equation of state as vacuum. New versions of the codes CAMB and COSMOMC have
been designed for applications to VT, and the resulting versions have been used
to get the cosmological parameters of the VT model at suitable confidence
levels. The parameters to be estimated are the same as ingeneral relativity
(GR), plus a new parameter $D$. For $D=0$, VT linear cosmological perturbations
reduces to those of GR, but the VT background may explain dark energy. The fits
between observations and VT predictions lead to non vanishing $|D|$ upper
limits at the $1\sigma $ confidence level. The value $D=0$ is admissible at
this level, but this value is not that of the best fit in any case. Results
strongly suggest that VT may explain current observations, at least, as well as

fracture. Our focus is on brittle fracture and we propose a finite strain
hyperelastic thermodynamic framework for the coupled mass-flow-elastic boundary
value problem. The attractiveness of the proposed framework as compared to the
traditional continuum damage theories is that no internal parameters (like
damage variables, phase fields etc.) are used while the regularization of the
failure localization is provided by the physically sound law of mass balance.

  Applications",,,,,"cs.NA","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In this paper, we revisit the generalized block power methods for
approximating the eigenvector associated with $\lambda_1 = 1$ of a Markov chain
transition matrix. Our analysis of the block power method shows that when $s$
linearly independent probability vectors are used as the initial block, the
convergence of the block power method to the stationary distribution depends on
the magnitude of the $(s+1)$th dominant eigenvalue $\lambda_{s+1}$ of $P$
instead of that of $\lambda_2$ in the power method. Therefore, the block power
method with block size $s$ is particularly effective for transition matrices
where $|\lambda_{s+1}|$ is well separated from $\lambda_1 = 1$ but
$|\lambda_2|$ is not. This approach is particularly useful when visiting the
elements of a large transition matrix is the main computational bottleneck over
matrix--vector multiplications, where the block power method can effectively
reduce the total number of times to pass over the matrix. To further reduce the
overall computational cost, we combine the block power method with a sliding
window scheme, taking advantage of the subsequent vectors of the latest $s$
iterations to assemble the block matrix. The sliding window scheme correlates
vectors in the sliding window to quickly remove the influences from the
eigenvalues whose magnitudes are smaller than $|\lambda_{s}|$ to reduce the
overall number of matrix--vector multiplications to reach convergence. Finally,
we compare the effectiveness of these methods in a Markov chain model
representing a stochastic luminal calcium release site.

framework reduces to the weak-field and slow-motion post-Newtonian treatment of
gravity in the appropriate limits, but also includes the low-amplitude
large-scale fluctuations that are important for cosmological modelling. We
derive a set of field equations that can be applied to the late Universe, where
non-linear structure exists on supercluster scales, and perform a detailed
investigation of the associated gauge problem. This allows us to identify a
consistent set of perturbed quantities in both the gravitational and matter
sectors, and to construct a set of gauge-invariant quantities that correspond
to each of them. The field equations, written in terms of these quantities,
take on a relatively simple form, and allow the effects of small-scale
structure on the large-scale properties of the Universe to be clearly
identified. We find that inhomogeneous structures source the global expansion,
that there exist new field equations at new orders, and that there is vector
gravitational potential that is a hundred times larger than one might naively
expect from cosmological perturbation theory. Finally, we expect our formalism
to be of use for calculating relativistic effects in upcoming ultra-large-scale
surveys, as the form of the gravitational coupling between small and large
scales depends on the non-linearity of Einstein's equations, and occurs at what
is normally thought of as first order in cosmological perturbations.

we aim to identify an actuator which requires the least amount of control

Recall that the least amount of control energy needed to drive a linear

is upper-bounded by the inverse of the smallest eigenvalue of the associated
controllability Gramian, and moreover, the upper-bound is sharp. The minimax

by employing Green's function technique within the BCS-mean-field
approximation. It is observed that the isotope effect coefficient increases
with the increase of the hybridization while with the increase in Coulomb
interaction it starts decreasing. On increasing the carrier density per site in
two orbital per site iron pnictide system, isotope effect coefficient
($\alpha$) exhibits large values (much higher than BCS limit) at lower
temperatures. While in the underdoped case, isotope effect coefficient shows
minimum value in superconducting states of the iron based systems. Furthermore,
it has been found that the large value of the isotope effect coefficient is the
indication of the fact that the contribution of phonon alone is inadequate as
the origin of superconductivity in these systems. Finally, the obtained
theoretical results have been compared with experimental and existing

review here our past works on magnetization transport in insulating magnets and
also add new insights, with a particular focus on magnon transport. We
summarize in detail the magnon counterparts of electron transport, such as the
Wiedemann-Franz law, the Onsager reciprocal relation between the Seebeck and

Josephson effects, and the persistent quantized current in a ring to list a

dipoles, we theoretically propose a way to directly measure magnon currents. As
a consequence of the Mermin-Wagner-Hohenberg theorem, spin transport is
drastically altered in one-dimensional antiferromagnetic (AF) spin-1/2 chains;
where the N\'eel order is destroyed by quantum fluctuations and a quasiparticle
magnon-like picture breaks down. Instead, the low-energy collective excitations
of the AF spin chain are described by a Tomonaga-Luttinger liquid (TLL) which
provides the spin transport properties in such antiferromagnets some universal
features at low enough temperature. Finally, we enumerate open issues and
provide a platform to discuss the future directions of magnonics.

Higgs for their work in 1964 along with the late Robert Brout on the mass
generation mechanism (the Higgs mechanism) in local gauge theories. This
mechanism requires the existence of a massive scalar particle, the Higgs boson,
and in 2012 the Higgs boson was finally discovered at the Large Hadron Collider
after being sought for almost half a century. In this article we review the
work that led to the discovery of the Higgs boson and discuss its implications.
We approach the topic from the perspective of a dynamically generated Higgs
boson that is a fermion-antifermion bound state rather than an elementary field
that appears in an input Lagrangian. In particular, we emphasize the connection
with the Barden-Cooper-Schrieffer theory of superconductivity. We identify the
double-well Higgs potential not as a fundamental potential but as a mean-field
effective Lagrangian with a dynamical Higgs boson being generated through a
residual interaction that accompanies the mean-field Lagrangian. We discuss
what we believe to be the key challenge raised by the discovery of the Higgs
boson, namely determining whether it is elementary or composite, and through
study of a conformal invariant field theory model as realized with critical
scaling and anomalous dimensions, suggest that the width of the Higgs boson
might serve as a suitable diagnostic for discriminating between an elementary
Higgs boson and a composite one. We show that the contribution to the
cosmological constant due to a composite Higgs boson is more tractable and
under control than the contribution due to an elementary Higgs boson, and is
potentially completely under control if there is an underlying conformal
symmetry not just in a critical scaling matter sector, but equally in the
gravity sector to which the matter sector couples.

dimensionless momentum variable $z$ (radial over angular momentum). This
regularises the limit of massless particles, and in that limit allows us to
obtain a reduced system in independent variables $(t,r,z)$ only. Similarly, in
this limit the Vlasov density function $f$ for static solutions depends on a
single variable $Q$ (energy over angular momentum). This reduction allows us to
show that any given static metric which has vanishing Ricci scalar, is vacuum
at the centre and for $r>3M$ and obeys certain energy conditions uniquely
determines a consistent $f=\bar k(Q)$ (in closed form). Vice versa, any $\bar
k(Q)$ within a certain class uniquely determines a static metric (as the
solution of a system of two first-order quasilinear ODEs). Hence the space of
static spherically symmetric solutions of Einstein-Vlasov is locally a space of
functions of one variable. For a simple 2-parameter family of functions $\bar
k(Q)$, we construct the corresponding static spherically symmetric solutions,
finding that their compactness is in the interval $0.7\lesssim \rm
max_r(2M/r)\le 8/9$. This class of static solutions includes one that agrees
with the approximately universal type-I critical solution recently found by
Akbarian and Choptuik (AC) in numerical time evolutions. We speculate on what
singles it out as the critical solution found by fine-tuning generic data to
the collapse threshold, given that AC also found that {\em all} static
solutions are one-parameter unstable and sit on the threshold of collapse.

universe during preheating, as well as the effect of the coupled metric
perturbations on particle production. The adiabatic and isocurvature
perturbations are governed by different effective masses that scale differently
with the nonminimal couplings and evolve differently in time. The effective
mass for the adiabatic modes is dominated by contributions from the coupled
metric perturbations immediately after inflation. The metric perturbations
contribute an oscillating tachyonic term that enhances an early period of
significant particle production for the adiabatic modes, which ceases on a
time-scale governed by the nonminimal couplings $\xi_I$. The effective mass of
the isocurvature perturbations, on the other hand, is dominated by
contributions from the fields' potential and from the curvature of the
field-space manifold (in the Einstein frame), the balance between which shifts
on a time-scale governed by $\xi_I$. As in papers I and II, we identify
distinct behavior depending on whether the nonminimal couplings are small

columns intersect in a few positions. Such matrices come up naturally when
studying problems involving point sets with many collinear triples. In this
work we consider design matrices with block (or matrix) entries. Our main
result is a lower bound on the rank of such matrices, extending the bounds
proved in {BDWY12,DSW12} for the scalar case. As a result we obtain several
applications in combinatorial geometry. The first application involves
extending the notion of structural rigidity (or graph rigidity) to the setting
where we wish to bound the number of `degrees of freedom' in perturbing a set
of points under collinearity constraints (keeping some family of triples
collinear). Other applications are an asymptotically tight Sylvester-Gallai

incidence bound for high dimensional line/curve arrangements.
  The main technical tool in the proof of the rank bound is an extension of the
technique of matrix scaling to the setting of block matrices. We generalize the
definition of doubly stochastic matrices to matrices with block entries and
derive sufficient conditions for a doubly stochastic scaling to exist.

Molecular Clouds peaks at 2 GeV are the energy losses and magnetic cutoffs
inside MCs, thus depleting the low energy part of the CR spectra and shifting
the maximum of the gamma-ray spectra to higher energies. This peaking of the
emissivity in Molecular Clouds at 2 GeV was clearly observed from the spectrum
of the Central Molecular Zone, which dominates the emission in the inner few
degrees of the Galactic Centre.
  Although the spectrum of the Central Molecular Zone peaks at 2 GeV, it cannot
be responsible for the ""GeV-excess"" observed in the halo, since the latitude
extension of the Zone is below $\rm |b|<0.5^\circ$. However, lines-of-sight
into the halo cross Molecular Clouds in the disk, so the emissivity of clouds

that this ""GeV-excess"" has the same morphology in the disk {\it and} in the

parametrized by the longitudinal spin density and a magnetic analog of the
fluid velocity that define spin-density waves. A direct consequence of these
equations is the determination of a magnetic Mach number. Micromagnetic
simulations reveal nucleation of nonlinear structures from an impenetrable
object realized by an applied magnetic field spot or a defect. In this work,
micromagnetic simulations demonstrate vortex-antivortex pair nucleation from an

polarization (spin $s_z=-1,0,+1$) modes of the rho meson, as well as the
corresponding pole mass and width, are decomposed in a nontrivial manner
compared to the vacuum case. To see the significance of the reduction effect,
we simply take the lowest-Landau level approximation to analyze the
spin-dependent rho masses and widths. We find that the ""fate"" of the rho meson
may be more complicated because of the magnetic-dimensional reduction: as the
magnetic field increases, the rho width for the spin $s_z=0$ starts to develop,
reach a peak, to be vanishing at the critical magnetic field to which the
folklore refers. On the other side, the decay rates of the other rhos for
$s_z=-1,+1$ monotonically increase as the magnetic field develops. The
correlation between the polarization dependence and the Landau-level truncation
is also addressed.

theory is formulated in the grand canonical ensemble. This projection is
usually carried out in a saddle-point approximation. Here we derive formulas
for an exact particle-number projection of the finite-temperature mean-field

weak and the Hartree-Fock (HF) approximation is the appropriate mean-field
theory, and nuclei with strong pairing condensates, in which the appropriate
theory is the Hartree-Fock-Bogoliubov (HFB) approximation, a method that
explicitly violates particle-number conservation. For the HFB approximation, we
present a general projection formula for a condensate that is time-reversal
invariant and a simpler formula for the Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS) limit,
which is realized in nuclei with spherical condensates. We apply the method to
three heavy nuclei: a typical deformed nucleus $^{162}$Dy, a typical spherical
nucleus $^{148}$Sm, and a transitional nucleus $^{150}$Sm in which the pairing
condensate is deformed. We compare the results of this projection with results
from the saddle-point approximation and exact shell model Monte Carlo
calculations. We find that the approximate canonical HF entropy in the
particle-number projection decreases monotonically to zero in the limit when
the temperature goes to zero. However, in a nucleus with a strong pairing
condensate, the approximate canonical HFB entropy in the particle-number
projection decreases monotonically to a negative value, reflecting the
violation of particle-number conservation. Computationally, the exact
particle-number projection is more efficient than calculating the derivatives
required in the saddle-point approximation.

principle, confirm that observed zero-bias anomalies are indeed indicative of
the presence of anyonic Majorana zero modes. Moreover, such a demonstration
would be a breakthrough at the level of fundamental physics: the first clear
demonstration of a non-Abelian excitation. It is therefore important to clarify
the expected signals of Majorana physics in the braiding context, and to
differentiate these signals from those that might also arise in non-topological

point out situations where `trivial' and `anyonic' signatures may be similar

better at distinguishing between topological and non-topological systems than

driving the outflows, but there is no consensus as to how much energy, mass and

Assuming SN rate scales with gas surface density $\Sigma_{\rm{gas}}$ as in the

decreases with increasing $\Sigma_{\rm{gas}}$ as $\eta_m \propto

hot phase ($T>3\times 10^5$ K), which fills 60-80\% of the volume at mid-plane,
carries the majority of the energy and metals in outflows. We discuss how
various physical processes, including vertical distribution of SNe,
photoelectric heating, external gravitational field and SN rate, affect the
loading efficiencies. The relative scale height of gas and SNe is a very
important factor in determining the loading efficiencies.

discoveries in modern cosmology, pointing to a universe in which 70% of the

This result has been well established using a combination of cosmological
probes (e.g., Planck Collaboration et al. 2016), resulting in a ""standard
model"" of modern cosmology that is a combination of a cosmological constant
with cold dark matter and baryons. The first compelling evidence for the
acceleration came in the late 1990's, when two independent teams studying type
Ia supernovae discovered that distant SNe Ia were dimmer than expected. The
combined analysis of modern cosmology experiments, including SNe Ia, the Hubble
constant, baryon acoustic oscillations, and the cosmic microwave background has
now measured the contributions of matter and the cosmological constant to the
energy density of the universe to better than 0.01, providing a secure
measurement of acceleration. A recent study (Tr{\o}st Nielsen et al. 2015) has
claimed that the evidence for acceleration from SNe Ia is ""marginal."" Here we
demonstrate errors in that analysis which reduce the acceleration significance
from SNe Ia, and further demonstrate that conservative constraints on the
curvature or matter density of the universe increase the significance even
more. Analyzing the Joint Light-curve Analysis supernova sample, we find
4.2{\sigma} evidence for acceleration with SNe Ia alone, and 11.2{\sigma} in a
flat universe. With our improved supernova analysis and by not rejecting all
other cosmological constraints, we find that acceleration is quite secure.

Weyl semimetal(WSM)-insulator quantum critical point (QCP). But, a metallic
phase sets in through a quantum phase transition (QPT) at strong disorder
across a multicritical point (MCP). The field theoretic predictions for the
correlation length exponent $\nu=2$ and dynamic scaling exponent $z=5/4$ at
this MCP are in good agreement with the ones extracted numerically, yielding
$\nu=1.98 \pm 0.10$ and $z=1.26 \pm 0.05$, from the scaling of the average
density of states (DOS). Deep inside the WSM phase, generic disorder is also an
irrelevant perturbation, while a metallic phase appears at strong disorder
through a QPT. We here demonstrate that in the presence of generic, but strong
disorder the WSM-metal QPT is ultimately always characterized by the exponents
$\nu=1$ and $z=3/2$ (to one-loop order), originating from intra-node or chiral
symmetric (e.g., regular and axial potential) disorder. We here anchor such
emergent \emph{chiral superuniversality} through complementary RG calculations,
controlled via $\epsilon$-expansions, and numerical analysis of average DOS
across WSM-metal QPT. In addition, we also discuss a subsequent QPT (at even
stronger disorder) of a Weyl metal into an Anderson insulator by numerically
computing the typical DOS at zero energy. The scaling behavior of various
physical observables, such as residue of quasiparticle pole, dynamic
conductivity, specific heat, Gr$\ddot{\mbox{u}}$neisen ratio, inside various

the blue and these `blueshifts' almost certainly signal the presence of strong
outflows. As a consequence, single-epoch virial black hole (BH) mass estimates
derived from CIV velocity-widths are known to be systematically biased compared
to masses from the hydrogen Balmer lines. Using a large sample of 230
high-luminosity (log $L_{\rm Bol}$ = 45.5-48 erg/s), redshift 1.5<z<4.0 quasars
with both CIV and Balmer line spectra, we have quantified the bias in CIV BH
masses as a function of the CIV blueshift. CIV BH masses are shown to be a
factor of five larger than the corresponding Balmer-line masses at CIV
blueshifts of 3000 km/s and are over-estimated by almost an order of magnitude
at the most extreme blueshifts, >5000 km/s. Using the monotonically increasing
relationship between the CIV blueshift and the mass ratio BH(CIV)/BH(H$\alpha$)
we derive an empirical correction to all CIV BH-masses. The scatter between the
corrected CIV masses and the Balmer masses is 0.24 dex at low CIV blueshifts
(~0 km/s) and just 0.10 dex at high blueshifts (~3000 km/s), compared to 0.40
dex before the correction. The correction depends only on the CIV line
properties - i.e. full-width at half maximum and blueshift - and can therefore
be applied to all quasars where CIV emission line properties have been
measured, enabling the derivation of un-biased virial BH mass estimates for the

can be produced in stars, it can grow in the interstellar medium and be
destroyed by astration and interstellar shocks. In this paper, we assemble a
few data samples of local and distant star-forming galaxies to analyse various
dust-related quantities in low and high redshift galaxies, to study how the
relations linking the dust mass to the stellar mass and star formation rate
evolve with redshift. We interpret the available data by means of chemical
evolution models for discs and proto-spheroid (PSPH) starburst galaxies. In
particular, we focus on the dust-to-stellar mass (DTS) ratio, as this quantity
represents a true measure of how much dust per unit stellar mass survives the
various destruction processes in galaxies and is observable. The theoretical
models outline the strong dependence of this quantity on the underlying star
formation history. Spiral galaxies are characterised by a nearly constant DTS
as a function of the stellar mass and cosmic time, whereas PSPHs present an
early steep increase of the DTS, which stops at a maximal value and decreases
in the latest stages. In their late starburst phase, these models show a
decrease of the DTS with their mass, which allows us to explain the observed
anti-correlation between the DTS and the stellar mass. The observed redshift
evolution of the DTS ratio shows an increase from z~0 to z~1, followed by a
roughly constant behaviour at 1<z<2.5. Our models indicate a steep decrease of
the global DTS at early times, which implies an expected decrease of the DTS at
larger redshift.

comparing with the abundance of UDGs in rich galaxy clusters, we find that the
density of UDGs (i.e. their number per unit mass of the host structure where
they are located) decreases towards the most massive systems. This is
compatible with a scenario where UDGs are formed preferentially outside
clusters. In the periphery (D>250 kpc) of our three groups, we identify a
population of potential UDG progenitors (two of them confirmed
spectroscopically). These progenitors have similar masses, shapes and sizes but
are bluer, g-i~0.45, (and for this reason brighter, mu_g(0)<24 mag arcsec -2)
than traditional UDGs (g-i~0.76). A passive evolution of these progenitors will
transform them into regular (i.e. mu_g(0)>24 mag arcsec -2) UDGs after ~6 Gyr.
If confirmed, our observations support a scenario where UDGs are old, extended,

not correlate with any global or local galaxy property (baryonic mass, gas

Natural Law: when the baryonic contribution is measured, the rotation curve
follows, and vice versa. Including ultrafaint dSphs, the relation may extend by
another 2 dex and possibly flatten at gbar<10^-12 m/s^2, but these data are

times papers with male first authors receive more citations than papers with
female first authors. This difference has been decreasing with time and amounts
to $\sim$6% measured over the last 30 years. To account for the fact that the
properties of female and male first author papers differ intrinsically, we use
a random forest algorithm to control for the non-gender specific properties of
these papers which include seniority of the first author, number of references,
total number of authors, year of publication, publication journal, field of
study and region of the first author's institution. We show that papers
authored by females receive 10.4$\pm$0.9% fewer citations than what would be
expected if the papers with the same non-gender specific properties were
written by the male authors. Finally, we also find that female authors in our
sample tend to self-cite more, but that this effect disappears when controlled
for non-gender specific variables.

super colliders are frequent predictions in TeV-scale extensions of the
Standard Model of Particle Physics. In such scenarios, accurate modeling of QCD
radiation is necessary for trustworthy predictions. We present the automation
of fully differential, next-to-leading-order (NLO) in QCD corrections with
parton shower (PS) matching for an effective Left-Right Symmetric Model (LRSM)
that features $W_R^\pm, Z_R$ gauge bosons and heavy Majorana neutrinos $N$.
Publicly available universal model files require remarkably fewer user inputs
for predicting benchmark collider processes than leading order LRSM
constructions. We present predictions for inclusive $W_R^\pm, Z_R$ production
at the $\sqrt{s} = 13$ TeV Large Hadron Collider (LHC) and a hypothetical
future 100 TeV Very Large Hadron Collider (VLHC), as well as inclusive $N$
production for a hypothetical Large Hadron Electron Collider (LHeC). As a case
study, we investigate at NLO+PS accuracy the properties of heavy neutrino
(color-singlet) jets and top quark (color-triplet) jets from decays of
high-mass $W_R$ bosons at the LHC. Contrary to top jets, we find that the
kinematic properties of heavy neutrinos jets, and in particular jet mass, are
resilient against the effects of parton showers and hard QCD radiation. This
suggests that in searches for neutrino jets, aggressive selection cuts that
would otherwise be inappropriate for top jets can be imposed with minimal
signal loss.

in Weyl semimetals with an asymmetry in the dispersion relations of the left-
and right-handed chiral Weyl fermions. In such materials, time-dependent
pumping of electrons from a non-chiral external source generates a
non-vanishing chiral chemical potential. This is due to the different
capacities of the left- and right-handed (LH and RH) chiral Weyl cones arising
from the difference in the density of states in the LH and RH cones. The chiral
chemical potential then generates, via the chiral anomaly, a current along the
direction of an applied magnetic field even in the absence of an external
electric field. The source of chirality imbalance in this new setup is thus due
to the band structure of the system and the presence of (non-chiral) electron
source, and not due to the parallel electric and magnetic fields. We illustrate
the effect by an argument based on the effective field theory, and by the
chiral kinetic theory calculation for a rotationally invariant Weyl semimetal
with different Fermi velocities in the left and right chiral Weyl cones; we
also consider the case of a Weyl semimetal with Weyl nodes at different
energies. We argue that this effect is generically present in Weyl semimetals
with different dispersion relations for LH and RH chiral Weyl cones, such as
SrSi2 recently predicted as a Weyl semimetal with broken inversion and mirror
symmetries, as long as the chiral relaxation time is much longer than the
transport scattering time.

fascinating field. It opened a new field of research ""straintronics"" linked to

observation of pseudo landau levels with scanning tunnel microscopy presents
nevertheless some ambiguities. Similar strain patterns show different images
sometimes difficult to interpret. In this work we strain the analogy of the
pseudo versus real electromagnetic fields, as well as the fact that graphene
has a relativistic behavior and show that, for some strain configurations, the
deformation potential acts like a parallel electric field able to destabilize
the Landau level structure via a mechanism identical to that described in
\cite{LSB07,PC07} for real electromagnetic fields. The underlying physics is
the combination of Maxwell electrodynamics and special relativity implying that
different reference frames observe different electromagnetic fields

external origin, which opens the door to an electric control of the giant
pseudomagnetic fields in graphene.

collisions. Inelastic $p\bar{p}$-scattering events are selected online using
minimally-biasing requirements followed by an optimized offline selection. The
$K^-\pi^+\pi^+$ mass distribution is used to identify the $D^+$ signal, and the
$D^+$ transverse impact-parameter distribution is used to separate prompt
production, occurring directly in the hard scattering process, from secondary
production from $b$-hadron decays. We obtain a prompt $D^+$ signal of 2950
candidates corresponding to a total cross section $\sigma(D^+, 1.5 < p_T <

theoretical estimates in each $p_T$ bin, the shape of the observed $p_T$
spectrum is softer than the expectation from quantum chromodynamics. The
results are unique in $p\bar{p}$ collisions and can improve the shape and
uncertainties of future predictions.

these asymmetries (spreading hotspots, surface waves, and cooling wakes) depend
on the accretion rate. By analysis of archival RXTE data of six oscillation
sources, we investigate the accretion rate dependence of the amplitude of burst
oscillations. This more than doubles the size of the sample analysed previously
by Muno et al. (2004), who found indications for a relationship between
accretion rate and oscillation amplitudes. We find that burst oscillation
signals can be detected at all observed accretion rates. Moreover, oscillations
at low accretion rates are found to have relatively small amplitudes
($A_\text{rms}\leq0.10$) while oscillations detected in bursts observed at high
accretion rates cover a broad spread in amplitudes ($0.05\leq
A_\text{rms}\leq0.20$). In this paper we present the results of our analysis
and discuss these in the light of current burst oscillation models.
Additionally, we investigate the bursts of two sources without previously
detected oscillations. Despite that these sources have been observed at
accretion rates where burst oscillations might be expected, we find their
behaviour to be not anomalous compared to oscillation sources.

corollaries follow, including (1) if $X$ is a locally compact Hausdorff space
then $|X|\leq 2^{wL(X)\psi(X)}$, and (2) if $X$ is a locally compact power
homogeneous Hausdorff space then $|X|\leq 2^{wL(X)t(X)}$. The first extends the
well-known cardinality bound $2^{\psi(X)}$ for a compactum $X$ in a new
direction. As $|X|\leq 2^{wL(X)\chi(X)}$ for a normal space $X$ [3], this
enlarges the class of known Tychonoff spaces for which this bound holds. In
2.10 we give a short, direct proof of (1) that does not use 2.1. Yet 2.1 is
broad enough to establish results much more general than (1), such as if $X$ is
a regular space with a $\pi$-base $\scr{B}$ such that $|B|\leq
2^{wL(X)\chi(X)}$ for all $B\in\scr{B}$, then $|X|\leq 2^{wL(X)\chi(X)}$.
  Separately, it is shown that if $X$ is a regular space with a $\pi$-base
whose elements have compact closure, then $|X|\leq 2^{wL(X)\psi(X)t(X)}$. This
partially answers a question from [3] and gives a third, separate proof of (1).
We also show that if $X$ is a weakly Lindel\""of, normal, sequential space with
$\chi(X)\leq 2^{\aleph_0}$, then $|X|\leq 2^{\aleph_0}$.
  Result (2) above is a new generalization of the cardinality bound $2^{t(X)}$
for a power homogeneous compactum $X$ (Arhangel'skii, van Mill, and Ridderbos

2 active galactic nucleus (AGN) IC 3639, in conjunction with archival Suzaku
and Chandra data. This provides the first broadband X-ray spectral analysis of
the source, spanning nearly two decades in energy (0.5-30 keV). Previous X-ray
observations of the source below 10 keV indicated strong reflection/obscuration
on the basis of a pronounced iron fluorescence line at 6.4 keV. The hard X-ray
energy coverage of NuSTAR, together with self-consistent toroidal reprocessing
models, enables direct broadband constraints on the obscuring column density of
the source. We find the source to be heavily Compton-thick (CTK) with an
obscuring column in excess of $3.6\times10^{24}$ cm$^{-2}$, unconstrained at
the upper end. We further find an intrinsic 2-10 keV luminosity of
$\textrm{log}_{10}(L_{\textrm{2-10 keV}} \textrm{[erg s}^{-1}]) =
43.4^{+0.6}_{-1.1}$ to 90% confidence, almost 400 times the observed flux, and
consistent with various multi-wavelength diagnostics. Such a high intrinsic to
observed flux ratio in addition to an Fe-K$\alpha$ fluorescence line equivalent
width exceeding 2 keV is extreme amongst known bona fide CTK AGN, which we
suggest are both due to the high level of obscuration present around IC 3639.
Our study demonstrates that broadband spectroscopic modelling with NuSTAR
enables large corrections for obscuration to be carried out robustly, and
emphasises the need for improved modelling of AGN tori showing intense iron
fluorescence.

chromospheres. Starting with the historical Mount Wilson monitoring program,
CaH&K lines have been widely used to trace stellar magnetic activity, and as a
proxy for rotation period and consequently for stellar age. Monitoring stellar
activity has also become essential in filtering out false-positives due to
magnetic activity in extra-solar planet surveys. The Ca H&Kemission is
traditionally quantified through the R'HK-index, which compares the
chromospheric flux in the doublet to the overall bolometric flux of the star.
Much work has been done to characterize this index for FGK-dwarfs, but M-dwarfs
were left out of these analyses and no calibration of their Ca ii H&K emission
to an R'HK exists to date. We set out to characterize the magnetic activity of
the low and very low-mass stars by providing a calibration of the R'HK-index
that extends to the realm of M-dwarfs, and by evaluating the relation between
R'HK and the rotation period. We calibrated the bolometric and photospheric
factors for M-dwarfs to properly transform the S-index into the R'HK. We
monitored magnetic activity through the Ca ii H&K emission lines in the HARPS
M-dwarf sample. The R'HK index, like the fractional X-ray luminosity L_X/Lbol,
shows a saturated correlation with rotation, with saturation setting in around
a ten days rotation period. Above that period, slower rotators show weaker Ca
ii activity, as expected. Under that period, the R'HK index saturates to
~10^-4. Stellar mass modulates the Ca ii activity, with R'HK showing a constant
basal activity above 0.6Msun and then decreasing with mass between 0.6Msun and
the fully-convective limit of 0.35Msun. Short-term variability of the activity
correlates with its mean level, stars with higher R'HK index show larger R'HK
variability, as previously observed for earlier spectral types.

connectivity and session continuity between a mobile node and the network
during its movement. Current mobility management solutions generally require a
central entity in the network core, tracking IP address movement and anchoring
traffic from source to destination through point-to-point tunnels. Intuitively,
this approach suffers from scalability limitations as it creates bottlenecks in
the network, due to sub-optimal routing via the anchor point. Meanwhile,
alternative anchorless, solutions are not feasible due to the current
limitations of the IP semantics, which strongly ties addressing information to
location. In contrast, novel path-based forwarding solutions may be exploited
for feasible anchorless solutions. In this paper, we propose a novel
network-based mobility management solution that facilitates IP mobility over
such a path-based forwarding substrate. Our solution exploits the advantages of
such substrates in decoupling path calculation from data transfer to eliminate
the need for anchoring traffic through the network core; thereby, allowing
flexible path calculation and service provisioning. Furthermore, by eliminating
the limitation of routing via the anchor point, our approach reduces the
network cost compared to anchored solution through bandwidth saving while
maintaining comparable handover delay. We evaluate our solution through
analytical and simulation models and compare it with the IETF standardized
solution, Proxy Mobile IPv6 (PMIPv6). Evaluation results illustrate a
significant saving in the total network cost when using our proposed solution,

activities such as evolving models to add new features and reconciling
conflicting design models developed in parallel by different development teams.
As model composition is usually an error-prone and effort-consuming task, its
potential benefits, such as gains in productivity can be compromised. However,
there is no empirical knowledge nowadays about the effort required to compose
design models. Only feedbacks of model composition evangelists are available,
and they often diverge. Consequently, developers are unable to conduct any
cost-effectiveness analysis as well as identify, predict, or reduce composition
effort. The inability of evaluating composition effort is due to three key
problems. First, the current evaluation frameworks do not consider fundamental
concepts in model composition such as conflicts and inconsistencies. Second,
researchers and developers do not know what factors can influence the
composition effort in practice. Third, practical knowledge about how such
influential factors may affect the developers' effort is severely lacking. In
this context, the contributions of this thesis are threefold: (i) a quality
model for supporting the evaluation of model composition effort, (ii) practical
knowledge, derived from a family of quantitative and qualitative empirical
studies, about model composition effort and its influential factors, and (iii)
insight about how to evaluate model composition efforts and tame the side
effects of such influential factors.

the exponential parameterization matrix for neutrinos with account for the CP
violation. The complementarity hypothesis for quarks and neutrinos is
demonstrated to hold, despite significant change in the neutrino mixing data.
The values of the entries of the exponential mixing matrix are evaluated with
account for the actual degree of the CP violation in neutrino mixing and
without it. Various factorizations of the CP violating term are investigated in
the framework of the exponential parameterization.

equal to the Kullback-Leibler divergence when normalized. This loss function is
frequently used in the literature. However, there seems to be confusion about
the correct order in which its functional arguments, the approximated and

the optimal approximation is given by moment matching. This is in contrast to

attacks, or, somehow, nodes facing corrupted data --- classified as outliers.
One enabling application is the geographic localization of the network nodes.
However, despite excellent work on the network localization problem, prior
research seldom considered outlier data --- even now, when already deployed
networks cry out for robust procedures. We propose robust, fast, and
distributed network localization algorithms, resilient to high-power noise, but
also precise under regular Gaussian noise. We use the Huber M-estimator as a
difference measure between the distance of estimated nodes and noisy range
measurements, thus obtaining a robust (but nonconvex) optimization problem. We
then devise a convex underestimator solvable in polynomial time, and tight in
the inter-node terms. We also provide an optimality bound for the convex
underestimator. We put forward a new representation of the Huber function
composed with a norm, enabling distributed robust localization algorithms to
minimize the proposed underestimator. The synchronous distributed method has
optimal convergence rate and the asynchronous one converges in finite time, for
a given precision. The main highlight of our contribution lies on the fact that
we pay no price for distributed computation nor in accuracy, nor in
communication cost or convergence speed. Simulations show the advantage of
using our proposed algorithms, both in the presence of outliers and under
regular Gaussian noise: our method exceeds the accuracy of an alternative
robust approach based on L1 norms by at least 100m in an area of 1Km sides.

possible to derive not only one, but three predictions for three different
times within the intermediate interval. These predictions are moreover
contradictory. The particle (when looked for using a projective measurement)
seems to disappear from the first box where it would have been previously found
with certainty, appearing instead within the third box, to which no tunneling

the particle's nonlocal modular momentum spatially separated from its mass.
Another advance of this setting is that, unlike other predictions of the TSVF

actual projective measurements. This outcome is then corroborated by adding
weak measurements and the Aharonov-Bohm effect. The results strengthen the

typically addressed by using multiple, accurately chosen training signals to
recover the missing information on the sensing model, an approach that can be
resource-consuming and cumbersome. Conversely, blind calibration does not
employ any training signal, but corresponds to a bilinear inverse problem whose
algorithmic solution is an open issue. We here address blind calibration as a
non-convex problem for linear random sensing models, in which we aim to recover
an unknown signal from its projections on sub-Gaussian random vectors, each
subject to an unknown positive multiplicative factor (or gain). To solve this
optimisation problem we resort to projected gradient descent starting from a
suitable, carefully chosen initialisation point. An analysis of this algorithm
allows us to show that it converges to the exact solution provided a sample
complexity requirement is met, i.e., relating convergence to the amount of
information collected during the sensing process. Interestingly, we show that
this requirement grows linearly (up to log factors) in the number of unknowns
of the problem. This sample complexity is found both in absence of prior
information, as well as when subspace priors are available for both the signal
and gains, allowing a further reduction of the number of observations required
for our recovery guarantees to hold. Moreover, in the presence of noise we show
how our descent algorithm yields a solution whose accuracy degrades gracefully
with the amount of noise affecting the measurements. Finally, we present some
numerical experiments in an imaging context, where our algorithm allows for a
simple solution to blind calibration of the gains in a sensor array.

time-parallel numerical solution of systems of ordinary differential equations
(ODEs). The method assumes that low-dimensional bases that accurately capture
the time evolution of the state are available. The method adopts the parareal
framework for time parallelism, which is defined by an initialization method, a
coarse propagator, and a fine propagator. Rather than employing usual
approaches for initialization and coarse propagation, we propose novel
data-driven techniques that leverage the available time-evolution bases. The
coarse propagator is defined by a forecast (proposed in Ref. [12]) applied
locally within each coarse time interval, which comprises the following steps:
(1) apply the fine propagator for a small number of time steps, (2) approximate
the state over the entire coarse time interval using gappy POD with the local
time-evolution bases, and (3) select the approximation at the end of the time
interval as the propagated state. We also propose both local-forecast and
global-forecast initialization. The method is particularly well suited for
POD-based reduced-order models (ROMs). In this case, spatial parallelism
quickly saturates, as the ROM dynamical system is low dimensional; thus, time
parallelism is needed to enable lower wall times. Further, the time-evolution
bases can be extracted from the (readily available) right singular vectors
arising during POD computation. In addition to performing analyses related to
the method's accuracy, speedup, stability, and convergence, we also numerically
demonstrate the method's performance. Here, numerical experiments on ROMs for a
nonlinear convection-reaction problem demonstrate the method's ability to
realize near-ideal speedups; global-forecast initialization with a
local-forecast coarse propagator leads to the best performance.

the oppositely directed field lines in the injector region (primary
reconnecting current sheet), and 2) the poloidal flux compression near the

fluctuations arising from the current-sheet instability isolated near the

Alfven time scale). These modes saturate by breaking up the current sheet.
Second, for the first time a dynamo poloidal flux amplification is observed at
the reconnetion site (in the region of the oppositely directed magnetic field).
This fluctuation-induced flux amplification increases the local Lundquist
number, which then triggers a plasmoid instability and breaks the primary

establish the correspondence between synchronization problems in a topological
group $G$ over a connected graph $\Gamma$ and the moduli space of flat
principal $G$-bundles over $\Gamma$, and develop a discrete analogy of the
renowned theorem of classifying flat principal bundles with fix base and
structural group using the representation variety. In particular, we show that
prescribing an edge potential on a graph is equivalent to specifying an
equivalence class of flat principal bundles, of which the triviality of
holonomy dictates the synchronizability of the edge potential. We then develop
a twisted cohomology theory for associated vector bundles of the flat principal
bundle arising from an edge potential, which is a discrete version of the
twisted cohomology in differential geometry. This theory realizes the
obstruction to synchronizability as a cohomology group of the twisted de Rham
cochain complex. We then build a discrete twisted Hodge theory --- a fibre
bundle analog of the discrete Hodge theory on graphs --- which geometrically
realizes the graph connection Laplacian as a Hodge Laplacian of degree zero.
Motivated by our geometric framework, we study the problem of learning group
actions --- partitioning a collection of objects based on the local
synchronizability of pairwise correspondence relations. A dual interpretation
is to learn finitely generated subgroups of an ambient transformation group
from noisy observed group elements. A synchronization-based algorithm is also

capable of encoding both classical and quantum (field) theories, implements
spacetime locality in a manifest way and contains the complete modern notion of
measurement in the quantum case. Its mathematical content can be condensed into
a set of axioms that are similar to those of Atiyah and Segal. This is
supplemented by two basic rules for extracting probabilities or expectation
values for measurement processes. The framework, called the positive formalism,
is derived in three completely different ways. One derivation is from first
principles, one starts with classical field theory and one with quantum field
theory. The latter derivation arose previously in the programme of the general
boundary formulation of quantum theory. As in the convex operational framework,
the difference between classical and quantum theories essentially arises from
certain partially ordered vector spaces being either lattices or anti-lattices.
If we add the ad hoc ingredient of imposing anti-lattice structures, the
derivation from first principles may be seen as a reconstruction of quantum
theory. Among other things, the positive formalism suggests a statistical
approach to classical field theories with dynamical metric, provides a common
ground for quantum information theory and quantum field theory, introduces a
notion of local measurement into quantum field theory, and suggests a new
perspective on quantum gravity by removing the incompatibility with general
relativistic principles.

coding, but superposition of individual coded modulations expands the
modulation alphabet and distorts its configuration. Coded modulation over a
broadcast channel subject to a specific channel-input modulation constraint
remains an important open problem. Some progress has been made in the related
area of unequal-error protection modulations which can be considered
single-user broadcast transmission, but it does not approach all points on the
boundary of the capacity region. This paper studies broadcast coded modulation
using multilevel coding (MLC) subject to a specific channel input
constellation. The conditions under which multilevel codes can achieve the
constellation-constrained capacity of the AWGN broadcast channel are derived.
For any given constellation, we propose a pragmatic multilevel design technique
with near constellation-constrained-capacity performance where the coupling of
the superposition inner and outer codes are localized to each bit-level. It is
shown that this can be further relaxed to a code coupling on only one bit
level, with little or no penalty under natural labeling. The rate allocation
problem between the bit levels of the two users is studied and a pragmatic
method is proposed, again with near-capacity performance. In further pursuit of
lower complexity, a hybrid MLC-BICM is proposed, whose performance is shown to
be very close to the boundary of the constellation-constrained capacity region.
Simulation results show that good point-to-point LDPC codes produce excellent

and radio properties to be representative for the whole range of evolutionary

follow-up studies that will be presented in a series of papers. In the present
work we use the dust continuum emission to constrain the physical properties of
this sample and identify trends as a function of source evolution.
  We determine flux densities from mid-infrared to submm wavelength (8-870
micron) images and use these values to fit their spectral energy distributions
(SEDs) and determine their dust temperature and flux. Combining these with
recent distances from the literature including maser parallax measurements we
determine clump masses, luminosities and column densities. We find trends for
increasing temperature, luminosity and column density with the proposed
evolution sequence, confirming that this sample is representative of different
evolutionary stages of massive star formation. We show that most of the sample
has the ability to form massive stars (including the most massive O-type stars)
and that the majority is gravitationally unstable and hence likely to be
collapsing.
  The highest column density ATLASGAL sources presented cover the whole range
of evolutionary stages from the youngest to the most evolved high-mass star
forming clumps. Their study provides a unique starting point for more in-depth
research on massive star formation in four distinct evolutionary stages whose
well defined physical parameters afford more detailed studies. As most of the
sample is closer than 5 kpc, these sources are also ideal for follow-up
observations with high spatial resolution.

introduce a model of measure-valued processes that generalises this

  We see the urn composition at any time step $n$ as a measure ${\mathcal M}_n$

random colour $c$ according to the probability distribution proportional to

a scheduling problem to minimize weighted average completion time of N jobs on

solutions; in this article, we only discuss waves on finite background type of
solutions that have been proposed as theoretical models for freak wave events.
Three types of waves on finite background considered in this article are known
as the Soliton on Finite Background (SFB), the Ma solution and the rational
solution. In particular, two families of the SFB solutions deserve our special
attention. These are SFB$_{1}$ and SFB$_{2}$, where the latter one belongs to
higher order waves on finite background type of solution. These families of
solutions describe the Benjamin-Feir modulational instability phenomenon, which
has been verified theoretically, numerically and experimentally as the
phenomenon that a uniform continuous wave train is unstable under a very long
modulational perturbations of its envelope. A distinct difference between the
two families of solutions can be observed in the spectral domain, where
SFB$_{1}$ has one pair of initial sidebands and SFB$_{2}$ has two pairs of
initial sidebands within the interval of instability. The relationship between
SFB$_{1}$ and SFB$_{2}$ are explained and some important physical
characteristics of the two solutions are discussed. These include the amplitude
amplification factor, the spatial evolution of complex-valued envelopes, their
corresponding physical wave fields and the evolution of the corresponding wave
signals. Interestingly, wavefront dislocation and phase singularity are
observed in both families of the solution with different patterns, depending on
the value of the modulation wavelength and on the choice of parameters in

  Kampen--Flores-type Nonembeddability Result",,,,,"math.CO","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The fact that the complete graph $K_5$ does not embed in the plane has been
generalized in two independent directions. On the one hand, the solution of the
classical Heawood problem for graphs on surfaces established that the complete
graph $K_n$ embeds in a closed surface $M$ (other than the Klein bottle) if and
only if $(n-3)(n-4)\leq 6b_1(M)$, where $b_1(M)$ is the first $\mathbb
Z_2$-Betti number of $M$. On the other hand, van Kampen and Flores proved that
the $k$-skeleton of the $n$-dimensional simplex (the higher-dimensional
analogue of $K_{n+1}$) embeds in $\mathbb R^{2k}$ if and only if~$n \le 2k+1$.
  Two decades ago, K\""uhnel conjectured that the $k$-skeleton of the
$n$-simplex embeds in a compact, $(k-1)$-connected $2k$-manifold with $k$th
$\mathbb Z_2$-Betti number $b_k$ only if the following generalized Heawood
inequality holds: $\binom{n-k-1}{k+1} \le \binom{2k+1}{k+1}b_k$. This is a
common generalization of the case of graphs on surfaces as well as the van
Kampen--Flores theorem (the special cases $k=1$ and $b_k=0$, respectively), and
also closely related to the theory of face numbers of triangulated manifolds.
  In the spirit of K\""uhnel's conjecture, we prove that if the $k$-skeleton of
the $n$-simplex embeds in a $2k$-manifold with $k$th $\mathbb Z_2$-Betti number
$b_k$, then $n \le 2b_k\binom{2k+2}{k} + 2k + 4$. This bound is weaker than the
generalized Heawood inequality, but does not require the assumption that $M$ is
$(k-1)$-connected. Our results generalize to maps without $q$-covered points,
in the spirit of Tverberg's theorem, for $q$ a prime power. Our proof uses a
result of Volovikov about maps that satisfy a certain homological triviality
condition.

feature similarity of instances and the confidence scores assigned by the

Neptune in our solar system (30 AU), HIP 68468c is close-in, with a semi-major

discovery to date and the first super-Earth around a solar twin. Both
isochrones (5.9 Gyr) and the abundance ratio [Y/Mg] (6.4 Gyr) indicate an age
of about 6 billion years. The star is enhanced in refractory elements when
compared to the Sun, and the refractory enrichment is even stronger after
corrections for Galactic chemical evolution. We determined a NLTE Li abundance
of 1.52 dex, which is four times higher than what would be expected for the age
of HIP 68468. The older age is also supported by the low log(R'HK) (-5.05) and
low jitter. Engulfment of a rocky planet of 6 Earth masses can explain the
enhancement in both lithium and the refractory elements. [Conclusions]. The
super-Neptune planet candidate is too massive for in situ formation, and
therefore its current location is most likely the result of planet migration
that could also have driven other planets towards its host star, enhancing thus
the abundance of lithium and refractory elements in HIP 68468. The intriguing
evidence of planet accretion warrants further observations to verify the
existence of the planets that are indicated by our data and to better constrain
the nature of the planetary system around this unique star.

orthorhombic at about 150K, as opposed to small diameter one-dimensional
perovskite nanorods, of the order of 30-70 nm in diameter, where the phase
transition is inhibited and the dominant phase remains tetragonal. Two major
experimental techniques, infrared absorption spectroscopy and
photoluminescence, were utilized to probe the temperature dependence of the
perovskite phases over the 4-300K temperature range. Yet, different
characteristics of the phase transition were measured by the two spectroscopic
methods and explained by the presence of small, tetragonal inclusions embedded
in the orthorhombic phase. The inhibition of the phase transition is attributed
to the large surface area of these one-dimensional perovskite nanorods, which
gives rise to a large stress that, in turn, prevents the formation of the
orthorhombic phase. The absence of phase transition enables the measurement of
the tetragonal bandgap energy down to low temperatures.

matrix for the active neutrinos, $ m_{\nu}$, depends on the Dirac neutrino mass
matrix ($ M_{D} $), Majorana neutrino mass matrix ($ M_{R} $) and the mass
matrix ($ M_{S} $) coupling the right handed neutrinos and the singlet. The
model predicts one of the light neutrino masses to vanish. We systematically
investigate the zero textures in $ M_{D} $ and observe that maximum five zeros
in $ M_{D} $ can lead to viable zero textures in $ m_{\nu} $. For this study we
consider four different forms for $ M_R $ (one diagonal and three off diagonal)
and two different forms of $(M_{S})$ containing one zero. Remarkably we obtain
only two allowed forms of $ m_{\nu} $ ($m_{e\tau} = 0 $ and $m_{\tau\tau}=0$)
having inverted hierarchical mass spectrum. We re-analyze the phenomenological
implications of these two allowed textures of $m_\nu$ in the light of recent
neutrino oscillation data. In the context of the MES model, we also express the
low energy mass matrix, the mass of the sterile neutrino and the active-sterile
mixing in terms of the parameters of the allowed Yukawa matrices. The MES model
leads to some extra correlations which disallow some of the Yukawa textures
obtained earlier, even though they give allowed one-zero forms of $m_\nu$. We
show that the allowed textures in our study can be realized in a simple way in

studied for decades as a radiation source. The formation of the m = 0 plasma
instability during the compression phase is linked to the generation of
high-energy charged particle beams, which, when operated in deuterium, lead to
beam-target fusion reactions and the generation of neutron yield. In this
paper, we present a technique of seeding the m = 0 instability by employing a
hollow in the anode. As the plasma sheath moves along the anode's hollow
structure, a low density perturbation is formed and this creates a non-uniform
plasma column which is highly unstable. Dynamics of the low density
perturbation and preferential seeding of the m = 0 instability were studied in
detail with fully kinetic plasma simulations performed in the Large Scale
Plasma particle-in-cell code as well as with a simple snowplow model. The
simulations showed that by employing an anode geometry with appropriate inner
hollow radius, the neutron yield of the DPF is significantly improved and
low-yield shots are eliminated.

experienced by flapping wing fliers result in the reorientation of the
aerodynamic force vector that can render a substantial cumulative deficit in
the vertical force. We derive quantitative estimates of the body roll amplitude
and the related energetic requirements to maintain the weight support in free
flight under such conditions. We conduct force measurements of a miniature
hummingbird-inspired robotic flapper and numerical simulations of a bumblebee.
In both cases, we demonstrate the loss of weight support due to body roll
rotations. Using semi-restrained flight measurements, we demonstrate the
increased power requirements to maintain altitude in unsteady winds, achieved
by increasing the flapping frequency. Flapping fliers may increase their
flapping frequency as well as the stroke amplitude to produce the required
increase in aerodynamic force, both of these two types of compensatory control
requiring additional energetic cost. We analyze the existing data from
experiments on animals flying in von K\'arm\'an streets and find reasonable
agreement with the proposed theoretical model.

developed. Here we propose a local hybrid method derived from the optimized
effective potential (OEP) method and compare its distinct features with
conventional nonlocal ones from the Hartree-Fock (HF) exchange operator. Both
are formally exact for ground states and thus show similar accuracy for
atomization energies and reaction barrier heights. For excited states, the
local version yields virtual orbitals with N-electron character, while those of
the nonlocal version have mixed characters between N- and (N+1)-electron
orbitals. As a result, the orbital energy gaps from the former well approximate
excitation energies with a small mean absolute error (MAE = 0.40 eV) for the
Caricato benchmark set. The correction from time-dependent density functional
theory with a simple local density approximation kernel further improves its
accuracy by incorporating multi-configurational effects, resulting in the total
MAE of 0.27 eV that outperforms conventional functionals except for MN15.

individual TCP flow rate is persistently fluctuating over a range close to one
order of magnitude. The fluctuations are not short term but correlated over

differences with respect to ideal quantum ring in monolayer, AB-stacked bilayer
graphene and a quantum ring with finite width in AB-stacked bilayer graphene.

scattered light from the inner region of the disk around the GG Tau A system
was successfully detected in the $H$ band with a spatial resolution of
approximately 0.07$\arcsec$, revealing the complicated inner disk structures
around this young binary. This paper reports the observation of an arc-like
structure to the north of GG Tau Ab and part of a circumstellar structure that
is noticeable around GG Tau Aa extending to a distance of approximately 28 AU
from the primary star. The speckle noise around GG Tau Ab constrains its disk
radius to <13 AU. Based on the size of the circumbinary ring and the
circumstellar disk around GG Tau Aa, the semi-major axis of the binary's orbit
is likely to be 62 AU. A comparison of the present observations with previous
ALMA and near-infrared (NIR) H$_2$ emission observations suggests that the
north arc could be part of a large streamer flowing from the circumbinary ring
to sustain the circumstellar disks. According to the previous studies, the
circumstellar disk around GG Tau Aa has enough mass and can sustain itself for
a duration sufficient for planet formation; thus, our study indicates that
planets can form within close (separation $\lesssim$ 100 AU) young binary
systems.

interval and is needed for reliable detection. In this paper, we develop a
symbol synchronization framework for molecular communication (MC) systems where
we consider some practical challenges which have not been addressed in the
literature yet. In particular, we take into account that in MC systems, the
transmitter may not be equipped with an internal clock and may not be able to
emit molecules with a fixed release frequency. Such restrictions hold for
practical nanotransmitters, e.g. modified cells, where the lengths of the
symbol intervals may vary due to the inherent randomness in the availability of
food and energy for molecule generation, the process for molecule production,
and the release process. To address this issue, we propose to employ two types
of molecules, one for synchronization and one for data transmission. We derive
the optimal maximum likelihood (ML) symbol synchronization scheme as a
performance upper bound. Since ML synchronization entails high complexity, we
also propose two low-complexity synchronization schemes, namely a peak
observation-based scheme and a threshold-trigger scheme, which are suitable for
MC systems with limited computational capabilities. Our simulation results
reveal the effectiveness of the proposed synchronization~schemes and suggest
that the end-to-end performance of MC systems significantly depends on the

to theoretically demonstrate that the usual application of the superposition
principle in slit based interference experiments is often incorrect. This has
caveat in both optics and quantum mechanics where it is often naively assumed
that the boundary condition represented by slits opened individually is same as
them being opened together. The correction term comes from exotic sub leading
terms in the Path Integral which can be described by what are popularly called
non-classical paths. In this work, we report an experiment where we have a
controllable parameter that can be varied in its contribution such that the
effect due to these non-classical paths can be increased or diminished at will.
Thus, the reality of these non-classical paths is brought forth in a classical
experiment using microwaves, thereby proving that the boundary condition effect
being investigated transcends the classical-quantum divide. We report the first
measurement of a deviation (as big as $6\%$) from the superposition principle
in the microwave domain using antennas as sources and detectors of the
electromagnetic waves. We also show that our results can have potential

range $2<z<3.5$. Analysing the Ly$\alpha$ forest auto-correlation function
using the full quasar sample, we find $s_0=0.081\pm0.006h^{-1}$Mpc. We then
investigate the clustering and dynamics of Ly$\alpha$ forest absorbers around
$z\sim3$ LBGs. From the redshift-space cross-correlation, we find
$s_0=0.27\pm0.14h^{-1}$Mpc, with power-law slope $\gamma=1.1\pm0.2$. We make a
first analysis of the dependence of this clustering length on absorber strength
based on cuts in the sightline transmitted flux, finding a clear preference for
stronger absorption features to be more strongly clustered around the galaxy
population than weaker absorption features. Further, we calculate the projected
correlation function, finding $r_0=0.24\pm0.04h^{-1}$Mpc (assuming a fixed
slope $\gamma=1.1$). Taking this as the underlying real-space clustering, we
fit the 2D cross-correlation function with a dynamical model incorporating the
infall parameter and the peculiar velocity, finding $\beta_{\rm F}=1.02\pm0.22$
and $240\pm60$ km s$^{-1}$ respectively. This result shows a significant
detection of gas infall relative to the galaxy population, whilst the measured
velocity dispersion is consistent with the velocity uncertainties on the galaxy
redshifts. We evaluate the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality between the galaxy-galaxy,
absorber-absorber, and galaxy-absorber correlation functions, finding a result
significantly less than unity: $\xi_{\rm ag}^2/(\xi_{\rm gg}\xi_{\rm
aa})=0.25\pm0.14$, implying that galaxies and Ly$\alpha$ absorbers do not
linearly trace the underlying dark matter distribution in the same way.

model can produce relatively large and nonmonotonic Bloch-Siegert shifts in the
cavity frequency as the system is driven through a quantum-to-classical
transition. Using a weak microwave probe tone, we demonstrate experimentally
this effect by monitoring the resonance frequency of a microwave cavity coupled
to a transmon and driven by a microwave field with varying power. In the weakly
driven regime (quantum phase), the Bloch-Siegert shift appears as a small
constant frequency shift, while for strong drive (classical phase) it presents
an oscillatory behaviour as a function of the number of photons in the cavity.
The experimental results are in agreement with numerical simulations based on
the quasienergy spectrum.

expensive to develop. Thus, a crucial prerequisite for ontology adoption and
reuse is effective support for exploring and finding existing ontologies.
Towards that goal, the National Center for Biomedical Ontology (NCBO) has
developed BioPortal---an online repository designed to support users in
exploring and finding more than 500 existing biomedical ontologies. In 2016,
BioPortal represents one of the largest portals for exploration of semantic
biomedical vocabularies and terminologies, which is used by many researchers
and practitioners. While usage of this portal is high, we know very little
about how exactly users search and explore ontologies and what kind of usage
patterns or user groups exist in the first place. Deeper insights into user
behavior on such portals can provide valuable information to devise strategies
for a better support of users in exploring and finding existing ontologies, and
thereby enable better ontology reuse. To that end, we study and group users
according to their browsing behavior on BioPortal using data mining techniques.
Additionally, we use the obtained groups to characterize and compare
exploration strategies across ontologies. In particular, we were able to
identify seven distinct browsing-behavior types, which all make use of
different functionality provided by BioPortal. For example, Search Explorers
make extensive use of the search functionality while Ontology Tree Explorers
mainly rely on the class hierarchy to explore ontologies. Further, we show that
specific characteristics of ontologies influence the way users explore and
interact with the website. Our results may guide the development of more
user-oriented systems for ontology exploration on the Web.

the sensitivity of the relative expressiveness of user-defined effects to

effect handlers and monadic reflection, a set-theoretic denotational semantics.
We establish their basic meta-theoretic properties: safety, termination, and,
where applicable, soundness and adequacy. Using Felleisen's notion of a macro
translation, we show that these abstractions can macro-express each other, and
show which translations preserve typeability. We use the adequate finitary

effect handlers cannot be macro-expressed while preserving typeability either
by monadic reflection or by delimited control. We supplement our development

biomedical technologies. However, the full characterization of these quantum
emitters is currently restricted to the visible wavelengths and it remains a
key challenge to optically probe single CQDs operating in the infrared spectral
domain which is targeted by a growing number of applications. Here, we report
the first experimental detection and imaging at room temperature of single
infrared CQDs operating at telecommunication wavelengths. Imaging was done with
a doubly resonant bowtie nano-aperture antenna (BNA) written at the end of a
fiber nanoprobe, whose resonances spectrally fit the CQD absorption and
emission wavelengths. Direct near-field characterization of PbS CQDs reveal
individual nanocrystals with a spatial resolution of 75 nm (lambda/20) together
with their intrinsic 2D dipolar free-space emission properties and exciton
dynamics (blinking phenomenon). Because the doubly resonant BNA is strongly
transmissive at both the CQD absorption and emission wavelengths, we are able
to perform all-fiber nano-imaging with a standard 20 % efficiency InGaAs
avalanche photodiode (APD). Detection efficiency is predicted to be 3000 fold
larger than with a conventional circular aperture tip of the same transmission
area. Double resonance BNA fiber probes thus offer the possibility of exploring
extreme light-matter interaction in low band gap CQDs with current
plug-and-play detection techniques, opening up new avenues in the fields of
infrared light emitting devices, photodetectors, telecommunications,
bio-imaging and quantum information technology.

demonstrating the connection between pipelined query engines and loop fusion

both approaches. Then we experimentally evaluate the various engines, in the
context of query compilation, for the first time in a fair environment,
eliminating the biasing impact of ancillary optimizations that have
traditionally only been used with one of the approaches. We show that for
realistic analytical workloads, there is no considerable advantage for either

Also, by using microbenchmarks we show that our proposed engine dominates the

between an LPV state-space (SS) representation with a general noise structure
and the LPV-SS model in an innovation structure, i.e., the Kalman filter. More
specifically, the considered LPV-SS representation with general noise structure
has static, affine dependence on the scheduling signal; however, we show that
its companion innovation structure has a dynamic, rational dependency
structure. Following, we would like to highlight the consequences of
approximating this Kalman gain by a static, affine dependency structure. To
this end, firstly, we use the ""fading memory"" effect of the Kalman filter to
reason how the Kalman gain can be approximated to depend only on a partial
trajectory of the scheduling signal. This effect is shown by proving an
asymptotically decreasing error upper bound on the covariance matrix associated
to the innovation structure in case the covariance matrix is subjected to an
incorrect initialization or disturbance. Secondly, we show by an example that
an LPV-SS representation that has dynamical, rational dependency on the
scheduling signal can be transformed into static, affinely dependent
representation by introducing additional states. Therefore, an approximated
Kalman gain can, in some cases, be represented by a static, affine Kalman gain
at the cost of additional states.

components with different mean metallicities, and possibly different spatial
distribution and kinematics. As a consequence, both the metallicity
distribution and the radial velocity of bulge stars vary across different line
of sights. We present here the metallicity distribution function of red clump
stars in 26 fields spread across a wide area of the bulge, with special
emphasis on fields close to Galactic plane, at latitudes b=-2 and b=-1, that
were not explored before. This paper includes new metallicities from a sample
of about 5000 K giant stars, observed at spectral resolution R=6500, in the
Calcium II Triplet region. They are the main dataset of the GIRAFFE Inner Bulge
Survey. As part of the same survey we have previously published results for a
sample of about 600 K giant stars, at latitude b=-4 , derived from higher
resolution spectra (R=22,500). Results. The combined sample allows us to trace
and characterize the metal poor and metal rich bulge populations down to the
inner bulge. We present a density map for each of the two components. Contrary
to the expectations from previous works, we found the metal poor population to
be more centrally concentrated than the metal rich one, and with a more
axisymmetric spatial distribution. The metal rich population, on the other
hand, is arranged in a boxy distribution, consistent with an edge-on bar. By
coupling metallicities and radial velocities we show that the metal poor
population has a velocity dispersion that varies rather mildly with latitude.
On the contrary, the metal rich population has a low velocity dispersion far
from the plane (b=-8.5), but it has a steeper gradient with latitude, becoming
higher than the metal poor one in the innermost field (b=-1). [abridged]

more relevant in weakly-interacting dipolar condensates than in their

quantum corrections in dipolar and non-dipolar condensates are strikingly
different due to the peculiar momentum dependence of the dipolar interactions.
The energy correction of the condensate presents not only a modified density
dependence, but it may even change from attractive to repulsive at a critical
density due to the surprising role played by the transversal directions. The
anomalous quantum correction translates into a strongly modified physics for
quantum-stabilized droplets and dipolar solitons. Moreover, and for similar
reasons, quantum corrections of three-body correlations, and hence of
three-body losses, are strongly modified by the dipolar interactions. This
intriguing physics can be readily probed in current experiments with magnetic

the free energy, and the discrete valued function defining the partition is
called the collective variable. The algorithm falls into the general class of
Wang-Landau type methods, and is a generalization of the original Self Healing
Umbrella Sampling method in two ways: (i) the updating strategy leads to a
larger penalization strength of already visited sets in order to escape more
quickly from metastable states, and (ii) the target distribution is biased
using only a fraction of the free energy, in order to increase the effective
sample size and reduce the variance of importance sampling estimators. The
algorithm can also be seen as a generalization of well-tempered metadynamics.
We prove the convergence of the algorithm and analyze numerically its
efficiency on a toy example.

consequences in terms of duality for excursions of L\'evy processes. It implies
in particular that the local time process of this excursion is also invariant

the extraction of information from magnetization measurements. The results are
most unambiguous for irreversible processes -- for a collection of Preisach
hysterons, one gets a ""FORC distribution"" $\rho(H_{down},H_{up})$, the number
of hysterons with given downward \& upward reversal fields. There have been
many proposals for dealing with reversible behavior, usually involving
inserting it somehow into the irreversible FORC distribution. Here we will try
to do the opposite, to separate them into another function which we will call
the (reversible) ""saturation field distribution"", which is identically zero for
a completely irreversible system of hysterons, while the irreversible FORC
distribution is identically zero for a reversible system. Thus in a system with
both purely reversible and purely irreversible components, such as
single-domain Stoner-Wohlfarth particles with hard or easy axis along the
field, this approach cleanly separates them. For more complicated systems, as
with conventional FORC distributions, it at least provides a ""signature"" making
it possible to identify microscopic models that might give a particular pair of

  laser beams",,,,,"physics.plasm-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The radiation reaction effects on electron dynamics in counter-propagating
circularly polarized laser beams are investigated through the linearization
theorem and the results are in great agreement with numeric solutions. For the
first time, the properties of fixed points in electron phase-space were
analyzed with linear stability theory, showing that center nodes will become
attractors if the classical radiation reaction is considered. Electron dynamics
are significantly affected by the properties of the fixed points and the
electron phase-space densities are found to be increasing exponentially near
the attractors. The density growth rates are derived theoretically and further
verified by particle-in-cell simulations, which can be detected in experiments
to explore the effects of radiation reaction qualitatively. The attractor can
also facilitate to realize a series of nanometer-scaled flying electron slices
via adjusting the colliding laser frequencies.

$n$ budget constrained buyers. Each buyer is interested in a subset of the
items on sale, and she appraises at some single-value every item in her
preference-set. Moreover, each buyer has a budget that constraints the maximum
affordable payment, while she aims to obtain as many items as possible of her
preference-set. Our goal is to compute an envy-free pricing allocation that
maximizes the revenue, i.e., the total payment charged to the buyers. This
pricing problem is hard to approximate better than $\Omega({\rm min}
\{n,m\}^{1/2-\epsilon})$ for any $\epsilon>0$, unless $P=NP$. The hardness
result is due to the presence of the matching constraints given that the
simpler multi-unit case can be approximated up to a constant factor of $2$. The
goal of this paper is to circumvent the hardness result by restricting
ourselves to specific settings of valuations and budgets. Two particularly
significant scenarios are: each buyer has a budget that is greater than her
single-value valuation, and each buyer has a budget that is lower than her
single-value valuation. Surprisingly, in both scenarios we are able to achieve
a $1/4$-approximation to the optimal envy-free revenue. The algorithms utilize
a novel version of the Ausebel ascending price auction. These results may
suggest that, although it is difficult to approximate the optimal revenue in
general, ascending price auctions could achieve relatively good revenue in most
of the practical settings.

Now-a-days social media is perfectly representing the public sentiment and
opinion about current events. Especially, twitter has attracted a lot of
attention from researchers for studying the public sentiments. Stock market
prediction on the basis of public sentiments expressed on twitter has been an
intriguing field of research. Previous studies have concluded that the
aggregate public mood collected from twitter may well be correlated with Dow
Jones Industrial Average Index (DJIA). The thesis of this work is to observe
how well the changes in stock prices of a company, the rises and falls, are
correlated with the public opinions being expressed in tweets about that
company. Understanding author's opinion from a piece of text is the objective
of sentiment analysis. The present paper have employed two different textual
representations, Word2vec and N-gram, for analyzing the public sentiments in
tweets. In this paper, we have applied sentiment analysis and supervised
machine learning principles to the tweets extracted from twitter and analyze
the correlation between stock market movements of a company and sentiments in
tweets. In an elaborate way, positive news and tweets in social media about a
company would definitely encourage people to invest in the stocks of that
company and as a result the stock price of that company would increase. At the
end of the paper, it is shown that a strong correlation exists between the rise
and falls in stock prices with the public sentiments in tweets.

class two-ribbon flare on July 5, 2012. The flare was observed with the 1.6
meter aperture New Solar Telescope at Big Bear Solar Observatory. For this
unique data set, sunspot dynamics during flaring were analyzed for the first
time. By directly imaging the upper chromosphere, running penumbral waves are
clearly seen as an outward extension of umbral flashes, both take the form of
absorption in the 10830 \AA\ narrow-band images. From a space-time image made
of a slit cutting across a flare ribbon and the sunspot, we find that the dark
lanes for umbral flashes and penumbral waves are obviously broadened after the
flare. The most prominent feature is the sudden appearance of an oscillating
absorption strip inside the ribbon when it sweeps into the sunspot's penumbral
and umbral regions. During each oscillation, outwardly propagating umbral
flashes and subsequent penumbral waves rush out into the inwardly sweeping
ribbon, followed by a returning of the absorption strip with similar speed. We
tentatively explain the phenomena as the result of a sudden increase in the
density of ortho-Helium atoms in the area of the sunspot being excited by the
flare's EUV illumination. This explanation is based on the observation that
10830 \AA\ absorption around the sunspot area gets enhanced during the flare.
Nevertheless, questions are still open and we need further well-devised
observations to investigate the behavior of sunspot dynamics during flares.

large amplitude X-ray variability. In this study we have carefully re-analysed
radio and X-ray observations using the same methods as our previous work, we
again find no evidence for core radio variability. In direct contrast to our

anti-correlation between radio and X-ray data for the same source. The other
study report only integral flux values and do not consider the effect of the
changing array on the synthesised beam. In both our studies of NGC 4051 we have
taken great care to account for the effect that the changing beam size has on
the measured radio flux and as a result we are confident that our method gives
more accurate values for the intrinsic core radio flux. However, the lack of
radio variability we find is hard to reconcile because radio images of NGC 4051
do show jet-like structure. We suggest that the radio structures observed are
likely the result of a previous period of higher radio activity and that the
current level of radio emission from a compact nuclear jet is low.

the strength of the $\pi NN$, $\pi N\Delta$ and $\pi\Delta\Delta$ couplings and

2^{aL^\prime(X)\chi(X)}$ for any Hausdorff space $X$ (a corollary of Theorem
4.4. This invariant has the properties a) $aL^\prime(X)=\aleph_0$ if $X$ is
H-closed, and b) $aL(X)\leq aL^\prime(X)\leq aL_c(X)$. Theorem 4.4 then gives a
new improvement of the well-known Hausdorff bound $2^{L(X)\chi(X)}$ from which
it follows that $|X|\leq 2^{\psi_c(X)}$ if $X$ is H-closed (Dow/Porter [5]).
The invariant $aL^\prime(X)$ is constructed using convergent open ultrafilters
and an operator $c:\scr{P}(X)\to\scr{P}(X)$ with the property $clA\subseteq
c(A)\subseteq cl_\theta(A)$ for all $A\subseteq X$. As a comparison with this
open ultrafilter approach, in $\S 3$ we additionally give a $\kappa$-filter
variation of Hodel's proof [10] of the Dow-Porter result. Finally, for an
infinite cardinal $\kappa$, in $\S 5$ we introduce $\kappa$wH-closed spaces,
$\kappa H^\prime$-closed spaces, and $\kappa H^{\prime\prime}$-closed spaces.
The first two notions generalize the H-closed property. Key results in this
connection are that a) if $\kappa$ is an infinite cardinal and $X$ a
$\kappa$wH-closed space with a dense set of isolated points such that
$\chi(X)\leq\kappa$, then $|X|\leq 2^{\kappa}$, and b) if $X$ is $\kappa
H^\prime$-closed or $\kappa H^{\prime\prime}$-closed then
$aL^\prime(X)\leq\kappa$. This latter result relates these notions to the
invariant $aL^\prime(X)$ and the operator $c$.

challenging, it must be supported in competition with established research

interest around novel molecular research topics. Specifically, it identifies
paths of molecular interactions that connect research topics and hypotheses
that would not typically be associated, as the basis for scientific
collaboration. Because these collaborations are related to the scientists'
present trajectory, they are low risk and can be initiated rapidly. Unlike most
incremental steps, these collaborations have the potential for leaps in
understanding, as they reposition research for novel disease applications. We
demonstrate the use of this tool to identify scientists who could contribute to
understanding the cellular role of genes with novel associations with
Alzheimer's disease, which have not been thoroughly characterized, in part due
to the funding emphasis on established research.

condensations near coronal loop-tops in thermally unstable post-flare arcades.
We detect 5 phases that characterise the post-flare decay: heating,
evaporation, conductive cooling dominance for ~120 s, radiative / enthalpy
cooling dominance for ~4700 s and finally catastrophic cooling occurring within
35-124 s leading to rain strands with s periodicity of 55-70 s. We find an
excellent agreement between the observations and model predictions of the
dominant cooling timescales and the onset of catastrophic cooling. At the rain
formation site we detect co-moving, multi-thermal rain clumps that undergo
catastrophic cooling from ~1 MK to ~22000 K. During catastrophic cooling the
plasma cools at a maximum rate of 22700 K s-1 in multiple loop-top sources. We
calculated the density of the EUV plasma from the DEM of the multi-thermal
source employing regularised inversion. Assuming a pressure balance, we
estimate the density of the chromospheric component of rain to be 9.21x10^11
+-1.76x10^11 cm-3 which is comparable with quiescent coronal rain densities.
With up to 8 parallel strands in the EUV loop cross section, we calculate the
mass loss rate from the post-flare arcade to be as much as 1.98x10^12
+/-4.95x10^11 g s-1. Finally, we reveal a close proximity between the model
predictions of 10^5.8 K and the observed properties between 10^5.9 K and 10^6.2
K, that defines the temperature onset of catastrophic cooling. The close
correspondence between the observations and numerical models suggests that
indeed acoustic waves (with a sound travel time of 68 s) could play an
important role in redistributing energy and sustaining the enthalpy-based
radiative cooling.

associated solvers running in parallel introduces integration errors, which
must be kept inside acceptable bounds.
  CHOPtrey denotes a forecasting framework enhancing the performance of complex
system co-simulation, with a trivalent articulation. First, we consider the
framework of a Computationally Hasty Online Prediction system (CHOPred). It
allows to improve the trade-off between integration speed-ups, needing large
communication steps, and simulation precision, needing frequent updates for
model inputs. Second, smoothed adaptive forward prediction improves
co-simulation accuracy. It is obtained by past-weighted extrapolation based on
Causal Hopping Oblivious Polynomials (CHOPoly). And third, signal behavior is
segmented to handle the discontinuities of the exchanged signals: the
segmentation is performed in a Contextual \& Hierarchical Ontology of Patterns
(CHOPatt).
  Implementation strategies and simulation results demonstrate the framework
ability to adaptively relax data communication constraints beyond
synchronization points which sensibly accelerate simulation. The CHOPtrey
framework extends the range of applications of standard Lagrange-type methods,
often deemed unstable. The embedding of predictions in lag-dependent smoothing

pattern explosion. Instead of enumerating all patterns that satisfy the
constraints, individual patterns are sampled proportional to a given quality
measure. Several sampling algorithms have been proposed, but each of them has
its limitations when it comes to 1) flexibility in terms of quality measures
and constraints that can be used, and/or 2) guarantees with respect to sampling
accuracy. We therefore present Flexics, the first flexible pattern sampler that
supports a broad class of quality measures and constraints, while providing
strong guarantees regarding sampling accuracy. To achieve this, we leverage the
perspective on pattern mining as a constraint satisfaction problem and build
upon the latest advances in sampling solutions in SAT as well as existing
pattern mining algorithms. Furthermore, the proposed algorithm is applicable to
a variety of pattern languages, which allows us to introduce and tackle the
novel task of sampling sets of patterns. We introduce and empirically evaluate

motion of electrons on their intrinsic time scales. Spin-flip dynamics is
usually considered in the context of valence electronic states, where
spin-orbit coupling is weak and processes related to the electron spin are
usually driven by nuclear motion. However, for core-excited states, where the
core hole has a nonzero angular momentum, spin-orbit coupling is strong enough
to drive spin-flips on a much shorter time scale. Using density matrix based
time-dependent restricted active space configuration interaction including
spin-orbit coupling, we address an unprecedentedly short spin-crossover for the
example of L-edge (2p$\rightarrow$3d) excited states of a prototypical Fe(II)
complex. This process occurs on a time scale, which is faster than that of
Auger decay ($\sim$4\,fs) treated here explicitly. Modest variations of carrier
frequency and pulse duration can lead to substantial changes in the spin-state
yield, suggesting its control by soft X-ray light.

that electron-initiated impact ionization is weaker than the hole-initiated

resilience to impact ionization initiated breakdown. Moreover, calculated
minority electron lifetimes are limited by radiative recombination only, not by

  Factorization","6 pages + 1 reference page",,,,"cs.LG cs.IR stat.ML","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The objective function of a matrix factorization model usually aims to
minimize the average of a regression error contributed by each element.
However, given the existence of stochastic noises, the implicit deviations of
sample data from their true values are almost surely diverse, which makes each
data point not equally suitable for fitting a model. In this case, simply
averaging the cost among data in the objective function is not ideal.
Intuitively we would like to emphasize more on the reliable instances (i.e.,
those contain smaller noise) while training a model. Motivated by such
observation, we derive our formula from a theoretical framework for optimal
weighting under heteroscedastic noise distribution. Specifically, by modeling
and learning the deviation of data, we design a novel matrix factorization
model. Our model has two advantages. First, it jointly learns the deviation and
conducts dynamic reweighting of instances, allowing the model to converge to a
better solution. Second, during learning the deviated instances are assigned
lower weights, which leads to faster convergence since the model does not need
to overfit the noise. The experiments are conducted in clean recommendation and
noisy sensor datasets to test the effectiveness of the model in various
scenarios. The results show that our model outperforms the state-of-the-art
factorization and deep learning models in both accuracy and efficiency.

repulsion is expected to be a general phenomenon for spatially-confined quantum

  with closed field lines",,,,,"math.NA","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In magnetized plasma, the magnetic field confines particles around field
lines. The ratio between the intensity of the parallel and perpendicular
viscosity or heat conduction may reach the order of $10^{12}$. When the
magnetic fields have closed field lines and form a ""magnetic island"", the
convergence order of most known schemes depends on the anisotropy strength. In
this paper, by integration of the original differential equation along each
closed field line, we introduce a simple but very efficient asymptotic
preserving reformulation, which yields uniform convergence with respect to the
anisotropy strength. Only slight modification to the original code is required
and neither change of coordinates nor mesh adaptation is needed. Numerical
examples demonstrating the performance of the new scheme are presented.

long history in the recreational mathematical literature. One of the most
commercially famous of these puzzles is the Instant Insanity that consists of
four cubes. Their faces are coloured with four different colours in such a way
that each colour is present in each one of the four cubes. To solve the puzzle,
one needs to stack the cubes in a tower in such a way that each one of the
colours appears exactly once in the four long faces of the tower. The main
purpose of this paper is to study the combinatorial richness of a mathematical
model of this puzzle by analysing all possible ways of colouring the cubes to
form a puzzle analogous to the Instant Insanity. We have done this analysis for
$n$ cubes and $n$ colours for $n=4, 5, 6$. This combinatorial analysis allowed
us to design the Mutando of Insanity, a puzzle that we presented at Gathering

transportation. Unleashing such potential, however, requires understanding how
urban parameters affect the fraction of individual trips that can be shared, a
quantity that we call shareability. Using data on millions of taxi trips in New
York City, San Francisco, Singapore, and Vienna, we compute the shareability
curves for each city, and find that a natural rescaling collapses them onto a
single, universal curve. We explain this scaling law theoretically with a
simple model that predicts the potential for ride sharing in any city, using a
few basic urban quantities and no adjustable parameters. Accurate
extrapolations of this type will help planners, transportation companies, and
society at large to shape a sustainable path for urban growth.

the effectiveness of different forms of implementation remains uncertain,
trials that not only generate information about intervention effects but also
provide public health benefit would be useful. Cluster randomized trials (CRT)
capture both direct and indirect intervention effects; the latter depends
heavily on contact networks within and across clusters. We propose a novel
class of connectivity-informed trial designs that leverages information about
such networks in order to improve public health impact and preserve ability to
detect intervention effects.
  Methods: We consider CRTs in which the order of enrollment is based on the
total number of ties between individuals across clusters (based either on the
total number of inter-cluster connections or on connections only to untreated
clusters). We include options analogous both to traditional Parallel and
Stepped Wedge designs. We also allow for control clusters to be ""held-back""
from re-randomization for some period. We investigate the performance epidemic
control and power to detect vaccine effect performance of these designs by
simulating vaccination trials during an SEIR-type epidemic using a
network-structured agent-based model.
  Results: In our simulations, connectivity-informed designs have lower peak
infectiousness than comparable traditional designs and reduce cumulative
incidence by 20%, but with little impact on time to end of epidemic and reduced
power to detect differences in incidence across clusters. However even a brief
""holdback"" period restores most of the power lost compared to traditional
approaches.
  Conclusion: Incorporating information about cluster connectivity in design of
CRTs can increase their public health impact, especially in acute outbreak
settings, with modest cost in power to detect an effective intervention.

  Networks",,,,,"physics.soc-ph cs.SI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In recent years, there has been growing interest in the study of
coevolutionary games on networks. Despite much progress, little attention has
been paid to spatially embedded networks, where the underlying geographic
distance, rather than the graph distance, is an important and relevant aspect
of the partner rewiring process. It thus remains largely unclear how individual
partner rewiring range preference, local vs. global, emerges and affects
cooperation. Here we explicitly address this issue using a coevolutionary model
of cooperation and partner rewiring range preference in spatially embedded
social networks. In contrast to local rewiring, global rewiring has no distance
restriction but incurs a one-time cost upon establishing any long range link.
We find that under a wide range of model parameters, global partner switching
preference can coevolve with cooperation. Moreover, the resulting partner
network is highly degree-heterogeneous with small average shortest path length
while maintaining high clustering, thereby possessing small-world properties.
We also discover an optimum availability of reputation information for the
emergence of global cooperators, who form distant partnerships at a cost to
themselves. From the coevolutionary perspective, our work may help explain the
ubiquity of small-world topologies arising alongside cooperation in the real
world.

electrodes. We report on the characteristics of a new class of asymmetric
meshes, tiled using a recently-discovered family of pentagons. Micron-scale
meshes were fabricated on flexible polyethylene terephthalate substrates via
optical lithography, metal evaporation (Ti 10 nm, Pt 50 nm) and lift-off. Three
different designs were assessed, each with the same tessellation pattern and
linewidth (5 micron), but with different sizes of the fundamental pentagonal
unit. The designs corresponded to areal coverage of the metal patterns of 27%
(Design#1), 14% (Design#2) and 9% (Design#3), respectively. Good mechanical
stability was observed for both tensile strain and compressive strain. After
1,000 bending cycles, devices subjected to tensile strain showed fractional
resistance increases in the range 8% to 17% with the lowest changes observed
for Design#2. Devices subjected to compressive strain showed fractional
resistance increases in the range 0% to 7% with best results observed for
Design#1. The performance of the pentagonal metal mesh devices as visible
transparent heaters via Joule heating was also assessed. A saturation
temperature of 88 +/- 1 degrees C was achieved at low voltage (5 V) with a fast
response time (~ 20 s) and a high thermal resistance (168 +/- 6 degrees C
cm2/W). Finally, de-icing was successfully demonstrated (45 s at 5 V) for an
ice layer on a glass coupon placed on top of the PET substrate.

considered as a principal task of on-site inspection under the Comprehensive
nuclear-test-ban treaty. On September 11, 2016, a seismic event with body wave
magnitude 2.1 was found in automatic processing near the epicenter of the
underground explosion conducted by the DPRK on September 9, 2016. This event
occurred approximately two days after the test. Using the WCC method, two array
stations of the International Monitoring System (IMS), USRK and KSRS, detected
Pn-wave arrivals, which were associated with a unique event. Standard automatic
processing at the International Data Centre (IDC) did not create an event
hypothesis, but in the following interactive processing based on WCC
detections, an IDC analyst was able to create a two-station event . Location
and other characteristics of this small seismic source indicate that it is
likely an aftershock of the preceding explosion. Building on the success of
automatic detection and phase association, we carried out an extended analysis,
which included later phases and closest non-IMS stations. The final cross
correlation solution uses four stations, including MDJ (China) and SEHB
(Republic of Korea), with the epicenter approximately 2 km to north-west from
the epicenter of the Sept. 9 test. We also located the aftershock epicenter by
standard IDC program LocSAT using the arrival times obtained by cross
correlation. The distance between the DPRK and LocSAT aftershock epicenters is
25.5 km, i.e. by an order of magnitude larger than that obtained by the WCC
relative location method.
