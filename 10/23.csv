effect from a rotating 5 dimensional Myers-Perry black hole (5D-MPBH) with two
independent angular momentum components. First, we investigate the Hawking
temperature by considering the tunneling of massive scalar particles and spin-1
vector particles from the 5D-MPBH in the Painlev\'{e} coordinates and then in
the corotating frames. More specifically, we solve the Klein-Gordon and Proca
equations by applying the WKB method and Hamilton-Jacobi equation in both
cases. Finally, we recover the Hawking temperature and show that coordinates
systems do not affect the Hawking temperature.

power law creep followed by fluidization. A fundamental understanding of these
processes is still far from being achieved. Here, we characterize creep and
fluidization on the basis of a mesoscopic viscoplastic model that includes
thermally activated yielding events and a broad distribution of energy
barriers, which may be lowered under the effect of a local deformation. We
relate the creep exponent observed before fluidization to the width of barrier
distribution and to the specific form of stress redistribution following
yielding events. We show that Andrade creep is accompanied by local
strain-hardening driven by stress redistribution and find that the fluidization
depends exponentially on the applied stress. The simulation results are
interpreted in the light of a mean-field analysis, and should help in
rationalizing the creep phenomenology of amorphous solids.

behaviors evolve. In many recent works, evolutionary competition between
strategies is modeled as a stochastic process in a finite population. In this
context, two limits are both mathematically convenient and biologically
relevant: weak selection and large population size. These limits can be
combined in different ways, leading to potentially different results. We
consider two orderings: the wN limit, in which weak selection is applied before
the large population limit, and the Nw limit, in which the order is reversed.
Formal mathematical definitions of the Nw and wN limits are provided. Applying
these definitions to the Moran process of evolutionary game theory, we obtain
asymptotic expressions for fixation probability and conditions for success in
these limits. We find that the asymptotic expressions for fixation probability,
and the conditions for a strategy to be favored over a neutral mutation, are
different in the Nw and wN limits. However, the ordering of limits does not
affect the conditions for one strategy to be favored over another.

learning algorithms, including the popular ConvNets, are black boxes: little is

which pixels in images play a role in the image-level predictions. In other
words, a ConvNet trained for image-level classification can be used to detect
lesions as well. A generalization of the backpropagation method is proposed in
order to train ConvNets that produce high-quality heatmaps. The proposed
solution is applied to diabetic retinopathy (DR) screening in a dataset of
almost 90,000 fundus photographs from the 2015 Kaggle Diabetic Retinopathy
competition and a private dataset of almost 110,000 photographs (e-ophtha). For
the task of detecting referable DR, very good detection performance was
achieved: $A_z = 0.954$ in Kaggle's dataset and $A_z = 0.949$ in e-ophtha.
Performance was also evaluated at the image level and at the lesion level in
the DiaretDB1 dataset, where four types of lesions are manually segmented:
microaneurysms, hemorrhages, exudates and cotton-wool spots. The proposed
detector outperforms recent algorithms trained to detect those lesions
specifically, as well as competing heatmap generation algorithms for ConvNets.
This detector is part of the Messidor system for mobile eye pathology
screening. Because it does not rely on expert knowledge or manual segmentation
for detecting relevant patterns, the proposed solution is a promising image
mining tool, which has the potential to discover new biomarkers in images.

people's interests from their actions. Yet their collective actions also allow
us to learn something about the world, in particular, infer attributes of
places people visit or interact with. Imagine classifying whether a hotel has a
gym or a swimming pool, or whether a restaurant has a romantic atmosphere
without ever asking its patrons. Algorithms we present can do just that.
  Many web applications rely on knowing attributes of places, for instance,
whether a particular restaurant has WiFi or offers outdoor seating. Such data
can be used to support a range of user experiences, from explicit query-driven
search to personalized place recommendations. However, obtaining these
attributes is generally difficult, with existing approaches relying on
crowdsourcing or parsing online reviews, both of which are noisy, biased, and
have limited coverage. Here we present a novel approach to classifying place
attributes, which learns from patrons' visit patterns based on anonymous
observational data.
  Our method, STEPS, learns from aggregated sequences of place visits. For
example, if many people visit the restaurant on a Saturday evening, coming from
a luxury hotel or theater, and stay for a long time, then this restaurant is
more likely to have a romantic atmosphere. On the other hand, if most people
visit the restaurant on weekdays, coming from work or a grocery store, then the
restaurant is less likely to be romantic. We show that such transition features
are highly predictive of place attributes. In an extensive empirical
evaluation, STEPS nearly doubled the coverage of a state of the art approach
thanks to learning from observational location data, which allowed our method
to reason about many more places.

identification. Our approach employs two types of extractors: one based on
rules, and another consisting of a statistical classifier. To compare our
approach, we use two baselines: a na\""ive baseline and another baseline based
on work in sentiment target identification. We perform our experiments on book
snippets and tweets, and show that our hybrid approach performs better than the
two baselines and also, in comparison with using the two extractors
individually. Our introductory approach establishes the viability of sarcasm
target identification, and will serve as a baseline for future work.

such that changing any single variable reduces the number of satisfied clauses.
We consider the question of the number of local maxima that an instance of
MAX-2-SAT can have. We give upper bounds in both the sparse and nonsparse case,
where the sparse case means that there is a bound $d$ on the average number of
clauses involving any given variable. The bounds in the nonsparse case are
tight up to polylogarithmic factors, while in the sparse case the bounds are
tight up to a multiplicative factor in $d$ for large $d$. Additionally, we
generalize to the question of assignments which are maxima up to changing $k>
1$ variables simultaneously; in this case, we give explicit constructions with
large (in a sense explained below) numbers of such maxima in the sparse case.
The basic idea of the upper bound proof is to consider a random assignment to
some subset of the variables and determine the probability that some fraction
of the remaining variables can be fixed without considering interactions
between them. The bounded results hold in the case of weighted MAX-2-SAT as
well. Using this technique and combining with ideas from Ref. 6, we find an
algorithm for weighted MAX-2-SAT which is faster for large $d$ than previous
algorithms which use polynomial space; this algorithm does require an
additional bounds on maximum weights and degree.

of soft composite solids, where it is found to significantly affect the
mechanical properties, such as the elastic response to an external stress. It
has recently been discovered that Eshelby's inclusion theory breaks down when
the inclusion size approaches the elastocapillary length $L\equiv\gamma/E$,
where $\gamma$ is the inclusion/host surface tension and $E$ is the host
Young's modulus. Extending our recent results for liquid inclusions, here we
model the elastic behavior of a non-dilute distribution of isotropic elastic
spherical inclusions in a soft isotropic elastic matrix, subject to a
prescribed infinitesimal far-field loading. Within our framework, the composite
stiffness is uniquely determined by the elastocapillary length $L$, the
spherical inclusion radius $R$, and the stiffness contrast parameter ${C}$,
which is the ratio of the inclusion to the matrix stiffness. We compare the
results with those from the case of liquid inclusions, and we derive an
analytical expression for elastic cloaking of the composite by the inclusions.
Remarkably, we find that the composite stiffness is influenced significantly by
surface tension even for inclusions two orders of magnitude more stiff than the
host matrix. Finally, we show how to simultaneously determine the surface
tension and the inclusion stiffness using two independent constraints provided
by global and local measurements.

developed in combination with the double-distribution-function (DDF) approach.
A density distribution function relaxed by the cascaded scheme is employed to
solve the flow field, and a total energy distribution function relaxed by the
BGK scheme is used to solve temperature field, where two distribution functions
are coupled naturally. The forcing terms are incorporated by means of central
moments, which is consistent with the previous force scheme [Premnath \emph{et
al.}, Phys. Rev. E \textbf{80}, 036702 (2009)] but the derivation is more
intelligible and the evolution process is simpler. In the method, the viscous
heat dissipation and compression work are taken into account, the Prandtl
number and specific-heat ratio are adjustable, the external force is considered
directly without the Boussinesq assumption, and the low-Mach number
compressible flows can also be simulated. The forcing scheme is tested by
simulating a steady Taylor-Green flow, and the new TCLBM is then tested by
numerical experiments of the thermal Couette flow, low-Mach number shock tube
problem, and Rayleigh-B\'{e}nard convection. The simulation results agree well
with the analytical solutions and/or results given by previous researchers.

complex and non-decomposable performance metrics such as the F-measure and the
Jaccard measure. The proposed framework is general, as it applies to both batch
and online learning, and to both linear and non-linear models. Our work follows
recent results showing that the Bayes optimal classifier for many complex
metrics is given by a thresholding of the conditional probability of the
positive class. This manuscript extends this thresholding characterization --
showing that the utility is strictly locally quasi-concave with respect to the
threshold for a wide range of models and performance metrics. This, in turn,
motivates simple normalized gradient ascent updates for threshold estimation.
We present a finite-sample regret analysis for the resulting procedure. In
particular, the risk for the batch case converges to the Bayes risk at the same
rate as that of the underlying conditional probability estimation, and the risk
of proposed online algorithm converges at a rate that depends on the
conditional probability estimation risk. For instance, in the special case
where the conditional probability model is logistic regression, our procedure
achieves $O(\frac{1}{\sqrt{n}})$ sample complexity, both for batch and online
training. Empirical evaluation shows that the proposed algorithms out-perform
alternatives in practice, with comparable or better prediction performance and
reduced run time for various metrics and datasets.

Different from traditional unfolding based tensor norm, this low-rank tensor
constraint has optimality properties similar to that of matrix rank derived
from SVD, so the complementary information among views can be explored more
efficiently and thoroughly. The established model, called t-SVD based
Multi-view Subspace Clustering (t-SVD-MSC), falls into the applicable scope of

be controlled externally by various parameters, such as pressure, atomic
compositions and external field. Sometimes, the gap even collapses by tuning
some parameter. In the field of topological insulators, such closing of the gap
at a time-reversal invariant momentum indicates a band inversion, i.e. it leads
to a topological phase transition from a normal insulator to a topological

universal, in the sense that the gap closing always leads either to a Weyl
semimetal or a nodal-line semimetal, from an exhaustive study on possible space
groups. We here consider three-dimensional spinful systems with time-reversal

Kozlov","The first Cheeger constant of a simplex","18 pages, 3 figures, to appear in Graphs and Combinatorics",,,,"math.AT math.CO","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The coboundary expansion generalizes the classical graph expansion to the
case of the general simplicial complexes, and allows the definition of the
higher-dimensional Cheeger constants $h_k(X)$ for an arbitrary simplicial
complex $X$, and any $k\geq 0$. In this paper we investigate the value of
$h_1(\Delta^{[n]})$ - the first Cheeger constant of a simplex with $n$
vertices. It is known, due to the pioneering work of Meshulam and Wallach, that
\[\lceil n/3\rceil\geq h_1(\Delta^{[n]})\geq n/3, \textrm{ for all } n,\] and
that the equality $h_1(\Delta^{[n]})=n/3$ is achieved when $n$ is divisible by
$3$.
  Here we expand on these results. First, we show that \[h_1(\Delta^{[n]})=n/3,
\textrm{ whenever }n\textrm{ is not a power of }2.\] So the sharp equality
holds on a set whose density goes to $1$. Second, we show that
\[h_1(\Delta^{[n]})=n/3+O(1/n),\textrm{ when }n\textrm{ is a power of }2.\] In
other words, as $n$ goes to infinity, the value $h_1(\Delta^{[n]})-n/3$ is
either $0$ or goes to $0$ very rapidly.
  Our methods include recasting the original question in purely graph-theoretic
language, followed by a detailed investigation of a specific graph family, the
so-called {\it staircase graphs}. These are defined by associating a graph to
every partition, and appear to be especially suited to gain information about
the first Cheeger constant of a simplex.

called bosonic-seesaw portal (BSP) scenario. The BS provides the dynamical
origin of the electroweak symmetry breaking, triggered by mixing between the
elementary Higgs and a composite Higgs generated by a new-color strong
dynamics, hypercolor (HC). At the HC strong coupling scale, the classical-scale
invariance assumed in the model is dynamically broken as well as the ""chiral""
symmetry present in the HC sector. In addition to the composite Higgs, HC
baryons emerge to potentially be stable because of the unbroken HC baryon
number symmetry. Hence the lightest HC baryon can be a DM candidate. Of
interest in the present scenario is that HC pions can be as heavy as the HC
baryon due to the possibly enhanced-explicit ""chiral""-breaking effect triggered
after the BS mechanism, so the HC baryon pair cannot annihilate into HC pions.
As in the standard setup of freeze-in scenario, it is assumed that the DM was
never in the thermal equilibrium, which ends up with no thermal abundance. It
is then the non-thermal BSP process that crucially comes into the game below
the HC scale: the HC baryon significantly couples to the standard-model Higgs
via the BS mechanism, and can non-thermally be produced from the thermal plasma
below the HC scale, which turns out to allow the TeV mass scale for the
composite baryonic DM, much smaller than the generic bound placed in the
conventional thermal freeze-out scenario, to account for the observed relic
abundance. Thus the DM can closely be related to the mechanism of the
electroweak symmetry breaking.

$\lambda$1038 line photons and compute the flux ratio $F(6825)/F(7082)$ of
these Raman scattered \ion{O}{6} features formed in neutral regions with a
simple geometric shape as a function of \ion{H}{1} column density $N_{HI}$. In

inside, the flux ratio $F(6825)/F(7082)$ shows an overall decrease from 3 to 1
as $N_{HI}$ increases in the range $10^{22-24}{\rm\ cm^{-2}}$. In the cases of
a slab geometry and other geometries with the \ion{O}{6} source outside the
\ion{H}{1} region, Rayleigh escape operates to lower the flux ratio
considerably. For moderate values of $N_{HI}\sim 10^{23}{\rm\ cm^{-2}}$ the
flux ratio behaves in a complicated way to exhibit a broad bump with a peak
value of 3.5 in the case of a sphere geometry. We find that the ratio of Raman

around the Fermi level to be an oxide WSM. The structural symmetry broken phase
transition induces a topological phase transition. The coexistence of
ferroelectricity and Weyl nodes in HgPbO$_3$ is an ideal platform for exploring
multiphase interaction and mutual control. The Weyl nodes can be tuned by
external pulse electric field, which is promising for potential applications of

now under construction. It is feasible to build a balloon filled with enriched
xenon gas (with $^{136}$Xe up to 80\%) dissolved in LS, inserted into the
central region of the JUNO LS. The energy resolution is $\sim$1.9\% at the
$Q$-value of $^{136}$Xe 0$\nu\beta\beta$ decay. Ultra-low background is the key
for 0$\nu\beta\beta$ decay searches. Detailed studies of background rates from
intrinsic 2$\nu\beta\beta$ and $^{8}$B solar neutrinos, natural radioactivity,

transient mechanical properties and incorporation of them into polymeric
matrices is a route to enhance their mechanical stability. The aim of this work

poly(epsilon-caprolactone) (PCL) fibrous webs via one-step electrospinning,
aiming to establish the underlying relationships between spinning process,
molecular peptide conformation, and material internal architecture.
Electrospinning of PCL solutions (6% w/w) in hexafluoro-2-propanol (HFIP)
containing up to 40 mg/ml P11-8 resulted in the formation of fibres in both
nano- (10-100 nm) and submicron range (100-700 nm), in contrast to PCL only
webs, which displayed a predominantly submicron fibre distribution. FTIR and CD
spectroscopy on both PCL/peptide solutions and resulting electrospun webs
revealed monomeric and beta-sheet secondary conformation, respectively,
suggesting the occurrence of peptide self-assembly during electrospinning due
to solvent evaporation. The peptide concentration (0 -> 40 mg/ml) was found to
primarily affect the internal structure of the fabric at the nano-scale, whilst
water as well as cell culture medium contact angles were dramatically
decreased. Nearly no cytotoxic response (> 90% cell viability) was observed
when L929 mouse fibroblasts were cultured in contact with electrospun peptide

  Energy Functional",,,,,"math.NA","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Among numerical methods for partial differential equations arising from
steepest descent dynamics of energy functionals (e.g., Allen-Cahn and
Cahn-Hilliard equations), the convex splitting method is well-known to maintain
unconditional energy stability for a large time step size. In this work, we
show how to use the convex splitting idea to find transition states, i.e.,
index-1 saddle points of the same energy functionals. Based on the iterative
minimization formulation (IMF) for saddle points (SIAM J. Numer. Anal., vol.
53, p1786, 2015), we introduce the convex splitting method to minimize the
auxiliary functional at each cycle of the IMF. We present a general principle
of constructing convex splitting forms for these auxiliary functionals and show
how to avoid solving nonlinear equations. The new numerical scheme based on the
convex splitting method allows for large time step sizes. The new methods are
tested for the one dimensional Ginzburg-Landau energy functional in the search
of the Allen-Cahn or Cahn-Hilliard types of transition states. We provide the
numerical results of transition states for the two dimensional
Landau-Brazovskii energy functional for diblock copolymers.

are positioned such that, within the former's half-life time, they exchange a

indicate in 50% of the cases that no photon was exchanged. Yet other
measurements would reveal that, by the mere possibility of exchange, the two
atoms have become entangled. Consequently, the ""no exchange"" result, apparently
precluding entanglement, is non-locally established between the atoms by this
very entanglement. This quantum-mechanical version of the ancient Liar Paradox
can be realized with already existing transmission schemes, with the addition
of Bell's theorem applied to the no-exchange cases. Under appropriate
probabilities, the initially-excited atom, still excited, can be entangled with
additional atoms time and again, or alternatively, exert multipartite nonlocal
correlations in an interaction free manner. When densely repeated several
times, this result also gives rise to the Quantum Zeno effect, again exerted
between distant atoms without photon exchange. We discuss these experiments as
variants of Interaction-Free-Measurement, now generalized for both spatial and
temporal uncertainties. We next employ weak measurements for elucidating the
paradox. Interpretational issues are discussed in the conclusion, and a

GeV, 100 km circumference with two interaction points (IPs) per ring,
horizontal crossing angle of 30 mrad at the IP and the crab-waist scheme [1]
with local chromaticity correction. The crab-waist scheme is implemented within
the local chromaticity correction system without additional sextupoles, by
reducing the strength of one of the two sextupoles for vertical chromatic
correction at each side of the IP. So-called ""tapering"" of the magnets is
applied, which scales all fields of the magnets according to the local beam
energy to compensate for the effect of synchrotron radiation (SR) loss along
the ring. An asymmetric layout near the interaction region reduces the critical
energy of SR photons on the incoming side of the IP to values below 100 keV,
while matching the geometry to the beam line of the FCC proton collider
(FCC-hh) [2] as closely as possible. Sufficient transverse/longitudinal dynamic
aperture (DA) has been obtained, including major dynamical effects, to assure
an adequate beam lifetime in the presence of beamstrahlung and top-up
injection. In particular, a momentum acceptance larger than +/-2% has been
obtained, which is better than the momentum acceptance of typical collider
rings by about a factor of 2. The effects of the detector solenoids including
their compensation elements are taken into account as well as synchrotron
radiation in all magnets. The optics presented in this paper is a step toward a
full conceptual design for the collider. A number of issues have been
identified for further study.

by presenting a special multi-valued partial CFL function as an example
function and by proving that no refinement of this particular function becomes
a single-valued partial CFL function. This contrasts an early result of
Kobayashi [Inform. Control 15 (1969) 95-109] that multi-valued partial NFA
functions are always refined by single-valued NFA functions, where NFA
functions are computed by one-way nondeterministic finite automata with output
tapes. Our example function turns out to be unambiguously 2-valued, and thus we
obtain a stronger separation result, in which no refinement of unambiguously
2-valued partial CFL functions can be single-valued. For the proof of this
fact, we first introduce a new concept of colored automata having no output
tapes but having ""colors,"" which can simulate pushdown automata equipped with
constant-space output tapes. We then conduct an extensive combinatorial
analysis on the behaviors of transition records of stack contents (called stack
histories) of these colored automata.

present in pulse-coupled heterogeneous inhibitory networks: inhibition can
induce not only suppression of the neural activity, as expected, but it can
also promote neural reactivation. In particular, for globally coupled systems,
the number of firing neurons monotonically reduces upon increasing the strength
of inhibition (neurons' death). However, the random pruning of the connections
is able to reverse the action of inhibition, i.e. in a sparse network a
sufficiently strong synaptic strength can surprisingly promote, rather than
depress, the activity of the neurons (neurons' rebirth). Thus the number of
firing neurons reveals a minimum at some intermediate synaptic strength. We
show that this minimum signals a transition from a regime dominated by the
neurons with higher firing activity to a phase where all neurons are
effectively sub-threshold and their irregular firing is driven by current
fluctuations. We explain the origin of the transition by deriving an analytic
mean field formulation of the problem able to provide the fraction of active
neurons as well as the first two moments of their firing statistics. The
introduction of a synaptic time scale does not modify the main aspects of the
reported phenomenon. However, for sufficiently slow synapses the transition
becomes dramatic, the system passes from a perfectly regular evolution to an
irregular bursting dynamics. In this latter regime the model provides
predictions consistent with experimental findings for a specific class of
neurons, namely the medium spiny neurons in the striatum.

machine learning methods are being put under the microscope in order to

consider a basic algorithmic task that is central in machine learning:
subsampling from a large data set. Subsamples are used both as an end-goal in
data summarization (where fairness could either be a legal, political or moral
requirement) and to train algorithms (where biases in the samples are often a
source of bias in the resulting model). Consequently, there is a growing effort
to modify either the subsampling methods or the algorithms themselves in order

overlooked is whether it is possible to produce fair subsamples that are also
adequately representative of the feature space of the data set - an important
and classic requirement in machine learning. Can diversity and fairness be
simultaneously ensured? We start by noting that, in some applications,
guaranteeing one does not necessarily guarantee the other, and a new approach
is required. Subsequently, we present an algorithmic framework which allows us
to produce both fair and diverse samples. Our experimental results on an image
summarization task show marked improvements in fairness without compromising
feature diversity by much, giving us the best of both the worlds.

in bidirectional streams. A mock-up corridor monitored using a camera placed on
azimuthal position is used to study pedestrians' behavior in unidirectional and
bidirectional flows. Additionally, a commercial tablet is fixed on the chest of
sample pedestrians to examine their body rotation (or yawing) which cannot be
obtained using position tracking alone. Angular velocity is recorded and
simultaneously stored in a central location using a wireless network, thus
allowing the analysis of body movements with a high sampling rate and a limited
delay. To investigate the influence of major/minor flow proportion (flow-ratio)
on bidirectional streams two different situations were tested: the balanced
configuration (with equal flows in both directions) and an unbalanced
configuration (with different major and minor flow). Results clearly show that
unidirectional flow is more stable compared to the bidirectional case,
requiring less time to cross the experimental section and showing a very small
amount of rotation during the whole experiment. Both bidirectional
configurations showed high values of body rotation, in particular during lane
formation and dissolution. Finally, rotation directly measured on pedestrians'
body was compared with the one obtained indirectly by analyzing pedestrians'
trajectories. The comparison shows that, at least from a qualitative point of
view, both methods are in agreement, thus suggesting that even properties which
can only be measured by motion sensing could be obtained indirectly through the
analysis of trajectories. Concluding, it has been suggested that while lanes
help smooth out bidirectional flows, larger instabilities are observed compared
to the unidirectional case. Lane separation and/or appropriate guidance are
therefore required.

zone model that takes into account the changes in temperature and density
evolution caused by changes in the nuclear physics. Two types of bursts are
investigated - a typical mixed H/He burst with a limited rp-process and an
extreme mixed H/He burst with an extended rp-process. When allowing for a
3$\sigma$ variation only three remaining nuclear mass uncertainties affect the
light curve predictions of a typical H/He burst ($^{27}$P, $^{61}$Ga, and
$^{65}$As), and only three additional masses affect the composition strongly
($^{80}$Zr, $^{81}$Zr, and $^{82}$Nb). A larger number of mass uncertainties
remains to be addressed for the extreme H/He burst with the most important

characterized well by the dispersion of elastic modulus) is the internal factor
of dispersions of fatigue properties and the dispersion of the load is the
external factor. In this paper, according to theoretical derivation and
preliminary experiments verification, the following relationships between
dispersions of fatigue properties and dispersions of static mechanical
properties of a material are obtained: the dispersion of fatigue life is n (the
fatigue index) times of the sum of the dispersion of elastic modulus and the
dispersion of the load. The corresponding dispersion of fatigue life is a
decreasing function of the given fatigue strength in the stage of high cycle
fatigue; P-S curve (the probability statistical distribution of fatigue
strength) under the given fatigue life cannot be directly by test, but P-S
curve can be obtained on the bias of P-N curve (the probability statistical
distribution of fatigue life), and the corresponding dispersion of fatigue
strength is a decreasing function of the given fatigue life. On bias of
conclusions above, not only the inhomogeneity of material but also the
dispersion of the load needs to be considered in the fatigue design, especially

non linear equations is achieved by using preknowledge in the intensity as
obtained by a conventional image detetctor. The resulting linear equations are
not based on any approximation, iterative perturbation expansion etc. but are
exact. The method is non iterative and stable against noise for arbitrarily
chosen test fields. Allowed fields can exhibit highly fluctuating
amplitudes/phases on the pixel scale, areas of vanishing amplitude and Pi phase
jumps. The spatial resolution is of pixel size. No reference beam and no
diaphragms are used. The new method can be implemented as a fast, one shot per
frame video system. An outlook on the space resolved measurement of non
classical two photon states (including vacuum squeezed coherent states) is
given.

  Strength","15 pages, 4 figures",,"10.1016/j.aop.2017.03.008",,"quant-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Acquiring information about an unknown qubit in a superposition of two states
is essential in any computation process. Quantum measurement, or sharp
measurement, is usually used to read the information contents of that unknown
qubit system. Quantum measurement is an irreversible operation that makes the
superposition collapses to one of the two possible states in a probabilistic
way. In this paper, a quantum algorithm will be proposed to read the
information in an unknown qubit without applying sharp measurement on that
qubit. The proposed algorithm will use a quantum feedback control scheme by
applying sharp measurement iteratively on an auxiliary qubit weakly entangled
with the unknown qubit. The information contents of the unknown qubit can be
read by counting the outcomes from the sharp measurement on the auxiliary
qubit. Iterative measurements on the auxiliary qubit will make the amplitudes
of the superposition move in a random walk manner where a weak measurement is
applied on the unknown qubit which can be reversed when the random walk takes
opposite steps to decrease the disturbance introduced to the system. The
proposed algorithm will define the strength of the weak measurement so that it
can be controlled by adding an arbitrary number of dummy qubits $\mu$ to the
system. This will make the measurement process slowdown to an arbitrary scale
so that the effect of the sharp measurement on the unknown qubit is reached
after $O(\mu^2)$ measurements on the auxiliary qubit.

singularity and produces the world with all it's objects and dimensions from
nothing. We name this theory as G-theory. In this model, first, two types of
energies with opposite signs are produced from nothing such as the sum over
them be zero. They create two types of branes with opposite quantum numbers
which interact with each other by exchanging bosonic tensor fields like
graviton and compact. By compacting branes, fermionic tensor fields are emerged
which some of them play the role of the gravitinos. Also, some dimensions take
extra (i) factors, their properties become different and they behave like time
dimensions. Gravitons and gravitinos create two types of wormholes which lead
to the oscillation of branes between expansion and contracting branches. These
wormholes produce a repulsive gravity in compacted branes and cause that their
particles get away from each other and expansion branch begin. Also, they
create an attractive gravity in opening branes and lead to closing their
particles and starting the contraction epoch. Our universe is born on one of
these branes and oscillates between contraction and expansion branch.

spectral distribution of the free Jacobi process associated with a single
projection. Actually, we notice that the flow solves a radial L\""owner equation
and as such, the general theory of L\""owner equations implies that it is
univalent in some connected region in the open unit disc. We also prove that
its inverse defines the Aleksandrov-Clark measure at $z=1$ of some Herglotz
function which is absolutely-continuous with an essentially bounded density. As
a by-product, we deduce that $z=1$ belongs only to the discrete spectrum of the
unitary operator whose spectral dynamics are governed by the flow. Moreover, we
use a previous result due to the first author in order to derive an explicit,
yet complicated, expression of the moments of both the unitary and the free
Jacobi processes. The paper is closed with some remarks on the boundary
behavior of the flow's inverse.

present a reconstruction algorithm that uses a nearly optimal number of
phaseless time-frequency structured measurements and discuss its robustness in
the case when the measurements are corrupted by noise. We show how geometric
properties of the measurement frame are related to the robustness of the
phaseless reconstruction. The presented algorithm is based on the idea of
polarization as proposed by Alexeev, Bandeira, Fickus, and Mixon.
