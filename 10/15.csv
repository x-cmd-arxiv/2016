system is a subsystem of a single Nitrogen-Vacancy center coupled to a
first-shell $^{13}$C nuclear spin in diamond at a level anti-crossing point

due to the $^{13}$C hyperfine interaction. The transition frequency of this
electron spin two-level system in a static magnetic field of 28.9 G is 1.7 MHz
and it can be driven only by the $z$-component of the RF field. Electron spin
Rabi frequencies in this system can reach tens of MHz even for moderate RF
powers. The simple sinusoidal Rabi oscillations that occur when the amplitude
of the driving field is much smaller than the transition frequency become
complex when the driving field strength is comparable or greater than the

amplitude of the driving field and the response of the system shows multiple
frequencies.

two critical issues in mapping requests to servers in Content Delivery Networks

been yet quantitatively investigated in designing efficient request mapping
schemes. In this work, we formalize this trade-off through a stochastic
optimization problem. While the solutions to the problem in the extreme cases
of minimum communication cost and optimum load balancing can be derived in
closed form, finding the general solution is hard to derive. Thus we propose
three heuristic mapping schemes and compare the trade-off performance of them
through extensive simulations.
  Our simulation results show that at the expense of high query cost, we can
achieve a good trade-off curve. Moreover, by benefiting from the power of
multiple choices phenomenon, we can achieve almost the same performance with
much less query cost. Finally, we can handle requests with different delay
requirements at the cost of degrading network performance.

differentiability of this function with respect to both primal and dual

exoplanet spectral characterization missions, but past research on habitability
assessment has largely ignored the vastly different conditions that have
existed in our planet's long habitable history. This study presents simulations
of a habitable yet dramatically different phase of Earth's history, when the
atmosphere contained a Titan-like organic-rich haze. Prior work has claimed a
haze-rich Archean Earth (3.8-2.5 billion years ago) would be frozen due to the
haze's cooling effects. However, no previous studies have self-consistently
taken into account climate, photochemistry, and fractal hazes. Here, we
demonstrate using coupled climate-photochemical-microphysical simulations that
hazes can cool the planet's surface by about 20 K, but habitable conditions
with liquid surface water could be maintained with a relatively thick haze
layer (tau ~ 5 at 200 nm) even with the fainter young sun. We find that
optically thicker hazes are self-limiting due to their self-shielding
properties, preventing catastrophic cooling of the planet. Hazes may even
enhance planetary habitability through UV shielding, reducing surface UV flux
by about 97% compared to a haze-free planet, and potentially allowing survival
of land-based organisms 2.6.2.7 billion years ago. The broad UV absorption
signature produced by this haze may be visible across interstellar distances,
allowing characterization of similar hazy exoplanets. The haze in Archean
Earth's atmosphere was strongly dependent on biologically-produced methane, and
we propose hydrocarbon haze may be a novel type of spectral biosignature on
planets with substantial levels of CO2. Hazy Archean Earth is the most alien
world for which we have geochemical constraints on environmental conditions,
providing a useful analog for similar habitable, anoxic exoplanets.

that NGC 5102 has the characteristic 2 sigma peaks indicative of galaxies with
counter-rotating discs. This interpretation is quantitatively confirmed by
fitting two kinematic components to the observed spectra. Through stellar
population analysis we confirm the known young stellar population in the centre

anisotropic models of the stellar dynamics to investigate the initial mass
function (IMF) and the dark matter halo of the galaxy. The models show that
this galaxy is quite different from all galaxies previously studied with a
similar approach: even within the half-light radius, it cannot be approximated
with the self-consistent mass-follows-light assumption. Including an NFW dark
matter halo, we need a heavy IMF and a dark matter fraction of 0.37+-0.04
within a sphere of one effective radius to describe the stellar kinematics. The
more general model with a free slope of the dark matter halo shows that slope
and IMF are degenerate, but indicates that a light weight IMF (Chabrier-like)
and a higher dark matter fraction, with a steeper (contracted) halo, fit the
data better. Regardless of the assumptions about the halo profile, we measure
the slope of the total mass density to be -1.75+-0.04. This is shallower than
the slope of -2 of an isothermal halo and shallower than published slopes for
more massive early type galaxies.

fundamental question: Why is self-organization taking place? We illustrate the
inherent key mechanistic aspects that lead to tube growth in various different
morphologies, such as rippled-walled tubes, smooth tubes, stacks and
bamboo-type tubes, and importantly the formation of double-walled TiO2
nanotubes versus single-walled tubes, and the drastic difference in their
physical and chemical properties. We show how both double- and single-walled
tube layers can be detached from the metallic substrate and exploited for the
preparation of robust self-standing membranes. Finally, we show how by
selecting the right growth approach to TiO2 nanotubes specific functional
features can be significantly improved, e.g., an enhanced electron mobility,
intrinsic doping, or crystallization into pure anatase at extremely high
temperatures can be achieved. This in turn can be exploited in constructing
high performance devices based on anodic TiO2 in a wide range of applications.

this new representation we show that our communication protocol does not only
counteract the inevitable photon loss during channel transmission, but is also
able to resist common experimental errors such as Pauli-type errors (bit- and

we demonstrate that on the physical level of photonic qubits the choice of the
standard linear optical Bell measurement with its limited efficiency is optimal
for our setting in the sense that, apart from their potential use in state
preparation, more advanced Bell measurements yield only a small decrease in
resource consumption. We devise two state generation schemes that provide the
required ancillary encoded Bell states (quasi-)on-demand at every station. The
schemes are either based on nonlinear optics or on linear optics with
multiplexing and exhibit resource costs that scale linearly or less than
quadratic with the number of photons per encoded qubit, respectively. Finally,

as bone and adipose tissue surrogate inserts. We successfully reconstructed a
3D image of the treatment beam in the phantom from single secondary ion tracks.
The beam image corresponds well to the distribution expected from the beam
direction and energy. In addition, cylindrical inhomogeneities with a diameter

simplicity entirely unexpected from Feynman diagrams, but also an underlying
structure remarkably reminiscent of worldsheet theory correlators. These
features can be explained by ambitwistor strings - two-dimensional chiral
conformal field theories in an auxiliary target space, the complexified phase
space of null geodesics. The aim of this thesis is to explore the ambitwistor
string approach to understand these structures in amplitudes, and thereby
provide a new angle on quantum field theories. The first part of the thesis
provides a user-friendly introduction to ambitwistor strings, as well as a
condensed overview over the literature and some novel results. Emphasising the
study of tree-level amplitudes, we then explore the wide-ranging impact of
ambitwistor strings for an extensive family of massless theories, and discuss
the duality between asymptotic symmetries and the low energy behaviour of a
theory from the point of view of the worldsheet CFT. The second part of this
thesis focusses on proving a conjectured ambitwistor string formula for loop
amplitudes, and extending the formalism to more general theories. Remarkably,
residue theorems reduce the computationally challenging ambitwistor
higher-genus expressions to simple formulae on nodal Riemann spheres. This idea
is developed into a widely applicable framework for loop integrands, that is
shown to be applicable to both supersymmetric and non-supersymmetric theories.
In the case of supergravity, this provides strong evidence for the validity of
the ambitwistor string at loop level, and explicit proofs are given for
non-supersymmetric theories. This leads to a proposal for an all-loop integrand
for gravity and Yang-Mills.

identity of the file retrieved at the database, which is known as the problem
of private information retrieval (PIR). If it is further required that the user
obtains no information about the database other than the desired file, the
concept of symmetric private information retrieval (SPIR) is introduced to
guarantee privacy for both parties. In this paper, the problem of SPIR is
studied for a database stored among $N$ nodes in a distributed way, by using an
$(N,M)$-MDS storage code. The information-theoretic capacity of SPIR, defined
as the maximum number of symbols of the desired file retrieved per downloaded
symbol, for the coded database is derived. It is shown that the SPIR capacity
for coded database is $1-\frac{M}{N}$, when the amount of the shared common
randomness of distributed nodes (unavailable at the user) is at least
$\frac{M}{N-M}$ times the file size. Otherwise, the SPIR capacity for the coded

that it provides comprehensive frameworks for simultaneous registration,
deformation, and comparison of shapes. These methods achieve computational
efficiency using certain square-root representations that transform invariant
elastic metrics into Euclidean metrics, allowing for applications of standard
algorithms and statistical tools. For analyzing shapes of embeddings of
$\mathbb{S}^2$ in $\mathbb{R}^3$, Jermyn et al. introduced square-root normal
fields (SRNFs) that transformed an elastic metric, with desirable invariant
properties, into the $\mathbb{L}^2$ metric. These SRNFs are essentially surface
normals scaled by square-roots of infinitesimal area elements. A critical need
in shape analysis is to invert solutions (deformations, averages, modes of
variations, etc) computed in the SRNF space, back to the original surface space
for visualizations and inferences. Due to the lack of theory for understanding
SRNFs maps and their inverses, we take a numerical approach and derive an
efficient multiresolution algorithm, based on solving an optimization problem
in the surface space, that estimates surfaces corresponding to given SRNFs.
This solution is found effective, even for complex shapes, e.g. human bodies
and animals, that undergo significant deformations including bending and
stretching. Specifically, we use this inversion for computing elastic shape
deformations, transferring deformations, summarizing shapes, and for finding
modes of variability in a given collection, while simultaneously registering
the surfaces. We demonstrate the proposed algorithms using a statistical
analysis of human body shapes, classification of generic surfaces and analysis
of brain structures.

moment matrix positivity. We identify that incompatibility of measurements is
only necessary, but not sufficient, in general, for the violation of the

the degree of incompatibility (which quantifies the joint measurability) of the
equatorial qubit observables and the optimal violation of a non-local steering
inequality, proposed by Jones and Wiseman (Phys. Rev. A, 84, 012110 (2011)). To

problems and solved independently. However, in this paper, we argue that
tracking and segmentation are actually closely related and solving one should
help the other. On one hand, the object track, which is a set of bounding boxes
with one bounding box in every frame, would provide strong high-level guidance
for the target/background segmentation task. On the other hand, the object
segmentation would separate object from other objects and background, which
will be useful for determining track locations in every frame. We propose a
novel framework which combines online multiple target tracking and segmentation
in a video. In our approach, the tracking and segmentation problems are coupled
by Lagrange dual decomposition, which leads to more accurate segmentation
results and also \emph{helps resolve typical difficulties in multiple target
tracking, such as occlusion handling, ID-switch and track drifting}. To track
targets, an individual appearance model is learned for each target via
structured learning and network flow is employed to generate tracks from
densely sampled candidates. For segmentation, multi-label Conditional Random
Field (CRF) is applied to a superpixel based spatio-temporal graph in a segment
of video to assign background or target labels to every superpixel. The
experiments on diverse sequences show that our method outperforms
state-of-the-art approaches for multiple target tracking as well as
segmentation.

reflection at the sample boundaries plays a key role in the scaling of
transmission. Here we consider the impact of surface reflection on the
propagation of diffusive waves in terms of the modification of the distribution
of transmission eigenvalues (DTE). We review our finding of a transition in the
analytical form of the DTE at the point that the sample length equals
$|z_b-z_b'|$. The highest transmission eigenvalue for stronger asymmetry in
boundary reflection is strictly smaller than unity. The average transmission
and profiles of energy density inside the sample can still be described in
terms of the sample length, $L$, and the boundary extrapolation lengths on both
sides of the sample, $z_b, z_b'$. For localized waves, we find the energy
density profile within the sample is a segment of the distribution that would
be found in a longer sample with length $L+z_b+z_b'$. These results suggest new

combination of sounds and has been approached quantitatively using mathematical
relations, physics, information theory, and psychoacoustics. Tonal consonance
is present in timbre, musical tuning, harmony, and melody, and it is used for
conveying sensations, perceptions, and emotions in music. It involves the
physical properties of sound waves and is used to study melody and harmony
through musical intervals and chords. From the perspective of complexity, the
macroscopic properties of a system with many parts frequently rely on the
statistical properties of its constituent elements. Here we show how the tonal
consonance parameters for complex tones can be used to study complexity in
music. We apply this formalism to melody, showing that melodic lines in musical
pieces can be described in terms of the physical properties of melodic
intervals and the existence of an entropy extremalization principle subject to
psychoacoustic macroscopic constraints with musical meaning. This result
connects the human perception of consonance with the complexity of human
creativity in music through the physical properties of the musical stimulus.

the interaction between the particles and the self-generated turbulence by

We analyze the anomalous transport properties by using 2.5D Particle-in-Cell
(PiC) code simulations. We split off the mean, slow variation (in contrast to
the fast turbulent fluctuations) of the macroscopic observables and determine
the main transport terms of the generalized Ohm's law. We verify our findings
by comparing with the independently determined slowing-down rate of the
macroscopic currents and with the transport terms obtained by the first order
correlations of the turbulent fluctuations. We find that the turbulence is most
intense in the ""low density"" separatrix region of guide-field reconnection. It
is excited by streaming instabilities, it is mainly electrostatic, ""patchy"" in
space and so is the associated quasi-periodic anomalous transport. The
remaining irreversible anomalous resistivity can be parametrized by an
effective collision frequency ranging from the local ion-cyclotron to the
lower-hybrid frequency. The contributions to the parallel and the perpendicular
(to the magnetic field) components of the slowly varying, DC-electric fields,
balanced by the turbulence, are similar. This anomalous electric field is,
however, smaller than the contributions of the off-diagonal pressure and
electron inertia terms of the Ohm's law. This result can now be verified by
in-situ measurements of the turbulence, in and around the magnetic reconnection

Server depicts the cerebral connections of $n=418$ subjects with a
frequency-parameter $k$: For any $k=1,2,...,n$ one can view the graph of the
edges that are present in at least $k$ connectomes. If parameter $k$ is
decreased one-by-one from $k=n$ through $k=1$ then more and more edges appear
in the graph, since the inclusion condition is relaxed. The surprising
observation is that the appearance of the edges is far from random: it
resembles a growing, complex structure, like a tree or a shrub (visualized on

robustness of the CCD phenomenon, and we show that it is almost independent of
the particular choice of the set of underlying individual connectomes, yielding

reaching GeV energies and lasting several days challenge the standard models
for particle acceleration in pulsar wind nebulae, because the radiating
electrons have energies exceeding the classical radiation-reaction limit for
synchrotron. Previous modeling has suggested that the synchrotron limit can be
exceeded if the electrons experience electrostatic acceleration, but the
resulting spectra do not agree very well with the data. As a result, there are
still some important unanswered questions about the detailed particle
acceleration and emission processes occurring during the flares. We revisit the
problem using a new analytical approach based on an electron transport equation
that includes terms describing electrostatic acceleration, stochastic
wave-particle acceleration, shock acceleration, synchrotron losses, and
particle escape. An exact solution is obtained for the electron distribution,
which is used to compute the associated {\gamma}-ray synchrotron spectrum. We
find that in our model the {\gamma}-ray flares are mainly powered by
electrostatic acceleration, but the contributions from stochastic and shock
acceleration play an important role in producing the observed spectral shapes.
Our model can reproduce the spectra of all the Fermi-LAT and AGILE flares from
the Crab nebula, using magnetic field strengths in agreement with the
multi-wavelength observational constraints. We also compute the spectrum and
duration of the synchrotron afterglow created by the accelerated electrons,
after they escape into the region on the downstream side of the pulsar wind
termination shock. The afterglow is expected to fade over a maximum period of
about three weeks after the {\gamma}-ray flare.

recorded with cellular resolution in awake and behaving animals. Brain motion
in these recordings pose a unique challenge. The location of individual neurons
must be tracked in 3D over time to accurately extract single neuron activity
traces. Recordings from small invertebrates like C. elegans are especially
challenging because they undergo very large brain motion and deformation during
animal movement. Here we present an automated computer vision pipeline to
reliably track populations of neurons with single neuron resolution in the
brain of a freely moving C. elegans undergoing large motion and deformation. 3D
volumetric fluorescent images of the animal's brain are straightened, aligned
and registered, and the locations of neurons in the images are found via
segmentation. Each neuron is then assigned an identity using a new
time-independent machine-learning approach we call Neuron Registration Vector
Encoding. In this approach, non-rigid point-set registration is used to match
each segmented neuron in each volume with a set of reference volumes taken from
throughout the recording. The way each neuron matches with the references
defines a feature vector which is clustered to assign an identity to each
neuron in each volume. Finally, thin-plate spline interpolation is used to
correct errors in segmentation and check consistency of assigned identities.
The Neuron Registration Vector Encoding approach proposed here is uniquely well
suited for tracking neurons in brains undergoing large deformations. When
applied to whole-brain calcium imaging recordings in freely moving C. elegans,
this analysis pipeline located 150 neurons for the duration of an 8 minute
recording and consistently found more neurons more quickly than manual or
semi-automated approaches.

common but often undesirable assumption. In this paper, we study the following
two-sample testing problem: given two samples generated by two high-dimensional
linear models, we aim to test whether the regression coefficients of the two
linear models are identical. We propose a framework named TIERS (short for
TestIng Equality of Regression Slopes), which solves the two-sample testing
problem without making any assumptions on the sparsity of the regression
parameters. TIERS builds a new model by convolving the two samples in such a
way that the original hypothesis translates into a new moment condition. A
self-normalization construction is then developed to form a moment test. We
provide rigorous theory for the developed framework. Under very weak conditions
of the feature covariance, we show that the accuracy of the proposed test in
controlling Type I errors is robust both to the lack of sparsity in the
features and to the heavy tails in the error distribution, even when the sample
size is much smaller than the feature dimension. Moreover, we discuss minimax
optimality and efficiency properties of the proposed test. Simulation analysis
demonstrates excellent finite-sample performance of our test. In deriving the
test, we also develop tools that are of independent interest. The test is built
upon a novel estimator, called Auto-aDaptive Dantzig Selector (ADDS), which not
only automatically chooses an appropriate scale of the error term but also
incorporates prior information. To effectively approximate the critical value
of the test statistic, we develop a novel high-dimensional plug-in approach

approximate message passing (AMP), which has recently arisen as a central
technique for inference problems such as structured low-rank estimation and
compressed sensing. We augment the standard ideas of AMP with ideas from

compact groups. Using standard but non-rigorous methods from statistical
physics we analyze the behavior of our algorithm on a Gaussian noise model,
identifying phases where the problem is easy, (computationally) hard, and
(statistically) impossible. In particular, such evidence predicts that our
algorithm is information-theoretically optimal in many cases, and that the
remaining cases show evidence of statistical-to-computational gaps.

machine (DTM), for a fundamental problem at the core of many learning tasks:
choose a threshold for a given pre-specified level that bounds the tail
probability of the maximum of a (possibly dependent but stationary) random
sequence. We do not assume data distribution, but rather relying on the
asymptotic distribution of extremal values, and reduce the problem to estimate
three parameters of the extreme value distributions and the extremal index. We
specially take care of data dependence via estimating extremal index since in
many settings, such as scan statistics, change-point detection, and extreme
bandits, where dependence in the sequence of statistics can be significant. Key
features of our DTM also include robustness and the computational efficiency,
and it only requires one sample path to form a reliable estimate of the
threshold, in contrast to the Monte Carlo sampling approach which requires
drawing a large number of sample paths. We demonstrate the good performance of
DTM via numerical examples in various dependent settings.

Accordingly we develop a theory of \emph{outer-product-free} sets, where $S$ is
the set of real, symmetric matrices of the form $xx^T$. All maximal
outer-product-free sets of full dimension are shown to be convex cones and we
identify several families of such sets. These families are used to generate

nonzero curvature, evolving dark energy, modified gravity, and running of the

microwave background measurements from Planck. The discordance between the two
datasets is largely unaffected by a more conservative treatment of the lensing
systematics and the removal of angular scales most sensitive to nonlinear
physics. The only extended cosmology that simultaneously alleviates the
discordance with Planck and is at least moderately favored by the data includes
evolving dark energy with a time-dependent equation of state (in the form of
the $w_0-w_a$ parameterization). In this model, the respective $S_8 = \sigma_8
\sqrt{\Omega_{\rm m}/0.3}$ constraints agree at the $1\sigma$ level, and there
is `substantial concordance' between the KiDS and Planck datasets when
accounting for the full parameter space. Moreover, the Planck constraint on the
Hubble constant is wider than in LCDM and in agreement with the Riess et al.
(2016) direct measurement of $H_0$. The dark energy model is moderately favored
as compared to LCDM when combining the KiDS and Planck measurements, and
remains moderately favored after including an informative prior on the Hubble
constant. In both of these scenarios, marginalized constraints in the $w_0-w_a$
plane are discrepant with a cosmological constant at the $3\sigma$ level.
Moreover, KiDS constrains the sum of neutrino masses to 4.0 eV (95% CL), finds
no preference for time or scale dependent modifications to the metric
potentials, and is consistent with flatness and no running of the spectral
index. The analysis code is public at https://github.com/sjoudaki/kids450

modelled using a non-associative pressure dependent paraboloidal yield

transversely isotropic material model is used to model yarns/fibres within the
representative volume element (RVE). A unified approach is used to impose the
RVE boundary conditions, which allows convenient switching between linear

computational model is implemented within the framework of the hierarchic

Furthermore, the computational framework is designed to take advantage of

the computational framework are demonstrated with a variety of numerical
examples, including unidirectional FRP composite, a composite comprising a
multi-fibre and multi-layer RVE, with randomly generated fibres, and a single

group in the dark sector, decoupled from Standard Model forces. We find that
the strongest constraints in the literature are subject to a number of
mitigating factors. For instance, the naive dark matter thermalization
timescale in halos is corrected by saturation effects that slow down
isotropization for modest ellipticities. The weakened bounds uncover
interesting parameter space, making models with weak-scale charged dark matter
viable, even with electromagnetic strength interaction. This also leads to the
intriguing possibility that dark matter self-interactions within small dwarf
galaxies are extremely large, a relatively unexplored regime in current
simulations. Such strong interactions suppress heat transfer over scales larger
than the dark matter mean free path, inducing a dynamical cutoff length scale
above which the system appears to have only feeble interactions. These effects
must be taken into account to assess the viability of darkly-charged dark
matter. Future analyses and measurements should probe a promising region of
parameter space for this model.

restricted to first infall. In a companion paper we contrast the properties of
field and cluster galaxies, whereas here we correlate the properties of
H{\alpha} emitters to a number of tracers of the cluster environment to
investigate its role in driving galaxy transformations. H{\alpha} emitters are
found in the clusters out to 0.5 virial radii, the maximum radius covered by
GLASS. The peak of the H{\alpha} emission is offset with respect to the peak of
the UV-continuum. We decompose this offsets into a radial and tangential
component. The radial compo- nent points away from the cluster center in 60% of
the cases, with 95% confidence. The decompositions agree with cosmological
simulations, i.e. the H{\alpha} emission offset correlates with galaxy velocity
and ram-pressure stripping signatures. Trends between H{\alpha} emitter
properties and surface mass density distributions and X-ray emissions emerge
only for unrelaxed clusters. The lack of strong correlations with the global
environment does not allow us to identify a unique environmental effect
originating from the cluster center. In contrast, correla- tions between
H{\alpha} morphology and local number density emerge. We conclude that local
effects, uncorrelated to the cluster-centric radius, play a more important role
in shaping galaxy properties.

their gravitating mass at both large and small radii to develop a method for
determining mass profiles that span a wide radial range and extend down into
the central galaxy. We also consider potential observational pitfalls in
understanding cooling in hot cluster atmospheres, and find tentative evidence
for a relationship between the radial extent of cooling X-ray gas and nebular
H-alpha emission in cool core clusters. Amongst this small sample we find no
support for the existence of a central 'entropy floor', with the entropy
profiles following a power-law profile down to our resolution limit.

point to a Fermi liquid like state, while still allowing an exact solution in a
suitable large $N$ limit. The extended model involves coupling the interacting
$N$-site SYK model to a new set of $pN$ peripheral sites with only quadratic
hopping terms between them. The conformal fixed point of the SYK model remains
a stable low energy phase below a critical ratio of peripheral sites $p<p_c(n)$
that depends on the fermion filling $n$. The scrambling dynamics throughout the
non-Fermi liquid phase is characterized by a universal Lyapunov exponent
$\lambda_L\to 2\pi T$ in the low temperature limit, however the temperature
scale marking the crossover to the conformal regime vanishes continuously at
the critical point $p_c$. The residual entropy at $T\to 0$, non zero in the
NFL, also vanishes continuously at the critical point. For $p>p_c$ the
quadratic sites effectively screen the SYK dynamics, leading to a quadratic
fixed point in the low temperature and frequency limit. The interactions have a
perturbative effect in this regime leading to scrambling with Lyapunov exponent
$\lambda_L\propto T^2$.

(10^8-10^11 M_sun) and star formation rate (0.5-50 M_sun/yr). We visually
classify galaxies in terms of broad-band morphology, Halpha morphology and
likely physical process acting on the galaxy. Most Halpha emitters have a
spiral morphology (41+/-8% in clusters, 51+/-8% in the field), followed by
mergers/interactions (28+/-8%, 31+/-7%, respectively) and early-type galaxies
(remarkably as high as 29+/-8% in clusters and 15+/-6% in the field). A
diversity of Halpha morphologies is detected, suggesting a diversity of
physical processes. In clusters, 30+/-8% of the galaxies present a regular
morphology, mostly consistent with star formation diffused uniformly across the
stellar population (mostly in the disk component, when present). The second
most common morphology (28+/-8%) is asymmetric/jellyfish, consistent with ram
pressure stripping or other non-gravitational processes in 18+/-8% of the
cases. Ram pressure stripping appears significantly less prominent in the field
(2+/-2%), where the most common morphology/mechanism appears to be consistent
with minor gas rich mergers or clump accretion. This work demonstrates that
while environment specific mechanisms affect galaxy evolution at this redshift,
they are diverse and their effects subtle. A full understanding of this

previously published Chandra position for this source. Based on the revised
X-ray position we have identified a new near-infrared (NIR) counterpart to GX
9+1 in Ks-band images obtained with the PANIC and FourStar cameras on the
Magellan Baade Telescope. NIR spectra of this Ks=16.5+-0.1 mag star taken with
the FIRE spectrograph on the Baade Telescope show a strong Br-gamma emission
line, which is a clear signature that we discovered the true NIR counterpart to
GX 9+1. The mass donor in GX 9+1 cannot be a late-type giant, as such a star
would be brighter than the estimated absolute Ks magnitude of the NIR
counterpart. The slope of the dereddened NIR spectrum is poorly constrained due
to uncertainties in the column density N_H and NIR extinction. Considering the
source's distance and X-ray luminosity, we argue that N_H likely lies near the
high end of the previously suggested range. If this is indeed the case, the NIR
spectrum is consistent with thermal emission from a heated accretion disk,
possibly with a contribution from the secondary. In this respect, GX 9+1 is
similar to other bright atolls and the Z sources whose NIR spectra do not show
the slope that is expected for a dominant contribution from optically thin
synchrotron emission from the inner regions of a jet.

when the initial population inversion exceeds some threshold value proportional
to the square root of the total number of atoms. Above this threshold, the
number of photons begins to grow exponentially with time and the pulse with
short leading edge and broadened trailing edge is generated. In this work, we
attempt to explain the nature of this threshold. Coherent pulse duration
estimated by its half-width increases significantly with increasing inversion,
if all other parameters are fixed and the absorption is neglected. The
inclusion of the energy loss of photons leads to the fact that the duration of
coherent pulse is almost constant with increasing inversion, at least well away
from the threshold. If there is exist a recovery mechanism for the population
inversion, the pulsating mode of stimulated emission generation becomes
possible. The integral radiation intensity at this may be increased several
times. This approach can be used for analysis of the cosmic radiation that
might help explain a great variety of pulsating radiation sources in space.

determinantal measures, understood as the convergence of the approximating
finite determinantal measures. In addition to the usual weak topology on the
space of probability measures on the space of configurations, we also consider
the weak topology on the space of finite measures on the space of finite
measures on the half-line, used via the natural immersion, well-defined almost
surely with respect to the infinite Bessel point process, of the space of
configurations into the space of finite measures on the half-line. The main
results of the second part are sufficient conditions for tightness of families
of determinantal measures, for convergence of sequences of induced proceses, as
well as for sequences of finite-dimensional perturbations of determinantal
processes.

descendant distribution of any Galton-Watson process satisfies a discrete
Smoluchowski coagulation equation with multiple coalescence. Using this we
obtain necessary and sufficient criteria for the convergence of scaling limits
of Galton-Watson processes that are simpler (and equivalent) to the classical
criteria obtained by Grimvall in 1974. Our results provide a clear and natural
interpretation, and an alternate proof, of the fact that the L\'evy jump
measure of certain CSBPs satisfies a generalized Smoluchowski equation. (This
result was previously proved by Bertoin and Le Gall in 2006.)
  Moreover, our analysis shows that the nonlinear scaling dynamics of CSBPs
becomes linear and purely dilatational when expressed in terms of the L\'evy
triple associated with the branching mechanism. We use this to prove existence
of universal critical Galton-Watson and CSBPs analogous to W. Doeblin's
""universal laws"". Namely, these universal processes generate all possible
critical and subcritical CSBPs as subsequential scaling limits.
  Our convergence results rely on a natural topology for L\'evy triples and a
continuity theorem for Bernstein transforms (Laplace exponents). We develop
these in a self-contained appendix.

Comparisons between my electronic structure calculations on oligoether chains

hazardous asteroid (162421) 2000 ET70. In addition to the radar data from 2000
ET70's apparition in 2012, our model incorporates optical lightcurves and
infrared spectra that were not included in the analysis of Naidu et al. (2013,
Icarus 226, 323-335). We confirm the general ""clenched fist"" appearance of the
Naidu et al. model, but compared to their model, our best-fit model is about
10% longer along its long principal axis, nearly identical along the
intermediate axis, and about 25% shorter along the short axis. We find the
asteroid's dimensions to be 2.9 km $\times$ 2.2 km $\times$ 1.5 km (with
relative uncertainties of about 10%, 15%, and 25%, respectively). With the
available data, 2000 ET70's period and pole position are degenerate with each
other. The radar and lightcurve data together constrain the pole direction to
fall along an arc that is about twenty-three degrees long and eight degrees
wide. Infrared spectra from the NASA InfraRed Telescope Facility (IRTF) provide
an additional constraint on the pole. Thermophysical modeling, using our
SHERMAN software, shows that only a subset of the pole directions, about twelve
degrees of that arc, are compatible with the infrared data. Using all of the
available data, we find that 2000 ET70 has a sidereal rotation period of 8.944
hours ($\pm$ 0.009 h) and a north pole direction of ecliptic coordinates
$(52^{\circ}, -60^{\circ}) \pm 6^{\circ}$. The infrared data, acquired over
several dates, require that the thermal properties (albedo, thermal inertia,
surface roughness) must change across the asteroid's surface. By incorporating
the detailed shape model and spin state into our thermal modeling, the multiple
ground-based observations at different viewing geometries have allowed us to
constrain the levels of the variations in the surface properties.

Equivalent) model is based on a combination of a truncated Taylor expansion of
a drag correction function and Reynolds averaging. It reduces the required
number of computational parcels to trace a cloud of particles in
Eulerian-Lagrangian methods for the simulation of particle-laden flow. Closure
is performed in an a priori manner using a reference simulation where all
particles in the cloud are traced individually with a point particle model.
Comparison of a first-order model and SPARSE with the reference simulation in
one-dimension shows that both the stress and the averaging of the carrier-phase
velocity on the cloud subscale affect the averaged motion of the particle. A
three-dimensional isotropic turbulence computation shows that only one
computational parcel is sufficient to accurately trace a cloud of tens of
thousand of particles.

showing that the problem of computing the permanent of a matrix is #P-hard.
Aaronson's proof led naturally to hardness of approximation results for the
permanent, and it was arguably simpler than Valiant's seminal proof of the same
fact in 1979. Nevertheless, it did not prove that computing the permanent was
#P-hard for any class of matrices which was not previously known. In this
paper, we present a collection of new results about matrix permanents that are
derived primarily via these linear optical techniques.
  First, we show that the problem of computing the permanent of a real
orthogonal matrix is #P-hard. Much like Aaronson's original proof, this will
show that even a multiplicative approximation remains #P-hard to compute. The
hardness result even translates to permanents over finite fields, where the
problem of computing the permanent of an orthogonal matrix is ModpP-hard in the
finite field F_{p^4} for all primes p not equal to 2 or 3. Interestingly, this
characterization is tight: in fields of characteristic 2, the permanent
coincides with the determinant; in fields of characteristic 3, one can
efficiently compute the permanent of an orthogonal matrix by a nontrivial
result of Kogan.
  Finally, we use more elementary arguments to prove #P-hardness for the
permanent of a positive semidefinite matrix, which shows that certain
probabilities of boson sampling experiments with thermal states are hard to
compute exactly despite the fact that they can be efficiently sampled by a
classical computer.

determined from a machine learning technique. The BBC fit determines 1) a

alpha and beta, which multiply the stretch and color (respectively) to
standardize the SN brightness. In the second stage, the bin-averaged HD is fit
to a cosmological model where priors can be imposed. We perform high precision
tests of the BBC method by simulating large (150,000 event) data samples

three models of intrinsic scatter, each with two different CC rates. In the BBC
fit, the SALT-II nuisance parameters alpha and beta are recovered to within 1%

equation of state parameter w using a fixed value of Omega_matter as a prior:
averaging over all six tests based on 6 x 150,000 = 900,000 SNe, there is a
small w-bias of 0.006 +- 0.002. Finally, the BBC fitting code is publicly

emission of electromagnetic radiation from a rotating point-like magnetic
dipole in vacuum. This emission mechanism predicts a braking index $n=3$, which
is not observed in highly magnetized neutron stars. Despite this fact, the
assumptions of a dipole field and rapid early rotation are often assumed a
priori, typically causing a discrepancy between the characteristic age and the
associated supernova remnant (SNR) age. We focus on neutron stars with
`anomalous' magnetic fields that have established SNR associations and known
ages. Anomalous X-ray pulsars (AXPs) and soft gamma repeaters (SGRs) are
usually described in terms of the magnetar model, which posits a large magnetic
field established by dynamo action. The high magnetic field pulsars (HBPs) have
extremely large magnetic fields just above QED scale (but below that of the
AXPs and SGRs), and central compact objects (CCOs) may have buried fields that
will emerge in the future as nascent magnetars. In the first part of this
series we examined magnetic field growth as a method of uniting the CCOs with
HBPs and X-ray dim isolated neutron stars (XDINSs) through evolution. In this
work we constrain the characteristic age of these neutron stars using the

Ornstein-Uhlenbeck diffusion given that the system is partially observed via a
linear diffusion-type (noisy) sensor. Under Gaussian assumptions, it provides a
finite-dimensional exact implementation of the optimal Bayes filter. It is
generally the only such finite-dimensional exact instance of the Bayes filter
for continuous state-space models. Consequently, this filter has been studied
extensively in the literature since the seminal 1961 paper of Kalman and Bucy.
The purpose of this work is to review, re-prove and refine existing results
concerning the dynamical properties of the Kalman-Bucy filter so far as they
pertain to filter stability and convergence. The associated differential matrix
Riccati equation is a focal point of this study with a number of bounds,
convergence, and eigenvalue inequalities rigorously proven. New results are
also given in the form of exponential and comparison inequalities for both the
filter and the Riccati flow.

algorithms become less effective in providing fast convergence. TCP-based
algorithms that probe for bandwidth take a long time to reach the fair-share
and lead to long flow completion times. An ideal congestion control algorithms
for datacenter must provide 1) zero data loss, 2) fast convergence, and 3) low
buffer occupancy. However, these requirements present conflicting goals. For
fast convergence,flows must ramp up quickly, but this risks packet losses and
large queues. Thus, even the state-of-the-art algorithms, such as TIMELY and
DCQCN, rely on link layer flow control (e.g.,Priority-based Flow Control) to
achieve zero loss. This paper presents a new approach, called ExpressPass, an
end-to-end credit-based congestion control algorithm for datacenters.
ExpressPass is inspired by credit-based flow control, but extends it to work
end-to-end. The switches control the amount of credit packets by rate limiting
and ensure data packets flow in the reverse direction without any loss.
ExpressPass leverages this to ramp up aggressively. ExpressPass converges up to
80 times faster than DCTCP at 10Gbps link, and the gap increases as link speeds
become faster. Our simulation with realistic workload shows that ExpressPass
significantly reduces the flow completion time especially for small and medium
size flows compared to DCTCP, HULL, and DX.

instantiation has little overhead, compared to manual model-based

initially prepared in its ground state, will evolve to its final ground state
with arbitrary precision. As a first result this thesis extends the original
theorem to projection operators keeping the statement valid for Hamiltonians
with degenerate ground spaces.
  Yet the main focus of this work lies in studying the efficiency of quantum
circuit simulations by adabatic quantum computation. The standard Hamiltonian
construction by Kitaev is based on a path graph reflecting the $L$ computation
steps and influencing the scaling of the necessary evolution time by its
spectral gap of $\mathcal{O}\left(\frac{1}{L^2}\right)$. Aspiring to an
improved running time we generalize Kitaev's Hamiltonian to so-called standard
graph Hamiltonians based on graph families with a different spectral gap.
  In this generalized construction the first two time derivatives of the
Hamiltonian and the fraction of initial vertices appear as additional
parameters of running time. In a first step the time derivatives can be proven
to be constant. Expansion results from spectral graph theory however impose a
trade-off between the spectral gap and the fraction of initial vertices as well
as the fraction of final vertices which corresponds to the probability for
obtaining the correct computational output. Graphs with spectral gap
$\mathcal{O}\left(\frac{1}{L^k}\right)$, $k<2$, turn out to contradict very
likely, graphs with $k<1$ even for sure at least one of the efficiency
criterias for running time, output probability or Hamiltonian implementation.
  The above results may also be obstacles for a possible quantum PCP-theorem in
complexity theory claiming the local Hamiltonian problem with constant gap to
be QMA-complete since the very same Kitaev Hamiltonian is constructed in the
QMA-hardness proof for the Local Hamiltonian problem.

$\sim$ few years. The scenario is based on a binary super-massive black hole
(SMBH) system in which one of the two SMBH carries a jet. We discuss the
various mechanisms that can cause the jet to precess and produce corkscrew
patterns through space with a scale of $\sim$ few pc. It turns out that the
dominant mechanism responsible for the precession is simply the imprint of the
jet-carrying SMBH orbital speed on the jet. Gravitational deflection and
Lense-Thirring precession (due to the gravitational field of the other SMBH)
are second order effects.
  We complement the scenario with a kinematical jet model which is inspired to
the spine-sheath structure observed in M87. One of the main advantages of such
a structure is that it allows the peak of the synchrotron emission to scale
with frequency according to $\nu F\propto \nu^{\xi}$ as the viewing angle is
changed, where $\xi$ is not necessarily 3 or 4 as in the case of jets with
uniform velocity, but can be $\xi \sim 1$.
  Finally, we apply the model to the source PG1553+113, which has been recently
claimed to show a $T_{\rm obs}=(2.18\pm 0.08)\text{ yr}$ periodicity. We are
able to reproduce the optical and gamma-ray light curves and multiple
synchrotron spectra simultaneously. We also give estimates of the source mass

the magnetic configurations in fusion devices and astrophysical plasmas. We
study the equilibrium reached by a localized magnetic field through the

for such a field a Taylor state is unattainable. We find an equilibrium plasma
configuration that is characterized by a lowered pressure in a toroidal region,
with field lines lying on surfaces of constant pressure. Therefore, the field
is in a Grad-Shafranov equilibrium. Localized helical magnetic fields are found
when plasma is ejected from astrophysical bodies and subsequently relaxes

of copies of S^1xS^2 and on the 3-tours as ambient manifolds. The skein space
of the 3-torus is computed. The Tait conjecture and Eisermann's theorem have
been extended to the connected sums of copies of S^1xS^2. The knots and links
in S^1xS^2 whose crossing number is at most 3 are tabulated.

infrastructure. This infrastructure offers important opportunities for sensing
and recording a multitude of human behaviors. Human mobility patterns are a
prominent example of such a behavior which has been studied based on cell phone
towers, Bluetooth beacons, and WiFi networks as proxies for location. However,
while mobility is an important aspect of human behavior, understanding complex
social systems requires studying not only the movement of individuals, but also
their interactions. Sensing social interactions on a large scale is a technical
challenge and many commonly used approaches---including RFID badges or
Bluetooth scanning---offer only limited scalability. Here we show that it is
possible, in a scalable and robust way, to accurately infer person-to-person
physical proximity from the lists of WiFi access points measured by smartphones
carried by the two individuals. Based on a longitudinal dataset of
approximately 800 participants with ground-truth interactions collected over a
year, we show that our model performs better than the current state-of-the-art.
Our results demonstrate the value of WiFi signals in social sensing as well as
potential threats to privacy that they imply.

As a first step towards more realistic stream histories, a toy model that
combines an idealized merger model with a simplified model of the internal

average, the velocity dispersion increases with distance causing the density of
the stream to decline with distance. Consequently, the streams visible in
current data will normally be some fraction of the entire stream. Nevertheless,
the high surface density segment of the stellar streams created from the

prediction takes advantage of the fact that neutrino and antineutrino
interactions with low nuclear recoil energy ($\nu$) have a nearly constant
cross section as a function of incident neutrino energy. This measurement is
the lowest energy application of the low-$\nu$ flux technique, the first time
it has been used in the NuMI antineutrino beam configuration, and demonstrates
that the technique is applicable to future neutrino beams operating at
multi-GeV energies. The cross section measurements presented are the most
precise measurements to date below 5 GeV.

significant attention in the field of particle physics. This article builds on
a particle-level view of collision events, in line with recently-proposed
subtraction methods. While conventional techniques in the field usually
concentrate on probability distributions, our study is, to our knowledge, the
first attempt at estimating the frequency distribution of background particles
across the kinematic space inside individual collision events. In fact, while
the probability distribution can generally be estimated given a model of
low-energy strong interactions, the corresponding frequency distribution inside
a single event typically deviates from the average and cannot be predicted a
priori. We present preliminary results in this direction, and establish a
connection between our technique and the particle weighting methods that have
been the subject of recent investigation at the Large Hadron Collider.

the anisotropy of the filter and thereby produces contrast within the Mueller

semi-transparent, nanostructured thin film with sub-wavelength thickness placed
within the object plane. The sample is illuminated as in common optical
microscopy but the light is modulated in its polarization using combinations of
linear polarizers and phase plate (compensator) to control and analyze the
state of polarization. Direct generalized ellipsometry data analysis approaches
permit extraction of fundamental Mueller matrix object plane images dispensing
with the need of Fourier expansion methods. Generalized ellipsometry model
approaches are used for quantitative image analyses. We demonstrate the
anisotropic contrast optical microscope by measuring lithographically defined
micro-patterned anisotropic filters, and we quantify the adsorption of an
organic self-assembled monolayer film onto the anisotropic filter. In our
current instrument we estimate the limit of detection for organic volumetric
mass within the object plane of $\approx$ 49 fg within $\approx$
7$\times$7~$\mu$m$^2$ object surface area. Compared to a quartz crystal
microbalance with dissipation instrumentation, where contemporary limits
require a total load of $\approx$ 500~pg for detection, the instrumentation
demonstrated here improves sensitivity to a total mass required for detection

innermost regions of core-collapse supernovae can yield important clues about
explosion asymmetries and the operation of the still disputed explosion
mechanism. Recent observations of radioactive $^{44}$Ti with high-energy
satellite telescopes (Nuclear Spectroscopic Telescope Array [NuSTAR], INTEGRAL)
have measured gamma-ray line details, which provide direct evidence of
large-scale explosion asymmetries in SN 1987A and in Cassiopeia A (Cas A) even
by mapping of the spatial brightness distribution (NuSTAR). Here we discuss a
3D simulation of a neutrino-driven explosion, using a parameterized neutrino
engine, whose $^{44}$Ti distribution is mostly concentrated in one hemisphere
pointing opposite to the neutron star (NS) kick velocity. Both exhibit
intriguing resemblance to the observed morphology of the Cas A remnant,
although neither the progenitor nor the explosion was fine-tuned for a perfect
match. Our results demonstrate that the asymmetries observed in this remnant
can, in principle, be accounted for by a neutrino-driven explosion, and that
the high $^{44}$Ti abundance in Cas A may be explained without invoking rapid
rotation or a jet-driven explosion, because neutrino-driven explosions
generically eject large amounts of high-entropy matter. The recoil acceleration
of the NS is connected to mass ejection asymmetries and is opposite to the
direction of the stronger explosion, fully compatible with the gravitational
tugboat mechanism. Our results also imply that Cas A and SN 1987A could possess
similarly ""one-sided"" Ti and Fe asymmetries, with the difference that Cas A is
viewed from a direction with large inclination angle to the NS motion, whereas
the NS in SN 1987A should have a dominant velocity component pointing toward
us.

kpc-scale jet and FRI type lobe morphology in this erstwhile `extended-core'
blazar but also delineate the morphological details, thanks to its arcsec scale
resolution. The radio light curve during the end phase of the outburst measured
in 2008 shows high variability (8.5%) in the jet emission in the GHz range,
compared to the lower core variability (3.2%) seen at the lowest frequencies.
The excess of flux density with a very steep spectral index in the MHz range
supports the presence of extra diffuse emission at low frequencies. The
analysis of multi wavelength (radio/ optical/ gamma-ray) light curves at
different radio frequencies confirms the variability of the core region and
agrees with the scenario of high energy emission in gamma-rays due to inverse
Compton emission from a collimated relativistic plasma jet followed by
synchrotron emission in radio. Clearly, these results give an interesting
insight of the jet emission mechanisms in blazars and highlight the importance
of studying such objects with low frequency radio interferometers like LOFAR
and the SKA and its precursor instruments.

  Path to Scientific Knowledge","11 pages",,,,"physics.gen-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Classical physics has enabled the acquisition of significant knowledge of the
physical properties of nature on a standard macroscopic scale. These
achievements were driven by use of the causal ontological approach (proposed
originally by Aristotle) to formulate models of physical reality. At the
beginning of the 20th century, however, the physics community began to prefer
models based on a fundamentally different approach to human knowledge.
Copenhagen quantum mechanics (CQM) was used to describe the micro-world. The
special theory of relativity was used to describe the kinematics of objects
moving at high velocity values in both the macroscopic and microscopic regions.
This phenomenological approach to knowledge has been more focused on how things
appear - instead of their actual properties and causal sequence. In the middle
of the 20th century, the causal ontological approach was used to develop a
significant scientific advance: the systematization of fundamental strongly
interacting particles on the basis of unified algebra in three-dimensional
isotopic spin space for spin values 1, 1/2, and 0. However, it was later
strongly deformed under the influence of the phenomenological approach and the
quark model. This paper will show that practically all contemporary theoretical
models of physical reality contain mistakes or unresolved problems. Further
scientific progress can be obtained if (and only if) scientists return to the
successful causal ontological approach and falsification. Classical physics may
be slightly generalized to enable the description of inertia mass increase in
dependence on velocity, replacing the relativity theory and CQM. New
assumptions may then be employed using generalized classical physics (GCP) to
formulate new descriptions of observed phenomena that were previously
inaccurately interpreted and used to promote fundamentally inadequate theories.
