prefixes of regular Independence-Friendly (IF) logic according to the patterns

""Henkin"" or ""signalling"" patterns were shown to characterize fragments of IF
logic that capture NP-complete problems; all the remaining prefixes were shown
instead to be essentially first-order.
  In the present paper we develop the machinery which is needed in order to
extend the results of Sevenster to non-prenex, regular IF sentences. This
involves shifting attention from quantifier prefixes to a (rather general)
class of syntactical tree prefixes.
  We partially classify the fragments of regular IF logic that are thus
determined by syntactical trees; in particular, a) we identify three tree
prefixes that are neither signalling nor Henkin, and yet express NP-complete
problems and other second-order concepts; and b) we give more general criteria
for checking the first-orderness of an IF sentence.

These CARMA data partially resolve the dust polarization, suggesting an uniform
morphology of polarization vectors with an average position angle of 57 degrees
and an average polarization fraction of 2.0%. The distribution of the
polarization vectors can be attributed to (1) the direct emission of
magnetically aligned grains of dust by a uniform magnetic field, or (2) the
pattern produced by the scattering of an inclined disk. We show that both
models can explain the observations, and perhaps a combination of the two
mechanisms produce the polarized emission. A third model including a toroidal
magnetic field does not match the observations. Assuming scattering is the
polarization mechanism, these observations suggest that during the first few
10000 years of high-mass star formation, grain sizes can grow from 1 to several
10s micron.

nonlinear glassy modes, are quasi-localized low-energy excitations. We present
an iterative method to solve the algebraic equations, and use it to study the

a model glass. Our key result is that the structure and energies associated
with harmonic glassy vibrational modes and their nonlinear counterparts
converge in the limit of very low frequencies. As nonlinear modes never suffer
hybridizations, our result implies that the presented theoretical framework
constitutes a robust alternative definition of `soft glassy modes' in the
thermodynamic limit, in which Goldstone modes overwhelm and destroy the
identity of low-frequency harmonic glassy modes.

the StrSort model. This model is a relaxation of the semi streaming model. The
graph is given as a stream of its edges and can only be read sequentially, but
while doing a pass over the stream we are allowed to write out another stream
which will be the input for the next pass. In addition, items in the stream are
sorted between passes. This model was introduced by Aggarwal et al. in 2004.
Here we apply this model to the problem of finding an Euler tour in a graph (or
to decide that the graph does not admit an Euler tour). The algorithm works in
two steps. In the first step, a single pass is conducted while a linear (in the
number of vertices $n$) amount of RAM is required. In the second step,
$\mathcal O(\log(n))$ passes are conducted while only $\mathcal O(\log(n))$ RAM
is required.
  We use an alteration of the algorithm of Atallah and Vishkin from 1984 for
finding Euler tours in parallel. It finds a partition of edge-disjoint circuits
and arranges them in a tree expressing their connectivity. Then the circuits
are merged according to this tree. In order to minimize the needed amount of
RAM, we evade the need to store the entire tree and use techniques suggested by
Aggarwal et al. to exchange information concerning the merging of circuits.

melodies in music. The model can be used to generate new melodies that emulate
the style of the musical corpus which was used to train it. Instead of using
the $n-$body interactions of $(n-1)-$order Markov models, traditionally used in
automatic music generation, we use a $k-$nearest neighbour model with pairwise
interactions only. In that way, we keep the number of parameters low and avoid
over-fitting problems typical of Markov models. We show that long-range musical
phrases don't need to be explicitly enforced using high-order Markov
interactions, but can instead emerge from multiple, competing, pairwise
interactions. We validate our Maximum Entropy model by contrasting how much the
generated sequences capture the style of the original corpus without
plagiarizing it. To this end we use a data-compression approach to discriminate
the levels of borrowing and innovation featured by the artificial sequences.
The results show that our modelling scheme outperforms both fixed-order and
variable-order Markov models. This shows that, despite being based only on
pairwise interactions, this Maximum Entropy scheme opens the possibility to
generate musically sensible alterations of the original phrases, providing a
way to generate innovation.

segments and the dynamics of segmentation and the total number of segments

to signaling gradients, and makes testable predictions about novel
perturbations. The variety of different patterns formed in our model can

the nature of the samples, it has been challenging to determine whether the

boundary method with adaptive mesh refinement (IBAMR) to numerically study the
effect of hematocrit on the circulation around a valveless. Both peristalsis
and dynamic suction pumping are considered. In the case of dynamic suction
pumping, the heart and circulatory system is simplified as a flexible tube
attached to a relatively rigid racetrack. For some Womersley number (Wo)
regimes, there is significant net flow around the racetrack. We find that the
addition of flexible blood cells does not significantly affect flow rates
within the tube for Wo $\leq$ 10. On the other hand, peristalsis consistently
drives blood around the racetrack for all Wo and for all hematocrit considered.

Energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (STEM-EDS) in particular has grown in

complicated by beam-sample interactions that are often overlooked by novice

the choice of ionization edge---that affect the quantification of a model

different thickness indicate that interface profiles can vary by as much as 2-5

multislice simulations, which reveal that on-axis maps of even perfectly abrupt
interfaces exhibit significant delocalization. Quantification of thicker
samples is further complicated by channeling to heavier sites across the
interface, as well as an increased signal background. We show that extreme care
must be taken to prepare samples to minimize channeling effects and argue that
it may not be possible to extract atomically-resolved information from many
chemical maps.

simulations to study the orbital evolution of these planets as their hosts
undergo common-envelope stages, losing in the process a tremendous amount of
mass on dynamical timescales. Five of the systems experience at least one
Roche-lobe overflow and common-envelope stages (Kepler-1647 experiences three),
and the binary stars either shrink to very short orbits or coalesce; two
systems trigger a double-degenerate supernova explosion. Kepler's circumbinary
planets predominantly remain gravitationally bound at the end of the
common-envelope phase, migrate to larger orbits, and may gain significant
eccentricity; their orbital expansion can be more than an order of magnitude
and can occur over the course of a single planetary orbit. The orbits these
planets can reach are qualitatively consistent with those of the currently
known post-common-envelope, eclipse-time variations circumbinary candidates.
Our results also show that circumbinary planets can experience both modes of
orbital expansion (adiabatic and non-adiabatic) if their host binaries undergo
more than one common-envelope stage; multiplanet circumbinary systems like
Kepler-47 can experience both modes during the same common-envelope stage.
Additionally, unlike Mercury orbiting the Sun, a circumbinary planet with the
same semi-major axis can survive the common envelope evolution of a close
binary star with a total mass of 1 MSun.

$\lesssim m c^2 \lesssim 345$ keV, can be an alternative interpretation of the
central compact object in Sgr A*. We present in this work the gravitational
lensing properties of this novel DM model in Milky Way-like spiral galaxies. We
describe the lensing effects of the pure DM component both on halo scales,
where we compare them to the effects of the Navarro-Frenk-White and the
Non-Singular Isothermal Sphere DM models, and near the galaxy center, where we
compare them with the effects of a Schwarzschild BH. For the particle mass
leading to the most compact DM core, $m c^2\approx 10^{2}$ keV, we draw the
following conclusions. At distances $r\gtrsim 20$ pc from the center of the
lens the effect of the central object on the lensing properties is negligible.
However, we show that measurements of the deflection angle produced by the DM
distribution in the outer region at a few kpc, together with rotation curve
data, could help to discriminate between different DM models. We show that at
distances $\sim 10^{-4}$ pc strong lensing effects, such as multiple images and
Einstein rings, may occur. Large differences in the deflection angle produced
by a DM central core and a central BH appear at distances $r\lesssim 10^{-6}$
pc; in this regime the weak-field formalism is no longer applicable and the
exact general-relativistic formula has to be used. We find that quantum DM
cores do not show a photon sphere what implies that they do not cast a shadow.
Similar conclusions apply to the other DM distributions for other fermion

sequence with a very high mean coverage in order to make sure that all parts of

with lots of redundant data. A filtering of this data prior to assembly is
advisable. Titus Brown et al. (2012) presented the algorithm Diginorm for this
purpose, which filters reads based on the abundance of their $k$-mers. We
present Bignorm, a faster and quality-conscious read filtering algorithm. An
important new feature is the use of phred quality scores together with a
detailed analysis of the $k$-mer counts to decide which reads to keep. With
recommended parameters, in terms of median we remove 97.15% of the reads while
keeping the mean phred score of the filtered dataset high. Using the SDAdes
assembler, we produce assemblies of high quality from these filtered datasets
in a fraction of the time needed for an assembly from the datasets filtered

reducing read data and for speeding up the assembly process. Our Bignorm

opens a gap in the surface state by stabilizing an antiferromagnetic state. The

Consequently, we (1) show that the step-sizes can be reliably used to terminate

to classical quadratic growth, imply that the step-sizes linearly bound the
distance of the iterates to the solution set. The latter so-called error bound
property is typically used to establish linear (or faster) convergence

convective and therefore unable to support magnetic dynamos like the one that
produces the 11-year solar cycle. Because of their intrinsic faintness, very
few late M stars have undergone long-term monitoring to test this prediction,
which is critical to our understanding of magnetic field generation in such
stars. Magnetic activity is also of interest as the driver of UV and X-ray
radiation, as well as energetic particles and stellar winds, that affect the
atmospheres of close-in planets that lie within habitable zones, such as the
recently discovered Proxima b. We report here on several years of optical, UV,
and X-ray observations of Proxima Centauri (GJ 551; dM5.5e): 15 years of ASAS
photometry in the V band (1085 nights) and 3 years in the I band (196 nights),
4 years of Swift XRT and UVOT observations (more than 120 exposures), and 9
sets of X-ray observations from other X-ray missions (ASCA, XMM-Newton, and
three Chandra instruments) spanning 22 years. We confirm previous reports of an
83-day rotational period and find strong evidence for a 7-year stellar cycle,
along with indications of differential rotation at about the solar level.
X-ray/UV intensity is anti-correlated with optical V-band brightness for both
rotational and cyclical variations. From comparison with other stars observed
to have X-ray cycles we deduce a simple empirical relationship between X-ray
cyclic modulation and Rossby number, and we also present Swift UV grism spectra
covering 2300-6000 {\AA}.

Cahn-Hilliard (CH) equation with constant and degenerate mobility in
three-dimensional porous media with non-vanishing velocity on the exterior
boundary. The CH equation describes phase separation of an immiscible binary
mixture at constant temperature in the presence of a mass constraint and
dissipation of free energy. Porous media/pore-scale problems specifically
entail high-resolution images of rocks in which the solid matrix and pore
spaces are fully resolved. The interior penalty discontinuous Galerkin method
is used for the spatial discretization of the CH equation in mixed form, while
a semi-implicit convex-concave splitting is utilized for temporal
discretization. The spatial approximation order is arbitrary, while it reduces
to a finite volume scheme for the choice of elementwise constants. The
resulting nonlinear systems of equations are reduced using the Schur complement
and solved via Newton's method. The numerical scheme is first validated using
numerical convergence tests and then applied to a number of fundamental
problems for validation and numerical experimentation purposes including the
case of degenerate mobility. First-order physical applicability and robustness
of the numerical method are shown in a breakthrough scenario on a voxel set
obtained from a micro-CT scan of a real sandstone rock sample.

formation and composition models take into account the structure and evolution
of the protoplanetary disk, the planetary mass growth by accretion of solids

show that planets can form at small orbital period in orbit about low mass
stars. We show that the radius of the planets is peaked at about 1 rearth and
that they are, in general, volatile rich especially if proto-planetary discs
orbiting this type of stars are long-lived. Close-in planets orbiting low-mass
stars similar in terms of mass and radius to the ones recently detected can be
formed within the framework of the core accretion paradigm as modeled here. The
properties of protoplanetary disks, and their correlation with the stellar
type, are key to understand their composition.

are a common feature in the X-ray emission of accreting black hole binaries. As
the QPOs originate from the innermost accretion flow, they provide the
opportunity to probe the behaviour of matter in extreme gravity. In this paper,
we present a systematic analysis of the inclination dependence of phase lags
associated with both Type-B and Type-C QPOs in a sample of 15 Galactic black
hole binaries. We find that the phase lag at the Type-C QPO frequency strongly
depends on inclination, both in evolution with QPO frequency and sign. Although
we find that the Type-B QPO soft lags are associated with high inclination
sources, the source sample is too small to confirm this as a significant
inclination dependence. These results are consistent with a geometrical origin
of Type-C QPOs and a different origin for Type-B and Type-C QPOs. We discuss
the possibility that the phase lags originate from a pivoting spectral power
law during each QPO cycle, while the inclination dependence arises from
differences in dominant relativistic effects. We also search for energy
dependences in the Type-C QPO frequency. We confirm this effect in the three
known sources (GRS 1915+105, H1743-322 and XTE J1550-564) and newly detect it
in XTE J1859+226. Lastly, our results indicate that the unknown inclination

Momentum and energy equations of the fluid flow are simplified under the

solve nonlinear differential equations for velocity and temperature profiles of
the blood flow. Variation of flow rate and shear stress for different values of
inclination angle and hematocrit parameter along the diseased part of artery

cantilever with respect to the optical beam and position-sensitive detector
(PSD) are often performed manually. This process is tedious and time-consuming
and sometimes damages the cantilever or tip. To increase the throughput of AFM
in industrial applications, the ability to automatically exchange and align the
cantilever in a very short time with sufficient accuracy is required. In this
paper, we present the development of an automated cantilever exchange and
optical alignment instrument. We present an experimental proof of principle by
exchanging various types of AFM cantilevers in 6 seconds with an accuracy
better than 2 um. The exchange and alignment unit is miniaturized to allow for
integration in a parallel AFM. The reliability of the demonstrator has also
been evaluated. Ten thousand continuous exchange and alignment cycles were
performed without failure. The automated exchange and alignment of the AFM
cantilever overcome a large hurdle toward bringing AFM into high-volume

systems with an a priori known controller, or to uncontrolled systems, and
often arises in problems in obstacle avoidance in mobile robotics. When used as
a constraint in finite horizon controller synthesis, the FSR set, and its
probability measure facilitates probabilistic collision avoidance, in contrast
to methods which presume the obstacles act in a worst-case fashion and generate
hard constraints that cannot be violated. We tailor our approach to accommodate
rigid body constraints, and show convexity is assured so long as the rigid body
shape of each obstacle is also convex. We extend methods for multi-obstacle
avoidance through mixed integer linear programming (with linear robot and
obstacle dynamics) to accommodate chance constraints that represent the FSR set
probability measure. We demonstrate our method on a rigid-body obstacle
avoidance scenario, in which a receding horizon controller is designed to avoid
several stochastically moving obstacles while reaching the desired goal. Our
approach can provide solutions when approaches that presume a worst-case action
from the obstacle fail.

of public tax dollars for local public projects. In this work, we consider the
question of fairly aggregating the preferences of community members to
determine an allocation of funds to projects. This problem is different from
standard fair resource allocation because of public goods: The allocated goods
benefit all users simultaneously. Fairness is crucial in participatory decision
making, since generating equitable outcomes is an important goal of these
processes. We argue that the classic game theoretic notion of core captures
fairness in the setting. To compute the core, we first develop a novel
characterization of a public goods market equilibrium called the Lindahl
equilibrium, which is always a core solution. We then provide the first (to our
knowledge) polynomial time algorithm for computing such an equilibrium for a
broad set of utility functions; our algorithm also generalizes (in a
non-trivial way) the well-known concept of proportional fairness. We use our
theoretical insights to perform experiments on real participatory budgeting
voting data. We empirically show that the core can be efficiently computed for
utility functions that naturally model our practical setting, and examine the
relation of the core with the familiar welfare objective. Finally, we address
concerns of incentives and mechanism design by developing a randomized
approximately dominant-strategy truthful mechanism building on the exponential
mechanism from differential privacy.

hypotheses based on social scientific theories in disaster research and then
operationalize them on unobtrusive, observational social media data. In
particular, we investigate the following phenomena: the source for blame; the
partisan predisposition; the concerned geographies; and the contagion of
complaining.
  This paper adds to the sociology of disasters research by exploiting a new,
rarely used data source (the social web), and by employing new computational
methods (such as sentiment analysis and retrospective cohort study design) on
this new form of data. In this regard, this work should be seen as the first
step toward drawing more challenging inferences on the sociology of disasters

We perform two-dimensional radiation hydrodynamics simulations that solve the
flow structure across the Bondi radius, from far outside of the Bondi radius
down to a central part which is larger than a circum-BH accretion disc. The
radiation from the unresolved circum-BH disc is analytically modeled
considering self-shadowing effect. We show that the flow settles into a steady
state, where the flow structure consists of two distinct parts: (1) bipolar
ionized outflowing regions, where the gas is pushed outward by thermal gas
pressure and super-Eddington radiation pressure, and (2) an equatorial neutral
inflowing region, where the gas falls toward the central BH without affected by
radiation feedback. The resulting accretion rate is much higher than that in
the case of isotropic radiation, far exceeding the Eddington-limited rate to
reach a value slightly lower than the Bondi one. The opening angle of the
equatorial inflowing region is determined by the luminosity and directional
dependence of the central radiation. We find that photoevaporation from its
surfaces set the critical opening angle of about ten degrees below which the
accretion to the BH is quenched. We suggest that the shadowing effect allows
even stellar-remnant BHs to grow rapidly enough to become high-redshift
supermassive BHs.

set of statistical thinking on this topic, of which much can be gained by a
mutual exchange of ideas. We frame GANs within the wider landscape of

modelling problems in related fields, such as econometrics and approximate

highlight hypothesis testing as a principle for learning in implicit generative
models, using which we are able to derive the objective function used by GANs,
and many other related objectives. The testing viewpoint directs our focus to
the general problem of density ratio estimation. There are four approaches for
density ratio estimation, one of which is a solution using classifiers to
distinguish real from generated data. Other approaches such as divergence

dynamically tuning the edge to a self-dual point poised between the 1D SPT and
trivial phases of the edge. By coupling these FSPT models to dynamical gauge

the expansion rate, the growth rate, and geometry of the Universe, and hence
can be used to measure key cosmological parameters. In a homogeneous Universe
the bispectrum is a function of five variables and unlike its two point
statistics counterpart -- the power spectrum, which is a function of only two
variables -- is difficult to analyse unless the information is somehow reduced.
The most commonly considered reduction schemes rely on computing angular
integrals over possible orientations of the bispectrum triangle, thus reducing
it to sets of function of only three variables describing the triangle shape.
We use Fisher information formalism to study the information loss associated
with this angular integration. Without any reduction, the bispectrum alone can
deliver constraints on the growth rate parameter $f$ that are better by a
factor of $2.5$ compared to the power spectrum, for a sample of luminous red
galaxies expected from near future galaxy surveys at a redshift of $z\sim0.65$.
At lower redshifts the improvement could be up to a factor of $3$. We find that
most of the information is in the azimuthal averages of the first three even
multipoles. This suggests that the bispectrum of every configuration can be
reduced to just three numbers (instead of a 2D function) without significant
loss of cosmologically relevant information.

small group of local and bright broad-line AGN through reverberation mapping
(RM). Statistical demographic studies can be carried out considering the
empirical scaling relation between the size of the BLR and the AGN optical
continuum luminosity. However, there are still biases against low-luminosity or
reddened AGN, in which the rest-frame optical radiation can be severely
absorbed/diluted by the host and the BLR emission lines could be hard to
detect. Our purpose is to widen the applicability of virial-based SE relations
to reliably measure the BH masses also for low-luminosity or intermediate/type
2 AGN that are missed by current methodology. We achieve this goal by
calibrating virial relations based on unbiased quantities: the hard X-ray
luminosities, in the 2-10 keV and 14-195 keV bands, that are less sensitive to
galaxy contamination, and the FWHM of the most important rest-frame NIR and
optical BLR emission lines. We built a sample of RM AGN having both X-ray
luminosity and broad optical/NIR FWHM measurements available in order to
calibrate new virial BH mass estimators. We found that the FWHM of the
H$\alpha$, H$\beta$ and NIR lines (i.e. Pa$\alpha$, Pa$\beta$ and
HeI$\lambda$10830) all correlate each other having negligible or small offsets.
This result allowed us to derive virial BH mass estimators based on either the
2-10 keV or 14-195 keV luminosity. We took also into account the recent
determination of the different virial coefficients $f$ for pseudo and classical
bulges. By splitting the sample according to the bulge type and adopting
separate $f$ factors we found that our virial relations predict BH masses of
AGN hosted in pseudobulges $\sim$0.5 dex smaller than in classical bulges.
Assuming the same average $f$ factor for both populations, a difference of
$\sim$0.2 dex is still found.

measurements are conducted on angular scales ${\theta}$ $\lesssim$ 1200 arcsec.
On scales ${\theta}$ $\lesssim$ 200 arcsec we find that the measurements are
corrupted by residual systematic effects associated with the instrumental beam
of the VLA data. Using simulations we show that we can successfully apply a
correction for these effects. Using the three lens samples (the SDSS DR10
sample, the BCG sample and the SDSS-FIRST matched object sample) we measure a
tangential shear signal that is inconsistent with zero at the 10${\sigma}$,
3.8${\sigma}$ and 9${\sigma}$ level respectively. Fitting an NFW model to the
detected signals we find that the ensemble mass profile of the BCG sample
agrees with the values in the literature. However, the mass profiles of the
SDSS DR10 and the SDSS-FIRST matched object samples are found to be shallower
and steeper than results in the literature respectively. The best-fitting
Virial masses for the SDSS DR10, BCG and SDSS-FIRST matched samples, derived
using an NFW model and allowing for a varying concentration factor, are
M$^{SDSS-DR10}_{200}$ = (1.2 $\pm$ 0.4) $\times$ 10$^{12}$M$_{\odot}$,

obscured quasars are in tension --- some indicate that obscured quasars have
higher halo mass compared to their unobscured counterparts, while others find
no difference. The former result is inconsistent with the simplest models of
quasar unification that rely solely on viewing angle, while the latter may
support such models. Here, using empirical relationships between dark matter
halo and supermassive black hole masses, we provide a simple evolutionary
picture that naturally explains these findings and is motivated by more
sophisticated merger-driven quasar fueling models. The model tracks the growth
rate of haloes, with the black hole growing in spurts of quasar activity in
order to ""catch-up"" with the $M_{\textrm{BH}}$ - $M_{\textrm{star}}$ -
$M_{\textrm{halo}}$ relationship. The first part of the quasar phase is
obscured and is followed by an unobscured phase. Depending on the luminosity
limit of the sample, driven by observational selection effects, a difference in
halo masses may or may not be significant. For high luminosity samples, the
difference can be large (a few to 10 times higher masses in obscured quasars),
while for lower luminosity samples the halo mass difference is very small, much
smaller than current observational constraints. Such a simple model provides a
qualitative explanation for the higher mass haloes of obscured quasars, as well
as rough quantitative agreement with seemingly disparate results.

intermediate redshift because it uses only the [OIII]5007 and H\beta\ emission
lines. We use the SDSS DR7 main galaxy sample and the
Baldwin-Phillips-Terlevich (BPT) diagnostic to calibrate the diagram at low
redshift. We find that the diagram can be divided into 3 regions: one occupied
mainly by the pure AGNs (KEx-AGN region), one dominated by composite galaxies
(KEx-composite region), and one contains mostly SFGs (KEx-SFG region). AGNs are
separated from SFGs in this diagram mainly because they preferentially reside
in luminous and massive galaxies and have high [OIII]/H\beta. The separation of
AGN from star-forming galaxies is even cleaner thanks to the additional
0.15/0.12 dex offset in [OIII] line width at fixed luminosity/stellar mass. We
apply the KEx diagram to 7,866 galaxies at 0.3 < z < 1 in the DEEP2 Galaxy
Redshift Survey, and compare it to an independent X-ray classification scheme
using Chandra observation. X-ray AGNs are mostly located in the KEx-AGN region

AGNs lie in the KEx-AGN region. These confirm the reliability of this

high-redshift galaxies show complex kinematics and a broad distribution of
gas-phase metallicity gradients. To understand these results, we use a suite of
high-resolution cosmological zoom-in simulations from the Feedback in Realistic
Environments (FIRE) project, which include physically motivated models of the
multi-phase ISM, star formation, and stellar feedback. Our simulations
reproduce the observed diversity of kinematic properties and metallicity
gradients, broadly consistent with observations at z=0-3. Strong negative
metallicity gradients only appear in galaxies with a rotating disk, but not all
rotationally supported galaxies have significant gradients. Strongly perturbed
galaxies with little rotation always have flat gradients. The kinematic
properties and metallicity gradient of a high-redshift galaxy can vary
significantly on short time-scales, associated with starburst episodes.
Feedback from a starburst can destroy the gas disk, drive strong outflows, and
flatten a pre-existing negative metallicity gradient. The time variability of a
single galaxy is statistically similar to the entire simulated sample,
indicating that the observed metallicity gradients in high-redshift galaxies
reflect the instantaneous state of the galaxy rather than the accretion and
growth history on cosmological time-scales. We find weak dependence of
metallicity gradient on stellar mass and specific star formation rate (sSFR).
Low-mass galaxies and galaxies with high sSFR tend to have flat gradients,
likely due to the fact that feedback is more efficient in these galaxies. We
argue that it is important to resolve feedback on small scales in order to
produce the diverse metallicity gradients observed.

distributions of their orbital parameters (OPs) is important for a wide range
of topics, from stellar feedback to binary evolution channels, from the
distribution of supernova types to gravitational wave progenitors, yet, no
direct measurements exist outside the Milky Way. The Tarantula Massive Binary
Monitoring was designed to help fill this gap by obtaining multi-epoch radial
velocity monitoring of 102 MBs in the 30 Dor. In this paper, we analyse 32
VLT/FLAMES observations of 93 O- and 7 B-type binaries. We performed a Fourier
analysis and obtained orbital solutions for 82 systems: 51 single- and 31
double-lined spectroscopic binaries. Overall, the OPs and binary fraction are
remarkably similar across the 30 Dor region and compared to existing Galactic
samples (GSs). This indicates that within these domains environmental effects
are of second order in shaping the properties of MBs. A small difference is
found in the distribution of orbital periods (OrbPs), which is slightly flatter
(in log space) in 30 Dor than in the Galaxy, although this may be compatible
within error estimates and differences in the fitting methodology. Also, OrbPs
in 30 Dor can be as short as 1.1 d; somewhat shorter than seen in GSs. Equal
mass binaries q>0.95 in 30 Dor are all found outside NGC 2070 the very young
and massive cluster at 30 Dor's core. One outstanding exception however is the
fact that earliest spectral types (O2-O7) tend to have shorter OrbPs than
latter (O9.2-O9.7). Our results point to a relative universality of the
incidence rate of MBs and their OPs in the metallicity range from solar
($Z_{\odot}$) to about $0.5Z_{\odot}$. This provides the first direct
constraints on MB properties in massive star-forming galaxies at the Universes

3250+/-50K, with significant variation as a function of wavelength. Based on
our observations, and previous measurements of KELT-1b's eclipse at other
wavelengths, we find that KELT-1b's day side appears identical to an isolated
3200K brown dwarf, and our modeling of the atmospheric emission shows a
monotonically decreasing temperature-pressure profile. This is in contrast to
hot Jupiters with similar day side brightness temperatures near 3000K, all of
which appear to be either isothermal or posses a stratospheric temperature
inversion. We hypothesize that the lack of an inversion in KELT-1b is due to
its high surface gravity, which we argue could be caused by the increased
efficiency of cold-trap processes within its atmosphere.

baseline triangles. We use long time span, high cadence, GRMHD+radiative
transfer models of Sgr A$^*$ to investigate the expected variability of closure
phases in such observations. We find that, in general, closure phases along
small baseline triangles show little variability, except in the cases when one
of the triangle vertices crosses one of a small regions of low visibility
amplitude. The closure phase variability increases with the size of the
baseline triangle, as larger baselines probe the small-scale structures of the
images, which are highly variable. On average, the jet-dominated MAD models
show less closure phase variability than the disk-dominated SANE models, even
in the large baseline triangles, because the images from the latter are more
sensitive to the turbulence in the accretion flow. Our results suggest that
image reconstruction techniques need to explicitly take into account the
closure phase variability, especially if the quality and quantity of data allow
for a detailed characterization of the nature of variability. This also implies
that, if image reconstruction techniques that rely on the assumption of a
static image are utilized, regions of the $u-v$ space that show a high level of
variability will need to be identified and excised.

$P_{\mathrm{fp}}$. We investigate how a precession model can account for such a
decrease in $P_{\mathrm{fp}}$, in terms of an increase over time in the
absolute biaxial deformation ($|\epsilon_{\mathrm{p}}|{\sim}10^{-8}$) of this
pulsar. We perform a Bayesian model comparison against the 'base' precession
model (with constant $\epsilon_{\mathrm{p}}$) developed in Ashton et al (2016),

two types of time-variation: (i) a linear drift with a posterior estimate of

$10^{75}$ compared to the base-model, and (ii) $N$ discrete positive jumps in
$\epsilon_{\mathrm{p}}$ with very similar odds to the linear
$\epsilon_{\mathrm{p}}$-drift model. The physical mechanism explaining this
behaviour is unclear, but the observation could provide a crucial probe of the

channel state information at the transmitter side (CSIT) is crucial. In this
paper, a practical CSIT estimation scheme is proposed for frequency division
duplexing (FDD) massive MIMO systems. Specifically, each received pilot symbol
is first quantized to one bit per dimension at the receiver side and then the
quantized bits are fed back to the transmitter. A joint one-bit compressed
sensing algorithm is implemented at the transmitter to recover the channel
matrices. The algorithm leverages the hidden joint sparsity structure in the
user channel matrices to minimize the training and feedback overhead, which is
considered to be a major challenge for FDD systems. Moreover, the one-bit
compressed sensing algorithm accurately recovers the channel directions for
beamforming. The one-bit feedback mechanism can be implemented in practical
systems using the uplink control channel. Simulation results show that the
proposed scheme nearly achieves the maximum output signal-to-noise-ratio for
beamforming based on the estimated CSIT.

scattering problems induced by point source waves (PSWs) and hyper-singular

be approximated by the scattered fields due to PSWs. With these properties and
a novel reciprocity relation of the total field, we prove that the rough
surface and the buried obstacle can be uniquely determined by the scattered
near-field data measured only on a line segment above the rough surface. The
proof substantially relies upon constructing a well-posed interior transmission

reasonable for the real world, even if the details of the controls are not, as
could be the case when the key differences lie in detailed friction, contact,
mass and geometry properties. During execution, at each time step our approach
computes what the simulation-based control policy would do, but then, rather
than executing these controls on the real robot, our approach computes what the

learned deep inverse dynamics model to decide which real-world action is most
suitable to achieve those next states. Deep models are only as good as their

the so-called ""supermarket model"" in which arriving customers join the shortest
of $d$ randomly selected queues. Assuming rate $n\lambda_{n}$ Poisson arrivals
and rate $1$ exponentially distributed service times, we consider this model in
the heavy traffic regime, described by $\lambda_{n}\uparrow 1$ as $n\to\infty$.
We give a simple expectation argument establishing that majority of queues have
steady state length at least $\log_d(1-\lambda_{n})^{-1} - O(1)$ with
probability approaching one as $n\rightarrow\infty$, implying the same for the
steady state delay of a typical customer.
  Our main result concerns the detailed behavior of queues with length smaller
than $\log_d(1-\lambda_{n})^{-1}-O(1)$. Assuming $\lambda_{n}$ converges to $1$
at rate at most $\sqrt{n}$, we show that the dynamics of such queues does not
follow a diffusion process, as is typical for queueing systems in heavy
traffic, but is described instead by a deterministic infinite system of linear
differential equations, after an appropriate rescaling. The unique fixed point
solution of this system is shown explicitly to be of the form
$\pi_{1}(d^{i}-1)/(d-1), i\ge 1$, which we conjecture describes the steady
state behavior of the queue lengths after the same rescaling. Our result is
obtained by combination of several technical ideas including establishing the
existence and uniqueness of an associated infinite dimensional system of

filtergrams of a photospheric Fe I spectral line. Meanwhile, the Sunrise Filter
Imager (SuFI) captured the highly dynamic chromospheric response to the
magnetic fields pushing their way through the lower solar atmosphere. The
serendipitous capture of this event offers a closer look at the inner workings
of active region emergence sites. In particular, it reveals in meticulous
detail how the rising magnetic fields interact with the granulation as they
push through the Sun's surface, dragging photospheric plasma in their upward
travel. The plasma that is burdening the rising field slides along the field
lines, creating fast downflowing channels at the footpoints. The weight of this
material anchors this field to the surface at semi-regular spatial intervals,
shaping it in an undulatory fashion. Finally, magnetic reconnection enables the
field to release itself from its photospheric anchors, allowing it to continue
its voyage up to higher layers. This process releases energy that lights up the
arch-filament systems and heats the surrounding chromosphere.

liquid sheet from near the contact line of the spreading liquid. This sheet is
lifted from the substrate and ultimately breaks apart. Surprisingly, the splash
is caused by the ambient gas, whose properties dictate when and if the sheet is
created. Here I focus on two aspects of this process. Using high-speed imaging
I find that the time of thin-sheet creation displays a different quantitative
dependence on air pressure if the sheet is created during the early stages of
spreading, rather than when the liquid has already spread to a large radius.
This result sheds light on previously observed impact velocity regimes.
Additionally, by measuring impacts of drops on surfaces comprised of both rough
and smooth regions, I identify a new threshold velocity that limits the times
at which the thin sheet can be created. This velocity determines the threshold
pressure below which splashing is suppressed.

recoverability of the source data, a repairer continually reads data over a

nearest neighbor descriptor voting and demonstrate how the algorithm naturally
emerges from the problem formulation. Based on the observation that the number
of votes for matching places can be evaluated using a binomial distribution
model, loop closures can be detected with high precision. By casting the
problem into a probabilistic framework, we not only remove the need for
commonly employed heuristic parameters but also provide a powerful score to
classify matching and non-matching places. We present methods for both a 2D-2D
pose-graph vertex matching and a 2D-3D landmark matching based on the above
scoring. The approach maintains accuracy while being efficient enough for
online application through the use of compact (low dimensional) descriptors and
fast nearest neighbor retrieval techniques. The proposed methods are evaluated
on several challenging datasets in varied environments, showing
state-of-the-art results with high precision and high recall.

we use dynamic movement primitives (DMPs) to represent a skill and a neural

k-essence field set-up, this instability manifests itself as an IR ghost for
the scalar field perturbation, but this can be interpreted as a classical
instability that becomes relevant below some momentum scale in terms of matter
density perturbations. We also consider the effect of the background evolution
influenced by matter on the stability of the gravity sector perturbations. In
particular, we address the previous claims of ghost instability in the IR
around the late time attractor. We show that, although the matter-induced
modification of the evolution potentially brings tension to the stability
conditions, one goes beyond the regime of validity of the effective theory well
before the solutions become unstable. We also draw attention to the fact that
the IR stability conditions are also enforced by the existence requirements of

is precision and innovative manufacturing in large size - production of large

cavity quantum electrodynamics and vacuum birefringence measurement. There are
stringent requirements on the substrate materials and coating methods. For
cryogenic GW interferometer, appropriate coating on sapphire or silicon are
required for good thermal and homogeneity properties. Large ultrahigh vacuum

metrology system are required and will be addressed. For space interferometry,
drag-free technology is well-developed; weak-light phase locking is

lattices with unequal numbers of sites in the two sublattices have a number of
unique features, including the presence of spatially localized eigenstates and
flat bands. When a \emph{uniform} on-site Hubbard interaction $U$ is turned on,
Lieb proved rigorously that at half filling ($\rho=1$) the ground state has a
non-zero spin. In this paper we consider a `CuO$_2$ lattice (also known as
`Lieb lattice', or as a decorated square lattice), in which `$d$-orbitals'
occupy the vertices of the squares, while `$p$-orbitals' lie halfway between
two $d$-orbitals. We use exact Determinant Quantum Monte Carlo (DQMC)
simulations to quantify the nature of magnetic order through the behavior of
correlation functions and sublattice magnetizations in the different orbitals
as a function of $U$ and temperature. We study both the homogeneous (H) case,
$U_d= U_p$, originally considered by Lieb, and the inhomogeneous (IH) case,
$U_d\neq U_p$. For the H case at half filling, we found that the global
magnetization rises sharply at weak coupling, and then stabilizes towards the
strong-coupling (Heisenberg) value, as a result of the interplay between the
ferromagnetism of like sites and the antiferromagnetism between unlike sites;
we verified that the system is an insulator for all $U$. For the IH system at
half filling, we argue that the case $U_p\neq U_d$ falls under Lieb's theorem,
provided they are positive definite, so we used DQMC to probe the cases
$U_p=0,U_d=U$ and $U_p=U, U_d=0$. We found that the different environments of
$d$ and $p$ sites lead to a ferromagnetic insulator when $U_d=0$; by contrast,
$U_p=0$ leads to to a metal without any magnetic ordering. In addition, we have
also established that at density $\rho=1/3$, strong antiferromagnetic
correlations set in, caused by the presence of one fermion on each $d$ site.

which has been the subject of controversial scientific discussion. The ""direct""
friction term due to the thermal fluctuations of the electromagnetic field
leads to a friction force proportional to 1/Z^5 where Z is the atom-wall

thermal fluctuations of the atomic dipole moment onto the motion of the atom
and scales as 1/Z^8. We investigate noncontact friction effects for the
interactions of hydrogen, ground-state helium and metastable helium atoms with
alpha-quartz (SiO_2), gold (Au) and calcium difluorite (CaF_2). We find that
the backaction term dominates over the direct term induced by the thermal
electromagnetic fluctuations inside the material, over wide distance ranges.
The friction coefficients obtained for gold are smaller than those for SiO_2

a broadband frequency range. And the optical activity of multi-layer chiral
metamaterials is proportional to the layer numbers of single-layer chiral

electromagnetic waves and permittivity of dielectric substrate, thereby
enabling more flexibility in polarization manipulation.

videos and audios, can be challenging with syntactic anonymization methods
which are designed for discrete attributes. Differential privacy, which
provides a more formal definition of privacy, has shown more success in
sanitizing continuous data. However, both syntactic and differential privacy
are susceptible to inference attacks, i.e., an adversary can accurately infer
sensitive attributes from sanitized data. The paper proposes a novel
filter-based mechanism which preserves privacy of continuous and
high-dimensional attributes against inference attacks. Finding the optimal
utility-privacy tradeoff is formulated as a min-diff-max optimization problem.
The paper provides an ERM-like analysis of the generalization error and also a
practical algorithm to perform the optimization. In addition, the paper
proposes an extension that combines minimax filter and differentially-private
noisy mechanism. Advantages of the method over purely noisy mechanisms is
explained and demonstrated with examples. Experiments with several real-world
tasks including facial expression classification, speech emotion
classification, and activity classification from motion, show that the minimax
filter can simultaneously achieve similar or better target task accuracy and
lower inference accuracy, often significantly lower than previous methods.

spatial objects in streaming queries, where, given a set of objects O, a stream
of spatial queries (kNN or range), the goal is to report m objects with the
highest aggregate rank. The rank of an object w.r.t. an individual query is
computed based on its distance from the query location, and the aggregate rank
is computed from all of the individual rank orderings. Solutions to this
fundamental problem can be used to monitor the popularity of spatial objects,
which in turn can provide new analytical tools for spatial data. Our work draws
inspiration from three different domains: rank aggregation, continuous queries
and spatial databases. To the best of our knowledge, there is no prior work
that considers all three problem domains in a single context. Our problem is
different from the classical rank aggregation problem in the way that the rank
of spatial objects are dependent on streaming queries whose locations are not
known a priori, and is different from the problem of continuous spatial queries
because new query locations can arrive in any region, but do not move. In order
to solve this problem, we show how to upper and lower bound the rank of an
object for any unseen query. Then we propose an approximation solution to
continuously monitor the top-m objects efficiently, for which we design an
Inverted Rank File (IRF) index to guarantee the error bound of the solution. In
particular, we propose the notion of safe ranking to determine whether the
current result is still valid or not when new queries arrive, and propose the
notion of validation objects to limit the number of objects to update in the
top-m results. We also propose an exact solution for applications where an
approximate solution is not sufficient. Last, we conduct extensive experiments
to verify the efficiency and effectiveness of our solutions.

standard BIE methods based on the Green's function of the background medium

waves in numerical methods that directly discretize the physical space. Our
PML-based BIE method uses the Green's function of the PML-transformed free
space to define the boundary integral operators. The method is efficient, since
the Green's function of the PML-transformed free space is easy to evaluate and
the PMLs are very effective in truncating the unbounded interfaces. Numerical
examples are presented to validate our method and demonstrate its accuracy.

schemes and statistical learning, which has been mostly investigated within the
framework of binary classification. The central theme of this work is
establishing equivalences between learnability and compressibility, and
utilizing these equivalences in the study of statistical learning theory.
  We begin with the setting of multiclass categorization (zero/one loss). We
prove that in this case learnability is equivalent to compression of
logarithmic sample size, and that uniform convergence implies compression of
constant size.
  We then consider Vapnik's general learning setting: we show that in order to
extend the compressibility-learnability equivalence to this case, it is
necessary to consider an approximate variant of compression.
  Finally, we provide some applications of the compressibility-learnability
equivalences:
  (i) Agnostic-case learnability and realizable-case learnability are
equivalent in multiclass categorization problems (in terms of sample
complexity).
  (ii) This equivalence between agnostic-case learnability and realizable-case
learnability does not hold for general learning problems: There exists a
learning problem whose loss function takes just three values, under which
agnostic-case and realizable-case learnability are not equivalent.
  (iii) Uniform convergence implies compression of constant size in multiclass
categorization problems. Part of the argument includes an analysis of the
uniform convergence rate in terms of the graph dimension, in which we improve
upon previous bounds.
  (iv) A dichotomy for sample compression in multiclass categorization
problems: If a non-trivial compression exists then a compression of logarithmic
size exists.
  (v) A compactness theorem for multiclass categorization problems.

given noisy samples. It is useful in a variety of problems ranging from
dimensionality reduction to anomaly detection and the visualization of high

with missing data, but is also sensitive to outliers. PCA is also known to have
a phase transition when noise is independent and identically distributed;
recovery of the subspace sharply declines at a threshold noise variance.
Effective use of PCA requires a rigorous understanding of these behaviors. This
paper provides a step towards an analysis of PCA for samples with
heteroscedastic noise, that is, samples that have non-uniform noise variances
and so are no longer identically distributed. In particular, we provide a
simple asymptotic prediction of the recovery of a one-dimensional subspace from
noisy heteroscedastic samples. The prediction enables: a) easy and efficient
calculation of the asymptotic performance, and b) qualitative reasoning to
understand how PCA is impacted by heteroscedasticity (such as outliers).

factor underlies cosmological inference from virtually all kinds of
cosmological observations, leading to the emergence of the LambdaCDM
cosmological model. This relation is not a fundamental theory and thus
observational determination of this function (redshift remapping) should be
regarded as an insightful alternative to holding its standard form in analyses
of cosmological data. Here we present non-parametric reconstructions of
redshift remapping in dark-matter-dominated models and constraints on
cosmological parameters from a joint analysis of all primary cosmological
probes including the local measurement of the Hubble constant, Type Ia
supernovae, baryonic acoustic oscillations (BAO), Planck observations of the
cosmic microwave background (CMB) radiation (temperature power spectrum) and
cosmic chronometers. The reconstructed redshift remapping points to an
additional boost of redshift operating in late epoch of cosmic evolution, but
affecting both low-redshift observations and the CMB. The model predicts a
significant difference between the actual Hubble constant, h=0.48+/-0.02, and
its local determination, h_obs=0.73+/-0.02. The ratio of these two values
coincides closely with the maximum expansion rate inside voids formed in the
corresponding open cosmological model with Omega_m=0.87+/-0.03, whereas the
actual value of the Hubble constant implies the age of the Universe that is
compatible with the Planck LambdaCDM cosmology. The new dark-matter-dominated
model with redshift remapping provides excellent fits to all data and
eliminates recently reported tensions between the Planck LambdaCDM cosmology,
the local determination of the Hubble constant and the BAO measurements from
the Ly-alpha forest of high-redshift quasars.

counts and Minkowski functionals. We first show that while the convergence
power spectrum does have sensitivity to the current value of extra scalar
degree of freedom $|f_{\rm R0}|$, it is largely compensated by a change in the
present density amplitude parameter $\sigma_{8}$ and the matter density
parameter $\Omega_{\rm m0}$. With accurate covariance matrices obtained from
1000 lensing simulations, we then examine the constraining power of the three
additional statistics. We find that these probes are indeed helpful to break
the parameter degeneracy, which can not be resolved from the power spectrum
alone. We show that especially the peak counts and Minkowski functionals have
the potential to rigorously (marginally) detect the signature of modified
gravity with the parameter $|f_{\rm R0}|$ as small as $10^{-5}$ ($10^{-6}$) if
we can properly model them on small ($\sim 1\, \mathrm{arcmin}$) scale in a
future survey with a sky coverage of 1,500 squared degrees. We also show that
the signal level is similar among the additional three statistics and all of
them provide complementary information to the power spectrum. These findings
indicate the importance of combining multiple probes beyond the standard power
spectrum analysis to detect possible modifications to General Relativity.

of a sphere with an axis-symmetric wake is modified in the presence of thin
three-dimensional elliptic-shaped protrusions. By investigating a wide range of
three-dimensional appendages with different aspect ratios and lengths, we
clearly show that the sphere with an appendage may robustly undergo an
inverted-pendulum-like (IPL) instability. This means that the position of the
appendage placed behind the sphere and aligned with the free-stream direction
is unstable, in a similar way that an inverted pendulum is unstable under
gravity. Due to this instability, non-trivial forces are generated on the body,
leading to turn and drift, if the body is free to fall under gravity. Moreover,
we identify the aspect ratio and length of the appendage that induces the
largest side force on the sphere, and therefore also the largest drift for a
freely falling body. Finally, we explain the physical mechanisms behind these
observations in the context of the IPL instability, i.e., the balance between
surface area of the appendage exposed to reversed flow in the wake and the
surface area of the appendage exposed to fast free-stream flow.

subspace clustering problem, various subspace clustering algorithms have been
proposed and low rank representation based subspace clustering is a very
promising and efficient subspace clustering algorithm. Low rank representation
method seeks the lowest rank representation among all the candidates that can
represent the data points as linear combinations of the bases in a given
dictionary. Nuclear norm minimization is adopted to minimize the rank of the
representation matrix. However, nuclear norm is not a very good approximation
of the rank of a matrix and the representation matrix thus obtained can be of
high rank which will affect the final clustering accuracy. Weighted nuclear
norm (WNN) is a better approximation of the rank of a matrix and WNN is adopted

copies of a positive r. v. $\rho$ on each vertex as the vertex weights. For the
SIR model, each vertex is in one of the three states `susceptible', `infective'

proportional to the production of the weights of these two vertices. An
infective vertex becomes removed at a constant rate. A removed vertex will
never be infected again. We assume that at $t=0$ there is no removed vertex and
the number of infective vertices follows a Bernoulli distribution
$B(n,\theta)$. Our main result is a law of large numbers of the model. We give
two deterministic functions $H_S(\psi_t), H_V(\psi_t)$ for $t\geq 0$ and show
that for any $t\geq 0$, $H_S(\psi_t)$ is the limit proportion of susceptible

gravity, we study their observational predictions at different scales. In order
to pass the local tests of gravity while allowing for long-range interactions

chameleon. The chameleon screening mechanism has been tested recently using
atom interferometry in a vacuum chamber. Numerical simulations are provided in
this thesis in order to refine the analytical predictions. At the astrophysical
scale, Horndeski gravity predicts a variation of the gravitational coupling

the Higgs vacuum expectation value varies inside stars and conclude whether the
effect is detectable in gravitational and nuclear physics. Finally, the

term such that it might pass the local tests of gravity thanks to the
Vainshtein screening mechanism. We discuss if a sub-class of the covariant

leading theories for the study of consciousness. IIT essentially proposes that
quantitative consciousness is identical to maximally integrated conceptual
information, quantified by a measure called $\Phi^{max}$, and that
phenomenological experience corresponds to the associated set of maximally
irreducible cause-effect repertoires of a physical system being in a certain
state. However, in order to ultimately apply the theory to experimental data, a
sufficiently general formulation is needed. With the current work, we provide
this general formulation, which comprehensively and parsimoniously expresses
$\Phi^{max}$ in the language of probabilistic models. Here, the stochastic
process describing a system under scrutiny corresponds to a first-order
time-invariant Markov process, and all necessary mathematical operations for
the definition of $\Phi^{max}$ are fully specified by a system's joint
probability distribution over two adjacent points in discrete time. We present
a detailed constructive rule for the decomposition of a system into two
disjoint subsystems based on flexible marginalization and factorization of this
joint distribution. Furthermore, we suspend the approach of interventional
calculus based on system perturbations, which allows us to omit undefined
conditional distributions and virtualization. We validate our formulation in a
previously established discrete example system, in which we furthermore address
the previously unexplored theoretical issue of quale underdetermination due to
non-uniqueness of maximally irreducible cause-effect repertoires, which in turn
also entails the sensitivity of $\Phi^{max}$ to the shape of the conceptual
structure in qualia space. In constructive spirit, we propose several
modifications of the framework in order to address some of these issues.

While visual inspection of OCT volumes remains the main method for AMD
identification, doing so is time consuming as each cross-section within the
volume must be inspected individually by the clinician. In much the same way,
acquiring ground truth information for each cross-section is expensive and time
consuming. This fact heavily limits the ability to acquire large amounts of
ground truth, which subsequently impacts the performance of learning-based
methods geared at automatic pathology identification. To avoid this burden, we
propose a novel strategy for automatic analysis of OCT volumes where only
volume labels are needed. That is, we train a classifier in a semi-supervised

to show a peculiar behavior: its X-ray flux decreased significantly and type I
outbursts were missed in several cases. At the same time, the spin frequency of
the neutron star, which had been increasing steadily since the end of the 2006
giant outburst, reached a plateau. Very recent observations indicate that the
source is now starting to spin down. These observed phenomena have a striking
similarity with those which took place 20 years ago, just before the source
displayed a sudden orbital phase shift of the outburst peak (1995). This
historical event occurred at the time exactly between the two giant outbursts
(1985 and 2006). These phenomena suggest the system to have an underlying
periodicity of 10.5 years between orbital phase shifts and/or giant outbursts.
The suggested periodicity may reflect some long-period dynamics in the
circumstellar disk of the Be star, due, e.g., to the Kozai-Lidov effect. A
model generating such a periodic change of the Be disk, namely Kozai-Lidov
oscillations in the Be disk, is discussed. If this behavior is really
periodical, another phase shift of the X-ray outburst peak is predicted to
occur around 2016 December.

against over the best classical algorithms by using less universal quantum
devices, is an important near-term milestone for quantum information
processing. Here we develop a threshold theorem for quantum supremacy with
noisy quantum circuits in the pre-threshold region, where quantum error
correction does not work directly. We show that, even in such a region, we can
virtually simulate quantum error correction by postselection. This allows us to
show that the output sampled from the noisy quantum circuits (without
postselection) cannot be simulated efficiently by classical computers based on
a stable complexity theoretical conjecture, i.e., non-collapse of the
polynomial hierarchy. By applying this to fault-tolerant quantum computation
with the surface codes, we obtain the threshold value $2.84\%$ for quantum
supremacy, which is much higher than the standard threshold $0.75\%$ for
universal fault-tolerant quantum computation with the same circuit-level noise
model. Moreover, contrast to the standard noise threshold, the origin of
quantum supremacy in noisy quantum circuits is quite clear; the threshold is
determined purely by the threshold of magic state distillation, which is
essential to gain a quantum advantage.

using the values of the solution computed on the boundary of the patches These

between magnons and electrons enables us to obtain a nonvanishing torque. In
this paper, we consider a model of the heterostructure in which a

order to integrate multiple person's information in a group-level image, we
propose an information aggregation method to generate three features for face,
upperbody and scene, respectively. We fuse face, upperbody and scene
information for robustness of GER against the challenging environments.
Intensive experiments are performed on two challenging group-level emotion
databases to investigate the role of face, upperbody and scene as well as

as a mixture mass moves down slope is a long-standing challenge. Here, we
propose an extension of the two phase mass flow model (Pudasaini, 2012) by
including a new mechanism, called separation-flux, that leads to strong
phase-separation in avalanche and debris flows while balancing the enhanced
solid flux with the reduced fluid flux. The separation flux mechanism is
capable of describing the dynamically evolving phase-separation and levee
formation in a multi-phase, geometrically three-dimensional debris flow. These
are often observed phenomena in natural debris flows and industrial processes
that involve the transportation of particulate solid-fluid mixture material.
The novel separation-flux model includes several dominant physical and
mechanical aspects such as pressure gradients, volume fractions of solid and
fluid phases and their gradients, shear-rates, flow depth, material friction,
viscosity, material densities, topographic constraints, grain size, etc. Due to
the inherent separation mechanism, as the mass moves down slope, more and more
solid particles are transported to the front and the sides, resulting in
solid-rich and mechanically strong frontal surge head, and lateral levees
followed by a weaker tail largely consisting of viscous fluid. The primary
frontal solid-rich surge head followed by secondary fluid-rich surges is the
consequence of phase-separation. Such typical and dominant phase-separation
phenomena are revealed for two-phase debris flow simulations. Finally, changes
in flow composition, that are explicitly considered by the new modelling
approach, result in significant changes of impact pressure estimates. These are
highly important in hazard assessment and mitigation planning and highlight the
application potential of the new approach.

dependence of the symmetry energy is conventionally expressed in the form of
the slope parameter L describing the derivative with respect to density of the
symmetry energy at saturation. Results deduced from nuclear structure and
heavy-ion reaction data are distributed around a mean value L=60 MeV.
  Recent studies have more thoroughly investigated the density range that a
particular observable is predominantly sensitive to. Two thirds of the
saturation density is a value typical for the information contained in
nuclear-structure data. Higher values exceeding saturation have been shown to
be probed with meson production and collective flows at incident energies in
the range of up to about 1 GeV/nucleon.
  From the measurement of the elliptic-flow ratio of neutrons with respect to
light charged particles in recent experiments at the GSI laboratory, a new more
stringent constraint for the symmetry energy at suprasaturation density has
been deduced. It confirms, with a considerably smaller uncertainty, the
moderately soft to linear density dependence of the symmetry energy previously
deduced from the FOPI-LAND data. Future opportunities offered by FAIR will be

which is assisted by competing one-electron processes involving sp2 and sp3

intense than the pi-like plasmon and more affected by one-electron processes
involving the sigma bands, with respect to the analogous collective oscillation
in monolayer graphene. At energies below 1eV, two extrinsic intraband modes are
predicted to occur, which are generated by distinct types of Dirac electrons
(associated with different Fermi velocities at the so-called Dirac points). The
most intense of them is a two-dimensional plasmon, having an energy-momentum
dispersion that resembles that of a two-dimensional electron gas. The other is
an acoustic plasmon that occurs for specific momentum directions and competes
with the two-dimensional plasmon at mid infrared energies. The strong
anisotropic character of this mode cannot be explained in terms of the widely
used Dirac-cone approximation. As in mono-, bi-, and few-layer graphene, the
extrinsic oscillations of silicene are highly sensitive to the concentration of

global challenge for the 21st Century both in terms of providing food for
humankind and to preserve the oceans ecosystems. However, fishing is a complex
economic activity, affected not just by overfishing but also by such factors as
pollution, technology, financial factors and more. For this reason, it is often
difficult to state with complete certainty that overfishing is the cause of the
decline of a fishery. In this study, we developed a simple dynamic model based
on the earlier, well-known Lotka-Volterra model or Prey-Predator model. To
describe exploitation patterns, we assume that the fish stock and the fishing
industry are coupled stock variables in the model and they dynamically affect
each other, with the fishing yield proportional to both the fishing capital and
the fish stock. The model is based on the concept that the fishing industry
acts as the predator of the resource and that its growth and subsequent decline
is directly related to the abundance of the fish stock. If the model can be fit
historical data relative to specific fisheries, then it is a strong indication
that the fishing industry is strongly affected by the magnitude of the fish
stock and that, in particular, the decline of the yield and the decline of the
stock are linked to each other. The model does not pretend to be a general
description of the fishing industry in all its varied forms; however, the data
reported here show that the model can indeed qualitatively describe several
historical case of the collapse of fisheries. The model can also be used as a
qualitative guide to understand the behavior of several other fisheries. These
result indicate that one of the main factors causing the present crisis of the
world's fisheries is the overexploitation of the fish stocks.

uncertainties are the $\rm 1\sigma$ error on the median. Our results are fully
consistent with the expected flattening of the redshift evolution from the

evolution assuming a universal, log-linear relation between SFR and gas mass
coupled to the redshift evolution of the specific star formation rate (sSFR) of
main sequence galaxies. While $\rm t_{dep.}$ shows only a mild dependence on
location within the MS, a clear trend of increasing $\rm \mu_{gas}$ across the
MS is observed (as known from previous studies). Further we comment on trends
within the MS and (in)consistencies with other studies.

uncertain. The core-degenerate (CD) scenario has been proposed as an
alternative way for the production of SNe Ia. In this scenario, SNe Ia are
formed at the final stage of common-envelope evolution from a merger of a
carbon-oxygen white dwarf (CO WD) with the CO core of an asymptotic giant
branch companion. However, the birthrates of SNe Ia from this scenario are
still not well determined. In this work, we performed a detailed investigation
on the CD scenario based on a binary population synthesis approach. The SN Ia
delay times from this scenario are basically in the range of 90Myr-2500Myr,
mainly contributing to the observed SNe Ia with short and intermediate delay
times although this scenario can also produce some old SNe Ia. Meanwhile, our
work indicates that the Galactic birthrates of SNe Ia from this scenario are no
more than 20% of total SNe Ia due to more careful treatment of mass transfer.
Although the SN Ia birthrates in the present work are lower than those in Ilkov
& Soker, the CD scenario cannot be ruled out as a viable mechanism for the
formation of SNe Ia. Especially, SNe Ia with circumstellar material from this
scenario contribute to 0.7-10% of total SNe Ia, which means that the CD
scenario can reproduce the observed birthrates of SNe Ia like PTF 11kx. We also
found that SNe Ia happen systemically earlier for a high value of metallicity
and their birthrates increase with metallicity.

base station (BS) and two half-duplex (HD) users, one user transmits on the
uplink channel and the other receives through the downlink channel on the same
frequency. The uplink user will generate inter-user interference (IUI) on the
downlink user through the interference channel. In this paper, we propose a
novel IUI suppression approach when the BS knows the full channel station
information. The main idea of the approach is to retransmit the weighted uplink
signal as soon as it has been received at the BS. For the narrowband case, we
first derive the closed-form expression of the optimum weighted coefficient
when the SI is perfectly cancelled at the BS and then analyze the performance
of the proposed IUI suppression approach in practical considerations.
Furthermore, the proposed IUI suppression approach can be extended to the
broadband case using a time-domain weighted filter. Simulation results shows
the advantage over existing IUI suppression schemes.

unconstrained images of people in-the-wild is a challenging task for computer
vision, especially when there is only limited training data from the wild
whilst most data available for model learning are captured in well-controlled
environments using fashion models (well lit, no background clutter, frontal
view, high-resolution). In this work, we develop a deep learning framework
capable of model transfer learning from well-controlled shop clothing images
collected from web retailers to in-the-wild images from the street.
Specifically, we formulate a novel Multi-Task Curriculum Transfer (MTCT) deep
learning method to explore multiple sources of different types of web
annotations with multi-labelled fine-grained attributes. Our multi-task loss
function is designed to extract more discriminative representations in training
by jointly learning all attributes, and our curriculum strategy exploits the
staged easy-to-complex transfer learning motivated by cognitive studies. We
demonstrate the advantages of the MTCT model over the state-of-the-art methods
on the X-Domain benchmark, a large scale clothing attribute dataset. Moreover,
we show that the MTCT model has a notable advantage over contemporary models
when the training data size is small.

Clerk Maxwell Telescope (JCMT) Gould Belt Legacy Survey (GBLS) with the SCUBA-2
instrument. We produce a catalogue of sources found by SCUBA-2, and separate
these into starless cores and protostars. We determine masses and densities for
each of our sources, using source temperatures determined by the Herschel Gould
Belt Survey. We compare the properties of starless cores in four different
molecular clouds: L1147/58, L1172/74, L1251 and L1228. We find that the core
mass functions for each region typically show shallower-than-Salpeter
behaviour. We find that L1147/58 and L1228 have a high ratio of starless cores
to Class II protostars, while L1251 and L1174 have a low ratio, consistent with
the latter regions being more active sites of current star formation, while the
former are forming stars less actively. We determine that, if modelled as
thermally-supported Bonnor-Ebert spheres, most of our cores have stable
configurations accessible to them. We estimate the external pressures on our
cores using archival $^{13}$CO velocity dispersion measurements and find that
our cores are typically pressure-confined, rather than gravitationally bound.
We perform a virial analysis on our cores, and find that they typically cannot
be supported against collapse by internal thermal energy alone, due primarily
to the measured external pressures. This suggests that the dominant mode of
internal support in starless cores in the Cepheus Flare is either non-thermal
motions or internal magnetic fields.

  analysis of Fermi-LAT"", defended on 1, December 2014",,,,"astro-ph.HE astro-ph.IM","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","  The study of Galactic Cosmic-ray electrons (CREs) saw important developments
in recent years, with the assumption of positron production only in interaction
of hadronic Cosmic-rays with interstellar matter challenged by new measurements
of CRE spectrum and related quantities. Indeed, all recent experiments seem to
confirm an hardening in the positrons, a feature that is totally in contrast
with the all-secondaries hypothesis, even if significant disagreements are
present about the CRE spectral behavior and the possible presence of spectral
features. Together with insufficient precision of current measurements, these
disagreements prevent the identification of the primary positron source, with
models involving Dark matter or astrophysical sources like Super Nova Remnants
and Pulsar Wind Nebula all able to explain current data.
  The fermi-LAT contribution to the CRE study was fundamental, with the 2009
measurement of the positron + electron spectrum extended to the 7 MeV - 1TeV
range with a statistics already exceeding previous results by many order of
magnitude; since then, the last statistic has largely increased, while the LAT
event reconstruction was significantly improved.
  In this article the reader will find an extensive and historical review of
the CRE science, a summary of the history of gamma astronomy before fermi, an
accurate description of the LAT and of its data analysis, a review of the
present knowledge about CRE spectrum and on the theories that try to explain
it, and finally a description of the changes and improvements introduced in the
LAT event reconstruction process at the beginning of 2015.

accelerated by magnetic reconnection. In our treatment, radiation is included
as an independent component, and two scenarios are considered. In the first
one, radiation cannot stream efficiently through the reconnection layer, while
the second scenario assumes that radiation is homogeneous in the striped wind.
We show how these two assumptions affect the dynamics. In particular, we find
that the asymptotic radial evolution of the Lorentz factor is not strongly
modified whether radiation can stream through the reconnection layer or not. On
the other hand, we show that the width, density and temperature of the
reconnection layer are strongly dependent on these assumptions. We then apply
the model to the gamma-ray burst context and find that photons cannot diffuse
efficiently through the reconnection layer below radius $r_{\rm D}^{\Delta}
\sim 10^{10.5}$ cm, which is about an order of magnitude below the photospheric
radius. Above $r_{\rm D}^{\Delta}$, the dynamics asymptotes to the solution of
the scenario in which radiation can stream through the reconnection layer. As a
result, the density of the current sheet increases sharply, providing efficient
photon production by the Bremsstrahlung process which could have profound

are uninformative. The case where the two communities have approximately the
same size has been extensively studied and we concentrate here on the community
detection problem in the case of unbalanced communities. In this setting,
spectral algorithms based on the non-backtracking matrix are known to solve the
community detection problem (i.e. do strictly better than a random guess) when
the signal is sufficiently large namely above the so-called Kesten Stigum
threshold. In this regime and when the average degree tends to infinity, we
show that if the community of a vanishing fraction of the vertices is revealed,
then a local algorithm (belief propagation) is optimal down to Kesten Stigum
threshold and we quantify explicitly its performance. Below the Kesten Stigum
threshold, we show that, in the large degree limit, there is a second threshold
called the spinodal curve below which, the community detection problem is not
solvable. The spinodal curve is equal to the Kesten Stigum threshold when the
fraction of vertices in the smallest community is above
$p^*=\frac{1}{2}-\frac{1}{2\sqrt{3}}$, so that the Kesten Stigum threshold is
the threshold for solvability of the community detection in this case. However
when the smallest community is smaller than $p^*$, the spinodal curve only
provides a lower bound on the threshold for solvability. In the regime below
the Kesten Stigum bound and above the spinodal curve, we also characterize the
performance of best local algorithms as a function of the fraction of revealed
vertices. Our proof relies on a careful analysis of the associated
reconstruction problem on trees which might be of independent interest. In

between the phase behavior and crystallization characteristics with the
relative composition of A- and B-polymer in the system. We report simulation
results for non-isothermal and isothermal crystallization with weak and strong
segregation strength to elucidate the composition dependent crystallization
behavior. With increasing composition of low melting B-polymer, macrophase
separation and crystallization temperature changes non-monotonically, which is
attributed to the change in diffusivity of both the polymers with increasing
composition of B-polymer. In weak segregation strength, however, at high enough
composition of B-polymer, A-polymer yields relatively thicker crystals, which
is attributed to the dilution effect exhibited by B-polymer. When B-polymer
composition is high enough, it acts like a solvent while A-polymer
crystallizes. Under this situation, A-polymer segments become more mobile and
less facile to crystallize. As a result, A-polymer crystallizes at a relative
low temperature with the formation of thicker crystals. At strong segregation
strength, dilution effect is accompanied with the strong A-B repulsive
interaction, which is reflected in non-monotonic trend of mean square radius of
gyration with increasing composition of B-polymer. Isothermal crystallization
reveals a strong relationship between composition and crystallization behavior.
Two-step (viz., sequential crystallization) yields better crystals than
one-step (viz., coincident crystallization) for both the polymers.

immersive representations of the 3D world. And one of the emerging technologies
are light field (LF) cameras based on micro-lens arrays. To record the
directional information of the light rays, a much larger storage space and
transmission bandwidth are required by a LF image as compared with a
conventional 2D image of similar spatial dimension, and the compression of LF
data becomes a vital part of its application.
  In this paper, we propose a LF codec that fully exploits the intrinsic
geometry between the LF sub-views by first approximating the LF with disparity
guided sparse coding over a perspective shifted light field dictionary. The
sparse coding is only based on several optimized Structural Key Views (SKV);
however the entire LF can be recovered from the coding coefficients. By keeping
the approximation identical between encoder and decoder, only the residuals of
the non-key views, disparity map and the SKVs need to be compressed into the
bit stream. An optimized SKV selection method is proposed such that most LF
spatial information could be preserved. And to achieve optimum dictionary
efficiency, the LF is divided into several Coding Regions (CR), over which the
reconstruction works individually. Experiments and comparisons have been
carried out over benchmark LF dataset, which show that the proposed SC-SKV
codec produces convincing compression results in terms of both rate-distortion
performance and visual quality compared with High Efficiency Video Coding
(HEVC): with 47.87% BD-rate reduction and 1.59 dB BD-PSNR improvement achieved

asymmetry in the viscosity of the inner and outer fluid medium. First we
explore the stability of the vesicle free energy which includes a coupling
between the membrane curvature and the local density difference between the two
monolayers. Two types of instabilities are identified: a small wavelength
instability and a larger wavelength instability. Considering the bulk fluid
viscosity and the inter-monolayer friction as the dissipation sources, we next
employ Onsager's variational principle to derive the coupled equations both for
the membrane and the bulk fluid. The three relaxation modes are coupled to each
other due to the bilayer and the spherical structure of the vesicle. Most
importantly, a higher fluid viscosity inside the vesicle shifts the cross-over
mode between the bending and the slipping to a larger value. As the vesicle
parameters approach toward the unstable regions, the relaxation dynamics is
dramatically slowed down, and the corresponding mode structure changes
significantly. In some limiting cases, our general result reduces to the
previously obtained relaxation rates.

filtering problems in large-scale geophysical applications are particularly
challenging for the Particle Filter (PF). Approximate but efficient methods

key element of these approximate methods is localization, which is in principle
a general technique to avoid the curse of dimensionality and consists in
limiting the influence of observations to neighboring sites. However, while it
works effectively with the EnKF, localization introduces harmful
discontinuities in the estimated physical fields when applied blindly to the
PF. In the present paper, we explore two possible local algorithms based on the
EnKPF, a hybrid method combining the EnKF and the PF. A simulation study in a
conjugate normal setup allows to highlight the trade-offs involved when
applying localization to PF type of algorithms in the high-dimensional setting.
Experiments with the Lorenz96 model demonstrate the ability of the local EnKPF
algorithms to perform well even with a small number of particles compared to

extreme quantiles of compound loss distributions (frequency+severity) as are

Interpolated Single Loss Approximation (ISLA) of Opdyke (2014) is based on the
widely used Single Loss Approximation (SLA) of Degen (2010) and maintains two
important advantages over its competitors: first, ISLA correctly accounts for a
discontinuity in SLA that otherwise can systematically and notably bias the
quantile (capital) approximation under conditions of both finite and infinite
mean. Secondly, because it is based on a closed-form approximation, ISLA
maintains the notable speed advantages of SLA over other methods requiring
algorithmic looping (e.g. fast Fourier transform or Panjer recursion). Speed is
important when simulating many quantile (capital) estimates, as is so often
required in practice, and essential when simulations of simulations are needed
(e.g. some power studies). The modified ISLA (MISLA) presented herein increases
the range of application across the severity distributions most commonly used
in these settings, and it is tested against extensive Monte Carlo simulation
(one billion years' worth of losses) and the best competing method (the
perturbative expansion (PE2) of Hernandez et al., 2014) using twelve
heavy-tailed severity distributions, some of which are truncated. MISLA is
shown to be comparable to PE2 in terms of both speed and accuracy, and it is
arguably more straightforward to implement for the majority of Advanced
Measurement Approaches (AMA) banks that are already using SLA (and failing to
take into account its biasing discontinuity).

to reduce congestion in the backbone of cellular networks and to improve
Quality of Service. From a network point of view, the goal is to offload as

offloading can lead to an unbalanced user association. Some wireless nodes can
be overloaded by cache-related traffic while the resources of others remain
underused. Given a fixed content placement, this work proposes an efficient
distributed algorithm to control and balance the association of cache-related

achieve the globally optimal solution and can be executed on base stations
using a limited amount of information exchange between them. It is based on a

over a shared communication network. Each control loop is described by a
linear-time-invariant (LTI) system with an event-triggered implementation. We
assume the network can be used by at most one control loop at any time instant
and after each controller update, a pre-defined channel occupancy time elapses
before the network is available. In our framework we offer the scheduler two
options to avoid conflicts: using the event-triggering mechanism, where the
scheduler can choose the triggering coefficient; or forcing controller updates
at an earlier pre-defined time. Our objective is avoiding communication
conflict while guaranteeing stability of all control loops. We formulate the
original scheduling problem as a control synthesis problem over a network of
timed game automata (NTGA) with a safety objective. The NTGA is obtained by
taking the parallel composition of the timed game automata (TGA) associated
with the network and with all control loops. The construction of TGA associated
with control loops leverages recent results on the abstraction of timing models
of event-triggered LTI systems. In our problem, the safety objective is to
avoid that update requests from a control loop happen while the network is in
use by another task. We showcase the results in some examples.

present a remarkably high level of chromospheric activity, even comparable with

  Arising from Different Clock Frequencies",,,,,"cs.IT math.IT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In digital communication systems different clock frequencies of transmitter
and receiver usually is translated into cycle slips. Receivers might experience
different sampling frequencies from transmitter due to manufacturing
imperfection, Doppler Effect introduced by channel or wrong estimation of
symbol rate. Timing synchronization in presence of cycle slip for a burst
sequence of received information, leads to severe degradation in system
performance that represents as shortening or prolonging of bit stream. Therefor
the necessity of prior detection and elimination of cycle slip is unavoidable.
Accordingly, the main idea introduced in this paper is to employ the Gardner
Detector (GAD) not only to recover a fixed timing offset, its output is also
processed in a way such that timing drifts can be estimated and corrected.
Deriving a two steps algorithm, eliminates the cycle slips arising from wrong
estimation of symbol rate firstly, and then iteratively synchronize symbol
timing of a burst received signal by applying GAD to a feed forward structure
with the additional benefits that convergence and stability problems are
avoided, as they are typical for feedback schemes normally used by GAD. The
proposed algorithm is able to compensate considerable symbol rate offsets at
the receiver side. Considerable results in terms of BER confirm the algorithm
proficiency.

fields of stars over a large range of spectral types, rotation periods and

its activity cycle. In this paper, we examine the magnetic properties of stars
with existing chromospherically determined cycle periods. Previous authors have
suggested that cycle periods lie on multiple branches, either in the cycle
period-Rossby number plane or the cycle period-rotation period plane. We find
some evidence that stars along the active branch show significant average
toroidal fields that exhibit large temporal variations while stars exclusively
on the inactive branch remain dominantly poloidal throughout their entire
cycle. This lends credence to the idea that different shear layers are in
operation along each branch. There is also evidence that the short magnetic
polarity switches observed on some stars are characteristic of the inactive
branch while the longer chromospherically determined periods are characteristic
of the active branch. This may explain the discrepancy between the magnetic and
chromospheric cycle periods found on some stars. These results represent a
first attempt at linking global magnetic field properties obtained form ZDI and

corresponding positive or negative marginal utilities. We find that the
division of mixed items boils down, normatively as well as computationally, to

task of dividing the non disposable items must be either good news for

waves with appropriate relative amplitude and phase. Nearly 1000 times in the
modulation of output power has been demonstrated by changing the relative phase
of the incident waves over 180{\deg}. We further demonstrate that these
scatterers are sensitive devices to detect the small differences between two
nearly equal incident waves. A 27 % change in the strength of the scattering
wave has been demonstrated for every degree of phase deviation from the optimum
condition between the incident waves.

as Twitter for situational awareness during the emerging disasters is discovery
of the disaster-related postings. Given the wide range of possible disasters,
using a pre-selected set of disaster-related keywords for the discovery is
suboptimal. An alternative that we focus on in this work is to train a
classifier using a small set of labeled postings that are becoming available as
a disaster is emerging. Our hypothesis is that utilizing large quantities of
historical microblogs could improve the quality of classification, as compared
to training a classifier only on the labeled data. We propose to use unlabeled
microblogs to cluster words into a limited number of clusters and use the word
clusters as features for classification. To evaluate the proposed
semi-supervised approach, we used Twitter data from 6 different disasters. Our
results indicate that when the number of labeled tweets is 100 or less, the
proposed approach is superior to the standard classification based on the bag
or words feature representation. Our results also reveal that the choice of the
unlabeled corpus, the choice of word clustering algorithm, and the choice of
hyperparameters can have a significant impact on the classification accuracy.

become more and more 3D, eventually forming a 'collapsed' tetragonal phase,
where the distance between CoAs layers is markedly reduced. The observed
periodicity of the 3D electronic structure matches in each case that expected
from the distance between the planes in the bulk. However, the electronic
structure is better fitted by a calculation corresponding to a slab with 2 CoAs
layers than to the bulk structure. We attribute this to subtle modifications of
the 2D electronic structure induced by the truncation of the 3D dispersion at
the surface in the ARPES measurement. We further study how this affects the
electronic properties. We show that, despite this distortion, the electronic
structure of CaCo2As2 is essentially that expected for a collapsed phase.
Electronic correlations produce a renormalization of the electronic structure
by a factor 1.4, which is not affected by the transition to the collapsed
state. On the other hand, a small shift of the Fermi level reduces the density
of states in the eg bands and suppresses the magnetic transition expected in
CaCo2As2. Our study evidences that observing the bulk periodicity is not
sufficient to ensure bulk sensitivity. It further gives direct information on
the role of 3D interactions, mostly governed by Co-As hybridization, among eg
and t2g orbitals. It is also useful to better understand the electronic
structure of Fe superconductors and the range of validity of ARPES

has the same structure as the one of atomic hydrogen with the Coulomb potential
expressed in terms of a hyperradius and the nuclear charge replaced by an angle
dependent effective charge. The simplest spectral approach consists in
expanding the hyperangular wave function in a basis of hyperspherical
harmonics. This expansion however, is known to be very slowly converging.
Instead, we introduce new hyperangular sturmian functions. These functions do
not have an analytical expression but they treat the first term of the
multipole expansion of the electron-electron interaction potential, namely the
radial electron correlation, exactly. The properties of these new functions are
discussed in detail. For the basis functions of the hyperradius, several
choices are possible. In the present case, we use Coulomb sturmian functions of
half integer angular momentum. We show that, in the case of H$^-$, the accuracy
of the energy and the width of the resonance states obtained through a single
diagonalization of the Hamiltonian, is comparable to the values given by
state-of-the-art methods while using a much smaller basis set. In addition, we
show that precise values of the electric-dipole oscillator strengths for
$S\rightarrow P$ transitions in helium are obtained thereby confirming the
accuracy of the bound state wave functions generated with the present method.

distortion induces directionality in heat transport. Using Fourier's law, we
also compute diffusive heat transport for the same geometries obtaining
significantly smaller anisotropicity, revealing the crucial role of phonon-size

from the traditional temporal heterodyne detection technique in which hundreds

significantly reducing sampling rate and increasing the signal to noise ratio

chips based on a new concept for implementing strong Physical Unclonable
Function (PUF) on field programmable gate arrays (FPGA). Its qualitatively
novel feature is a remote reconfiguration in which the delay stages of the PUF
are arranged to a random pattern within a subset of the FPGA's gates. Before
the reconfiguration is performed during authentication the PUF simply does not
exist. Hence even if an attacker has the chip under control previously she can
gain no useful information about the PUF. This feature, together with a strict
renunciation of any error correction and challenge selection criteria that
depend on individual properties of the PUF that goes into the field make our
strong PUF construction immune to all machine learning attacks presented in the
literature. More sophisticated attacks on our strong-PUF construction will be
difficult, because they require the attacker to learn or directly measure the
properties of the complete FPGA. A fully functional reference implementation
for a secure ""chip biometrics"" is presented. We remotely configure ten 64-stage
arbiter PUFs out of 1428 lookup tables within a time of 25 seconds and then
receive one ""fingerprint"" from each PUF within 1 msec.

  L1-Penalized Linear Regression",,,,,"stat.ME q-bio.GN","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) is becoming increasingly popular for quantifying
gene expression levels. Since the RNA-seq measurements are relative in nature,
between-sample normalization of counts is an essential step in differential
expression (DE) analysis. The normalization of existing DE detection algorithms
is ad hoc and performed once for all prior to DE detection, which may be
suboptimal since ideally normalization should be based on non-DE genes only and
thus coupled with DE detection. We propose a unified statistical model for
joint normalization and DE detection of log-transformed RNA-seq data.
Sample-specific normalization factors are modeled as unknown parameters in the
gene-wise linear models and jointly estimated with the regression coefficients.
By imposing sparsity-inducing L1 penalty (or mixed L1/L2-norm for multiple
treatment conditions) on the regression coefficients, we formulate the problem
as a penalized least-squares regression problem and apply the augmented
lagrangian method to solve it. Simulation studies show that the proposed model
and algorithms outperform existing methods in terms of detection power and
false-positive rate when more than half of the genes are differentially
expressed and/or when the up- and down-regulated genes among DE genes are
unbalanced in amount.

invoked to explain explosive energy release and particle acceleration. However,
the timescales involved in classical models within the macroscopic MHD regime

instability by performing visco-resistive two-dimensional numerical simulations
of the evolution of thin current sheets, for a variety of initial
configurations and of values of the Lunquist number $S$, up to $10^7$. Results
confirm that when the critical aspect ratio of $S^{1/3}$ is reached in the
reconnecting current sheets, the instability proceeds on ideal (Alfv\'enic)
macroscopic timescales, as required to explain observations. Moreover, the same
scaling is seen to apply also to the local, secondary reconnection events
triggered during the nonlinear phase of the tearing instability, thus
accelerating the cascading process to increasingly smaller spatial and temporal
scales. The process appears to be robust, as the predicted scaling is measured
both in inviscid simulations and when using a Prandtl number $P=1$ in the
viscous regime.

phases. They are characterized by a topological invariant and can be identified
by the presence of protected edge states. In this article, we show that a local
impurity in a Chern insulator induces a twofold response: bound states that
carry a chiral current and a net current circulating around the impurity. This
is a manifestation of broken time symmetry and persists even for an
infinitesimal impurity potential. To illustrate this, we consider a Coulomb
impurity in the Haldane model. Working in the low-energy long-wavelength limit,
we show that an infinitesimal impurity strength suffices to create bound
states. We find analytic wavefunctions for the bound states and show that they
carry a circulating current. In contrast, in the case of a trivial analogue,
graphene with a gap induced by a sublattice potential, bound states occur but
carry no current. In the many body problem of the Haldane model at
half-filling, we use a linear response approach to demonstrate a circulating
current around the impurity. Impurity textures in insulators are generally
expected to decay exponentially; in contrast, this current decays polynomially
with distance from the impurity. Going beyond the Haldane model, we consider
the case of coexisting trivial and non-trivial masses. We find that the
impurity induces a local chiral current as long as time reversal symmetry is
broken. However, the decay of this local current bears a signature of the
overall topology - the current decays polynomially in a non-trivial system and
exponentially in a trivial system. In all cases, our analytic results agree
well with numerical tight-binding simulations.

play a large part in our everyday lives. They dictate how and with whom a
certain individual will interact. One of such interactions can be termed
""avoidance control"". This everyday situation occurs when two fast-walking
persons suddenly realize that they are on a frontal collision course and begin
maneuvering to avoid collision. If the two walkers' initial maneuverings are in
the same direction that can lead to oscillations that lengthen time required to
reach a stable avoidance trajectory. We introduce a dynamical model with a
feedback loop to understand the origin and properties of this oscillation. For
the emergence of the oscillatory behavior, two conditions must be satisfied: i)
the persons must initiate the avoidance maneuver in the same direction; ii) the
time delays in the feedback loop must reverse the phase of the players'
positions at the oscillation frequency. The oscillation can be terminated at
any time if one of the walkers decides to stop and/or to communicate. By taking
over the control of the situation the walker cuts the feedback loop. Similar
oscillatory situations may potentially cause major collisions between
autonomous vehicles and airplanes with airborne communications, but in
autopilot mode.

  cosmological implications",,,,,"physics.gen-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The modern view, that there exists a preferred frame of reference related to
the cosmic microwave background (CMB), is in apparent contradiction with the
principles of special relativity. The purpose of the present study is to
develop a counterpart of the special relativity theory that is consistent with
the existence of a preferred frame but, like the standard relativity theory, is
based on the relativity principle and universality of the (\textit{two-way})
speed of light. In the framework developed, a degree of anisotropy of the
one-way velocity acquires meaning of a characteristic of the really existing
anisotropy caused by motion of an inertial frame relative to the preferred
frame. The anisotropic special relativity kinematics is developed based on the
first principles: (1) Space-time transformations between inertial frames leave
the equation of anisotropic light propagation invariant and (2) A set of the
transformations possesses a group structure. The Lie group theory apparatus is
applied to define groups of space-time transformations between inertial frames.
Applying the consequences of the transformations to the problem of calculating
the CMB temperature distribution yields an equation in which the angular
dependence coincides with that obtained on the basis of the standard relativity
theory but the mean temperature is corrected by the terms second order in the
observer velocity. From conceptual point of view, it eliminates the
inconsistency of the usual approach when formulas of the standard special
relativity are applied to define effects caused by motion with respect to the
preferred frame.

accurate numerics for the next orders after extrapolation on $M$ and $\gamma$.
The coefficient of $\gamma^{5/2}$ in the expansion is found approximately equal

equation, which is a partial differential equation that describes how the
quantum state of a non-relativistic physical system changes with time. In
classic world is named frequency in time (FIT), which is presented here in
opposition and as a complement of traditional spectral analysis
frequency-dependent based on Fourier theory. Besides, FIT is a metric, which
assesses the impact of the flanks of a signal on its frequency spectrum, which
is not taken into account by Fourier theory and even less in real time. Even
more, and unlike all derived tools from Fourier Theory (i.e., continuous,
discrete, fast, short-time, fractional and quantum Fourier Transform, as well
as, Gabor) FIT has the following advantages: a) compact support with excellent
energy output treatment, b) low computational cost, O(N) for signals and O(N2)
for images, c) it does not have phase uncertainties (indeterminate phase for
magnitude = 0) as Discrete and Fast Fourier Transform (DFT, FFT, respectively),
d) among others. In fact, FIT constitutes one side of a triangle (which from
now on is closed) and it consists of the original signal in time, spectral
analysis based on Fourier Theory and FIT. Thus a toolbox is completed, which it
is essential for all applications of Digital Signal Processing (DSP) and
Digital Image Processing (DIP); and, even, in the latter, FIT allows edge
detection (which is called flank detection in case of signals), denoising,
despeckling, compression, and superresolution of still images. Such
applications include signals intelligence and imagery intelligence. On the
other hand, we will present other DIP tools, which are also derived from the
Schrodinger equation.
