connected to infinite bus (SMIB) power system by using static compensator
(STATCOM). The gains of Proportional-Integral-Derivative (PID) controller in
STATCOM are being optimized by heuristic technique based on Particle swarm
optimization (PSO). Further, Bacterial Foraging Optimization (BFO) as an
alternative heuristic method is also applied to select optimal gains of PID
controller. The performance of STATCOM with the above soft-computing techniques
are studied and compared with the conventional PID controller under various
scenarios. The simulation results are accompanied with performance indices
based quantitative analysis. The analysis clearly signifies the robustness of
the new scheme in terms of stability and voltage regulation when compared with

locality-preserving properties and easy implementation for many applications.
However, Hilbert did not describe how to generalize his construction to higher
dimensions. In fact, the number of ways in which this may be done ranges from
zero to infinite, depending on what properties of the Hilbert curve one
considers to be essential.
  In this work we take the point of view that a Hilbert curve should at least
be self-similar and traverse cubes octant by octant. We organize and explore
the space of possible three-dimensional Hilbert curves and the potentially
useful properties which they may have. We discuss a notation system that allows
us to distinguish the curves from one another and enumerate them. This system
has been implemented in a software prototype, available from the author's
website. Several examples of possible three-dimensional Hilbert curves are
presented, including a curve that visits the points on most sides of the unit
cube in the order of the two-dimensional Hilbert curve; curves of which not
only the eight octants are similar to each other, but also the four quarters; a
curve with excellent locality-preserving properties and endpoints that are not
vertices of the cube; a curve in which all but two octants are each other's
images with respect to reflections in axis-parallel planes; and curves that can
be sketched on a grid without using vertical line segments. In addition, we
discuss several four-dimensional Hilbert curves.

in the cloud so that the customer's risk is minimized, while at the same time
ensuring that the provider accrues his fair share. We do this by correlating
the revenue stream of the customer to the prices charged by the provider. We
show that our mechanism is incentive compatible in that it is in the best
interest of the customer to provide his true revenue as a function of the
resources rented. We next add another restriction to the price function, i.e.,
that it be linear. This removes the distortion that creeps in when the customer
has to pay more money for less resources. Our algorithms for both the schemes

various galaxy surveys we test the performance of the current cosmological
models at the perturbation level while either marginalizing over $\sigma_8$ or
having it as a free parameter. As a result, we find that at a statistical
level, i.e. after considering the best-fit $\chi^2$ or the value of the Akaike
information criterion, most models are in very good agreement with the growth
rate data and are practically indistinguishable from $\Lambda$CDM. However,
when we also consider the internal consistency of the models by comparing the
theoretically predicted values of $(\gamma_0, \gamma_1)$, i.e. the value of the
growth index $\gamma(z)$ and its derivative today, with the best-fit ones, we
find that the predictions of three out of ten dark energy models are in mild
tension with the best-fit ones when $\sigma_8$ is marginalized over. When
$\sigma_8$ is free we find that most models are not only in mild tension, but
also predict low values for $\sigma_8$. This could be attributed to either a
systematic problem with the growth-rate data or the emergence of new physics at
low redshifts, with the latter possibly being related to the well-known issue
of the lack of power at small scales. Finally, by utilizing mock data based on
an LSST-like survey we show that with future surveys and by using the growth
index parameterization, it will be possible to resolve the issue of the low

probed by a weak electromagnetic field of different frequency. We show that the
optical properties of the system and the dispersion of the plasmons are

reduce data-related computation. Our approach can fit risk scores in a way that
scales linearly in the number of samples, provides a certificate of optimality,

complex-valued energy states, are solved by introducing a small photon mass,
orders of magnitude below current experimental bounds. We explicitly construct
a covariant basis of polarization vectors, in which the photon field can be
expanded. We proceed to derive the Feynman propagator and show that the theory
is microcausal. Despite the occurrence of negative energies and
vacuum-Cherenkov radiation, we do not find any runaway stability issues,
because the energy remains bounded from below. An important observation is that
the ordering of the roots of the dispersion relations is the same in any
observer frame, which allows for a frame-independent condition that selects the
correct branch of the dispersion relation. This turns out to be critical for
the consistency of the quantization. To our knowledge, this is the first system
for which quantization has consistently been performed, in spite of the fact
that the theory contains negative energies in some observer frames.

visible color images, according to physical scattering models, e.g., Rayleigh
or Mie models. However, there exist serious discrepancies in brightness and
image structures between the near-infrared gray images and the visible color
images. The direct use of the near-infrared gray images brings about another
color distortion problem in the dehazed images. Therefore, the color distortion
should also be considered for near-infrared dehazing. To reflect this point,
this paper presents an approach of adding a new color regularization to
conventional dehazing framework. The proposed color regularization can model
the color prior for unknown haze-free images from two captured images. Thus,
natural-looking colors and fine details can be induced on the dehazed images.
The experimental results show that the proposed color regularization model can
help remove the color distortion and the haze at the same time. Also, the
effectiveness of the proposed color regularization is verified by comparing
with other conventional regularizations. It is also shown that the proposed
color regularization can remove the edge artifacts which arise from the use of
the conventional dark prior model.

have attracted significant attention. Different from the existing research, we
investigate the throughput and energy efficiency of a general class of
multiple-input and multiple-output systems with arbitrary inputs when they are
subject to statistical quality-of-service (QoS) constraints, which are imposed
as limits on the delay violation and buffer overflow probabilities. We employ
the effective capacity as the performance metric. We obtain the optimal input
covariance matrix that maximizes the effective capacity under a short-term
average power constraint. Following that, we perform an asymptotic analysis of
the effective capacity in the low signal-to-noise ratio and large-scale antenna
regimes. In the low signal-to-noise ratio regime analysis, we utilize the first
and second derivatives of the effective capacity when the signal-to-noise ratio
approaches zero in order to determine the minimum energy-per-bit and also the
slope of the effective capacity versus energy-per-bit curve at the minimum
energy-per-bit. We observe that the minimum energy-per-bit is independent of
the input distribution, whereas the slope depends on the input distribution. In
the large-scale antenna analysis, we show that the effective capacity
approaches the average transmission rate in the channel with the increasing
number of transmit and/or receive antennas. Particularly, the gap between the
effective capacity and the average transmission rate in the channel, which is
caused by the QoS constraints, is minimized with the number of antennas. In
addition, we put forward the non-asymptotic backlog and delay violation bounds
by utilizing the effective capacity. Finally, we substantiate our analytical
results through numerical illustrations.

selective CT imaging at lowest patient dose but it suffers from suboptimal
count rate. A dynamic beam attenuator (DBA) can help with count rate by
modulating x-ray beam intensity such that the low attenuating areas of the
patient receive lower exposure, and detector behind these areas is not
overexposed. However, DBA may harden the beam and cause artifacts and errors.
This work investigates positive and negative effects of using DBA in PCCT.
Methods: A simple PCCT with single energy bin, spectroscopic PCCT with 2 and 5
energy bins, and conventional energy integrating CT with and without DBA were
simulated and investigated using 120kVp tube voltage and 14mGy air dose. The
DBAs were modeled as made from soft tissue (ST) equivalent material, iron (Fe),
and holmium (Ho) K-edge material. A cylindrical CT phantom and chest phantom
with iodine and CaCO3 contrast elements were used. Image artifacts and
quantification errors in general and material decomposed CT were determined.
Results: Simple PCCT exhibited major image artifacts and quantification errors
when DBAs were used. The artifacts and errors were decreased with 2bin
spectroscopic PCCT and nearly eliminated with 5bin spectroscopic CT. The photon
starvation noise did present with Fe-DBA due to strong absorption of lower
energy photons. The 5bin PCCT with ST-DBA and Ho-DBA were nearly free of
artifacts and photon starvation noise. The Ho-DBA better preserved low energy
photons and decreased beam hardening artifacts, and improved material
decomposition. Also, the Ho-DBA was also miniature having 1.4mm thickness and
2cm length, much smaller than Fe-DBA. Conclusion: DBA fabricated from K-edge
material such as Ho can address count rate problem of PCCT and provide
miniature size, minimal image artifacts, and improved material decomposition at
lowest patient dose.

all transaction activities conducted by customers for a whole city in addition
to the location of stores dispersed in the city. This approach enables us to
uncover not only simple linked trips such as transition movements between
stores but also the edge weight for each linked trip in the specific district.
Thus, the proposed methodology can complement conventional research methods.
Enhancing understanding of people's shopping behaviors could be useful for city
authorities and urban practitioners for effective urban management. The results
also help individual retailers to rearrange their services by accommodating the

can automate the abstract screening process is of huge importance. Several
methods have been proposed for this task. However, it is very hard to clearly

because of the following challenges: (1) the use of non-overlapping metrics for
the evaluation of the proposed methods, (2) usage of features that are very
hard to collect, (3) using a small set of reviews for the evaluation, and (4)
no solid statistical testing or equivalence grouping of the methods. In this
paper, we use feature representation that can be extracted per citation. We
evaluate SVM-based methods (commonly used) on a large set of reviews ($61$) and
metrics ($11$) to provide equivalence grouping of methods based on a solid
statistical test. Our analysis also includes a strong variability of the
metrics using $500$x$2$ cross validation. While some methods shine for
different metrics and for different datasets, there is no single method that
dominates the pack. Furthermore, we observe that in some cases relevant

from Li to Eu in a sample of stars uniformly distributed over the $-2.62 \le$
[Fe/H] $\le +0.24$ metallicity range that is suitable for the Galactic chemical
evolution research. The star sample has been kinematically selected to trace
the Galactic thin and thick disks and halo. We find new and improve earlier
results as follows. (i) The element-to-iron ratios for Mg, Si, Ca, and Ti form
a MP plateau at a similar height of 0.3~dex, and the knee occurs at common
[Fe/H] $\simeq -0.8$. The knee at the same metallicity is observed for [O/Fe],
and the MP plateau is formed at [O/Fe] = 0.61. (ii) The upward trend of [C/O]
with decreasing metallicity exists at [Fe/H] $< -1.2$, supporting the earlier
finding of Akerman et al. (iii) An underabundance of Na relative to Mg in the
[Fe/H] $< -1$ stars is nearly constant, with the mean [Na/Mg] $\simeq -0.5$.
(iv) The K/Sc, Ca/Sc, and Ti/Sc ratios form well-defined trends, suggesting a
common site of the K-Ti production. (v) Sr follows the Fe abundance down to
[Fe/H] $\simeq -2.5$, while Zr is enhanced in MP stars. (vi) The comparisons of
our results with some widely used Galactic evolution models are given. The use
of the NLTE element abundances raises credit to the interpretation of the data
in the context of the chemical evolution of the Galaxy.

  Systems",,,,,"stat.AP physics.ao-ph physics.data-an","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF) is a data assimilation technique that uses
an ensemble of models, updated with data, to track the time evolution of a
usually non-linear system. It does so by using an empirical approximation to
the well-known Kalman filter. However, its performance can suffer when the
ensemble size is smaller than the state space, as is often necessary for
computationally burdensome models. This scenario means that the empirical
estimate of the state covariance is not full rank and possibly quite noisy. To
solve this problem in this high dimensional regime, we propose a
computationally fast and easy to implement algorithm called the penalized
ensemble Kalman filter (PEnKF). Under certain conditions, it can be
theoretically proven that the PEnKF will be accurate (the estimation error will
converge to zero) despite having fewer ensemble members than state dimensions.
Further, as contrasted to localization methods, the proposed approach learns
the covariance structure associated with the dynamical system. These
theoretical results are supported with simulations of several non-linear and
high dimensional systems.

cover two cases, where $A_t$ is Gaussian or a subset of rows of the identity

The proliferation of text networks such as hyperlinked webpages and academic

paper, we address the problem of text network exploration through constructing
a heterogeneous web of topics, which allows people to investigate a text
network associating word level with document level. To achieve this, a
probabilistic generative model for text and links is proposed, where three
different relationships in the heterogeneous topic web are quantified. We also
develop a prototype demo system named TopicAtlas to exhibit such heterogeneous
topic web, and demonstrate how this system can facilitate the task of text
network exploration. Extensive qualitative analyses are included to verify the
effectiveness of this heterogeneous topic web. Besides, we validate our model
on real-life text networks, showing that it preserves good performance on
objective evaluation metrics.

Furthermore, we extend our calculations to the thermal phase and find that for
a time-independent Hamiltonian, the OTO correlators also appear to vanish as a

models phenomena from blistering to liquid crystals. The zero energy states of
the Aviles-Giga functional have been characterized by Jabin, Otto, Perthame.
Among other results they showed that if $\lim_{n\rightarrow \infty}
I_{\epsilon_n}(u_n)=0$ for some sequence $u_n\in W^{2,2}_0(\Omega)$ and
$u=\lim_{n\rightarrow \infty} u_n$ then $\nabla u$ is Lipschitz continuous
outside a locally finite set. This is essentially a corollary to their theorem
that if $u$ is a solution to the Eikonal equation $\left|\nabla u\right|=1$
a.e. and if for every ""entropy"" $\Phi$ function $u$ satisfies
$\nabla\cdot\left[\Phi(\nabla u^{\perp})\right]=0$ distributionally in $\Omega$
then $\nabla u$ is locally Lipschitz continuous outside a locally finite set.
  In this paper we generalize this result by showing that if $\Omega$ is
bounded and simply connected, $u$ satisfies the Eikonal equation and if
  \begin{equation}
  \label{eqi88}
  \nabla\cdot\left(\Sigma_{e_1 e_2}(\nabla
u^{\perp})\right)=0\text{and}\nabla\cdot\left(\Sigma_{\epsilon_1
\epsilon_2}(\nabla u^{\perp})\right)=0\text{distributionally in}\Omega,
  \end{equation} where $\Sigma_{e_1 e_2}$ and $\Sigma_{\epsilon_1 \epsilon_2}$
are the entropies introduced by Ambrosio, DeLellis, Mantegazza, Jin, Kohn, then
$\nabla u$ is locally Lipschitz continuous outside a locally finite set.

contributions to Juno's measured gravitational coefficients similar to or
larger than those expected from shallow zonal winds (extending to depths less

represented by a level-set function that evolves during the inversion. We
choose radial basis functions to represent the level-set function, leading to
an optimization problem with a modest number of parameters. A common problem
with level-set methods is to fine tune the width of the level-set boundary for
optimal sensitivity. We propose a robust algorithm that dynamically adapts the
width of the level-set boundary to ensure faster convergence. Tests on a suite

modest amount of noise. We also extend the method to joint inversion of both

decision to exercise options within a given netting set. This is true for both
unsecured trades and secured / cleared trades where KVA and MVA play a material
role even if CVA and FVA do not. However, this effect has frequently been
ignored in XVA models and indeed in exercise decisions made by option owners.

systems in the presence of non-Gaussian noise have induced a new methodology
called the maximum correntropy filtering. The filters designed under the
maximum correntropy criterion (MCC) utilize a similarity measure (or
correntropy) between two random variables as a cost function. They are shown to
improve the estimators' robustness against outliers or impulsive noises. In
this paper we explore the numerical stability of linear filtering technique
proposed recently under the MCC approach. The resulted estimator is called the
maximum correntropy criterion Kalman filter (MCC-KF). The purpose of this study
is two-fold. First, the previously derived MCC-KF equations are revise and the
related Kalman-like equality conditions are proved. Based on this theoretical
finding, we improve the MCC-KF technique in the sense that the new method
possesses a better estimation quality with the reduced computational cost
compared with the previously proposed MCC-KF variant. Second, we devise some
square-root implementations for the newly-designed improved estimator. The
square-root algorithms are well known to be inherently more stable than the
conventional Kalman-like implementations, which process the full error
covariance matrix in each iteration step of the filter. Additionally, following
the latest achievements in the KF community, all square-root algorithms are
formulated here in the so-called array form. All the MCC-KF variants developed
in this paper are demonstrated to outperform the previously proposed MCC-KF
version in two numerical examples.

a temperature gradient as a function of accretion disk radius significantly
flatter than expected for a standard thin accretion disk (T(r) ~ r^{-p}, with

compare this observation to archival XMM-Newton, Chandra, and NuSTAR data from

observations taken around phases 0.3-0.4 show very similar temperature
profiles, even though the observed flux varies significantly, while one
observation taken around phase 0 has a significantly steeper profile. We

persistence in stock markets. Such events, in our context, are monthly spells
of contiguous price decline or negative returns for the S&P500 stock market
index over the last 145 years. Factors known to affect the duration of these
spells are the magnitude or intensity of the price decline, long-term interest
rates and economic recessions, among others. The result of interest is the
conditional probability of ending a spell of consecutive months over which
stock market returns remain negative. In this study, we rely on continuous time
survival models in order to investigate this question. Several specifications
were attempted, some of which under the proportional hazards assumption and
others under the accelerated failure time assumption. The best fit of the
various models endeavored was obtained for the log-normal distribution. This
distribution yields a non-monotonic hazard function that increases up to a
maximum and then decreases. The peak is achieved 2-3 months after the spells
onset with a hazard of around 0.9 or higher; this hazard then decays
asymptotically to zero. Spells duration increase during recessions, when
interest rate rises and when price declines are more intense. The main
conclusion is that short spells of negative returns appear to be mainly
frictional while long spells become structural and trigger hysteresis effects
after an initial period of adjustment. Although in line with our expectations,
these results may be of some importance for policy-makers.

exhibit how market participants accept or not transactions via limit orders as
a function of liquidity imbalance; then we develop a theoretical stochastic
control framework to provide details on how one can exploit his knowledge on
liquidity imbalance to control a limit order. We emphasis the exposure to
adverse selection, of paramount importance for limit orders. For a participant
buying using a limit order: if the price has chances to go down the probability
to be filled is high but it is better to wait a little more before the trade to
obtain a better price. In a third part we show how the added value of
exploiting a knowledge on liquidity imbalance is eroded by latency: being able
to predict future liquidity consuming flows is of less use if you have not
enough time to cancel and reinsert your limit orders. There is thus a rational
for market makers to be as fast as possible as a protection to adverse
selection. Thanks to our optimal framework we can measure the added value of
latency to limit orders placement.
  To authors' knowledge this paper is the first to make the connection between
empirical evidences, a stochastic framework for limit orders including adverse

rhythmic transients in response to stimulation. Even when using the same
stimulation parameters in the same patient, wide variability in the duration of
transient response has been reported. These transients have long been
considered important for the mapping of the excitability levels in the
epileptic brain but their dynamic mechanism is still not well understood.
  To understand the occurrence of abnormal transients dynamically, we use a
thalamo-cortical neural population model of epileptic spike-wave activity and
study the interaction between slow and fast subsystems.
  In a reduced version of the thalamo-cortical model, slow wave oscillations
arise from a fold of cycles (FoC) bifurcation. This marks the onset of a region
of bistability between a high amplitude oscillatory rhythm and the background
state. In vicinity of the bistability in parameter space, the model has
excitable dynamics, showing prolonged rhythmic transients in response to
suprathreshold pulse stimulation. We analyse the state space geometry of the
bistable and excitable states, and find that the rhythmic transient arises when
the impending FoC bifurcation deforms the state space and creates an area of
locally reduced attraction to the fixed point. This area essentially allows
trajectories to dwell there before escaping to the stable steady state, thus
creating rhythmic transients. In the full thalamo-cortical model, we find a
similar FoC bifurcation structure.
  Based on the analysis, we propose an explanation of why stimulation induced
epileptiform activity may vary between trials, and predict how the variability
could be related to ongoing oscillatory background activity.

modules based on thin slumped glass foils are being developed at various
institutes, aiming at improving the angular resolution to a few arcsec HEW.
Thin mirrors are prone to deform, so they require a careful integration to
avoid deformations and even correct forming errors. On the other hand, this
offers the opportunity to actively correct the residual deformation: a viable
possibility to improve the mirror figure is the application of piezoelectric
actuators onto the non-optical side of the mirrors, and several groups are
already at work on this approach. The concept we are developing consists of
actively integrating thin glass foils with piezoelectric patches, fed by
voltages driven by the feedback provided by X-rays. The actuators are
commercial components, while the tension signals are carried by a printed
circuit obtained by photolithography, and the driving electronic is a
multi-channel low power consumption voltage supply developed in-house. Finally,
the shape detection and the consequent voltage signal to be provided to the
piezoelectric array are determined in X-rays, in intra-focal setup at the XACT

couple the new economic dimension Complexity, which captures how sophisticated
products are, with an index called logPRODY, a measure of the income of the
respective exporters. Products' aggregate motion is treated as a 2-dimensional
dynamical system in the Complexity-logPRODY plane. We find that this motion can
be explained by a quantitative model involving the competition on the markets,
that can be mapped as a scalar field on the Complexity-logPRODY plane and acts
in a way akin to a potential. This explains the movement of products towards
areas of the plane in which the competition is higher. We analyse market
composition in more detail, finding that for most products it tends, over time,
to a characteristic configuration, which depends on the Complexity of the
products. This market configuration, which we called asymptotic, is
characterized by higher levels of competition.

the impact of magnification uncertainties on LF results and thus provide more
realistic constraints than other recent work. Our simulations reveal that for
the highly-magnified sources the systematic uncertainties can become extremely
large fainter than -14 mag, reaching several orders of magnitude at 95%

impact of magnification uncertainties into the LF results by exploiting the
availability of many independent magnification models for the same cluster. One
public magnification model is used to construct a mock high-redshift galaxy
sample that is then analyzed using the other magnification models to construct
a LF. Large systematic errors occur at high magnifications (mu>30) because of
differences between the models. The volume densities we derive for faint (>-17
mag) sources are ~3-4x lower than one recent report and give a faint-end slope
alpha=-1.92+/-0.04, which is 3.0-3.5sigma shallower (including or not including
the size uncertainties, respectively). We introduce a new curvature parameter
delta to model the faint end of the LF and demonstrate that the observations
permit (at 68% confidence) a turn-over at z~6 in the range -15.3 to -14.2 mag,

convergence in finding the solution to the Compressed Sensing (CS) problems.
Recently, it was observed that the robustness of a class of iterative sparse
recovery algorithms such as Iterative Method with Adaptive Thresholding (IMAT)
has outperformed the well-known LASSO algorithm in terms of reconstruction
quality, convergence speed, and the sensitivity to the noise. In this paper, we
introduce a new method towards solving the CS problem. The logic of this method
is based on iterative projections of the thresholded signal onto the null-space
of the sensing matrix. The thresholding is carried out by recovering the
support of the desired signal by projection on thresholding subspaces. The
simulations reveal that the proposed method has the capability of yielding
noticeable output SNR values with about as many samples as twice the sparsity
number, while other methods fail to recover the signals when approaching the
algebraic bound for the number of samples required. The computational
complexity of our method is also comparable to other methods as observed in the
simulations. We have also extended our Algorithm to Matrix Completion (MC)
scenarios and compared its efficiency to other well-reputed approaches for MC

charm quark pairs in the lowest order Feynman diagrams, since the diagrams
where a photon radiated from light quarks are suppressed by $\alpha_s$ or the
relative charm quark velocity $v$, due to Charge parity conservation. The form
factors of two gluons to $\eta$ or $\eta^\prime$ are employed, which are the
major mechanism for $\eta$ and $\eta^\prime$ productions. $\eta(\eta^\prime)$
is treated as a light cone object when we consider that the parent charmonium
mass is much heavier than that of the final light meson. We obtain the
branching ratio ${\cal B}(h_c\to \gamma\eta^\prime) =
(1.94^{+0.70}_{-0.51})\times 10^{-3}$ in the nonrelativistic QCD approach,
which is in agreement with the BESIII measurement. The prediction of the
branching ratio of $h_c\to \gamma\eta$ is also within the range of experimental
error after including the larger uncertainty of the total decay width
$\Gamma_{h_c}$. The applications of these formulae to the radiative decays to
$\eta(\eta^\prime)$ of the \emph{P}-wave spin singlet bottomonium $h_b(nP)$ are
presented. These studies will shed some light on the $\eta - \eta^\prime$

CO$_2$ interactions with other volatiles both in interstellar ices and in
laboratory experiments of interstellar ice analogs. We report laboratory
spectra of the CO$_2$ longitudinal optical (LO) phonon mode in pure CO$_2$ ice
and in CO$_2$ ice mixtures with H$_2$O, CO, O$_2$ components. We show that the
LO phonon mode position is sensitive to the mixing ratio of various ice
components of astronomical interest. In the era of JWST, this characteristic
could be used to constrain interstellar ice compositions and morphologies. More
immediately, LO phonon mode spectroscopy provides a sensitive probe of ice
mixing in the laboratory and should thus enable diffusion measurements with
higher precision than has been previously possible.

Specifically, we consider arrays of phase oscillators coupled in a ring or a
chain topology. Each ring is perfectly matched to a chain with the same initial
conditions and the same random natural frequencies. The only difference is
their boundary conditions: periodic for a ring, and open for a chain. For both
topologies, stable phase-locked states exist if and only if the spread or
""width"" of the natural frequencies is smaller than a critical value called the
locking threshold (which depends on the boundary conditions and the particular
realization of the frequencies). The central question is whether a ring
synchronizes more readily than a chain. We show that it usually does, but not
always. Rigorous bounds are derived for the ratio between the locking
thresholds of a ring and its matched chain, for a variant of the Kuramoto model
that also includes a wider family of models.

rays with the interstellar medium and in old supernova remnants, and possibly,
in exotic sources such as primordial black hole evaporation or dark matter
annihilations and decays. The search for signals from exotic sources in
antiproton data is hampered by large backgrounds from spallation which, within
theoretical errors, can solely account for the current data. Due to the higher
energy threshold for antideuteron production, which translates into a
suppression of the low energy flux from spallations, antideuteron searches have
been proposed as a probe for exotic sources. We perform in this paper a
comprehensive analysis of the antideuteron fluxes at the Earth expected from
known and hypothetical sources in our Galaxy, and we calculate their maximal
values consistent with current antiproton data from AMS-02. We find that
supernova remnants generate a negligible flux, whereas primordial black hole
evaporation and dark matter annihilations or decays may dominate the total flux
at low energies. On the other hand, we find that the detection of cosmic
antideuterons would require, for the scenarios studied in this paper and
assuming optimistic values of the coalescence momentum and solar modulation, an
increase of the experimental sensitivity compared to ongoing and planned
instruments by at least a factor of 2. Finally, we briefly comment on the
prospects for antihelium-3 detection.

to utilize the continuum of whole body motion that is truly available to the

tend to struggle with the complexity of large-scale problems. We introduce a
planning method, called the ""Randomized Possibility Graph"", which uses
high-level approximations of constraint manifolds to rapidly explore the
""possibility"" of actions, thereby allowing lower-level motion planners to be
utilized more efficiently. We demonstrate simulations of the method working in
a variety of semi-unstructured environments. In this context,
""semi-unstructured"" means the walkable terrain is flat and even, but there are
arbitrary 3D obstacles throughout the environment which may need to be stepped
over or maneuvered around using whole body motions.

obstacles and adverse environments. Footstep planners are typically only
designed for one mode of locomotion, but traversing unfavorable environments
may require several forms of locomotion to be sequenced together, such as
walking, crawling, and jumping. Multi-modal motion planners can be used to
address some of these problems, but existing implementations tend to be
time-consuming and are limited to quasi-static actions. This paper presents a
motion planning method to traverse complex environments using multiple
categories of continuous actions. To this end, this paper formulates and
exploits the Possibility Graph---which uses high-level approximations of
constraint manifolds to rapidly explore the ""possibility"" of actions---to
utilize lower-level single-action motion planners more effectively. We show
that the Possibility Graph can quickly find routes through several different

micro-grid, a highly automated and distributed cyber-physical energy system
(CPES). We establish rigorous mathematical expressions for electric loads and
battery banks in the micro-grid by considering their characteristics and
constraints. Based on these mathematical models, we propose a novel real-time
scheduling analysis method for priority-based energy management in micro-grid,
named Significant Moments Analysis (SMA). SMA pinpoints all the crucial moments
when electrical operations are requested among the micro-grid and establishes a
dynamic model to describe the scheduling behavior of electric loads. Using SMA,
we can check the scheduling feasibility and predict whether the micro-grid can
generate enough power to support the execution of electric loads. In the case
where the power is insufficient to supply load demands, SMA can provide
accurate information about the amount of insufficient power and the time when
the insufficiency happens. Simulated results are presented to show the
effectiveness of the proposed analysis method.

inequalities and minimization of convex functions, can be reduced to finding
zeros (namely, roots) of set-valued operators. Hence numerous algorithms have
been devised in order to achieve this task. A lot of these algorithms are
inexact in the sense that they allow perturbations to appear during the
iterative process, and hence they enable one to better deal with noise and
computational errors, as well as superiorization. For many years a certain
fundamental question has remained open regarding many of these known inexact
algorithmic schemes in various finite and infinite dimensional settings, namely
whether there exist sequences satisfying these inexact schemes when errors
appear. We provide a positive answer to this question. Our results also show
that various theorems discussing the convergence of these inexact schemes have
a genuine merit beyond the exact case. As a by-product we solve the standard
and the strongly implicit inexact resolvent inclusion problems, introduce a
promising class of functions (fully Legendre functions), establish continuous
dependence (stability) properties of the solution of the inexact resolvent
inclusion problem and continuity properties of the protoresolvent, and
generalize the notion of strong monotonicity.
