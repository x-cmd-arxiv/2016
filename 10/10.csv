the Guitar Nebula stands out for its peculiar morphology, which consists of a

formulate generative models, and then infer their parameters from data. When
the desired structure is composed of modules or ""communities"", a suitable
choice for this task is the stochastic block model (SBM), where nodes are
divided into groups, and the placement of edges is conditioned on the group
memberships. Here, we present a nonparametric Bayesian method to infer the
modular structure of empirical networks, including the number of modules and
their hierarchical organization. We focus on a microcanonical variant of the
SBM, where the structure is imposed via hard constraints, i.e. the generated
networks are not allowed to violate the patterns imposed by the model. We show
how this simple model variation allows simultaneously for two important
improvements over more traditional inference approaches: 1. Deeper Bayesian
hierarchies, with noninformative priors replaced by sequences of priors and
hyperpriors, that not only remove limitations that seriously degrade the
inference on large networks, but also reveal structures at multiple scales; 2.
A very efficient inference algorithm that scales well not only for networks
with a large number of nodes and edges, but also with an unlimited number of
modules. We show also how this approach can be used to sample modular
hierarchies from the posterior distribution, as well as to perform model
selection. We discuss and analyze the differences between sampling from the
posterior and simply finding the single parameter estimate that maximizes it.
Furthermore, we expose a direct equivalence between our microcanonical approach
and alternative derivations based on the canonical SBM.

observations, the number of confirmed cases of galaxies with counterrotation is
increasing rapidly. The evolution of such counterrotating galaxies remains far
from being well understood. In this paper we study the dynamics of
counterrotating collisionless stellar disks by means of $N$-body simulations.
We show that, in the presence of counterrotation, an otherwise gravitationally
stable disk can naturally generate bending waves accompanied by strong disk
heating across the disk plane, that is in the vertical direction. Such
conclusion is found to hold even for dynamically warm systems with typical
values of the initial vertical-to-radial velocity dispersion ratio $\sigma_{\rm
z}/\sigma_{\rm R} \approx 0.5$, for which the role of pressure anisotropy
should be unimportant. We note that, during evolution, the $\sigma_{\rm
z}/\sigma_{\rm R}$ ratio tends to rise up to values close to unity in the case
of locally Jeans-stable disks, whereas in disks that are initially
Jeans-unstable it may reach even higher values, especially in the innermost
regions. This unusual behavior of the $\sigma_{\rm z}/\sigma_{\rm R}$ ratio in
galaxies with counterrotation appears not to have been noticed earlier. Our
investigations of systems made of two counterrotating components with different
mass-ratios suggest that even apparently normal disk galaxies (i.e., with a
minor counterrotating component so as to escape detection in current
observations) might be subject to significant disk heating especially in the
vertical direction.

artificial divisions form and evolve. In this work we investigate the
population distribution of second level administrative units for 150 countries

better than power law in almost every case. Particularly, DGBD is better than

that, barring possible logarithmic corrections, $L_{n} \sim n^{\theta}$ with
the leading scaling exponent $0.60 \lesssim \theta \lesssim 0.69$ for the
heavy-tailed distributions of step lengths examined, with values increasing as
the distribution becomes more heavy-tailed, and $\theta \simeq 0.57$ for
distributions of finite variance, irrespective of the particular distribution.
The results are consistent with existing rigorous bounds for $\theta$, although
in a somewhat surprising manner. For random walks with step lengths of finite
variance, we conjecture that the correct asymptotic behavior of $L_{n}$ is
given by $\sqrt{n}\ln n$, and also propose the form of the subleading
asymptotics. The distribution of $L_{n}$ was found to follow a simple scaling
form with scaling functions that vary with $\theta$. Accordingly, when the step
lengths are of finite variance they seem to be universal. The nature of this
scaling remains unclear, since we lack a working model, microscopic or

$z\sim 2.6$ by stacking normalized, rest-frame shifted spectra of $\sim
27\,000$ DLAs from the DR12 of BOSS/SDSS-III. We measure the equivalent widths
of 50 individual metal absorption lines in 5 intervals of DLA hydrogen column
density, 5 intervals of DLA redshift, and overall mean equivalent widths for an
additional 13 absorption features from groups of strongly blended lines. The
mean equivalent width of low-ionization lines increases with $N_{\rm HI}$,
whereas for high-ionization lines the increase is much weaker. The mean metal
line equivalent widths decrease by a factor $\sim 1.1-1.5$ from $z\sim2.1$ to
$z \sim 3.5$, with small or no differences between low- and high-ionization
species. We develop a theoretical model, inspired by the presence of multiple
absorption components observed in high-resolution spectra, to infer mean metal
column densities from the equivalent widths of partially saturated metal lines.
We apply this model to 14 low-ionization species and to AlIII, SIII, SiIII,
CIV, SiIV, NV and OVI. We use an approximate derivation for separating the
equivalent width contributions of several lines to blended absorption features,
and infer mean equivalent widths and column densities from lines of the
additional species NI, ZnII, CII${}^{*}$, FeIII, and SIV. Several of these mean
column densities of metal lines in DLAs are obtained for the first time; their
values generally agree with measurements of individual DLAs from
high-resolution, high signal-to-noise ratio spectra when they are available.

deep learning in order to determine the visual cues that results in best height

comprising of two Convolutional Neural Networks, one based on spatial

Given an egocentric video as an input to the framework, our model yields a
height estimate as an output. We also incorporate late fusion to learn a
combination of temporal and spatial cues. Comparing our model with other
methods we used as baselines, we achieve height estimates for videos with a
Mean Average Error of 14.04 cm over a range of 103 cm of data, and
classification accuracy for relative height (tall, medium or short) up to

shined a spot light on slowly rotating fully convective M-stars. When such
stars rotate rapidly (period $\lesssim 20$ days), they are known to generate
very high levels of activity that is powered by a magnetic field much stronger
than the solar magnetic field. Recent theoretical efforts are beginning to
understand the dynamo process that generates such strong magnetic fields.
However, the observational and theoretical landscape remains relatively
uncharted for fully convective M-stars that rotate slowly. Here we present an
anelastic dynamo simulation designed to mimic some of the physical
characteristics of Proxima Centauri, a representative case for slowly rotating
fully convective M-stars. The rotating convection spontaneously generates
differential rotation in the convection zone which drives coherent magnetic
cycles where the axisymmetric magnetic field repeatedly changes polarity at all
latitudes as time progress. The typical length of the `activity' cycle in the
simulation is about nine years, in good agreement with the recently proposed
activity cycle length of about seven years for Proxima Centauri. Comparing our
results with earlier work, we hypothesis that the dynamo mechanism undergoes a
fundamental change in nature as fully convective stars spin down with age.

ArXiv:1510.01395 [MathDG] 5 Oct 2015. Let $\pi : E \to M$ be a locally trivial
fiber bundle over a two-dimensional manifold $M$, and $\Sigma \subset M$ be a
discrete subset. A subset $Q \subset E$ is called an $n$-sheeted branched
section of the bundle $\pi$ if $Q' = \pi^{-1}(M \setminus \Sigma) \cap Q$ is a
$n$-sheeted covering of $M \setminus \Sigma$. The set $\Sigma$ is called the
singularity set of the branched section $Q$. We define the index of a
singularity point of a branched section, and give examples of its calculation,
in particular for branched sections of the projective tangent bundle of $M$
determined by binary differential equations. Also we define a resolution of
singularities of a branched section, and prove an analog of
Hopf-Poincar\'e-Gauss-Bonnet theorem for the branched sections admitting a
resolution.

significant examples. The moduli spaces of framed sheaves on $\mathbb{P}^2$, on
multiple blowup of $\mathbb{P}^2$ are described in terms of ADHM data and, when
this characterization is available, as quiver varieties. The second part is
devoted to a detailed study of framed sheaves on the Hirzebruch surface
$\Sigma_n$ in the case when the invariant expressing the necessary and
sufficient condition for the nonemptiness of moduli spaces attains its minimum
(what we call the ""minimal case""). Our main result is that, under this
assumption, the corresponding moduli space is isomorphic to a Grassmannian
(when $n=1$), or to the direct sum of $n-1$ copies of the cotangent bundle of a
Grassmannian (when $n\geq 2$). Finally, by slightly generalizing a construction
due to Nakajima, we prove that these moduli spaces admit a description as
quiver varieties.

velocity at the position of a particle is determined by interpolation, such
that a Stokes friction force gives rise to an exchange of momentum between the
particle and the surrounding fluid nodes. For efficiency reasons, the LB time
step is chosen as a multiple of the MD time step, such that the MD system is
updated more frequently than the LB fluid. In this situation, there are
different ways to implement the coupling: Either the fluid velocity at the
surrounding nodes is only updated every LB time step, or it is updated every MD

conservation on a significantly shorter time scale, is clearly superior in
terms of stability and accuracy, and nevertheless only marginally slower in

Mars. Erosion is swift enough that radiolysis cannot destroy complex organic
matter at some locations (e.g. paleolake deposits at SW Melas), but radiolysis
is a severe problem at other locations (e.g. Oxia Planum). The data suggest
that the relief of the Valles Marineris mounds is currently being reduced by
wind erosion, and that dust production on Mars <3 Gya greatly exceeds the
modern reservoir of mobile dust.

extensively studied, but much less investigated under non-isothermal

the isothermal assumption of the whole system meets great challenge, which is
indeed the case inside many kinds of living organisms. Here we generalize the
nonequilibrium steady-state theory of isothermal biochemical cycle kinetics, in
the master-equation models, to the situation in which the temperatures of
subsystems can be far from uniform. We first obtain a new thermodynamic
relation between the chemical reaction rates and thermodynamic potentials under
such a non-isothermal circumstances, which immediately implies simply applying
the isothermal transition-state rate formula for each chemical reaction in
terms of only the reactants' temperature, is not thermodynamically consistent.
Therefore, we mathematically derive several revised reaction-rate formulas
which not only obey the new thermodynamic relation but also approximate the
exact reaction rate better than the rate formula under isothermal condition.
The new thermodynamic relation also predicts that in the transporter system
with different temperatures inside and outside the membrane, the net flux of
the transported molecules can possibly even go against the temperature gradient
in the absence of the chemical driving force.

The values of B$_{pos}$ in L1415 and L1389 are found to be 28$~\mu$G and
149$~\mu$G using CF technique and 23$~\mu$G and 140$~\mu$G using structure
function analysis, respectively. The values of B$_{pos}$ in these clouds are
found to be consistent using both the techniques. By combining the present
results with those obtained from our previous study of magnetic fields in cores
with VeLLOs, we attempt to improve the sample of cores with low luminosity
protostars and bridge the gap between the understanding of importance of
magnetic fields in cores with VeLLOs and low luminosity protostars. The Results
of this work and that of our previous work show that the outflow directions are
aligned with envelope magnetic fields of the clouds.

uses ionised gas kinematics, probed by H{\alpha} emission. By this method
23+/-7% of our 360-galaxy sub-sample of the SAMI Galaxy Survey are
kinematically asymmetric. Visual classifications agree with our kinemetric
results for 90% of asymmetric and 95% of normal galaxies. We find stellar mass
and kinematic asymmetry are inversely correlated and that kinematic asymmetry
is both more frequent and stronger in low-mass galaxies. This builds on
previous studies that found high fractions of kinematic asymmetry in low mass
galaxies using a variety of different methods. Concentration of star forma-
tion and kinematic disturbance are found to be correlated, confirming results
found in previous work. This effect is stronger for high mass galaxies (log(M*)
> 10) and indicates that kinematic disturbance is linked to centrally
concentrated star formation. Comparison of the inner (within 0.5Re) and outer
H{\alpha} equivalent widths of asymmetric and normal galaxies shows a small but

controller has a choice of which server to use at each time slot and server
performance varies according to a Markov modulated random environment. We
explore the role of information in the system stability region. At the extreme
cases of information availability, that is when there is either full
information or no information, stability regions and maximally stabilizing
policies are trivial. But in the more realistic cases where only the
environment state of the selected server is observed, only the service
successes are observed or only queue length is observed, finding throughput
maximizing control laws is a challenge. To handle these situations, we devise a
Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP) formulation of the problem
and illustrate properties of its solution. We further model the system under
given decision rules, using Quasi-Birth-and-Death (QBD) structure to find a
matrix analytic expression for the stability bound. We use this formulation to
illustrate how the stability region grows as the number of controller belief
states increases.
  Our focus in this paper is on the simple case of two servers where the
environment of each is modulated according to a two-state Markov chain. As
simple as this case seems, there appear to be no closed form descriptions of
the stability region under the various regimes considered. Our numerical
approximations to the POMDP Bellman equations and the numerical solutions of
the QBDs hint at a variety of structural results.

validated against microscopy and provided promising results in studies of brain

mostly used in dedicated animal studies and clinical studies of slowly
progressing diseases but has not yet emerged as a routine clinical tool. To
this end, a less data intensive experimental method would be beneficial by
enabling high resolution validation studies, and ease clinical applications by
speeding up data acquisition compared to typical diffusion kurtosis imaging
(DKI) protocols utilized as part of WMTI imaging. Here, we evaluate WMTI based
on recently introduced axially symmetric DKI which has lower data demand than
conventional DKI. We compare WMTI parameters derived from conventional DKI to
those calculated analytically from axially symmetric DKI. We employ numerical
simulations, as well as data from fixed rat spinal cord (1) and in vivo human
(3) and rat brain (4). Our analysis shows that analytical WMTI based on axially
symmetric DKI with sparse data sets (19 images) produces WMTI metrics that
correlate strongly with estimates based on traditional DKI data sets (60 images
or more). We demonstrate the preclinical potential of the proposed WMTI
technique in in vivo rat brain (300 {\mu}m isotropic resolution with whole
brain coverage). WMTI parameter estimates are subject to a duality leading to
two solution branches dependent on a sign choice which is currently debated.
Results from both of these branches are presented and discussed throughout our
analysis. The proposed fast WMTI approach may be useful for preclinical
research and e.g. clinical evaluation of patients with traumatic white matter
injuries or symptoms of neurovascular or neuroinflammatory disorders.

are sparse in time (typically few measurements per night) and can be
potentially used for the determination of shapes and rotational states of
asteroids. The method which is generally used to derive these parameters is the
lightcurve inversion. However, for most asteroids their sparse data are not
accurate enough to derive a unique model and the lightcurve inversion method is
thus not very efficient.
  Aims: To fully utilize photometry sparse in time, we developed a new
simplified model and applied it on the data from the Lowell photometric
database. Our aim was to derive spin axis orientations and shape elongations of
asteroids and to reconstruct distributions of these parameters for selected
subpopulations to find if there are some differences.
  Methods: We model asteroids as geometrically scattering triaxial ellipsoids.
Observed values of mean brightness and the dispersion of brightness are
compared with computed values obtained from the parameters of the model --
ecliptical longitude $\lambda$ and latitude $\beta$ of the pole and the ratios
$a/b$, $b/c$ of axes of the ellipsoid. These parameters are optimized to get
the best agreement with the observation.
  Results: We found that the distribution of $\lambda$ for main-belt asteroids
is not uniform (in agreement with findings of Bowell et al., 2014, M&PS, 49,
95) and is dependent on the inclination of orbit. Surprisingly, the
non-uniformity of $\lambda$ distribution is larger for asteroids residing on
low-inclination orbits. We also studied distributions of $a/b$ for several
groups of asteroids and found that small asteroids ($D<25\,$km) are on average
more elongated than large ones.

be 1.00:1.01 +- 0.02:1.35 +- 0.03:86.4 +- 1.6 for
[H13CCCN]:[HC13CCN]:[HCC13CN]:[HCCCN], where the errors represent one standard
deviation. The ratios are very similar to those reported for the starless
cloud, Taurus Molecular Cloud-1 Cyanopolyyne Peak (TMC-1 CP). These ratios
cannot be explained by thermal equilibrium, but likely reflect the production
pathways of this molecule. We have shown the equality of the abundances of
H13CCCN and HC13CCN at a high-confidence level, which supports the production
pathways of HC3N via C2H2 and C2H2+. The average 12C/13C ratio for HC3N is 77
+- 4, which may be only slightly higher than the elemental 12C/13C ratio.
Dilution of the 13C isotope in HC3N is not as significant as that in CCH or
c-C3H2. We have also simultaneously observed the DCCCN and HCCC15N lines and
derived the isotope ratios: [DCCCN]/[HCCCN] = 0.0370 +- 0.0007 and
[HCCCN]/[HCCC15N] = 338 +- 12.

delay are accounted for in the E2E delay, and different packet loss/error
probabilities are considered to characterize the reliability. We show that the
required transmit power becomes unbounded when the allowed maximal queueing
delay is shorter than the channel coherence time. To satisfy quality-of-service

dropping mechanism, and optimize a queue state information and channel state
information dependent transmission policy. Since the resource and policy for
transmission and the packet dropping policy are related to the packet error
probability, queueing delay violation probability, and packet dropping

We present STASH, a system for relay-resilient transparent authentication in
which the prover does proximity verification by comparing its approach
trajectory towards the intended verifier with known authorized reference
trajectories. Trajectories are measured using low-cost sensors commonly
available on personal devices. We demonstrate the security of STASH against a

Quality-of-Service (QoS) requirement is expected to be satisfied not at the

In this paper, we study how to maximize the EE for tactile internet under the
stringent QoS constraint, where both queueing delay and transmission delay are
taken into account. We first validate that the upper bound of queueing delay
violation probability derived from the effective bandwidth can be used to
characterize the queueing delay violation probability in the short delay regime
for Poisson arrival process. However, the upper bound is not tight for short
delay, which leads to conservative designs and hence leads to wasting energy.
To avoid this, we optimize resource allocation that depends on the queue state
information and channel state information. Analytical results show that with a
large number of transmit antennas the EE achieved by the proposed policy
approaches to the EE limit achieved for infinite delay bound, which implies
that the policy does not lead to any EE loss. Simulation and numerical results
show that even for not-so-large number of antennas, the EE achieved by the
proposed policy is still close to the EE limit.

  Style Modelling",,,,,"cs.OH","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  This paper presents a novel approach to distinguish driving styles with
respect to their energy efficiency. A distinct property of our method is that
it relies exclusively on Global Positioning System (GPS) logs of drivers. This
setting is highly relevant in practice as these data can easily be acquired.
  Relying on positional data alone means that all derived features will be
correlated, so we strive to find a single quantity that allows us to perform
the driving style analysis. To this end we consider a robust variation of the
so called jerk of a movement. We show that our feature choice outperforms other
more commonly used jerk-based formulations and we discuss the handling of
noisy, inconsistent, and incomplete data as this is a notorious problem when
dealing with real-world GPS logs.
  Our solving strategy relies on an agglomerative hierarchical clustering
combined with an L-term heuristic to determine the relevant number of clusters.
It can easily be implemented and performs fast, even on very large, real-world
data sets. Experiments show that our approach is robust against noise and able
to discern different driving styles.

type devices in tactile internet, where ultra-short delay and ultra-high
reliability are required. To characterize the transmission reliability
constraint, we employ a two-state transmission model based on the achievable
rate with finite blocklength channel codes. If the channel gain exceeds a
threshold, a short packet can be transmitted with a small error probability;
otherwise there is a packet loss. To exploit frequency diversity, we assign
multiple subchannels to each active device, from which the device selects a
subchannel with channel gain exceeding the threshold for transmission. To show
the total bandwidth required to ensure the reliability, we optimize the number
of subchannels and bandwidth of each subchannel and the threshold for each
device to minimize the total bandwidth of the system with a given number of
antennas at the base station. Numerical results show that with 1000 devices in
one cell, the required bandwidth of the optimized policy is acceptable even for
prevalent cellular systems. Furthermore, we show that by increasing antennas at
the BS, frequency diversity becomes unnecessary, and the required bandwidth is
reduced.

by elastic tunneling through a single quantum-dot. We find that nonlinear
thermoelectric transport can lead to enhanced efficiency and power for both
types of devices. A comprehensive survey of various quantum-dot energy,
temperature, and parasitic heat conduction reveals that the nonlinear transport
induced improvements of the maximum efficiency and power are overall much more
significant for inelastic devices than the elastic devices, even for
temperature biases as small as $T_h=1.2T_c$ ($T_h$ and $T_c$ are the
temperatures of the hot and cold reservoirs, respectively). The underlying
mechanism is revealed as due to the fact that, unlike the Fermi distribution,
the Bose distribution is not bounded when the temperature bias increases. A
large flux density of absorbed phonons leads to great enhancement of the
electrical current, the output power, and the energy efficiency, dominating
over the concurrent increase of the parasitic heat current. Our study reveals
that nonlinear transport effects can be a useful tool for improving
thermoelectric performance.

optimization. We focus on the case of linear programs (LPs), given by $d$
variables with $n$ inequality constraints. A constraint is called
\emph{redundant}, if after its removal, the LP still has the same feasible
region. The currently fastest method to detect all redundancies is due to
Clarkson: it solves $n$ linear programs, but each of them has at most $s$
constraints, where $s$ is the number of nonredundant constraints.
  In this paper, we study the special case where every constraint has at most
two variables with nonzero coefficients. This family, denoted by $LI(2)$, has
some nice properties. Namely, as shown by Aspvall and Shiloach, given a
variable $x_i$ and a value $\lambda$, we can test in time $O(nd)$ whether there
is a feasible solution with $x_i = \lambda$. Hochbaum and Naor present an
$O(d^2 n \log n)$ algorithm for solving the feasibility problem in $LI(2)$.
Their technique makes use of the Fourier-Motzkin elimination method and the
earlier mentioned result by Aspvall and Shiloach.
  We present a strongly polynomial algorithm that solves redundancy detection
in time $O(n d^2 s \log s)$. It uses a modification of Clarkson's algorithm,
together with a revised version of Hochbaum and Naor's technique. Finally we
show that dimensionality testing can be done with the same running time as

generalize secondary users' heterogeneous demands for multiple resources and

static and dynamic partition schemes combined with new payment mechanisms to
obtain high revenue and fairly allocate the resources. The proposed auction
schemes stimulate the participation of SUs and provide high revenue for the PO
while maximizing the social welfare. Besides, they satisfy the properties of
truthfulness, individual rationality and computational tractability. Simulation
results have shown that for highly demanding users the static group scheme
achieves 150% more winners and 3 times higher revenue for the PO compared to a
scheme without grouping. For lowly demanding users, the PO may keep similar
revenue with the dynamic scheme by lowering 50% the price per channel as the
number of winners will increase proportionally.

to reformulate the axiom of choice, Baire's category theorem, and many large
cardinal axioms as specific instances of forcing axioms. We then address
forcing axioms with a model-theoretic perspective and outline a deep analogy

this is possible for certain initial fragments of the universe of sets: The
pioneering work of Woodin on generic absoluteness show that this is the case

and recent works by the author show that this can also be the case for the
Chang model $L(\text{Ord}^{\omega_1})$ in the presence of large cardinals and
maximal strengthenings of Martin's maximum or of the proper forcing axiom. The
major open question we leave open is whether this situation is peculiar to
these Chang models or can be lifted up also to $L(\text{Ord}^\kappa)$ for

asymptotically or is bounded by a geometric sequence, then the solution
(appropriately scaled) omits a convenient asymptotic representation. Moreover,
this representation is used to show that additional growth properties of the
perturbation are preserved in the solution. If the forcing term fluctuates
asymptotically, we prove that fluctuations of the same magnitude will be
present in the solution and we also connect the finiteness of time averages of
the solution with those of the perturbation. Our results, and corollaries
thereof, apply to stochastic as well as deterministic equations, and we
demonstrate this by studying some representative classes of examples. Finally,
we show that our theory can be extended to cover a class of nonlinear equations
via a straightforward linearisation argument.

LR-algorithms that achieve, for an ordered rooted binary tree with $n$ nodes,
width $O(n^{0.695})$, width $O(n^{0.5})$, and width $O(n^{0.48})$.
  We prove that, for every $n$-node ordered rooted binary tree, an LR-drawing
with minimum width can be constructed in $O(n^{1.48})$ time. Further, we show
an infinite family of $n$-node ordered rooted binary trees requiring
$\Omega(n^{0.418})$ width in any LR-drawing; no lower bound better than
$\Omega(\log n)$ was previously known. Finally, we present the results of an
experimental evaluation that allowed us to determine the minimum width of all
the ordered rooted binary trees with up to $451$ nodes.

have outerplanar straight-line drawings in $O(n^{1.48})$ area by means of a
drawing algorithm which resembles an LR-algorithm.

LR-drawings with $f(n)$ width, for any function $f(n)$, then $n$-vertex
outerplanar graphs have outerplanar straight-line drawings in $O(f(n))$ area.

repulsive particles assume pairwise potentials with a sharp cut-off in the
interaction range. The sharp cut-off renders the potential non-analytic, but
makes it possible to describe many properties of the solid in terms of the
coordination number $z$, which has an unambiguous definition in these cases.
Pairwise potentials without a sharp cut-off in the interaction range have not
been considered in this context, but are of interest for understanding the
relevance of the unjamming phenomenology to systems in which such a cut-off
cannot be assumed. In this work we explore two systems with such interactions:
an inverse power law and an exponentially decaying pairwise potential, with the
control parameters being the exponent (of the inverse power-law) for the former
and the number density for the latter. Both systems are shown to exhibit the
characteristic features of the unjamming transition, among which are the
vanishing of the shear to bulk modulus ratio and the emergence of an excess of
low-frequency vibrational modes. We establish a relation between the
hydrostatic pressure to bulk modulus ratio and the distance to unjamming in
each of our model systems. This allows us to predict the dependence of other
key observables on the distance to unjamming. Our results provide the means for
a quantitative estimation of the proximity of generic glass forming models to
the unjamming transition in the absence of a clear-cut definition of the
coordination number, and highlight the general irrelevance of nonaffine
contributions to the bulk modulus.

we investigate whether current retrieval methods will still be valid in the era
of JWST, exploring common approximations used when retrieving transmission
spectra of hot Jupiters. To assess biases, we use 1D photochemical models to
simulate typical hot Jupiter cloud-free atmospheres and generate synthetic
observations for a range of carbon-to-oxygen ratios. Then, we retrieve these
spectra using TauREx, a Bayesian retrieval tool, using two methodologies: one
assuming an isothermal atmosphere, and one assuming a parametrized temperature
profile. Both methods assume constant-with-altitude abundances. We found that
the isothermal approximation biases the retrieved parameters considerably,
overestimating the abundances by about one order of magnitude. The retrieved
abundances using the parametrized profile are usually within one sigma of the
true state, and we found the retrieved uncertainties to be generally larger
compared to the isothermal approximation. Interestingly, we found that using
the parametrized temperature profile we could place tight constraints on the
temperature structure. This opens the possibility to characterize the
temperature profile of the terminator region of hot Jupiters. Lastly, we found
that assuming a constant-with-altitude mixing ratio profile is a good
approximation for most of the atmospheres under study.

and {\theta} the angle of modulation. It is also found that as the electron
thermal velocity or {\theta} increases, the growth rate of MI increases with
cutoffs at higher wave numbers of modulation. Furthermore, in the nonlinear
evolution of the DS-like equations, it is seen that with an effect of the
relativistic flow, a Gaussian wave beam collapses in a finite time, and the
collapse can be arrested when the effect of the thermal pressure or the
relativistic flow is slightly relaxed. The present results may be useful to the
MI and the formation of localized LW envelopes in cosmic plasmas with a
relativistic flow of electrons.

are meant to support but not enough to recover their underlying datasets. In
this paper we give the first encoding data structure for the challenging
problem of order-preserving pattern matching. This problem was introduced only
a few years ago but has already attracted significant attention because of its
applications in data analysis. Two strings are said to be an order-preserving
match if the {\em relative order} of their characters is the same: e.g., $4, 1,
3, 2$ and $10, 3, 7, 5$ are an order-preserving match. We show how, given a
string $S [1..n]$ over an arbitrary alphabet and a constant $c \geq 1$, we can
build an $O (n \log \log n)$-bit encoding such that later, given a pattern $P
[1..m]$ with $m \leq \lg^c n$, we can return the number of order-preserving
occurrences of $P$ in $S$ in $O (m)$ time. Within the same time bound we can
also return the starting position of some order-preserving match for $P$ in $S$
(if such a match exists). We prove that our space bound is within a constant
factor of optimal; our query time is optimal if $\log \sigma = \Omega(\log n)$.
Our space bound contrasts with the $\Omega (n \log n)$ bits needed in the worst
case to store $S$ itself, an index for order-preserving pattern matching with
no restrictions on the pattern length, or an index for standard pattern
matching even with restrictions on the pattern length. Moreover, we can build
our encoding knowing only how each character compares to $O (\lg^c n)$
neighbouring characters.

fits to the X-ray spectra of all six objects. The optical to X-ray spectral

0.05, which is similar to that found for X-ray selected and optically selected
non-BAL QSOs of similar ultraviolet luminosity. In contrast, optically-selected
BALQSOs typically have much larger alpha_OX and so are characterised as being
X-ray weak. The results imply that X-ray selection yields intrinsically X-ray
bright BALQSOs, but their X-ray spectra are absorbed by a similar degree to
that seen in optically-selected BALQSO samples; X-ray absorption appears to be
ubiquitous in BALQSOs, but X-ray weakness is not. We argue that BALQSOs sit at

Furthermore, we allow the investment opportunity to be subject to the risk of a

dynamical processes on networks, which can model a number of search and
transport processes. However, traditional measurements based on mean first
passage time are not useful as they fail to characterize the cost associated
with each jump. Here we introduce a new concept of mean first traverse distance
(MFTD) to characterize anomalous random walks that represents the expected
traverse distance taken by walkers searching from source node to target node,
and we provide a procedure for calculating the MFTD between two nodes. We use
Levy walks on networks as an example, and demonstrate that the proposed
approach can unravel the interplay between diffusion dynamics of Levy walks and
the underlying network structure. Interestingly, applying our framework to the
famous PageRank search, we can explain why its damping factor empirically
chosen to be around 0.85. The framework for analyzing anomalous random walks on
complex networks offers a new useful paradigm to understand the dynamics of
anomalous diffusion processes, and provides a unified scheme to characterize
search and transport processes on networks.

proofs of these properties are presented, most of which cannot be found in

accelerating/decelerating curves of the NI method. Then, for the fact that when
kinematic constraints are considered, the original version of NI which only
considers torque constraints may result in failure of trajectory planning, we
give the concrete failure conditions with rigorous mathematical proof.
Accordingly, a failure detection algorithm is given in a run-and-test manner.
Some simulation results on a unicycle vehicle are provided to verify those

discovered first, their mathematical proofs are given first in this letter. The
detailed proofs make the theory of NI more complete and help interested readers

charged under both Abelian and non-Abelian group using the Porrati-Rahman

Phenomenologically a theory valid up to a cutoff scale is sensible as all known
higher spin particles are non-fundamental and it is shown that indeed this
action can be used to estimate some relevant cross section. Such action
necessarily includes Stuckelberg field and therefore it is necessary to fix the
corresponding gauge symmetry. We show that this theory, when the Stuckelberg
symmetry is gauge-fixed, possesses a non-trivial infrared problem. A gauge
fixing ambiguity arises which is akin to the Gribov problem in QCD in the
Abelian case as well. In some cases (such as when the space-time is the
four-dimensional torus) the vacuum copies can be found analytically. A similar
phenomenon also appears in the case of Proca fields. A very interesting feature
of these copies is that they arise only for ""large enough"" gauge potentials.
This opens the possibility to avoid the appearance of such gauge fixing
ambiguities by using a Gribov-Zwanziger like approach.

measurements of Faraday rotation of polarised extragalactic radio sources in

catalogue of 1383 rotation measures (RM) of extragalactic polarised radio
sources with X-ray luminous galaxy clusters from the CLASSIX survey (combining
REFLEX II and NORAS II). We compared the RM in the line of sight of clusters
within their projected radii of r_500 with those outside and found a
significant excess of the dispersion of the RM in the cluster regions. Since
the observed RM is the result of Faraday rotation in several presumably
uncorrelated magnetised cells of the intracluster medium, the observations
correspond to quantities averaged over several magnetic field directions and
strengths. Therefore the interesting quantity is the standard deviation of the
RM for an ensemble of clusters. We found a standard deviation of the RM inside
r_500 of about 120 +- 21 rad m^-2. This compares to about 56 +- 8 rad m^-2
outside. We show that the most X-ray luminous and thus most massive clusters
contribute most to the observed excess RM. Modelling the electron density
distribution in the intracluster medium with a self-similar model, we found
that the dispersion of the RM increases with the column density, and we deduce
a magnetic field value of about 2 - 6 (l/10kpc)^-1/2 microG assuming a constant
magnetic field strength, where l is the size of the coherently magnetised
intracluster medium cells. This magnetic field energy density amounts to a few
percent of the average thermal energy density in clusters. When we assumed the
magnetic energy density to be a constant fraction of the thermal energy
density, we deduced a slightly lower value for this fraction of 3 - 10

scales to suppress intermittent fluctuations. We quantify the coexistence of
wild and mild fluctuations in compressed Al alloys micro-pillars, demonstrate
that the statistical nature of fluctuations is determined by sample size, and
propose quantitative strategies allowing one to temper plastic intermittency by
artificially tailored disorder. Our experimental results are rationalized using
a theoretical framework which quantifies the competition between external (size
related) and internal (disorder related) length scales.

structure group $G$, let us consider a stationary Yang-Mills connection $A$
with energy $\int_M |F_A|^2\le \Lambda$. If we consider a sequence of such
connections $A_i$, then it is understood that up to subsequence we can converge
$A_i\to A$ to a singular limit connection such that the energy measures
converge $|F_{A_i}|^2 dv_g\to |F_A|^2dv_g +\nu$, where $\nu=e(x)d\lambda^{n-4}$
is the $n-4$ rectifiable defect measure. Our main result is to show, without
additional assumptions, that for $n-4$ a.e. point the energy density $e(x)$ may
be computed explicitly as the sum of the bubble energies arising from blow ups
at $x$. Each of these bubbles may be realized as a Yang Mills connection over
$S^4$ itself.
  Our second main theorem is to show this hessian bound holds automatically.
Precisely, given a connection $A$ as above we have the apriori estimate $\int_M
|\nabla^2 F_A| < C(\Lambda,\dim G,M)$ for the curvature. It is important to
note this result is proved in tandem with the energy quantization, and not
before it. Indeed, we will in fact prove an effective version of the energy
identity, and it is this effective version which will lead to both the $L^1$
hessian bound and the classical energy quantization results. In the course of
the proof we will provide a quantitative version of the bubble tree
decomposition which hold in all dimensions with effective estimates for a fixed
stationary connections. To produce to strongest estimates in the paper we
introduce an $\epsilon$-gauge condition, which generalizes the usual Coulomb
gauge and which will exist, with effective control, even over singular regions.
On these $\epsilon$-gauges we will provide a new superconvexity estimate which
will be a key tool in analyzing higher dimensional annular regions.

stratification is considered in dependence of the Reynolds number Re of
rotation and the Brunt-V\""ais\""al\""a number Rn of the stratification. The flows
at and beyond the Rayleigh limit become unstable between a lower and an upper
Reynolds number (for fixed Rn). The rotation can thus be too slow or too fast
for the stratorotational instability. The upper Reynolds number above which the
instability decays, has its maximum value for the potential flow (driven by
cylinders rotating according to the Rayleigh limit) and decreases strongly for
flatter rotation profiles finally leaving only isolated islands of instability
in the (Rn/Re) map. The maximal possible rotation ratio $\mu_{\rm max}$ only
slightly exceeds the shear value of the quasi-uniform flow with
$U_\phi\simeq$const.
  Along and between the lines of neutral stability the wave numbers of the
instability patterns for all rotation laws beyond the Rayleigh limit are mainly
determined by the Froude number Fr which is defined by the ratio between Re and
Rn. The cells are highly prolate for Fr>1 so that measurements for too high
Reynolds numbers become difficult for axially bounded containers. The
instability patterns migrate azimuthally slightly faster than the outer
cylinder rotates.

The minimization problem is equivalent to a structural optimization. The
""superblockers"", i.e., the nodes that should be removed from the network to
minimize the size of outbreaks, are those nodes that make connected components
as small as possible. ""Superspreaders"" are instead the nodes such that, if
chosen as initiators, they maximize the average size of outbreaks. The identity
of superspreaders is expected to depend not just on the topology, but also on
the specific dynamics considered. Recently, it has been conjectured that the
two optimization problems might be equivalent, in the sense that superblockers
act also as superspreaders. In spite of its potential groundbreaking
importance, no empirical study has been performed to validate this conjecture.
In this paper, we perform an extensive analysis over a large set of real-world

the spectral and energy efficiency based on the chosen RF-frontend

previous publication, we take the spatial correlation of the quantization noise
into account. We show that the low resolution ADC are robust to small Automatic

vibrational states at low frequencies compared to the phonon spectrum of the
corresponding crystal. Until recently, the consensus was that it originated
from ""defects"" in the glass. The nature of these defects is still under
discussion, but the picture of regions with locally disturbed short-range order
and/or decreased elastic constants has gained some traction. Recently, a
different theory was proposed: The boson peak was attributed to the first van
Hove singularity of crystal lattices which is only smeared out by the disorder.
This new viewpoint assumes that the van Hove singularity is simply shifted by
the decreased density of the amorphous state and is therefore not a
glass-specific anomaly. In order to resolve this issue, we use computer models
of a four-component alloy, alternatively with chemical disorder (high-entropy
alloy), structural disorder, and reduced density. Comparison to a reference
glass of the same composition reveals that the boson peak consists of
additional vibrational modes which can be induced solely by structural
disorder. While chemical disorder introduces fluctuations of the elastic
constants, we find that those do not lead to sufficient local softening to
induce these modes. A boson peak due to a reduction of density could be
excluded for the present metallic system.

subject of research, with significant potential impact on understanding of the

role of vorticity in plasma heating. In magnetohydrodynamics small scale
vorticity is generated near current sheets and this effect persists in kinetic
plasma, as demonstrated here with hybrid and fully kinetic Particle-In-Cell
(PIC) simulations. Furthermore, vorticity enhances local kinetic effects, with
a generalized resonance condition selecting sign-dependent enhancements or
reductions of proton heating and thermal anisotropy. In such plasmas heating is
correlated with vorticity and current density, but more strongly with
vorticity. These results help explain several prior results that find kinetic
effects and energization near to, but not centered on, current sheets.
Evidently intermittency in kinetic plasma involves multiple physical
quantities, and the associated coherent structures and nonthermal effects are
closely related.

ensure effective performance because it increases the diversity of high-level

feature map dimension at units that perform downsampling, we gradually increase
the feature map dimension at all units to involve as many locations as

where DL and UL are not constrained to be associated to the same base station

lower, albeit tight bounds for the ergodic UL capacity of a decoupled cellular
network. The analysis is performed for a scenario consisting of a macro BS and
a set of small cells (SCs) whose positions are selected randomly according to a
Poisson point process of a given spatial density. Based on this analysis simple
bounds in closed form expressions are defined. The devised bounds are employed
to compare the performance of the decoupled case versus a set of benchmark
cases, namely the coupled case, and the situations of having either a single
macro BS or only SCs. This comparison provides valuable insights regarding the
behavior and performance of such networks, providing simpler expressions for
the ergodic UL capacity as a function of the distances to the macro BS and the
density of SCs. These expressions constitute a simple guide to the minimum
degree of densification that guarantees the Quality of Service (QoS) objectives
of the network, thus, providing a valuable tool to the network operator of
significant practical and commercial value.

additional control of quantum degrees of freedom owing to valley-spin locking
of confined carriers near the band edges. However, due to prevailing

space of Riemannian manifolds with uniform Ricci bounds from below. This is the
first observation of orientability for metric measure spaces. Our orientability
has two fundamental properties. One of them is the stability with respect to
noncollapsed sequences. As a corollary we see that if the cross section of a
tangent cone of a noncollapsed limit space of orientable Riemannian manifolds
is smooth, then it is also orientable in the ordinary sense, which can be
regarded as a new obstruction for a given manifold to be the cross section of a
tangent cone. The other one is that there are only two choices for orientations
on a limit space. We also discuss relationships between $L^2$-convergence of
orientations and convergence of currents in metric spaces. In particular for a
noncollapsed sequence, we prove a compatibility between the intrinsic flat
convergence by Sormani-Wenger, the pointed flat convergence by Lang-Wenger, and
the Gromov-Hausdorff convergence, which is a generalization of a recent work by
Matveev-Portegies to the noncompact case. Moreover combining this compatibility
with the second property of our orientation gives an explicit formula for the
limit integral current by using an orientation on a limit space. Finally
dualities between de Rham cohomologies on an oriented limit space are proven.

consequences of these breakings. To asses the impact, we study the influence of
especially parity violation on the propagator for various masses. For this
purpose the functional methods in form of Dyson-Schwinger-Equations are

materials are limited by the number of equations to integrate. Stochastic
simulations are limited by the high frequency of certain events. We propose a
coupling method combining deterministic and stochastic approaches. It allows
handling different time scale phenomena for cluster dynamics. This method,
based on a splitting of the dynamics, is generic and we highlight two different
hybrid deterministic/stochastic methods. These coupling schemes are highly
parallelizable and specifically designed to treat large size cluster problems.
The proof of concept is made on a simple model of vacancy clustering under

distortions to study a class of (parametrised) MG theories that include the
string-inspired Dvali, Gabadadze \& Porrati (DGP) model. Various contributions
from redshift-space distortions are derived in a transparent manner, and
squeezed contributions from these terms are derived separately. Results are

extended to peak-theory based approaches. The {\em cumulant correlators} (CCs)
generalise the ordinary {\em cumulants} and are known to probe collapsed
configurations of higher order correlation functions. We generalise the concept
of CCs to halos of different masses. We also introduce a generating function

unitarity. These estimates and constraints are compared with the values
determined from fits to lattice data of the scattering lengths. Tensions are

summarize work on the central parsec of the Galactic center based on imaging
and spectroscopic observations at the Keck and Gemini telescopes. These
observations include stellar positions in two dimension and the velocity in
three dimensions. Spectroscopic observations also enable measurements of the
physical properties of individual stars, such as the spectral type and in some
cases the effective temperature, metallicity, and surface gravity. We present a
review of our latest measurements of the density profiles and luminosity
functions of the young and old stars in this region. These observations show a
complex stellar population with a young (4-6 Myr) compact star cluster in the
central 0.5 pc embedded in an older and much more massive nuclear star cluster.
Surprisingly, the old late-type giants do not show a cusp profile as long been
expected from theoretical work. The solution to the missing cusp problem may
offer us insight into the dynamical evolution of the cluster. Finally, we also
discuss recent work on the metallicity of stars in this region and how they
might be used to trace their origin. The nuclear star cluster shows a large
variation in metallicity ([M/Fe]). The majority of the stars have higher than
solar metallicity, with about 6\% having [M/Fe] $< -0.5$. These observations
indicate that the NSC was not built from the globular clusters that we see
today. The formation of the nuclear star cluster is more likely from the inward
migration of gas originating in the disk of the Milky Way.

Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) utilizes radiofrequency (r.f.) EM fields to
produce images. Here we present the first visualization of an EM vacuum inside
a bulk metal strip by MRI, amongst several novel findings.
  We uncover unexpected MRI intensity patterns arising from two orthogonal
pairs of faces of a metal strip, and derive formulae for their intensity
ratios, revealing differing effective elemental volumes (voxels) underneath
these faces.
  Further, we furnish chemical shift imaging (CSI) results that discriminate
different faces (surfaces) of a metal block according to their distinct nuclear
magnetic resonance (NMR) chemical shifts, which holds much promise for
monitoring surface chemical reactions noninvasively.
  Bulk metals are ubiquitous, and MRI is a premier noninvasive diagnostic tool.
Combining the two, the emerging field of bulk metal MRI can be expected to grow
in importance. The fundamental nature of results presented here may impactbulk
metal MRI and CSI across many fields.

  Significance of Central Stem Cells in the Crypt","49 pages",,,,"q-bio.TO math.DS","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Rapidly dividing tissues, like intestinal crypts, are frequently chosen to
investigate the process of tumor initiation, because of their high rate of
mutations. To study the interplay between normal and mutant as well as immortal
cells in the human colon or intestinal crypt, we developed a 4-compartmental
stochastic model for cell dynamics based on current discoveries. Recent studies
of the intestinal crypt have revealed the existence of two stem cell groups.
Therefore, our model incorporates two stem cell groups (central stem cells
(CeSCs) and border stem cells (BSCs)), plus one compartment for transit
amplifying (TA) cells and one compartment of fully differentiated (FD) cells.
However, it can be easily modified to have only one stem cell group. We find
that the worst-case scenario occurs when CeSCs are mutated, or an immortal cell
arises in the TA or FD compartments. The probability that the progeny of a
single advantageous CeSC mutant will take over the entire crypt is more than
$0.2$, and one immortal cell always causes all FD cells to become
immortals.Moreover, when CeSCs are either mutants or wild-type (w.t.)
individuals, their progeny will take over the entire crypt in less than 100
days if there is no immortal cell. Unexpectedly, if the CeSCs are wild-type,
then non-immortal mutants with higher fitness are washed out faster than those
with lower fitness. Therefore, we suggest one potential treatment for colon
cancer might be replacing or altering the CeSCs with the normal stem cells.

we wish to argue that advanced technological civilizations would be able to

planetary systems. In particular, we suggest that construction of shielding
swarms of small objects/particles confined by electromagnetic fields could be
one way of mitigating the risk of cosmic explosions and corresponding ionizing
radiation surges. Such feats of astroengineering could, in principle, be
detectable from afar by advanced Dysonian SETI searches.

together to achieve shared objectives. This collaboration is necessary when
coordinated actions benefit the group more than the uncoordinated efforts of
individual firms. Despite the commonly reported benefits that can be gained in
close relationships, recent research has indicated that collaboration attempts
between purchasing firms and their suppliers have not been as widespread as
anticipated. Using a survey of procurement professionals, this research
investigates how the purchasing function utilizes collaboration in its supply
chain relationships. Structural equation modeling is used to identify how
information sharing, decision synchronization, incentive alignment,
collaborative communication, and trust impact collaboration, as well as how
collaboration impacts performance. Results from 86 survey responses indicate
that firms are still not fully utilizing collaborative relationships.
