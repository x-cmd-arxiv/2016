  Contact Stability and Balancing Controllers",,,,,"cs.RO math.OC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Legged locomotion has received increasing attention from the robotics
community. In this respect, contact stability plays a critical role in ensuring
that robots maintain balance, and it is a key element for balancing and walking
controllers. The Center of Pressure is a contact stability criterion that
defines a point that must be kept strictly inside the support polygon in order
to ensure postural stability. In this paper, we introduce the concept of the
sensitivity of the static center of pressure: roughly speaking, the rate of
change of the center of pressure with respect to the system equilibrium
configurations. This new concept can be used as an additional criterion to
assess the robustness of the contact stability. We show how the sensitivity of
the center of pressure can also be used as a metric to assess balancing
controllers by considering two state-of-the-art control strategies. The
analytical analysis is performed on a simplified model, and validated during
balancing tasks on the iCub humanoid robot.

  for VTOL Aerial Robots",,,,,"cs.RO math.OC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In this paper we present a maneuver regulation scheme for Vertical Take-Off
and Landing (VTOL) micro aerial vehicles (MAV). Differently from standard
trajectory tracking, maneuver regulation has an intrinsic robustness due to the
fact that the vehicle is not required to chase a virtual target, but just to
stay on a (properly designed) desired path with a given velocity profile. In
this paper we show how a robust maneuver regulation controller can be easily
designed by converting an existing tracking scheme. The resulting maneuvering
controller has three main appealing features, namely it: (i) inherits the
robustness properties of the tracking controller, (ii) gains the appealing
features of maneuver regulation, and (iii) does not need any additional tuning
with respect to the tracking controller. We prove the correctness of the
proposed scheme and show its effectiveness in experiments on a nano-quadrotor.
In particular, we show on a nontrivial maneuver how external disturbances
acting on the quadrotor cause instabilities in the standard tracking, while
marginally affect the maneuver regulation scheme.

massive ($M_{\star}>10^{10.1}\,M_{\odot}$) cluster galaxies using a sample of
25 clusters over $0.15<z<1$ from the Cluster Lensing And Supernova survey with
Hubble and 11 clusters over $1<z<1.5$ from the IRAC Shallow Cluster Survey.
Galaxy morphologies are determined visually using high-resolution Hubble Space
Telescope images. Using the spectral energy distribution fitting code CIGALE,
we measure star formation rates, stellar masses, and 4000 \AA\ break strengths.
The latter are used to separate quiescent and star-forming galaxies (SFGs).
From $z\sim1.3$ to $z\sim0.2$, the specific star formation rate (sSFR) of
cluster SFGs and quiescent galaxies decreases by factors of three and four,
respectively. Over the same redshift range, the sSFR of the entire cluster
population declines by a factor of 11, from $0.48\pm0.06\;\mathrm{Gyr}^{-1}$ to
$0.043\pm0.009\;\mathrm{Gyr}^{-1}$. This strong overall sSFR evolution is
driven by the growth of the quiescent population over time; the fraction of
quiescent cluster galaxies increases from $28^{+8}_{-19}\%$ to $88^{+5}_{-4}\%$
over $z\sim1.3\rightarrow0.2$. The majority of the growth occurs at
$z\gtrsim0.9$, where the quiescent fraction increases by 0.41. While the sSFR
of the majority of star-forming cluster galaxies is at the level of the field,
a small subset of cluster SFGs have low field-relative star formation activity,
suggestive of long-timescale quenching. The large increase in the fraction of
quiescent galaxies above $z\sim0.9$, coupled with the field-level sSFRs of
cluster SFGs, suggests that higher redshift cluster galaxies are likely being
quenched quickly. Assessing those timescales will require more accurate stellar
population ages and star formation histories.

Automated detection and identification tools need to be developed for solar
features for a deeper understanding of the solar cycle. Of particular interest
here are the dynamical properties of the ARs, regardless of their internal
structure and sunspot distribution. We studied the oscillatory dynamics of two
ARs: NOAA 11327 and NOAA 11726 using two different methods of pattern
recognition. We developed a novel method of automated AR border detection and
compared it to an existing method for the proof-of-concept. The first method
uses least-squares fitting on the smallest ellipse enclosing the AR, while the
second method applies regression on the convex hull.} After processing the
data, we found that the axes and the inclination angle of the ellipse and the
convex hull oscillate in time. These oscillations are interpreted as the second
harmonic of the standing long-period kink oscillations (with the node at the
apex) of the magnetic flux tube connecting the two main sunspots of the ARs. In
both ARs we have estimated the distribution of the phase speed magnitude along
the magnetic tubes (along the two main spots) by interpreting the obtained
oscillation of the inclination angle as the standing second harmonic kink mode.
After comparing the obtained results for fast and slow kink modes, we conclude
that both of these modes are good candidates to explain the observed
oscillations of the AR inclination angles, as in the high plasma $\beta$ regime
the phase speeds of these modes are comparable and on the order of the
Alfv\'{e}n speed. Based on the properties of the observed oscillations, we
detected the appropriate depth of the sunspot patterns, which coincides with
estimations made by helioseismic methods. The latter analysis can be used as a
basis for developing a magneto-seismological tool for ARs.

challenge. Previously, metrics such as bandwidth or latency have commonly been

a metric to compare FIAs. While low power consumption is an important goal in
its own right (as lower energy use translates to smaller environmental impact
as well as lower operating costs), power consumption can also serve as a proxy
for other metrics such as bandwidth and processor load.
  Lacking power consumption statistics about either commodity FIA routers or
widely deployed FIA testbeds, we propose models for power consumption of FIA
routers. Based on our models, we simulate scenarios for measuring power
consumption of content delivery in different FIAs. Specifically, we address two
questions: 1) which of the proposed FIA candidates achieves the lowest energy
footprint; and 2) which set of design choices yields a power-efficient network
architecture? Although the lack of real-world data makes numerous assumptions
necessary for our analysis, we explore the uncertainty of our calculations

optical-overlap, the surface roughness at the silica cladding struts and the
presence of interface-modes limited the lowest reported transmission-loss to
1.2 dB/km at 1550 nm. This hope is recently revived by the introduction of
hypocycloid core- contour (i.e. negative curvature) in inhibited-coupling (IC)
guiding HC-PCF, and the reduction of their confinement loss to a level that
makes them serious contenders for light transmission below the SRSL in UV-
VIS-NIR spectral range. Here, we report on several IC guiding HC-PCFs with a
hypocycloid core-contour and a cladding structure made of a single ring from a
tubular lattice. The fibers guide in the UV-VIS and NIR, and among which we
list one with a record transmission loss of 7.7 dB/km at ~750 nm (only a factor
~2 above the SRSL), and a second with an ultra-broad fundamental-band with loss
in the range of 10-20 dB/km spanning from 600 to 1200 nm. Both fibers present
near-single mode guidance and very low bend loss sensitivity. The results show
that the limit in the transmission is set by confinement loss for wavelengths
longer than ~1 {\mu}m and by surface- roughness for shorter wavelengths, thus
indicating that transmission loss well below the SRSL in the visible is
possible with a surface roughness reduction and would open the possibility of

response variable to a set of predictors are to fit a marginal model using
generalized estimating equations and to fit a generalized linear mixed model by
introducing latent random variables. The first approach is effective for
parameter estimation, but leaves one without a formal model for the data with
which to assess quality of fit or make predictions for future observations. The
second approach overcomes the deficiencies of the first, but leads to parameter

complicating matters, obtaining marginal summaries from a generalized linear

marginally interpretable generalized linear mixed models that lead to parameter
estimates with a marginal interpretation while maintaining the desirable

results have been a direct observation of non-diffusive phonon-mediated
transport at room temperature and measurements of thickness-dependent thermal
conductivity of suspended membranes across a wide thickness range, showing good
agreement with first-principles-based theory assuming diffuse scattering at the

a critical free-fermion chain starting from a step-like initial state. The

of magnetocaloric materials. It has been applied to a wide variety of pure
elements and compounds, ranging from rare earth-based materials to transition
metal alloys, from bulk crystalline samples to nanoparticles. It is therefore
necessary to quantify the limits within which the scaling laws would remain
applicable for magnetocaloric research. For this purpose, a threefold approach
has been followed: a) the magnetocaloric responses of a set of materials with
Curie temperatures ranging from 46 to 336 K have been modeled with a mean-field
Brillouin model, b) experimental data for Gd has been analyzed, and c) a
3D-Ising model ---which is beyond the mean-field approximation--- has been
studied. In this way we can demonstrate that the conclusions extracted in this
work are model-independent. It is found that universal scaling remains
applicable up to applied fields which provide a magnetic energy to the system
up to 8\% of the thermal energy at the Curie temperature. In this range, the
predicted deviations from scaling laws remain below the experimental error
margin of carefully performed experiments. Therefore, for materials whose Curie
temperature is close to room temperature, scaling laws at the Curie temperature
would be applicable for the magnetic field range available at conventional
magnetism laboratories ($\sim 10$ T), well above the fields which are usually
available for magnetocaloric devices.

this article two main results can be found, being both strongly correlated.
Primarily, the more formal result involves the development of a
first-principles canonical quantization formalism to study the vacuum in
presence different dissipative bodies in completely general scenarios. We
considered a one-dimensional quantum scalar field interacting with the volume
elements' degrees of freedom of the material bodies, which are modeled as
composite systems consisting in a harmonic oscillators interacting with an
environment. Solving the full dynamics of the composite system through its
Heisenberg equations, we studied each contribution to the field operator by
employing general properties of the Green function. We deduced the long-time
limit of the field operator. In agreement with previous works, we showed that
the expectation values of the components of the energy-momentum tensor present
two contributions, one associated to the thermal baths and the other one
associated to the field's initial conditions. This allows us to the direct
study of steady situations involving different initial states for the field and
arbitrary thermal states for the baths. This leads to the other main result,
consisting in computing the Casimir force when the field is initially in
thermal or continuum-single-mode squeezed states (characterized by a given
bandwidth and frequency). Time-averaging is required for the squeezed case,
showing both results in a unified way. For the thermal state, all the
well-known equilibrium results can be successfully reproduced. Finally, we
compared the initial conditions' contribution and the total force for each
case, showing that the latter can be tuned in a wide range of values through
varying the size of the bandwidth.

give half metallic characteristic with a small gap of $\sim$50 meV for down

almost linear values of $\tau_{up}$ and a non-linear values of $\tau_{dn}$ are

values of $\alpha$ using two current model are found to be in good agreement

Methods based on partitioning take a very important place among them. In this
paper we propose a new approach to signature partitioning. Its most important
feature is the possibility of selecting and processing of hybrid partitions in
order to increase a precision of the test signature analysis. Partitions are
formed by a combination of vertical and horizontal sections of the signature.
Vertical sections correspond to the initial, middle, and final time moments of
the signing process. In turn, horizontal sections correspond to the signature
areas associated with high and low pen velocity and high and low pen pressure
on the surface of a graphics tablet. Our previous research on vertical and
horizontal sections of the dynamic signature (created independently) led us to
develop the algorithm presented in this paper. Selection of sections, among
others, allows us to define the stability of the signing process in the
partitions, promoting signature areas of greater stability (and vice versa). In
the test of the proposed method two databases were used: public MCYT-100 and
paid BioSecure.

discovery that AGN jets are bright X-ray emitters on very large scales, up to
hundreds of kpc. Of these, the powerful and beamed jets of Flat Spectrum Radio
Quasars are particularly interesting, as the X-ray emission cannot be explained
by an extrapolation of the lower frequency synchrotron spectrum. Instead, the
most common model invokes inverse Compton scattering of photons of the Cosmic
Microwave Background (EC/CMB) as the mechanism responsible for the high energy
emission. The EC/CMB model has recently come under criticism, particularly
because it should predict a significant steady flux in the MeV-GeV band which
has not been detected by the Fermi/LAT telescope for two of the best studied
jets (PKS 0637-752 and 3C273). In this work we revisit some aspects of the
EC/CMB model and show that electron cooling plays an important part in shaping
the spectrum. This can solve the overproduction of gamma-rays by suppressing
the high energy end of the emitting particle population. Furthermore, we show
that cooling in the EC/CMB model predicts a new class of extended jets that are
bright in X-rays but silent in the radio and optical bands. These jets are more
likely to lie at intermediate redshifts, and would have been missed in all
previous X-ray surveys due to selection effects.

very fine scale (below the resolution limit of the current largest telescope)

constrained by the need to modulate the light before it enters the telescope

polarization which will enable us to carry out high accurate polarimetric

interactions. It has the peculiar feature of dramatically amplifying small
perturbations, and rather than driving the system to equilibrium it instead
leads to slowly evolving configurations known as quasi-stationary states that
fall outside the standard paradigm of statistical mechanics. Violent relaxation
was originally identified in gravity-driven stellar dynamics; here we extend
the theory into the quantum regime by developing a quantum version of the
Hamiltonian Mean Field (HMF) model which exemplifies many of the generic
properties of long-range interacting systems. The HMF model can either be
viewed as describing particles interacting via a cosine potential, or
equivalently as the kinetic XY-model with infinite range interactions, and its
quantum fluid dynamics can be obtained from a generalized Gross-Pitaevskii
equation. We show that singular caustics that form during violent relaxation
are regulated by interference effects in a universal way described by Thom's
catastrophe theory applied to waves and this leads to emergent length and time
scales not present in the classical problem. In the deep quantum regime we find
that violent relaxation is suppressed altogether by quantum zero-point motion.
Our results are relevant to laboratory studies of self-organization in cold
atomic gases with long-range interactions.

considered model, the network can leverage human-centric information such as
users' visited locations, requested contents, gender, job, and device type to
predict the content request distribution and mobility pattern of each user.
Then, given these behavior predictions, the proposed approach seeks to find the
user-UAV associations, the optimal UAVs' locations, and the contents to cache
at UAVs. This problem is formulated as an optimization problem whose goal is to
maximize the users' QoE while minimizing the transmit power used by the UAVs.
To solve this problem, a novel algorithm based on the machine learning
framework of conceptor-based echo state networks (ESNs) is proposed. Using
ESNs, the network can effectively predict each user's content request

users and the network is available. Based on the predictions of the users'
content request distribution and their mobility patterns, we derive the optimal
user-UAV association, optimal locations of the UAVs as well as the content to

neural network model that marries together ideas from two prominent strands of
research on domain adaptation through representation learning: structural
correspondence learning (SCL, (Blitzer et al., 2006)) and autoencoder neural
networks. Particularly, our model is a three-layer neural network that learns
to encode the nonpivot features of an input example into a low-dimensional
representation, so that the existence of pivot features (features that are
prominent in both domains and convey useful information for the NLP task) in
the example can be decoded from that representation. The low-dimensional
representation is then employed in a learning algorithm for the task. Moreover,
we show how to inject pre-trained word embeddings into our model in order to
improve generalization across examples with similar pivot features. On the task
of cross-domain product sentiment classification (Blitzer et al., 2007),
consisting of 12 domain pairs, our model outperforms both the SCL and the

latter were, respectively, smooth semi-algebraic sets of codimension
$\Theta(k^2)$ and semi-algebraic sets of codimension $\Theta(k)$, the sets
$C_k$ are semi-algebraic and have codimension $2$, yielding the best possible
lower bound valid for all $k$ on the size of the cut locus of $\mathbb{G}_k$.
  Furthermore, we study the relation of the cut locus with the so-called

\mathrm{Abn}_0(\mathbb{G}_k) = \overline{\mathrm{Cut}_0(\mathbb{G}_k)}

there are plenty of abnormal geodesics with finite cut time.
  Finally, and as a straightforward consequence of our results, we derive an
explicit lower bound for the small time heat kernel asymptotics at the points
of $C_k$.
  The question whether $C_k$ coincides with the cut locus for $k\geq 4$ remains

radiating significantly below its Eddington limit (~10^-6 L_Edd), and the soft
spectrum resembles other weakly accreting massive BHs including Sagittarius A*.

detection of a ~9-hour periodicity, although additional observations are

radiative cooling, star formation, supernova feedback, BH accretion and
feedback. In the absence of such processes, the orbit of the secondary BH
decays over timescales of ~10 Myr to the center of the CND, where the primary
BH resides. When strong dissipation operates in CNDs, fragmentation into
massive objects the size of giant molecular clouds and with densities in the
range 10^4 - 10^7 amu / cm^3 occurs, causing stochastic torques and hits that
can eject the secondary BH from the midplane. Outside the plane, the
low-density medium provides only weak drag, and the BH return is governed by
inefficient dynamical friction. In rare cases, clump-BH interactions can lead
to a faster decay. Feedback processes lead to outflows, but do not change
significantly the overall density of the CND midplane. However, with a
spherically distributed BH feedback a hot bubble is generated behind the
secondary, which almost shuts off dynamical friction, a phenomenon we dub ""wake
evacuation"", leading to delays in the decay of possibly ~0.3 Gyr. We discuss
the non-trivial implications on the discovery space of the eLISA telescope. Our

luminosity above which the AGN becomes powerful enough to launch winds that
will be able to escape the galaxy potential. In this paper, we present pilot
observations of two AGN in this transitional range that were taken with the

Instability. This instability may evolve into dust-trapping vortices that might
explain the ""banana-shaped"" features in recently observed asymmetric transition
discs with inner cavities. Previous hydrodynamical simulations of
planet-induced vortices have neglected the timescale of hundreds to thousands
of orbits to grow a massive planet to Jupiter-size. In this work, we study the
effect of a giant planet's runaway growth timescale on the lifetime and
characteristics of the resulting vortex. For two different planet masses (1 and
5 Jupiter masses) and two different disc viscosities ($\alpha$=3$\times
10^{-4}$ and 3$\times10^{-5}$), we compare the vortices induced by planets with
several different growth timescales between 10 and 4000 planet orbits. In
general, we find that slowly-growing planets create significantly weaker
vortices with lifetimes and surface densities reduced by more than $50\%$. For
the higher disc viscosity, the longest growth timescales in our study inhibit
vortex formation altogether. Additionally, slowly-growing planets produce
vortices that are up to twice as elongated, with azimuthal extents well above
$180^{\circ}$ in some cases. These unique, elongated vortices likely create a
distinct signature in the dust observations that differentiates them from the
more concentrated vortices that correspond to planets with faster growth
timescales. Lastly, we find that the low viscosities necessary for vortex
formation likely prevent planets from growing quickly enough to trigger the
instability in self-consistent models.

contemporary neutrino data, as it allows to study the properties of the
astrophysical components of the high-energy flux detected by the IceCube

model of the high-energy neutrino background by assuming two main
extra-galactic components: star-forming galaxies and blazars. By leveraging
multi-wavelength data from Herschel and Fermi, we predict the spectral and
anisotropic probability distributions for their expected neutrino counts in
IceCube. We find that star-forming galaxies are likely to remain a diffuse
background due to the poor angular resolution of IceCube, and we determine an
upper limit on the number of shower events that can reasonably be associated to
blazars. We also find that upper limits on the contribution of blazars to the
measured flux are unfavourably affected by the skewness of the blazar flux
distribution. One-point event clustering and likelihood analyses of the IceCube
HESE data suggest that this method has the potential to dramatically improve
over more conventional model-based analyses, especially for the next generation

In fact, due to the high cadence and quality of our data, it is the first time

inside the core of each sodium D-line. We model the effects of external sources
on the excess light-curves, which correspond to an observed stellar flare
beginning close to mid-transit time and the wavelength dependent limb-darkening
effects. In addition, by characterizing the effect of the changing radial
velocity and Doppler shifts of the planetary sodium lines inside the stellar
sodium lines, we estimate the depth and width of the exoplanetary sodium
feature. We estimate the shape of the planetary sodium line by a Gaussian
profile, with an equivalent width of 0.0023 \pm 0.0010 \AA, thereby confirming
the presence of sodium in the atmosphere of HD189733b with excess absorption

experimental investigations of MBL, since no realistic system can ever be fully

04166+2706 protostar. This Taurus protostar drives a molecular jet that
contains multiple emission peaks symmetrically located from the central source.
The protostar also drives a wide-angle outflow consisting of two conical
shells.
  $Methods.$ We have used the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array
(ALMA) interferometer to observe two fields along the IRAS 04166+2706 jet. The
fields were centered on a pair of emission peaks that correspond to the same
ejection event, and were observed in CO(2-1), SiO(5-4), and SO(65-54).
  $ Results.$ Both ALMA fields present spatial distributions that are
approximately elliptical and have their minor axes aligned with the jet
direction. As the velocity increases, the emission in each field moves
gradually across the elliptical region. This systematic pattern indicates that
the emitting gas in each field lies in a disk-like structure that is
perpendicular to the jet axis and is expanding away from the jet. A small
degree of curvature in the first-moment maps indicates that the disks are
slightly curved in the manner expected for bow shocks moving away from the IRAS
source. A simple geometrical model confirms that this scenario fits the main
emission features.
  $Conclusions.$ The emission peaks in the IRAS 04166+2706 jet likely represent
internal bow shocks where material is being ejected laterally away from the jet
axis. While the linear momentum of the ejected gas is dominated by the
component in the jet direction, the sideways component is not negligible, and
can potentially affect the distribution of gas in the surrounding outflow and
core.

important, the bulk flow saturates via the combined processes of reducing the
background shear and rearranging and strengthening the background vertical
magnetic field. We directly simulate the Ginzburg-Landau amplitude evolution

redshifts. However, the faint side of the QLF at high redshifts is still too
uncertain. An accurate estimate of the survey completeness is essential to
derive an accurate QLF for use in studying the luminosity-dependent density
evolution of the quasar population. Here we investigate how the luminosity
dependence of quasar spectra (the Baldwin effect) and the attenuation model for
the inter-galactic medium (IGM) affect the completeness estimates. For this
purpose, we revisit the completeness of quasar surveys specifically at
$z\sim4-5$, using the COSMOS images observed with Subaru/Suprime-Cam. As the
result, we find that the completeness estimates are sensitive to the luminosity
dependence of the quasar spectrum and difference in the IGM attenuation models.
At $z\sim4$, the number density of quasars when we adopt the latest IGM model
and take the luminosity dependence of spectra into account are
$(3.49\pm1.62)\times10^{-7}$ Mpc$^{-3}$ mag$^{-1}$ for $-24.09<M_{1450}<-23.09$
and $(5.24\pm2.13)\times10^{-7}$ Mpc$^{-3}$ mag$^{-1}$ for

$1\sigma$ confidence upper limit of the number density at

estimated previously. The results suggest that the luminosity dependence of the
quasar spectrum and the IGM model are important for deriving accurate number
density of high-$z$ quasars. Even taking these effects into account, the
inferred luminosity-dependent density evolution of quasars is consistent with
the AGN down-sizing evolutionary picture.

Competing theories can be divided into internal (inside-out), in which internal
physical processes transform or maintain the NCC phase, and external
(outside-in), in which the cluster type is determined by its initial
conditions, which in turn lead to different formation histories (i.e., assembly
bias). We propose a new method that uses the relative assembly bias of CC to
NCC clusters, as determined via the two-point cluster-galaxy cross-correlation
function (CCF), to test whether formation history plays a role in determining
their nature. We apply our method to 48 ACCEPT clusters, which have well
resolved central entropies, and cross-correlate with the SDSS-III/BOSS LOWZ
galaxy catalog. We find that the relative bias of NCC over CC clusters is $b =
1.42 \pm 0.35$ ($1.6\sigma$ different from unity). Our measurement is limited
by the small number of clusters with core entropy information within the BOSS
footprint, 14 CC and 34 NCC. Future compilations of X-ray cluster samples,
combined with deep all-sky redshift surveys, will be able to better constrain
the relative assembly bias of CC and NCC clusters and determine the origin of
the bimodality.

timescales, between rotation-powered radio millisecond pulsar (RMSP) and
accretion-powered low-mass X-ray binary (LMXB) states. The tMSPs have raised
several questions related to the nature of accretion flow in their LMXB state
and the mechanism that causes the state switch. The discovery of coherent X-ray
pulsations from PSR J1023+0038 (while in the LMXB state) provides us with the
first opportunity to perform timing observations and to compare the neutron
star's spin variation during this state to the measured spin-down in the RMSP
state. Whereas the X-ray pulsations in the LMXB state likely indicate that some
material is accreting onto the neutron star's magnetic polar caps, radio
continuum observations indicate the presence of an outflow. The fraction of the
inflowing material being ejected is not clear, but it may be much larger than
that reaching the neutron star's surface. Timing observations can measure the
total torque on the neutron star. We have phase-connected nine XMM-Newton
observations of PSR J1023+0038 over the last 2.5 years of the LMXB state to
establish a precise measurement of spin evolution. We find that the average
spin-down rate as an LMXB is 26.8+/-0.4% faster than the rate (-2.39x10^-15 Hz
s-1) determined during the RMSP state. This shows that negative angular
momentum contributions (dipolar magnetic braking and outflow) exceed positive
ones (accreted material), and suggests that the pulsar wind continues to
operate at a largely unmodified level. We discuss implications of this tight
observational constraint in the context of possible accretion models.

are mild but significant discrepancies, such as too many high-SFR galaxies,
overly metal-rich and HI-poor galaxies at M*>10^{10} Mo, and sSFRs that are too
low at z~1-2. The HI mass function increases by x2 out to z~1 then steepens to
higher redshifts, while the CO luminosity function computed using the Narayanan

z~2 in accord with data. Omega_HI and Omega_H2 both scale roughly as (1+z)^0.7
out to z~3, comparable to the rise in HI and H2 fractions. MUFASA galaxies with
high SFR at a given M* have lower metallicities and higher HI and H2 fractions,
following observed trends; we make quantitative predictions for how
fluctuations in the baryon cycle drive correlated scatter around galaxy scaling
relations. Most of these trends are well converged with numerical resolution.

emission-line regions with large velocity offsets (up to 1500 km/s) and line

finite disorder correlation length. We focus our approach on the scalings of
its geometrical fluctuations as a function of its length. At large
lengthscales, the roughness of the interface, defined as the variance of its
endpoint fluctuations, follows a power-law behaviour whose exponent
characterises its superdiffusive behaviour. In 1+1 dimensions, the roughness
exponent is known to be the characteristic 2/3 exponent of the
Kardar-Parisi-Zhang (KPZ) universality class. An important feature of the model
description is that its Flory exponent, obtained by a power counting argument
on its Hamiltonian, is equal to 3/5 and thus does not yield the correct KPZ
roughness exponent. In this work, we review the available power-counting
options, and relate the physical validity of the exponent values that they
predict, to the existence (or not) of well-defined optimal trajectories in a
large-size or low-temperature asymptotics. We identify the crucial role of the
'cut-off' lengths of the problem (the disorder correlation length and the
system size), which one has to carefully follow throughout the scaling
analysis. To complement the latter, we device a novel Gaussian Variational
Method (GVM) scheme to compute the roughness, taking into account the effect of
a large but finite interface length. Interestingly, such a procedure yields the
correct KPZ roughness exponent, instead of the Flory exponent usually obtained
through the GVM approach for an infinite interface. We explain the physical
origin of this improvement of the GVM procedure and discuss possible extensions

revealed the presence of weak narrow nebular emission features from the

detected at the time of the re-brightening disfavors the shock interaction
scenario as the source of energy powering the long-lived UV emission, while
deep radio limits exclude the presence of relativistic jets propagating into a
low-density environment. We propose a model where the extreme luminosity and
double-peaked temporal structure of ASASSN-15lh is powered by a central source
of ionizing radiation that produces a sudden change of the ejecta opacity at
later times. As a result, UV radiation can more easily escape, producing the
second bump in the light-curve. We discuss different interpretations for the
intrinsic nature of the ionizing source. We conclude that, IF the X-ray source
is physically associated with the optical-UV transient, ASASSN-15lh most likely
represents the tidal disruption of a main-sequence star by the most massive
spinning black hole detected to date. In this case, ASASSN-15lh and similar

universal feature of active fluids and has been extensively studied in recent
years. Similar to microrheology for equilibrium complex fluids, the unusual
enhanced particle dynamics reveal intrinsic properties of active fluids.
Nevertheless, previous studies have shown that the translational dynamics of
spherical tracers are qualitatively similar, independent of whether active
particles are pushers or pullers---the two fundamental classes of active
fluids. Is it possible to distinguish pushers from pullers by simply imaging
the dynamics of passive tracers? Here, we investigated the diffusion of
isolated ellipsoids in algal C. reinhardtii suspensions---a model for
puller-type active fluids. In combination with our previous results on
pusher-type E. coli suspensions [Peng et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 116, 068303
(2016)], we showed that the dynamics of asymmetric tracers show a profound
difference in pushers and pullers due to their rotational degree of freedom.
Although the laboratory-frame translation and rotation of ellipsoids are
enhanced in both pushers and pullers, similar to spherical tracers, the
anisotropic diffusion in the body frame of ellipsoids shows opposite trends in
the two classes of active fluids. An ellipsoid diffuses fastest along its major
axis when immersed in pullers, whereas it diffuses slowest along the major axis
in pushers. This striking difference can be qualitatively explained using a
simple hydrodynamic model. In addition, our study on algal suspensions reveals
that the influence of the near-field advection of algal swimming flows on the
translation and rotation of ellipsoids shows different ranges and strengths.
Our work provides not only new insights into universal organizing principles of

0.2 - 10$ planetary mass clumps per star being born in young gravitationally
unstable discs. A trio of processes -- rapid clump migration, tidal disruption
and runaway gas accretion -- destroys or transforms all of the simulated clumps
into other objects, resulting in a desert of gas giants beyond separation of
approximately 10 au. The cooling rate of the disc controls which of the three
processes is dominant. For cooling rates faster than a few local dynamical
times, clumps always grow rapidly and become massive brown dwarfs or low mass
stars. For longer cooling times, post-collapse (high density) planets migrate
inward to $\sim 10-20$ au where they open a gap in the disc and then continue
to migrate inward much less rapidly. Pre-collapse (low density) planets are
tidally disrupted and may leave massive solid cores behind. Gas giant planets
observed inside the desert, such as those in HR 8799, must have followed an
unusual evolutionary path, e.g., their host disc being dispersed in a
catastrophic fashion.

thresholds at which small changes in the external inputs or in the systems

dynamical behavior. While tipping in a fold bifurcation of an equilibrium is
well understood, much less is known about tipping of oscillations (limit
cycles) though this dynamics are the typical response of many natural systems
to a periodic external forcing, like e.g. seasonal forcing in ecology and
climate sciences. We provide a detailed analysis of tipping phenomena in
periodically forced systems and show that, when limit cycles are considered, a
transient structure, so-called channel, plays a fundamental role in the
transition. Specifically, we demonstrate that trajectories crossing such
channel conserve, for a characteristic time, the twisting behavior of the
stable limit cycle destroyed in the fold bifurcation of cycles. As a
consequence, this channel acts like a ghost of the limit cycle destroyed in the
critical transition and instead of the expected abrupt transition we find a
smooth one. This smoothness is also the reason that it is difficult to
precisely determine the transition point employing the usual indicators of
tipping points, like critical slowing down and flickering.

$p$. When $p<\frac{1}{2}$, this algorithm generates sparse networks, in which
the average node degree is finite. A power-law degree distribution also arises,
with a non-universal exponent whose value is determined by a transcendental
equation in $p$. In the sparse regime, the network is ""normal"", e.g., the
relative fluctuations in the number of links are asymptotically negligible. For
$p\geq \frac{1}{2}$, the emergent networks are dense (the average degree
increases with the number of nodes $N$) and they exhibit intriguing structural
behaviors. In particular, the $N$-dependence of the number of $m$-cliques
(complete subgraphs of $m$ nodes) undergoes $m-1$ transitions from normal to
progressively more anomalous behavior at a $m$-dependent critical values of
$p$. Different realizations of the network, which start from the same initial
state, exhibit macroscopic fluctuations in the thermodynamic limit---absence of
self averaging. When linking to second neighbors of the target node can occur,
the number of links asymptotically grows as $N^2$ as $N\to\infty$, so that the
network is effectively complete as $N\to \infty$.

computational advantages over classical proof strings. In the interactive proof

during an interaction for a given input string, giving rise to quantum
complexity classes such as QIP, QSZK, and QMIP* that represent natural quantum

games, and achieve an interpretation of dependent types and the hierarchy of
universes in an intuitive yet mathematically precise manner, our strategies can

the beam passes through a light diffuser. We demonstrate that the spatial
intensity correlations of the speckle patterns are independent of the light
diffusers, and are solely determined by the phase changes of an incident beam.
With numerical simulations using the random matrix theory, and an experimental
pressure-driven wavefront-deforming setup using a microfluidic channel, we
theoretically and experimentally confirm the universal sensitivity of speckle
intensity correlations, which is attributed to the conservation of optical
field correlation despite multiple light scattering. This work demonstrates
that a complex media is a simple interferometer, and presents opportunities to
replace complicated reference-beam-assisted interferometers with a simple and

the presence of a degenerate electron gas, such excitons dissociate due to free

Consequently, we show that a degenerate, three-dimensional electron gas
stabilizes a novel class of quasiparticles, named collexons, by many-particle

of collexons and their stabilisation with rising doping concentration, is
facilitated by a superior crystal quality due to perfect substitution of the

Historical methods that address such a problem are often framed to leverage
only a single classifier, or specific set of classifiers. These works are often
accompanied by naive assumptions. In this work we propose generalized inverse
classification (GIC), which avoids restricting the classification model that

GIC takes place. Under this framework, GIC operates on features that are
immediately actionable. Each change incurs an individual cost, either linear or
non-linear. Such changes are subjected to occur within a specified level of
cumulative change (budget). Furthermore, our framework incorporates the
estimation of features that change as a consequence of direct actions taken
(indirectly changeable features). To solve such a problem, we propose three
real-valued heuristic-based methods and two sensitivity analysis-based
comparison methods, each of which is evaluated on two freely available
real-world datasets. Our results demonstrate the validity and benefits of our

suspension of cornstarch in water. We performed 2 types of relaxation
experiments starting from a steady shear in a parallel plate rheometer,
followed by either stopping the top plate rotation and measuring the transient
torque relaxation, or removing the torque on the plate and measuring the
transient tool rotation. We found that at low weight fraction
$\phi_{eff}<58.8\pm0.4\%$, the suspensions exhibited a relaxation behavior
consistent with a generalized Newtonian fluid. However, for larger weight
fraction $58.8\% < \phi_{eff} < 61.0\%$, near the liquid-solid transition
$\phi_c=61.0\pm0.7\%$, we found relaxation behaviors different from the
generalized Newtonian model. The relaxation time in this range scales with the
inverse of the critical shear rate at the onset of shear thickening. In this
range the relaxation time was the same in both stress and rate controlled
experiments, rather than the viscosity calculated from the relaxation time
which is expected to be intrinsic material parameter in the generalized
Newtonian model. The discrepancy between the measured relaxation times and the
generalized Newtonian prediction was found to be up to $10^4$, and
extrapolations diverge in the limit of $\phi_c$ as the generalized Newtonian
prediction approaches 0. At the highest weight fractions, the relaxation time
scales were measured to be on the order of $\sim 1$ s. The fact that this
timescale is resolvable by the naked eye may be important to understanding some
of the dynamic phenomenon commonly observed in these systems. We also showed
that using the critical shear rate $\dot\gamma_c$ at the onset of shear
thickening to characterize the effective weight fraction can more precisely
characterize material properties near the critical point $\phi_c$, allowing us
to resolve this transition so close to $\phi_c$.

atmosphere. Observations of a large high- to low- phase brightness ratio,
combined with the blue color of the haze, suggest that the haze particles are
fractal aggregates, analogous to the photochemical hazes on Titan. Therefore,
studying the Pluto hazes can shed light on the similarities and differences
between the Pluto and Titan atmospheres. We model the haze distribution using
the Community Aerosol and Radiation Model for Atmospheres assuming that the
distribution is shaped by sedimentation and coagulation of particles
originating from photochemistry. Hazes composed of both purely spherical and
purely fractal aggregate particles are considered. Agreement between model
results and occultation observations is obtained with aggregate particles when
the downward flux of photochemical products is equal to the column-integrated
methane destruction rate ~1.2 $\times$ 10$^{-14}$ g cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$, while
for spherical particles the mass flux must be 2-3 times greater. This flux is
nearly identical to the haze production flux of Titan previously obtained by
comparing microphysical model results to Cassini observations. The aggregate
particle radius is sensitive to particle charging, and a particle charge to
radius ratio of 30 e-/{\mu}m is necessary to produce ~0.1-0.2 {\mu}m aggregates
near Pluto's surface, in accordance with forward scattering measurements. Such
a particle charge to radius ratio is 2-4 times higher than those previously
obtained for Titan. Hazes composed of spheres with the same particle charge to
radius ratio have particles that are 4 times smaller. These results further
suggest that the haze particles are fractal aggregates. We also consider the
effect of condensation of HCN, and C$_{2}$-hydrocarbons on the haze particles,
which may play an important role in shaping their distributions.

(MUSE) at the Very Large Telescope (VLT) reveal the detailed three-dimensional
structure of eta Car's outer ejecta. Morpho-kinematic modeling of these ejecta
is conducted with the code SHAPE. Results. The largest coherent structure in
eta Car's outer ejecta can be described as a bent cylinder with roughly the
same symmetry axis as the Homunculus nebula. This large outer shell is
interacting with the surrounding medium, creating soft X-ray emission. We
establish the shape and extent of the ghost shell in front of the southern
Homunculus lobe and confirm that the NN condensation can best be modeled as a
bowshock in the orbital/equatorial plane. Conclusions. The SHAPE modeling of
the MUSE observations indicates that the kinematics of the outer ejecta
measured with MUSE can be described by a spatially coherent structure, and this
structure also correlates with the extended soft X-ray emission associated with
the outer debris field. The ghost shell just outside the southern Homunculus
lobe hints at a sequence of eruptions within the time frame of the Great
Eruption from 1837-1858 or possibly a later shock/reverse shock velocity
separation. Our 3D morpho-kinematic modeling and the MUSE observations
constitute an invaluable dataset to be confronted with future
radiation-hydrodynamics simulations. Such a comparison may shed light on the
yet elusive physical mechanism responsible for eta Car-like eruptions.

multidimensional data. In this paper, we study the low-tubal-rank tensor
completion problem, i.e., to recover a third-order tensor by observing a subset
of its elements selected uniformly at random. We propose a fast iterative
algorithm, called {\em Tubal-Alt-Min}, that is inspired by a similar approach
for low-rank matrix completion. The unknown low-tubal-rank tensor is
represented as the product of two much smaller tensors with the low-tubal-rank
property being automatically incorporated, and Tubal-Alt-Min alternates between
estimating those two tensors using tensor least squares minimization. First, we
note that tensor least squares minimization is different from its matrix
counterpart and nontrivial as the circular convolution operator of the
low-tubal-rank tensor model is intertwined with the sub-sampling operator.
Second, the theoretical performance guarantee is challenging since
Tubal-Alt-Min is iterative and nonconvex in nature. We prove that 1)
Tubal-Alt-Min guarantees exponential convergence to the global optima, and 2)
for an $n \times n \times k$ tensor with tubal-rank $r \ll n$, the required
sampling complexity is $O(nr^2k \log^3 n)$ and the computational complexity is
$O(n^2rk^2 \log^2 n)$. Third, on both synthetic data and real-world video data,
evaluation results show that compared with tensor-nuclear norm minimization
(TNN-ADMM), Tubal-Alt-Min improves the recovery error dramatically (by orders
of magnitude). It is estimated that Tubal-Alt-Min converges at an exponential
rate $10^{-0.4423 \text{Iter}}$ where $\text{Iter}$ denotes the number of
iterations, which is much faster than TNN-ADMM's $10^{-0.0332 \text{Iter}}$,

identical natural frequency, we show that the total mass distribution
concentrates on the average phase asymptotically, whereas the mass around the
antipodal point of the average phase decays to zero exponentially fast in any
positive coupling strength regime. Thus, generic initial kinetic densities
evolve toward the Dirac measure concentrated on the average phase. In contrast,
for the infinite ensemble with distributed natural frequencies, we find a
certain time-dependent interval whose length can be explicitly quantified in
terms of the coupling strength. Provided that the coupling strength is
sufficiently large, the mass on such an interval is eventually non-decreasing
over the time. We also show that the amplitude order parameter has a positive
lower bound that depends on the size of support of the distribution function
for the natural frequencies and the coupling strength. The proposed asymptotic
lower bound on the order parameter tends to unity, as the coupling strength
increases to infinity. This is reminiscent of practical synchronization for the
Kuramoto model, in which the diameter for the phase configuration is inversely

other deep network based saliency models which infer saliency in local
contexts, DSCLRCN can mimic the cortical lateral inhibition mechanisms in human
visual system to incorporate global contexts to assess the saliency of each
image location by leveraging the deep spatial long short-term memory (DSLSTM)
model. Moreover, we also integrate scene context modulation in DSLSTM for
saliency inference, leading to a novel deep spatial contextual LSTM (DSCLSTM)
model. The whole network can be trained end-to-end and works efficiently when
testing. Experimental results on two benchmark datasets show that DSCLRCN can
achieve state-of-the-art performance on saliency detection. Furthermore, the
proposed DSCLSTM model can significantly boost the saliency detection
performance by incorporating both global spatial interconnections and scene
context modulation, which may uncover novel inspirations for studies on them in
computational saliency models.

As stressed by Landauer,
however, noise can be an invaluable signal that reveals kinetics of charge
particles. Understanding local non-equilibrium electron kinetics at nano-scale
is of decisive importance for the development of miniaturized electronic
devices, optical nano-devices, and heat management devices. In non-equilibrium
conditions electrons cause current fluctuation (excess noise) that contains
fingerprint-like information about the electron kinetics. A crucial challenge
is hence a local detection of excess noise and its real-space mapping. However,
the challenge has not been tackled in existing noise measurements because the
noise studied was the spatially integrated one. Here we report the experiment
in which the excess noise at ultra-high-frequency(21.3THz), generated on
GaAs/AlGaAs quantum well (QW) devices with a nano-scale constriction, is
locally detected and mapped for the first time. We use a sharp tungsten tip as
a movable, contact-free and noninvasive probe of the local noise, and achieved
nano-scale spatial resolution (~50nm). Local profile of electron heating and
hot-electron kinetics at nano-scales are thereby visualized for the first time,
disclosing remarkable non-local nature of the transport, stemming from the
velocity overshoot and the intervalley hot electron transfer. While we
demonstrate the usefulness of our experimental method by applying to mesoscopic
conductors, we emphasize that the method is applicable to a variety of
different materials beyond the conductor, and term our instrument a scanning
noise microscope (SNoiM):In general non-equilibrium current fluctuations are
generated in any materials including dielectrics, metals and molecular systems.
The fluctuations, in turn, excite fluctuating electric and magnetic evanescent
fields on the material surface, which can be detected and imaged by our SNoiM.

effects. For many patients, we can predict non-existence of disease with 100%
certainty, just using demographics, lifestyle, and medical history information.
Our objective is to devise a general methodology for customizing tests using
user preferences so that expensive or uncomfortable tests can be avoided. We
propose to use classifiers trained from electronic health records (EHR) for
selection of tests. The key idea is to design classifiers with 100% false
normal rates, possibly at the cost higher false abnormals. We compare Naive
Bayes classification (NB), Random Forests (RF), Support Vector Machines (SVM)
and Logistic Regression (LR), and find kernel Logistic regression to be most
suitable for the task. We propose an algorithm for finding the best probability
threshold for kernel LR, based on test set accuracy. Using the proposed
algorithm, we describe schemes for selecting tests, which appear as features in
the automatic classification algorithm, using preferences on costs and
discomfort of the users. We test our methodology with EHRs collected for more
than 3000 patients, as a part of project carried out by a reputed hospital in
Mumbai, India. Kernel SVM and kernel LR with a polynomial kernel of degree 3,
yields an accuracy of 99.8% and sensitivity 100%, without the MP features, i.e.
using only clinical tests. We demonstrate our test selection algorithm using
two case studies, one using cost of clinical tests, and other using
""discomfort"" values for clinical tests. We compute the test sets corresponding
to the lowest false abnormals for each criterion described above, using
exhaustive enumeration of 15 clinical tests. The sets turn out to different,
substantiating our claim that one can customize test sets based on user
preferences.

the adsorption of oxygen dimers at the edges, which reduces the excitonic

  Detection/Correction through Adaptive Redundant Multithreading","Submitted to Journal",,,,"cs.DC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In the presence of accelerated fault rates, which are projected to be the
norm on future exascale systems, it will become increasingly difficult for
high-performance computing (HPC) applications to accomplish useful computation.
Due to the fault-oblivious nature of current HPC programming paradigms and
execution environments, HPC applications are insufficiently equipped to deal
with errors. We believe that HPC applications should be enabled with
capabilities to actively search for and correct errors in their computations.
The redundant multithreading (RMT) approach offers lightweight replicated
execution streams of program instructions within the context of a single
application process. However, the use of complete redundancy incurs significant
overhead to the application performance.
  In this paper we present RedThreads, an interface that provides
application-level fault detection and correction based on RMT, but applies the
thread-level redundancy adaptively. We describe the RedThreads syntax and
semantics, and the supporting compiler infrastructure and runtime system. Our
approach enables application programmers to scope the extent of redundant
computation. Additionally, the runtime system permits the use of RMT to be
dynamically enabled, or disabled, based on the resiliency needs of the
application and the state of the system. Our experimental results demonstrate
how adaptive RMT exploits programmer insight and runtime inference to
dynamically navigate the trade-off space between an application's resilience
coverage and the associated performance overhead of redundant computation.

robots. Learning-based exploration methods, including convolutional neural
networks, provide excellent strategies without human-designed logic for the
feature extraction. But the conventional supervised learning algorithms cost
lots of efforts on the labeling work of datasets inevitably. Scenes not
included in the training set are mostly unrecognized either. We propose a deep
reinforcement learning method for the exploration of mobile robots in an indoor
environment with the depth information from an RGB-D sensor only. Based on the
Deep Q-Network framework, the raw depth image is taken as the only input to
estimate the Q values corresponding to all moving commands. The training of the
network weights is end-to-end. In arbitrarily constructed simulation
environments, we show that the robot can be quickly adapted to unfamiliar
scenes without any man-made labeling. Besides, through analysis of receptive
fields of feature representations, deep reinforcement learning motivates the
convolutional networks to estimate the traversability of the scenes. The test
results are compared with the exploration strategies separately based on deep
learning or reinforcement learning. Even trained only in the simulated
environment, experimental results in real-world environment demonstrate that
the cognitive ability of robot controller is dramatically improved compared

contributions to the theory of the atomic nucleus and the elementary particles,
particularly through the discovery and application of fundamental symmetry
principles. There are no disputes about this statement. On the other hand,
there still is a question of why the statement did not mention Wigner's 1939
paper on the Lorentz group, which was regarded by Wigner and many others as his
most important contribution in physics. By many physicists, this paper was
regarded as a mathematical exposition having nothing to do with physics.
However, it has been more than one half century since 1963, and it is of
interest to see what progress has been made toward understanding physical
implications of this paper and its historical role in physics. Wigner in his
1963 paper defined the subgroups of the Lorentz group whose transformations do
not change the four-momentum of a given particle, and he called them the little
groups. Thus, Wigner's little groups are for internal space-time symmetries of
particles in the Lorentz-covariant world. Indeed, this subgroup can explain the
electron spin and spins of other massive particles. However, for massless
particles, there was a gap between his little group and electromagnetic waves
derivable Maxwell's equations. This gap was not completely removed until 1990.
The purpose of this report is to review the stormy historical process in which
this gap is cleared. It is concluded that Wigner's little groups indeed can be
combined into one Lorentz-covariant formula which can dictate the symmetry of
the internal space-time time symmetries of massive and massless particles in
the Lorentz covariant world, just like Einstein's energy-momentum relation
applicable to both slow and massless particles.

then compared with predictions from theoretical stellar isochrones with varying
initial He abundances, to determine $\Delta{Y}$. The availability of UV/optical
magnitudes thanks to the {\sl HST UV Legacy Survey of Galactic GCs} project,

efficiently disentangle the various sub-populations, and main sequence colour

square (CLMS), constrained affine projection (CAP) and constrained recursive

existing constrained adaptive filtering algorithms are developed under mean
square error (MSE) criterion, which is an ideal optimality criterion under
Gaussian noises. This assumption however fails to model the behavior of
non-Gaussian noises found in practice. Motivated by the robustness and
simplicity of maximum correntropy criterion (MCC) in non-Gaussian impulsive
noises, this paper proposes a new adaptive filtering algorithm called
constrained maximum correntropy criterion (CMCC). Specifically, CMCC
incorporates a linear constraint into a MCC filter to solve a constrained
optimization problem explicitly. The proposed adaptive filtering algorithm is
easy to implement and has low computational complexity, and in terms of
convergence accuracy (say lower mean square deviation) and stability, can
significantly outperform those MSE based constrained adaptive algorithms in
presence of heavy-tailed impulsive noises. Additionally, the mean square
convergence behaviors are studied under energy conservation relation, and a
sufficient condition to ensure the mean square convergence and the steady-state
mean square deviation (MSD) of the proposed algorithm are obtained. Simulation
results confirm the theoretical predictions under both Gaussian and non-
Gaussian noises, and demonstrate the excellent performance of the novel
algorithm by comparing it with other conventional methods.

citizens for public projects. A popular mechanism deployed on civic
crowdfunding platforms is a provision point mechanism, wherein, the total
contributions must reach a predetermined threshold in order for the project to
be provisioned (undertaken). Such a mechanism may have multiple equilibria;
unfortunately, in many of these equilibria, the project is not funded even if
it is highly valued among the agents. Recent work has proposed mechanisms with
refund bonuses where the project gets funded in equilibrium if its net value is
higher than a threshold among the agents who are aware of the crowdfunding
effort. In this paper, we formalize the notion of social desirability of a
public project and propose mechanisms which use the idea of referrals to expand
the pool of participants and achieve an equilibrium in which the project gets
funded if its net value exceeds a threshold among the entire agent population.
We call this new class of mechanisms Referral-Embedded Provision Point
Mechanisms (REPPM). We specifically propose two variants of REPPM and both
these mechanisms have the remarkable property that, at equilibrium, referral
bonuses are offered but there is no need for actual payment of these bonuses.
We establish that any given agent's equilibrium strategy is to refer other

with device areas ranging from 0.09cm2 to 0.5cm2 incorporating a thick aluminum
doped zinc oxide (AZO) electron selective contact with hysteresis-free PCE of
over 13% and high fill factor values in the range of 80%. AZO provides suitable
energy levels for carrier selectivity, neutralizes the presence of pinholes and
provides intimate interfaces. Devices using AZO exhibit an average PCE increase
of over 20% compared with the devices without AZO and maintain the high PCE for
the larger area devices reported. Furthermore, the device stability of p-i-n
perovskite solar cells under the ISOS-D-1 is enhanced when AZO is used, and
maintains 100% of the initial PCE for over 1000 hours of exposure when AZO/Au

kappa distributed plasma are analyzed as a Maxwellian. One common method to
calculate the space plasma parameters is by fitting the observed distributions
using known analytical forms. More often, the distribution function is included
in a forward model of the instrument's response, which is used to reproduce the
observed energy spectrograms for a given set of plasma parameters. In both
cases, the modeled plasma distribution fits the measurements to estimate the
plasma parameters. The distribution function is often considered to be
Maxwellian even though in many cases the plasma is better described by a kappa
distribution. In this work we show that if the plasma is described by a kappa
distribution, the derived temperature assuming Maxwell distribution can be
significantly off. More specifically, we derive the plasma temperature by
fitting a Maxwell distribution to pseudo-data produced by a kappa distribution,
and then examine the difference of the derived temperature as a function of the
kappa index. We further consider the concept of using a forward model of a
typical plasma instrument to fit its observations. We find that the relative
error of the derived temperature is highly depended on the kappa index and
occasionally on the instrument's field of view and response.

signal-to-noise ratios (S/N) of detected molecular lines and (2) that makes
visible otherwise undetectable weak lines. Our technique takes advantage of the
Keplerian rotational velocity pattern. It aligns spectra according to their
different centroid velocities at their different positions in a disk and stacks
them. After aligning, the signals are accumulated in a narrower velocity range
as compared to the original line width without alignment. Moreover, originally
correlated noise becomes de-correlated. Stacked and aligned spectra, thus, have
a higher S/N. We apply our method to ALMA archival data of DCN (3-2), DCO+
(3-2), N2D+ (3-2), and H2CO (3_0,3-2_0,2), (3_2,2-2_2,1), and (3_2,1-2_2,0) in
the protoplanetary disk around HD 163296. As a result, (1) the S/N of the
originally detected DCN (3-2), DCO+ (3-2), and H2CO (3_0,3-2_0,2) and N2D+
(3-2) lines are boosted by a factor of >4-5 at their spectral peaks, implying
one order of magnitude shorter integration times to reach the original S/N; and
(2) the previously undetectable spectra of the H2CO (3_2,2-2_2,1) and
(3_2,1-2_2,0) lines are materialized at more than 3 sigma. These dramatically
enhanced S/N allow us to measure intensity distributions in all lines with high
significance. The principle of our method can not only be applied to Keplerian
disks but also to any systems with ordered kinematic patterns.

X-ray excess with an effective temperature of ~86 eV. Rapid variability locates
the X-ray emission to within <73 Rg of the nuclear black hole. Radio emission
of flux density ~1 mJy, peaking at 1.5 GHz was detected 21 months after
discovery. Optical spectra indicate that the galaxy, at a distance of 73 Mpc

tidal disruption event to be the most likely cause of the flare. If this proves
to be correct then this is a very clean example of a disruption exhibiting both
thermal and non-thermal radiation.

carried out state-of-the-art hydrodynamical simulations of the circumplanetary
disks for both formation scenarios, using as similar initial conditions as
possible to unveil possible intrinsic differences in the circumplanetary disk
mass and temperature between the two formation mechanisms. We found that the
circumplanetary disks mass linearly scales with the circumstellar disk mass.
Therefore, in an equally massive protoplanetary disk, the circumplanetary disks
formed in the disk instability model can be only a factor of eight more massive
than their core-accretion counterparts. On the other hand, the bulk
circumplanetary disk temperature differs by more than an order of magnitude
between the two cases. The subdisks around planets formed by gravitational
instability have a characteristic temperature below 100 K, while the core
accretion circumplanetary disks are hot, with temperatures even greater than
1000 K when embedded in massive, optically thick protoplanetary disks. We
explain how this difference can be understood as the natural result of the
different formation mechanisms. We argue that the different temperatures should
persist up to the point when a full-fledged gas giant forms via disk
instability, hence our result provides a convenient criteria for observations
to distinguish between the two main formation scenarios by measuring the bulk
temperature in the planet vicinity.

in the local symmetry. In both systems the Cu p and d contributions at the
Fermi level are very similar. Based on the knowledge of orbital effects we
identify that the main cause of the locally induced spin-orbit couplings are Cu
p and d orbitals. By employing the DFT+U formalism as an analysis tool we find
that both the p and d orbital contributions are equally important to spin-orbit
coupling, although p contributions to the density of states are much higher. We
fit the DFT data with phenomenological tight-binding models developed

the low-energy electronic band structure in the whole Brillouin zone and allow
us to extract the size of the spin-orbit interaction induced by the local Cu
adatom to be in the tens of meV. By application of the phenomenological models

describing these complex phenomena commonly observed in landslides, avalanches,
debris flows and bedload transport. The model is based on the jump in the
momentum flux including changes of material and flow properties along the
flow-bed interface and enhances an existing general two-phase mass flow model
(Pudasaini, 2012). A two-phase variably saturated erodible basal morphology is
introduced and allows for the evolution of erosion-deposition-depths,
incorporating the inherent physical process including momentum and rheological
changes of the flowing mixture. By rigorous derivation, we show that
appropriate incorporation of the mass and momentum productions or losses in
conservative model formulation is essential for the physically correct and
mathematically consistent description of erosion-entrainment-deposition
processes. We show that mechanically deposition is the reversed process of
erosion. We derive mechanically consistent closures for coefficients emerging
in the erosion rate models. We prove that effectively reduced friction in
erosion is equivalent to the momentum production. With this, we solve the long
standing dilemma of mass mobility, and show that erosion enhances the mass flow
mobility. The novel enhanced real two-phase model reveals some major aspects of
the mechanics associated with erosion, entrainment and deposition. The model
appropriately captures the emergence and propagation of complex frontal surge

patterns in modern society, e.g., Internet, Internet of Things, Cloud Computing
and Tri-network Convergence, has caused the advent of the era of big data. Big
data contains huge values, however, mining knowledge from big data is a
tremendously challenging task because of data uncertainty and inconsistency.
Attribute reduction (also known as feature selection) can not only be used as
an effective preprocessing step, but also exploits the data redundancy to
reduce the uncertainty. However, existing solutions are designed 1) either for
a single machine that means the entire data must fit in the main memory and the
parallelism is limited; 2) or for the Hadoop platform which means that the data
have to be loaded into the distributed memory frequently and therefore become
inefficient. In this paper, we overcome these shortcomings for maximum
efficiency possible, and propose a unified framework for Parallel Large-scale
Attribute Reduction, termed PLAR, for big data analysis. PLAR consists of three
components: 1) Granular Computing (GrC)-based initialization: it converts a
decision table (i.e., original data representation) into a granularity
representation which reduces the amount of space and hence can be easily cached
in the distributed memory: 2) model-parallelism: it simultaneously evaluates
all feature candidates and makes attribute reduction highly parallelizable; 3)
data-parallelism: it computes the significance of an attribute in parallel
using a MapReduce-style manner. We implement PLAR with four representative
heuristic feature selection algorithms on Spark, and evaluate them on various
huge datasets, including UCI and astronomical datasets, finding our method's

arbitrary amounts of noise of this form. These results demonstrate the
challenges faced by experiments designed to demonstrate quantum supremacy over
classical computation, and how these challenges can be overcome.

  ultra-stiff tips",,,,,"cond-mat.mtrl-sci cond-mat.mes-hall physics.ins-det","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Piezoresponse Force Microscopy is a powerful but delicate nanoscale technique
that measures the mechanical response resulting from the application of a
highly localized electric field. Though mechanical response is normally due to
piezoelectricity, other physical phenomena, especially electrostatic
interaction, can contribute to the signal read. We address this problematic
through the use of longer ultra-stiff probes providing state of the art
sensitivity, with the lowest electrostatic interaction and avoiding working in
high frequency regime. In order to find this solution we develop a theoretical
description addressing the effects of electrostatic contributions in the total
cantilever vibration and its quantification for different setups. The theory is
subsequently tested in a Periodically Poled Lithium Niobate (PPLN) crystal, a
sample with well-defined 0deg and 180deg domains, using different commercial
available conductive tips. We employ the theoretical description to compare the
electrostatic contribution effects into the total phase recorded. Through
experimental data our description is corroborated for each of the tested
commercially available probes. We propose that a larger probe length can be a
solution to avoid electrostatic forces, so the cantilever-sample electrostatic
interaction is reduced. For hard oxide samples we propose an ultra-stiff
cantilever which avoids the use of high frequency voltage but still diminishing
electrostatic forces. Our proposed commercially available solution have great
implications into avoiding artifacts while studying soft biological samples,
multiferroic oxides, and thin film ferroelectric materials and it opens a new
window into tip engineering.

below $80$ K. The EFG fluctuations are enhanced with decreasing temperature due
to the fluctuations of a charge density wave that sets in at $T_{\rm CDW}=20$

which quantifies the amount of information shared between their reduced density
matrices (RDMs). Using analytical arguments combined with
density-matrix-renormalization-group (DMRG) and exact diagonalization (ED)
calculations, we show that for gapless systems the entanglement distance has
power law dependence on the energy separation and subsystem size with
$\alpha_E$ and $\alpha_{\ell}$ exponents, respectively. Using conformal field
theory (CFT) we find $\alpha_E = 2$ and $\alpha_{\ell} = 4$ for Abelian
theories with $c=1$ such as free fermions. For non-Abelian CFTs $\alpha_E = 0$
, and $\alpha_{\ell}$ is twice the conformal dimension of the thermal primary
fields. For instance for $Z_3$ parafermion CFT $\alpha_E = 1$ and
$\alpha_{\ell} = 4/5$. For gapped 1+1D fermion systems, we show that the
entanglement distance divides the low energy excitations into two branches with
different values of $\alpha_E$ and $\alpha_{\ell}$. These two branches are
related to momentum transfers near zero and $\pi$. We also demonstrate that the
entanglement distance reaches its maximum for degenerate states related through
nonlocal operators such as Wilson loops. For example, degenerate ground-states
(GSs) of 2+1 D topological states have maximum entanglement distance. On the
contrary, degenerate GSs related through confined anyon excitations such as
genons have minimum entanglement distance. Various implications of this concept
for quantum simulations are discussed. Finally, based on the ideas developed we
discuss the computational complexity of DMRG algorithms that are capable of
finding all degenerate GSs.

about the microscopic processes that govern a vast array of light-matter
interaction physics and applications. These include research areas right at the
forefront of extreme laser-plasma science such as laser-driven ion

demonstrate attosecond control over the trajectories of relativistic electron
bunches formed during such interactions by studying the emission of extreme
ultraviolet (XUV) harmonic radiation. We describe how the precise addition of a
second laser beam operating at the second harmonic of the driving laser pulse
can significantly transform the interaction by modifying the accelerating
potential provided by the fundamental frequency to drive strong coherent
emission. Numerical particle-in-cell code simulations and experimental
observations demonstrate that this modification is extremely sensitive to the
relative phase of the two beams and can lead to significant enhancements in the
resulting harmonic yield. This work also reveals that the ability to control
these extreme interactions with attosecond precision is an essential
requirement for generation of ultra-bright, high temporal contrast attosecond
radiation for atomic and molecular pump-probe experiments5,6.

(chirp) to manipulate and control the magnetization dynamics in a nanomagnet.
By recasting the Landau-Lifshitz-Slonczewski equation in a quantum-like
two-level formalism, we show that a chirped spin current polarized in the
direction normal to the anisotropy axis can induce a stable precession of the
magnetic moment at any angle (up to $90^\circ$) with respect to the anisotropy
axis. The drive current can be modest ($10^6\,\rm A/cm^2$ or lower) provided
the chirp rate is sufficiently slow. The induced precession is stable against
thermal noise, even for small nano-objects at room temperature. Complete
reversal of the magnetization can be achieved by adding a small external
magnetic field antiparallel to the easy axis. Alternatively, a combination of
chirped ac and dc currents with different polarization directions can also be
used to trigger the reversal.

(VSR). It is assumed that there is a small violation of Lorentz invariance and
the true symmetry group of nature is a subgroup called SIM(2). This symmetry
group postulates the existence of a fundamental or preferred direction in
space-time. We study its implications by using an effective action which
violates Lorentz invariance but respects VSR. We find that the problem of
finding the masses of fundamental fermions is in general intractable in the
presence of VSR term. The problem can be solved only in special cases which we
pursue in this paper. We next determine the signal of VSR in torsion pendulum
experiment as well as clock comparison experiment. We find that VSR predicts a
signal which is different from other Lorentz violating theories and hence a
dedicated data analysis is needed in order to impose reliable limits. Assuming
that signal is absent in data we determine the limits that can be imposed on
the VSR parameters. We also study the implications of VSR in particle decay
experiments taking the charged pion and kaon decay as an example. The effective
interaction between the charged pion and the final state leptons is related to
the fundamental VSR mass terms through a loop calculation. We also predict a
shift in the angular dependence of the decay products due to VSR. In particular
we find that these no longer display azimuthal symmetry with respect to the
momentum of the pion. Furthermore the azimuthal and polar angle distributions
show time dependence with a period of a sidereal day. This time dependence
provides us with a novel method to test VSR in future experiments.

Considering the fact that video exemplification is a thriving practice in the
field although there is little consensus in the literature regarding its
instructional issues, it seems appropriate to focus on the activity carried out
by teachers in video-enhanced devices in order to identify promising
characteristics (nature of the examples, types of associations between them,
documentation methods, organization and scenarization, etc.). This study
involved six trainees who used, during two sessions of 45 minutes, a digital
device based on a "" pedagogy of typical professional paths "" (Durand, 2014; Ria
\& Leblanc, 2011). The goal was to better understand their use of video
exemplification and sense-making. The results indicate that student teachers
(i) preferentially target resources about ""economic rules""; (ii) plebiscite
classroom situations, always consulted; (iii) are particularly interested (even
if they are sometimes disappointed) in the experts' testimonies; (iv) initially
show a distrust toward resources assumed to be theoretical; (v) get gradually
interested in these resources during the second session. We conclude with
several empirical and technological prospects for the design of video-enhanced
devices for teacher induction.

we define and study a generalization of the Tutte polynomial for directed
graphs, that we name B-polynomial. The B-polynomial has three variables, but
when specialized to the case of graphs (that is, digraphs where arcs come in
pairs with opposite directions), one of the variables becomes redundant and the
B-polynomial is equivalent to the Tutte polynomial. We explore various
properties, expansions, specializations, and generalizations of the
B-polynomial, and try to answer the following questions: 1. what properties of
the digraph can be detected from its B-polynomial (acyclicity, length of paths,
number of strongly connected components, etc.)? 2. which of the marvelous
properties of the Tutte polynomial carry over to the directed graph setting?
The B-polynomial generalizes the strict chromatic polynomial of mixed graphs
introduced by Beck, Bogart and Pham. We also consider a quasisymmetric function
version of the B-polynomial which simultaneously generalizes the Tutte
symmetric function of Stanley and the quasisymmetric chromatic function of
Shareshian and Wachs.

experiments, in particular DEAP-3600 and XENON1T. In our chosen nuclear dark
matter scenario distinctive features arise in the recoil energy spectra due to
the non-point-like nature of the composite dark matter state. We calculate the
number of events required to distinguish these spectra from those of a standard
point-like WIMP state with a decaying exponential recoil spectrum. In the most
favourable regions of nuclear dark matter parameter space, we find that a few
tens of events are needed to distinguish nuclear dark matter from WIMPs at the
$3\,\sigma$ level in a single experiment. Given the total exposure time of
DEAP-3600 and XENON1T we find that at best a $2\,\sigma$ distinction is
possible by these experiments individually, while $3\,\sigma$ sensitivity is
reached for a range of parameters by the combination of the two experiments. We
show that future upgrades of these experiments have potential to distinguish a
large range of nuclear dark matter models from that of a WIMP at greater than
$3\,\sigma$.

vector boson recoils against (multiple) parton emission(s), and is determined
by QCD dynamics. At small transverse momentum, the fixed order predictions
break down due to the emergence of large logarithmic contributions. This region
can be studied via the $p_T^Z$ distribution constructed from the energies of
the leptons, or through the $\phi^*$ distribution that relies on the directions
of the leptons. For sufficiently small transverse momentum, the $\phi^*$
observable can be measured experimentally with better resolution. We study the
small $p_T^Z$ and $\phi^*$ distributions up to next-to-next-to-leading order
(NNLO) in perturbative QCD. We compute the $\phi^*$ distributions for the fully
inclusive production of lepton pairs via $Z/\gamma^*$ to NNLO and normalise
them to the NNLO cross sections for inclusive $Z/\gamma^*$ production. We
compare our predictions with the $\phi^*$ distribution measured by the ATLAS
collaboration during LHC operation at 8 TeV. We find that at moderate to large
values of $\phi^*$, the NNLO effects are positive and lead to a substantial
improvement in the theory-data comparison compared to next-to-leading order
(NLO). At small values of $p_T^Z$ and $\phi^*$, the known large logarithmic
enhancements emerge through and we identify the region where resummation is
needed. We find an approximate relationship between the values of $p_T^Z$ and
$\phi^*$ where the large logarithms emerge and find perturbative consistency
between the two observables.

at 17 different wavelengths, from X-ray to radio bands, starting 81 seconds
after the burst and extending up to 74 days later. We performed for the first
time a GRB afterglow observation with the ALMA observatory. We find that the
afterglow of GRB 110715A is very bright at optical and radio wavelengths. We
use optical and near infrared spectroscopy to provide further information about
the progenitor's environment and its host galaxy. The spectrum shows weak
absorption features at a redshift z = 0.8225, which reveal a host galaxy
environment with low ionization, column density and dynamical activity. Late
deep imaging shows a very faint galaxy, consistent with the spectroscopic
results. The broadband afterglow emission is modelled with synchrotron
radiation using a numerical algorithm and we determine the best fit parameters
using Bayesian inference in order to constrain the physical parameters of the
jet and the medium in which the relativistic shock propagates. We fitted our
data with a variety of models, including different density profiles and energy
injections. Although the general behaviour can be roughly described by these
models, none of them are able to fully explain all data points simultaneously.
GRB 110715A shows the complexity of reproducing extensive multi-wavelength
broadband afterglow observations, and the need of good sampling in wavelength
and time and more complex models to accurately constrain the physics of GRB
afterglows.

set extrapolated plane wave results agree very well with the Gaussian basis

agreement, we correct for finite basis set errors as well as errors introduced
by periodically repeated images. For electron affinities below the vacuum level
differences between Gaussian basis sets and VASP are slightly larger. We
attribute this to larger basis set extrapolation errors for the Gaussian basis

This is tentatively explained by insufficient basis set convergence of the

introduced an abundance of strategic games to study natural phenomena in
networks. Unfortunately, almost all of these games have the conceptual drawback
of being computationally intractable, i.e. computing a best response strategy
or checking if an equilibrium is reached is NP-hard. Thus, a main challenge in
the field is to find tractable realistic network formation models.
  We address this challenge by investigating a very recently introduced model
by Goyal et al. [WINE'16] which focuses on robust networks in the presence of a
strong adversary who attacks (and kills) nodes in the network and lets this
attack spread virus-like to neighboring nodes and their neighbors. Our main
result is to establish that this natural model is one of the few exceptions
which are both realistic and computationally tractable. In particular, we
answer an open question of Goyal et al. by providing an efficient algorithm for
computing a best response strategy, which implies that deciding whether the
game has reached a Nash equilibrium can be done efficiently as well. Our
algorithm essentially solves the problem of computing a minimal connection to a
network which maximizes the reachability while hedging against severe attacks
on the network infrastructure and may thus be of independent interest.

the properties namely, frequency dependent skin depth, capacitive transport,

ionizing radiation is known and well studied. Radiation hardness by design
techniques have been developed to mitigate this effect and have been
successfully used. More recent developments in smaller feature size
technologies do not make use of these techniques due to their drawbacks in
terms of logic density and requirement of dedicated libraries. During operation
the resulting increase of the supply current is a serious challenge and needs
to be considered during the system design.
  A simple parametrization of the leakage current of NMOS transistors as a
function of total ionizing dose is presented. The parametrization uses a
transistor transfer characteristics of the parasitic transistor along the
shallow trench isolation to describe the leakage current of the nominal
transistor. Together with a parametrization of the number of positive charges
trapped in the silicon dioxide and number of activated interface traps in the
silicon to silicon dioxide interface the leakage current as a function of the
exposure time to ionizing radiation results. This function is fitted to data of
the leakage current of single transistors as well as to data of the supply
current of full ASICs.

fast growing of new terms addition, a wide range of name variation for the same

sources and external knowledge, as well as multiple token representations for a
single drug name that is more common in the real application setting. Although
many approaches have been proposed to overwhelm the task, some problems
remained with poor F-score performance (less than 0.75). This paper presents a
new treatment in data representation techniques to overcome some of those

characteristics of word distribution and word similarities as a result of word
embedding training. The first technique is evaluated with the standard NN

notion of a network hub that facilitates seizure activity. We performed a

networks derived from long-term, multi-channel, intracranial
electroencephalographic recordings from an epilepsy patient. Our preliminary
findings indicate that the epileptic focus is not consistently the most
important network node, but node importance may drastically vary over time.

in recent years by several authors. Roughly speaking, we first choose a
consensus set of elections (defined via preferences of voters over candidates)
for which the result is specified a priori (intuitively, these are elections on
which all voters can easily agree on the result). We also choose a measure of
distance between elections. The result of an election outside the consensus set
is defined to be the result of the closest consensual election under the
distance measure.
  Most previous work has dealt with a definition in terms of preference
profiles. However, most voting rules in common use are anonymous and
homogeneous. In this case there is a much more succinct representation (using
the voting simplex) of the inputs to the rule. This representation has been
widely used in the voting literature, but rarely in the context of distance
rationalizability.
  We show exactly how to connect distance rationalizability on profiles for
anonymous and homogeneous rules to geometry in the simplex. We develop the
connection for the important special case of votewise distances, recently
introduced and studied by Elkind, Faliszewski and Slinko in several papers.
This yields a direct interpretation in terms of well-developed mathematical
concepts not seen before in the voting literature, namely Kantorovich (also
called Wasserstein) distances and the geometry of Minkowski spaces.
  As an application of this approach, we prove some positive and some negative
results about the decisiveness of distance rationalizable anonymous and
homogeneous rules. The positive results connect with the recent theory of
hyperplane rules, while the negative ones deal with distances that are not
metrics, controversial notions of consensus, and the fact that the
$\ell^1$-norm is not strictly convex.

  For rules satisfying various axiomatic properties such as anonymity,
neutrality and homogeneity, the standard profile representation of input can be
compressed substantially. We explain in detail using quotient constructions and
symmetry groups how distance rationalizability is interpreted in this
situation. This enables us to connect the theory of distance rationalizability
with geometric concepts such as Earth Mover distance and optimal
transportation. We expect this connection to prove fruitful in future work.
  We improve on the best-known sufficient conditions for rules rationalized via
votewise distances to satisfy anonymity, neutrality, homogeneity, consistency

closer scrutiny in future.

that was recently introduced by Blath et al. Individuals live in colonies and
change type via resampling and mutation. Each colony contains a seed-bank that
acts as a genetic reservoir. Individuals can enter the seed-bank and become
dormant or can exit the seed-bank and become active. In each colony at each
generation a fixed fraction of individuals swap state, drawn randomly from the
active and the dormant population. While dormant, individuals suspend their
resampling. While active, individuals resample from their own colony, but also
from different colonies according to a random walk transition kernel
representingmigration. Both active and dormant individuals mutate.
  We derive a formula for the probability that two individuals drawn randomly
from two given colonies are identical by descent, i.e., share a common
ancestor. This formula, which is formulated in Fourier language, is valid when
the colonies form a discrete torus. We consider the special case of a symmetric
slow seed-bank, for which in each colony half of the individuals are in the
seed-bank and at each generation the fraction of individuals that swap state is
small. This leads to a simpler formula, from which we are able to deduce how
the probability to be identical by descent depends on the distance between the
two colonies and various relevant parameters. Through an analysis of random
walk Green functions, we are able to derive explicit scaling expressions when
mutation is slower than migration. We also compute the spatial second moment of
the probability to be identical by descent for all parameters when the torus
becomes large. For the special case of a symmetric slow seed-bank, we again
obtain explicit scaling expressions.

variants (synchronous, Downpour, and elastic averaging) using ISP-ML,
exploiting the multiple NAND channels to parallelize SGD. In addition, we
compare the performance of ISP and that of conventional in-host processing,

which lead to an enhanced user experience. Current approaches for quantifying
the output accuracy of a localization system in real-time either do not provide
a distance metric, require an extensive training process, and/or are tailored
to a specific localization system. In this paper, we present the design,
implementation, and evaluation of CONE: a novel calibration-free accurate
confidence estimation system that can work in real-time with any location
determination system. CONE builds on a sound theoretical model that allows it
to trade the required user confidence with tight bound on the estimated
confidence radius. We also introduce a new metric for evaluating confidence
estimation systems that can capture new aspects of their performance.
Evaluation of CONE on Android phones in a typical testbed using the iBeacons
BLE technology with a side-by-side comparison with traditional confidence
estimation techniques shows that CONE can achieve a consistent median absolute
error difference accuracy of less than 2.7m while estimating the user position
more than 80% of the time within the confidence circle. This is significantly
better than the state-of-the-art confidence estimation systems that are
tailored to the specific localization system in use. Moreover, CONE does not
require any calibration and therefore provides a scalable and ubiquitous
confidence estimation system for pervasive applications.

distribution measured in heavy-ion collisions at top RHIC and LHC energies are
described using the two-component model approach based on a convolution of the
Monte Carlo Glauber model with the Weibull model for particle production. The
model successfully describes the multiplicity and transverse-energy
distribution of minimum-bias collision data for a wide range of energies. The
Weibull-Glauber model can be used to determine the centrality classes in
heavy-ion collisions as an alternative to the conventional negative binomial
distribution (NBD)-Glauber approach.

time. As our nation and the field of astronomy grow more diverse, we find
ourselves in a position of enormous potential and opportunity: a multitude of
studies show how groups of diverse individuals with differing viewpoints
outperform homogenous groups to find solutions that are more innovative,
creative, and responsive to complex problems, and promote higher-order thinking
amongst the group. Research specifically into publications also shows that
diverse author groups publish in higher quality journals and receive higher
citation rates. As we welcome more diverse individuals into astronomy, we
therefore find ourselves in a position of potential never before seen in the
history of science, with the best minds and most diverse perspectives our field
has ever seen. Despite this enormous growing potential, and the proven power of
diversity, the demographics of our field are not keeping pace with the changing
demographics of the nation, and astronomers of colour, women, LGBT individuals,
people with disabilities, and those with more than one of these identities
still face ""chilly"" or ""hostile"" work environments in the sciences. If we are
to fully support all astronomers and students in reaching their full scientific
potential, we must recognize that most of us tend to overestimate our ability
to support our minoritized students and colleagues, that our formal education
system fails to prepare us for working in a multicultural environment, and that
most of us need some kind of training to help us know what we don't know and
fill those gaps in our education. To that end, diversity and inclusion training
for AAS council and leadership, heads of astronomy departments, and faculty
search committees should be a basic requirement throughout our field.

$K=1,2,3$. The non-central DG methods are locally divergence-free, while the
central DG are ""exactly"" divergence-free but have to find two approximate
solutions defined on mutually dual meshes. The adaptive WENO limiter first
identifies the ""troubled"" cells by using a modified TVB minmod function, and
then uses the WENO technique to locally reconstruct a new polynomial of degree
$(2K+1)$ inside the ""troubled"" cells replacing the DG solution by based on the
cell average values of the DG solutions in the neighboring cells as well as the
original cell averages of the ""troubled"" cells. The WENO limiting procedure
does not destroy the locally or ""exactly"" divergence-free property of magnetic

computational cost can be as little as possible. Several test problems in one
and two dimensions are solved by using our non-central and central Runge-Kutta

null interior field perspective. Exact surface currents provided by that
solution, when considered as disembodied half-plane laminae radiating into an
ambient, uniform space both inside and outside the wedge proper, do succeed in
reconstituting both a specular, mirror field above the exposed face, and a
shielding plane-wave field of a sign opposite to that of the incoming
excitation which, under superposition, creates both the classical,
geometric-optics shadow, and a strictly null interior field at the dominant,
plane-wave level. Both mirror and shadow radiated fields are controlled by the
residue at just one simple pole encountered during a spectral radiative field
assembly, fixed in place by incidence direction $\phi_{0}$ as measured from the
exposed face. The radiated fields further provide diffractive contributions
drawn from two saddle points that track observation angle $\phi.$ Even these,
more or less asymptotic contributions, are found to cancel exactly within the
wedge interior, while, on the outside, they recover in its every detail the
canonical structure lying at the base of GTD (geometric theory of diffraction).
It is earnestly hoped that this revised scattering viewpoint, while leaving
intact all details of the existing solution, will impart to it a fresh,
physically robust meaning. Moreover, since this viewpoint confirms, admittedly
in an extreme limit, the concept of field self-consistency (Ewald-Oseen
extinction in more picturesque language), perhaps such explicit vindication may
yet encourage efforts to seek exact solutions to scattering/diffraction by
electromagnetically permeable (dielectric) wedges, efforts that harness
integral equations with polarization/ohmic currents distributed throughout
wedge volumes as sources radiating into an ambient, uniform reference medium.

Microwave Background) photons, freely propagating through the expanding cosmos,
varies proportional to 1/S^4 with S being the scale factor of the universe.
This behavior is expected, because General Theory of Relativity, in application
to FLRW- (Friedmann-Lemaitre-Robertson-Walker) cosmological universes, leads to
the conclusion that the photon wavelengths increase during their free passage
through the spacetime metrics of the universe by the same factor as does the
scale factor S. This appears to be a reasonable explanation for the presently
observed Planckian CMB spectrum with its actual temperature of about 2.7 K,
while at the time of its origin after the last scattering during the
recombination phase its temperature should have been about 3000 K, at an epoch
of about 380 ky after the Big Bang, when the scale of the universe S_r was
smaller by roughly a factor of S/S_r = 1+z_r = 1100 compared to the present
scale S = S_0 of the universe. In this paper we start from putting the question
whether the scale-behavior of the CMB energy density that enters the
energy-momentum tensor of the field equations describing the expanding universe
is really falling off like 1/S^4 and, if in fact a deviation from a behavior
according to 1/S^4 would occur, why do we nevertheless presently observe a CMB
energy density which appears to be in accordance with such a 1/S^4-scaling?
This question arises from another basic and fundamental question, namely: Can
we really assume that the wavelength of the freely propagating photon during
its travel all the way along its light geodetic is permanently affected by the
expansion of the universe, i.e continuously recognizes the expansion of the
cosmic scale S? With other words: Do freely propagating photons ........

was subjected to a short-period of food deprivation. After 2.5 days, the serum
was obtained and different parameters including the total protein, AST, ALT,
triglyceride, HDL, LDL, creatinine and urea were assessed. Gastrointestinal
tract, stomach and liver were excised and their masses were estimated. Paraffin

decreases in the masses of body, gastrointestinal tract, stomach and liver of
the starved group were recorded. The liver and duodenum were the most affected

times more than the minimum of the MTT. The result is similar to the results in
the recursive fractal scale-free trees and T-fractal, but it is quite different
