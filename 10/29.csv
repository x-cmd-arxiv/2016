account of the effects of Polyakov loop fluctuations in Weiss mean-field

(no fluctuation from the mean-field). The Polyakov loops strongly suppress the
chiral transition temperature in the second-order/crossover region at small
chemical potential, while they give a minor modification of the first-order
phase boundary at larger chemical potential. The Polyakov loops also account
for a drastic increase of the interaction measure near the chiral phase
transition. The chiral and Polyakov loop susceptibilities have their peaks
close to each other in the second-order/crossover region. In particular in
Weiss MFA, there is no indication of the separated deconfinement transition
boundary from the chiral phase boundary at any chemical potential. We discuss
the interplay between the chiral and deconfinement dynamics via the bare quark

long-periodic pulsations occurred in the preflare phase before the onset of

30 min and last for about 1 - 2 hours. They are possibly generated from LRC
oscillations of plasma loops where electric current dominates the physical

preflare-VLP provides an essential information for understanding the triggering

well as their decay constants, in the chiral limit, in the approximation where
the hypercolour $Sp(2N)$ dynamics is described by four-fermion operators, \`a

spin-zero electroweak-singlet states may be as light as the Goldstone-boson

available spectral sum rules. In order to supply composite top-quark partners,
the theory contains additional fermions carrying both hypercolour and ordinary

identify and analyse several non-trivial features of the complete two-sector

stabilises, the viscosity also keeps its maximum constant value, with drops and
recoveries, for a long period of time. This complex rheological behaviour,
which was observed to be shear strain dependent, is a consequence of two
coupled effects: the cell density continuous increase and its changing
interacting properties. Particular attention was given to the late phase of
growth of E. coli populations under shear. Rheo-imaging measurements revealed,
near the static plate, a rotational motion of E. coli aggregates, collectively
tumbling and flowing in the shear direction. To explain this behaviour, we
introduce a simple theoretical model, in which the individual cells are
transported by the flow, but remain rigidly attached to the other cells of the
aggregate.

cooperative communication network (WPCN) in which a pair of distributed
terminal users first harvest wireless energy broadcasted by one energy node

node (DN). In particular, the two cooperating users exchange their independent
information with each other so as to form a virtual antenna array and transmit
jointly to the DN. By allowing the users to share their harvested energy to
transmit each other's information, the proposed method can effectively mitigate
the inherent user unfairness problem in WPCN, where one user may suffer from
very low data rate due to poor energy harvesting performance and high data
transmission consumptions. Depending on the availability of channel state
information at the transmitters, we consider the two users cooperating using
either coherent or non-coherent data transmissions. In both cases, we derive
the maximum common throughput achieved by the cooperation schemes through
optimizing the time allocation on wireless energy transfer, user message
exchange, and joint information transmissions in a fixed-length time slot. We
also perform numerical analysis to study the impact of channel conditions on
the system performance. By comparing with some existing benchmark schemes, our
results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed user cooperation in a
WPCN under different application scenarios.

influenced by frictional interactions between constituent particles. However,
neither hydrodynamics nor friction has successfully explained the full range of
flow phenomena in concentrated suspensions. Particles with asperities represent
a case in point. Lubrication hydrodynamics fail to completely capture two key
rheological properties - namely, that the viscosity increases drastically and
the first normal stress difference can switch signs as volume fraction
increases. Yet, simulations that account for interparticle friction are also
unable to fully predict these properties. Furthermore, experiments show that
rheological behavior can vary depending on particle roughness and
deformability. We seek to resolve these apparent contradictions by
systematically tuning the roughness of model colloids, investigating their
viscosity and first normal stress differences under steady shear, and finally
generating a rheological state diagram that demonstrates how surface roughness
influences the transition between shear thickening and dilatancy. Our
simulations, which are in good agreement with the experiments, suggest that
friction between rough particles is significant. In addition, we find that
roughness progressively lowers the critical conditions required for the onset
of shear thickening and dilatancy. Our results thus provides a major
contribution in the field of suspension rheology with broad relevance to
granular and particulate materials. For instance, particle geometry can be
tuned to increase the efficacy of materials that turn solid-like on the
application of stimuli. On the other hand, engineers who work with concentrated
slurries can now use images of the constituent particles to estimate optimal
flow processing conditions.

direct means of comparing the predictions of theoretical models and simulations

observational constraints. The new ""galactic $V_{max}$"" function is steeper
than the line-of-sight velocity function but still shallower than the
theoretical CDM expectation, showing that some unaccounted physical process is
necessary to reduce the abundance of galaxies and/or drastically modify their
density profiles compared to CDM haloes. Using this new galactic $V_{max}$
function, we investigate the viability of baryonic solutions such as
feedback-powered outflows and photoevaporation of gas from an ionising
radiation background. At the 3-$\sigma$ confidence level neither energetic
feedback nor photoevaporation are effective enough to reconcile the
disagreement. In the case of maximum baryonic effects, the theoretical estimate
still deviates significantly from the observations for $V_{max} < 60$ km/s. CDM
predicts at least 1.8 times more galaxies with $V_{max} = 50$ km/s and 2.5
times more than observed at $30$ km/s. Recent hydrodynamic simulations seem to
resolve the discrepancy but disagree with the properties of observed galaxies

then in the remaining domain, the union of all the loops of $L$ that touch $l$
satisfies the conformal restriction property while the other loops in $L$ form
an independent loop-soup. This result holds when one discovers $l$ in a natural

conditioned on its entire outer boundary while we discover here only part of
this boundary. And, while it was explained there that the strong decomposition
using a Poisson point process of excursions that we derived there should be

the ambient fluid and the plume fluid) in determining the plume structure and
dynamics. In our experiments, we are able to capture geophysical convection
regimes relevant to mantle convection both for hot spots (when U > 1) and
plate-subduction (when U < 1) regimes. The planar laser induced fluorescence
(PLIF) technique is used for flow visualization and characterizing the plume
structures. The convection is driven by compositional buoyancy generated by the
perfusion of lighter fluid across a permeable mesh and the viscosity ratio U is
systematically varied over a range from 1/300 to 2500. The planform, near the
bottom boundary for U=1, exhibits a well-known dendritic line plume structure.
As the value of U is increased, a progressive morphological transition is
observed from the dendritic-plume structure to discrete spherical plumes,
accompanied with thickening of the plumes and an increase in the plume spacing.
In the vertical section, mushroom-shaped plume heads at U=1 change into
intermittent spherical-blob shaped plumes at high U, resembling mantle plume
hot spots in mantle convection. In contrast, for low values of U (~1/300), the
regime corresponds to subduction of plates in the mantle. In this regime, we
observe for the first time that plumes arise from a thick boundary with
cellular structure and develop into sheet-plumes. We use experimental data to
quantify these morphological changes and mixing dynamics of the plumes at
different regimes of U. We also compare our observations on plume spacing with
various models reported in the literature by varying the viscosity ratio and
the buoyancy flux.

Recently, it has been realized that spin dynamics can be driven very
effectively in micrometer-sized Y$_3$Fe$_5$O$_{12}$/Pt heterostructures by
spin-Hall effects. We demonstrate here the excitation and detection of spin
dynamics in Y$_3$Fe$_5$O$_{12}$/Pt nanowires by spin-torque ferromagnetic
resonance. The nanowires defined via electron-beam lithography are fabricated
by conventional room temperature sputtering deposition on Gd$_3$Ga$_5$O$_{12 }$
substrates and lift-off. We observe field-like and anti-damping-like torques
acting on the magnetization precession, which are due to simultaneous
excitation by Oersted fields and spin-Hall torques. The Y$_3$Fe$_5$O$_{12}$/Pt
nanowires are thoroughly examined over a wide frequency and power range. We
observe a large change in the resonance field at high microwave powers, which
is attributed to a decreasing effective magnetization due to microwave
absorption. These heating effects are much more pronounced in the investigated
nanostructures than in comparable micron-sized samples. By comparing different
nanowire widths, the importance of geometrical confinements for magnetization
dynamics becomes evident: quantized spin-wave modes across the width of the
wires are observed in the spectra. Our results are the first stepping stones
toward the realization of integrated magnonic logic devices based on
insulators, where nanomagnets play an essential role.

In order for a renormalization group (RG) improved effective $\lambda \phi^4$
potential to develop an inflection-point, the quartic coupling $\lambda(\phi)$
must exhibit a minimum with an almost vanishing value in its RG evolution,
namely $\lambda(\phi_I) \simeq 0$ and $\beta_{\lambda}(\phi_I) \simeq 0$, where
$\beta_{\lambda}$ is the beta-function of the quartic coupling. As an example,
we consider the minimal gauged $B-L$ extended Standard Model at the TeV scale,

inflection-point inflation, which is consistent with the current cosmological
observations, the mass ratios among the $Z^{\prime}$ gauge boson, the
right-handed neutrinos and the $B-L$ Higgs boson are fixed. Our scenario can be
tested in the future collider experiments such as the High-Luminosity LHC and

around the centre of the cluster than the other cluster stars, in particular
when compared to the dominant ""intermediate"" population (moderately Na-enhanced

this extreme population and that of the intermediate population is found to be
$\sim$4 km s$^{-1}$, with a 98.4% probability that the rotational amplitude of
the extreme population is larger than that of the intermediate population. We
argue that the observed difference in rotational amplitudes, obtained when
splitting subsamples according to their chemistry, is not a product of the
long-term dynamical evolution of the cluster, but more likely a surviving
feature imprinted early in the formation history of this GC and its multiple
populations. We also find an agreement (within uncertainties) in the inferred

[NGVS] to investigate the color-magnitude diagram for the galaxies inhabiting
the core of this cluster. The sensitivity of the NGVS imaging allows us to
continuously probe galaxy colors over a factor of $\sim 2 \times 10^5$ in
luminosity, from brightest cluster galaxies to scales overlapping classical
satellites of the Milky Way [$M_{g^{\prime}}$ $\sim$ $-$9; $M_{*}$ $\sim 10^6$
M$_{\odot}$], within a single environment. Remarkably, we find the first
evidence that the RS flattens in all colors at the faint-magnitude end
[starting between $-$14 $\le$ $M_{g^{\prime}}$ $\le$ $-$13, around $M_{*}$
$\sim 4 \times 10^7$ M$_{\odot}$], with the slope decreasing to $\sim$60% or
less of its value at brighter magnitudes. This could indicate that the stellar
populations of faint dwarfs in Virgo's core share similar characteristics [e.g.
constant mean age] over $\sim$3 mags in luminosity, suggesting that these
galaxies were quenched coevally, likely via pre-processing in smaller hosts. We
also compare our results to galaxy formation models, finding that the RS in
model clusters have slopes at intermediate magnitudes that are too shallow, and
in the case of semi-analytic models, do not reproduce the flattening seen at
both extremes [bright/faint] of the Virgo RS. Deficiencies in the chemical
evolution of model galaxies likely contribute to the model-data discrepancies
at all masses, while overly efficient quenching may also be a factor at dwarf
scales. Deep UV and near-IR photometry are required to unambiguously diagnose
the cause of the faint-end flattening.

field theories with large $N$ and a sparse spectrum. Theories in this class are
expected to have local holographic duals, so effective field theory in anti-de
Sitter suggests that the stress tensor sector should exhibit universal,
gravity-like behavior. At the linearized level, the hallmark of locality in the
emergent geometry is that stress tensor three-point functions $\langle
TTT\rangle$, normally specified by three constants, should approach a universal
structure controlled by a single parameter as the gap to higher spin operators
is increased. We demonstrate this phenomenon by a direct CFT calculation.
Stress tensor exchange, by itself, violates causality and unitarity unless the
three-point functions are carefully tuned, and the unique consistent choice
exactly matches the prediction of Einstein gravity. Under some assumptions
about the other potential contributions, we conclude that this structure is
universal, and in particular, that the anomaly coefficients satisfy $a\approx
c$ as conjectured by Camanho et al. The argument is based on causality of a
four-point function, with kinematics designed to probe bulk locality, and
invokes the chaos bound of Maldacena, Shenker, and Stanford.

in galaxies, in particular at the peak of star formation z=1-3. We attempt a
novel approach by letting long-duration Gamma Ray Bursts (LGRBs) x-ray their
host galaxies and deliver column densities to us. This requires a good
understanding of the obscurer and biases introduced by incomplete follow-up
observations. We analyse the X-ray afterglow of all 844 Swift LGRBs to date for
their column density $N_H$. To derive the population properties we propagate
all uncertainties in a consistent Bayesian methodology. The $N_H$ distribution
covers the $10^{20-23}\mathrm{cm}^{-2}$ range and shows no evolutionary effect.
Higher obscurations, e.g. Compton-thick columns, could have been detected but
are not observed. The $N_H$ distribution is consistent with sources randomly
populating a ellipsoidal gas cloud of major axis
$N_H^\text{major}=10^{23}\mathrm{cm}^{-2}$ with 0.22 dex intrinsic scatter
between objects. The unbiased SHOALS survey of afterglows and hosts allows us
to constrain the relation between Spitzer-derived stellar masses and X-ray
derived column densities $N_H$. We find a well-constrained powerlaw relation of
$N_H=10^{21.7}\mathrm{cm}^{-2}\times\left(M_{\star}/10^{9.5}M_{\odot}\right)^{1/3}$,
with 0.5 dex intrinsic scatter between objects. The Milky Way and the
Magellanic clouds also follow this relation. From the geometry of the obscurer,
its stellar mass dependence and comparison with local galaxies we conclude that
LGRBs are primarily obscured by galaxy-scale gas. Ray tracing of simulated
Illustris galaxies reveals a relation of the same normalisation, but a steeper
stellar-mass dependence and mild redshift evolution. Our new approach provides
valuable insight into the gas residing in high-redshift galaxies.

provide model boundary constraints, for both Compton-thin and Compton-thick
levels of obscuration, as obscured fractions are mean covering factors
$f_{\text{cov}}$. However, a major remaining uncertainty is host galaxy
obscuration. In Paper I we discovered a relation of $N_H \propto
M_{\star}^{1/3}$ for the obscuration of galaxy-scale gas. Here we apply this
observational relation to the AGN population, and find that galaxy-scale gas is
responsible for a luminosity-independent fraction of Compton-thin AGN, but does
not produce Compton-thick columns. With the host galaxy obscuration understood,
we present a model of the remaining, nuclear obscurer which is consistent with
a range of observations. Our radiation-lifted torus model consists of a
Compton-thick component ($f_{\text{cov}}\sim35\%$) and a Compton-thin component
($f_{\text{cov}}\sim40\%$), which depends on both black hole mass and
luminosity. This provides a useful summary of observational constraints for
torus modellers who attempt to reproduce this behaviour. It can also be
employed as a sub-grid recipe in cosmological simulations which do not resolve
the torus. We also investigate host-galaxy X-ray obscuration inside
cosmological, hydro-dynamic simulations (EAGLE, Illustris). The obscuration
from ray-traced galaxy gas can agree with observations, but is highly sensitive
to the chosen feedback assumptions.

gravitational-wave (GW) radiation and, if gas is present in the vicinity, also
an electromagnetic (EM) counterpart. In the standard picture, an EM outburst
will be produced when the binary ""decouples"" from the circum-binary disc and
starts ""squeezing"" the disc inside the secondary orbit, resulting in its quick
accretion on to the primary black hole. Here we use analytical arguments and
numerical simulations to show that the disc within about $20~R_S$ of a SMBH
survives the merger without being depleted. The reason is a ""second
decoupling"": the inner disc thickens due to tidal heating and inefficient
cooling, effectively decoupling from the interaction of the binary. We show
that this second decoupling quenches the heating sources in the disc ${\cal
O}(10^2)$ days before coalescence. This will render the peak UV/X-ray
luminosity significantly weaker than previously thought. After the merger, the
residual disc cools down and expands, merging with the outer disc rather than
being completely accreted. This results in continuous EM emission, hindering
the detection of the cut-off and re-brightening proposed in earlier studies.

This is partially motivated by the desire to reduce capital and reserve
requirements while retaining the value of mortality credits; see for example
Piggott, Valdez and Detzel (2005) or Donnelly, Guillen and Nielsen (2014). In
this paper we generalize the natural retirement income tontine introduced by
Milevsky and Salisbury (2015) by combining heterogeneous cohorts into one pool.
We engineer this scheme by allocating tontine shares at either a premium or a
discount to par based on both the age of the investor and the amount they
invest. For example, a 55 year-old allocating $\$10,000$ to the tontine might
be told to pay $\$$200 per share and receive 50 shares, while a 75 year-old
allocating $\$8,000$ might pay $\$$40 per share and receive 200 shares. They
would all be mixed together into the same tontine pool and each tontine share
would have equal income rights. The current paper addresses existence and
uniqueness issues and discusses the conditions under which this scheme can be
constructed equitably -- which is distinct from fairly -- even though it isn't
optimal for any cohort. As such, this also gives us the opportunity to compare
and contrast various pooling schemes that have been proposed in the literature

Earth radii there is a transition from a population of predominantly rocky
super-Earths to non-rocky sub-Neptunes, which must have substantial volatile
envelopes. Determining the origin of these highly irradiated rocky planets will
be critical to our understanding of low-mass planet formation and the frequency
of potentially habitable Earth-like planets. These short-period rocky
super-Earths could simply be the stripped cores of sub-Neptunes, which have
lost their envelopes due to atmospheric photo-evaporation or other processes,
or they might instead be a separate population of inherently rocky planets,
which never had significant envelopes. Using models of atmospheric
photo-evaporation, we show that if most bare rocky planets are the evaporated
cores of sub-Neptunes then the transition radius should decrease as surveys
push to longer orbital periods, since on wider orbits only planets with smaller
less massive cores can be stripped. On the other hand, if most rocky planets
formed after their disks dissipate then these planets will have formed without
initial gaseous envelopes. In this case, we use N-body simulations of planet
formation to show that the transition radius should increase with orbital
period, due to the increasing solid mass available in their disks. Moreover, we
show that distinguishing between these two scenarios should be possible in
coming years with radial velocity follow-up of planets found by TESS. Finally,
we discuss the broader implications of this work for current efforts to measure
$\eta_{\mathrm{\oplus}}$, which may yield significant overestimates if most
rocky planets form as evaporated cores.

pixels described herein build on the Mixed Mode Pixel Array Detector (MM-PAD)

maximum flux over the MM-PAD, which is capable of measuring a sustained flux in
excess of 10$^{8}$ x-rays/pixel/second while maintaining sensitivity to smaller
signals, down to single x-rays. To extend dynamic range, charge is removed from
the integration node of the front-end amplifier without interrupting
integration. The number of times this process occurs is recorded by a digital
counter in the pixel. The parameter limiting full well is thereby shifted from
the size of an integration capacitor to the depth of a digital counter. The
result is similar to that achieved by counting pixel array detectors, but the
integrators presented here are designed to tolerate a sustained flux >10$^{11}$
x-rays/pixel/second. Pixel front-end linearity was evaluated by direct current

maintain cytosolic and organellar pH levels within a narrow functional range.
These pumps employ two very different mechanisms: an elaborate rotary mechanism
used by V-ATPase H+ pumps, and a simpler alternating access mechanism used by
P-ATPase H+ pumps. Why are two different mechanisms used to perform the same
function? Systematic analysis, without parameter fitting, of kinetic models of
the rotary, alternating access and other possible mechanisms suggest that, when
the ratio of protons transported per ATP hydrolyzed exceeds one, the
one-at-a-time proton transport by the rotary mechanism is faster than other
possible mechanisms across a wide range of driving conditions. When the ratio
is one, there is no intrinsic difference in the free energy landscape between
mechanisms, and therefore all mechanisms can exhibit the same kinetic
performance. To our knowledge all known rotary pumps have an H+:ATP ratio
greater than one, and all known alternating access ATP-driven proton pumps have
a ratio of one. Our analysis suggests a possible explanation for this apparent
relationship between coupling ratio and mechanism. When the conditions under
which the pump must operate permit a coupling ratio greater than one, the
rotary mechanism may have been selected for its kinetic advantage. On the other
hand, when conditions require a coupling ratio of one or less, the alternating
access mechanism may have been selected for other possible advantages resulting
from its structural and functional simplicity.

conferencing between the BSs. Among few other features, our new coding scheme
enables arbitrary correlation among the auxiliary codewords that are recovered
by the BSs. It also introduces common codewords to be described to both BSs.
For the analysis of this coding scheme, we extend the multivariate covering
lemma to non-Cartesian product sets, thereby correcting an erroneous
application of this lemma in Liu-Kang's related work. We highlight key aspects
of this scheme by studying three important instances of it. The second coding
scheme extends the so-called compression scheme that was originally developed

memoryless C-RANs with BS cooperation. We show that this scheme subsumes the
original compression scheme when applied to memoryless Gaussian C-RAN models.

is that -- in contrast to existing models -- under-specification of the human

network analysis across various domains, most notably in bioinformatics and
social networks. The special case of triangle counting has received much
attention. Getting results for 4-vertex or 5-vertex patterns is highly
challenging, and there are few practical results known that can scale to
massive sizes.
  We introduce an algorithmic framework that can be adopted to count any small
pattern in a graph and apply this framework to compute exact counts for
\emph{all} 5-vertex subgraphs. Our framework is built on cutting a pattern into
smaller ones, and using counts of smaller patterns to get larger counts.
Furthermore, we exploit degree orientations of the graph to reduce runtimes
even further. These methods avoid the combinatorial explosion that typical
subgraph counting algorithms face. We prove that it suffices to enumerate only
four specific subgraphs (three of them have less than 5 vertices) to exactly
count all 5-vertex patterns.
  We perform extensive empirical experiments on a variety of real-world graphs.
We are able to compute counts of graphs with tens of millions of edges in
minutes on a commodity machine. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first
practical algorithm for $5$-vertex pattern counting that runs at this scale. A
stepping stone to our main algorithm is a fast method for counting all
$4$-vertex patterns. This algorithm is typically ten times faster than the

spectra of roughly half of the known members of Taurus, which are used to
refine their spectral types and extinctions. We also present an updated set of
near-IR standard spectra for classifying young stars and brown dwarfs at M and

However, achieving these objectives requires that storage be located and sized

energy storage systems which perform energy arbitrage and provide regulation

coupled Leaky Integrate-and-Fire (LIF) elements, which assimilate the exchange
of electrical signals between neurons. Earlier investigations have demonstrated
that non-local and hierarchical network connectivity often induces complex
synchronization patterns and chimera states in systems of coupled oscillators.
In the LIF system we show that if the elements are non-locally linked with
positive diffusive coupling in a ring architecture the system splits into a
number of alternating domains. Half of these domains contain elements, whose
potential stays near the threshold, while they are interrupted by active
domains, where the elements perform regular LIF oscillations. The active
domains move around the ring with constant velocity, depending on the system
parameters. The idea of introducing reflecting non-local coupling in LIF
networks originates from signal exchange between neurons residing in the two
hemispheres in the brain. We show evidence that this connectivity induces novel
complex spatial and temporal structures: for relatively extensive ranges of
parameter values the system splits in two coexisting domains, one domain where
all elements stay near-threshold and one where incoherent states develop with
multileveled mean phase velocity distribution.

detected in the VHE (very-high-energy, > 100 GeV) gamma-ray band. Aims. We
study the broadband spectral and temporal properties of the PKS 1510-089
emission during a high gamma-ray state. Methods. We performed VHE gamma-ray
observations of PKS 1510-089 with the MAGIC telescopes during a long high
gamma-ray state in May 2015. In order to perform broadband modelling of the
source, we have also gathered contemporaneous multiwavelength data in radio,
IR, optical photometry and polarization, UV, X-ray and GeV gamma-ray ranges. We
construct a broadband spectral energy distribution (SED) in two periods,
selected according to VHE gamma-ray state. Results. PKS 1510-089 has been
detected by MAGIC during a few day-long observations performed in the middle of
a long, high optical and gamma-ray state, showing for the first time a
significant VHE gamma-ray variability. Similarly to the optical and gamma-ray
high state of the source detected in 2012, it was accompanied by a rotation of
the optical polarization angle and the emission of a new jet component observed
in radio. However, due to large uncertainty on the knot separation time, the
association with the VHE gamma-ray emission cannot be firmly established. The
spectral shape in the VHE band during the flare is similar to the ones obtained
during previous measurements of the source. The observed flux variability sets
for the first time constraints on the size of the region from which VHE gamma
rays are emitted. We model the broadband SED in the framework of the external
Compton scenario and discuss the possible emission site in view of
multiwavelength data and alternative emission models.

to address this gap by studying the problem of recovering a dynamically

locally weighted matrix smoothing (LOWEMS) framework as one possible approach
to dynamic matrix recovery. We then establish error bounds for LOWEMS in both

levels of hundreds of miRNAs at a time. However, for actual diagnostic tools to
become reality requires the simultaneous development of methods to interpret
the large amounts of miRNA expression data that can be generated from a single

must be developed. Statistics such as p-values and log fold change give some
insight, but the diagnostic effectiveness of each miRNA test must first be

concept that interpolates between lax and pseudolimits: for a fixed family
$\Sigma$ of arrows of a 2-category $\mathcal{A}$, a $\sigma$-cone for a
$2$-functor $\mathcal{A} \stackrel{F}{\rightarrow} \mathcal{B}$ is a lax cone
such that the structural 2-cells corresponding to the arrows of $\Sigma$ are
invertible. The conical $\sigma$-limit of $F$ is the universal $\sigma$-cone.
Similary we define $\sigma$-natural transformations and weighted
$\sigma$-limits. We consider also the case of bilimits. We develop the theory
of $\sigma$-limits and $\sigma$-bilimits, whose importance relies on the
following key fact: any weighted $\sigma$-limit (or $\sigma$-bilimit) can be
expressed as a conical one. From this we obtain, in particular, a canonical
expression of an arbitrary $\mathcal{C}at$-valued 2-functor as a conical
$\sigma$-bicolimit of representable 2-functors, for a suitable choice of
$\Sigma$, which is equivalent to the well known bicoend formula.
  As an application, we establish the 2-dimensional theory of flat
pseudofunctors. We define a $\mathcal{C}at$-valued pseudofunctor to be flat
when its left bi-Kan extension along the Yoneda 2-functor preserves finite
weighted bilimits. We introduce a notion of 2-filteredness of a 2-category with
respect to a class $\Sigma$, which we call $\sigma$-filtered. Our main result
is: A pseudofunctor $\mathcal{A} \rightarrow \mathcal{C}at$ is flat if and only
if it is a $\sigma$-filtered $\sigma$-bicolimit of representable 2-functors. In
particular the reader will notice the relevance of this result for the
development of a theory of 2-topoi.

methods for authentication of quantum messages. The first method is an
interactive protocol (TQA') based on teleportation. The second method is a
noninteractive protocol (QA) in which the sender first encrypts the message
using a protocol QEnc and then encodes the quantum ciphertext with an error
correcting code chosen secretly from a set (a purity test code (PTC)).
Encryption was shown to be necessary for authentication.
  We augment the protocol QA with an extra step which recycles the entire
encryption key provided QA accepts the message. We analyze the resulting
integrated protocol for quantum authentication and key generation, which we
call QA+KG. Our main result is a proof that QA+KG is universal composably (UC)
secure in the Ben-Or-Mayers model (quant-ph/0409062). More specifically, this
implies the UC-security of (a) QA, (b) recycling of the encryption key in QA,
and (c) key-recycling of the encryption scheme QEnc by appending PTC. For an
m-qubit message, encryption requires 2m bits of key; but PTC can be performed
using only O(log m) + O(log e) bits of key for probability of failure e. Thus,
we reduce the key required for both QA and QEnc, from linear to logarithmic net
consumption, at the expense of one bit of back communication which can happen
any time after the conclusion of QA and before reusing the key. UC-security of
QA also extends security to settings not obvious from quant-ph/0205128.
  Our security proof structure is inspired by and similar to that of
quant-ph/0205128, reducing the security of QA to that of TQA'. In the process,
we define UC-secure entanglement, and prove the UC-security of the entanglement
generating protocol given in quant-ph/0205128, which could be of independent
interest.

(PP) under some unreliable and/or weaker interaction models. More precisely, we
focus on two features related to the power of interactions: omission failures
and one-way communications. An omission failure, a notion that this paper
introduces for the first time in the context of PP, is the loss by one or both
parties of the information transmitted in an interaction. The failure may or
may not be detected by either party. On the other hand, in one-way models,
communication happens only in one direction: only one of the two agents can
change its state depending on both agents' states, and the other agent may or
may not be aware of the interaction. These notions can be combined, obtaining
one-way protocols with (possibly detectable) omission failures.
  A general question is what additional power is necessary and sufficient to
completely overcome the weakness of one-way protocols and enable them to
simulate two-way protocols, with and without omission failures. As a basic
feature, a simulator needs to implement an atomic communication of states
between two agents; this task is further complicated by the anonymity of the
agents, their lack of knowledge of the system, and the limited amount of memory
that they may have.
  We provide the first answers to these questions by presenting and analyzing
several simulators, i.e., wrapper protocols converting any protocol for the
standard two-way model into one running on a weaker one.

metamaterials (MMs) made of low loss noble metals, such as gold, silver, etc.
In this work, we demonstrate that an anisotropic MM waveguide made of high loss
metal tungsten can also support the trapped rainbow effect similar to the noble
metal based structure. We show theoretically that an array of
tungsten/germanium anisotropic nano-cones placed on top of a reflective
substrate can absorb light at the wavelength range from 0.3 micrometer to 9
micrometer with an average absorption efficiency approaching 98%. It is found
that the excitation of multiple orders of slow-light resonant modes is
responsible for the efficient absorption at wavelengths longer than 2
micrometer, and the anti-reflection effect of tapered lossy material gives rise
to the near perfect absorption at shorter wavelengths. The absorption spectrum
suffers a small dip at around 4.2 micrometer where the first order and second
order slow-light modes get overlapped, but we can get rid of this dip if the
absorption band edge at long wavelength range is reduced down to 5 micrometer.
The parametrical study reflects that the absorption bandwidth is mainly
determined by the filling ratio of tungsten as well as the bottom diameter of
the nano-cones and the interaction between neighboring nano-cones is quite
weak. Our proposal has some potential applications in the areas of solar energy
harvesting and thermal emitters.

for cyclic operads earlier. We propose a generalization of this correspondence
from cyclic operads and dg duality to twisted modular operads and Feynman
transform. Specifically, for each twisted modular operad $\mathcal{P}$ (taking
values in dg-vector spaces over a field $k$ of characteristic 0), there is a
certain sheaf $\mathcal{F}$ associated with it on the moduli space of stable
metric graphs such that the Verdier dual sheaf $D\mathcal{F}$ is associated
with the Feynman transform $F\mathcal{P}$ of $\mathcal{P}$. In the course of
the proof, we also prove a relation between cyclic operads and modular operads
originally proposed in the pioneering work of Getzler and Kapranov; however, to
the best knowledge of the author, no proof has been given in any literature.
This geometric interpretation in operad theory is of fundamental importance. We
believe this result will illuminate many aspects of the theory of modular
operads and find many applications in the future. We illustrate an application
of this result, giving another proof on the homotopy properties of Feynman
transform, which is quite intuitive and simpler than the original proof.

processes that operate far from equilibrium without detailed-balance dynamics.
Yet, they often exhibit well defined nonequilibrium steady states (NESSs). More
importantly, critical thermodynamic functionality arises directly from
transitions among their NESSs, driven by environmental switching. Here, we
identify constraints on excess thermodynamic quantities that ride above the
NESS housekeeping background. We do this by extending the Crooks fluctuation
theorem to transitions among NESSs, without invoking an unphysical dual
dynamics. This and corresponding integral fluctuation theorems determine how
much work must be expended when controlling systems maintained far from
equilibrium. This generalizes feedback control theory, showing that Maxwellian
Demons can leverage mesoscopic-state information to take advantage of the
excess energetics in NESS transitions. Altogether, these point to universal
thermodynamic laws that are immediately applicable to the accessible degrees of
freedom within the effective dynamic at any emergent level of hierarchical
organization. By way of illustration, this readily allows analyzing a
voltage-gated sodium ion channel whose molecular conformational dynamics play a

sight, but there is mutual gravitational influence between them which leads to
the small but definite eccentricity 0.0035(0.0022) on the short 2.2799960 days
period orbit. KIC 7668648 is hierarchical quadruple system candidate, with two
sets of solid 203(+-5) days period extraneous eclipses and another independent
set of extraneous eclipses. A clear and credible extraneous eclipse is found on
the binary light curve of KIC 7670485 which made it a triple system candidates.
Two sets of extraneous eclipse of about 390 days and 220 days period are found
on KIC 8938628 binary curves, which not only confirms the previous conclusion
of $388.5(+-0.3) triple system, but also proposed a new additional objects that
make KIC 8938628 a hierarchical quadruple system candidates. It is wished that
the four candidates here will make some contributions to the field of eclipsing

the messages available at all the transmitters per channel use, normalized by
the number of users. For Wyner's linear interference network, where each
transmitter is connected to the receiver having the same index as well as one
succeeding receiver, the per user DoF is characterized and the optimal scheme
is presented. Furthermore, it is shown that the optimal assignment of messages
to transmitters is asymmetric and satisfies a local cooperation constraint, and
that the optimal coding scheme relies only on one-shot cooperative zero-forcing
transmit beamforming. Using insights from the analysis of Wyner's linear
interference network, the results are extended to the more practical hexagonal
sectored cellular network, and coding schemes based on cooperative zero-forcing
are shown to deliver significant DoF gains. It is established that by allowing
for cooperative transmission and a flexible message assignment that is
constrained only by an average backhaul load, one can deliver the rate gains
promised by information-theoretic upper bounds with practical one-shot schemes
that incur little or no additional load on the backhaul. Finally, useful upper
bounds on the per user DoF for schemes based on cooperative zero-forcing are
presented for lower values of the average backhaul load constraint, and an
optimization framework is formulated for the general converse problem.

common nowadays, especially in astronomy and astrophysics where black and white
colours form the main components. Additive noise of Gaussian type is the most
common form of noise to be studied and analysed in majority of communication

  and the number of elliptic curves of bounded conductor","22 pages, 5 figures",,,,"math.NT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We propose a new model for counting $\mathbf{GL}_2(\mathbb{F}_p)$-number
fields having the same local properties as the splitting field of the mod
$p$-Galois representation associated with an elliptic curve over the rational
numbers. We explain how this new model and Bhargava's local-to-global
heuristics for counting $\mathbf{GL}_2(\mathbb{F}_p)$-number fields both shed
light on the problem of estimating the number of elliptic curves over the
rational numbers of squarefree conductor $N < X.$
  The new model predicts the existence of significantly more
$\mathbf{GL}_2(\mathbb{F}_p)$-number fields with the desired local properties
than does the local-to-global model when $N$ has a large number of distinct
prime factors, owing to degeneracies caused by Atkin-Lehner involutions. We
describe computational evidence supporting the new model.

two charge density (CDW) phase transitions, which were proposed recently to be
closely related to the newly identified Dirac cone. We present optical
spectroscopy and ultrafast pump-probe measurement on the compound. The
development of energy gaps were clearly observed below the phase transition
temperatures in optical conductivity, which removes most part of the free
carrier spectral weight. Time resolved measurement demonstrated the emergence
of strong oscillations upon entering the CDW states, which were illuminated to
come from the amplitude mode of CDW collective excitations. The frequencies of
them are surprisingly low: only 0.12 THz for the CDW order with higher
transition temperature and 0.34 THz for the lower one, which shall be caused by
their small modulation wave vectors. Furthermore, the amplitude and relaxation
time of photoinduced reflectivity stayed unchanged across the two phase
transitions, which might be connected to the extremely low energy scales of
amplitude modes.

(or more generally, compactly generated locally compact) groups satisfying a
strong negation of being finitely presented, in the sense that new relations
appear at all scales. Here, new relations means relations that do not follow
from relations of smaller size. Being densely related is a quasi-isometry
invariant among finitely generated groups.
  We check that a densely related group has none of its asymptotic cones simply
connected. In particular a lacunary hyperbolic group cannot be densely related.
  We prove that the Grigorchuk group is densely related. We also show that a
finitely generated group that is (infinite locally finite)-by-cyclic and which
satisfies a law must be densely related. Given a class $\mathcal{C}$ of
finitely generated groups, we consider the following dichotomy: every group in
$\mathcal{C}$ is either finitely presented or densely related. We show that
this holds within the class of nilpotent-by-cyclic groups and the class of
metabelian groups. In contrast, this dichotomy is no longer true for the class
of $3$-step solvable groups.

  reservoir",,,,,"physics.flu-dyn","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  It is usually assumed that hydraulic fracture has two symmetrical wings with
respect to the fluid injection point. Hence, authors limit themselves to
modelling of one half of the fracture. In our work we demonstrate that the case
of a symmetrical fracture occurs only in a homogeneous reservoir with constant
physical parameters and confining {\it in situ} stress. Otherwise,
inhomogeneity in the stress or the rock permeability can significantly change
the dynamics of the fracture propagation. The mathematical model of the
hydraulic fracturing used in the paper is adopted from our earlier work
\cite{Golovin_Baykin_2016_Pore}. In present paper we perform numerical
experiments demonstrating that in case of non-constant confining stress or
reservoir permeability the fracture is developing non-symmetrically. An
important role is played by the action of the backstress that is formed near
the fracture due to the pore pressure. To support this observation we give a
formal definition of the backstress and compare the values of the backstress
acting on the two different fracture wings. These numerical experiments
underline the importance of the proper modelling of the interaction between
pore and fracturing fluids for the correct simulation of the hydraulic
fracturing.

corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 3fb$^{-1}$, collected with the
LHCb detector at centre-of-mass energies of 7 and 8 TeV. The flavour of the
charm meson at production is determined from the charge of the pion in
$D^{*+}\rightarrow D^0 \pi^+$ and $D^{*-}\rightarrow \bar{D^0} \pi^-$ decays.
The time-integrated $CP$ asymmetry $A_{CP}(K^-K^+)$ is obtained assuming
negligible $CP$ violation in charm mixing and in Cabibbo-favoured
$D^0\rightarrow K^-\pi^+$, $D^+\rightarrow K^-\pi^+\pi^+$ and $D^+\rightarrow
\bar{K^0}\pi^+$ decays used as calibration channels. It is found to be
$A_{CP}(K^-K^+)=(0.14\pm0.15(stat)\pm0.10(syst))\%$. A combination of this
result with previous LHCb measurements yields
$A_{CP}(K^-K^+)=(0.04\pm0.12(stat)\pm0.10(syst))\%$,
$A_{CP}(\pi^-\pi^+)=(0.07\pm0.14(stat)\pm0.11(syst))\%$. These are the most
precise measurements from a single experiment. The result for $A_{CP}(K^-K^+)$
is the most precise determination of a time-integrated $CP$ asymmetry in the
charm sector to date, and neither measurement shows evidence of CP asymmetry.

to mitigate state differences among dynamic nodes on a graph. It has been
successfully employed in various applications, e.g., formation control of

existing applications cast an impression of consensus as a simple process to
iteratively reach agreement, without any clue on possibility to generate
advanced complexity, say shortest path planning, which has been proved to be
NP-hard. Counter-intuitively, we show for the first time that the complexity of
shortest path planning can emerge from a perturbed version of min-consensus
protocol, which as a case study may shed lights to researchers in the field of
distributed control to re-think the nature of complexity and the distance
between control and intelligence. Besides, we rigorously prove the convergence

illustrative simulation on a small scale graph is provided to show the
convergence of the biased min-consensus dynamics to shortest path solution over

agnostic. Then, a set of people is chosen from the outside and convinced to
start evangelizing, i.e., to start spreading the information. When a number of

optimizing the Contrast-to-Noise Ratio (CNR) in Susceptibility Weighted Images
(SWI) acquired using autocalibrating partially parallel techniques. The
unwrapped phase images of each coil are filtered using local random field based
probabilistic weights, derived using energy functions representative of noisy
sensitivity and tissue information pertaining to venous structure in the
individual channel phase images. The channel energy functions are obtained as
functions of local image intensities, first or second order clique phase
difference and a threshold scaling parameter dependent on the input noise
level. Whereas the expectation of the individual energy functions with respect
to the noise distribution in clique phase differences is to be maximized for
optimal filtering, the expectation of tissue energy function decreases and
noise energy function increases with increase in threshold scale parameter. The
optimum scaling parameter is shown to occur at the point where expectations of
both energy functions contribute to the largest possible extent. It is shown
that implementation of the filter in the same lines as that of Iterated
Conditional Modes (ICM) algorithm provides structural enhancement in the coil
combined phase, with reduced noise amplification. Application to simulated and
in vivo multi-channel SWI shows that CNR of combined phase obtained using
MAP-MRF filter is higher as compared to that of coil combination using weighted
average.

refer to the same real-world entity. In many scenarios, raw records are stored
under heterogeneous environment. Specifically, the schemas of records may
differ from each other. To leverage such records better, most existing work
assume that schema matching and data exchange have been done to convert records
under different schemas to those under a predefined schema. However, we observe
that schema matching would lose information in some cases, which could be
useful or even crucial to ER.
  To leverage sufficient information from heterogeneous sources, in this paper,
we address several challenges of ER on heterogeneous records and show that none
of existing similarity metrics or their transformations could be applied to
find similar records under heterogeneous settings. Motivated by this, we design
the similarity function and propose a novel framework to iteratively find
records which refer to the same entity. Regarding efficiency, we build an index
to generate candidates and accelerate similarity computation. Evaluations on
real-world datasets show the effectiveness and efficiency of our methods.

(especially with KAGRA owing to its location at less seismic noise), we are
able to detect the ring-down gravitational wave of a BH with the mass $M <
2\times 10^3 M_\odot $. This enables us to check the sequence of BH mergers to
SMBHs via intermediate-mass BHs. We estimate the number density of galaxies
from the halo formation model and estimate the number of BH mergers from the

the designed KAGRA (and/or advanced LIGO/VIRGO), we find that the BH merger of
its total mass $M\sim 60M_\odot$ is at the peak of the expected mass
distribution. With its signal-to-noise ratio $\rho=10 (30)$, we estimate the
event rate $R \sim 200 (20)$ per year in the most optimistic case, and we also
find that BH mergers in the range $M < 150 M_\odot$ are $R>1$ per year for
$\rho=10$. Thus, if we observe a BH with more than $100 M_\odot$ in future
gravitational-wave observations, our model naturally explains its source.

should consider both efficiency and effectiveness issues. For efficiency, the
approach should achieve high performance and be scalability to fit large data
source amount. From effectiveness aspect, data quality and overlapping of
sources are to be considered, since data quality varies much from data sources,
with significant differences in the accuracy and coverage of the data provided,
and the overlapping of sources can even lower the quality of data integrated

extracting patterns from temporal sequences. However, current RNN models are
ill-suited to process irregularly sampled data triggered by events generated in
continuous time by sensors or other neurons. Such data can occur, for example,
when the input comes from novel event-driven artificial sensors that generate
sparse, asynchronous streams of events or from multiple conventional sensors
with different update intervals. In this work, we introduce the Phased LSTM
model, which extends the LSTM unit by adding a new time gate. This gate is
controlled by a parametrized oscillation with a frequency range that produces
updates of the memory cell only during a small percentage of the cycle. Even
with the sparse updates imposed by the oscillation, the Phased LSTM network
achieves faster convergence than regular LSTMs on tasks which require learning
of long sequences. The model naturally integrates inputs from sensors of
arbitrary sampling rates, thereby opening new areas of investigation for
processing asynchronous sensory events that carry timing information. It also
greatly improves the performance of LSTMs in standard RNN applications, and
does so with an order-of-magnitude fewer computes at runtime.

in the usual AB effect but since such pseudo field is supposed to be induced by
elastic deformations, the quantization of the field flux is abandoned. For
certain constraints on the orbital angular momentum eigenvalues allowed for the
system, we can observe the zero Landau level failing to develop, due to the
degeneracy related to the Dirac valleys $K$ and $K^\prime$ which is broken. For
integer values of the pseudo AB flux, the actual quantum Hall effect is
preserved. Obtaining the Hall conductivity by summing over all orbital angular
momentum eigenvalues, the zero Landau levels is recovered. Since our problem is
closed related to the case where topological defects on a graphene sheet are
present, the questions posed here are helpful if one is interested to probe the

a large-scale successive interference cancelation (SIC)-enabled wireless

early. And, while this design appealed to the gambling instinc}, it is a
suboptimal way to generate retirement income. Indeed, actuarially-fair life
annuities making constant payments -- where the insurance company is exposed to
longevity risk -- induce greater lifetime utility. However, tontines do not
have to be structured the historical way, i.e. with a constant cash flow shared
amongst a shrinking group of survivors. Moreover, insurance companies do not
sell actuarially-fair life annuities, in part due to aggregate longevity risk.
  We derive the tontine structure that maximizes lifetime utility. Technically
speaking we solve the Euler-Lagrange equation and examine its sensitivity to
(i.) the size of the tontine pool $n$, and (ii.) individual longevity risk
aversion $\gamma$. We examine how the optimal tontine varies with $\gamma$ and
$n$, and prove some qualitative theorems about the optimal payout.
Interestingly, Lorenzo de Tonti's original structure is optimal in the limit as
longevity risk aversion $\gamma \to \infty$. We define the natural tontine as
the function for which the payout declines in exact proportion to the survival
probabilities, which we show is near-optimal for all $\gamma$ and $n$. We
conclude by comparing the utility of optimal tontines to the utility of loaded
life annuities under reasonable demographic and economic conditions and find
that the life annuity's advantage over the optimal tontine is minimal.
  In sum, this paper's contribution is to (i.) rekindle a discussion about a
retirement income product that has been long neglected, and (ii.) leverage
economic theory as well as tools from mathematical finance to design the next
generation of tontine annuities.

influence on the spatial parameters of complex-octonion curved space, including
the metric coefficient, connection coefficient, and curvature tensor. In the
flat space described with the complex octonions, the radius vector is combined
with the integrating function of field potential to become a composite radius
vector. And the latter can be considered as the radius vector in a flat
composite-space (a function space). Further it is able to deduce some formulae
between the physical quantity and spatial parameter, in the complex-octonion
curved composite-space. Under the condition of weak field approximation, these
formulae infer a few results accordant with the General Theory of Relativity.
The study reveals that it is capable of ascertaining which physical quantities
are able to result in the warping of space, in terms of the curved
composite-space described with the complex octonions. Moreover, the method may
be expanded into some curved function spaces, seeking out more possible
physical quantities to impact the bending degree of curved spaces.

problem. As its name suggests, the constrained lasso extends the widely-used
lasso to handle linear constraints, which allow the user to incorporate prior
information into the model. In addition to quadratic programming, we employ the
alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) and also derive an efficient
solution path algorithm. Through both simulations and real data examples, we
compare the different algorithms and provide practical recommendations in terms
of efficiency and accuracy for various sizes of data. We also show that, for an
arbitrary penalty matrix, the generalized lasso can be transformed to a
constrained lasso, while the converse is not true. Thus, our methods can also
be used for estimating a generalized lasso, which has wide-ranging
applications. Code for implementing the algorithms is freely available in the
Matlab toolbox SparseReg.

others directly or indirectly by means of social mechanisms, such as taxation,
public services and so on. Employing a spatial public goods game, we study the
influence of income redistribution on the evolution of cooperation. Two kinds
of evolutionary models are constructed, which describe local and global
redistribution of income respectively. In the local model, players have to pay
part of their income after each PGG and the accumulated income is redistributed
to the members. While in the global model, all the players pay part of their
income after engaging in all the local PGGs, which are centered on himself and
his nearest neighbours, and the accumulated income is redistributed to the
whole population. We show that the cooperation prospers significantly with
increasing income expenditure proportion in the local redistribution of income,
while in the global model the situation is opposite. Furthermore, the
cooperation drops dramatically from the maximum curvature point of income
expenditure proportion. In particular, the intermediate critical points are
closely related to the renormalized enhancement factors.

context of asyn- chronous markets, we present methodologies and results of
empirical analysis of their returns. In particular, we dissect their returns
into intraday and overnight com- ponents with respect to the U.S. market hours.
The return difference between the S&P500 index, traded through the SPDR S&P500
ETF (SPY), and each ADR is found to be a mean-reverting time series, and is
fitted to an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process via maximum-likelihood estimation
(MLE). Our empirical observations also lead us to develop and backtest pairs
trading strategies to exploit the mean-reverting ADR-SPY spreads. We find
consistent positive payoffs when long position in ADR and short position in SPY
are simultaneously executed at selected entry and exit levels.

4-dimensional lattice. We mainly investigate a discrete scattering operator

maximal total energy, respectively. The operator $S(x_0,r)$ is used to define
transition amplitudes which are then employed to compute transition
probabilities. These probabilities are conditioned on the time-energy
$(x_0,r)$. In order to maintain total unit probability, the transition
probabilities need to be reconditioned at each $(x_0,r)$. This is roughly
analogous to renormalization in standard quantum field theory, except no
infinities or singularities are involved. We illustrate this theory with a
simple scattering experiment involving a common interaction Hamiltonian. We
briefly mention how discreteness of spacetime might be tested astronomically.
Moreover, these tests may explain the existence of dark energy and dark matter.
